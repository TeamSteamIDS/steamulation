												This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008.  So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist. I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.			"

												Counter-Strike: Ok, after 9 years of unlimited fun with friends, I have finally quit counter strike. Counter strike, in all of its versions, its just a great FPS game that anyone can enjoy it. Its a great game and all, you just cant stop playing it, you can just sit and play with your friends for days with out stoping. The huge weaoponary option you can choose and the smooth and sound of the game, its just f*cking addicting. With this games I've met so many different people and unique friends. This game is literally G(OLD). To all the young players who are looking for a good cheep and fun game to play with their friends, I highlly recommend on this. I've got (with steam record) 2,484hrs record in counter strike IN TOTTAL,,, and who knows how many more hrs in a non official steam version of this game.... Great Game. GG WP.And too all the people who will keep playing this game, all I can say, as always,  GL & HF <3			"

												CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the bestgame to ever have a crosshair. It is not a contact sport, so for the girly girls, it is an activity to indulge in.It starts off with a team trying to kill another team. I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer. I started inviting a lot of friends out and getting drinks, as well as a boom box, to spend a nice summer day in the living room playing this wonderful game. I wanted to play every chance that i could. On my road of cs adventures, I encountered a couple of problems; those being that nobody was as fervent as I was about playing, and that when we did play, nobody was good enough, so it wasn't a lot of fun.Then I discovered that I could sign up for a class with dboorn. I was overly excited, and signed up, but with skepticism at how the class was going to be. Sure enough, I was proven wrong. We started off by practicing a little bit. Then we split off into teams and started playing almost everyday of class. I made some friends, and played with people who had built up their skill gradually over the period of the course.When I play counterstrike, the whole world disappears. Only I, the mouse, and my teammates remain. We are united in a common goal. We strive collectively towards an end we all desire. Each player has a spot to hold. They stand ready and waiting, eager for their chance to aid the team in what they hope will be a forthcoming victory. Thus, CS celebrates the unity of man, the indomitable spirit in all of us that pushes us and drives us towards excellence. When I play CS, I play until my veins pump battery acid, and then I play some more.CS is unique among the games because it teaches all of us that no matter where we are in life, there is a role for us to play, and we can help our fellow man by fulfilling that role, and thereby our destiny. What destiny might you ask? I spoke before of unity. And it is that unity that brings us all together like one big loving family. That is the nature of counter-strike; the many working as one. One machine made of well oiled cogs and wheels, moving in unison, happy to play their part in the production of something greater than themselves. Not that these small metal objects are actually animate, I'm of course speaking only metaphorically.Over the course of the years, I have increased in skill, but I have learned a greater lesson than how to be a better cs player. I have learned how to cooperate with a team to accomplish a goal that we all share. Even if that team is less than ideal. I have realized that cs is about more than just one's athletic ability. Instead, there is a deeper meaning behind the colt, the AK, the AWP, the deagle, the sands under my feet (in d2 or inferno). And more importantly, the teammates at my side. I love them. It is the human element of cs that gives cs its greatness.In conclusion, I love cs. I love to win. I love pushing myself to my physical limits. It's that feeling that first drove me to the computer. For every second that I am not playing cs, there is only an unquenchable thirst to play. A thirst that grows as every minute passes by when I am outside, sitting at the television, or playing sports. I had an extraordinary time playing this game, and I will return to look at the future students of this game to see that bright eager look on their faces to remind me of how I used to feel. This review may be over, this game may be dead, but I will never stop playing couner-strike (1.6).			"

Review 21/10/2014:I've played this game since I was around 6 years old back in 2002 and it still makes me laugh and have fun whenever I launch it to this very day. Over 12 years of endless entertainment. No other game on this planet has given me more entertainment and enjoyment than Counter-Strike 1.6 has and I doubt no game ever will.Reason i've only got 38 hours here is because I no longer use the account I originally played cs 1.6 on.func_vehicle is what makes this Counter Strike game the best out of all the others in the franchise.Find a server that has car maps or maps with func_vehicle entities and you will have endless fun running over teammates and enemies in all kinds of hilarious and goofy vehicles not giving a care in the world.You can drive a fork with a meatball on the end of it. Do i need to say more?Mods on this game are amazing too. There is a mod where you can catch pokemon, level them up, train them and use their skills. Call of Duty mod that is suprisingly better than cod its self, Warcraft mods, zombie mods, basebuilder and so on...There is even a map for the jailbreak gamemode that has driveable snowmobiles. 1337/10Leet crew 5 lyfKicks csgo's ♥♥♥ by a mile. I forgot how good wallbanging is in this game.P.S - CS 1.6 is the only Counter Strike game where you can headshot with a knife or buy Riot Shields. Enjoy!Oh yeah, you don't have to pay to use sprays in this game either.			"

												First of all its my first online game ever. I was very young and i was playing with my friends LAN matches sometimes for fun sometimes with bets the loser treats refreshments. xD This game its the reason that i maked my mum to buy me a PC to playing this game at my home. With the time i learn how to modding on CS 1.6 servers,plugins and more stuffs about PC. After this i learn how to aim on the enemy head, how to fire inside the walls, how to hear someone with his steps and HOW TO FIGHT!!! I have played many FPS(First Person Shooter) Games that they called me hacker of my fast killing.I had so fyckin good and bad moments on that game that i will not forget never.For others its only a game for me it was MY LIFE! This wasnt a review but a little story.SO COUNTER-STRIKE FTW ♥♥♥♥♥♥ES!!			"

After 14 years of existence, this legendary game is still in the Steam top 10 most played multiplayers in the world.While earning tons of money based on Counter-Strike sales, Valve shows its appreciation to the players that bought the game by still not maintaining it and treating it like it doesn't even exist. Even more, starting with February 2013, Valve has released a couple of minor updates for Counter-Strike which intentionally created problems for the game(suddenly stopping afterwards) so that the players would be forced to migrate to and buy CS:GO(which currently has and most probably will keep having major problems like fps drops and hit misdetection - problem present on all Source engine based multiplayers since 2004). Congratulations, Valve.Counting the players that migrated to or play the non-Steam version of Counter-Strike, the game still easily classifies itself even today in the top 5 most played multiplayers in the world.

												""Lock and Load.""""Go go go!""""Fire in the hole!""""The bomb has been planted.""""Counter-terrorists/terrorists Win.""It is uncountable just how many times have these few sentences echoed in cybercafés across the world. For many, days were spent in front of the computer screen, manipulating the WASD keys with left hand and whirling the mouse with the right one. People yell and frown, they cheer and jeer as they team up their cyber-persona and pit them against another team. It doesn’t matter who won, who lost, who managed to kill to most of their opponents and who died the most, as everything will be scrambled up and reset when a new match begins. What is important is that, for those who are a part of the team, this computer game is their reality. These personas within the computer screen are their true identities. This is counter-strike. Originally a modification (mod in short) made for Valve’s critically acclaimed Half-Life, Counter-Strike has gained much prominence since its initial launch. It is one of the first and definitely one of the most critically acclaimed multi-player computer games of all times. It is also the game used for many professional electronic sports competitions, such as ESEA League. Of course, this does not put Counter-Strike as a “professional only” game, as it has been enjoyed by many since its launch.Getting started with Counter-strike is simple. You start off in one of the two teams: Counter-Terrorists or Terrorists. Before the round begins, you will have to purchase your own gun from the market, namely the famous AK47, M4A1, Desert Eagle, MP5, AWP and many more. Do not ask me why the counter-terrorists (namely the police) have to buy their own gun, and that they will have to go out with their lousy default colt pistols. Perhaps the government had some budget cuts and the SWATs have to buy their own guns. No one knows, but at least this will balance up the game. Also, you can equipment such as Highly-Explosive grenades, Flash-bangs (not recommend for beginners), smoke grenades, helmets and kevlars. You can also grab a defuse kit if you are playing on the side of the counter-terrorist, but normally we will steal that from dead teammates. Oh and you will be given a knife for free. Don’t worry about it, as most likely you use it to run instead of anything else.The gameplay is fairly straightforward as well. There are quite a few number of game mods. The most frequently played ones are the Bomb Defusal maps, such as the all-time famous de_dust, the Hostage Rescue maps such as cs_assault, the VIP Escorting maps and the Kill Them All maps, such as the custom fy_iceworld and awp_map. Like all multi-player First Person Shooters, you will need good coordination and communication with your teammates if you want to win. Don’t worry about it though, because if you are new, just stick around and listen to what others have got to say. Just remember, you are not John Rambo, you only have 100 HP, and a stray bullet from a sniper rifle (AWP) will deal more damage than that.As time press on, the mechanism of Counter-Strike became outdate. Of course, the legacy of Counter-Strike continues through its successors such as Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, Counter-Strike: Source, Counter-Strike Online (Asia only) and, the newest of all, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Throughout the years, Counter-Strike has evolved to become what it is today while its legend remains. Together with Half-Life and (maybe) Team Fortress Classic, Counter-Strike has not only helped Valve to thrive as a gaming company, but also defined what First Person Shooter should be.			"

												Counter-Strike is a great series. Though the real change they made was in CS:GO, Counter-Strike has been one of my favorite FPS games of all time. If you prefer a fast based shooter, this game isn't for you.Counter-Strike can have exciting moments where it's you VS 5 others, or where you have no defuse kit with only a few seconds left to defuse the bombA comparable version of Counter-Strike's defuse gametype is the Call Of Duty ""Search and Destroy""			"

Counter-Strike 1.6Counter-Strike 1.6 is the newest Point-and-Click Adventure from the makers of the hit game Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies. Don't be mistaken by the rather plain name, though, as this is not simply another uninspired reboot of that beloved Uninstallation Simulation game; no, Counter-Strike 1.6 is the real deal! The mechanics and gameplay are top-notch. You can jump like you're in the Matrix, run almost silently by bouncing across the ground on your butt, shoot through a quarter-mile of stone or concrete, plaster X-rated images on walls to distract teammates and enemies alike, or spraypaint fake doors and ladders and watch them all run head-first into walls! There are ladders in de_dust2?? Who knew!But as hinted above, it's the physics that really make this game wonderful. Some people see a cliff-face, others see a surfin' safari. Can't figure out how your teammate jumped on that wall? Spend fifty hours failing and falling to your death, and if you're good, you just might get there too! A quick server mod will let you jump in the air, and with some practice and you can move as fast as that guy with 500 ping whose approaching footsteps sounded like a small-caliber machine gun as he shot your whole team in the face with a scout in under a second! Also, remember, kids: everyone knows you run faster with a knife. And even faster with a scout. Haven't gotten accused of speedhacking yet? What about aimbotting?""BOOM! HEADSHOT!!""With hundreds of hours of walking in circles around epically-plain sandstone ruins searching for the last cowering, brainless zombie to click on, this game will keep you bunny-hopping back for more!

												First starting off as a cute, little mod based on the GoldSrc engine, a heavily modified Quake engine, Counter-Strike's legacy continues to strife for a decade and a half over. Initially developed and released on top of a Half-Life modification, with the inspiration from the developer's strong theme and intriguement for military warfare and terrorism, the mod's success was immediately a marvel to behold; selling over 25 million units as a whole in the Counter-Strike franchise.The maps and various scenarios set around the globe, players assume the roles of soldiers on two teams, counter-terrorists and terrorists. Both with a task, depending differently on the mission. Bomb scenarios, the terrorist team must plant a bomb, in a secured bomb location, while the counter-terrorists must fight back and ultimately defuse the bomb, if it may have been planted. Hostage scenarios is where the counter-terrorists must rescue a group of hostages being held by the terrorists. With both these modes, it has become a traditional campaign over time in different sequels.The player, depending on what team they have been assigned to, can change their class into eight different character models, as well as buying weaponry and equipment, such as armour and grenades to help against the opposing team. As the round is about to begin, you're left in ''Freeze time'' that allows you to buy things with the money you earned by killing opponents the rounds before. This of course, gives players the time needed to choose wisely on what many strategies they will execute and whether it will be successful compared to your opponents. This game is also highly customizable on the player's end.The game gives the options allowing for the user to either install or create their own custom skins, spray graphics, sprites, sound effects and HUDS that can be used in-game. I forgot to mention that modding is possibly one the biggest things that makes Counter-Strike such a versatile game to begin with.I don't have much to complain about this game, other than it's become one of the biggest targets of hacking and cheaters, since its release. Aimbots, that auto-target other players while the player should naturally aim and shoot is just on of the many cheatings that players have executed. Wallhacks, that allows the player to see through walls through work by displaying objects that have translucent textures and can easily see targets through them, while the opposing team has no idea from their own perspective. To me, the cheating in this game is now more to do with experimenting than it is to do with cheating overall. There's a different meaning when it comes to something that is outdated and old-school. Old-school is for nostalgic value, something that will guarantee to put a smile back on your face from all these past memories you've experienced and this is what the first title of Counter-Strike engulfs. Outdated, being something you don't particularly want to go back to, while there is the famous remake, Counter-Strike: Source, that runs on the more powerful and overly-recycled Source engine, allowing for better graphic and communication capabilities. Nevertheless, if you're looking for original flare that is burning in the Counter-Strike series, this game is definitely for you.And to think, all of this success for the Counter-Strike series began as small little mod. Proof on how something so little, can create something so big. Recommended.			"

												Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game from Valve, the first of the Counter-Strike series.Play the world's number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.			"

												This game appears to remain No. 1 FPS Action games since 2000 for around 8 to 11 years. It is a intense game as your health and your exposure is important as well sticking together with your team mates at all costs. You should maybe try this game and learn the routes in common CS maps like dust or assault. Go on try it!However they are a several downsides to this game like the weapon nerfs like the recoils and smoke grenade failing to detonate airborne and the lame Tactical Shield. And cos this game is so popular that thousands of servers host this game online, that some PC criminals tend to take advantage on players like using hacking or server addon hacking materials. So you maybe best to stay clear of weird or dodgy servers with extreme adult material and Steam cannot unban victims who got hijacked and VAC banned, so please be careful!But if you are old and wise enough to handle this intense action game...BUY IT, SOLDIER!

												Simply THE best shooter that you can play, to forget the anger that built up inside of you after playing too much CS:GO.It truely is a relief to play another shooter than CS:GO, without messing with your aim, movement, etc. Just set everything up the way it is in CS:GO (sensitivity, key-binds, etc.) and escape from the austerity pressure to perform well in CS:GO. And RELAX theres nothing you can do wrong here. Even when there's a cheater, just don't give a f. I mean, there isn't even a stats-record. Like there's only a serversided stats-tracking if at all. So without specifically searching for your stats on a specific server that has some kind of player-stats on it, nobody will ever know how bad you are/were :)			"

												Counter Strike is the best shooting game, i've ever played. The 'real cs', where you plant bombs etc. is not 10/10 gaming, but look at all those great mods! The greatest thing in cs is playing mod servers, and you do not need to download them from your web, you just simply double click that server, and that's it! At first I recommend to play normal cs, if it gets boring try other servers. Oh and original maps aren't that great, except de_dust2. You must try cs even if you think it has low graphics. Gameplay is much more important than graphics, remember that!			"

Because this game's focus isn't on graphics. It's for having fun with your friends, or, even aim for world turnaments.All proffesional teams, such as fnatic, navi, sk, still play Counter-Strike, doesn't matter if it is 1.6, Source or Global Offensive.

												One of the most favourite game of my childhood I have spent so much time playing it and I loved it.From a little cute Half-Life mod to this... When Counter-Strike was first released it gained it's popularity immediately and become number 1 online action game, one of the most successful competitive games ever created which was easy to learn but hard to master, now Counter-Strike is dead or at least for someone because it's pro scene died in 2012, yes the pro scene is dead but the game itself is still alive, after so many years people still play and love this game, even it's pro scene lasted for unreal time, imagine it started in 2000 year and lasted for 12 years how cannot this be legendary, it's when graphics doesn't matter only gameplay.I strongly recommend to play this game at least once if you have ever played it and enjoyed, it might not be as fun as before but I still recommend, if you like original games or havent played CS at all and started from CS:S, CS:GO doesn't matter... You should really give it a try.			"

												Counter-Strike: Originally released as a Half-Life Modification but then became a Valve product in 2000 Then later becoming one of the Most online played game ever...Counter-Strike is a Realistic first person tactical shooter game that is based on Terrorism and Counter Terrorism. The main goal of the game is that you either have to plant the bomb at a certain bomb site ""A"" or ""B"" within the map as a Terrorist or Capture the Hostages and taking them back to your Spawn to win the round as a Counter-Terrorist. The gameplay is fun and simple but however very Competitive and requires a set of Skills.Gameplay: So there are two teams ""Terrorist"" and ""Counter-Terrorist"" each team will have one Simple task. As a Counter-Terrorist you'll usally be Rescuing the Hostages or Defusing Bombs, And you will have a Time limit each round to complete your Objectives. With the Terrorist team they'll be doing the opposite Objective than the Counter-Terrorist by Planting the bombs and trying to protect the Hostages from not being Captured. The gameplay is very fun and competitive. When winning a round, Killing an enemy, You'll be rewarded with Money and you use that Money to buy Weapons, Grenades and ammo. What i like about this game is that it's team based and in order to survive and complete the objectives is that you have to use teamwork and use tactics, It requires a lot of Skill in order to get good at the game but once you manage to get good at the game, You'll have hours of fun. From the gameplay and feel of the game it's simply just a Classic and will never be forgotten.This game is a good start if you are new to Counter-Strike and would like to buy Counter-Strike!Gameplay:9/10Graphics:7.5/10Sound:8/10Overall rating:10/10			"

												The best FPS game of all time hands down ! I have been playing this game from the early betas right from the begining ! (I still remember to this day, the character's legs weren't moving, it was on cs_siege) This was back in late 1999 or early 2000, now its allmost 2017 and I am still playing ! That is 17 years. This game has stood the test of time. Modern games are spurring like mushrooms with advanced graphics and whatnot, but none of them can give you the experience that this game can give you. I can sincerely say that there are a total of 2 maybe 3 games in all gaming history that can match this game's gaming experience. All in all I recommend this game to any new players who may come across it, who are looking for an amazing online multiplayer experience, and also a big shoutout for the old-school player as myself, don't stop playing this gem ! I sincerelly fear that it will take a very long time until a masterpiece of a game like this will appear, maybe even never. But who knows ? Untill then start cs 1.6 gl and hf ! :)			"

												Quake was the first game I was ever really addicted to and focused a big portion of my time on for months or years at a time. Counter-Strike was the second - and easily more addicting. There's a reason that I still compare every multi-player shooter experience back to original Counter-Strike, to this day. There's a reason I still compare every server community to this (Counter-Strike servers each had their own community and personality and people truly got to know each other back in the day, compared to these days, where a server is just something you're automatically dumped into and feels like every other server).Despite many iterations, nothing quite plays like the original. It's not hard to see why there are still 10,000 to 60,000 people playing this at any one time on any day, fifteen years after launch and why it is always in the top ten games currently being played on all of Steam.This is where it all started. Without this, there's an entire genre of shooter and multi-player that just vanishes. The original days of Counter-Strike remain the most enjoyable gaming experiences of my entire life. It's unlikely that will ever be trumped.			"

												Counter-Strike was the game that changed everything for me in FPS games, coming from older games like the FPS Game Blood  back in (1997) when I was only 10 years old and Half-Life, Counter-Strike changed everything for me it was litterally the best thing ever.The quality of the game was never about the visuals for me but about the game play and performance and Counter-Strike litterally had it all in my opinion.Even today after so many years, I occasionally come back and play Counter-Strike just because it is one of the greatest Counter-Strike versions flat out, anyone disputing this are most likely people that started playing either Counter-Strike: Source or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive first then tried Counter-Strike but if you played it in the right order there is no disputing this, because this game might frighten most the new generation that has expectations to visual graphics having to have a certain standard before they will even touch it.Counter-Strike is not about the visuals, that is just a bonus, if you want visuals then you probably playing the wrong game, Counter-Strike was never Battlefield nor CoD which probably to many looks visually stunning.If you want quality in a game then Counter-Strike is one of the best games to play and get, hence why I am recommending this game.

												Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game from Valve, the first of the Counter-Strike series.Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.Counter-Strike is a good game. I recommend this game.Rating 8/10			"

												Game is really good. I like it because of the genre of the game.I will do some pros and cons for the gamePROS-This game is really old (15 years now), and people still buy it and play it-The game has over 3500 dedicated servers-The community is really big for the game this old-There are really good welcoming server admins-The game has good graphics even for the 15 year old game-It's fun to playCONS-Some server admins are kicking people because of their high Latency-You have to have really good connection to the internet to play the game as it is meant to be playedI recommed it. I rate it 8/10, would Flashbang my teammate again!!			"

												Now i know what you guys are probably going to say: 'OMG this game sucks the graphics are bad D:' and like 'Pfff this game is old nobody still plays it. well it's not, its a game that's made like 13 years ago so don't expect frosbite engine graphics etc... instead you get the way more epic pixel-ish graphics and really classic sounds, and this game is still active with about 30k to 40k players each day.(That's more then all cod games together)And in my opinion it's a must have game since it's one of the best games ever and you still can install skins etc and it's price is good it's only 10 euro or dollars for this great game.

Counter-Strike:I started playing cs when I noticed jacking off isn't the only activity to do on a computer.Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT.CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair. "

												better than cs:go:- you have spray feature (removed in cs:go)- you have flashlight & nightvision (removed in cs:go)- you have dark maps and/or dark places on a map (removed in cs:go, dark places are pretty bright, this is why there is no more flashlight & nightvision, it destroys the immersion, dark places & dark maps are useful for many aspects ingame (hiding or warcraft server when cloaked or when you want someone to knife) and reminds me of 2002 game bf1942 where dark maps are not really dark lol. VALVE shame on you)- You have character selection (removed in cs:go)- you have no ranking & market feature (added in cs:go, everyone plays cs:go because they think they end up as a rich-♥♥♥♥♥, also on every server there is trade spam in chat and even you get friendrequest spam from traders, also community is not looking at your skill anymore, but at your rank and not every server + singleplayer against bots has rank enabled.) - You have no CoD clone like CS:GOUnlike CS:GO, everyone plays this for fun, not for useless skins, money, rank etc.. also, here you cant waste 600$ for a skin. You can get even new models (which does not only change your weapon texture, but the model) from gamebanana for FREE! You can make your M4 look like the G36C etc.10/10 my fav childhood game			"

												This game is one of best games for me. I recommend this game to all, but i recommend  buying Counter Strike: Conditon Zero and completing the game on hardest difficulty two times. Then play Counter Strike. This is one of old generation games so I wanted to buy This game is one of best games for me. I recommend this game to all, but firstly buy Counter Strike: Conditon Zero and complete game on hardest difficul two times. Then play Counter Strike. This is one of the older games so I wanted to buy it first because i wanted see what it was like before. I played that game, my older brothers played aswell . So when you play this game you have the feeling that you went  back in time and played it. Gameplay has been  perfect for years. The grapichs are  still awsome to me, I play a lot of Black Ops 3 on ps4,  this is way better than that for me. So if you have pasion and love to games first play Counter Strike , trust me you will had a lot of fun.I rate the game10/10.			"

												Counter-Strike is a pretty old game of ""shooter"", which was developed in 1999, and since 2000, supported by Valve. This game immediately caught on millions of players around the world. The game is a confrontation of terrorists and counter-terrorists, representing the forces of good and evil. Objectives of the opposing sides differ depending on the map, in which the battle.And here is my thoughs..This is the most entertaining video game i've ever played since 2007.I think i've played this game like 2000hrs i guess, played only the cracked version in that day...I finally i bought this game and it's worth 10 bucks indeed.I still play CS 1.6 because i had an amazing childhood with it!By that i didn't mean online or with bots but i had lots of LAN-party's in my country and my friends still play it though but theres still Lan-party's sometimes in my country ^^The game is still fun and it never gets boring!I mean todally this game has lots of gamemodes which is ZM/ZE/CSDM/GUNGAME/FURIEN/SURF/DEATHRUN/BASEBUILDER and more and more and more...It's just fantastic! :D10/10Would recommand it!

												Counter-Strike - a series of computer games in the genre of team first-person shooter based on the engine GoldSource, originally appeared as a modification of Half-Life games.You have to compare, so this game I will compare with СS: Source and CS: Global Offensive Pros: 1. Battle PVP.The multiplayer game is fully revealed the potential of the idea of the game.The most interesting part of this is. Under the bot can already tune in, but not in the real players. They can deceive, to negotiate, to use cunning tactics to create unusual ambushes.2. The atmosphere and realism.In all games, Valve is always a great atmosphere and I was impressed.It is evident that the developers have tried to do everything in this game, as in real life.For example, the sounds. Unfortunately, Valve released a patch in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with new sounds and they made a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Minuses: 1. Cheaters.Well, as without these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s? These sons of dogs prevent us from playing. Creators of cheats have always been one step ahead of the creators of the VAC anti-cheat. Valve is trying to improve its anti-cheat and have it turns out.I say that Valve do nothing, not worth it.2.Graphic arts.She was good at Counter-Strike as long as did not come out Source.I'm not picky about graphics, but after 30 minutes I start to hurt your eyes.Yes, and in general, this game proved to all that the graphics in games are not the most important thing.3.Termination of support.All good things always come to an end, and Counter-Strike is not an exception. The game goes more and more players, server empty.More Valve does not release an update for Counter-Strike and does not support it in e-sports. Conclusion: Despite the fact that in this game there are downsides, even if they have, but still this game is legendary.If you ask me, as you Counter-Strike, the fond memories flooding back me, maybe I can cry .Game, which was able to give me a lot of positive emotions..

												-Love to shoot people with real life guns with different names?-Have you ever dreamed to kill terrorists and even be a terrorist?-Love playing the same, universal map over and over just because it's the only map you'll ever know? (*cough* dust2)-Have you a desire to work as a team to complete objectives?-Do you know how to speak Brazilian-Portuguese and Romanian? (Awesome because many servers have players that have Brazilians, Romanians, and many other South American/Eurpoean players)-Love nostalgia?-Love to have fun?-Love getting an extra game with bots in it for free? -Love randomly dying from wallbangs?Great, you've come to the right game. Seriously though, despite the somewhat smaller North American community (Which is still big for the old game it is) it's probably one of the greatest games i've ever come to play, and i've only had it for about a year, and i'm gonna add hundreds of thousands of hours playing this. I don't even have actual friends that play with me yet I can still have fun with this game. From the countless recoil patterns to remember from all the guns, to the extremely friendly community (for the most part) and playing all these classic maps. Yes, of course there's hackers, you'll see a few of them, but they don't ruin the game. Either the server's admin can just ban them or you can just go to a different server, it's not gamebreaking or anything. And besides, if you get this you also get Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, which has bots. Hell, you can even download Zbots for 1.6, and it waypoints for you! Definitely get this game. This game stands the test of time.10/10 Would throw brick-looking grenades at terrorists again.			"

												If you can't get Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, this is great replacement for it. It's not as popular, but it still has a big amount of players. Some servers may be in languages you can't understand, but the game is still very fun and requires a great amount of skill. One of the best first person shooters, that still holds to this day from 1999. Although the game's graphics...aren't really the best. Even then, you can get skins, map textures, etc. to spice the graphics up a little bit. Though to me, graphics don't really matter. Highly recommend this game. 9.5/10			"

												I've been playing this game for 10 years (7 or 8 years on non-steam), and it still amazes me with the fact that people are still playing this game. Met bunch of amazing people, learned english more than what school has taught me, joined and left great community every now and then; this game has a huge impact on my life, from personality to the way I see the world (not exaggerating).Some people claimed they have slept with my family, some claimed they are not a hacker (while their crosshair moves furiously, claiming it was an earthquake), some other claimed they can play better if their ping was lower and some other claimed they have tracked my IP and are on the way to kill me. What a super friendly community.Best multiplayer fps game in the history of mankind, never gets me bored with tons of user-made mod, and one thing that this game never cease to amaze me is the fact that this game has a better hitbox than CS:GO (come at me CS:GO plebs)1.6/Counter-Strike, would get rekt by a player playing in the earthquake again			"

I was in Spanish one day and I was startled as I was daydreaming of CS and I told the teacher I slept with her mother in Spanish. Turns out she's dead. This is the game that coined the term ""I am autistic and want to kill myself"".10/10 would fire in the hole again.			"

You get that awesome freedom of movement which you cannot get on CS:S (as much) and on CS:GO. In addition, this game nearly runs on all pc's even potato's with wires. It has a large modding team behind it (AMXX), which isn't affiliated with Valve but nevertheless it makes the game 100x better, and adds amazing mods to it.			"

												Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter game from Valve, the first of the Counter-Strike series.Play the world's number 1 online action game. Engage in an incredibly realistic brand of terrorist warfare in this wildly popular team-based game. Ally with teammates to complete strategic missions. Take out enemy sites. Rescue hostages. Your role affects your team's success. Your team's success affects your role.Counter-Strike is a round based game where you play as counter terrorist or play as terrorist. As a counter terrorist, your task is to prevent the terrorist from planting a bomb and detonate it or rescue a captured hostages and lead them to the hostage rescue zone, while the terrorist team has to do the opposite. Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.			"

												Yeah... the old Counter-Strike.... Everybody know, what CS is..Counter-Strike - My rating - 9/10 Why or Why not to play this old classic ?Positive:It´s a legendary game, and if u playing games like CS:GO etc. u will like it, cause it will be legendary in your library.Almost everybody played CS 1.6 ""from start his cs:go career""Counter-Strike 1.6 is latest and best version on the game, and if u purchase CS, u can play it, if u will download it, there´s is some chance, that u cant play it (Win 8 etc). Most of legens/pro´s in CS:GO played CS 1.6, it´s like beginning, and it could be your beginning! Negative:No more good tournaments on CS 1.6 (On CS:GO are tournaments like EMS, Dreamhack etc.)Graphic+Gameplay - Graphic sucks... but its still better then WarZ:PGameplay.... yeah, crouching sucks, aiming sucks... u know... bad gameplay, if u see CS:GO, when is all so smooth, u will hate CS 1.6... but if u play CS 1.6 before then CS:GO, its good for you, and u will like it (probably:D)So... my opinion is:It´s legendary game, everyone, who likes FPS must have this in his/her:P steam library. :) "

												Counter-Strike is a pretty old game of ""shooter"", which was developed in 1999, and since 2000, supported by Valve. This game immediately caught on millions of players around the world. The game is a confrontation of terrorists and counter-terrorists, representing the forces of good and evil. Objectives of the opposing sides differ depending on the map, in which the battle.And here is my thoughs...This is the most entertaining video game i've ever played since 2007.I think i've played this game like 2000hrs i guess, played only the cracked version in that day...I finally i bought this game and it's worth 10 bucks indeed.I still play CS 1.6 because i had an amazing childhood with it!By that i didn't mean online or with bots but i had lots of LAN-party's in my country and my friends still play it though but theres still Lan-party's sometimes in my country ^^The game is still fun and it never gets boring!I mean todally this game has lots of gamemodes which is ZM/ZE/CSDM/GUNGAME/FURIEN/SURF/DEATHRUN/BASEBUILDER/MIX/PCW/CM/AUTOMIX/BRUSH/ARUSH and more and more and more...It's just fantastic! :D10/10Would recommand it!

												Counter-Strike was an amazing achievement. A free mod for the original Half-Life that outshone it's parent game completely and become becoming incredibly popular, so popular in fact, that it was sold it stores as a individual entity back when it was still free to download for anyone that already owned Half-Life.Nowadays a mod turning into a full game is almost common place and happens sometimes even without the popularity but back then, it was a monumental accomplishment. Counter-Strike managed to become the most played PC shooter of all time and even to this day boasts both a strong competitive scene and tons of active public servers. How many other online shooters can say that their online community is still alive and kicking 12 years down the line?The game itself I never really cared much for, I played it back in the 5.2 beta days and although there is something to admire about the simplistic purity of it's gameplay this has never been the kind of game I could really get stuck into.The developers tried to introduce a number of new game-modes back in the beta days but quickly found that trying to complicate the game would only leave the players confused and unsure of how to proceed.Counter-Strike is a simplistic teamshooter but it is a milestone in gaming history and one that we should be happy and proud of because Counter-Strike's simple existence is the reason why modding turned mainstream.

There are many things tod if you get bored of the tactical playing in games. You can bhop, deathrun, surf and a lot of other things. This honestly should be a $60 game for how good it actually is.

												One of the classics of the shooting genre and precursor to most of today's modern shooters, for all the good and the bad that may imply. Counter-Strike 1.6 is the second iteration of the original Half-Life mod and, quite likely, its most popular incarnation. The rather simplistic gameplay coupled with accessible system requirements and intuitive controls make it one of the most long-lived shooters today, still sporting a massive fanbase.A game that must be tried at least once by any shooting game neophyte.

												Counter-Strike is probably one of the if not the best fps series ever, and it all started from this humble beginning, Counter -Strike 1.6 is a down right one of the greatest classics. It still holds up today, thousands of people play it EVERYDAY, this community has not weakend from 1999 it has gotten stronger, and it is 2014! The competitiveness and skillfulness of CS is so much fun, and no other game can even capture a mere smidge of it. This game also still has competitive servers still today, unlike the newer CS:source which just have casual servers that are only on office and Dust 2. On 1.6 you can find nearly every map (including moded maps), and nearly every game mode (even moded game modes). CS 1.6 still holds up today and it is still so much fun, I give 1.6 a 10 out of 10.

												Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.			"

												This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist. I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.			"

I started playing this game after I remember the difficulty and skill needed to handle the aiming in this game and honestly after all these years this game is still amazing, if you get the ""These graphics are ♥♥♥♥"" mindset and focus on the gameplay it's amazing. It's fast-paced and some of the modded maps are insanely detailed. Amazing game with amazing replay value.			"

												Не думаю что про CS можно много сказать, хотя нужно ли вообще много говрить? Это моя первая онайн игра.Играл я тогда не на лицензии. Графика мне до сих пор приятна. В ней нравится все, собенно карты , как же я обожаю эти стрые карты. Хотел бы я их увидеть в GO , наверное. Лана, думаю и так понятно что тут 10/10.Вобщее не думаю что стоит писать обзор , вряд ли кто-то не знает про эту игру. Только если он не вышел из бункера. Хех...Спасибо что прочли. Удачи вам!			"

												There's been a lot said about this game already, so...I'll say some more anyway, both about this entry and about the entire series.Counter-Strike was created as a modification for Half-Life and quickly took on a life of its own, eventually meriting a standalone release by Valve. Its development process more or less invented the concept of the public beta. At one point around its public release, Internet traffic for the original surpassed the entire traffic output of Italy. The game itself across all its iterations can be described as easy to learn yet hard to master, like so many good games. Unlike chess and go however, CS primarily revolves around shooting people.On the surface, it's simple. Counter-terrorists must stop terrorists from planting a bomb at a strategic location, or rescue hostages that the terrorists are holding. There's a handful of other modes included with the original, but they're almost never played. Players earn money over each round (more for winning and killing) to purchase more suitable guns and equipment.In practice, rounds can sometimes end with one team being killed before any objectives can be seen to. Apart from a couple of series quirks that people have learned to love - or exploit, if they're Actual Pro Gamers™ - CS is pretty realistic. One shot, one kill and all of that. (No real story either, either explicit or in subtext.)One thing CS has going for it that I haven't seen mentioned much is that you can play in bite-sized chunks if you want to. As far as I know, the reasons for it not being mentioned much are that the latest game (Global Offensive) has a competitive mode that encourages playing for entire matches, and that more dedicated players will often play for hours. Strictly speaking, I recommend playing in chunks: CS can get tense and difficult depending on your skill and the skill of your opposition.However, the pacing is such that it's not exactly the hyperactive bulletfest most of today's shooters are: matches can end up as deadly games of cat and mouse as often as they erupt into firefights. Related is the fact that there is no prestige (apart from matchmaking rankings in Global Offensive) or killstreaks or what have you for players to literally level the playing field with. It can be frustrating to miss an opponent's head by a hair only for them to not miss in turn, or to be oneshotted out of the blue, but it's reassuring to know that skill is the primary factor here.Another interesting thing is the individualism you usually see on display. Most players, especially Real Pro Gamers™, place a high emphasis on very skilled aiming, but a well-coordinated team that knows how to position themselves on a given map will generally have a big advantage against a team of lone wolf headshotters. CS doesn't exactly encourage team play or punish a lack of it like Insurgency, but I will. (Encourage it, not punish the lack of it. (Much.))This particular entry in the series still holds up; its aesthetic is more classic than dated, and you get the no-frills base gameplay that made the series what it is. If you're looking to get into the series I would still recommend Source or the cheaper, more modern (albeit probably more toxic) Global Offensive over this, but that's more a matter of preference and polish.The main advantage this first entry has over the rest of its series is that you can play it on pretty much any computer these days, although Source is only a little more punishing on today's computers. There's a fair amount of mediocre (if somewhat classic) maps and no default bot support, but unlike the beautified expansion-slash-sequel Condition Zero, you'll still find a lot of people in multiplayer; even more than in Source!Please avoid Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies though. It may be based off this game, but it is bad.			"

												Well, here it is. Some call it ""the mother of shooters"", some call it ""bullsh*t"". Well, I can´t tell, whether you will like it, but the fact is, that it started one of the first big shooter franchises ever. Pros:-awesome gameplay-awesome gunplay-nostalgia-teambased-mechanicsCons:-a bit outdated thoughI myself like the classic Counter Strike, but I think there should be big Skillbased MatchMaking Sites like FaceIt or ESEA (if possible even free ones), because the Competetive Mode from Global Offensive is pretty good (even though sometimes it sucks with its rank system). I think, that it is a great game, but perhaps some players will be put off by the old graphics, but these are pretty good, if you imagine, that this game is about 16 years old.

												Best hours I spent in my life (arguably <_<), even after so many years I'm still learning... That's ok because that's what make Counter Srike trully special, the learning curve is so steep that you'll never get bored, if you're up for the challenge of course... This game is the true tactical FPS multiplayer, many new games with fancy graphics try to accomplish what CS 1.6 did and fail terribly.1.6 needs more love from valve, it was one of the games that made steam a 'thing', hell, back in the day it was the ONLY game to bring loyal users to the platform, the games available at the time were very reduced and steam was just an annoyance, to be completely honest we all hated steam, it was a broken nightmare. Valve could show some love for their baby... adding trading cards, bg's and emo's or even skins would be a great start... one call only dream.. :)tl;dr: Steam was very broken and the 1.6 playerbase kept it going, valve should recognize that.

Once you play this game, you will never get bored of it, even if you were unskilled in classic mods, there will always be a good and funny mod that will suits you.Still haven't bought this game? Go get it! Fully recommended - 10/10!			"

												Recommended. Here is the pros/cons of this game in my humble opinion: PROS	 + Nostalgic+ Buy menu shortcuts+ You can buy bullets as much as you like+ Some unique server mods like Warcraft+ Some unique original maps which don't included later versions of CS (even they are not so great)+ Active community CONS	 - Literally ****ed up server list, probably server owners do that (fake ping/fake player counts etc.)- Except buy menu shortcuts, buy menu isn't so useful (especially if you hit ESC to close the menu, it doesn't works)- Weird hitpoints and lucky headshots- 7/24 ""de_dust2"", ""de_inferno"" playing community			"

												El mejor juego de shooter en la historia, en su tiempo, eran los mejores graficos, lanzado el 18 de junio de 1999, en sus antiguas versiones, finalmente el 1 de noviembre del 2000, se lanzó el juego que cambió la historia, Counter-Strike.El juego se fue arreglando por parte de Valve, el juego estaba rotisimo, disparar saltando, corriendo, etc.Trae demasiados modos, Zombie Escape, Surf, Deathmatch, y miles de modos más que te traerán muchas horas de juego.Lo malo que ya Counter-Strike ya no se juega en las competiciones, lo que ahora lo hace el Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, nadie se quería mudar en ese tiempo a ese juego, a nadie le gustaba, y por eso Valve, tuvo que sacar Counter-Strike de las competiciones, para obligar que los jugadores se pasaran a Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.+ GRAN Cantidad de mapas (comunidad)+ Jugadores + Jugabilidad+ Adictivo y divertido.+ Multijugador.- Sistema VAC apesta.- Demasiados bugs.¿Quieres un juego donde pasaras miles de horas y baratisimo? Tienes que comprarlo. :)			"

												Standard run and gun game that says it tries to stop cheaters and hackers out of the game, instead all it does is ban people who are having internet trouble trying to blame them for lag switching. It does not hitting those who you can obviously watch and see they are using aim bots by spectating after death and always aiming at people through walls at their heads ready to shoot the moment they turn corners.

I love this game and its game series! It taught me tactical gameplay and how much communication is key but this game lacks a bit of that but not much.

												Counter - Strike - одна из немногих культовых игровых серий типа ”shooter”, предлагающая игроку довольно простой и динамичный геймплей. Но это только на первый взгляд – на самом деле CS состоит из огромного количества важных макро- и микроэлементов: экономика, стратегия, точность, командная игра и так далее. Данный проект впервые появился на свет в виде модификации к Half – Life. Основная серия состоит из 5 игр, причем последняя из их числа стала самой популярной и запоминающейся - Counter-Strike 1.6. Кроме этого, имеются и отдельные части, вышедшие после финальной версии 1.6: Counter-Strike: Condition Zero (включая Deleted Scenes - сюжетная одиночная кампания), созданные на GoldSource, а также CS: Source, CS: Global Offensive. Последняя часть вышла в 2012 году, 21 августа.Принцип игрыИгровой процесс представляет собой командный режим - существует 2 команды: спецназ и террористы. У каждой есть свои специфические задачи во время каждого раунда, в зависимости от выбранного типа игры. Самые популярные карты – сценарий с закладкой бомбы. Помимо этого существуют операции со спасением заложников или VIP’а. Но, так или иначе, победу можно одержать довольно простым и понятным способом - уничтожить вражескую команду. По результатам каждого раунда обоим сторонам выдаются внутри игровые деньги, победившим - больше, а проигравшим соответственно меньше. С их помощью можно приобрести более качественную экипировку и оружие, помогающие одержать верх в следующей схватке.			"

												Few years ago, we first heard that CS 1.6 is dead, some organizations have dismissed their CS - team, people screaming that the game is dead and we need to move to CS: GO. It seems that now it is not so! If you pay attention to the broadcast with IEM 6 WC, we see that CS 1.6 By Views prevzashla SC 2, not only is this game broke all past their records. So why CS 1.6 is dead? I beg to differ. According to spectators IEM 6 CS was the best in the tournament. I think CS 1.6 hardly died, she would die only if we want to do! As for CS: GO it grows, developers even began to read the ""Feedback"", the game has changed a lot of things. Open Beta -version of the game was to be released after the new year, but I think the developers have not yet sufficiently satisfied with the result. As for the keys to the CS: GO, something I'm working on that would get a couple of the key for you guys! I will write how I succeed!			"

												Can shoot terrorists and be terrorist. Can plant bomb as terrorist.Counter-Strike predicting ISIS before it even existed confirmed? More updates as they come.UPDATE: Valve has replied to my message, and only said ""Never email us again or we will ban your Steam account"". Yes. So I wondered, what if I ran this through my decoder machine? So I ran it through my decoder machine. And it came out as this lonely message: Trump did 7/11.What could it mean? I'm not really sure. I'll keep you guys posted.UPDATE #2: I've done extensive research, and it appears that this decoded message either means that Donald J. Trump owns a large chain of convenience stores, or that he is an international terrorist threat. At this point I'm not entirely sure which it is. If you have insight into this topic, please reach me at xXilluminartyboizXx@internetexplorer.com. Thanks.UPDATE #3: This might be my final update. I found a note slipped into my underwear when I woke up this morning. It was adressed from Valve. I opened it, naturally. Inside was one, simple sentence: Trump sees all. Guys, listen, I don't know for sure if Trump did 7/11, or he made ISIS, or anything, but it's been fun trying to figure it out. If I don't make it to another update, and they get to me first, just tell my hamster Poochins that I loved him. Peace out.			"

												There can't be better than 1.6 throughout all these years playing it since I didn't even know what's steam.Buying the original game feels way better than non-steam no lag experience as some of you say.It's hella worth the time spent it's been almost 7 years for me playing this game since I was a kid. My childhood and maybe later would be my adulthood also being spent on it. The amount of mods/servers are unbelievable! all of them are amazing as I tried them all. I can't deny that I am addicted to it but, yet! It's hella worth to re-born and be played like the past times! Tournaments and more. I can't withstand the ignorance of valve to it's amazing old games!Just remember that before cs go came out, your success was not in CS:S or CS:CZ it was all in this game. <3			"

Weapons has hard recoil so you can't just spray and pray, short burst fire can save you in critical situation. Before the round begins, you can and need to buy weapons and equipments with money, you get money by winning the round or killing the enemy team. This type of gameplay encourages team work.Counter-Strike is a good game. I recommend this game.Thanks Valve Thanks !!! Old but Gold !!!10/10 From MeSweepPlaying this game since 2004			"

												The classic action FPS: Counter-Strike, has made a huge impact on my gaming life, ever since I was a pre-pubscent,6 year old child. Enjoying various betas and versions throughout it's development, the game has evolved from a mod for Half-Life, to one of the most viewed and played eSports. If you haven't already, buy it,play it and enjoy it. I have nailed countless of hours on different accounts I've had, and of course the non-steam versions10/10			"

												There can't be better than 1.6 throughout all these years playing it since I didn't even know what's steam.Buying the original game feels way better than non-steam no lag experience as some of you say.It's hella worth the time spent it's been almost 7 years for me playing this game since I was a kid. My childhood and maybe later would be my adulthood also being spent on it. The amount of mods/servers are unbelievable! all of them are amazing as I tried them all. I can't deny that I am addicted to it but, yet! It's hella worth to re-born and be played like the past times! Tournaments and more. I can't withstand the ignorance of valve to it's amazing old games!Just remember that before cs go came out, your success was not in CS:S or CS:CZ it was all in this game. <3			"

												This game STILL continue to live on, but why was that? Well it was quite due to that fact that CS:Source isn't that much like by the pros since 2004 as CS:S as quoted: ""Too easy"" and such, so the match for cs 1.6 grew more and more and that it was so hyped and praised and good, it still have matches even after 10 years of its 1.6 release (2003 - 2013) in which just kind of died out for CS:GO, but still, because of it's core gameplay and the fact that the commuity has been long just playing this multiplayer long and long and long, it is a game that will take long to die out, since it has a strong community base for it.Since this game has been, well for long, then you should commonly see the use of wallhacking, cheats, aimbot, fake servers been used today, and the fact that there are quite a lot of empty servers now, but there are populated servers that are good and good community, but there are part of the community been off ever since.It is seem a bit late to just buy and play this game, but it is still great to check it out if you are new to the cs series, or otherwise if you don't have GNU/Linux (In which I have), then you can buy Counter Strike : Globle Offensive anyway, since it is newer and (I think) has more players and pros playing it now. But if you want to have this raw action, then cs 1.6/cz would be great, you can get the bundle too if you want source as well, but source is fun to play as well.Verdict: 9.5/10 - It still holds it place.

												I'll remind you: I've played CS 1.6 into oblivion on another account. 101 hours is not the full representation of my gameplay in this game. CS 1.6 is a classic game everybody almost knows what is, at least if you are an FPS player. Of course today it is very outdated and not something you would otherwise play as your main game, but it certainly is something to take a walk through every once in a while - especially as a trip down memory lane or as a fun little LAN game to take your mind off modern games, which can get tiresome after a while (at least in my honest opinion.) I can definitely recommend this. I played it a lot, and all the while, despite my review of it, CS:CZ had an end consensus that was a better smooth gameplay somewhat, this is one of the best games of all time. At least in terms of the FPS genre. No doubt. But if you were to play it today, you'd have to be patient as the only people still playing this online are either veterans, somewhat experienced people or cheaters (on VAC-insecure servers which there also is quite a lot of.) If you're lucky, you might still find that some of the best servers that kept the community going might still be up. Maybe. Tread carefully, but definitely try it.			"

												I was sitting in CT Spawn in de_dust2 after I found my entire team afk sitting right next to me. I decided to sneak up on cat when I heard ""Bomb has been planted"" by the terrorist opposition. I proceeded to act like a Slick Ninja by avoiding all terrorists. Only to find out most of them went to look for our team and killed them in ct spawn. I went around on Cat Walk, Threw a smoke, and went to cut the wire of the bomb the Terrorists had planted. I almost cut the Blue wire, and it could have cost us the round. 5 Seconds goes by, and it says, ""Counter Terrorist wins"". At that very moment, I just realized I had won the game.That is my story.

												The greatest multiplayer shooter experience I've had since Quake 1. The e-sport scene also helped it alot, it's the only computer game I've really followed when it comes to e-sports (back when I followed the CPL etc). The design of the game was simple but very effective and delivered a multiplayer experience that few other games can match. The Call of Duty and Battlefield titles, although good in their own right, never drew me in like Counter-Strike.			"

												Bought this game a bit too late... wish I would've been around to play it back in it's prime.This game is simply a classic. My first Counter-Strike was Source. I loved Source a lot, and that lead to me getting CS:GO. CS:GO is now my most played game. ANYWAYS, I bought this game pretty recently and I love playing it. Too bad the servers are bugged I think, otherwise, still has an alright community. great gameplay and requires a lot of skill.I love the wallbanging and the style you have to shoot. Not so much run n gun like the other games in the series.I definitely recommend this game. Even though I doubt many people are still buying this game!			"

												This game changed gaming as a whole. One of the best FPS of all time, if not the best. But its all about the gameplay. Its how CS plays that will get you. Huge online community, thousands of mods, nostalgic graphics, excellent gameplay, nice sound effects even if they r outdated. CS 1.6 is my favorite FPS and is much better than Global Offensive in all aspects. I played this game so much before i got Steam, this game is just spetacular. Even in non-steam gaming, lan houses,competitive play, CS 1.6 is still incredibly popular. 10/10, congratulations to the developers.			"

												This game, is not a multiplayer game, is THE Multiplayer Game. This game is classic, is a monster! Counter-Strike... I love those words. This is my 2 favorite game of all time. To be good in this game you must be a strategist, to have a good team relationship, and takes dedication. This game has tons of weapons to choose. THe game modes are PERFECT, the other community gamemodes are even better! You like COD with zombies, well, this game haved zombies before COD, and better zombies. In what game are you gonna do a deathrun, where you must be alert to everything and to have skills to survive and kill a terrorist? In what game are you gonna kill zombies, while they run at full speed and all your teammates throw granades and shoot as if there was no tommorow? In what game are you gonna surf on wall? In what game are you gonna find this quantity of maps, and good maps!? In what game!? Battlefield and COD can have better graphics, destruction, campaing and more guns, but, they will never have the community that Counter-Strike have. We made Counter-Strike, Counter-Strike made us.(English is not my first language)			"

It is shameful that this game is not played. This game made and broke friendships and made a childhood for many people. Even if you dont play the game often. Please just get it for it to be in your library. 8/10 for some bugs and a now strange community. But nonetheless a great game.			"

												We will never forget about 1.6 ,  at its time this game was not only a game , it was a sport , a purpose , a way of living , i've been playing this since the beginning(back in 1999 or 2000 can't remember for sure :D) and i don't know what the world of gaming would have been today without it , so Counter Strike will always remain the king :D			"

												This is not a game. This is a life.I'm so sorry that there are too much cheaters on servers, but if Valve can make it better , it would be great :D Remember old good times, waiting to start a new match between Na'Vi and fNatic <3 And all other teams... Then somebody made a cheat, and destroyed a game. This game changed many lives, many people. I think this game become the world best game ever. For me, it's the best game. I play it every day, but it isn't like sometimes. Now graphic is important. Well, it isn't. I know that this game is dead already... I want to get it back, but there is no way to do that.Cheaters are everywhere now. In every single game. You can buy cheat for CS:GO for 5$ I think... My friend bought it. I asked him : "" Why did you bought that ? Isn't it better to enjoy playing the game without cheats? "" He told me: "" I want to beat everyone. I want to be the best. No one can stop me now. ""I don't know why are you doing it, this is beautiful game. When I played it for the first time, it was awesome :D Finally a game that I can play with my friends on LAN. And, till today, I'm playing it. I never downloaded a cheat. I don't need that. I want to learn how to play, to be the beast in the world... Now everyone is wanting money, money money... I heard about CS:GO Lounge aka CS GO betting site. Now everyone is watching matches because of skins, to get free money... Well, when I was young, in 2005. I waited with my friends a CS 1.6 match. It was beautiful. Now i sit here, and watch this CS:GO matches... So many people watch matches... But 90% watch them because of f***ing bet...It will never be like sometimes... Or we can change everything...Valve please, get this game back to life <3Thanks.			"

												This game changed gaming as a whole. One of the best FPS of all time, if not the best. But its all about the gameplay. Its how CS plays that will get you. Huge online community, thousands of mods, nostalgic graphics, excellent gameplay, nice sound effects even if they r outdated. CS 1.6 is my favorite FPS and is much better than Global Offensive in all aspects. I played this game so much before i got Steam, this game is just spetacular. Even in non-steam gaming, lan houses,competitive play, CS 1.6 is still incredibly popular. 10/10, congratulations to the developers.			"

												This game STILL continue to live on, but why was that? Well it was quite due to that fact that CS:Source isn't that much like by the pros since 2004 as CS:S as quoted: ""Too easy"" and such, so the match for cs 1.6 grew more and more and that it was so hyped and praised and good, it still have matches even after 10 years of its 1.6 release (2003 - 2013) in which just kind of died out for CS:GO, but still, because of it's core gameplay and the fact that the commuity has been long just playing this multiplayer long and long and long, it is a game that will take long to die out, since it has a strong community base for it.Since this game has been, well for long, then you should commonly see the use of wallhacking, cheats, aimbot, fake servers been used today, and the fact that there are quite a lot of empty servers now, but there are populated servers that are good and good community, but there are part of the community been off ever since.It is seem a bit late to just buy and play this game, but it is still great to check it out if you are new to the cs series, or otherwise if you don't have GNU/Linux (In which I have), then you can buy Counter Strike : Globle Offensive anyway, since it is newer and (I think) has more players and pros playing it now. But if you want to have this raw action, then cs 1.6/cz would be great, you can get the bundle too if you want source as well, but source is fun to play as well.Verdict: 9.5/10 - It still holds it place.

												Jedná se o souboj dvou týmů – protiteroristické jednotky (dále jen CT – z angl. counter‑terrorist) a teroristů (dále jen T – z angl. terrorist).Hráči na konci každého kola získávají podle osobního a týmového výkonu peníze (za zabití nepřítele, splnění úkolu, ale i za prohru), které využívají k nákupu zbraní a vybavení. Přičemž maximální částka na kontě jednoho hráče je většinou 16 000 $. Zabití spoluhráčů či rukojmích vede k peněžnímu trestu. Na začátku hry mají hráči 800 $ a další peníze získávají zabíjením nepřátel vyhráváním kola atd. .			"

												The original CS.This is where it all started, 1.6. While many forget about 1.4, 1.5 and those versions, 1.6 is a great standalone title.Graphics wise, you have to be able to run this. If you can't run CS at all, not sure why you have Steam. Simple, and basic is what a lot of people would describe the look and feel of CS to be.If you haven't played HL original it make look a little stupid, but the game is still great inside. Original can't get more original here -- when talking about the base game idea(s).Great for people with low end comps and internet like Link Freeman and his dial up. This game was made a while back so keep that in mind!7/10			"

												Counter-Strike:I started playing cs when I was just 4 years old .Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT.CS is one of the greatest and undermined games in history. It is, in my opinion, the best game to ever have a crosshair.'Very Addictive Game :p			"

												The original CS.This is where it all started, 1.6. While many forget about 1.4, 1.5 and those versions, 1.6 is a great standalone title.Graphics wise, you have to be able to run this. If you can't run CS at all, not sure why you have Steam. Simple, and basic is what a lot of people would describe the look and feel of CS to be.If you haven't played HL original it make look a little stupid, but the game is still great inside. Original can't get more original here -- when talking about the base game idea(s).Great for people with low end comps and internet like Link Freeman and his dial up. This game was made a while back so keep that in mind!7/10			"

												RECOMMENDED JUST FOR NOSTALGIA, besides that, NOT RECOMMENDED!It's the father to the modern Counter Strikes and FPS in general. That's a fact, but that doesn't mean you should play this. We have CSGO now, it would be ridiculous to pick up a old, outdated and dying game like CS 1.6. Those who play it do so cause they've been doing it for 15+ years, but no new players arrive and it is too much blocky graphically to be even considered for purchase these days.Great game, but too old/outdated and dying. Don't recommend, unless you're here to get some nostalgia from the old days. (I still give it thumbs up cause it's still a GREAT game and we can't publish a analysis thinking on the time we are but on the time the game was made, to compare it to it's days instead of current days)			"

												Counter-Strike was one of the first video games I have ever played and will always be up there in my list of favorite games.I had just installed it. It was my first multiplayer game and I though I'm too new to play against players so I played only with bots slowly progressing from easy to to the hard ones. Then one day I joined a Dust II DM server. It was chaotic, but fun. I didn't even know the map then, but I learned it by playing lots of DM. I slowly climbed the integrated server ranks and made friends with one of the admins...then after a while the server disappeared.After that I found out about deathrun. I was horrible at it, but the regulars helped me and I started visiting the server more and more. Apparently the same server chain had a gun game server too. Now that was amazing. Completely different people played there, but again friendly ones. After a couple of months the server chain was shut down...I continued playing aim, awp, jailbreak and other mods. I didn't even play the classic mode, it wasn't of that big interest to me, though after a couple of months I stopped playing CS.I can't not recommend this game, because I have so many memories from it.

												Been playing CS since 2003. Despite what the box on tactical ops says no really it's not better than counter strike. CS is the best first person shooter in my opinion. The reason 1.6 is better than GO or Source is because it's about player skill not graphics. The hit boxes are much better. In order to be a great player you need to know how to execute movement even bunny hop. Best game ever.			"

												This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:I remember back in 2010 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2012. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist. I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.			"

												this game is juste, simply, clearly perfect, no game could ever get any close to it, i have CS:GO and yet i enjoy a lot more cs 1.6 then CS:GOgood points:- a classic but amazing gameplay suited for thousands and thousands of fun playing- a load of modifications and moded servers with a multitude of skins for best looking game possible (like Zm mod,ZE or BaseBuilder....)- low requirements for it, but yet it allows to play with soooo many people on internet on many servers, as anybody could run this game- very amazing low download size making it pretty much portable (400~Mb of download is still much less then other games)- and ofc, the nice spent hours with friends killing each others as well as working together (RIP to old friendships broken by this game too :P)- diversity of communities to enjoy a sociable envirement and getting new friendsBad points:- graphisme are not good for those who are getting used to nowadays games (some people might overcome this point by simply loving the simplicity of the game)- presence of annoying cheaters on servers and the small management of such problems- no single player mode and even if you fight bots, its not fun.i think thats all for my review, i've been playing this game for like 4 years now and i still freaking enjoy it and i really recommand it to anyone with powerfull and low pc, it creates unbreakable friendship relations :v			"

												Это одна из немногих игр,которая не нуждается в представлении. Counter-Strike 1.6 это классика сетевых игр. Это то,из за чего еще в школе сбегали с уроков,чтобы часок поиграть в компьютерном клубе с друзьями. CS 1.6 была,есть и будет лучшей сетевой стрелялкой.			"

Lots of people say this game hasn't aged well, and in some ways that is true, but really, this is one of the games that changed the gaming industry.			"

												Counter-Strike has come a long way and to see this game really brings out how much it has come. I feel as this game is not just a time waster but a reason to still be on the Internet. But In 1999, I crawled out of Counter-Strike’s wretched ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to become the man I am today. And, now, I’m tasked with rating the game. How does one even rate his mother?In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class. Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS (nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept!) It was more than a game. It was my social hub, my iTunes visualizer, and my brief entryway into game design (which didn’t go very far.) It is and remains a standout multiplayer shooter that paved the way for things to come with Call of Duty and Battlefield.Being eight years since the excellent Source remake, Valve has decided it’s time to give the game another facelift. What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive, it is without a doubt a reboot. Valve has just hit the reset button on the series, once again. As drastic and premature of a maneuver it may be, there is no denying that Counter-Strike remains an addictive and rewarding competitive shooter like no other.In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class.

												This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:I remember back in 2010 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2012. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist. I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.			"

Awhh what can I say about this master piece? well, It's one of the best first-person shooters that have ever been made, still today you can find tons of peeople playing online!Don't be fooled by how many ours I've got playing this game on steam, I've played since early 2004, this game is practicaly my childhood. LOLYou cannot compare this game to CS:GO, with modern graphics and ♥♥♥♥, yet both of them are incredible on its way.I love the fact that you don't have scope blur when you walk, the fact that M4A1 and USP have enough bullets.

												Let this be a message to valve but since they just won't or don't care, it is for people to read and having an favorite of mine exemplified. Their modern game in the series of counter-strike is global offensive what is a more succesful product in terms of finances. It's a lot easier when your income generates at a steady rate by gullible consumers or underaged youngsters but that's all their current game is about frankly and competitive scene is making a good marketing baseline for promoting so. CS 1.6 or Source in that matter of fact is everything better than ""THAT"" making it increasingly more bland by next coming update which add the next layer of cosmetics or rather less useful update. The reply that would come from someone who has no problem with the idea would say you shouldn't buy into it. There is a problem however, when a company does a thing such as this it's their driving force behind their current product (mostly doing well in most cases) would have implications for builiding on this structure and not really caring about what it is about their game. Hard working months upon years can be spend just learning how the gold source engine works in 1.6 and learning from your friend who will guide you in a custom server as your mentor/teacher to pick up valuable information on how to handle the game. Above all which is likely my strongest point is because it is actually fun to play without having to care about stats plus the other issues. Having such a love for the half-life serie my heart sores. People made amazing mods, mods that came from HL1 that were made into whole separate games or idealogical advancements is staggering. I urge you to know what does matter to you valve, that what made your previous games great. - your dear questionable fan			"

												Pretty old game, but still better then most of newer games ... at least for me.. I was playing CS 1.6 seven years and i'm still not bored from this game... It has some nice feeling in itself ... I  would've recommend  this game to everyone who loves shooters.. Still has enough of players :). + Good player community+ You can create/download your own models (weapons,characters...) and spray logo+ Lots of playable servers+ Sometimes you can see also very funny bugs :D  "

												A beacon of online gaming, that despite being a dated title, so many players come back to it because of the well defined game mechanic. There's no great depth of content, just a simple yet enjoyable platform for team deathmatch with map objectives thrown in. Years ago I spent atleast 1,000 enjoyable hours playing it.			"

												Let this be a message to valve but since they just won't or don't care, it is for people to read and having an favorite of mine exemplified. Their modern game in the series of counter-strike is global offensive what is a more succesful product in terms of finances. It's a lot easier when your income generates at a steady rate by gullible consumers or underaged youngsters but that's all their current game is about frankly and competitive scene is making a good marketing baseline for promoting so. CS 1.6 or Source in that matter of fact is everything better than ""THAT"" making it increasingly more bland by next coming update which add the next layer of cosmetics or rather less useful update. The reply that would come from someone who has no problem with the idea would say you shouldn't buy into it. There is a problem however, when a company does a thing such as this it's their driving force behind their current product (mostly doing well in most cases) would have implications for builiding on this structure and not really caring about what it is about their game. Hard working months upon years can be spend just learning how the gold source engine works in 1.6 and learning from your friend who will guide you in a custom server as your mentor/teacher to pick up valuable information on how to handle the game. Above all which is likely my strongest point is because it is actually fun to play without having to care about stats plus the other issues. Having such a love for the half-life serie my heart sores. People made amazing mods, mods that came from HL1 that were made into whole separate games or idealogical advancements is staggering. I urge you to know what does matter to you valve, that what made your previous games great. - your dear questionable fan			"

Then this game is probably for you.For everybody else, us FPS noobs, this is a fun past time with your equally bad friends. Learn how to crouch, how to hide and how to be called a ""stupid, sniping c**t"".Just buy the game already!			"

												The original Counter Strike came out in 1999 and is still good. El Classico. If you can find a chance to play it, I would highly recommend it. Unlike it successors, you can feel and hit crisp shots that just aren't available in latter versions of CS. 10/10 Would recommend.			"

												Counter Strike is by no means a perfect game. Back in the day this game was as good as global offensive. But it painfully does not hold up today. But what makes this game incredible is the community. The community is full of spastics who make any game a very fun time. I highly reccomend this game but I strongly disagree that the game should be $10, so buy it when the price drops.			"

												Classic and yet still the one of the most entertaining FPS-style shooters that has ever set foot on earth. Gameplay mechanics are fun and yet challenging. Game provides many different gamemodes from regular deathmatch-bomb plant mission to platformer style of gamemodes. Overall an awesome game and I recommend it to anyone who has any cs experience or has any interest in FPS-shooters :)			"

												Counter-Strike destroyed my life.  I had been playing HL deathmatch, and was waiting for team fortress 2 (some of those early TF2 screens are still etched in my brain)  I came across a new mod called Counter-Strike, it had just been released, Beta 1 there were only 3 maps I think and the player models were so similar that in the darkend corridors of Mansion you couldn't see who was what, so there was team killing galore, even a console command for extra money, but it was awesome, I'd never played anything like it.  So I played it.  ALLOT.  I'd come in from college stick it on and play untill I was ready for bed, screw school work I had people to shoot in the face!  Anyway I failed my A-levels and got stuck with crappy jobs, but looking back, it could possibly have been worth it, because damn I had fun!  I don't know what its like nowadays, I did get fed up with the bunnyhopping AWP gits and from what I gather that is the way the game went, but this was it, where it started for me, and if you haven't played it once then you should just so you know where all your call of duty and all that balls came from.

												Invaded by ethnicities with bad computers and awful ideas with their server management, it is now impossible as of today to get a decent match without paying for ESEA, even in PUG servers.Not being racist, this is what actually happened.Surf servers and Fun servers finally died around 2011, whilst vanilla servers that ain't running dust 2 all day long died before Steam even came out, and all that's left is a bunch of latino-controlled servers with ♥♥♥♥-awful maps and enough plugins to give you a seizure and a thousand hats.

												If you love the CSGO and want to see what CS is like you will love this game. The gameplay is good. The 2 things that suck about the game is the people that play in 5v5 servers don't speak english and I get kicked not knowing why. And the spray patterns dont have 1 specific pattern to each gun, after the first 5 bullets there are 12 different patterns the bullets can go			"

												A beacon of online gaming, that despite being a dated title, so many players come back to it because of the well defined game mechanic. There's no great depth of content, just a simple yet enjoyable platform for team deathmatch with map objectives thrown in. Years ago I spent atleast 1,000 enjoyable hours playing it.			"

												Good old times when i played this game for the first time. I had 5 years old when i tried this game for the first time. As you know, this game is a modification of Half-Life by developers and it's a multiplayer first-person shooter. You don't have iron sight how you have in CoD or other shooter games + you need to know the weapons because they don't shoot where is the aim. It's hard to explain, but this game has so many modes and is awesome because if you buy this game, you will receive Counter-Strike Condition Zero and Condition Zero Deleted Scenes for FREE. You can play a normal shooter games with instant respawn or without it, but you can also play deathrun, surf, bhop, gun game, zombies and so on.Pros:+The multiplayer is great+The sound is good+The graphics are very good for that year+So many play styles+So many maps+The gameplay is hard but greatCons:-Hackers-Players who will destroy your game-Kids-VIP Servers who will OBLIGATE you to enter on their serversThis game reminded me how was the life when i was younger, so many hours in the front of PC, how i played it with friends and at school, how i ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off for the first time in a game and so on.

												I do believe this was the first FPS game I ever played and I remembered I really enjoyed it.This was the game who started e-sport growing, with players as Heaton, get_right, etc, and you can really tell how it has embarked the industry and media. CS is the top e-sport game in the world. There is reasons for that!Great gameplay, voice, maps, gamemodes, servers and many fun things to explore in this old FPS game.  If you want to play serious or just want to have a fun, this game has it.I'd recommend to buy it if you want to be apart and feel like you own something that has revolutionize the gaming industry and the e-sport genre. Or you could just buy CS:GO, that'll work aswell.. ;) "

												This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over. He didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a such an experience. Playing public servers with mods were very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse. Looking at the current e-sport scene it might not seem like much but back then it was different.Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist. I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games. It's harder though.I love this game. 1443 hours let know about this...			"

												This game is a timeless classic. It's one of the perfect FPS' that will ever be made. The movement, wall spamming, hitboxes, and map choices are what make this game the best. I've been playing this game since around 2003. Have played tournaments, been an admin for many clans, and strat caller for matches. This game takes serious skill to get good at. There is a huge learning curve, and that's what seperates this from other games, and noobs and pro's. The people who will get good at this game, are the ones who put the time and effort to learn everything. While the game can be a pick up and play game. Expect your ♥♥♥ to get handed to you, as veterans of the game still heavily play this, and they'll out shoot you 9/10 times. I have been called a cheater countless times in this game, and it all comes from me playing this day and night as a child, and my skills has also transferred into other FPS games. If you get good at CS, you'll more than likely be very good at other FPS games like Over Watch, CoD, 007, etc. Thats why I nominate this game for, The “Test of Time” Award. My friends think I'm dumb for playing a game developed in the 90's, but there's a reason for it. As I said, this game is the perfect FPS. It's a game I will play until I die. I can buy any new game on the market, and I'll be returning to this game shortly after. Take it from someone who has invested a lot of time in this game to get good. It's going to seem scary at first, as you will get rekt. But you will develop friends from within the various communities, and you will get better over time. And this skill set will make you better at other FPS games. CS 1.6 forever!			"

												Albeit being over a decade old, it's still an amazing game.I have played it both non steam and on steam, making total number of hours played well over 1500Counter Strike 1.6 does not come with built in game mode like deathmatch. Hence servers employ amxmodx[amxmodx.org] to create new game modes and modify game experience of existing ones.Some of game modes that I came across are:» Deathmatch classic half life dm» Capture The FlagA classic mode with each team having a flag and is required to bring opponents' flag to their base.» JailbreakA role play mod where prisoners must find a way to rebel and overthrow guards.» Missile Mod Choose a missile from missile menu and kill your opponent. Beware, for your opponent has missiles too.» PokeModPick up pokeballs lying around and choose active pokemon, you'll get its ability. For instance water pokemon give you heath regen while you are in water.» DeathrunA path laid with terrorist controlled traps is awaiting to be crossed by a huge pack of Counter terrorists thristy for terrorist's blood. But if you fall off, you die. Hence deathrun.» Hide n SeekAlthough the name says hide n seek, hiders don't hide. They simply run away and try to out trick seekers in a map skill and experience dependant. Hiders get an HE grenade, two flash grenades and a frost grenade while seekers have knives.» Kreedz (KZ)KZ mod is a non violent mod where players find their way through curvings and tricks of map by use of strafe, bunny hop, etc. It is a 'sport' type game, where players compete for the best times amongst the game's several courses.» Super Hero ModYou'll be given a list of heroes to choose from. You must choose two of them to get their powers.» Trouble in Terrorist Town (TTT)This mod is about a group of ""terrorists"" who have traitors among them, out to kill everyone who's not a traitor.» CodThere are various classes to select from, giving you different abilities including becoming near invisible when wielding a knife.» Zombie EscapeZombies are infecting everyone around you and you must survive for given time period. Zombies with hp of over 2000(depending of server) are coming for your brains! If they infect you, you become one of them and carry out their mission: infect all humans.» Surf ModA fun mod with ramps all over map. You must surf these ramps and perch on a 'vantage' point to get kills(or to get killed)» NightcrawlerNightcrawlers are around you totally invisible. pay attention on your team mates, if one dies, you have an idea of where the nightcrawler was at that time.All in all, it is a very amazing game.

												Advantages:a good idea, an opportunity to play on a networkDisadvantages:poor performance, graphics, textures, defects.Collection of my reviews on video games continues. Today we will speak about the most famous first-person shooter ""Counter-Strike"".Igrushechki this appeared quite a long time, already in the year 2000 and won the gamers. Then all these ""shooters"" were a novelty, and of course all like this game. I knew about it a long time, I heard enthusiastic talks about it, heard the word ""bots"", ""contra"", ""headshot of"", ""ks"". And what is it, I managed to learn five or six years ago. Games then I was not ""tempted"", but even then I have appreciated this game for three and a minus. Why? I'll explain later. Now the whole of the game. Created her notorious guys with the short name ""Valve"". About ""Valve's"" I will say this: all of their games on the subject stopped ""fantasy"" and ""half-real."" And this game belongs to the second category.So, the creators of the idea is quite tempting. Confrontation of the law against terrorists. They gave the game the proud name of ""Counter-Strike"", ie ""counter-attack"", but that's just shock, as such, no intrigue in this game. And that is? There are running with a gun, a gun, a knife. Oh yes, there is another grenade (use 0). And you can take the shield (not a bad thing). We can play for the ""special forces"" (which I did) and terror (very few people want). Most probably the main thing here is that we can play a ""bot"" that is, our friends runs the computer, the computer runs our enemies, but we can play and through the network, where all have real people. Play over the Internet more interesting, but still ""stupid"".I do not want to talk about any reality or fiction, but all I will say. I have not seen, not in movies, not in life, to special forces, and the terrorists jumped as the ""hare"", climbed the stairs, as if running on the ground. And finally, it is that even the slightest preparation is absent, the men can not hit no shield, no weapons, no arms / legs. The hostages, but here too there are, behave calmly, stand, no one is afraid of fear or cry.So, I criticized a little, and now tell you about the features. Game modes are different, rescuing hostages, rescue VIP-a, defusing a bomb, knife, grenade. A quest we give money, we buy ourselves, that it is necessary, for example, body armor (a rare case when it is not worn in advance on fighter (in reality)). On the job, we allocated time, which is usually enough.Each of the men says that he wants and commands that it is possible to give no one is listening. By the way, there you can sprinkle a logo that can be selected in advance. Beauty is not gaining.			"

This game introduced me to STEAM platform as it was a very popular mod of Half-Life. It has been worth every penny to buy this game and I still play it more than I play CSGO.I get reasonable pings (<50)  and I am on MTNL in Mumbai.If you are newbie lookin to buy I'd recommend you buy the Valve's complete pack during a major sale.

 Worth the Purchase in Every Regard Counter Strike is an extremely (legendary) well made mod that made itself a game, yes people, VALVe not only made true talent shine by employing those passionate and dedicated to gaming, they made what was originally an ambitious mod into the best of the FPS genre (perhaps of all time!). It's clearly an understatement that the Counter Strike franchise will be in the gaming history (e)books for centuries to come.It IS Lee's flagship, not Half Life, Half Life shines a light to the VALVe's era of games! This is what made VALVe popular in the first place and gave rise to the popularity of ESPORTS! In the casual and competitive scene, you can fit in at any point and it's always how you use your weapon and not how the weapon uses you!An utterly stupendous, glorious game from the 90's which has proven to many gamers that gameplay always will and shall for that matter, be the priority of games, it's mechanics, strategy and quick thinking and reflexes are key to this game. This game is still active and played by most players! Unique because of the ability to completely control the recoil of your weapon. Astounding as pretty much all the maps are beautifully designed to challenge players, even now I appreciate the creativity, the players, modding bases who have been allowing for some of the best content by the people, you to create.The gun mechanics are by far the best seen in any game I have ever played, period. No other game I've ever seen has matched the superlative quality of this game's gunplay. The way the guns fire feels like it has impact, tension and the feeling of that bullet coming out of the barrel gives this great flow of energy and satisfaction. Syngerizing with a great team is exhilarating as the bomb ticker sounds out in elevating cacophony before going KABOOM!Please buy it and support it!			"

												Now, what's funny is that I bought this game like 2 years ago, and sadly I have not been able to write a review about it, but I'll say, I remember like back in Elementary school like many years ago, I remember it was titled ""Half-Life: Counter-Strike"", and during that time, I was always crazy about Military FPS PC games and had an obsession with them as a kid, and when I saw people playing this game, I had no clue but to think that this was some kind of an ""Army Game"" like many other, but until I delved deeper watching people play it, I finally came to realize that this was not some kind of an ""Army Game"" where you go on missions and do your thing, but turns out that it was some kind of an online shooter where you do the mission with other online players around the world, but when I began to finally get to play it back in my old elementary school years, I would still recognize it as an ""Online Army Game"".

												This I suggest you buy instead of Counter-Strike: Source if you have a slower computer and you want the game to work fine. Even though its age, it is still very fun. One of the best, if not the best multiplayer you will ever have on PC. If you have ever heard of rumors and what-not over hackers and  and people who will kill you with an AK-47 from half the map away. I have yet to see a hacker in Couter-Strike and if your new, you will play on servers with less skilled people like yourself if you are new so don't worry about that. Great buy.

 Worth the Purchase in Every Regard Counter Strike is an extremely (legendary) well made mod that made itself a game, yes people, VALVe not only made true talent shine by employing those passionate and dedicated to gaming, they made what was originally an ambitious mod into the best of the FPS genre (perhaps of all time!). It's clearly an understatement that the Counter Strike franchise will be in the gaming history (e)books for centuries to come.It IS Lee's flagship, not Half Life, Half Life shines a light to the VALVe's era of games! This is what made VALVe popular in the first place and gave rise to the popularity of ESPORTS! In the casual and competitive scene, you can fit in at any point and it's always how you use your weapon and not how the weapon uses you!An utterly stupendous, glorious game from the 90's which has proven to many gamers that gameplay always will and shall for that matter, be the priority of games, it's mechanics, strategy and quick thinking and reflexes are key to this game. This game is still active and played by most players! Unique because of the ability to completely control the recoil of your weapon. Astounding as pretty much all the maps are beautifully designed to challenge players, even now I appreciate the creativity, the players, modding bases who have been allowing for some of the best content by the people, you to create.The gun mechanics are by far the best seen in any game I have ever played, period. No other game I've ever seen has matched the superlative quality of this game's gunplay. The way the guns fire feels like it has impact, tension and the feeling of that bullet coming out of the barrel gives this great flow of energy and satisfaction. Syngerizing with a great team is exhilarating as the bomb ticker sounds out in elevating cacophony before going KABOOM!Please buy it and support it!			"

												This will be more of a ''my experience with this game'' type of review, because saying things like ''great gameplay'' will not suit something I've experienced with Counter-Strike. Here you go:I remember back in 2002 I was at a friend's house and he was playing a game. I didn't know the name of the game nor I had internet to find it. A few weeks passed by and another friend came over and he didn't have a computer, so he brought a disc with a game in it. He told me that it was one of the best games and from that very moment I knew that it is going to be the game I saw at the other friend's house. When I saw the Counter-Strike logo I was filled with gamegasm (?) and I was so happy. I don't remember a day when I was so happy like back then. So, the journey started. I was playing it hardcore. Made friends, clans, was involved in communities and even made two myself. Counter-Strike is my first game which I played competitively and it was a whole experience. Playing public servers and maybe some servers with mods was very fun, but playing it competitively made it very intense and stressful. In a pleasant way, ofcourse.Shooters these days try to be different, advanced in a way. Sometimes the most simple games like Counter-Strike are the ones that live to this day. Also, there are plenty of mods to keep your attention to this game. The gameplay is very simple - defend as a Counter-Terrorist, attack as a Terrorist to plant the bomb or save the hostages as a CT. I am sure most of you already know this and I doubt there are gamers that haven't heard or know the gameplay of Counter-Strike, so I am sharing here more of my experience.I wish I could find my CS Anthology account which I've lost since 2008. So, I decided I am going to buy this game again and here you go - more than a thousand hours played. I still play it from time to time to this day and it brings back many great memories and I sometimes even stumble upon people I've played with years ago. I think Counter-Strike changed gaming in a major way and we wouldn't have many games like we have today, if this game wouldn't exist.I am sure many of people already have played games like CS:GO, but never the roots. I doubt any of you will play it for more than an hour, because it's much more simple and it differs a lot in my opinion from CS:GO and modern games.I am glad that I lived through the golden era of shooters and if I'd have to rate it, it'd 10/10 ofcourse,			"

PROS:+ great gameplay+ big active community+ great choice of weapons+ huge amount of mods+ lots of community created maps, weapons, AI, soundtracks, etc.CONS:- rare issues with graphic cards (especially for laptops)- has replacement  in form of newer CS gamesComment:What is there to introduce? This is a FPS game that most gamers know and the ones that don""t should. The laughable half an hour I have displayed here was just testing out the newly bought game. In reality I have played many many many hours with my friends. I played it in high school. I played it in college. I played it with friends after work. While the graphics may be old and this game replaced by its' younger sibblings it still holds out the test of time. While I am no longer able to get my friends together and play this , this game will always be a fond memory for me. And who knows maybe I will pick it up some day again. What I can do is recommend this game to anyone who has not played it or people who are thinking about pruchasing this digital copy. The basic concept of terrorists vs. counter-terrorists is really fun and with the modding community the amount of variation is almost limitless. So grab it if you can, it is very much worth it.			"

												Best Multiplayer first person shooter game of all time because nothing comes close to this, the more you play this game the more addicted you become and moreover it is fun at all levels of ability. Especially, as you do not need a high end gaming rig to run it, that makes it a game for everyone who likes competitive first person shooter which involves thinking and good aiming skills instead of mindless slaying. It combines the best of team based gaming with an authentic and therefore exciting approach to tactical ops. The ""just one more round"" addiction factor is very high. When you play it properly, with team work that clicks like a well-oiled machine, the game offers a sense of accomplishment and comradery that is simply amazing. Buy it, download it, whatever; just get on board and enjoy it. Sure-fire fun for the online enthusiast. 10/10			"

												This is what todays FPS games are based on, in one way or another. If the community was as big today as back in 2004 than this would no doubt be ahead of alot of other skill based (reaction times, sound direction skill) FPS games. I would certainly suggest this game above others.The only negative is ofc the age of this game. This game is about how good you are, not about how fancy it looks.			"

Don't be surprised that I have so little hours played onto my account, becouse I am still playing onto my half-life version with official cd-key.(played like 1000+ hours). This game is totally worth buying if you like playing in cooperation with friends. 2 team are tying to kill each other with one life. Point is: Terrorists are supposed to destroy a bombsite and Counter Terrorists are supposed to defend it. It works the same in hostage rescue, CT has to take hostages to safety. But if you are looking for a counter strike and good graphics, don't look here. Try CS:Source or Global Offensive.			"

Totuși sunt dezamagit de comportamentul jucatorilor români, nu toți, majoritatea… pe orice server exista certuri, injuraturi si scandaluri și chiar poate fără să faci nimic te alegi cu injuri. Dar în rest , jocul rămâne în continuare cel mai jucat joc chiar și luând in considerare CS:GO, SOURCE, tot 1.6 rămâne în inimile noastre, doar cu el am copilărit.. posibil principalele motive pentru care jocul acesta este așa de jucat, pot fi:- nu are cerințe mari;- nu costă chiar așa mult;- te poți juca alături de prieteni- foarte ușor de jucat pentru orice jucător..- grafica..acceptabilăRecomand cu drag acest joc.

PROS:+ great gameplay+ big active community+ great choice of weapons+ huge amount of mods+ lots of community created maps, weapons, AI, soundtracks, etc.CONS:- rare issues with graphic cards (especially for laptops)- has replacement  in form of newer CS gamesComment:What is there to introduce? This is a FPS game that most gamers know and the ones that don""t should. The laughable half an hour I have displayed here was just testing out the newly bought game. In reality I have played many many many hours with my friends. I played it in high school. I played it in college. I played it with friends after work. While the graphics may be old and this game replaced by its' younger sibblings it still holds out the test of time. While I am no longer able to get my friends together and play this , this game will always be a fond memory for me. And who knows maybe I will pick it up some day again. What I can do is recommend this game to anyone who has not played it or people who are thinking about pruchasing this digital copy. The basic concept of terrorists vs. counter-terrorists is really fun and with the modding community the amount of variation is almost limitless. So grab it if you can, it is very much worth it.			"
