												Rock of ages is a game about rolling down a hill; to squish a little man, literally. In Rock of Ages, there is a very minor story, hardly relating to the game. This isnt a bad thing because the game doesn't need a story to be enjoyed, however the story is humorous. The core gameplay aspect of Rock of Ages is rolling your rock down a slope riddled with defences in order to smash down an enemy gate. The opponents, are not only people from history, also attack your gate and the player must build their own defences in order to slow down or stop the other rock. You gain in game gold in order to pay for defences, and to upgrade your rock. The defences range from towers, elephants, catapults and even bombs. These are used to slow down the enemy rock, if enough damage is done to the rock, it shrinks, dealing less damage. The upgrades for your rock are simple, adding metal spikes or lighting your rock on fire, dealing extra damage. Damage is also decided by the speed of the rock when it collides with the door; the faster the rock, the harder it hits.Rock of ages also has a few mini games, one of which is skeeball. Rock of ages also has trading cards, and very easy achievements, making the game apply to a larger audience. Rock of Ages does things rightIts story is humorousThe gameplay is overall enjoyableEasy 100% achievementsThe co-op is good fun with friendsThe mini games are mostly funThe in game destruction looks goodIts overall very originalRock of ages does some things wrongIt can be repetitive Slightly boring to some older gamersThe Defences aren't overly effectiveThe respawn locations can really mess with the playerLacks real substanceOverall rock of ages isn't bad, it's just basic. The $10.99(CAD) price tag is way too high unless the player is planning to 100% it. Its a fun game to play with friends, however. It also makes the game lots more fun. "

												This game is like someone threw Monty Python, Tower Defence, and Marble Madness in a blender, turned it on high for a few minutes, arranged it into a delicious dessert, and sprinkled some history on top for flavor enhancement. Honestly, how can you go wrong with a game in which you control a gigantic boulder (of varying shapes and sizes - I must say the fist is my favorite), and use it to shatter your opponent's gate? Even better, you get to squash their defenseless, flailing forms immediately afterwards to an immensely satisfying whoopie cushion sound. If that is not enough to satisfy, there are also trained war bovines, elephants, and mammoths for you to use and abuse in the defense of your fortress. There are also elephant-launching airships..  If you are like me, you may derive much more pleasure from their strategic placement to troll your enemies, whether they be human players (yes, this game has online multiplayer) or historical figureheads. Highly Recommend for some hard core laughter.			"

												Oh man, this game is great! You see, Rock of Ages is actually an accurate historical representation of medieval warfare. Instead of having men, women and children slaughter each other mindlessly over some petty argument, disputes were settled by using sentient boulders. Yes, rocks. As this round stone, you travel through the ages of classical art (t)rolling and smashing everything on your way! Just remember though, you are not alone. Just as it happens, the enemy team has sent away a boulder of their own, and you have to race down with them! Whoever splats (oh god I love that sound) the enemy general, wins.All in all, hilarious visuals and sounds, fun gameplay, some surprisingly complex base defense features and absolutely fantastic multiplayer modes, together make this game a must buy. This game has the Pidgin's Feather Seal of Approval, 5/5 would poop on.			"

												This game has a ton of personality, and for me, despite a few flaws, it goes a long way. It really is ""Monty Python meets Super Monkey Ball meets bowling."" ACE Team really knew how to put some outlandish material into the industry. Besides a few annoyances in gameplay (i.e. minor glitches, weird A.I., etc.) and somewhat abrupt ending, the game really is a gem of it's own kind and definitely worth a look.			"

												Lots of fun with this game especially in online. Objective is to roll down a hill with enough speed and health to do damage to the opponents gate at the bottom. During time outs, with the money you earned on rolls you and your opponent have to place obstacles which include elephants, fans, towers, cannons and other obstacles on the opponents hill to weaken and slow them down. Sounds awesome, right? There's more modes and much more fun to this game, it's a gem that needs to be in your Steam library.			"

												Top fun game for a limited time I feelThe multiplayer is really good fun and where all the fun is. When plYing solo I found the game boring, but then only a few rounds of multiplayer was enjoyable. The controls are simple to use with nothing special needed. The graphics are nice and clear, nothing special or serious but the game has a unique graphics setting which is more cardboard like.The audio is amusing and funny to listen to. Some of the sounds are very funny to listen too, from the scream when breaking into base, to the odd balls the game makes. The game is really good fun and easy to get used too, but the multiplayer is where all the fun is just after a few hours I became bored of the game.  Do not get me wrong it is worth the time you want to play because writing this review, the game is on sale for £1 so for that price you cannot complain.			"

												Since this is on sale right now (20th of October today), I wanted to recommend this game.first of all, it's rediculous. That is already a good enough reason for you to get it. It is just pure ♥♥♥♥ing rediculousness. You control a mother♥♥♥♥ing stone ball that smashes ♥♥♥♥. Oh and you're competing vs various gods and historically relavant people. To be more specific, it's basically a two sided race to the opponents fortress gate (you break the gate with your big ♥♥♥ rock), you have to get there as fast as possible while also avoiding obstacles placed by the opponent, when your rock has hit the gate or got destroyed by some mean elephant (no seriously, this game had elephants before Far Cry 4), you get to place these same obstacles.Very whimsical, uplifting, and sometimes challenging. A truly great game. Cheap, and easy to pick up and play (levels are fairly short and straight forward). ♥♥♥♥ing buy it!			"

PresentationRock of Ages isn't exactly the type of game that you'll become instantly attracted to after the first glance, but looking beyond that and getting to play it will most definitely change your impression. The words that describe this game the best would be somewhere in the area of a tower defense with two ends where your only attack option to help you reach your enemy's gate is your giant boulder, boulder that you control. The story mode puts you and your customizable boulder travelling through time and space, starting with ancient Rome and ending with the Renaissance era, fighting different characters from each time and location such as Leonardo da Vinci, Plato or Napoleon Bonaparte. There is no real difference between all those battles except for the map where the battle takes place, but the short, humorous animations that introduce the battle are a delight, as they make fun of anything and everything such as the moment when Leonardo da Vinci realizes that kids nowadays play with boulders in a video game created using ""computieres"". There are plenty of such moments and even though there is no actual plot to tie-in those battles apart from the fact that your boulder is inexplicably rolling from one battle to the next one after you've defeated your previous adversary, you can return to each one of them at any given time in order to collect the remaining hidden keys, improve your scores or simply because you wanted to have a quick laugh at one of those animations one more time. Choosing your character and your boulder is easy and intuitive, having a simple option in the main menu that allows you to select those and apply them to all the modes, including Time Trial and Multiplayer.Rating: 8.5GameplayRock of Ages was meant to be a tower defense game at its core, but that isn't the thing that makes it fun to play, as the boulder rolling mechanic will steal the show every single time you play. In theory a winning combination would consist of a valid strategy in tower defense in order to stop your enemy from reaching your gate and good boulder-controlling skills so you can get past your opponent's defences and crash into his gate, but that isn't exactly the case as for most of the times your defences will do nothing, but slow down your enemy's boulder for a bit and unless you're playing against the AI which is dumb enough to get stuck in random places at times, it is almost impossible for a human being to fail getting past any number of defences, so the game becomes more of a speed test, awarding the fast one to roll his boulder into the enemy gate, using the tower defense mechanic only to buy a few extra seconds. One more thing that influences the gameplay comes in the form of boulder power-ups, which range from the Angel Wings that allow you to perform one double jump to the Sun Upgrade which will deal considerably more damage if you manage to get to the enemy gate with your power-up still intact. After finishing the main story, you will definitely want to play against another human being as the AI's actions are predictable and there's no real challenge in defeating one of the animated characters one more time, and even if you do have all the maps from the story at your disposal in Multiplayer, matchmaking isn't as smooth as it could be, as you can spend entire minutes finding someone to play with and even when you do, it will become boring after a while since the fastest one on a map will always win.Rating: 7GraphicsThe game is built using the Unreal Engine, which makes it a pretty thing to look at, but even so it is far from realistic and the physics can sometimes be weird, bouncing your boulder into a different direction. The crash effects are decent and the boulder damage, while not the best, does its job showing you what you did to your boulder after smashing it into all those towers. The level design on the other hand, makes things seem legit, as Rome will somehow look as you'd imagine Rome in miniaturistic style where boulders are supposed to roll for some reason.Rating: 7AudioThere is no voice acting, but the sound effects and grunts that the characters make sell the ironic theme of the game and make those short animations fun to watch. The soundtrack might not be the best, but it is certainly fixed to deliver the background ambient that fits the on-screen boulder-rolling in each of the stages, making those levels feel authentic to the period of time and the location where each of those characters belong in real history.Rating: 8ExtrasThe story can easily be completed within 5 hours, but afterwards you've got plenty of mini-games, reasons to jump back into the action for the missing keys and the Time Trial mode which will keep you busy for a few more hours if you want to achieve the gold medal for each one of the maps. The multiplayer, even with its issues can be a fun experience, especially if you find someone to play with for a longer period of time so you won't have to go through the matchmaking system after each match. Apart from the Online Multiplayer, the game also features a Local Multiplayer component which allows you and a friend to play all the modes in split-screen, however on the PC version you will need 2 controllers in order to do that, something that most of the PC gamers don't have, and considering the fact that the game only uses the direction keys, the game could have been easily played on the same keyboard.Rating: 7.5VerdictRock of Ages is fun and humours, so if you're looking for something different and with a healthy dose of parody humour, look no further, as this game will keep you busy for hours to come if you're digging its concept and you're willing to look past its flaws. There are limitations, without any doubt, and even with all the content package included in the game there was much more that could have been done, but for what it is, the game can easily keep you and a friend busy for an entire night, doing a bunch of different things and playing with the game's mechanics to try out new stuff.Rating Overall: 7.6Check out the full review and a lot more about Rock of Ages at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=234 "

												Gameplay:The idea of the Rock of Ages is unique, you control a rock rolling over various surfaces to destroy enemy's castle door, the enemy has the exact same goal, destroy your castle door first. It usually takes 3-4 rocks to destroy enemy's castle door. Once your rocks finish rolling or right at start of the game, there will be a period of time where you'll be waiting for a new rock to become available, giving you time to build defense units (towers, TNTs etc.) on the enemy's road to slow down the enemy boulder, or even destroy the rock completely. At start of the game you are given a specific amout of credits, allowing you to buy defense units from those. You gain credits when you hit enemy castle door and when you destroy the enemy defense units with your rock. There are 3 keys laid over every map, after every few levels, you'll require a specific amout of keys to be able to proceed further on in the singleplayer. The keys are easy to get and you can always replay any level, and even if you lose the game, you still get the keys you collected with the rock from the map, so there's no need to worry about the key part.In boss battles you simply are 1 rock inside some sort of arena where you fight the bosses, the goal is to kill the boss by hitting its weak point with the rock 3 times without getting destroyed by bosses' attacks.The rock HP system is quite complicated. The base rock has 3 layers each having some amount of hitpoints it can take before breaking. When a layer gets destroyed, your rock gets smaller, and inflicts less damage on enemy's castle doors, it doesn't affect boss battles anyhow though, except for the rock simply being smaller, making it a little harder to take damage, but also to hit the enemy. There are another types of rocks that you can buy for credits, such as a rock with 4th layer or a burning rock which basically has its first layer set on fire, making it easier to break through enemies, but it can get extinuished in levels containing water, changing it into normal 3 layer rock. Your rock can also fall out of every map, but it'll just respawn on the nearest checkpoint and it won't lose hp at all, so there's no need to be extra careful.That should be everything important I found worthy of mentioning from the gameplay, with that out of the way, I'd like to describe the other parts of the game.Game's art:You start at south coast of nowadays Italy's borders in times of Greek mythology, every new level, you move a bit forward in time and across the map of Europe (Borders of today's Italy, France, Spain and Portugal) , starting on tutorial fight with Hades in ancient greek times, moving throughout the levels all the way to late middle ages, fighting characters such as Charlemagne, Leonardo da Vinci and many more. There are short cutscenes before start of every battle, showing the enemies you are going to fight in sort of comic way, it's up to your personality whether you find them funny or insultive to Europe's history. Personally I liked most of them, but few of them took it too far (fighting the Plague, displayed as some sort of skeletal figure of human body for example). The design of the levels themselves was pretty simple, yet still nice. I could see a lot of effort going into design of the game's bosses. Except for some of the cutscenes, I liked everything from the game art-wise.Controls:I've got nothing to criticize in this part, the controls are fairly simple and work as they should.Performance:I was able to run the game smoothly on a low tier laptop without a single problem in framerate.Other:-The game also has multiplayer, but I haven't had the luck in finding someone to play with.-The singleplayer is pretty short, a good player will be able to finish the game within 2 hours. For average player, like I am, it shouldn't take more than 3 hours either.-Majority of the levels are easy, you can just place several elephants at the same place, and on most of the maps it will screw over the enemy rock's AI in single player, as the rock will get completely blocked and destroyed by the elephant defense units. Some of the defense units may feel much stronger compared to the other. I only found 1/2 of the defense units effective for most of the maps-The game could get repetitive after some time.Summary:Pros:-Unique idea of the game-Almost flawless design of the levels and cutscenes-Perfect controls-Perfect performanceCons:-The singleplayer won't take too long to finish, I'd be really suprised if it took someone more than 4 hours-Jokes in some cutscenes were taken too farFinal words:This is a first serious game review I've ever done. Took over an hour to do. I initially wanted to keep it short, but it seems like I failed doing so. Still only tried to include my view of the most important parts of the game, so hope I did not forget anything. At the time of writing the review, the game is 9.99€ in Steam store, I got the game with 75% discount due to a discount coupon for it I had, my friend reccomended it to me. I definitely don't regret spending those two and a half Euros on the game, it was worth it. If you're considering buying the game, I would say it's worth even its full price, but if it seems like too much to you, just wait for a discount, definitely worth taking at 5€ and less. I'm reccomending this game because the idea and its execution astonished me and I enjoyed the singleplayer all the way through.Thank you for reading this review, if you have any feedback, leaving it in the comments would be appreciated, it could help me if I'd be reviewing another game in the future.

												Roll your way through history as Sisyphus and his boulder. Flatten historical figures and classical concepts. Rock of Ages has a great art style and is a robust tower defense game that offers a different twist on the tower defense genre. You have to both protect your base and attack the enemy’s fortifications as a boulder that can be upgraded. Rock of Ages also has a great sense of humor which is highlighted in its cutscenes featuring both modern and historical references. Overall, it is a rock solid game that is worth playing both for its fun story and gameplay.			"

												A surprisingly good title; looked like shovelware or a C-title but it turned out to be real effin good and original.You control a boulder on its way to hit the castle doors of the enemy in each level. You navigate a map littered with traps and various other items that will wittle away at your boulders size (thereby decreasing the damage done to castle walls). Once the walls are hit, their health decreases-the aim is to get their health to 0 and then squish the person inside. After navigating the course and either suceeding or failing to get to the walls, you're then taken to an aerial view of the enemie's map, with the ability to spend gold for traps to make their boulder's descent just as difficult. Simple game, awesome concept, and great use of great works of art in the character animations. You go through several historical periods of western society, and since the character art is composed of animating still images of historical works of art, there's a nifty change in the art style as you progress through the ages. It's brilliant.And an obligatory shout out to Def Leppard hereshort game; great concept, cheap price; good deal			"

I'm not sure if it's completely worth the price, because there's not tons of content, but if it's on sale you can't pass this up.It's like someone mashed an RTS, Mythology, and comedy all in one game, which they did! Multiplayer can be a bit buggy, but other than that this game has barely any glitches.

Goofy premise, unique style, fun gameplay, and great delivery. It all comes together in a great package and niche-feeling theme. Its a really unique take on the tower defense genre. You build defenses to protect your gate against your enemy's weapon; A rolling rock. But the game also features offensive play. You roll your own rock as well. A ball rolling game is a simple concept but still has to control in a satisfying way and this does on both keyboard and mouse and controller. While there is strategy involved, there's also a touch of racing as you try to get your roll and hit in before the AI to get ahead. It makes for some great fun. But the game's faults make it hard to outlandishly praise and even make the simple recommendation difficult. It is plain fun when everything is working right though! And you get a good amount of fun if you go for all the extras and collectables or whatever they are. The game felt really un-optimized for me as performance was lacking. Later levels with more commotion led to severe framerate drops. Severe. Even on the lowest of settings. There's people running it flawlessly on laptops so it was partial (bad) luck of the draw that it wasn't optimized for my toaster. But a quick search showed I was hardly alone and there were people even editing .ini files and such just looking for an extra frame. A little too messy and too much effort for a game that should run fine to begin with as far as I was concerned. So I just lowered the resolution and windowed it to tough out the last third of it. The story mode took me around 5hrs while going for all the extras. Solid length for such a ""small"" game. There's a few other modes left if I were inclined. The bosses while inventive departures from standard play and funny were usually quite clunky. They ended up a test of wills and a relief to finish rather than anything resembling a challenge and satisfaction. And the unique and inventive tower defense side of the gameplay did get fairly shallow once you developed strategies that worked against the AI well. Perhaps the depth truly lies in multiplayer, but that was never on my radar to play. Was a great game to get in a bundle like I did somewhere along the line and I wholeheartedly recommend it if its a deal, bundle or other bargain. But if the theme and gameplay idea isn't jumping out at you, its an easy skip. Its definitely a niche audience that will get the most out of it. With its problems it probably won't win anybody over by actually getting your hands on it and playing. A book that can be judged by it's cover perhaps? I could be off base here. But hey, if the cover looks interesting, take a roll for sure! Sequel in the works as well!			"

												Rock of Ages is Monty Python's Flying Bowling Alley. The gameplay is excellent, as is the art style and the humour. I would make two suggestions. 1.) Use the ghost rock. Even when I was struggling to get the last few keys, I never tired of hearing the rock ""boooooo"" as it fell off the track. This should minimize frustration.2.) Use gold mines. If you use gold mines during the first run, the opponent will get a free pass to your door, but the second time you can load up on defenses and stop them cold.			"

												Rock of Ages has faults - it's samey and repetitive in long-play sessions, for example, and if the trailers don't tickle you then there's little chance the full game will impress. However, considering the low price and artistic spark that lies at the heart of the game, Rock of Ages becomes a difficult game to turn down, even if the mechanical side of the experience doesn't quite rival the creative side, and there are occasional glitches with the physics of enemy AI.

												You have to shoot Appollo in the ♥♥♥♥ with cannons, you can play as Bachus, patron of the half-naked, drunk fat peopleNow that's out of the way, let's review. The game is best summed up as ""Monty Python Bowling"". It has a phenomenally executed art style. The 2d cutscenes and menu screen look like something John Cleese would've designed himself. As for the gameplay, essentially you have to set up a tower defense on your side of the mountain (there are over 20 maps) and get through your opponent's defence using a rather inert boulder, similair to those platformer bowling games. Your workers make a new boulder every now and then and it takes a while to smash the enemy castle. The gameplay is somewhat balanced, although cow defences are sadly underpowered. The game itself is worth buying for the sole reason of how climatic it is. It has a fair price for shooting Appollo in the ♥♥♥♥. With cannons			"

												Rock of Ages is a fun game with a quirky style and sense of humor. You play as Sisyphus, rolling boulders down various levels to break an enemy gate, while your opponents (a series of historical figures) are simultaneously trying to do the same to you. Rolling the stone is only half of the equation, though. In between rolls, you also have to set up defenses to hinder your opponent's progress towards your gate. It's an interesting mashup of genres. Aside from the gameplay, there is one other cool thing about the game - the cutscenes. Between levels, you are treated to very odd (but really funny) paper-cutout interludes starring the aforementioned historical figures. The scenes are reminiscent of Terry Gilliam's work from Monty Python, and are very enjoyable. All in all, this is a pretty fun game that works best in small doses (it tends to get a bit repetitive if playing for extended durations). The music is great too! I definitely say give it a shot if you're up for something different.			"

'Rock of Ages' is 'Marble Madness' as tower defense. The developer 'ACE Team' is an indie studio, which has done magnificent work to this game. You play as a rock through certain decades of human history. You roll down the track and you get money for destroying the enemies buildings/units. The enemy does the same on the opposite of the level. At the beginning of the game and during the pauses you are able to buy and place buildings/units to stop/hurt the enemy. At last you have to destroy the fortress gate of the enemy as first.Pros:+ Very nice idea+ Humorously story and design (i laughed a lot)+ Retro feeling (Marble Madness)+ Multiplayer+ Achievements (easy to collect)+ 3 different modes (War, Time Trial, and SkeeBoulder)+ You can jump+ Boss fightsCons:- no adjustable difficult level (far too lightly)- there could be more levels/bosses(- no high replayability)Recommended, even if it's not on sale, because of the very humorously """"story"""" and the funny art/design.8/10 "

												This game rocks! No, seriously, it is a good example of how to mix fun gameplay and educational value. It is a humorous travel through history, art, mythology and popular culture. Sisyphus becomes a tragic hero who defies the god Kronos with his own torture instrument: the rock. Kronos even eats the rocks, like in the myth.

												The most unique and quirky game I've ever played, and likely ever made.Made by a team in my home country (Go Chile!), Rock of Ages is an odd hybrid between a bowling racer and tower defense. The game is a sort of duel between you and an opponent (either human or AI-controlled) in which you each throw boulders down a track toward your doors. Between rolls, money you earned from rolling your boulder can be spent on tower-like constructions to slow down, weaken and hopefully destroy your opponents boulder.The game features a huge amount of very fun maps, to the point of which it could've been a full game without the tower defense aspect. The humor is, as said by others, Monty Python-esque, with 2D paper-like animations for characters. The campaign takes you through much of history, with plenty of genuinely funny cutscenes!This is honestly a game I cannot recommend highly enough. It's quirky, sure, but the humor alone is worth the $10. Good luck, and first downhill wins!			"

												If you want originality, this is probably the game for you. Just think about this :It's a mix of action platformer and tower defense, which is quite a startThe most famous pieces of art in history are used as assetsCutscenes are Monthy Python-esque movies parodying hisctorical figuresYou can crush Leonardo da Vinci as Napoleon. And that's just an exampleMichelangelo's David statue is a boss, and it scratches its butt when boredThis is just a few examples of the crazy things that can happen in this game. And it's not just about the humor : the gameplay is also interesting. To summarize it, it is a duel between two players (using crazy historical figures avatars) who both are on one side of a symmetrical map. The game alternates between a phase where you buy traps to set on your opponent's side, and a phase where you try to roll your boulder down your side of the map.Your opponent obviously has set up traps on your side (as you did on his), and you have to try taking as little damage as possible from them in order to damage the door at the bottom and eventually break it. All of this in real time so you have to be quick as well.It's a bit of a shame that the AI is fairly easy to exploit (a wall with catapults behind will usually wreck it). The AI also isn't the best at laying down the best trap combinations on your side of the map. Because of this the campaign will not resist you for long if you are a veteran gamer. Casuals should like this relaxed experience, though.If you can find a friend to play with online then the true potential of the game mechanics shines through.The game isn't very expensive anyway, so I still recommend it if you don't have a human opponent : the few hours it'll take you to see all the jokes and complete all the solo games modes are well worth it already.

												Running over the course of History with a giant boulderIt has be admired that someone came up with a simple concept of pushing a bolder down a hill and making it into stragety game. In this terry gilliam inspired world you are sisyphus the once banished king of ephyra who was doomed to all eternity to push a boulder hill only to do that exact same thing for the rest of eternity. But one day ol'sisy got the idea to instead use that boulder to escape his prison and from there go on journey through history to challenge famous figures in history against there giant boulders. People such as Vlad the impaler, Napoleon, and... a goat, okay sure why not. The whole game is about getting your boulder down the hill to smash against the enemy gate to literally crush the opposition into a fine pancake and move onto your next challenge. The courses are usually filled with normal obstacles like houses and people, traversing the enviroment for the fastest speed is the name of the game. But when you face off against your opponent they will set up more dangerous obstacles, such as defense towers, catapults, and elephants. All that will chip away at the layers of your rock decreasing its impact and sending it back to the top of the hill for a second go. But while your jumping and cereaning, the enemy will use there own boulder against your fort. You learn by your enemy that you have to create obstacles to stop the enemy boulder. The key being to find spechific spot that will slow down the deadly or just halt it all together. Its an interesing air of stragety and travesel that isn't seen very often in tower defense games. The boulder fantastically designed, its starts off slowly and requires a lot momentum to leave an impact in the enemy door. Those few seconds of falling off a cliff or being stunted by an elephant will cost you time and force to win the match. There are also varietes of the boulder, such as the spike boulder and the fire boulder, that will give you some extra fire power on getting past enemies. And getting past enemies is not that hard as the enemy boulder doesn't seem to know how to properly get around obstacles but a well time jump will get you over nearly anything. There are also boss battle in this strangely enough. Where you have to just aim for the right spot and ram into the bosses weak point to win. There pretty interesting from a design aspect but the gameplay around them amount to little then waiting for the right moment to strike, not really implementing much in way of stragety. Rock of ages is fascinating look into a tower defense game. It has funny visuals, responsive controls, and never really gets to hard in the way of gameplay. It may not be the longest game but if you have a passing interest in running over queen elizabeth, well this is the game for you... ya weirdo.			"

												Rock of Ages is a fun and ""Rocking"" game (sorry that was really tempting XD. Anyway back to the review). When you play, you make buildings to defend your ""door"" (your base). Soon as your door is broken you lose! You break their door YOU WIN!!! When you have finished with the buildings ITS TIME TO ATTACK!! You destroy their base by breaking their door as i said earlier. Sooner or later the game starts to get harder. Oh and by the way you can customize your own rock and dont forget you can get a trollface rock so you have the trollface on your boulder/rock. Rock of Ages is a hell lot a fun game and definitely worth buying! To wrap it up, I'm just warning you, sometimes the game can glitch and move your mouse to the left corner for only that one defence bit then it goes back to normal. And the game is pretty ragey. I died 2 times on 1 level and I raged so much i hurt my hands XD. But the score that I'm giving this amazing masterpiece 10/10			"

												Basically, you roll this big rock and squish everything that gets in your way. The game offers humor and entertainment in a certain Monty Python style. The absurd cutscenes and the enjoyment of not knowing what to expect next are the main selling points, but the gameplay in itself is pretty fun too. It's simple, casual and fun for a couple of nights. It's not rocket science and there's not much room for finesse. Mostly you just roll away and hope for the best, but you can also set traps for your opponent. There's also a player vs. player mode. I think the game's definitely worth a couple of dollars, but don't spend your life savings on it - if the humor doesn't appeal to you at all, the game mechanics alone probably aren't that satisfying. I personally loved the paper cutout art style and all the funny little details. I didn't find the gameplay super addictive, but I wanted to complete one level after another just to see what crazy historical figure I was up against next, so in a way I was hooked right from the start.

												I'll start by saying that if you're a fan of Monty Python, this is for you.I am sadly late to the party on this, but.. This game honestly stands out from most of my library just in the way of it spewing out the best form of crude humor, where fart jokes actually are well done, quite a rare find in anything, especially with how they seem to be thrown around now-a-days because of a target audience they seem to want to attract but it's not pulled off in any form of decent or amusing way, it's just there for the sake of being there. Now that being said on with my ramblings.It steps out of the normal kind of game and steps into a comic like take on historic figures such as Plato and Aristotle, Napoleon, Leonardo Da Vinci etc, made into a tower defense video game, developed by the ACE Team. You are Sisyphus, a deceased character that was doomed to eternally rolling a cursed boulder up a hill only to have it roll back down before it can reach the top (Yes, I brushed up on my history for this), you suddenly get the bright idea to break out of your hell to then be the one rolling boulders over historical figures and amusingly squish them before they can squish you.. Which I must add, is more than satisfying. Especially with the little girly squeal.The multiplayer is also an amusing little add with being able to squish friends or just random people in other lobbies. It's not only amusing but quite challenging due of different play styles which also goes through in story mode as each historical figure has different tactics and items they use more of. Time trials are a good way to get familiar with maps to get the fastest time around each track finally we come to skeeball, just when you thought this game couldn't get any better, they add in carnival games to the mix. What more needs to be said.Rock of Ages is definitely one of the most unusual games I have played but one of the best. Sadly a bit short and lacking in the levels department in my opinion as I could have gone on for at least another 10 or so levels, but with solely that whinge aside, it is a perfect balance of amusing and challenging but not punishing and tedious.. I have not come across a game like that for quite some time. Honestly, this game is glorious and I would recommend it to anyone.			"

												On one hand, the story is too easy but with funny videos. On the other hand, the multiplayer is very competitive and requires skills. Nice learning curve, because you need to learn the shortcuts and best places for traps, on each map.You alternate playing a rock to reach as fast as possible the enemy's castle door, and then defending by placing different kind of buildings in the path of your enemy's rock. Everything happens in real time so you have to be fast and vicious.If you have a friend to play with or if you like competition over frustration, this game is totally worth the little price!

												Rock of Ages manages to be totally silly and still be a great game. Obviously made by people with a sense of humor, everything is specially designed to make you smile. The goofy nature of the game makes sure it’s never really taken too seriously while still being challenging in its own right.The game itself plays part race, part tower defense as you and your opponent take control of boulders rolling down separate but identical paths. Each player earns gold which can be used to purchase and place obstacles to slow the progress of the other player. The first player to smash their opponent’s avatar behind their gate wins. It’s a simple premise but each map offers a new challenge to overcome keeping the game from getting stale.The game still looks really good and feels exactly like you’d expect it to. Both the singleplayer and multiplayer modes are a blast, though admittedly you might have a hard time finding another person to play with. If you’re looking for something solid and unique, Rock of Ages is an awesome casual title. Just don’t forget to buy your friends a copy if you’re looking to try out the PvP. "

I never seen before a game designed on the old history books illustrations, and even if they are not that pleasant to the eyes of whom is addicted to the digital, in Rock of ages finds new light. With monty-python inspired comedy cutscenes and various cameos througout the game, it certainly rips a chuckle during the fun gameplay.Second: the gameplay.It's original genre cannot really be defined. It can gather people who love racing games and at the same time who hates it. Part of it is dedicated to the rock rolling towards the door, trying to avoid the obstacles placed by our nemesis. The other half involves you actually placing those obstacles against the rock of your own nemesis. Important of this kind of gameplay, as deducted, is guided by the multiplayer. And Atlus knew it well. In fact this is one of the few gems to support local split screen multiplayer on PC, Needless to say i've had the most fun i've ever experienced when i brought a friend home to play.Soundtrack, graphics and the whole game itself is neatly served to be enjoyed with the rest of the game, only cons? It can get boring after some hours of gameplay, thankfully Atlus provided the game with 20 maps all very different one another.8.5/10			"

Intro & SummaryACE Team have many of the things I love in a games developer- wit, charm, intelligence, uniqueness and rarity, and most of all, short, fun games. Rock of Ages is a great example, what would've been rolling rocks down a hill at stuff in anyone elses hands, has become a philosophical and historical ♥♥♥♥-take with some deep strategy and intense fun in multiplayer. The intelligent parts and humour were just as important for the developers as the gameplay, and that makes this title shine.Highlights* Great sense of humour, reminds me of Monty Python and Black Adder at times. May make you Crack up..* Offers surprisingly deep strategic and tactical gameplay for those who want it* Intelligence and wit that is far too rare in gamesMistakes* Slightly repetitive at times, needs to keep Rolling faster* This game isn't as hard as rock, it's too easy at timesRecommendationsRock of Ages is available for £6.99 / 9.99€ / $9.99 and routinely goes on sale for up to -80%. With a 5 hour campaign and an even better multiplayer experience, it's definitely worth a buy when on sale.* The soundtrack is pretty good, and included for free* You can unlock the Trollface boulder skin by winning a multiplayer War match "

												+ Silly/fun all round; graphics, gameplay, audio and concept+ Quite a unique idea for a game- A little too buggy for my tastes - hard to control boulder with lots of pathing issues- Defense mechanisms seem pretty useless.Conclusion:Fun and simple game. Not really something I'll play a lot of but I can appreciate the positives. There's nothing to really stop me from recommending you to buy this, if it tickles your fancy and has the right price.

												I just want to say this one got me replacing my keyboard and milk after my boulder made a ""Bzffplt"" on Agamemnon.Relatively simple game, with VERY funny soundtrack and humorous story. Gameplay is fairly simple. You roll boulders to the other's fortress door until it breaks down, and you score by killing the historical or mythological MVP inside. The very simple yet surprisingly fun game with artstyle geniusly rehashed from real historical artwork for comedic effect, the depth of the game as you actually need to build obstacles to block enemies' boulders as they will do the same to you, and the great physics combined into the game make up for either a great time, or a frustrating one. Depends on you. I think I bought this on a discount, cheap ol' me. But god dang this one always gave me a good laugh and a light, good fun whenever I open it. Consider getting it for your kids. Just remember not to press too hard on the keyboard when directing the boulder, though.			"

												This game was just pure enjoyment for me from beginning to end. It's fairly short and even if you do all the content you'll still probably be finished with the game in less than 20 hours. It's just a very silly and fun game though.It controls kind of like Marble madness. It's a racing game where you control a giant boulder and have to try and make it to the end of the stage without getting the boulder damaged. This is harder than it sounds because while you are trying to make it to your opponent's castle to destroy it, they are trying to make it to yours.You can place traps down to mess up the other boulder. These are things like giant fans to blow it off the stage, elephants to crush it, and canons to blast it off track.This game has a great sense of humor and makes countless references to classic artwork and history.

												Rolling giant boulders downhill smashing all that stands in their way ought to be immensely fun. Somehow, it isn't here. They've done this weird vs. approach where you and an opponent throw boulders down the slope at each other's gates, first one smashed loses, and that's good enough for an arcade game. Along the way you smash dwellings, inhabitants, and similar bric-a-brac to get money, which buys you fortifications you can use to defend your gates against your opponent's rock.Problem is, the fortifications don't actually do much of anything to deter an incoming boulder—maybe they would if you had time to lay out defenses strategically, but because everything takes place in real time you're never given the chance to build your defenses with any kind of deliberation. So with the vast majority of the game's mechanics going un- or underused, it becomes a mad rush to launch your boulder first. Which quickly becomes less than interesting. It's entirely possible that the available defenses become more useful and engaging to play with in later levels, but the game doesn't hold my interest long enough to get at them. Which is really too bad. The art and sound design are unreservedly fantastic, with this great whimsical Terry Gilliam Python-era animation thing happening. I just wish the game was as much fun to play as it is to look at.			"

												Rock of Ages is a charming, humorous, and highly original game.The basic premise is this: you control a boulder rolling across a twisted battlefield of ramps, obstacles, and enemy traps. Your aim is to destroy your opponent's gate.As you destroy your opponent's defenses, you accumulate money to spend on building upgrades. These upgrades can be either single-use power-ups for your boulder to make it stronger or more deadly. Or, you can spend the money on defenses like elephants, dynamite, and catapults that can knock your opponent's boulder off the map. You get to place these obstacles wherever you want on the map.So, on one hand RoA is like a wacky driving game, but on the other it is like a tower defense game. The balance between these two is perfect -- it is fast-paced and really executes the central mechanics well.Where the game really shines is the campaign and art direction inspired by Art History. Each level has you progress from ancient Greece, across Europe and through various artistic styles. In Italy, the levels have a High Renaissance art theme. There is Rococo in France and a Romantic (Goya-inspired) theme in Spain. And each level unlocks a new type of defense (dynamite, flying machines, ). for you to place in your. Perhaps the only issue is difficulty: it may be too easy as the AI is good at placing defenses but not so great at driving its boulder. But if you want more of a challenge there is always the multiplayer or the time trial mode (with scoreboards), so the game does not get old.Basically, if you like the look of the game from the trailers -- get it! It delivers.			"

												In a world were 99% of all new releases of games fall in 4 categories (FPS, RPG, horde, RTS), Rock of Ages is an extremely welcome addition. It is innovative, creative, very fun, addictive. Playability - and replayability - deserves an A++. It is something never seen before, at least not in recent times. The music is fun, but after a while it gets annoying. Also the voices of the ""little people"" screaming when you run over them is a bit badly done. Those 2, however, are the only drawbacks I was able to find in Rock of Ages, and they are minor, they won't prevent one from having a terrific time playing Rock of Ages. I was very glad I got this game.The graphics are very detailed. One can tell that attention was given to every detail in building the environment. That makes Rock of Ages a pleasure to play and, what is even better, makes it a game enjoyable by all ages.I highly recommend this game.			"

												This is quite an interesting strategy game, in which you repeatedly fling a big rock down a hill to smash in the gate of your opponents castle. In between each roll you then set up defences and obstacles along your hill in order to slow, or destroy, the other players boulder. There are a number of types of defence units to choose from, like walls, turrets, bombs and resource farms, that can all be used in various momentum-killing combinations. On top of this you also have to decide - do you buy the new expensive wall? Or do you eschew building defences and instead spend the money on setting your boulder ablaze? The upgrades provide a bit of risk/reward. So in Rock of Ages a match will stress your strategic-thinking, time management, platforming and the actual steering a heavy rock down a hill.The game does have it's flaws, including some incredibly tedious boss battles, and none of the different systems run particularly deep. But as a whole, the game is made up of so many different game-mechanics cobbled together in such a fun way, that it is well worth having a try. I'd keep an eye out for it in the sales.			"

												While ""Rock of Ages"" tries to be a strange combo of ""Marble Madness"" and a tower defense game, the tower defense portions of the game are a bit half baked. The game basically consists of two players building defenses along a track to prevent the other from breaking down their castle doors with player controlled boulders. While this sounds good in theory, in practice the defenses are mostly so weak that PvP games usually just boil down to whoever can rush to hit the other player's door 3 times first, rendering placement of defenses mostly moot.However, I still had fun with ""Rock of Ages"" mainly because its ""Marble Madness"" portions play so well.  Barreling down a path as a boulder, avoiding obstacles, collecting keys, and crushing everything else in your wake never gets old. Plus, the single player campaign (a humorous tour through history with an incredibly well realized Terry Gilliam-esque aesthetic) is one of the most amusing and creative things I played all last year.

												Rock of Ages is a strange tower defense game of some sort: in every match you will spend your time between making a huge rock slide towards your enemy door, in order to damage it, in a platform, third person fashion, and examining the battlefield from an aerial view, to set up defenses (towers, animals, explosives, ...) against the enemy rock.In truth, the main appeal of Rock of Ages is its art style: a Monty Pythonesque adventure taking place in different time periods (Ancient Greece, the Medieval Age, Italian Renaissance, Baroque, XIXth Century), with plenty of artistic references and a catchy soundtrack.Gameplay-wise, you can choose between a singleplayer campaign and a multiplayer experience. The AI for the first trips more than once, but it can be challenging nevertheless (more specifically, your enemy will be far less elastic than you in dodging obstacles and defenses, and later elephants will stagger his/her rock ad infinitum). Aside from the campaign, you have a challenge mode too.I suggest you Rock of Ages if you are going to enjoy the artistic, pop-culture and history references, or you just enjoy a rather good indie game			"

There are a number of types of defence units to choose from, like walls, turrets, bombs and resource farms, that can all be used in various momentum-killing combinations. On top of this you also have to decide - do you buy the new expensive wall? Or do you eschew building defences and instead spend the money on setting your boulder ablaze? The upgrades provide a bit of risk/reward. So in Rock of Ages a match will stress your strategic-thinking, time management, platforming and the actual steering a heavy rock down a hill.The game does have it's flaws, including some incredibly tedious boss battles, and none of the different systems run particularly deep. But as a whole, the game is made up of so many different game-mechanics cobbled together in such a fun way, that it is well worth having a try. I'd keep an eye out for it in the sales.			"

												It's not easy to compare Rock Of Ages with anything else I've ever played. A single look at the game trailers should hint that not many games are quite as absurd and satyrical. My best attempt at a comparison would have to be a 3d version of Marble Madness with elements of Realtime Strategy. In short, players go back in history to build an obstacle course for their foe. As both players hasten to roll down the hill, they try to avoid obstacles and gather momentum in order to smash the enemy's gate and be the first to roll over their opponent. Storymode is fun and challenging on its own, but it's also a lot of fun to challenge your friends. Guaranteed to make you laugh, the Unreal Engine makes this a real joy to play!			"

												Rock of Ages is a strange tower defense game of some sort: in every match you will spend your time between making a huge rock slide towards your enemy door, in order to damage it, in a platform, third person fashion, and examining the battlefield from an aerial view, to set up defenses (towers, animals, explosives, ...) against the enemy rock.In truth, the main appeal of Rock of Ages is its art style: a Monty Pythonesque adventure taking place in different time periods (Ancient Greece, the Medieval Age, Italian Renaissance, Baroque, XIXth Century), with plenty of artistic references and a catchy soundtrack.Gameplay-wise, you can choose between a singleplayer campaign and a multiplayer experience. The AI for the first trips more than once, but it can be challenging nevertheless (more specifically, your enemy will be far less elastic than you in dodging obstacles and defenses, and later elephants will stagger his/her rock ad infinitum). Aside from the campaign, you have a challenge mode too.I suggest you Rock of Ages if you are going to enjoy the artistic, pop-culture and history references, or you just enjoy a rather good indie game			"

Even though this game looks cheesy (and at sometimes is) it really does have some humor with it. I also find it funny how it runs through different eras of times and you somewhat see time unravel. I also found in the game that the bosses were extremely hilarious, and were very unorthodox.

												It's a bit of tower defense against a giant rolling ball...Think marble madness with a bit of light humor to it.There are different game modes, but mainly two main game perspectives to play from.The first perspective is of the marble ball. Your objective is usually to reach the end of an obstacle course with enough momentum to break into the finish line. There's a few little twist to make it interesting, such as an skeeball like target at the end of the course.The second perspective is building the course. You usually given resources to build towers and other defensive structures to slow down your opponent.It's fun silly competitive game. Each match usually last less than 20 minutes. And they even have funny options for your marble ball, such one of them is just a cube.Would make for a great mobile game, but unfortunately the current player base is slim.			"

												While ""Rock of Ages"" tries to be a strange combo of ""Marble Madness"" and a tower defense game, the tower defense portions of the game are a bit half baked. The game basically consists of two players building defenses along a track to prevent the other from breaking down their castle doors with player controlled boulders. While this sounds good in theory, in practice the defenses are mostly so weak that PvP games usually just boil down to whoever can rush to hit the other player's door 3 times first, rendering placement of defenses mostly moot.However, I still had fun with ""Rock of Ages"" mainly because its ""Marble Madness"" portions play so well.  Barreling down a path as a boulder, avoiding obstacles, collecting keys, and crushing everything else in your wake never gets old. Plus, the single player campaign (a humorous tour through history with an incredibly well realized Terry Gilliam-esque aesthetic) is one of the most amusing and creative things I played all last year.

												Some of the most unique and humorous play in ""Ages"" this is one of those games that will keep you playing just one more level. You play as a giant stone ball (with various faces inscribed) and you must roll through the levels while avoiding opponent laid obstacles to stay intact enough to smash into the enemy fortress gate.  Each time your stone ball is destroyed and must be rebuilt.  You use the downtime to purchase and place defenses because your enemy is rolling his/her giant ball at your gate. The first person to break the gate and roll over the tiny person inside wins.Interspersed throughout the game are massive boss encounters such as the giant winged baby head or a giant Michealangelo's David statue (which you must of course smash in the fig leaf). This helps break up the gameplay a little with unique experiences often involving some laughs.It's a great little title that smashes art history, mythology and humor together for great fun. Can't recommend this enough at sale time. You'll always get your value's worth.			"

												A game with a visual style reminiscent of the Terry Gilliam cartoons in Monty Python's Flying Circus. In Rock of Ages, you face off against various historical nemeses, such as Vlad the Impaler and Cardinal Richelieu. It's a mix of bowling, pinball and tower defence, if that makes any sense. It has things in common with gaming classics, such as Marble Madness, in that you control a ball rolling downhill under gravity. In the case of Rock of Ages, the ball is a rock, and there are various types of rock, with power-ups to help you on your way, plus you have the ability to jump. The aim is to amass score by smashing into things, but hitting the wrong things results in the rock getting crushed and flaking into an ever smaller boulder, with less mass. It really is a lot of fun and hilariously funny at times. It even has split-screen and a competitive mode, where you can build defences to counter and block your oponent's  progress.			"

												You control a giant boulder, and run it through an obstacle course (which is constantly being upgraded by the enemy) in hopes of gathering enough speed to smash their castle's gate, and eventually shatter it. You then simply roll forward and squash the enemy commander (a famous figure from history). It's a simple enough concept, and playing it is pretty straight-forward.At the same time, the enemy has a boulder that is running through your course, and heading towards your gate. So you deploy obstacles in its path (towers, catapults, and others) to either slow down or destroy the enemy's boulder.Getting a solid hit on the enemy's gate is pretty satisfying, as keeping speed with all of the obstacles present can be a real challenge. The later levels will have you cursing. But you can do the same right back, and it is funny to see the enemy's  boulder get pushed over the side by fans or catapults.The art style is cool too, sort of like Monty Python with all the animated art figures.

												I wasn't sure if i should buy this game because the trailer makes you think its bad, real bad. I brought it regardless; one of my friends had it so we could play multiplayer. I have to say i was a very happy man; it is an incrediable game, however the campaign was quite short around 4 hours if you don't bother gatting all the keys. There are plenty of other activitys to do after though, multiplayer and singleplayer minigames.This is a quality game ive spend much more and recieved much less, so go, spend your do and buy it now			"

												I'd say that this game rocks, but that'd be going for the obvious pun. It's a game worthy of the ages- I'll shut up now.This game is pretty simple; you roll down a hill and wreck things to ultimately kill somebody with a giant rock. If you're a fan of Super Monkey Ball and silly gameplay then this is probably something I'd reccomend.			"

												In rock of ages you switch between rolling a huge boulder against the enemy gate and building up your defenses to prevent the enemy boulder from doing the same to you. preventing only comes very late in the game with the most powerful defenses, until then its mostly trying to slow down the enemy as much as possible so that you are the first to crash their gate and roll them over. in between missions in singleplayer there are short cutscenes where historical figures and pop culture references are mixed together while having the artstlye of the specific time, this only serves for amusement and to introduce the new enemy though there is no higher plot. contentwise you cant really get more than 7 hours out of the campaign. even when going the completionist approach and collecting all keys (and some of those are a ♥♥♥♥♥ to get) The campaign contains 23 missions, 3 of which are bossfights. there is a bunch of different turrets that have 3 levels. this is not a normal tower defense though, since you are just fighting one boulder, which can also just crush everything you built. there is also 5 types of boulders that still come down to crush everything then crush the gate.  Still this is a fun game that I'd say is easyly worth 5 dollars. I can only speak for the campaign though, because I havent tried any other mode.			"

												Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.Gameplay: Man, Atlus sure does publish a lot of weird games. This game is no exception to that. Rock of Ages is a game where you roll a boulder down a hill at a tower gate and try to break in; most commonly requiring three boulders; although requiring four if any one boulder gets particularly roughed up. This roughing up comes from the placement of towers in the pre-rolling phase that both you and your opponent go through. Yes, this is a tower defense game technically, but don't think you can win on strategy alone. It certainly helps; especially in a resistance-based setup involving the world's supply of Ballistae and stone towers, but there's more often than not a crafty way of bypassing these cheap setups with some crafty platforming.One of the things that you'll learn while playing this game is that keyboard control is only half the story. Your main method of steering the ball is with the mouse, which feels quite natural and works well. The boulder, as one can imagine, has quite a bit of inertia to it, so you have to plan accordingly for harsh turns. You can see a mirror reflection of the stage on your side, but you cannot see the enemy's side apart from when you are rolling. While I would've liked an outline map of the other side, it's not too big of a deal. The stages themselves can either be as simple as a straight line or a simple one turn spiral down or as complex as a multi-leveled complex of paths. There are some shortcuts that you can take throughout the stages; some are easy to defend against, while some are more difficult, if not impossible. Nevertheless, you have access to the same shortcuts, so it remains fair.This is one of the easier Atlus games that I've played, and the average player will find a reasonable difficulty curve to it. I have noticed a weird AI bug that came up a couple of times where the opponent got stuck in a reset loop, thus throwing the match. I'm not too sure on what causes that, as I have tried to replicate the bug, but to no avail. When the AI doesn't throw a match, however, you'll find that they are pretty decent at setting up their defenses and breaking through yours. There are boss fights in this game, but they're definitely not highlights. I've talked in the past about games that don't really need boss fights but still have them, and this is one of those games. They're not bad by any measure; they just feel out of place.Overall, I can recommend this game well enough on the gameplay alone for providing an interesting take on the tower defense genre as well as being a pretty fun strategy game. It'd definitely be even more fun with a friend. 8/10.P.S. cool kids use the Block of AgesStory: This game has roughly the storyline of a Terry Gilliam sketch, which is basically a sentient rock and his buddy travel through the years to become the best rock. Each stage has their own intro, which can be a groan-worthy reference to a meme, a very loose reference to an historical event, or just a general bout of silliness. Nevertheless, the ones that weren't solely based on predictable memes did get a laugh out of me. The cutscenes are worth a watch; that's for sure. 7/10.Graphics: The comedic nature of this game certainly does not stop with the writing. Remember the Terry Gilliam comparison? Pretty much all of the cutscenes in the game are done in Gilliam's style. The stages themselves have a very ""painted"" feel to them, and the skyboxes can be absolutely gorgeous with the lighting working with the paintings in the skybox perfectly. All of the characters are basically ripped from classical paintings, but it all feels consistent in the very weird (and very good) visual design of the game. Regarding the technical aspects of the game, it does run with minimal impact on my system at 1080p max settings at 60FPS. Shadows do that weird thing where it looks like blinds have been cast, which can be a bit distracting at times, but other than that, the game runs well enough. I'd imagine that a low end graphics card or maybe even one of the newer integrated graphics chips could run this game perfectly. 4/5.Sound: I'm not an expert on classical music (nor do I claim to be), but I do recognize a couple of songs in this game, and that leads me to believe that the soundtrack is almost entirely non-original. That's not a bad thing, though; it fits very well and is often comically overdone for the scenario. The stage music does feel like something from the period that you're in, so that's something. There's no voiceacting, apart from some random mumbling and comically cliched screams. Again, the audio helps propel the very silly nature of this game. Even though it's not all original music, it fits well enough that I can still give the audio a 4/5.Overall scores are 8/7/4/4; cumulative score of 7.7/10. Definitely worth the buy and definitely worth playing with a friend. You're sure to have a good time.			"

												I bet you've never played a game as weird and off the wall as this one. Sure, you may have seen your fair share Japanese zombie dating sims, but that is case a of cultural difference. This game, is really, very, extremely weird. Rock of Ages is a bizarre mix of platforming and tactics. You play as Sisyphus, a former king from Greek mythology who trapped in hell, where he is doomed to roll a boulder up a hill, only to see it roll down again time and time again. One day though, Sisyphus snaps and he is done with his torture. He takes his boulder and rolls it over Hades, promptly killing him and he immediately escapes Hell. So begins the destruction of the entire history of europe as you roll your boulder over famous names like Charlemange, Napoleon, Leonidas and even Gods and Angels. You play the game like you play Monkey Ball. You roll a ball down the hill. You can control the ball, and you can make it jump. The goal is to smash the enemy's gate, while you try to stop the enemy from smashing your gate. You can do this by building obstacles in your opponents path. Obstacles like fortress towers, siege equipment, cow launchers, explosive barrels and elephant soldiers. All in all, the game itself is rather simple in its execution. It is the presentation that sells it.Talk about creative use of preexisting material. The entire artsyle is based on classical, antique, medieval, renaissance, and enlightenment paintings. The soundtrack is comprised of geniously remixed versions of classical pieces by Mozart, Beethoven and others. The sheer outlandishness of the style will take you by surprise and will keep you entertained throughout the entire length of the game. Which isn't all too long, unless you go full masochist and try to collect all hidden items. Or you can indulge in multiplayer duels. That's nice and all, but I think this game is so silly you should just try it for kicks.			"

My favorites are La Boulet Des Combattants, Saturn Dies Irae, Medieval Vlad and Plague, Sisyphus Escapes From Hades, Agamemnon's Army, and good ol' Grand Finale. And also, you don't almost no games with a Titan lord as the main enemy. 10/10 would buy again			"

												You might have played tower defense games like Kingdom Rush.  You might have played reverse tower defense games like Anomaly: Warzone Earth.  But have you played one that has both?  That's what Rock of Ages is about.  In each level, you control a boulder and the objective is to knock down the enemy's gates by repeatedly running your rock into it.  The problem is that to get there, not only do you have to navigate your boulder through a winding course in a physics-based game, the enemy is continuously setting up devices to block your way such as catapults and elephants with stone towers on their backs.  If your rock is damaged enough, it loses mass and will do less damage to the gate and if it's damaged even more, it can eventually break apart.  Not only that, but you have your own gate and the enemy has his own boulder.  So now you have a tower defense game, reverse tower defense game, and a racing game all packaged up into one as you and your opponent are trying to outdo each other in defenses while trying to destroy each other's gates as fast as possible.  This was a surprisingly fun game with many unique levels and ideas that gets even better with the fact that it has not only online multiplayer but local as well.  It also helps that the campaign story has a great sense of humor.			"

												This certainly was a unique game. Art style and art direction took a turn for the humourously surreal. Gameplay is simple to learn but there are some difficulty spikes every now and then (if you don't know how to roll a ball down a hill, now would be the right time to start learning.) and choosing the boulder you will use will sometimes result in added artificial difficulty. Rolling cubes down hills, very difficult stuff right there.I enjoyed the ride and i'll play it again as soon as the fever dreams end.10/10 would roll you down a hill.			"

												I have not yet played the multiplayer option, but I can say that I was incredibly surprised from even the start of the game. Rarely do game trailers accurately reflect the hilarity and fun factor of a game, so I did not expect anything like what the trailer shows. Boy, was I wrong about this one. This game is simply incredible. Hilarious, one of the best soundtracks of any indie game I've ever played, and clearly inspired by the animations that are everpresent in Monty Python's Flying Circus episodes and beyond. At twice the price, this game would be a good buy, at the regular price, it's a downright bargain. I think that this game would be much more popular if there was some way for people to know what they're getting into. This is hilarity and fun at its finest. My only, very minor complaint is that the controls can be a little bit difficult. However, you're guiding a giant boulder, so I weigh in on that as being built in to make the game challenging. Less than an hour in and, already, it's one of my favorite indie games. This is really saying something, at least for me. 9.5/10 - I simply will not have a better time than I have in just a half hour of playing this game. Fun, fun, fun, fun, hilarious, and fun.			"

												This is definately a strange concept for a game. You play as a rock, smashing things and you compete with some historic figures who also has a rock and you try to smash the others fortress gates. You can choose to place traps, obstacles and other annoyances along the way to stop the opponents rock from reaching your fortress. And of course he does the same!It has a good sense of humor, it had me giggling a lot. I especially love that the rock shouts in terror if you fall off a cliff! It's easy to understand the tutorial and learn the game, though placing the traps in a good place is a learning process. But thankfully you get to see a camera view of the opponents rock going towards your fortess, so you can tell what parts is too easy.You also have a lot of fun things to annoy your opponent with. My personal favorite is spamming the board with cows.I have to say it... this game Rocks!			"

												A really great idea for a game wrapped in a hilarious setting with Pythonesque cutscenes. The gameplay is really interesting, switching between rolling a rock down a twisting path to reach the bottom and smash a door, while taking as little damage as possible, then setting up obstacles for your opponent's rock and trying to hit them with projectiles. The story levels take about 3 hours, and is mostly fun but have mediocre bosses, and you can also play online with other people - however I have not touched this so I do not know how it runs or how full/empty the server is.

												As a Christmas present from my brother, I could easily assume that: a) he bought it because he thought I'd like it, b) wanted to buy me the game to see if it was good enough for him to buy or c) was a game he thought HE would like so that automatically meant I would like it for some reason; therefore, I initially wondered if I'd even enjoy ""Rock of Ages"".Well, I DO like it. In fact, I love it!The principle is simple: Roll a giant boulder down a hill and break down your opponent's barricade before they do the same thing to you. It also has a convenient 'skee-ball' mode.While optimally enjoyed in short bursts of play, ""Rock of Ages"" can be surprisingly intense. The ""Monty Python"" style of humor keeps the simplistic gameplay from getting too stale or boring and the graphics are not only clever but implemented very well. The storyline is entertaining and even gives you a bit of a contrived history lesson.You'll get plenty of LOL's playing this one. It's a gem of a time-waster.			"

												Rock of Ages sure was an interesting, yet oddly very fun, experience. Let me re-emphasis the part when I said this game is odd. This game had me laughing and raising my eyebrow in question most likely every cutscene and level.Honestly this is a ""Get the 'marble' to the goal and avoid obstacles"" type of game, yet Rock of Ages just makes that type of game very enjoyable. The player must  roll their Rock down a variety of somewhat challenging maps, while the opponent tries to defend his/her pathway to the castle gate. While the oppenent is also trying to reach the player's gates, one must defend their pathway. The boss battles were fun, yet the boss battles didn't seem to get more challenging as I reached near the end of the game. There was only 4 boss battles, making this game feel sort of shor in Single Player. I haven't even checked out the Multiplayer yet.  Overall this game was a fun to play.			"

												Crush all the things!Rock of ages takes you on an adventure through a parallel history in which Sisyphus, the man doomed to roll a stone up a hill for all eternity, finally gets fed up with his punishment and rebels. After breaking out of Hades and into the mortal world, he begins using his mighty boulder to crush all who stand in his way. Along his way he crushes fellow rock collectors Cronos, Vlad Tepes, Charlemange and Leonidas.It's a simple idea but it's a very fun game.Buy if you love smashing things with boulders and squashing the kings of history as they scream like little girls.75 Rocks / 100.

												Reasons to buy RoA:1. It's a game where you ♥♥♥♥ up plenty of historical figures with a boulder.2. Controls well and has some fun multiplayer modes.3. It's $10 (or less depending on when you read this!)4. No, seriously, run Marie Antoinette over with a mother♥♥♥♥ing chunk of rock.5. I cannot state this enough, you bust the ♥♥♥♥ out of Hades with a boulder and ruin history.6. It's like Drive Angry except Nic Cage is a mother♥♥♥♥ing boulder. How much clearer can I get?7.

												This game is definitely worth a purchase if you want a game to play with a friend. The single player, while good, doesn't hold your attention for very long. It's really just roll down the hill over and over again on different maps. But the unusual mechanics and light-hearted nayure of the game make it perfect to play with someone else.			"

												In all my years of playing games, I have never encountered one quite like this. Rock of Ages is a really unique game that takes you throughout parts of european history and pits you in a bowling match against many famous characters. Sounds...bizarre, right? Well, that's because it is. If you haven't picked it up I would definitely recommend that you do (especially on a sale.) Pros:+good sense of humor+interesting story+Bowling!+very unique gameplayCons:-does seem to get somewhat repetative-other game modes provide a minimal amount of fun-boss fights are too simplistic Overall: 7.5/10 "

												People told me this game was fun. And it was.""Rock of Ages"" is a half-strategy, half-reflex and speed reliant destruction game, where you build defenses to protect your gate, while also trying to hit your opponent's gate with as much force with your boulder as you can. And it's really fun! The controls are smooth, the level layout accomodates the different strategy and action playstyles, and the enemy AI can be pretty relentless during some levels. It's a nice blend of challenge and fun.However, there are some problems. While I enjoyed the cutscenes, some of the jokes presented fell flat or got old very fast. Like the girly shrieks your enemy would cry before you'd flatten them. Or the pop-culture jokes that were shoved in here and there. The animation and style are great, but I didn't like the humor that much.On top of that, while the graphics look fantastic in this game... the color pallette isn't the most spectacular. There's some good crimsons and golds and crimsons and greens for certain levels, but there are some that are really dirty, unpleasant pallettes like blue and gold that just aren't that colorful. But, again, that's my own taste.And finally, the game can be a little TOO easy sometimes. Some levels I got through in one try, because their structure didn't stump me, but f***ed the living daylights out of the enemy's AI. And the bosses, while creative, are all very simplistic and really REALLY easy. You literally cannot die when fighting a boss, and the structure is find the weak spot then hit it three times. Despite its flaws, I really enjoyed playing Rock of Ages, and earning what achievements I did. It's addicting fun you can get hooked on for a good weekend or so. And I'm giving Rock of Ages a 7/10.

												I had a surprising amount of fun with this little game. Yes, the game is about rolling a boulder down a hill to break down a gate, but what seperates this game from other (rolling the ball down the hill ?) games is the art direction, style, and humor which reminds me of the old Monty Python and the Flying Circus skits. I played the game when it first came out and haven't touched it much after, but then the game was very easy. This would be my only complaint. They could have patched the game to change some things to make building defenses actually useful, but I can't truthfully account for the developer's actions. At 10 dollars, you can't go wrong, in my opinion with this game. It's a little ball of fun, something to make you smile and have fun while doing it.			"

												ACE Team presumably licensed Def Leppard's ""Rock of Ages,"" from their album ""Pyromania,"" to make this game, but I'm having a lot of difficulty understanding how the game relates to the song. First of all, the song's not in the game, so that's weird. Second, they appear to have taken the lesson of the four nonsense words that the song starts with (""gunter glieben glauben globen"") to mean that the dialog in the game should be gibberish. Interesting choice. Finally, in place of power chords, a strong beat you can clap to, and exciting lyrics that seem to simultaneously entreat and inspire, this game includes a rock that smashes stuff. In sum, I'm incredibly confused, but that's okay because this game is amazing. I guess you could say it ""rocks."" Rock of Ages, still rolling, rock and rolling, gets 10 out of 11 rocks.			"

Two CD's full of the all-time greats from 'On through the Night' to 'Euphoria', with the perfect mix of tracks from each album, not just concentrating on any one album.

												This game. It's easily one of the most ridiculously childishly fun games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. The sheer, simple enjoyment of rolling a big ol' boulder into something (or better yet, SOMEONE) combined with the almost Monty Python-esque slapstick humour, makes it so ridiculously funny, it's worth it just for the sake of laughing at (and with) it for an hour on end. Probably even more. And the gameplay kicks äss too! 8.9/10			"

												NO EXAGGERATION OR IRONY OR SARCASMThis is the sort of game that you can find after spending an hour going through the 200+ pages of sales.This game is love...  Ah crie over lack of trading cards. They exist now ^-^ You set up towers to defend your Gate; you command your boulder (as Sisyphus), charging through the enemy's defenses, to ultimately breach their Gate... provided you have the skillz to maneuver. If I could, I would buy this game for everybody on Steam. Alas, I only had enough for two copies, and my bro got th'other one. Please, support the ingenious minds behind this (dare I say perfect?) diversion. While you're at it, pick up God Mode (same publisher) and Zeno Clash (2) too (same developer); the former is an arena-horde survival game based in Greek Mythology, the latter is (one of) the best first-person melee games ever made and is comparably goofy to Rock of Ages (because ""WTF-esque"" isn't a proper term) . It is truly a shame that certain companies *ahem AHEEEEEMMMMUH* gouge gamers for little innovation; ATLUS has backed games/ACE has created games that I've enjoyed more, lately, than any others - to word it legibly, they're some of my (indeed, it seems) favorite games of all time.I cannot say enough good things about this game; that lack of words drove me to use, er, memes.To be sure, I want to preserve this game for as long as I can; I'm certain my playtime will run something like *Do One Mission, Don't Play Again For Two Days* just to ensure I savor it for as long as possible. To know that this game has an ending... I die.NO EXAGGERATION OR IRONY OR SARCASM; I am GENUINELY impressed with this game (perhaps even more so at how much I've allowed the game  to  impress me, not even that big a fan of Monty Python (or comparable games (is Super Monkey Ball comparable? I don't know...)(nor am I fan of bowling or tower defense; this hybrid though))...).			"

												It can be fun in short sessions. The idea is to roll your boulder to the enemy base and destroy the door before he breaks down yours. There's a little bit of strategy involved; the game lets you place things like buildings and cows on the map to stop or slow down the boulder (if you aren't careful your boulder will also stop dead in its tracks). It's a very simple idea and it gets the job done. But I did expect a little more from the guys from Zeno Clash. It's not a bad game; it definitely has its moments (the graphics and sounds are great, for example), but not enough to keep me interested for hours.[Rating: 74/100]			"

Premise is great, execution is bad.The goal of the game is to roll down a track (where your opponent can place tower defence style traps to slow you) and smash down the enemy door to win.The core issue is no matter how much you chip away their boulder to make it smaller or they chip away yours it seems to take 3 to 4 hits to a door regardless of your rocks size. This in turn makes most of the tower defence aspects laughable.After you learn of this critical balance issue in multiplayer it becomes a mad dash race to the finish and the actual tactics of defence building serves no point.

												It was on sale for a $1 or $2 and I decided to try it. Most of the negative statements made by other reviewers are correct, this game gets dull quick. What caught my inteterst in deciding to buy this were the boss fights but they felt too easy to conquer and not much thought put into them except for two bosses but yet still easily doable. It was a good idea of a game but I think if it function differently it would of been a fantastic game. Do yourself a favor and wait for the deal, if still interested.			"

												Roll down a hill and try to destroy things, but don't slow down too much or you will not do enough damage to the door at the end of the pathway. You play against an AI that is trying to destroy your fortifications meanwhile you try to destory his, first to break open the door and the end of the other person's path wins, and gets to watch their opponent crushed by a giant ball with a face on it.Interesting concept, would roll and crush cows again.

You can easily make defences that are good my just adding a 2 tile thick wall of war elaphants! and ontop of all that its 15 dollars! like seriously! it should be at most a 5 dollar game! otherwise its not worth it.

												Purchased this game after watching many lets plays of it and was really excited to see it on the steam sale for only 4.99. Downloaded the game only to find out the game has had many issues with getting the game to even start. So the long and the short of this is I not only spent 5 dollars for a game that doesn't work but I also spent three hours trying to trouble shoot only to find out it wasn't worth the 5 dollars or my time. The game looks fun but if they can't fix this major issue than there is no point buying it			"

												I had a long think about this one but ultimately chose not to recommend. The reason is the game just doesn't change enough as you progress. The first few levels were OK but it was extremely repetitive and not in a good way. As the difficulty increased so did my frustration. The map changes each level an you have to spend a run or two to figure out the paths and shortcuts along the way. This means you generally lose the first three times you play it. Of course the AI knows exactly where all the shortcuts and cheats are so it blocks you from taking them, but as you are still learning the map you make a lot of mistakes.I played for nearly two hours and am done with it.

												A really sub-par game, I seriously don't understand why the there are so many positive reviews. Basically, if you play the first level of the game, you've played them all. People keep saying ""Monty Python-esque"" but I don't see it. I suppose if you think Monty Python's humor was solely based on using historical paintings to make ♥♥♥♥♥♥ jokes, then you would consider this game to be very Monty Python. The gameplay is pretty basic: you control a boulder and you try to roll it towards the enemy's castle. Defenses are placed in your way to slow and destroy your boulder. The game is also a race, the enemy also is trying to destroy your castle's gates and you place defenses to slow the enemy boulder. Sounds fun, right? Defenses are pretty flimsy and easy to get around, so when facing the AI's boulder, all you really have to do is make a few choke points. So as a tower defense, its really ♥♥♥♥ing poorly designed.  There aren't any punishments for falling off the stage, so the player is prertty free to go as fast as possible, and take large leaps across the map, making any defenses placed by the AI completely useless. Controlling the boulder is pretty easy so there's no real challenge in making these leaps above defenses. The game becomes super repetitve and there aren't any rewards for the player. Sure, you get to watch a silly cinematic, but on the whole, they're really ♥♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												I was intrigued and somewhat excited by the trailer of the game, so I gave it a try.Unfortunately for me, I tried the first level using mouse and keyboard and I wasn't able to properly control the rock, not to mention complete the level. After moving to the gamepad the game felt a little better and I found rolling the rock challenging enough for my (average) reflexes.But when the gameplay expanded to include building towers, I felt overwhelmed and not that excited about. It's not that the game is bad or something, just that it is definitely not for me.			"

												This game caused my computer to crash every single time that I attempted to play it. I tried numerous times, and on each occasion, the game would freeze and I would be incapable of exiting it, going to task manager, or even shutting down my computer. I uninstalled it so as not to waste time. I'm sure that if the game actually works for you, you'll have a good time, but I couldn't recommend a game that didn't function as intended.			"

												This one is like a weird racing game. For those who enjoy racing games, especially where there are obstacles and also things you need to run over with your vehicle, this might be a good game for you. I'm not really a racing fan, though, and didn't realize quite what the gameplay would be like when I decided to try it on a steam sale. The rock is not easy to steer and I wasn't having enough fun to put in the amount of practice that would be needed to get better at it.			"

												I really had high hopes when I bought this game. Sadly, the camera angles during gameplay are so bad, I can't see where I'm rolling. I've rebinded my keys and it still doesn't help me see. As soon as I jump, there goes the camera and any enjoyment I had. The art and level designs are nice, but this is just unplayable for me. I'll update if I have any luck in this mess.			"

												I hate to leave negative reviews, because I've played a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥ games on steam, and hav'nt even bothered to review them.This game could have been amazing, because it has that arcade feel to it, (thanks ATLUS) but unfortunately the Single player is just wrong. You have a minute of super monkey ball fun then it becomes a tedious tower defence with poor controls and no control over the ai launching attacks faster than you at the same time. The game would have been really fun if it was:1: The levels get harder to navigate but you can still roll and build up points/levels2: No poorly implemented tower defence aspect3: AI building faster and better than a C&C hack "

Perhaps I didn't give the game enough of a chance, but my patience ran out.Pros: Interesting art style.  Unique gameplay. Multiplayer mode.Cons: The game became frustratingly difficult quickly.  I feel like there isn't any real information provided about the tower-defense portion of the game, so everything is trial and error.TL;DR: Interesting concept, not for me or, I would think, most people.

												Neat Idea, but executed poorly. Think of a tower defense where you can just go around the defense unharmed. That's Rock Of Ages. The multiplayer would be fun, but the problem is the lack of money, tiles for unit placement, and viable strats are very few and far between. The different rocks are worthless for the most part, and there is too many useless units you can place down on the ground. Single player story is funny, but it's the same thing over and over. Boss fights are pretty lack luster as well. Sadly the only thing this game has in common with Zeno Clash is the music. While it is not as memorable, you can still hear those jungle ♥♥♥ beats. Wait for a sale if you are interested. There's just better games out there.			"

												At first blush, this game appears to be good, wacky, irreverent fun somewhat in the vein of Monty Python. The gameplay is full of original concepts you will find quite literally nowhere else, and I admit, at first I was gripped.The honeymoon period, however, wears off quickly, as the game begins to throw more and more unfair, unbalanced tripe unintuitive gameplay elements that weaken the core experience, and the single-player mode drags fairly quickly; there's only so much some quick satire of history can do for me.If you can pick this up for a song, go for it, but don't expect it to entertain you long. It's a neat experiment, but ultimately I don't feel that it's one that succeeded.			"

												A historically accurate 1v1 tower defense game where you control a boulder using the rolling physics to maneuver the boulder to bust down the enemy gate's HP while also defending your own gate's HP. I found it fun for a short while before quitting due to lack of interest as it can get pretty repetitious because for the most part you're basically just maneuvering a boulder through or around the enemey's tower placements with jumps and the basic movement controls, though the boulders can come in different variations within the match you're currently in should you purchase them with the money you earned destroying structures and smothering people.

Not because it's not fun (it is!) not because it's not clever and witty and funny (it's totally all 3!) but because it is such a royal pain to try and play thanks to the attached DRM connection requirements. It does NOT run through Steam and instead requires an outside connection to the developer's servers which work spottily if at all.

												So I tried this game back on the Ps3 and didn't like it. I didn't remember why though and saw this for like a buck and thought i'd give it another go.Now I remember!The humour is nothing like Monty Python because it would have to be funny. This humour consists of fart jokes and refrences ala 'Epic Movie'. The gameplay is the most tripe ♥♥♥♥ I have seen in quite some time. You roll a boulder down a short path and hit the other guy's door. Takes about 3 good hits. The other component is placing easy to dodge traps/barriers in the way to slow the other guy down.Sounds like it could be fun but it is poorly executed here. The story is throw-away at best.The music is non stop medevil style dance music. It gets old real fast.Pass this game up. Its not worth anything.			"

												Way too difficult to Control, not incredibly funny, Took me by surprise to have some sort of tower defence when the enemy goes up against you as well, a bit laggy, controls are WAY too sensative, I tapped the D key, nearly turned my Boulder right around, almost a complete 180. Not enough things to destroy, music is bleh, Animations are a bit Flash gamey in cutscenes. I got it for about 2 bucks on sale, Kind of wish I could get a refund, cause now I have to see this game every single time I go into my Library, but that's a Steam thing, Kind of wish there was a thing like steam bucks or something, but anyways, this game also downloaded a lot of stuff on my PC I don't think are needed to even RUN the game. So I am a bit worried, a couple of files in my Computer files named a bunch of random Letters and numbers really, Kind of scared me really.  So Let's Recap.Bleh MusicPoor Animated Cut scenesOversensative controlsUseless Tower defence system cause the CPU is cheapNot enough destructionLame comedyand non-refundable experience. (But that's Steam's Problem really, Serious Steam, Please find some way To get your customers to get refunds! Like store credit for half of what you payed for the game would be ACCEPTABLE In my book!)I do not recommend this game, some people like it, but my expierience is just terrible with this game, I beat the first level and was jumped by the whole tower defence thing, I put down as many towers as possible in tight places. The CPU Just rolled right on through them at high speed, not hitting ANY of em, so yeah, CPU Is cheap. "

												My initial disappointment over the distinct lack of Def Leppard was mollified by how insane and fun this game is.It's Marble Madness crossed with Tower Defense, with a style inspired by Terry Gilliam's Monty Python animations. If you like one or all of those things, then get this game. I'm incapable of believing that anyone could hate all of those things, because such a surfeit of darkness would pitch mankind into a global holocaust. That this hasn't happened means that this game is for everyone.Maybe it's simple, but so is chocolate, and by my doctor's grave, I'll not denounce chocolate.			"

												Ever since its original release in 2011, Rock of Ages has managed to persist in my memory. This may not sound remarkable, but consider that this was six years ago now - and also the odd fact that I never actually owned the game until recently. You see, I remember seeing its many quirky trailers, and being intrigued by its gameplay; half rolling boulders down hills and smashing your opponent’s defences (in a way that recalls the classic arcade game Marble Madness), and half tower defence simulator where you struggle to stop your opponent doing the same to you. Wrap the whole thing up in an art style and sense of humour that’s very Monty Pythonesque in its nature, and perhaps you can begin to see how it avoided being a fleeting memory, even without me ever taking to the controls to play it myselfBeing memorable in that regard is one thing, however, but until I actually played it recently the question remained – is it fun to play? Well, get past the brief but initial phase where you painfully have to work out what the heck you’re meant to be doing, and it’s certainly fun for a while. Each battle sees you face off against a different figure from history, introduced in genuinely funny cutscenes which pack in half a ton of film and pop culture references to boot; a particular highlight is Leonardo Da Vinci taking part in a total rip off of The Matrix, for instance.  What follows is the gameplay process of using a big rock to smash through their defences and eventually squish them to death, which is something that carries with it the innate sense of joy that you’d probably expect from what that sentence is describing. Indeed, for the first few levels you’ll perhaps think it’s the most genius thing that you’ve played in years – but then the cracks begin to show. For one, many of the maps you’ll be staging your attack on are just plain irritating - you’ve got some with high speed ramps and jumps that’s you’d perhaps be hoping for when it comes to seeking out high speed thrills, for sure. Yet they are accompanied by many others which are just twisty and confusing, or have architecture that saps the joy out of things. Think slowly jumping a large and clumsy boulder up a flight of stairs sound fun? If you do, you’re in for a treat - and should probably seek the help of a psychiatrist. There’s numerous occasions where you’ll most likely require more than one run through of a level just to get the sense of where you should be going, which just isn’t an optimal design choice in the slightest. Worse, however, is the AI you face off against, which only ever maxes out at the level of borderline idiotic. For example, one battle I played saw the opponent’s boulder roll around the map aimlessly after encountering a tiny set of defences it simply couldn’t work out how to pass; another saw their boulder harmlessly rub against my defensive wall for the entire length of the match, no attempt to fix the problem ever attempted. Too often the simplest of strategies that is “build a wall of towers” actually pays off, and even when you have to get a tiny bit more strategic than that I never really encountered a level that felt difficult to any great degree. The only advantage the AI seems to have over you is the ability to build seemingly endless defences that go way beyond your spending limits – yet all this does is end up creating a strange situation where is feels like the the game's being cheap and resorting to cheating, despite the fact it barely adds any real degree of difficulty.  This, in turn, means the story mode of the game (which composes the vast bulk of what’s on offer) can be completed remarkably easy – I was done and dusted in about three hours maximum. The reality is the fun and novelty that comes from boulder bashing has lost its lustre by this point regardless, especially when all the irritations and issues above have been thrown into the mix. Think online battles will breathe a new lease of life into things and keep you playing forever? Ha! Good luck – all my attempts at searching for a battle ended fruitlessly. There’s simply no-one playing any more. The question as to whether I’d recommend Rock of Ages to others, then, becomes a difficult one. None of the issues listed above destroy all your enjoyment by a long shot, but there’s no denying that they do detract from the whole experience a considerable amount. In the end, however, there’s a degree of uniqueness and a sense of joy surrounding what’s on offer here. They’re things which helped the game persist in my memory for so long, and the things which make it so it squeaks through in gaining my approval, even if it does so only by a small margin. Know what you’re getting into, or (perhaps even better) wait for a sale and pick this up on the cheap, and you’ll certainly get some fun out of it. It might not rock your world, but at points it certainly gets on a roll.			"

												Have you ever squashed Leonardo de Caprio with a giant boulder? Have you ever crushed the armies of Dracula the Bat with a huge stone? Have you ever pitted great historical legends like Susaphone of Greek Legend against the likes of Pluto and the Agronites both utilizing the power of equally large rocks? Have you ever been so historically inaccurate that you were accurate because the history books were written by the Wingardium Illumanti? Have you ever failed your history class because your teacher called you out on that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and then you dropped an exporbitant metaphoric structure on said teacher and got away with it?If you did, then you're probably the police then who are just arriving at my home to find that I'VE RIGGED THE ENTIRE BLOCK TO EXPLODE.If not, you're playing Rock of Ages, a delighfully quirky and fast paced strategy/platformer/rock-crushing simulator game and advise you to completely disregard the last paragraph or else you may be burned at the stake like that famous witch, The Crucible.

												Rock of Ages is an interesting riff on the typical strategy game. Your goal is to get your boulder to the enemies gate and crash it down. But before you control your boulder, you and your opponent are given time to set up defenses like catapults (which damage boulders) or Elephants (which can push your boulder off the map). When the set-up time expires, you can control your boulder and try to dodge your enemies defenses to get to their gate. The singleplayer campaign is split with about 90% of these ""break the opponents gate"" maps and about 10% boss battles, which really don't work as well. The game also has a 2 player VS mode, as well as a race mode where you try to get to a goal as fast as you can. The game also has a cool Monty Python animation style in its cutscenes, and it has some oddball visual humor as well. It works well in Single Player, and the AI is pretty fair, but if you want to get some more legs out of the game it's worth it to play the VS mode with a friend.			"

												They did it again! Inspiring and challenging. Hell lot of fun, yet had to laugh several times.The graphics are pretty cool. Dx9, not all textures are really sharp but it goes ok since the overall design is really impressive and never done before like this.The sound is heavy like the rock you roll. It's pretty thick, too. People everywhere make weird noises, debries flying around. Very good quality. The music tracks are great and some of them are well known orchestras.The gameplay is funny and interesting. It requires quite a bit of skill to navigate the rock through the course, I've always been a fan of games such as Marble Madness.Each run turns out differently, depending on what defense objects have been placed.In multiplayer a lot of skill is asked. Without the proper strategy and good moving abilities you can not win.I knew something good was coming.This is even more. A must have for the value if you are into indie games/core gaming.Thanks for the fun :D			"

												It's like a Monty Python journeys through art history... the game. Rock of Ages is super fun, the controls feel good and the game runs really well. The art direction and aesthetic of the game are amazing and really capture the art style of the periods you travel through. There's fun little customizations to your hero and ball, and the overall depth of the gameplay was more than I had initially anticipated. It has an enjoyable multiplayer component that feels natural and fun and not just tacked on. All this combines to create a game that is silly, light hearted and just plain enjoyable. Rock of Ages is undoubtly worth the asking price, and is a great game for any type of gamer  of any experince level, it's very approachable and easy to pick up and a lot of fun. GO BUY IT! :] "

												The game is an all-time fun game with a lot of fun twists, people to play against, and boulders. I love this game because not only can you win and be happy as hell, you can also rage about falling off the edge over 100000 times or being crushed by the giant GIANT Mammoth in certain maps or blown to bits by the Giant Cannons.However, one thing I don't like about the game is that if you want to play Multiplayer, nobody is really playing. I spent like 10 minutes in the lobby for War, trying to find someone to play against, and even playing against AI to wait, but still, nobody joined. I wish more people would play this game and play Multiplayer because honestly it's fun as hell. I hope to play against somebody one day on the game instead of having to play alone and beat Story mode over and over again.			"

												Dont´t get fooled by an unattractive title or drab gameplay trailers. This game is in fact so much fun!The core of the game revolves around controlling the boulder around (or better to say down) the map and hitting the enemy gate at the end. Simple right? Actual strategic skill and planning take place very soon, when you are able to build defensive to stop the enemy boulder from hitting your gate (and so do the enemy). There are quite a lot of maps to play, each of them require a bit diffrent style of playing (some of them you need to rush, whereas some of them require careful planning, for example). Now imagine this packed into a satiric story with hillarious art style, animations and historical references and you get extremely enjoyable single player experience.Now consider everything already mentioned, add another game modes - skee boulder, where you collect points by hitting objects and try to finish faster then your opponent with scoring high multiplier on the target board, or obstacle course, in which you try to get to the end faster avoiding the defensives that AI builds - bring your friend - and prepare to be suprised how much enjoyment will the game give you.Sure, (almost) nothing is perfect and you will experience some minor bugs (nothing gamechanging, really) or get stucked from to time on the loading screen. Game will get repetitive after some time. But that won´t stop you to come back to laugh over it with your friend or solo.Worth trying if you are interested in single player, a must-have if you have someone to play with.***** 8/10***** 80% "

												The world premier virtual bowling tower defence where you get to flatten historical figures and battle mythological beasts. It also boasts a very much Monty Python inspired aesthetic and sense of humor. The challenging campaign is enough to keep the ""just one more"" attitude. While I haven't tried the online multiplayer or the split screen mode, I have had a go at the alternate gamemodes and found them a nice distraction from the main game. The game also allows for you to play as any historical figure you have defeated and use a variety of different bolders, my favourite is the Block of Ages. All in all the game has a challenging and interresting campaign, with the welcome option of multiplayer.			"

Essentially you roll your boulder down a hill to smash it into the enemies gates. whilst yor minions are making you a boulder, you can set up defenses to try and smash the enemy's gate. It's a lot better with a controller, which I have still yet to buy,  but I'm really enjoying it so far.			"

												A very enjoyable, funny, strategy game. Very fun on both singleplayer and multiplayer, however the AI can be a bit easy. The main concept of the game is that there are 2 players, each with their own half of the map. While your boulder is being constructed you can spend money on different defenses to ensure that it is not easy for the other player to send their boulder down to your castle doors and destroy them and kill you, winning the game. When the boulder is constructed you can spend further money on different boulders which have their own unique abilities or use the most basic boulder for no cost. On your way down the map you can destroy enemy defenses and other obstacles to gain money but this will deplete your boulder's strength, making it less effective against the enemy gates. 8/10			"

												They did it again! Inspiring and challenging. Hell lot of fun, yet had to laugh several times.The graphics are pretty cool. Dx9, not all textures are really sharp but it goes ok since the overall design is really impressive and never done before like this.The sound is heavy like the rock you roll. It's pretty thick, too. People everywhere make weird noises, debries flying around. Very good quality. The music tracks are great and some of them are well known orchestras.The gameplay is funny and interesting. It requires quite a bit of skill to navigate the rock through the course, I've always been a fan of games such as Marble Madness.Each run turns out differently, depending on what defense objects have been placed.In multiplayer a lot of skill is asked. Without the proper strategy and good moving abilities you can not win.I knew something good was coming.This is even more. A must have for the value if you are into indie games/core gaming.Thanks for the fun :D			"

												This game is simply amazing. You play as a giant rock, the goal is to slam into the enemy castle door as hard as you can, while building tower defensy structures to prevent the enemy from doing the same. You roll trough the ages, every chapter brings you to a new era of human history, the twist is everything is represented in the art style of the time. From ancient greeks to rococo, with music to match. The cutscenes are also hilarious. And you get to fight historical figures, real and fictionnal.Get it.			"

												A strange mix of tower defense with a racing game. Its fun, different, and hilarious. Why isn't this game more loved? No really, it's an awesome game that I haven't seen anywhere else.Pros: Its a two sided war where each player starts off with the same money. You quickly have to build a defense to protect your castle. Then after a period of time, you become the boulder to smash the other player's castle. The faster you smash the castle, or die, the faster you can build more defense to defend your own castle. I also liked the different themes the game has, and numbers movie references (Such as 300, matrix, and monty python). Also, it is funny. Very funny. I love this game.Cons: There isn't enough people playing this game. This needs to be fixed immediately. Need a pretty decent computer. Older models might struggle a bit.			"

I gave the game another chance. and the results:[+] I enjoyed playing the time-trial mode,[+] I also enjoyed collecting keys, and the achievements,[+] more than 30 unique levels to be played [-] I still didn't enjoy playin the story mode, [-] >30 levels in the story mode,[-] no multiplayer online,.[-] =/= 100%Overall actually the game is not that bad.

												Pretty fun little racing game.  ACE did a great job with the settings for each chapter and you get a short history lesson during the course of the game.  It's not a very long single-player campaign, but the game modes outside of the campaign along with the achievements should add a little more playtime.This is a big departure from ACE's first outing, Zeno Clash.  They've done pretty well transitioning from a shooter to a racing game.  I wish there was more to say but it's just a short racing game at its heart.			"

												Rock of Ages is a combination of both ball rolling and tower defense with silly humor thrown in. The game plays by giving offense and defense. The offense is rolling a ball, while the defense is setting up structures that will try and stop the opponent. The result is a fun game with a balance on tactics and skill. The game also sports a silly style as shown through the cutscenes. Each historical figure recieves a Pythonesque treatment with cutout graphics and crude animation and almost nonsensical situations. Art periods are spanned, from Greek to Rococo. The style of cutting out historical paintings and drawings is the basis of the game's graphics for 2d pieces, though in gameplay, well made 3d models are used that mimic the art period. Music is mostly famous clasical pieces and original tracks to compliment the historical theme of the game. In addition, extra modes such as Skeeball and Online multiplayer provide extra playability to the game's core. Rock of Ages is a game to enjoy!			"

												Rock of Ages is a unique game with more to offer in fun and challenge than you may expect. I really enjoy its silly sense of humor. That sense of humor takes the edge off of what would sometimes be too frustrating of a challenge. The game starts off relatively easy, but the difficulty ramps up quickly. I haven't tried multiplayer yet, but I imagine it would be alot of fun to play this against a friend or family member.I would definitely recommend this game. It's a nice, unique addition to your games collection that probably isn't like anything else that you have.			"

												This game is spectacular! It can be frustrating at times, but that is completely nullified by the great humor, the awesome art style, and the fantastic gameplay! All in all a ""Rock-solid"" game!The gameplay involves you placing defenses down at the price of gold while your enemy does the same. Then a boulder is prepared for you to roll along the enemies path, all the way to their door, so that you may crush thine foe with a satisfying splat.10/10			"

												Rock of Ages is simple and silly, but in a good way. It feels like being dropped into the interlude of a Monty Python skit. I would recommend playing this when having a bad day. It's is amuzing and you get to roll a boulder over people and buildings. A sure release of stress.			"

												Rock of ages a great game. It has multiple fun modes and a hilarious art style that make it stand out. It came out in 2011 but it still has great graphics. The only problem is that not much people play this game so its hard to go on multiplayer. The majority of players got it in 2011 when it was on sale but this great game needs more players. The game is amazing but it can get a little repetitive.I got the game after watching Total Biscuit and Jack septic eye playing it. My final problem of the game is that it can be less enjoyable if you don't have a high end computer. It is slightly laggy and the graphics aren't as great but its still a good gameI rate it a 9/10 and all it lacks are some more players and maybe a sequel or an expansion.It is unlikely there will be a expansion since it's so old but a sequel would be great and the game would become popular quickly it is also 6.99 which is a bit expensive but if you have extra money to spend get this game its worth it.

												Archangel Michael slew a dragon, then proceeded to party down, until I flattened him with a flaming boulder/10.Easily the best historical figure flattening simulation I've ever had the pleasure of playing.  Escape hell and impose your boulder-enforced will on some of historys most memorable figures.  Either that, or run time trials with a STONE CUBE.Lots of fun.  The art style is funny - based on classical art, animated ala Monty Python, telling ridiculous stories with wry humor.  If you don't know, go find out why we all ate Robin's minstrel.It's like a racing game whose key mechanic is control lag.  That's a positive, by the way.  You are, after all, Sisyphus.The novelty may wear out, but those impossible boulder leaps and terrified squeals of epic characters still amuse. "

												A strange little game whereas you play as a rolling boulder who must breach an enemy's gate several times through an obstacle course to squish a historical figure. In between turns, you are also battlefield commander of sorts, erecting defenses such as turrets, attack cows, and bombs to harass the enemy's boulder, who is similarly rushing your leader and building defenses against you. It's pretty unique, really. There's even a side mode where you're basically playing skeeball. The general atmosphere is VERY Monty Python and I really don't have a comparison to how the game plays- it's very distinctive. Be noted, however, the game is a bit difficult and the building defenses part is not particularly interesting compared to rolling the boulder around. Still, I would recommend trying this title out.

												Prepare yourself for the journey of a lifetime.Welcome to rock of ages, a game about rolling a boulder down some... interesting places. Due to a lack of competence, I cannot say much about the difficulty of the game, but I can speak about the actual mechanics:-The game features interesting tower defense which does add to the game positively-The cinematics have an interesting art style that always keeps the viewer amused-The levels are designed with multiple routes which allow for fun gameplayIn terms of graphics, I am fairly impressed with the actual gameplay, but it seems to downsize the resolution everytime I reboot the game, which may get annoying.The controls are generally good, but occasionally tend to bug outIt is fairly fun but not something I would play for more than a couple of minutes in singleplayerThe multiplayer mode did suffer from some connection issues when I tested it, but it pretty funI would reccomend this game to anyone who likes silly things and just generally anyone.

												What can I say about this game. I didn't expect what I got...maybe that is what I should say. I purchased this game as part of a bundle and started playing it and let me tell you, it is strangely addicting. As I'm sure you're aware, you play as a boulder, rolling through a course, trying to destroy the opponent's gate first and kill them while they are trying to same to you. You lay traps for your opponent as well as they do for you, making this an oddly fun game. There are only two downfalls to this game. One, the game is, for the most part, fairly easy. Sure, it doesn't take much for one to buy and play this game but there isn't much of a challenge for those looking for it, though there is multiplayer. Second, there are collectables in this game: Keys. These keys, early on, are easy to get and put in places which you must creatively think how to get. That being said, the later keys are unfair to get, especially the one on the last level before the final boss. Overall, a solid, easy game which can be enjoyed for a few hours.			"

												A very silly and very fun game about rolling boulders on an obstacle course to destroy your opponents base. Each person places defenses to protect their base while rolling their boulder towards the other one's base. Not a complex premise, which makes it very easy to jump right in. The single player storyline is very humourous and the visuals are Monty Python-esque and quite comical. Overall, a great little game to sink a bit of time into here and there.8/10 - IT ROCKS "

												Go get your balls to the wall man.It's a satirical game where you control an upgradable ball that smashes into cows, elephans and screaming cardboard people in an attempt to reach the gate at the end of the track, break it down, and squash the enemy player, usually represented by some historical or mythological figure, hiding behind it. If you are not entirely sure if you understand what I just said, that's fine - means you don't do drugs. If you do happen to look upon this game while under the effect of LSD or other hallucinogenic drugs, I am sure it will all make sense to you.The game mechanics are quite clever. 2 tracks, each with some branching. A gate on each end. Behind the gate - the player. Each player has a ball they must roll through the enemy track and hit the enemy gate with as much force as possible. Defence structures on the track damage the ball, breaking off it's mass. When the ball is destroyed or reaches the gate at the end, the player has some time before a new one is built to reinforce their track with defensive structures. A game ends when one player crushes another's gate and rolls over their avatar behind it.This is a fun game to play at parties, especially if you are short on weed or value your health yet still want to f*ck with people's minds. Also if you think a 4 ton stone boulder can squash a cow - you are wrong. Cow>stone. OOOOOOOOOO/10(those are balls)If this game was an accurate representation of history, it would be a pretty good representation.			"

												This game is full of charm, its not the best game ever made but it was enjoyable in small doses. The developers behind this game are very creative and full of imagination and that to me is the most important part in video game development. As much as I enjoyed rock of ages, it is still nowhere near as immersive or as engrossing as Zeno clash, the fps brawler they made before this game. I give this game a 7/10 for innovation and imagination and its price tag, I would give it more but the repetitive gameplay only allowed me to enjoy it in small doses. I am looking forward to future projects from ACE team.			"

												This is probably the second best comedy Video Game I've played (Borderlands series being 1st on the list). It has a playstyle I've never seen, the art is great, and the cutscenes are pure gold  xDIf only more people played it though, the multiplayer is fun.I recommend this game to anyone and everyone-9.5/10  (-0.5 due to lack of players)			"

												This game is awesome! If you want the perfect multiplayer game (both local and online) to play with friends, you can't go wrong with this game. Split screen is absolutley where the game shines though, nothing beats the enjoyment you get when you totally destroy your friend and he gets red with anger. If you want to know what the game is about, or how the game works...well that's kind of hard to explain. You're basically duelling each other by sending a rock to the other player's door as hard as you can. The opposing player creates blockades to try and stop you. So there's kind of two phases you need to master, building blockades and rolling your rock to destroy your opponents door. It sounds totally crazy and weird, but that's a part of the game too. You should just buy it and play, you won't regret it.Oh, and btw, I have played this game over 30 hours on PS3, so yes, I have a lot of experience with this game, and I can tell you this game is worth your money.

												Like a lot of ACE games, Rock of Ages is a diamond in the rough, and well worth the price of admission (especially how often it's on sale and how deeply discounted).The premise is fairly simple: you roll a giant boulder through an obstacle course trying to mash in a set of gates at the opposite gate.It has a great sense of humor, interesting graphics, and mechanics that are at least something different.In my opinion the only downside is the combination of building defenses for your opponent along with trying to run through theirs: you can only place obstacles while you're waiting for your next boulder and this is also the only time you can try and pinpoint-catapult the enemy. Annoyingly, the computer opponents in single player seem to be able to catapult you the entire time (because of course) and have ridiculous accuracy, which can be frustrating.So it's not perfect, but it's often only a few dollars, and is easily worth that, if not quite a few more.

												DEFINITIVE / GALLERYPOSITIVES:- hearty chuckle worthy mini scenes at the beginning of every level. - lots of visual, weapon, and level variety. - though challenging/frustrating at first, the inevitable thrill of momentum and mighty destruction is unparralled and worth the endurance/patience. - lots of replayablility because of the multiplayer features.Seemingly silly, the experience is surprisingly epic. Though we all have certain times we like to reflect on respectfully, this is a great reminder that on the grand scheme of things, everything is ridiculous.			"

												Rock of Ages is a platformer/race/tower defense game where you control a ball similar to games like Torquing (Funorb), Super Monkey Ball and various recent marble/ball themed puzzle games on Steam.The game is a bit silly and sometimes frustrating, but otherwise a very fun game that makes you feel achieved after beating it's challenges. It has some replayability, but (in my opinion) only in co-op as there aren't almost any players online..  and the local co-op sadly requires 2 controllers.9/10			"

												I personally like to call this game of Monty Python: The Game, mostly due to it's visual style and sense of humor, in this game you take control of a giant boulder and use it to crush your enemies, all while having to build your own defenses to protect yourself from your oponent's ball of stone, it can be a bit frustrating at times but still a very pleasant experience.

												rock of ages is about you a rock that goes though history killing the enemy. The controls are easy with the w a s d to move rock and mose to move camera. You pretty much have to blow up the other person gate before they blow yours up. Also need to collect keys to unlock the bosses so you can go to the next lot of levels. all in all it is a good game and most of the time it is in sale so buy when in sale.the game is about 5 hours long . The last level is called saturday which i found hard all in all was a good game short, cheap and money well spent ooo yeah			"
