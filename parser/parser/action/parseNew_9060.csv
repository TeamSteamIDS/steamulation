												A classic from the Golden Age of PC gaming; Hexen II is a dark fantasy take on the quake engine.The single player rewards skill and FPS ingenuity as you solve the mystery of a desolate land.Multiplayer has frenetic action reminiscent of the original Rise of the Triad.Steam: where is the Hexen II expansion, Portal of Praevus?

												Hexen 2 came out in 1997 and was developed by Raven on Quake 1 engine. It's mostly a single-player FPS with RPG flavor. Well, the way that it was done back in the day, not about plots but about wandering around. And it can also be played in multiplayer, both competive and cooperative. Sadly, there is no expansion pack for it in Steam, Portal of Praevus, so it's just stand-alone Hexen 2.Now, seeing how id handled this Steam release? You guessed it, no CD music! But on positive side, Hexen 2 actually had MIDI music in it as alternative. While I would recommend you to track down soundtrack or game CD, MIDI is still a fine.It also lacks intro movie, so you have to watch that yourself on YouTube.It also includes only OpenGL version of a game, there is no Software option.Otherwise, it's also kinda fine. Not sure about widescreen. It handles some HUD graphics badly on higher resolution screens, like it doesn't stretch intermission graphic fully. And then, it also kept all the original game's bugs.Boy, was that buggy. My first game-breaking bug was in the Aztec-like world, where it kept failing to load location that I visited previously properly, just erroring out. Had to restart progress there with use of console commands. And then in Egypt-like world solving clock puzzle correctly didn't open the door in another location, making it unsolvable. Yay ""noclip"" command. And in greece world it would randomly crash because fish would randomly try to do invalid behavior or something. I murdered them later.So yea, just get Hammer of Thyrion engine port. It should fix most bugs while it doesn't change the way that game looks. So purist like me will be happy.Oh, and since it's Quake 1 engine game, don't forget to input ""+mlook"" console command for mouseview!As for Multiplayer, well, it probably should work. This game screams for Cooperative gameplay with friend, I think. Even though it's still more of single-player experience. But since it has no server browser and isn't Doom/Quake, then I take it that community is ""dead"". Didn't find server with people at least.Story follows Dragon Riders saga, as you have to take on the biggest and meaniest red menace of them all. And so this time around you will have ot travel through few time periods as well, visiting dark castles, Egypt, Greece, Aztec. Hm. Well, actually you have to travel over four continents of Eidilon world. And well, just go and read the manual, find it in Internet. It's worth it.Nothing much going on in the game though. Didn't bother with special music for intermission/ending even!So, now about Hexen 2 itself. Great sequel. I actually think that it did a much better job than Hexen itself. The only thing that original has over this is a bit more colorful setting. Otherwise, Hexen 2 mostly improved and fixed some of the problems I had with original. It's more interesting and less repetetive.One of the small changes, as you would expect, are classes and leveling. There are four of them now, but they all still dare to have only 4 weapons, which is shame. But now as classes level up, they will open two additional abilities. Most of which are actually pretty passive and wouldn't change your playstyle.-Paladin is mostly focused on head-on meleeing, your first hub will be spent swaying only sword. His first ability is that he swims with same speed as running, while second ability is that he may regenerade instead of dieing. So, pretty passive stuff, but still fine character.-Crusader is another head-on class, but not as focused on melee. His abilities are all focused on keeping himself alive. One ability is that he will randomly get health bonus while fighting, second ability is that enemies sometimes will drop Holy Power, to power you up for some time.-Necromancer is slow character who is stronger at range. His first ability is that health may drop from enemies. Second ability is strange, you can sometimes get health by hitting enemies with melee attack. Seeing how he is slow and weak, it's pretty much not worth it even if you are lucky.-Assassin is a weak direct damage output yet fast character. It's also supposedly stealth character. Character with freaking stealth abilities in a game where AI doesn't do anything to make them worth it! First ability is that she can become invinisble in darkness if she stands there for some time. Useless. And she can backstab enemies with her melee. Which is hard to pull off, at rare times when enemy isn't facing you. And even if backstab does few times more damage than usual melee hit, her puny melee weapon is so weak, it doesn't do anything good in the end. Just forget about abilities and concentrate on damage-avoiding playstyle.This time your character will level up as you kill more and more monsters too. Leveling up increases stats like health and mana, but you will not get to choose what to do with level-up. It's just a little thing to make killing every enemy worth it. And thankfully, it's not Hexen 1.When you compare Quake to Doom, you will notice that they focused on having less enemies in each encounter. Whether it is for the better ot not is not something easy to decide. And Hexen 2, running on Quake engine, has much less enemies per encounter than Hexen, running on Doom engine. And boy, this one is actually much more fun in this case. Combat in Hexen 1 felt too repetetive, having to kill dozen dumb monsters with 4 weapons for whole game. Hexen 2 improved it by focusing on less yet smarter or just more interesting enemies. Hexen 1 would swarm you with annoying shielding centaurs, who just dumbly walk twoard you and shield for few seconds upon any damage. Hexen 2 has shielding were-jaguars, who actively jump, run and roll around, only sometimes putting on shields, with the game throwing only around 2-3 of these dangerous tough enemies at you in same time.Not only that, but Quake engine allowed puzzles to get much more varied. Hexen 1 was about finding switches to find more switches. Hexen 2 will make you run and wander around, looking carefully at walls to see breakable ones, making you bring sand to the forge to turn it into glass or solving a time puzzle in Egypt. You can agrue that it's almost same by complexity, but it's much more interesting this way. Especially the first hub and Egypt ones, they are very mysterious. it also helps a lot that Hexen 2 is more detailed, having houses filled with furnite, for example, thus making exploration more interesting.Sometimes it lacks enough clues though, making you wander around for awhile. Or finding out that some wall was actually passable like a ghost wall. That happens. That, and it's still much much more puzzling than what most FPS players ever expect. ""Puzzling"" as in ""Where am I supposed to go next?"".Music is also pretty good. It's mostly remixed of Heretic and Hexen music made to sound more ambient. Has some good tracks of it's own.And well, while I mostly like this game a lot, it has few annoying things. One of them is physics. Player control. For some reason it feels like they wanted to appeal to Quake speeders. Diagonal running is SO much faster than just running forward, it's very noticeable. And well, I don't usually like such weird controls. But well, it's for some reason is quite addictive, as in few hours I ended up strafejumping up the slopes at high speed as a way to move between location.Well, okay, that wasn't so bad, what is actually bad are pools of water where walls aren't lowe enough. In these cases you have to gain actual speed when you reach the surface, you have to shoot yourself out instead of just climbing out, pretty much. Too challenging. Don't forget to bind ""swim up"" in controls.Also, ocassional unavoidable damage bring game down.Hexen 2 improves a lot on Hexen ideas, not being as repetitive and more fun. While you may be frustrated while playing it, once you are done, you will remember this adventure fondly.			"

												When Hexen 2 was released in 1997,  it was reviewed as a medieval fantasy reskin of Quake. After replaying it 15 years later, I just realised that the game is much more than that.PROS:+ Hub design based levels+ Incredible soundtrack; very atmospheric and dark+ 4 different settings based on medieval, ancient egypt, aztec and roman mythology+ Fluid movement mechanics (just like Quake)+ 4 classes to play : paladin, crusader, necromancer, assassin+ Some items have different effects depending on your class+ The Tome of Power not only act like a Quad Damage but also alter the attack animation and effects+ Possibility to summon a gargoyle+ Possibility to transform your foes into a vulnerable sheep+ Challenging boss fight (the Four Horsemans of Apocalypse: Death, Pestilance, Famine, War)CONS:- Extremely sadistic and confusing puzzle patterns (hidden item, switch, door, passage, etc)- No map- Bullet sponge ennemies that do not react when being hit- Only 4 weapons per class- XP system is more or less useful since the player cannot allocate any attribute points- 3D models hasn't aged well- The gibs effects are not really convincingTo summarize, Hexen 2 may not be a masterpiece but it is a worthy sequel to Hexen: Beyond Heretic and a great conclusion to the Serpent Riders saga. Nowadays we don't see games like this anymore. If only more developpers could take this approach...Rating:8.0 / 10			"

												Completed: 8/22/14 in 18 hrs.This game will only seem appealing to a narrow group of players. If you were born in the 70s or to the 80s or wish to see where the FPS genre came from, then sure. Being as I am a retro gamer; I simply love this game. Not as nostalgic as the first but gold none the less. In the early days of Quake and Doom the games were generally a one trick pony. In the Hexen and Heretic they implemented a inventory system as well as selectable character classes; something new to the genre and with this one a level up system even.It's worst flaws are the dated graphics and some of the puzzles are quite frustrating. You must pay attention to detail and remember large levels to progress in any sort of enjoyable time/manner.Steam should have the expansion... boo.			"

												On the plus side, the weapons are far less overpowered this time around, and the modified Quake engine allows for far more complex level design, on top of a 3D look that hasn't aged perfectly, but still is more pleasing to the eye than enemies that look like they're made from cardboard. They also played it up as much more of an RPG this time around, giving each class a set of visible stats that automatically level up when you've gained enough experience points from killing enemies, giving you an incentive to fight rather than just run past everything. The puzzles are also largely improved, most having solutions that don't require you to activate some unknown wall or something. No, this game will tell you, and you'll probably be able to figure it out without a guide.On the negative side, the Quake engine. While it's good to look at and everything, you'll have to do a bit of tweaking to get the resolution accurate, set mouse controls, and all that stuff, and it all has to be done manually. It's not a huge complaint, but it's just a quick pain that you have to go through whenever you install the game.Even if you weren't a fan of the previous games, I'd suggest giving this one a go.			"

												Based off of the original quake engine, Hexen II is quite stunning in both it's technical aspects and its overall appeal as a game. Continuing where the original Hexen left-off, this game adds some twist in the medival storyline, expands the Hexen universe, and provides us gamers with an easily digestable narrative. Gameplay-wise Hexen II puts an emphasis on ranged combat, but melee combat also feels very satisfying (seeming as you can decapitate and quarter your foes once they're down). The leveling system isn't robust, but because the game is more action-oriented the RPG elements are more of an addition rather than a main attraction. The wide variety of enemies and open world compliments the different classes to play as, and substantially increases the replayablility. Overall if you're on the fence about getting this classical masterpiece or if you seem vaguely interested in the vintage fps genre, GET IT!! You won't regret this purchase.			"

What I liked about the game	+Nice to see Hexen in a full 3D world. The game has brilliant and complex level design. My favourite hub was probably the first one.  	+Smart A.I. When I was using the staff and the grenades the enemies were hard to hit because they kept dodging my projectiles.   	+Hexen 2 has new classes, this time round I played as the assassin. Each class has their own unique weapons; four weapons each. The classes also have their own special ability's, for example with the assassin you can do critical damage by sneaking up on your foes. You can level up by killing enemies which increases your health and mana. There's plenty of replayability.	+There's a boss at the end of each hub, you also encounter new enemies in each hub. New powerups as well. What I disliked or was disappointed with	- Bugs and glitches. I've encountered enemies freezing and being unable to kill them.  Half way through the 2nd hub I was unable to walk backwards and use the teleporter. The last boss kept getting stuck and after I defeated him I was unable to read the story's conclusion. 	- The puzzles in hexen 2 can be very frustrating. The most frustrating hub in the whole of the Hexen series was probably the 3rd hub in Egypt; I kept getting stuck and having to resort to looking on youtube. The game is also very challenging even on normal. One of the problems I had was I used a lot of my items in the boss battles and both my mana and health were drained making the last two hubs very difficult.  	- No soundtrack.    	- Unfortunately you can't use the mouse to look up and down without pressing and keeping hold of a key. I used mouse 2 to look up and down. I couldn't find any patch or mod to fix this you will have to customize the controls first before you start. Conclusion The weakest in the series. The difficulty and the frustration of that Egypt hub ruined the game a bit for me and you also have the bugs and glitches throughout the game. I recommend you buy this game when it's heavily discounted and also I recommend you give the demo a try as well to see what I mean by the problems with the controls. It's worth giving it a try for that unique combination of FPS and puzzle solving, especially if you really enjoyed the first Hexen.     60/100(Not modded) "

												Raven put the Quake engine to good use in Hexen II, as they did with the Doom engine in the original. At the time, software rendering couldn't handle too much geometry, hence fewer monsters etc. Not everyone had 3D accelerators back then.This is a great game given the engine limitations. There are many difficult puzzles to solve, requiring you to pay attention to the surroundings and read the signs on the walls. Taking notes helps as the game can get pretty convoluted at times.Map organization isn't that much different from the original Hexen. There are several ""hubs"", each branching out into a number of interrelated maps. Be prepared to remember how to get to each of them, as some tend to be hidden away. Also bind keys to the various power-ups so they can be used quickly.The current Steam version locks the fov to 90 (whatever), and is otherwise outdated compared to a newer source port (like Hammer of Thyrion). So be sure to get that and copy the .pak files over from Steam, as there are many more configuration/graphics options available.I much prefer the self-directed, puzzle-solving approach to the more scripted type of games. Hexen II doesn't force you to watch a bunch of stupid cutscenes you could care less about, and represents a game format the industry really needs to get back to IMO. "

												HeXen II is the continuation of the slightly odd but definitely good Heretic/HeXen series, adding to Raven Software's long list of games made out of whatever technology id Software was just about done using at the time.  It's also the first one in 3D, thanks to Quake's Engine. Because of this, HeXen II is basically a cross between HeXen and Quake. If that sounds great to you, then read no more; HeXen II is for you. If you're not immediately enthused, read on.One of HeXen II's two main influences is its predecessor, HeXen: Beyond Heretic. Like HeXen, HeXen II is an Old-School FPS where you can choose one of multiple classes (4 in this case), each with 4 weapons and a different role. I tried the Necromancer and the Crusader, but was disappointed by both. I then reverted to Paladin, which is basically the Fighter from HeXen. I loved the way punching felt in HeXen, and luckily this game manages to capture that in 3D. Your character, when drawing his fists, bashes his spiked knuckles together, and the game honest-to-God just plays the sound of a rockslide when this happens. It's dumb as hell and doesn't make any sense, but it feels wonderful and I'm glad they put it in.This is by no means the only similarity the two games have, however. Most of the pickups are exactly the same, as are the inventory items. They share a grim, gothic tone, as well as the general plot about Serpent Riders. There's a hub-worlds-and puzzles structure in both as well, although HeXen II carries it out much more poorly. The devs made an effort to make the puzzles more realistic and logical, but this makes them even less intuitive. HeXen's abstract system of buttons, keys, and doors made its own simple sense, but HeXen II has...well, here's an example. For one section of the game, you need to find bone dust to complete a potion that melts mithril. You therefore need to go grave-robbing, grind up the bones you find in a mill that only opens when you find a key, take these bones to the potion to complete it, and then find a shiny door underwater and melt it to proceed. It's horribly obtuse in-game, and I required a walkthrough for pretty much the whole time. Also, sometimes puzzles elements are hidden behind secrets, which is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing to do. Not all the puzzles are this bad, and the game tries to help out with occasional text hints, but it's still pretty dumb. HeXen II tries to be HeXen again, succeeds in some ways, and fails in others.Of course, HeXen II is a lot like Quake, as well. It's 3D, of course. However, while Quake had full vertically-enabled mouselook to assist in looking and aiming in a 3D environment, HeXen II sticks to making the player use the keyboard to look up and down, as there's no vertical auto-aim either. This is very awkward, and it makes aiming at enemies above you far harder than it has to be. I'm not sure why this is the case, either, because Quake came out the year before and managed mouselook just fine. Also, like Quake, HeXen II doesn't have a map, which is really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying when Quake's intuitive linear level design is replaced with HeXen's sprawling mazes full of doors and and walls that can change at any time. There's also no use button, which I didn't really like in Quake and I don't really like here. HeXen II takes a lot of cues from Quake, but not all of them are good ones.HeXen II does have a few things of its own, though. There's a leveling system now, which is nice but ultimately unnecessary. The environments are also pleasingly destructible, at least in the first and fifth hubs. Each hub, by the way, has a different theme based on a different ancient civilization, which is a nice bit of variety from HeXen and Heretic's straight medieval fantasy. It's also quite a bit harder than both Quake and HeXen, but in that kinda annoying way where everything just has tons and tons of health and some really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tty attacks. The game's bad at telling you when you're hurt, so you can lose half your health in seconds without realizing. On the other hand, at one point a golem punched me to death and I saw a texture of my splattered guts on the wall behind me, so that's neat.Overall, HeXen II is basically fine, but it feels like it could be a lot better. There're a lot of easily fixable mistakes, like not knowing when you're hit and the lack of mouselook. Additionally, I feel like the Heretic/HeXen series works better as a sort of anthological thing, with each game being related to the others as little as possible, outside of the basic themes and Serpent Riders. A straight sequel seems like a misstep. I hear that a follow-up called Hecatomb was at one point in development, and that seems like a more logical thing to do. I'd like to see the series continued with some sort of weird melee-only RPGFPS that took place in some other setting and tone entirely. Ah, well.Anyway, as I was saying, HeXen II is basically fine. It can be frustrating and stupid often, but most of the time it's in that HeXen groove of puzzles and punching, only now in 3D. A walkthrough is basically required, but that's not a major concern in the modern age of the Internet. I give it a pretty weak recommendation, but a recommendation nonetheless.Unless, of course, you're one of those people who's delighted by the idea of a HeXen/Quake mashup. Then it's about as good a recommendation as I can give.			"

												A much greater use of the Quake 2 engine. I found Quake 2  to be grey, dull, and boring. (as revolutionary as it may have been) While the graphic aren't impressive by today's standards, I find the choppy 3d animations that have no transitions between the keyframes to be quite charming.

												The first PC game I ever fell in love with... back in the old days when a 6meg 3dfx Voodoo Banshee was an awesome video card. Buy this from Steam (also comes in an ID package with Hexen, and Heretic and some other stuff if you want), then d/l the Hammer of Thyrion/uhexen2 source patch (legal and free) from uhexen2.sourceforge.net and you'll get great resolution and a more modern default control scheme all without having to edit the .cfg or do command line stuff. I was never able to finish this back in the day. Something else always came up.  Now I can go back and finally finish it if I want. :)			"

												For an old game I never played when it was new.... it is not bad.  However.. I only played half of it.  I guess I got tired of playing it.  I imagine if I played this when it was new... It would be the most awesome.The basic idea is... wonder around killing things and solving puzzles.  However all of the puzzles are searching for hidden doors to find misc items to unlock new areas... to find more hidden doors.About half way through the game I got tired of looking for hidden doors and swinging my sword up close & getting beat up.As a technical side note: I had to use something called a source port to just play the game.  Some sort of individually made hack to allow graphic options & changes.Feels like a slow, sword swinging, Quake game.... full of hidden doors... just like Hexen one, but with less atmosphere.			"

												Quake 1 but in a medieval setting, you get to play as one of the 4 classes (one of which is the manly paladin who fights things using his fists and later, a magic-powered sword and throwing axes) that differ only a bit from each other save for their passive perks that they get by leveling (yes, it's prolly the first FPS with a leveling system).The game might feel a bit clunky for the modern gamer what with having no mouselook unless changed in the command console, blocky visuals and the fact that the areas are rather dark so i suggest getting a source port.

I wish I had played it when I was younger, I remember seeing both 1 and 2 in stores and never paying attention to them, too bad, I missed out.  I will say the puzzles are insanely hard to figure out if you are a first time player and have never read any guides or watched any gameplay videos, but it all adds to the depth and the story that is simple but nicely executed.

												HeXen II: Ode to the Last of the Serpent RaidersSomething calls me to travel again,To the perilous and wondrous lands of Thyrion.To free the world of Eidolon's bane,To prove that I am the Ancient Champion's scion.First step drenched in cold and fear,Starts in the sleepy city of Blackmarsh,Where high towers dark skies tear,And the Tailor hides a secret most harsh,There I shall find skull wizards,Spreading waste without hesitation,And even when I avoid spilling my innards,The General, Famine, is preparing plans for my extinction.Swept away, I land among the sacrificial slabs of Mazaera,Readying for another battle with were-panthers,Blood-soaked stars are pointing me to step into the dark era,Where Death awaits, offering only painful druthers.Two Generals now are crowned in dust,As I appear in the forgotten temples of Thysis,Sands of time to me are showing a gesture of trust,To the past I run, to rid myself of weakness and inner crisis.My weapons of righteousness pointed to the Mummy Lords,And Wheels of Time primed to strike in my favor,Perished evil's screams resonates as calming chords,Another General, Pestilence, acts to be a false savior.My travel leads me further to the unforgiving Academy of Septimus,Where War is the first and the last word of philosophy,Most dangerous warriors of darkness, led by Medusas,Still fail to protect their General, War, and its fleeting sovereignty.But to be played so harshly by the last General,Travelling half the world while seeking the source of Chaos,Only at the end I find that first land I've stepped in hides the Devil,This time however Eidolon shall meet my just fury's embrace.Now all evil resides as an ugly, old memory,Fair folks, just as I, return to their abode,Still a feeling of uneasiness and anticipation sometimes overwhelms me,For I know that every year, at least once, this game I shall play and download.

												The game is quite challenging for both combat and puzzles. You have to make sure not to use up too much ammo too because it can be scarce, otherwise you will be forced to use melee (either that or run away). The gameplay is a bit strange, but nonetheless its good. Unlike the previous games, this one you can set the controls in the game rather than from other programs. The mouse look is a bit weird, but i just imagine it like the first quake where i have to hold a certain button to activate mouse look. At least the game has mouse look unlike the previous (unless if played the port version of the game in the previous and most likely in this game as well so you dont have to hold the button).The enemies are indeed tough, if you are ready to fight bunch of enemies then go for it. There are enemies that would drop your hp down alot or end up killing you no matter how high your hp is (depends on difficulty, played the highest). You will start with low hp and manas. You can actually level up by killing enemies which eventually shows you leveled up, increasing your hp and mana at max after gaining a level up (pretty much like rpg games). The weapons are quite interesting, they do have classes.If you are expecting multiplayer, then you came in the wrong place. Unless you know how to do local multiplayer, then its possible. Or unless you know a way to port it, then go for it.Would recommend anyone that would like single player games and first person shooter. Because this game is really worth to pay and worth to play.

												I've been a fan of Hexen and Hexen II since my youth. I decided I'd give this game another shot and ultimately, I still think it's a pretty good game in general. It's fun to explore and the fact each classes have different weapons gives the game some replay value. Most of the puzzles in the game are reasonable although they get a little harder later in the game. The game has some pretty good music but as far as I know, it doesn't have files for CD music so it means you might be stuck with Midi. The first attempt to clear the game might take a pretty good amount of time as well so for a first person adventure game, it's length is pretty reasonable.However, this is a game I'd only recommend to people who aren't impatient. There's a fair share of exploration required to do and at times and some of the puzzles can be rather frustrating or some hints can be somewhat unclear. At some point, areas might open to continue progression but it's not always perfectly clear where you're supposed to go next. The last few worlds are particularly bad in that regard but I wouldn't say it ever gets unfair. On the other hand, I'd say Hexen did a better job in general to figure out what has to be done or at least, the exploration doesn't get as tedious. Still, anyone who's willing to explore the game and have the patience to understand the puzzles will most likely have a fun experience. Some of the areas are actually memorable with how they've been designed and I'd say the maps gets even more fun to visit as the game progresses.  "

												I played this game a lot when it came out. I must say it was a hit back then and I was rooted to my 15-inch monitor salivating profusely to the awesomness this game offered. Lush, colorful graphics, great gameplay, cool puzzles and unique weaponry made this game my favourite entertainment of 1998. Then by some terrible accident  I stomped on my CD with copy of this game and didn't finished it.  So 14 years later I spottted this game on steam an thought I would give it another try, It didn't age well. If You think about all possible nightmares of retro gaming this one has it all. Hard as hell and unforgiving in a wrong way. I can still play first Quake/Doom/DN3D without feeling cheated but this game seems to be very imbalanced. It is known for it's notorious puzzles which are very frustrating and irritating. Opponents feels sometimes awfully overpowered, especially bosses. Colors and overall graphic design seems bleak and desolate which might be intentional back then but today it just feels empty and unappealing. Apart from that overall perfomance seems to be quite choppy on lower resolutions (the way it meant ot be played by the way). If You boost the resolution up with unofficial mods it works fine but levels looks very simple and raw because texture show their age. You may think that I might be spoiled with recent AAA titles but for me it's just not that fun to play anymore. I still kinda like it for nostalgia reasons but I just can't recommend it anymore.			"

For someone that is used to the modern era of gaming and wasn't old enough to really expirence these games (I was 6 when it came out), this game is at least able to control well enough to play.I am not sure if I will continue to play yet as the story hasn't grabed me but its at least an option. Hexen 1 is a no go for me.			"

												So then. This is a best game so play it or else... YOUR DEAD! Most eventually, It's hard to do the map cheat in Hexen II. Sorry, This game is not a wad file or any other thing, It's just a hexen II, You can't play it with zandronum, skulltag, gzdoom or any other engine for The Ultimate Doom, Doom II, Final Doom, Heretic: Shadow of the serpent riders, Hexen: Beyond Heretic, Hexen: Deathkings of the dark citadel. The Hexen II Engine doesn't use wads. It uses an unknown file so most eventually if you don't like the classes then look at the main menu forever			"

												Feeling sad by writing this review but... After playing some old school shooters like Doom, Quake, Heretic and Hexen 1 itself, I cant recommend this game.PresentationThe game itself looks and plays great. It runs in an altered Quake 1 engine and is fully 3d, unlike Hexen 1, which, just like Doom, uses 2d sprites for enemies and items. I have no ploblems running this game on my machine (win. 8). The environments and enemies bring a gothic and dark feeling, with great soundtrack that emphasises the overall grim atmosphere that the game has. Just like Hexen 1 you chose a few character classes that have different weapons and use the two types of mana in different ways. Its kind of an attempt to include RPG elements in a shooter.Puzzles and ProblemsEventhough it looks and plays great, the reason why I dont recommend this game is that its virtually impossible to advance the game without some kind of guide or walkthrough. The shooting and killing is sporadic, and you will spend most of the time trying to solve hundreds of impossible puzzles, that require you to go to a certain location, pick up a hidden item, then teleport to another location, pull that lever... Its not a shooter like Quake, the devs pick up the simple puzzles from Hexen 1 and created something really annoying, that requires you to be constantly looking for answers on the internet as you just cant figure out by yourself using exploration. If you want a good fast paced shooter like Duke Nukem, Quake and Heretic, this game is not for you.Get Hexen 1, Heretic or Quake instead.			"

												An old-school Raven shooter set in the D&D universe. We're talking first-person mayhem featuring fantasy-style weaponry, an inventory with loads of deployable power-ups, and lots of head-scratching as you try to figure out where to go next. Lengthy campaign is chock-full of clever enemies and differing themes (medieval, amazonian, egyptian, greek, etc) spread out over several ""world"" hubs as you take on the horsemen of the apocalypse. There are four diverse classes with unique weapons and abilities; I went with the obvious choice, Assassin (because why wouldn't you want to play as an assassin?) and was able to complete the game on Hard without cheats save for no-clip when I couldn't get out of wells. As with lots of these older games, the final boss in unbeatable. Still, a classic FPS from the golden age of FPS. Gamers who grew up after the 90's need not apply.			"

												Poor game from a poor series.  Not worth your time or money.Get Quake instead.  It's a different genere of game but it's still manages to be better in every way.The combat in Hexen II is clunky and made difficult by the inability to freely use the mouse without holding a button.  Bugs prevented me from progressing (such as doors refusing to open as scripted).  Poor level design also caused unsolvable issues - such as jumping into a shallow pool that had a ledge higher than you could jump, permanently trapping you.At points I had to bring up the console and use 'noclip' just to get past moments that bugged.  This wasn't due to me missing  part of the puzzle either, as I referenced everything online.Literally everything, the puzzles are so obscure and without any logical context that I had to use a walkthrough for most of my playthrough.Pace is further interrupted with difficult to see switches and hidden areas that are obtusely hidden, requiring attrition and general time wasting tactics to find.There is just no flow to anything, the combat is difficult due to poor controls, the puzzles non-sensical and the level design made to waste your time.This game isn't worth anyone's time or money.  It may be very cheap, but why would you pay anything to be frustrated?I've written a more detailed review of this game and the series in General here:http://theboilingpot.net/hexen-ii/ "

												One of several games that utterly fascinated me as a child, it only barely makes it's way into my list of games I like and am willing to keep around, only because I think the paladin is awesome. I am not a fan of satanic imagery in games and have thrown away games for less than the amount of said imagery that this game throws in my face.That said, it's got a fairly solid set-up mechanics wise, and it will not hold your hand in finding the 'secret' areas that allow you to progress through the game... much less actual secret areas. It's also neat that your avatar in the game actually levels up over time, and one of the things I really like about the game. Did I mention the paladin is just awesome? Obviously I like it enough to say good things about part of it, but I've long since realized that steeping yourself in games with satanic imagery is an issue, if not for yourself, then for those watching you play. I'll probably leave this on my game shelf for a while before removing it from my account, and then buying it again years down the road when I've forgotten about all the satanic crap in it.			"

												This game is not very well done, if you want to play in window mode or other resolution good luck trying to make the console command of it to make it happen, every command you put is unknown to it, and the joystick options are not there either, and when playing the game with the resolution it has for default, cause not able to even change it due to faulty console commands, it looks horrible, not to mention not able to look up and down which is a mayor flaw on this, some enemies are too low to hit or too high even, if ya need to map to even look up or down, that is the wrong way to do. so i do not recommend this game, skip it if you can and play the previous titles, those are WAY WAY superior than this.

Look them up online to know what they are.The 4 Horsemen bosses are so god damn cool too.  Coolest bosses.The worlds are great; diverse and juicy.Very haunting like the first one but in it's own way.PLAY CO-OP IF POSSIBLE!Oh what a love affair I had with this game.The Developers though are makers of tons of different great games like this over the years.

												The game runs fine to me, but this version lacks the audio CD music tracks and the game expansion. You can change the audio to MIDI in the options menu or you use the phisical disc of the game. You can also download the ISO file from the disc and mount on Daemon Tools (for me only works when i mount like a SCSI device).I recommend because i don't mind doing these tricks to make the game works correctly. It's a OK game.			"

												NOTE: I played the game using the ""Hammer of Thyrion"" project, available online. It fixes several issues and adds a plethora of features the vanilla game lacks.Much like the previous HeXen game, Hexen II is an enjoyable RPG-FPS hybrid, this time upgraded from the Doom engine to the Quake engine.Played on the second hardest difficulty as the Assassin. I can certainly say I had to fight tooth and nail to survive almost every single encounter in the first half of the game. However, the biggest obstacles in the game were its immense quantity of puzzles that you had to solve in order to unlock other areas and proceed forward. While the combat was fun, the sheer amount of back-and-forth with items, switches and other things was occasionally a bit overwhelming.I loved the concept of being able to level up your character, but unfortunately, it plays a very shallow part in the overall game, barely affecting anything except your max HP. If it had been more fleshed out, it could have been significantly better.I kept getting lost in levels (admittedly due to not paying enough attention sometimes) and felt that a lot of the areas looked very samey, which greatly increased the difficulty in backtracking to the actual spot you need to be in next. I can't blame the game for this in its entirety, but it could have used a bit less labyrinthine level design.Two large problems arose during my time with the game, one being that in the first world has a glitch that can potentially softlock you, forcing you to reload an older save, cheat or just restart the entire game over. If you want to avoid this, just look up info about the Shovel and the Treasury Key. The second problem was the final boss taking way too long to beat. I kept peppering it with everything for upwards of 15 minutes before it finally went down.In conclusion, though it has some issues, the game is still good, but it will ask for more puzzle skills than you might expect from a game of this type. I would gladly buy and play the expansion pack, were it made available on Steam.			"

												This game is unique in it's own way. The graphics were pretty good at it's time and the weapons for each class can be very fun to use, especially when you combine them with the Tomb of Power. The levels and environments feel a bit challenging and a little overwhelming depending on the enemies that are there. I also find it a chore to do the puzzles in Hub 3, due to the fact that the hints aren't that good, especially for people who just like shooting enemies, and having puzzles along the same level that the first HeXen game has. The boss fights however are actually a lot of fun for me and it's fun to play as either the Crusader or the Necromancer. My final verdict for this game will be a 7.6/10, I say buy the game if you're a fan of the series, but don't be surprised if you can't solve the puzzle for Hub 3.			"
