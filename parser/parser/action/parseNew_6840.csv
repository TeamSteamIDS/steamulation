												Get commandos 2: Men of courage instead.Ok, I am not saying that this game is terrible. I played many many hours of it in the past. But compared to Commandos 2, It's not what it could be.Where commandos 2. Had a smooth learning curve. Commandos 3, throws that over board and just throws you into the deep and straight after the tutorial.Lets compare commandos 2 to commandos 3 for a quick bit.the tutorial of commandos 2 was ok. First one was quite easy, but explaining the basics very well. Then the second one gave you the feeling of a real mission in a smaller setting. Still a little easier than the main missions, it gave a good learning experience of the game. Mainly because not everything was explained to you.commandos 3 tutorial was too simple. You began training a whole long missions learning the basic moves of some of the commandos, all in a way too linear fashion. Then the second tutorial should have been the smaller mission. And it is. But compared to the actual missions, this one is way too easy, and again every move you need to make is fed to you with a spoon.but okay, the main missions are quite hard. they aren't impossible. Just require a whole lot of messing things up.Missions. Hard, doable but okay. their settings differ nicely from eachother. Though the difference could be as good as it was in commandos 2. But what i disliked most, is the linear feeling most of the missions have. Do this, go to that do that again. It just doesn't feel like the past where you had open levels and you could do them in any way you liked.Story wise, they did nicely too. They actually managed to add in 3 stories in the game.one about a traitor, one for the D-day campain. And one about a weapon if i am not mistaken.Not the spectacular stories you would hope for, but it's there at least.Diversity in players is lacking though. I feel that I am mostly just using the same players mission after mission. While leaving some alone. they even cut out some players from the previous game. But why they only used the diver in 1 mission i can't understand.Then we have the gameplay.It's okay at best.As someone who is common with commandos 2 controls this is a whole difference. Because mainly it's the same game as C2. Just with some major ajustments. Some are good, some are bad.Control wise, It could have done better. A lot of the shortcut keys are gone. And I have the feeling to get a different weapon out I am clicking more than I did in previous installments.But that is just knitpicking.Of course there are mods to enable more shortcut keys. It does improve on some mechanics though.Weapon distribution and handling is improved. And the free moving camera indoors works great too.If yhey used these mechanics in Commandos 2, than that would have been a straight A game.But last thing I am saddened about. It doesn't work as well on modern pc's. Commandos 2 still works greatly on my PC. but commandos 3 needs so many changes to the game files to keep it working. It's just not worth it.But to make it short.commandos 3. It is a good game. but only if you are a long term fan of the series. but don't expect it to be as good as commandos 2. My reccomendation. Get commandos 2 if you haven't already. It's longer and has better gameplay.If you already got, and this game does turn up with 75% off. Then it's worth getting. Just so you can feel how it could be better. Otherwise, Just stay a long way away from it.			"

												As a massive Commandos fan, I don't recommend it. In my opinion it's a step back from previous games. A lot of content got cut out, game is very short and linear, many missions depend on time and force you to play aggressively (even if you prefer the stealth approach). There are a few nice missions, but they seem more like Commandos 2 Bonus missions. After such an outstanding game like Commandos 2, I can't believe why they made something unappealing like this. Only for fans who just need to have a bit more of Commandos (and then probably play previous Commandos games again...).If you're new to Commandos - skip this game, get Commandos 2 instead, later play Commandos BEL and Commandos BtCoD.Driver (okie-dokie!) is missing :(			"

												Commandos 2 was just so much better than this. The missions are not fun anymore and they removed loads of my favorite features. Nice graphics though, but all-in-all I didn't enjoy this game as the previous titles because it felt easy and ""blah"" from the opening missions in snowy Stalingrad to the last hurrah on the beaches of Normandy.

												I recommend this game, but only if you have played any of it's predecessors. Why? Because this one is even harder due to improved AI, time limits and fewer shortkeys which is not very beginner friendly but also because it is simply not as good as Commandos 2. The developers removed a lot of features that made Commandos 2 great, such as being able to seach furniture for useful items, bonus levels, difficulty settings and many more smaller things. Sure there were improvements too, like a fully 3D engine and a bigger variety of level designs but this was not enough to make the game stand out from it's predecessors.In short: It's very challenging for Commandos veterans and other strategy gamers but near impossible for beginners who are better off starting with Commandos 2 to get used to the gameplay.Looking at the negative reviews of this game reveals that Commandos 3 might not work for your computer for unknown reasons. If you want to make sure you can play the game without any issues you'd better buy it at GOG. http://www.gog.com/game/commandos_2_3 "

												I'm just being a little picky here, it's a great game if you are VERY smart. I really suggest that you get this game when it's about 75% off, but not when it's full price. I'm new to the commandos series and I made a mistake with playing this one first. Here's a little poem I came up with which explains my experience with the game: I love the gameplay, I hate the controls... There's a lot of bullcrap, the Germans are trolls.			"

												Simply put, the worst Commandos game in the series.- Graphics are locked at 800 x 600.  A step backwards from Commandos 2- Too many timed missions.  Commandos is all about planning and playing at your own pace.- Too many sudden events triggered for no apparent reasons, often ruining a level especially if one saved at the wrong time.- Sizes of maps are too small; number of which is too few.

												While no other franchise can present you with so many seemingly insurmountable challenges, no other franchise is able to offer such a feeling of accomplishment once the objectives are miraculously achieved.Make no mistake that it is going to give you absolute hell, yet beyond the initial frustration at your apparent gaming impotence, attempting to penetrate its steely exterior becomes a bizarre pleasure that offers a triumphant sense of achievement.While Commandos 3 is still a strong concept, and most definitely a super-looking game, it's best suitable for the most patient veterans of the series.

												This 3D top down strategy game was once one of the better examples of the genre, unfortunately it's aged too badly to allow a recommendation, despite there being a ""For windows"" released version.Technical problems abound - if you have SLI, prepare for merciless flickering.  The engine is dated and was never made to be scaleable - so you have one fixed resolution, and you can choose between ""high"" and ""low"" quality, and that's it.   Pretty lame, sadly.Graphics wise - while dated, the graphics are discernable enough if you can survive the technical glitches.Gameplay - it's quite playable, although not very fun and the controls now feel really clunky.I think if the developers still have their hand out for Steam cash for this game, they need to put in the effort to update it for modern PCs and fix the bugs.

Thinking and tactics are fun and the concept and atmosphere is amazing. Yet, I had to stop playing this game as It was frustrating me to a certain point where I started talking to my commando's because they simply didn't obey the orders I gave them. Like.. protect this area. They get shot first, they got the high ground, interior and upper hand.. even a machine gun vs a pistol. But okay.. enough Commando's for me.			"

												Just about everything you do has a time limit. If you played the older games you understand how annoying that is because the very essence of these games is careful planning. The biggest issue though is it removes a lot of the unique functions of your squad members and enables them some (or all) of them to do said action, (before sapper was the guy who could use grenades now pretty much everyone can) which is kinda a big part of what made the gameplay for the old ones so good.

												I played very little of this game, but I can tell already that it is not at all in the vein of the original commandos (BTCOD and BEL)) of which I grew up with and came to love. In the tutorial, The green beret starts non-stealthily walking up to soldiers on his own, so I suppose I am to cover for him, but why? why not let me have full control of my men and the way I play the mission? and the first level is set in a war zone? and you need to take out a sniper before he takes out russian allies? these compalints on they're own are not the issue, but it's symbolic of what ruins this game for me. what happened to observing the situation and the mission in it's enterity then enacting and attempting to execute a proper plan only to watch it go awry and deciding to either go back to a last save or continue with a different set of problems? that seems  completely lost on this game. I will reserve comment for the game itself, as I am in no area to judge it independantly. my complaint is not that it's a bad game, but that it's a bad addition to a franchise I enjoyed before. and If I can get passed the title, I may end up liking it, but I don't think I will be playing it anytime soon.

												I like the game a lot, but, its so hard to make progress as I find the user interface difficult to use. I found myself just getting frustrated and ceasing to play. I think this game should be all about tactics. If I have to spend a lot of time on the details and micromanaging my soldiers than it takes away from the fun of decision making in terms of trade offs.This is what I like: - The artwork is great. - The story telling. - The strategy. - The RPG element.What I don't like: -The tutorial is buggy.   --The tutorial asks me to knock out a guard but skips to the next prompt before I finish it. -Mode based interface.   --Switching from stand to lay down or from cover mode to non cover mode makes my life difficult. For example, if I have soldiers in cover mode but I need to switch quickly to make a shot, I find it very difficult. I wish the game to be able to do that work for me. So I could respond quickly to threats. -Not able to delegate control   --If my solder is not facing the enemy and an enemy approaches from the other side then my solder does not respond to the threat. I would like the soldier to face the enemy and return fire.   --Cover mode does not seem to work for the sniper rifle.   --A soldiers line of site when covering is so small. -Complicated, bad, and time consuming controls   --I find myself getting confused between the control clicking, cover modes, cover areas, ect.   --I would like to not spend so much time trading inventory.   --I should be able to easily exchange ammo between soldiers.   --I should not have to order my soldier to search every body. Instead, I should be able to tell him to collect inventory from a group of soldiers. "

												Commandos 3 is the easiest of the commandos series, and since it’s the latest one it also happens to be the most visually pleasing. There is way more action sequences in this version than Commandos 2, and they solved the issue with easy enemy takedown and unclear objectives. In turn, the game became less strategy and more brute force. Other than the aforementioned fixes and changes the game is for the most part plays the same as Commandos 2.

I just want to play the game at my own pace....2 works A-OK even though it *along with the first two* have problems with being fullscreen, not that it doesn't work its just a bit strange, sometimes vocal briefings do not work but you can still play *Just good luck figuring things out*WOW...lets stop that train of thought, I was reviewing the third, not the series in terms of performance on Windows 8!But yeah play Commandos, its expansion, and 2 instead.

												This game...has issues. Which is a shame since it is actually really good in theory. Like so many other games, it collapses when let loose into the world. You have a number of specialists - sniper, sapper, commando, spy, thief - who all do pretty much what you expect them to do. You job is to apply their specialties where they are needed. Need to kill something quick? The commando is the man. Need to do it from far away? Sniper. Want to make boom? Sapper. The thief and the spy are the hardest to use, but are also the cleanest when it comes to their job. They can sneak past right in front of enemies, given if the situation is right. The mission is to wreck the Nazis. So you have this great game and useful tools. What is wrong?The controls are not very well organized and counter-intuitive. Even after you learn them, you find yourself scrambling to respond to the dynamic events occuring. The friendly AI also isn't very bright. They take no initiative to respond to attacks.			"

												This is the Commandos series at it's very best. A brilliantly thought through title that really lives up to the series and is a really cool upgrade from Commandos 2 which, let's face it, was pretty horrible. Every puzzle really brings back that feel of the first Commandos games, with a tiny delay leading to certain death, and many many hours of fun along with it. Would definitely recommend it to everyone.			"

It seems pretty hardcore to learn how to play. Maybe I'll get around to giving it a go, but as of now I'm not very interested in slowly progressing.

												I have played all of the Commandos games. I was a huge fan in high school, and when I saw Commandos 3 on steam for only $4 I immediately bought it. However, upon installing the game, I found that the pixels suddenly go all weird, the color scheme flashes through various, indescribable hues and the mouse cursor begins to track all over the screen. I looked up if there was anyway to fix the problem and Steam was no help at all. I checked google, and many people have had similar problems with no hope of fixing them. Honestly, the game is unplayable in it's current state. Too bad, because it really is a good game. Commandos 2 was better, and worked fine with my Windows 8 system. If you're interested in one of the Commandos games, I'd avoid Destination Berlin, and go with Men of Courage.			"

												Wow, this is terrible... I remember buying Commandos 1 on disk way back when and having a lot of fun. Commandos 3 attempts to make a strategy based game an action game and fails miserably. Commandos was originally a real-time hexagonal tile based puzzle. Commandos 3 keeps the same element but has tried to infuse more action into the game. It feels too overwhelming. The controls are too clumsy for an action based game.			"

												Generally not worth it - it's a downgrade from Commandos 2 in nearly every aspect. The campaigns are short, have rather boring, small and ""one-time"" only levels. The campaign design also makes multiplayer aspect suck. Visuals/technical-wise the game has also aged rather badly and in my opinion it's actually uglier than Commandos 2. Unless you're sucker for the series or are getting it in a cheap bundle, it might be better not to pick it up.			"

												Get Commandos 2 first. The learning curve here delicately holds your hand through the tutorial then hands you a live grenade and asks why you haven't defused it yetThe good news then, for veterans of the game, you'll really find your skills pushed here. Time is the big stricture here for many levels, where before you generally had the luxury of ticking off every enemy in your own time. Clearing a rail-field in minutes to intercept a train, with just the Green Beret, was an incredible levelIn many respects, Commandos 3 improves upon the 2nd installment. The levels are smaller, so less onerous. The variety is also pushed so it's not just repetitions of ""clear out this encampment"". Quickly move to the front of a moving train, assassinate a traitor, destroy as many vehicles as possible before they leave the compound...Ironically though, these work against it in some respects. The game is ridiculously short (compared to the previous titles) - there are only 12 levels in all, a handful of which take 5 minutes (if that), so you barely feel you get started with a campaign before it's over. Too many also become a bit ""Commandos and Conquer"" - less about stealth and more playing an RTS of hero units. They were fine in moderation in Commandos 2, but I felt they took up a few too many levels hereBut whilst I say it's probably the least memorable of the 3 titles - The quality and challenge is still definitely there			"

												I was very disapointed with commandos 3 if you compare it with commandos 2.If your familar with 2 and play 3 you may see what I mean. If you have not played No. 2 or 3 and like stratagy, stealth or WW2 themes  I would strongly recomend you play commandos 2 instead. Because in short, in various ways game No. 3 seems like it has been stripped and dummed down compared to No. 2 and without being a computer games desinger half the effort went into it for sure!  If you'd like to hear my reasons please read on...As I was saying game No.3 has been ""dumed down"" extremly and the levels are far less imaginative in terms of how you complete your goals and use your characters and there skills. In No. 2 the levels where big, colourful and interactive there where primary objectives and scondary objectives (which you did not have to do but it got you a better score if you did, was fun to do and if I remember unlocked bonus levels ect. something which they have completely removed from 3). Also in 2 There were always many diffrent approches you could take to achiveing your objectives, you could play the same level three or more times and play it very diffrently, from doing a mission objective with complete stealth and spiling no blood to setting up traps to going in guns blazing. In 3 not so much, there are only 1 or 2 objectives per level and only 1 or 2 ways of achiving them. (and this is if you count cheating, i.e being able to drive around in a truck indefinatly being shot at but not dieing while running over ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Nazis, which was funny for little while. Or cheating acidentally in frustration (I will explain my frustraion in a moment) by finding out that running wildly across open spaces into many armed enemys and stabbing them one after the other worked better at least faster sometimes than any tatically excuted plan that used any stratigical thinking or firearms from a safe place with an element of surprise.		 The last and and most effective cheat method for cleaing the way ahead and I say cheat as I dont think it would be the most effective way unless you are combating complete window licking Naiz boys with a feteish of self death by grenades. My cheat teciqunic involed finding a good spot. kill an enemy in veiw of others allowing Nazi enemys to come and investigate the body. Throw a grenade at investagators which my set off the alarms or just attract more enemy investagators. These enemys would run around investigateing all new bodies before being added to them as I got one of my men to throw another grenade. I would repeat this process if the hidding spot was good enough (or rarther if the nazis were ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enough) and kill a huge portion of enemys on the map in less than 5 minutes, as they would just all keep coming throwing cation to the wind in order to cluster about together just to conferm if there friends really had just been blown up 3 times previously.Back to my origonal point and acepting that the AI may not always be amazing in No.2 the levels and gameplay were more dynamic, interesting and challangingThe levels in No. 3 are less interesting in that they are considerably less interactive than in 2. In 3 you can climb some things like telephone poles however you wont because they often will not take anywhere useful except up and down and sereve as a little PT while in the middle of a fire fight. In 2 you could with the thief espacially climb many things which would offer a short cut, a way behind the enemy or access to some gear. Items in 3 only come in crates or dead bodies. In 2 you could find things anywhere, on shelves in boxs in hide holes, barrels ect, This made you think about your enviroment a little more and exploration of areas was part of the fun of finding new gear and ways of completing objectives. while on the subject of items and charactors inventorys, for some reson at times I could not drop, swap or place iteams back in a create from my inventory which meant it was taking up space and had no function. More frequentaly though was for some reason you could not pick up, give or top up on amunition or place/take/give specific amounts of ammo or items to, from or between characters despite haveing space in the inventory, it was a minor thing but a annoying, another minor inventory issue was you could not just click on the portats of the the charactors next to your currently selected man in order to exchange items you have to press trade then the portrait why cant you just press the portrait, a minor thing I know but it just made the play slower espacailly without a mouse. There were more varied hideing spots in 2 espacailly for the thief. There are two hide spots in Commandos 3 that I can think of (hidie place 1 were the trucks found on most levels and hidie place 2 on one level there was a great abyss  in the train staion floor, that was it). Furthermore in game No.3 hidie place 1 ""the trucks"" were actally magical portals only your men could use. As if found by the enemy your man could run over to a truck and even if seen entering the vehcial by enemys, 9/10 times the enemy in pursuit would become overwelmingly baffled at your getting into a truck and think you had just gone into thin air and so give up the chase. you could even repeat the process over and over infornt of the same nazis with learning difficulties and they would just think it was a magic trick and not be able to work out despite watching you that you had entered the truck and were in fact still there.The levels were just bigger and more exciting in 2 you could explore everywhere, there would would sometimes be wild animals moveing around in the enviroment and the weather and levels were varied in appreance ranging from snow to the tropics, the music changed aswell and the underwater scenes and well everything was a bit more alive. 3 was bland and single tracked compared .  I  know I played the game on a laptop with no mouse witch did not help but still an irritating major flaw in 3 as it often interfeared with gameplay was that you had to change camara angle very often as you switched character, or moved in and out of buildings, in 2, you could change angle, however you could play the game without constantly haveing to ♥♥♥♥ about with the camara turning back the way you wanted it. And the way the levels where layed out in 2 meant you could often play the game effectively at one angle, not so with 3! and too ice this cake of complaints the mini map is just confusing as it does not rotate and corolate inline with the camara angle witch makes it unessiseraly unuseful.Again I know playing with a mouse would have helped but comeing to my final critisim and the one that most anyoed me in cobontaion with poor camara angles was what happened to the old interface system and hotkeys. WHY did they change it? It looks like they tried to slim it down but it really didnt work and I dont think it was needed at all instead of adding something too the game they just took it away. Did they really think it would fool me into thinking ""oh my, they have made a completely new game here look how cool it is!"" NO! I think I remember playing No.2 with an interface system that made gamplay much smoother and meant I could just enjoy playing the game planning and exicuting my next move instead of winding myself up because I have been shot as I was busy changeing camara angle and switching characters and weapons. In 3 you cant quikly switch to the weapon or character or even veiw one trouble spot to the next and you cant pause the gameplay to sort out the camara or issue commands. You cant change equipment or weapons easily, You have cycle though everything in your inventory and back again if you use the keys (which often meant id end up pulling out the wrong thing like a bazoka for an enemy 5 feet away) alternativly you can click on your weapons icon then on the new weapon you want then click where you want to shot it, by this time you have missed your target or been shot a			"

												 What the hell happened here Pyro??  If there is 1 positive thing that can be said about this game is that I only paid like 89 cents with a Steam deal.  Where to start?   This game is a downgrade in every way from Commandos 2. Starting with the HORRID controls that seem to lack every hotkey and ease of functionality that Commandos 2 had. They redid it to I suppose make it more streamlined but what they did is actually limit the all the fluidity you had in Commandos2. There seems to be a lack of hotkeys and that they just aren't as intuitive as Commandos 2 was.  Graphically, the game looks a mess. The character looks heavily polygonized compared to Commandos 2 and faded. Tiny's face is literally a box with no detail on it. His arms are blocky as opposed to Commandos 2 they almost had a clayish look. I was able to improve the graphics though by cranking up my video card settings thru the Nvidia control panel as the in-game menu has zero options for the graphics. Even the sound display Commandos 2 had to show the noise your character was making is completely absent here. To be fair though, the interior detail is still pretty solid and the painted outdoor static backgrounds have great detail. Yet Commandos 2 outdoors still had a more crisp look to them. These do seem a tad blurry in comparison.  Ok, now onto the difficulty. Commandos series was always renown for it's difficulty. That actually was part of the fun to it. They at least had levels that progressed in difficulty but you could at least get a decent foothold of the game at the beginning. Commandos 3, no. It starts off brutally hard where just about any move you make sets off an alarm. It's rather frustrating when my above issue with the controls come in to play where you are fighting over controlling your Commandos and dealing with an impossible game to even begin playing. I even ran thru the tutorial but that was like super easy that it doesn't compare at all to the beginning missions.   To put it plain and simple, I do not recommend this game at all. For some reason, Pyro went completely backwards on it and it feels like this should be Commandos 2 and 2 should of been this. This is a highly frustrating game in every aspect graphically to game play from Commandos 2. Go and buy Commandos 2 or the originals and enjoy them as they represent the true end of the Commandos series for me. Even the first Desperados makes a great alternative to this. Look for that one on sale.			"

												I feel that Commandos 2 was a better game than this one.This has nice interior camera movement and graphics, but resolution is locked.And the timed missions...they suck, it became a more action focused game :( and the controlls in general do not flow as well as in Commandos 2, makis timed missions a pain, without time to enjoy the enviroment.Seams that Commandos 2 you failed because you messed up, in 3 it seams they want you to fail completly.Better controlls and better resolution would make this game better.

												Been itching to play this game my whole life but sadly im on windows 8.1,... if you're also on windows 8.1 then i suggest you dont install the game.. totally unplayable.. sure the last update fixed the sniper scope and some color glitches but the ♥♥♥♥ing field of view is totally wrecked  (ive played commandos 2 so not having the view and line of sight is driving me nuts).. it doesnt display the view, instead red and green lights flashes the screen. not to mention the black triangles and wrecked UI on some stages.. tried almost all the fix posted in google and in here but none worked, i even played and tried all the settings on suggested fixes/third party programs. if youre on win10, you still got hope.. search the fixes, people claim its working but if your on windows 8.1 then dont even try.  search some other game instead of wasting your time downloading a game which you probably wont get to work until the next update (or maybe not even).the game is good tho, one of the best (still i think comm2 is better).if you really want to play the game on win8.1, go search somewhere else where it's reliably working.

												Commandos 2 is an awesome game, but ""Commandos 3: Destination Berlin"" is much MUCH worse than it's predecessor, in fact, it would be better if they just added some maps to Commandos 2 - but nope, they just HAD to screw this wonderful game. Aside from lousy graphics and moronic difficulty, the most annoying part of the game are the controls (you can't even change the hot keys through the Options menu!). I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												This game is great. I've played it plenty of times in the past. The most negative thing is that it has a lot of graphic glitches in Windows 8. They should really patch it ASAP.EDIT:OMG They have just released a patch that fixes all the graphic bugs and errors!! This is epic. I immediately changed the recommendation of this game.			"

												Great game but dont bother buying it , Doesnt work past XP and definitley doesnt work on 64 bit OS's. Tried asking the devs to fix it but they basically said ♥♥♥♥ You we dont need to as we want to focus on our mobile games. This is a shame really as i had played previous commandos games religiously on my toshiba laptop as they were the only games that would run.			"

												OMG. I know that's an old game but those controls are nuts! Rotate with scrolling? Zoom with middle click+scroll? Move map with middle click? WTF IS THAT? You haven't even updated those controls to what modern game using? I only played Commandos 1 (and maybe 2) before but I can't remember such problems, maybe they just haven't had them, or maybe I was used to them 10 years ago...			"

												Don't look at the hours counter, I have finished this game back then with its three discs version.Amazing and challenging game, has a lot of levels, and generally an open world approach on missions: you can run over this Nazi, kill him with a knife, wait for him to come and ambush him, or just throw him a cigarette. There are also a lot of areas to explore and get ammo and weapons.The only cons I could find are simple: it is an old game, a very old game: the game is locked to a low resolution and the textures are not the best. But that why it is 3.99 instead of 20 (at least).			"
