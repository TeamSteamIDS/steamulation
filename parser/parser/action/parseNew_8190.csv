												Great game to waste time on from driving around, blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up and collecting things. Though extremely repetitive, this has kept me entertained for 90+ hours. (and over 150+ hours on the free multiplayer mod)PROS+ HUGE world map; we're talking 400 sq. miles (20 miles x 20 miles)


JC2 World Map IRL 
Community Created Artwork for Just Cause 2
By: Dr. Evil

			This is the exact size of the Just Cause 2 world. 400km sq if I recall (20 km / miles squared)		


+ Great graphics (esp for 2010) that still hold up a half-decade later+ Most PC's can easily handle this; a $100 GPU will max it out at 60 fps+ Lots of mods available + JC2MP, which adds much more things to do (and is free / 30mb)+ Blowing up♥♥♥♥♥♥is fun+ Lots of vehicles to utilize + Perfect Draw Distance; you will always see the entire world! + Nice weather system+ One of the best Sandbox games out there+ Affordable; 15$ normally; 2~5$ on saleCONS- Extremely repetitive; you're basically just blowing up stuff for most of the game- Dialogue / Missions are cheesy / bad- World is far from ugly / barren, but there's few secrets / interesting points of interest- Driving isn't the best- Combat can get out of hand fast- Little to do outside chaotic actsThis game will run very well on most computers as long as they have some power. If you can play CSGO at all you can play this. I have a lower mid-range PC (GTX 750 Ti / crappy old 3.0 Quad core AMD) and I have this maxed out at 60 fps at 1080pIf you love sandbox games this is a must-have, especially if it goes on sale. Overall, a B+ ~ A- game; it's a must-have for any sandbox fan.			"

												For those looking for a very wide open area to able to wreak havoc via a variety of different weapons and vehicles, this game is great.  It does have some drawbacks, the AI enemies are pretty easy to beat and some of the controls are a little off.  But overall I highly recommend JC2, especially if you can pick it up on a deal!			"

												The very definition of sandbox action. Sure, you can play it for the story, which is as trashy as it is charming, but where this game truly shines is in its free-roam action. There's so much to blow up, so many vehicles to drive and fly and so much crazy fun to be had. Oh, and you have a grappling hook. That thing alone can be used in such ridiculously fun ways, you will ask yourself where the time went!			"

												A true sandbox game...+ Forgettable story - Who cares. + Explosions, explosions everywhere - 10/10+ Put C4 on your vehicle and ram it at an outpost, causing huge explosions. -8.5/10+ Hijack an enemy helicopter that is equipped with two machine guns and missile launchers, pause the game, open the Internet browser via Steam Overlay, put on Ride of the Valkyries (the Opera version), and shoot every m*therf*cker on their military base or air strip. - 10/10+ Steal a military jet and shoot missiles at every thing, then ram it at an oil refinery, causing a mass effect of great explosions - 10/10+ Go ""stealth"" on a military base without ""detection"" and place C4 on explosive materials, walk away and detonate the C4 charges - 9/10+ A very large map of Panau with everything at your disposal, allowing for you to do anything you want - 10/10+ At the end you'll probably want to use only three things: your grappling hook, parachute, and C4Did I mention C4 and explosions...? (Best purchase ever; If you don't have this game, I will put C4 on your computer until you get this game) "

												months of mindless, fast-paced, explosive fun. The map is enormous, beautiful, and diverse. There is a multitude of weapons even without the DLC. The combination of the grappling hook and parachute is the best duo since peanut butter and jelly. If you think it gets gimmicky, it doesn't. It makes you wish more games had such inventive ways to move around. The people who made this game are geniuses from the streets of the cities all the way to the Mile High Club. Seriously get it.

												Open-world action game as it should be. Just Cause 2 has that great feeling of absolute freedom - go anywhere, drive anywhere, fly anywhere! You can get to any place on the huge map in just few seconds, you can be defeated without any penalties - this game is here to entertain you, not to blow your mind or make you angry at your keyboard.Two unique devices underlying the awesomeness of Just Cause 2 are grappling hook and infinitely respawning parachute (infinitely resp...? aw, forget it). Tons of fun guaranteed! Every action game should have it - I really missed them in Far Cry 3. ;-) It brings so much variety and joy in moving and fighting that you'll be travelling for hours here and there just to use them again and again.The world is really good. Yes, most of the cities and villages are copy-pasted, but there are so many different regions on the map with different climate, weather and views that you'll never get bored. Graphics is on the level too, especially fire and explosions - you'll get addicted to blowing things up! Story and quests are not the strongest part of the game, but they do their job. Another feature worth mentioning is the hidden items' search radar - in my opinion, really great idea. It is finally interesting to find stuff by yourself without spending hours in vain or using guide from the Internet.There are some cons, of course. Enemies respawning out of nowhere behind your back can be really annoying sometimes. Weapon arsenal is not so big, besides, the lack of ammunition for some weapons leaves you with even less choices. Main story is very short and optional quest lines are not so long either. But there are many things to do on the map - different challenges, races, liquidation contracts... Finally, there's still (and I guess it will be there forever) a bug that prevents you from getting the cherished 100% completion of the game (by the game's internal statistics, not the Steam's one). Thankfully there's only achievement for 75% completion, so no worries, achievement hunters - you'll get your perfect Steam game. ;-)If you like free roaming in beautiful open-world game, spending time in parachute challenges, races and outpost fightings, searching for hundreds of collectibles and upgrades, spreading chaos by blowing stuff up or just flying around and enjoing you freedom - you'll definitely love Just Cause 2.------------------------------Экшн с открытым миром - такой, каким он должен быть. Just Cause 2 дарит чувство абсолютной свободы - иди куда хочешь, рули куда хочешь, лети куда заблагорассудится. В любую точку огромной карты можно добраться за секунды, никаких штрафов за гибель героя - эта игра призвана развлекать вас, а не взрывать мозг или доводить до бешенства.Два уникальных девайса, делающих игру такой шикарной - гарпун и бесконечно восстанавливающийся парашют (бесконечно восстан...? а, неважно). Веселье гарантировано! Эти штуки должны быть в каждом экшене - как мне не доставало их в Far Cry 3!.. ;-) Простое перемещение по миру и заурядные перестрелки становятся настолько разнообразней и веселей, что вы будете путешествовать туда-сюда только для того, чтобы снова воспользоваться ими.Мир игры по-настоящему хорош. Да, большая часть городков и деревень сделана копи-пастом. Но на карте столько разных мест со своим климатом, погодой, видами вокруг, что скучно не будет. Графика тоже на уровне, особенно огонь и взрывы - вы полюбите разносить всё в щепки! Сюжет и побочные квесты не сильная сторона игры, но своё дело они делают. Отдельного упоминания стоит система поиска скрытых предметов с помощью радара - на мой взгляд, отличное решение! В кои-то веки интересно искать ценные предметы самому, а не бегать часами там, где ничего нет, или сверяться с готовой картой из Инета.Конечно, есть некоторые минусы. Враги, респавнящиеся из ниоткуда прямо за спиной, порой жутко раздражают. Арсенал не так уж велик, а нехватка патронов для некоторых пушек ещё сильнее ограничивает в выборе. Основная сюжетная линия очень коротка, да и дополнительные квесты проходятся быстро. Тем не менее, заняться есть чем - всяких испытаний, гонок и контрактов на устранение на карте хватает. Наконец, достичь заветного 100%-го прохождения игры (игра ведёт свою внутреннюю статистику, не связаную со Steam) не получится из-за бага, который, очевидно, никто уже не исправит. К счастью, Steam-достижение есть только за 75%-ое прохождение, так что будьте спокойны, охотники за ачивами - вы сможете получить в коллекцию ещё одну ""идеальную"" игру. ;-)Если вам нравится рассекать по открытому красивому миру, проводить время за парашютными испытаниями, гонками и сражениями за военные базы, искать сотни спрятанных предметов и апгрейдов, сеять хаос, взрывая всё вокруг, или просто летать, наслаждаясь видом и собственной свободой, вам определённо понравится Just Cause 2.

												Just Cause 2 is ridiculous in the best possible way. In the space of a few moments, you can grapple to a hovering helicopter; beat up the pilot and hijack the chopper; blow up a cluster of fuel tanks; put the chopper on a collision course with an enormous antenna; jump out at the last moment; and watch the resulting explosion as you parachute down to the saddle of a moving motorcycle below. But in the life of Rico Rodriguez, such events are just another day at the office, though in this case, the office is the gigantic island nation of Panau, where three gangs vie to wrest control from a corrupt government. This is a big game that gives you a lot to do and a lot of crazy ways to do it. When Just Cause 2 gives you the freedom to do the things you want in the way you want, it shines in all its preposterousness and good humor. When missions and challenges shoehorn you into specific actions, however, the same loose mechanics that make the open-world exploration such a joy become a frustrating burden.			"

												FREEDOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMSizeThis game feels huge in scale! There is tons of cities, factories, bases and even references here and there in the game. Despite the size of the terrain  you can navigate it fairly quickly due to having the awesome grapple hook and parachute mechanics. The movement from how you can move from one vehicles to other vehicles and the way you can use hooks in a variety of ways to mess with your enemies makes the game really fun and dynamic.StoryThough lets be clear the story is not great at all, its just there to justify you exploding everything possible on the island and accumulating as much chaos as possible. The story is so wacky that its fun putting you in crazy situations Black MarketCalling the black market kind of gets annoying however because you constantly have to watch the cinematic for the intro of it and outro depending on what options you picked. So everytime you want weapons,vehicles or just using it for fast travel you will be watching the short clips. Every. Single. Time. (Hey you can skip it at least)MultiplayerMultiplayer is what you think it is, going around and playing with 100’s of people that are blowing up stuff and doing races and other activities together.

IntroductionI am Tigerfrost. I would like to apologize for anything that is miss-spelled or any grammar issues. Thank you.If you'd like to skip straight to Pro's & Con's, please move to the bottom of the page. Thank you.How I Found Out About ""Just Cause 2""The same way I found out about a lot of games, from YouTube. I randomly came across a video that was showing someone driving a vehicle off of a tall snowy mountain. The crash and destruction effects made me fall in love. See, I've always loved destruction in games/movies/etc. So when I see something like that, I know I must own the game. Unfair First ImpressionsI've seen a lot of different unfair first impressions for this game. The first, and most simple being, the fact that someone may not have liked the original Just Cause game. Therefor it leads to an automatic thought that any sequel will be just as bad, or worse. I can understand this, but believe me, Just Cause 2 makes everything better. Second, I've heard that the game can get low reviews and less players because of it's story. I know some people are looking for games for their story. However, not everyone is. You can have a game like Just Cause 2 where the story is bad but the gameplay is good, very good. Third, because it's a third person shooter style of game. Which can turn some people away. Review Of ""Just Cause 2""Just Cause 2 is a massive open world, sandbox, TPS game, that comes with a full story, side missions, bonus missions, and so many collectables that you'll die before finding all of them. The world of Just Cause 2 is massive (Panau). One of biggest I have ever seen! Stretching across desert terrain and mountains, snowy mountains and terrain, jungle and marsh, ocean, urban areas, and military bases. One downside to the world of Just Cause 2 is that it may be very big, but it's not well populated with stuff. Meaning, all that jungle and desert, 90% of it will not have anything in it besides sand and trees. So you may find the world itself being very boring at times. However, the rest of the game makes up for that. In the world of Just Cause 2, there are urban areas to explore. Villages that may hold resources and ammo to big cities that contain higher costing vehicles & helicopters. Places like airports where you can obtain a passenger jet. There are military bases you can liberate by destroying & collecting all things within it. These bases could consist of ports, vehicle factories, little infantry camps, to big fortress type places. You can get around the world of Just Cause 2 with many things. First of all, you can use your grappling hook to get to higher places, then you can use your parachute to glide down or travel across land faster. Not only is that the most basic of travel, there are vehicles...a lot. There are a little over 100 vehicles in Just Cause 2. Anything from ATV's, motorcycles, cars, trucks, boats, armored cars, planes, helicopters, etc. The list goes on. One thing that I do not care for in the vehicle department is the vehicle physics. The vehicle isn't really that responsive, or reliable. You can hit the movement key lightly and the vehicle will spin out, even at low speeds. You can defend yourself with weapons like SMG's, shotguns, etc. There really aren't many weapons to use in the default game unless you purchase DLC. However, there is still so much content in the game, you don't actually need DLC so the DLC is just there for bonus weapons & vehicles. I would like it if Just Cause 2 had more weapons in the default game. With how big the world is, having more weapons gives you more options to do things with.This isn't really the game that plays like a TPS game. You don't run up to a base and get behind cover then start attacking. The AI is kind of stupid, and the same time, they work well. There really isn't any stealth. The concept behind Just Cause 2 is that you drive in for fly in, kill everything, and walk away from a massive explosion. As for the story and side missions. The story itself is generic and not really exciting, except for the final mission. There are only six missions I believe, maybe more. However, to unlock story missions you must gain chaos which can be obtained by destroying key points in military bases, fighting the military, collecting things, or completing side missions. There are a lot of side missions to choose from three different sub factions who you'll find fighting the military at times. The side missions themselves can actually be unique and fun, however the briefing itself is low. Every mission start, you'll stand there and the leader of the sub faction will drive by, tell you what you need to do, and then drive away. Not a word said. Don't get me wrong, Just Cause 2 is a great game, it just may not be what you are looking for. Content In Just Cause 2 (Bonus Missions & Collectables)In the world of Just Cause 2, you have bonus missions alongside ""side missions"". These mainly consist of races, for all vehicle types. Other then that, you have thousands of collectables. These can be little pickups for the sub factions, or little resource crates that boost your stats, like giving you weapon parts to upgrade your weapons, or armor parts to give you more health, etc. To gain 100% in Just Cause 2 requires you to collect every piece of sub faction items and resources, also, destroying key military structures in an area. Each area you discover will give you a progress bar, when everything has been collected or destroyed, the progress bar will reach 100% and that area is clear. However, the PC version of Just Cause 2 experienced a bug where a few items & structures do not spawn in the game. Therefor it is impossible to beat the game 100% without a mod. The devs apparently do not care to fix this easily fixed problem. Pro's & Con's (Overall Rating)Just Cause 2 is an open world TPS that provides a wide variety of collectables and fun destruction. You can spend hours on the game before ever reaching 15% for full completion. Despite needing a mod to fully beat the game 100%. There has alos been a community mod released that allows people to play together in the world of Panau. Pro's:+Massive open world.+Loads of collectables for hours of game time.+Fun destruction system.+Addicting ""I must find everything"" style.+DLC is not required to play.+Nice variety of vehicles.Con's:-Mod needed for full completion.-Enemy will spam helicopters.-Mostly boring empty world. -Strange vehicle mechanics.-Low leveled main story & side mission briefing.Overall Rating: About A 12/15 (A Nice Game That's Worth A Pickup)Credits & DisclaimerThank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope this helped out with your decision on whether to make a purchase or not.Remember, this review is based off of opinion only. You may not think the same way as me towards something, but that's okay, because we are all human.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Just Cause 2 Original Release: 2010 Genre Tags: Sandbox; Action; RPG; Third-Person; Open World   My Overall Grade: A Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 15-50 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Auxiliary (Standalone) Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Sandbox gamersREVIEWBlow up a small fishing village's water tower in order to save their country. Why? Just 'cause.Just Cause 2 is one of the best games around for exciting open-world mayhem. Nice graphics and animations, a diverse gameworld, and an interesting atmosphere establish an enjoyable explorative experience. The world is loaded with collectibles to find, vehicles to commandeer, and things to blow up. And it is headlined with exciting, distinctive gameplay chock-full of mayhem and destruction. If you are into sandbox mayhem, this should be a sure thing for you; and even more casual fans of the genre should easily enjoy this game too, because it is just so outright fun.Now Just Cause 2, as is apparent by the title, is the sequel to the first Just Cause game. The first game was decent, and I had some fun playing it. But to be honest: anything it can do, this can do better. Both games use the same core concepts for gameplay, except the ideas were certainly executed better in Just Cause 2. So you really don’t have to worry too much about missing anything worthwhile if you would prefer skipping over the first game entirely. Even the narrative of Just Cause 2 is almost entirely unconnected to the first game’s story, so reading a brief synopsis should be more than sufficient for you to fully enjoy the experience. Having said all of that, though, if you really enjoy the genre, then you may want to check out the first game too. Anyway, the strongest attribute of Just Cause 2 has to be the riotous gameplay. You move around in an over-the-shoulder view while on foot, with various firearms at your disposal for taking out militants. And the patented grappling-hook mechanic allows some innovative ways to take down foes, bringing a distinctive novelty to the combat. Furthermore, shortly into the campaign, a wide variety of vehicles (cars, boats, helicopters, planes, and more) becomes available. These are great not only for your basic traveling needs, but also to perform ridiculous and hilarious stunts. And of course, the grappling-hook and parachute combination can be used to explore the gameworld in the signature Just Cause fashion that affords the franchise its unique identity. And with the myriad of collectibles to find, structures to destroy, statistics to record, and achievements to unlock: there is no shortage of things to do.And I suppose if the gameplay is the best attribute of the game, then the gameworld presentation is a very close second. The graphics are pristine and the landscape is packed with diverse sceneries and environments. From mountain peaks to desert valleys, it has it all. The animations and effects are also mostly well designed, which enhances the gratification of bringing a wake of destruction through every last place you visit. And the world is humongous. Even with a jet it can take a while to cross the map. Luckily there is a fast travel system that allows you to begin a sky-dive from above any location you have visited. It integrates perfectly with the game, taking what would be tedious and flipping it into one of the most enjoyable things to do. Just Cause 2 easily has one of the most entertaining gameworlds to explore.But even with all of this going on, the game starts off with a very focused and linear mission that allows you to be introduced to the main narrative elements of the campaign. You will come to find, however, that the story aspects of Just Cause 2 are minimal, and mostly mediocre. So you definitely shouldn’t go into it expecting to be told an elaborate story. But despite that, the narrative flows and the various missions are certainly enjoyable. The missions are purposeful and focused, which can be a refreshingly stark contrast to the mindless mayhem side of the game. But while there is a decent amount of total missions including the extras, there are very few main storyline missions, which does hold the overall experience back a bit. So there is some room for improvement.Ultimately, Just Cause 2 is a good example of what can be done in video games when great concepts meet great execution. It is such an all-around fun and distinctive experience that I would recommend everyone give it some consideration; and if you are a fan of the genre, then it should be a no-brainer.And as an addendum: there is now a free multiplayer mod DLC. With the mod, the opportunity for hilarious stunts and mayhem is increased exponentially as numerous players can all play in the same sandbox at once. As a free bonus, it is a pretty sweet addition and can be a lot of fun if you like that kind of thing. Luckily, if it doesn’t sound like your thing, it is also easy to completely ignore since the mod installs as a separate “app” on Steam with separate statistics and achievements tracking.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

												Do you like making things explode? Yes? Then buy this game.It's the most ridiculous, action-packed, explosion-filled blockbuster of a game I've ever played and since it's several years old at this point you should be able to pick it up for beans. If you're an action game fan at all, there's no reason not to own this.			"

												Just Cause 2 gives you a massive island nation to freely explore, wreaking havok as you slowly discover hundreds of locations and find over a thousand items. JC2 is so insanely fun because it completely indulges the player while minimizing the tedious elements of open world games.Other open world games require slow walking, but JC2 gives you over 50 vehicles (cars, tanks, fighter jets, and more) plus your essential grappling hook and parachute. If you’re hoofing it, you’re doing it wrong. Rather, open up the anywhere-accessible black market and buy a helicopter with dual-machine guns.JC2’s biggest achievement is how it makes you feel totally in control, able to go anywhere and do anything. There are no invisible walls or disconnected “levels”. And visually, JC2 is really, really attractive. The weather and water are standouts still looking good years after release. The artwork is all very well-crafted, with amazing attention to detail.The story is fun, too, with a very B-movie feel, intentionally hokey, but it works very well because of very solid voice work. The game also has a great self-awareness, featuring a hilarious dictator who will make you chuckle as he spouts his pontifications from loud speakers.Are there downsides? A few. You run out of ammo often, but after 5 hours or so you learn to simply order new guns. There’s no stealth elements but that’s ok. Very few buildings have accessible interiors but no biggie. Overall, the large scope, consistent quality, and accessible controls of JC2 make it one of the purest video games ever created. When you’re tired of “serious” games let JC2 cleanse your gaming palette.			"

												Just Cause 2 is a legendary over the shoulder sandbox shooter along the lines of Grand Theft Auto without the charm. The game focuses on destruction, deep controls and doing whatever craziness you'd like to do. You play as Rico Rodriguez and you've been sent in by the government to mess things up like a kitten in tissue paper on an island nation that seems giant by gaming standards. You have the option work for different factions / gangs that have their own agendas. The gangs are a nice touch and you'll see them battle each other on the island while civilians run and hide. Its a nice AI dichotomy.Since the game is set on a bunch of giant islands, the terrain is gorgeous and diverse. You'll see lush green jungles beneath icy mountains, then go into those icy mountains and down into sandy deserts. After that, you can take a boat for a ride across beautiful blue waters, then hijack a jet and surf on top of it into a golden sunset while dodging missiles. Everywhere in this game is a gorgeous place and there are tons of places to visit and blow up. There doesn't seem to be any interiors, but that is fitting for a game so beautiful with good traversal diversity.The controls are deep, but they allow you to do a lot more than your average over the shoulder sandbox shooter. You have your standard, run, jump, gunfire, reload, grenade, toggle guns, toggle grenades buttons, but you also have the infamous grapple hook. This hook is what the Bionic Commando reboot was missing. Double pressing it will send you instantly zipping to wherever it latched onto. Traversal is made super easy, climbing up buildings with the hook, but not just that, but you have a parachute that is used to glide around. Simply hit the jump button while in the air to deploy the chute. Pressing and holding the grappling hook will grapple something, but then when you hold it, aim at something else and release the button, you've now tethered two things together, which results in hilarity. Tether a moving car to the ground, to watch the car flip over. Tether a NPC to a rocketing propane tank and watch them blast off. Not just that, but there is plenty of car combat. Normal games would have you just get in a car, not this game, you can get on top of the car to shoot things, or you can slip down in front or behind the car to shoot things using the car for cover as its moving. You can take over moving vehicles, with easy quick time events that show a struggle instead of just kicking a person out from behind the wheel.Combat is pretty easy, you just aim the cursor and fire. There is no aim button, if your cursor is remotely near anyone or anything, you will see a red highlight around the logical target. So if you the player have terrible aim, Rico Rodriguez will still shoot the target. In terms of holding guns, you can hold one two handed gun and two one handed guns. There are throwable explosives and you can toggle between two types. You can also melee enemies with the grappling hook.With so much control freedom, you can tackle missions any way that you want. Such as a car chase mission where you need to escort the driver, do you grappling hook vehicle to vehicle, taking out enemies and struggling to knock out the driver? Do you tether the other vehicles to the ground and watch them crash, or do you use your parachute to hover over the action and blow up the other vehicles? The choice is yours. It is an excellent game to do what you want.Missions themselves give you easy to follow objectives as if they were steps to follow. Open the gate, take out that rocket launcher, take out those snipers, pick up that item, grapple onto that helicopter, and so on. The objectives are marked with red and easily found with how far away they are. If you try to deviate too far from a mission location, the game will warn you and start a 10 second counter. This keeps the intensity on and prevents people like me from exploiting things.Outside of missions, there are plenty of things to do and they're all marked on your map. Well you need to visit the location marked on your map before you find what it is there to do. Things such as races, time trials, destroy bases and loot villages. Destroying locations and looting villages each has a percentage attached to it. To loot a village, you need to find 100% of things hidden there. Things like vehicle parts, weapon parts, cash boxes and even liberate the village from propaganda buses. Thankfully when you get near something findable, it will show up pointing out where you are, but you need to be very near it. This saves you from detailed searching. It is the same for ammo boxes and health cabinets.As for the bases, you need to find things and blow up things such as towers, generators, gas tanks, communication towers and surface-to-air missile launchers, each will make up 100%. It is fun for explorers to seek out every nook and cranny, but I can understand if getting 100% would feel like a chore.When you create chaos or break any sort of law, the local military will be sent after you. At first it'll be simple things hunting you down, but if you keep creating chaos, your 'heat' level will go up and more soldiers will come after you. How do you reduce your heat level? Hide. Yep hide in the jungle and after time your red heat will go to orange heat and start dropping down. This is good for keeping the focus on what you were doing before you created heat. With plenty of jungle in the game, it is pretty easy to ditch any heat you might have.Sadly the enemies feel pretty dumb. No one takes cover when you're putting bullets into them, even if enemies are next to cover, but I guess people play for the fun of doing what they want, not the challenge. In car chases enemy vehicles will just ram other objects. It leads to some laughable moment. They'll just drive off cliffs when you hit the brakes. I can understand scripted events like running into a gas station, but otherwise it is hilariously bad.The game is pretty easy even on normal with regenerating health. Not just that, but health pickups from cabinets seem well placed. If you die, you go to the last checkpoint. Sometimes the checkpoints are further back than you think, but that's the only thing that really presents a punishment in the game.The real downside to the game is that it seems to crash once every few hours back to the desktop. Luckily the game has an autosave feature.To top all of that off, there is a free Multiplayer MOD that allows every player into one world together for chaos to ensue. Is it worth $15? Sure.... but it has been on sale before at $2.50. Keep that in mind.			"

												Y'know, Just Cause 3 (Yes, I'm talking about 3 really quick, hear me out) had a much more refined game experience: the shooting controls were tighter, the grapple was far more versatile and useful, the parachute was easier to control, and the wingsuit was a blast to use and was a great addition to the game. The explosions were bigger, the voice acting was more tolerable, the weapons were crazier, and so on. I could list many more things that JC3 does better than JC2.But you know what? Despite ALL of that, Just Cause 2 has a certain charm to it that 3 doesn't. JC2 is honestly just...I dunno. It's so much more fun to play. Maybe it's because it feels less generic and AAA-ish. Maybe it's because you didn't have to do little challenges and destroy the same boring props in every town to progress. Maybe it's because the world was more varied and interesting, and towns and bases felt like actual places instead of bullet points on a list of things to blow up. Just Cause 2, as unpolished as it is, ends up being the more enjoyable game in my opinion. And this is just vanilla; JC2 is stupidly easy to mod, and there's tons of crazy mods out there to really crank up the insanity. Naturally, it's also far easier to run than JC3. Even the craptop I keep in my room can handle this game at 30fps on low settings.The current price of $15 is well worth it imo. If that still too much for you, you're in luck because this game goes on sale frequently and it's dirt cheap at that point. You could be standing in line at Target and pick up 3 Snickers bars and Just Cause 2 on sale would be cheaper. And the Snickers would be gone after a minute or two. You get to keep Just Cause 2 forever until Steam explodes.♥♥♥♥ Snickers.Buy Just Cause 2. For seriously.			"

												HUGE world with tons to do, some of the missions are annoying, but most are pretty good. The environment is really freeking big and you can spend hours looking for water towers to blow up, or statues to pull down. Maybe you want to blow up a gas station.  Out of ammo, need a bigger better gun? Call the black market dealer and have him drop something off for you.  I've played for 11 hours and only scratched the tip of the surface of the upper crust of how much there is to offer.  One of my go to games when I want to blow stuff up.The game can get a bit repetitive, but come on who doesn't have fun crawling into an attack helicopter and laying waste to the world. Maybe you just want to carry a mounted machine gun around and blow everything up for an hour, go to town.This game is constantly on sale for $2, and DLC is on sale in a bundle. If you hate fun stay away, maybe my little ponies or something is more your speed.			"

												This is an open world game that will make you laugh like a retard at times. This game is just CRAZY!!! It has a huge open world which you can't explore even in a million years (Not really). JC2 doesn't have much of a story or missions. Its just a game where you explore and collect stuff and do all crazy stuff you can think of. Like punching someone in the balls.....NO....nothing like that. Chaos is what this game is about. Go and destroy and blow up anything you see. Do crazy stunts with planes and cars and bikes. Do races and jump off a building and........DIE. A LOT of side missions to do. I have more than 100 hours in this game and I'm not even 50% done in this game. You will never get bored of this game at all. You will keep playing and doing stuff. If you add mods then that will make the game even more fun. Now that its multiplayer mod is coming so you all must have this game so we can do crazy stuff together and punch people in balls together. 9/10. Get it!!			"

												This game is ♥♥♥♥ing insanity. From the ridiculous story, to the mechanics, to the all-out action, to the cheesy characterisations, this game is 100% ludicrous good fun. It's at its best when you're in the middle of the action with explosives and vehicles erupting left right and  centre - there is certainly no shortage or vehicles, weapons, explosive tanks, and enemies to engage with. Do you want to surf a 747? You can. Do you want to fly as high as possible and then just skydive for a nice 5 or 6 minutes? You can. Do you want to hijack a chopper mid-air and use it to destroy an oil refinery just for the thrill of it? You can. This is up there as one of the most fun sandbox games to date. Unfortunately, however, the world is pretty shallow, and for all the locations and collectibles, the breadth of the gameplay is fairly limited. It's not a living, breathing world like the GTA worlds - the environment (which looks wonderful and varied enough in terms of climate and locations) is inhabited by people without personalities, and who exist only to be shot at, blown up, or otherwise maimed. The missions are compelling to a degree, although there is a degree of repetition in the faction missions that would become grating if the action wasn't so fun. However, I didn't at any point on XBOX or PC find myself compelled to 100% the game, as this involves hours of repetition with little tangible reward. This is felt the most when the end-game is at hand, and there's not a lot to motivate you to play beyond the completion of the missions. The story isn't very compelling or coherent, but it is bad to the point of *almost* coming around to good again, of which credit should be given to the writers for just going with it (a climactic battle that happens while clinging to a ballistic missile in flight?!). However, the dialogue itself is pretty bland and boring, and the sense of humour that they're going for doesn't always hit the mark.In summary, the JC2 is huge and stunningly beautiful, and the action is ever-present and very fun, which makes this a vast improvement over its predecessor, and lets it stand apart from the other open-world games of its time. In saying that, it lacks the personality of the world that GTA nailed, and the sense of humour that Saints Row did so well, which leaves it feeling comparatively empty at its core. However, if you're looking for spectacle, the game is well-priced and looks amazing, and there's a lot you can do and see in this game that can't be found elsewhere. For the price, I highly recommend it.			"

												For the longest time Just 'Cause 2 was T.H.E. game on my 'good game' list. It was what I understood as a quality game experience, as early as the first announcements for JC3 were announced I would be scanning Steam store for a possible entry, without success. Now, easily 3 years since those announcements; I receive the SQUARE ENIX e-mail declaring the new Just 'Cause 3 is coming soon.I am excited; Just 'Cause 2 was to me in ""shootemup"" terms what Assassin's Creed is for ""hack'n'slash"". I found it awesome,very playable [in-fact some of the first DLC I ever purchased online was from Just 'Cause 2]. I also recall my reaction seeing this could not be played on XP operating systems. It would be unfair ignoring Just 'Cause 1 , like with Witcher 1, I was largely impressed with Just 'Cause 1; not as much THOUGH. I prefer Just 'Cause 2 more than 1, and I prefer Witcher 1 more than Witcher 2 [Just 'Cause 1 & Witcher 1 feel the same in game-play although the one is medieval and the other more modern-day].  The quality of Just 'Cause 2 was high, or HD [high definition], like AC1 and onward. That's WHAT caught my attention with Just 'Cause 2! The qaulity today of this game is very high. This game got me excited about ALAN WAKE games (they look alike).Then gratefully, square enix integrated our hero [Rico Rodriguez] into other games like Sleeping Dogs, his clothing and handgun, like Adam Jensen of Deus Ex into Hitman Absolution and Tomb Raider.At the time of release, I understand THIS game to be one of the Pioneers of HD 3rd person gaming.Thankfully,these days we are now receiving feeds from XBOX,like Ryse:Son of Rome.So this sort of thing is more common.Highlights-DLC jetpack parachute, (great toy)-Grapple hook abilities,-Open World with lot's to discover-check out the little scorpions running around Panau -in anticipation of Just 'Cause 3Game on  :-)			"

												If you have two dollars and see this game on sale, get it.This is a huge, beautiful open world game with alright driving mechanics. Even if you never touch the story past the opening levels, there are hours upon hours of things to do. The graphics are beautifully and wonderfully optimised that I sometimes forget this was a 2010 title. Flying, driving, just messing around is all great.			"

 BOOM!  PROS + Explosions! + Pretty and immersive graphics. + Chaos! + Gigantic map,  lots of location to explore. + Bombs away! + Warning: grappling hook is stronger than a goddam black holes. You wanna catch an airplane?  Just shoot the damn thing. + Kaboom! +...  You get the idea. All the explosions make the game a lot of fun. CONS - Somewhat decent story,  but it could be better in my opinion. - The Map has too much ""empty""  zones. - The game is kinda repetitive..   because chaos chaos chaos. OVERALL 7.3/10 -   Oh look, another silo *BOOOOM*  "

												Just another top class game, the graphics are really really nice. This is truly a sandbox openworld game with a gigantic map and over 100 vehicles to fly and drive with awesome scenery at every turn. So much fun is to be had with this game but it can get repetitive if you stick to one thing for too long but make sure you shake it up with the challenges and faction missions. Destruction in this game is brilliant and wont let you down in that department with lots of stuff to blow up. Buy this game when its on offer for even better enjoyment! This game is like mercenaries crossed with GTA crossed with Far cry 2.There are some bugs in this game that comes with the 3rd person view and sometimes you can fall funny and get stuck for a few seconds before your guy will get up but you can overlook these.

												This is THE definitive Just Cause experience. While Just Cause 3 has better textures, explosions, friendly NPCs, and a wingsuit, Just Cause 2 is definitely the better game. The island of Just Cause 2, Panau, is incredibly memorable; grapple around the streets of Panau City, drive a motorbike across the deserts of ""Lautan Lama,"" or do some temple sightseeing in the ""Berawan Besar"" mountains, and then do it all again. This game never gets old. You can ride on top of cars while they fly down the highway, or jump off a casino and plummet down a waterfall into the jungles below. Stop an evil Asian dictator from taking over the world, attach an explosive barrel to a guy on a scooter, race at the race track, or hijack a Colonel's plane in his backyard and fly it into a mountain. You can get crazy in this game! The music is fantastic, the mechanics are good, the graphics still hold up, and there is about 150 hours of content. Play it!			"

												""Just Cause 2"" reminds me a bit of a GTA clone but on tropical island. Personally I didn't really care for the whole storyline, as my main goal in the game was to cause mayhem and destruction to military forces in game. It reminds me a bit of over-the-top Hollywood action film, but that is, without a doubt, the best part of this little wonder. Massive explosions, body count, that would make Arnie and Sly blush, grappling onto buildings, vehicles and even helicopters or air planes will make you love this game. I will recommend this production to everyone, that wants to have a little fun, blow something up or just simply drive around the island in one of many vehicles available in game.			"

												AWESOME! Basically a better looking GTA 4. Oh wait... did I forget to mention? YOU HAVE A GRAPPLING HOOK! Plus, there is now a multiplayer mod officially supported by steam, with a stronger community than Call fo Duty Ghosts (You'll guaranteed find a populated server).Awesome multiplayer, hilarious speed boost. Just plain awesome, especially if you like open world free roaming games of this genre.That not enough for you? Well... there are hundreds of mods such as an infinite amount of money, indestructible or fast vehicles, and the best of them all... the CRAZY CIVILIANS MOD! The crazy civilians mod basically messes with their steering AI or something, making all the citizens drive crazily, and drive (crash) planes. TOTAL MAYHEM!Definitely a good game.			"

												Just Cause 2 is a 2010 open world action-adventure video game developed by Avalanche Studios, published by Eidos Interactive and distributed by Square Enix. It is the sequel to the 2006 video game Just Cause.The player is free to roam the game's open world, not having to focus on the game's storyline. Progress in the game is measured with Chaos, which is earned by completing missions, destroying government property, collecting items for the factions and reaching 100% completion in settlements and military bases. Chaos unlocks new agency missions and stronghold takeovers. Chaos and stronghold takeovers expand the factions' area of influence, which unlocks faction missions and race challenges.Initially, the player must acquire weapons and vehicles in the field. Early in the game, the player encounters a black market supplier, from whom weapons and vehicles can be purchased, with an option to have them delivered to the player's location via helicopter. As more Chaos is gained, additional weapons, vehicles, and the extraction option become available on the black market. All weapons and vehicles on the black market have parameters that can be upgraded in several steps, by building upgrades with weapon and vehicle components found within the game world. There are over 2,000 parts that the player can acquire.Overall by my experience, this Game is a Must-Have so I would Rate it:Rate 11/10			"

												It's a strange game, really. To me, it collides beatifulness of sights, marvels of almost supernatural flights, and uglyness of c.i.a. operative agenda. For sandbox game, it looks almost perfect.But I'll start from bad side.Story are weak, alike with any subsequent missions of ""Just cause"", and it's because of game pattern - CIA operative wreaking havoc and destruction on peaceful countryside for USA profit and domination. That's a little more complicated than muscling drug deals, car thefts and bank robbing, like usual gta-like stuff, don't you think? Ok, there was ""Mercenaries"" and brilliant ""the Saboteur"", and I liked them! But in those games you were aiming primarily to military objects, and were penalized for civilian casulties. Conscience sleeps well on that. But as for ""just case"", you blowing power and water supplies in cities and villages. You are coherently destroing all of life-suppoting communications in country for such irrelevant aim as ""chaos"". Oh, and for drug deals - which CIA operative ever don't get envolved in that? Worse than that is only agenda of ""Prototype"" game, where civilians are just food, and only thing protagonist cares about is himself. But enough of that.Question is - is it playable?No doubt! There are so many strong points by those this game, shipped 5 years ago, are still no.1!Game process itself feels very, very exciting, especially if you like big size deals in sandboxes. Landscapes looks great, greater than in recent Far Cry 3. And you can fly it over and over, by rotary planes, jets, helicopters and on your own by magic ""always ready"" parachute combined with grappling hook (powered with same magic of everediness). Array of climat zones, from tropican seasides to the coldest highs of mountains, jungles, skyscraper cities, farms and villages, monasteries, industrial zones, even ""mile-high"" floating casino. Variety of cars, boats, guns... and plenty of space and challenges to enjoy it.Generally, its a top-high gta-like sandbox game, made for freeriding. And you know many people who likes GTA definetly that way - way of freeride skirmish. Buy it on occasion and have fun with it, when you feel rush for flying or blowing things.Overall 7.5/10 (only for lack of good story and abomination of CIA agenda)Plus 10/10 chaos points for multiplayer! Definitely try it, right on!			"

												Just Cause 2 is a 2010 open world action-adventure video Game developed by Avlanche Studios, published by Eidos Interactiveand distributed by Square Enix. The GameplayIs split up between freeform exploration including cars and bikes, planes, boats, helicopters and skydiving (with unlimited butt parachutes for paragliding purposes, complements of Uncle Sam) and a little bit more structured missions with objectves that need to be checked off before the mission can proceed towards completion. How you go about these objectives (neutralize targets, rescue VIP's, capture locations or vehicles) is often left up to you, provided you don't stray too far from a designated mission area. Weapons are multitudinous and varied; your standard assault rifles, pistols and submachine guns as well as rocket launchers, grenades, triggered explosives, and the more exotic hookshot weapon which allows you to attach opponents to the ceiling, a vehicle, or each other, as well as move around quickly in both horizontal and vertical movement. The Story Revolves around Rico Rodriguez, spy and mercenary hired by the US (off the record, of course). Your job: Cause chaos and destruction across the tiny island nation of Panau, whose new president Baby Panay (Yes, seriously) has started to isolate the nation and build up the Panauan military. This has caused the purposely nebulous Agency to be called in, to destabilize the nation and install a puppet for a head of state. It is all utterly ridiculous, stock Bond novel stuff with lots more explosions and thankfully less Bond-babe-bedding. The fact that all of this terrorism carried out in the name of the US turns out to all be because of the newly discovered and massive Panau oil fields, leaves a bad taste in my mouth. All of that blood on your hands, and it was simply to protect national fuel interests.From me 9/10 Sweep  "

												I feel like it's still one of the best open world action games available on Steam. The map is very close in size to Just Cause 3, however, due to the elevation and more diverse landscape (plus less water), the JC2 map feels MUCH larger.When I play it, I feel like I'm on the set of a Mission Impossible movie. Optimization is great and although it's graphics are a dated, the control feels so  natural that it's easy to lose yourself in the game.Play as the real Rico (before they changed him in Just Cause 3). It makes a huge difference, the mission design seems more dynamic as well.You can get it super cheap on a sale if you wait and it's very much worth it!			"

												Just Cause 2 is no doubt my favorite game of all time, i have 77 hours on pc and most likely more to come just playing around with mods but even without mods it's amazing, I have over 300 hours on PS3 with this game.     The ammount of action in this game is a huge ammount and you can be as creative as possible with however you do things, the way you can kill your foes varies around shooting them in the head or attaching them to a car and driving them off a cliff. If you finished everything, just spend your time driving around the massive map, finding all the eastereggs like Pie Island, The Bubble Gun, or the Hot Air Balloon. The possibilities in this game is damn near endless. The story was great, wasn't too long and wasn't too short, was definitely worth doing regardless of people not even doing the story in the first place.I cannot recommend this game enough and can be toyed with for hours.I am so very hyped about Just Cause 3 which is coming out in 2015. If you do not have this game already, it is usually on sale for less then $6 USD and rarely stays $15.If you want a game to mess around with when you have no internet. This is the one.			"

												Just Cause 2... Chaos, chaos and one more time CHAOS! Playing this game is so much fun...The grappling hook, all the explosions and the car chases. Hooking a police car chasing you to a wall and watching it getting totaly destroyed and killing tons of people is so satisfying. Flying planes is a little cumbersome and voice acting is not that good as i thought, but still this game is EPIC. Missions are quite interesting(but about half of them are the same) and each character has its own role in this game. Fighting is pretty decent in this game.The multiplayer is just boring, unless you have friends to play with.And there's one thing that bothers me, there's no indicator if someone gets killed by you.Overall a great, funny game with some issues but they are meaningless, fantastic usage of the grappling hook and a lot of fun playing it. I highly recommend buying this game if you are looking for some total destruction and well spent hours of playing games.  Type Rating   Gameplay 9   Lore 8   Audio 8   Multiplayer 7 My rating: 8			"

												This game is---- AWESOMEBefore I start babbling about this awesome♥♥♥♥♥♥ I want to clarify that I've neither played GTA nor have I enjoyed playing Far Cry so far. This is the first ""Open World"" game with guns I've really liked and therefore, I can't understand some of the negative reviews here. However, if you know more about sandbox games than me, you should probably not read on (or leave a negative comment).what's this crap all about?Well, the game doesn't really have much of a story line. You play as Rico Rodriguez and go on an undercover mission to find out the truth about your corrupt island. While you're doing the short 7 missions, you might as well just end up destroying your entire world. ...just 'cause.playingAfter having completed the basics, you can embrace the awesome scenery of the island (my GTX 660 can run it on ultra). Although the game is older than 6 years now, the graphics look great and some of today's games should really be jealous. The screenshots on steam ain't lying! And now, your adventure is only just beginning. While doing the obligatory running job for your mafia bosses, you can wreak havoc in every city and village, destroy statues and blow up gas stations, win car races and do awesome stunts on your bike. You can climb the highest mountain or fly there, because you've got a friend working for the black market who'll supply you with anything your heart desires... if you've got the necessary cash, of course. come on, nothing is free in this world, dude.The map consist of several interlinked locations and you'll need to discover them before you can fast travel. In every city, village, whatever it may be, you can find parts for the market which can then be bought, i.e. you may want to get that fighter jet one day. Keep looking, babe. You just need to open more boxes. If you have a look at the steam achievements, you can already get a good overview over what the game has to offer. Destroying objects with whatever you've got, killing the military in countless ways, and driving your♥♥♥♥♥sore. Let's get to this new location! Flying? No, I'd rather use my hook like Tarzan and walk on foot. why you should buy this gameif you've ended up here, you probably have your reasons. maybe you've heard about the fps drops with the latest Just Cause (3), or maybe you just want to feel nostalgic (like I did), you're probably right here. if you're looking for a sandbox game with little story and the opportunity to do just whatever the hell you want to do, this is the right thing. it will run smoothly on anything similar to GTX 660, and if you're fan of blowing up stuff, you won't be disappointed. Just keep in mind that the choices lie with you. if you get bored playing this game, you may not be used to the freedom this game provides you with. This is not Skyrim and the game is not about the story. I recommend playing 30min every day and keep enjoying the game, because, certainly, not everybody will enjoy playing this for 10 hours straight. Know what you're getting into, man (girl?). I play it for the sexy butts.			"

IntroductionJust Cause 2 is an amazing, open-world sandbox-esque game with breathtaking visuals and massive explosions to boot. This game takes a lot of what makes a game like Grand Theft Auto good, adds a grappling hook, and puts in much more destruction into the world. If for some reason you're getting this game instead of Just Cause 3, then you're still going to have an awesome time.Please note that I have played this game for quite a long time before I owned it on Steam so my hours do not match up with my actual game time.GameplayStoryYou are Rico Rodriguez, your typical badass gun with a gun (and a grappling hook). Set after the events of the first game, you're essentially trying to overthrow this evil dictator and confront your old mentor. I'll state right off the bat, that the first game sucks, and the story in the first and second games sucks as well. Where the GTA series has had a pretty good storyline, Just Cause didn't get that bit right yet. You are likely not going to be very interested in the story if at all, and it's fairly tedious to do the missions for reasons I'll explain later on. On the off chance you do like the story, there are some interesting missions and places you have to go, which are honestly pretty fun. But just know, the story isn't the selling point of this game.Combat & ExplorationWhat you will most likely play Just Cause 2 for, is the insanely explosive combat, and the highly immersive, open world that it provides. From the open seas, to densely populated towns. From the cold mountain peaks, to the warm valleys below; this game has it all. I've played countless times just simply free-roaming and admiring the beauty of every environment. But what's a beautiful environment without some kick♥♥♥♥♥explosions am I right? Just Cause 2 features a variety of weapons and vehicles at your disposal. Simply order a drop from your handy black market supplier, or raid a base and steal all their weapons and grab your favourite car from anyone you see. The choice is yours. Combine all this with your multi-use grappling hook, and you can quickly imagine all the possibilities in game. Don't like a soldier looking at you funny? Hook him to your car and take him for a ride. Need a lift? Hook your car to an airplane before it takes off. Two guys, one gun? Hook them together and let the magic happen itself. :^)My only concern with the weapon/vehicle system was that it felt a bit difficult to acquire the exact weapon/vehicle you wanted. The drop system was very expensive and income was very slow. For a sandbox style game, it felt very anti-sandbox to have those limits in the game. Just Cause 3 has fixed this issue. But don't let that deter you, there is a lot of raw fun to be had in this game, and you'll spend hours in it just trying out everything your mind can imagine.MultiplayerMost people play the multiplayer mode, which is a free DLC to obtain on Steam. If you thought single-player was fun, you're definitely going to love multiplayer. It's everything in single-player multiplied by the number of players in the game. VisualsFor a game released in 2010, Just Cause 2 is beautiful. The graphics hold up extremely well and even surpass a lot of games that are out right now. It's very well optimized and will run on almost anything that isn't over 2 years old at this point. Explosions are stunning, while skydiving gives you the sense of speed that it should as you plummet into the earth/sea at super high speeds, only to pull your parachute at the last second and admire the spot where you would have died instead.AudioMusic is okay, sound effects are pretty great, voice-overs suck. Much of the audio isn't really the selling point of Just Cause 2. I feel like there could have been more here, but at least the sound-effects carry it most of the time. You'll be entertained quite a bit, but you may notice that there is definite room for improvement.SummaryJust Cause 2 is one of the best games of its time, and is still insanely fun even now. Its graphics hold up extremely well and has one of the largest game maps in existence. Whenever you tire of playing alone, the free multiplayer dlc will add countless hours of fun once again, and will lead to some of the best moments in gaming. Despite a few sub-par aspects of the game (story, voice-acting, etc), this is a game you will have endless hours of fun in, and you'll barely remember anything negative about the game.If you like a really good open-world game with super-fun gameplay, look no further than Just Cause 2.9/10 - Must buy.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Just Cause 2 takes place in South East Asia on the Panau islands. You play the role of a man named Rico Rodriguez sent to track down a dangerous American. However, in order to get the information you need you work with the 3 rebel/criminal factions, the Reapers, the Roaches and the Ular boys against the country's oppressive government.Just Cause 2 is a beautiful game, sure, but looking back I honestly would want to take the over 100 hours I spent on completing this game to 100% back. It's a grind fest, all Just Cause 2 consists of is collecting weapon parts, vehicle parts and destroying a number of things to reach 100% completion in any given settlement. There isn't very much replayability once you've completed every settlement to 100%.Aspects of Just Cause 2 Worth Praising● Destructive environments. The majority of trees and shacks in the environment will come tumbling down if you use explosives or crash into them with a vehicle.● Creative transportation. The idea of using a parachute while using your grappling hook to slingshot your way across the landscape it quite creative and exclusive to Just Cause 2. I often find this method of transportation superior to using conventional land vehicles.● Plenty of vehicles to drive! Cars, bikes, atvs, boats, helicopters and planes are all in this game.Aspects of Just Cause 2 Worth Criticizing● No licensed music. You often take licensed music in other open world games for granted but after playing through Just Cause 2 for over 105 hours, it makes you realize that it's the only thing keeping you sane. It couldn't have cost that much to license music from obscure artists or at least implement a feature where you can manually install music tracks and listen to them through your PDA while you're zipping around Panau, could it?● Horrid voice acting. It's debatable but it can only be seen clearly if you have experienced a multitude of other products to compare. Personally, I see it better than Ride to Hell Retribution although Bolo Santosi and the npcs you have to escort through stronghold take overs are the cringe worthy.			"

												While the game lacks true depth, it's still incredibly fun to just boot the game up after a long and tiring day, and just make everything explode while you get chased down by half the Panau millitary. The main goal is to destroy everything, and this game does it pretty ♥♥♥♥ing well. If you're into open-world collecting stuff and explosions, this is your game. Definitely worth picking up during the sale!			"

 My Just Cause 2 Review:  Quick Summary You are a Mexican badass blowing stuff up on an island called PanauPanau is governed by a little asshat called Pandak ""baby"" PanayYour goal is to make Panau ascend into chaos by blowing stuff upGame made by Micheal Bay and James BondAfter 200 hours of gameplay I'm still at 35% completion. The storyline is quite bad but you don't buy JC2 for its plot. The explosions are rather good for 2010. The graphics are utterly spectacular for its age. The game runs really well, at 100+ fps at the highest settings with my GTX980ti, and around 40 with my old laptop at medium-low quality. Barely encountered any game breaking bugs, expect for the time I became part of the mile high club by merging into it. Other than that nothing worthwile. I will update this guide when I either get to 300 hours or get to 50% completion.  Is this game new? >No Is the storyline good? >No Is it better than JC3? >No Was it worth 200 hours? >Abso-♥♥♥♥ing-lutelyEnd of Review			"

												You play the role of a terrorist spider-man dictator liberator? whatever.., To help liberate the population you end up destroying their water, fuel and electrical grid (and space program)... When the army tries to defend their little island against you, you simply blow them up too.But seriously..  Its a great game, it plays out like a bad cheap b-movie / Stallone action movie (which is awesome in this game). and the scenery and immersion is amazing (and the ridiculous stunts and crashes too).

												---NOTE: I HAVE SEVERAL HUNDRED HOURS ON THE PS3 VERSION OF THIS GAME, AND 60 ON THE MP MOD. I'M NOT REVIEWING IT WITH ONLY 4 HOURS OF PLAYTIME---Just Cause 2... where to start? This is arguably, for me, the ultimate sandbox game. Perhaps trumped only by Just Cause 3, which I am yet to purchase, however, have played. The game sees you attempt to overthrow the corrupt government of Panau. How do you do this, exactly? By blowing stuff up. That is your main objective in this game. Cause chaos. For me, the campaign was not too important. Is it good? Yes. Is it great? Perhaps not. However, the campaign seems to just be a passing fad, and, although the dialog is well written, it is not memorable. Just Cause 2, however, offers an expansive open world, full of immense posibilities, from military bases and airports, from the smallest of villages to the huge capital city, and don\'t even get me started on the graphics. Even now, this game, from 2010, trumps many games released today, and the fact that even fairly low end (by today\'s standards) PCs can run it, makes it a viable alternative to the likes of GTA V, which requires a relatively demanding PC to run. My advice to you: Buy this game, now. At just £9.99, it is an ABSOLUTE STEAL! This game is great for people who don\'t have a great PC, or are just looking to try the series, not wanting to spend large amounts of money on Just Cause 3, or even those of you who just love blowing things up. FAN-♥♥♥♥ING-TASTIC. Oh, and, while you\'re at it, get the multiplayer mod. You can do all the same explosion-y things, but with your friends.			"

												One big sandbox of destruction and mayhem. Many many many hours will be required to complete everything.

PRESENTATION 7/10-The story isn't to be taken too seriously but it's good enough to move the action along. The cutscenes, however, are very weak in comparison to the game's excellent action.GRAPHICS Rating: 9/10-Rico's character model looks very good, but the absolute best-looking thing in Just Cause 2 is the island of Panau itself.SOUND Rating: 7/10-The voice acting in Just Cause 2 is hit or miss, but the music is always entertainingGAMEPLAY Rating: 9/10-Despite a few problems with checkpoints and on-foot combat, Just Cause 2 is an absolutely thrilling third-person shooter with a massive open world and some amazing action set piecesLASTING APPEAL Rating: 10/10I spent about 7 hours beating Just Cause 2. And that was roughly 30 percent of what the entire game has to offer. This game will keep you busy for a long time.			"

Just (Be)CauseReview after completing all achievementsStoryIf there is one place where this game falls flat on its face, it's the story.  The plot is one we have all seen before.  Government/Dictator/Angry mam gets too much power so we have to take him (and the entirety of his county) down.There are 3 different factions that you'll work for during the plot of JC2, not including your own faction, where they will send you off to do small (5-10 minute) tasks, while sometimes sending you out to help them capture a new stronghold and gain more territory for them.  However there is no choice involved in these missions, for you cannot give the faction that you like the most more territory (they all have preset missions).The main story line is fed through agency missions that pop up occasionally after enough faction missions and/or destruction has been done, these missions are a bit more enjoyable, but drag on a bit to long. Throughout this story the plot takes some turns, but none are too interesting or memorable.  Half the time after viewing a cutscene I was left scratching my head at what just happened.  Even after all this I would say that the story-line is still worth playing through if not just for the ending battle.GameplayJC2 plays like most 3rd person shooters on the market, but with a grappling hook and parachute.  The movement supplied by these two mechanics in sync made the shooting much more enjoyable that what it would be without being able to constantly fling yourself across the map.  The shooting itself is fairly bare-bones, and the aim assist is a bit too kind (even on the hardest difficuly I could just spray and take out a group), but large groups of enemies can still be a problem if you don't stay on the move.There are a few cheap enemies that stack unfairly with the glitches that this game has, such as the rocket launcher soldiers.  These guys are rare, but I found that, once I was shot, I would be flung somewhere and be stuck on the floor untill another rocket arrived to put me out of my misery.  There are quite a few of situations that you can get yourself into where you'll get stuck and soldiers will swarm your defenceless body and proceed to shoot you full of bullets.And that leads me into the glitches... there are a few annoying ones but only a few that are game breaking.  The only game breaking bug I found was, after a finished a side mission, I was without a parachute.  I looked up the problem and it turns out that after this mission a glitch cause the parachute to dissapear unless you do another mission after (without a chute).  Luckily I hadn't done that one yet so I went about doing it without a chute, and that was the most miserable I had been playing this game... but it did fix the issue.  (Just leave that quest to the end if you can)GraphicsIt's an older game at this point, but still looks good.  The water looks especially good, which is a big boon since you'll be seeing alot of it.  The island itself suffers from a bit of texture stretching and tearing at certain points, but you never really notice them as they're in areas that you'd be flying over.MultiplayerThere is a FREE yes FREE mod for this game that adds in multiplayer. Adding greatly to the experience of this game by playing it with friends. You can check that out  Here	Verdict8/10 "

-Quick Review-Just Cause 2 was my first experience with a  ""third-person action shooter"". I enjoyed the quality, the way I describe the game is with the following formula: Skyrim plus Grand Theft Auto multiplied by Explosions/Torgue minus any type of interesting story whatsoever, and let's throw in terrible airplane controls on a keyboard to boot! -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  Welcome to Panau, you are Rico Rodriguez, a spy in the service of the United states. Or as I like to call him ""the stereo typical action hero"". Playing through this game I didn't look at most of the explosions so I did a good job being a badass. As you progress through the story you end up helping three factions lead an uprising in Panau against the current dictator ""Baby"".As far as ""Just Causes"" go, I wouldn't call this game anywhere near a just cause, the only time that I was impressed with the game was at the end of the main story where the hero does something that I could actually respect and gave a pretty good reason for it. Other then that I heard enough ""Merica!"" ""Because Freedom!"" ""Because secret agents!"" ""Rico do this action hero thing"" ""Uncle Sam"" lines to make me want to eat the American Flag. Because Patriotism! If I haven't made it clear, I found the story very dull and boring, I was looking forward to finishing the story because then I can free roam all around this massive map and blow stuff up. More on free roaming in the Game Play section!Game Play: First a few notes about the controls. They are a little tricky to get used to, I found myself struggling to figure out what cover I can hide behind, and I would accidently jump out of vehicles or off objects trying to find the right move. This could be mostly to blame for being a Keyboard and mouse gamer.The strongest controls for the game is the combination of the parachute and grappling hook. There were numerous times that I would shout to my siblings in the other room ""I'm spider man with a hang-glider!"" because that's just how the controls felt, but it was very fun and never gets dull soaring around in the sky with the occasional shot to pull me forward.Please pause for a moment in loving memory of ""Atratzu who tried to fly a plane... and crashed, like several hundred times...""    Mmmmkay, the controls for the planes are terrible, I crash like it's my job too.Okay now for the quality that made this game shine: Free roaming. I have always loved freedom in a game to do pretty much whatever I want, the story doesn't last very long on this game you can wrap stuff up in a day and have the main story done. to get 100% in the world... I cannot imagine doing it, there's just so much to explore and blow up.The OCD 100% completionist part of my brain is exploding while I play this game because there's so much to explore, collect, and blow up. I really do love that type of quality in a game, I loved it in skyrim, I love it in Just Cause 2. Achievements: The achievements in this game often times require you to do things you wouldn't usually think to do. I never tired to drag someone behind my car with my grapple hook...  or string someone up against a wall and then shoot him to death. So the achievements are dynamic and interesting. But of course there are the standard achievements too: beat the game on this difficulty, do all these quests, complete the story, get 75% completion, etc.Price: Just Cause 2 is $14.99, I've played a total of 38 hours (as of 09/05/14) that is a very good price, but as always I recommend waiting for the game to go on sale. I bought this game in a humblebundle, the quality is outstanding for the amount I paid. And there's no way I'm close to finished with this game. I imagine the game will rack up near to 50+ hours. I intend to come back to it to keep playing over time. Conclusion: I felt like I was in a terrible action movie where everything is over the top, which at first I wanted to call out on the game... but it was doing it on purpose. So why insult something that's trying to be over the top? In the end I fell in love with the game.Regardless of the terrible annoying story (in my opinion, it was terrible and annoying, some people probably loved it and thought it was deep with metaphoric meaning.), sometimes clunky keyboard controls... all the terrible fireball-plane crashes I had... I still will keep coming back for more. I think this game is worth a buy and playing at least for a little bit.This game is probably best suited for people who like action games of any kind, the 3rd person perspective might catch you by surprise, so don't expect sniping or any scopes: all you have are cross hairs. If you know you like action games, and like free roaming with a parachute and grappling hook, this game is right up your alleyway.Edit/Update 11/12/14 - All achievements earned after playing for about 90 hours.

												Just Cause 2Story - Good god, what a rush. Take Grand Theft Auto, take Michael Bay and just. Mash them together. Probably one of the best games I've ever played being completely honest (Then again I say that about every cool game I play) 10/10Storyline Length - A couple days, it won't get boring, trust me.AI - Ice-cold killers. Grenades, snipers, revolvers, they'll use everything. They will find you. And they will kill you. Beware. Many different types of enemies too. Watch for ninjas Cx 10/10Experience - Ok, imagine a game where instead of driving cars, you use a zipline that's attached to your hand and infinite parachutes (not joking) to get around, where you can cause mayhem wherever you go. Tbh the only downside to this is that you run out of ammo way too quickly. 10/10Graphics - It's.... Ok, could be a bit better, but it's still great. 8/10Sounds / Voice Acting - Gun sounds, explosions and all sounds great. But the voice acting is just. Terrible. It doesn't ruin the game though, but it's just... Uncomfortable. 5/10Controls - Just straight-up easiest action game to play with a keyboard, Idk why ""C"" is aim weapon though :/ 9/10Overall - 8.5/10Just. Amazingness. If you haven't played or bought it yet, buy it and play it. Just. Please. This is quite literally Michael Bay's wet dream. ALSO, the Multiplayer Mod is free on Steam, so get that too for additional mayhem >:3THIS IS JUST. AWESOME. BUY IT NOW. YOU KNOW YOU WANNA!!!			"

												I never got around to play the original Just Cause. Mainly because my computer has always had issues with it, and Just Cause 2 pretty much improves the first game in all levels. Just Cause 2 is a third-person action game, and when I say action game I mean crazy jumping-from-airplanes-and-blowing-up-cities - sort of an action game. Rico, the protagonist, is like James Bond on steroids. You can pretty much do whatever you want, in a world at least twenty times (!) bigger than San Andreas, and five times bigger than World of Warcraft. Pick your vehicle; helicopter, airplane, sports car, moped, tuk tuk etc. and pick a random location; beach, jungle, city, highway, mountain etc. to ram, stunt, blow up, crash, projectile etc. with it. Or just hook yourself to someones boat and enjoy the eyecandies of this tropical paradise. Or hook the same guy's boat into an airplane, and see him take off. Or hook the airplane to a skyscraper and see it torpedo into a ball of flames. Your choice.The grappling hook, amongst other things, is what lift this game up from the pleasant, boring and realistic open-world games. You can use this Godly thing to pretty much survive any situation. Are you falling from insane height? No problem, just hook towards the ground and survive - Or just precipitate your parachute, that works too. It lacks actually physics though, you can't use your hook to decapitate moped drivers for example, a feature that I would want for Just Cause 3!Sure the game is far from being realistic and serious, but with great looks, insanely huge map and more vehicles and weapons than you can count - who cares if it's unrealistic? You can stand on a plane while towing another one mid-air, for God's sake! I completely recommend this title if you are even remotely intersted in action, open-world and/or just plain time-consuming roaming and freedom. There is currently a third-party mod in the works, adding Multiplayer. It adds a whole new meaning to the already balls-chaotic world, and makes it go beyond the edge.Pick this game up, if you have not already! It's been on a billion sales. "

*WARNING: The following review contains plot spoilers to a 5-year-old game.*One of the most fun sandbox shooters of our time. Ridiculous action sequences, over-the-top explosions, and lots of angry Pinoy infantry.The Gameplay is split up between freeform exploration including cars and bikes, planes, boats, helicopters and skydiving (with unlimited butt parachutes for paragliding purposes, complements of Uncle Sam) and a little bit more structured missions with objectves that need to be checked off before the mission can proceed towards completion. How you go about these objectives (neutralize targets, rescue VIP's, capture locations or vehicles) is often left up to you, provided you don't stray too far from a designated mission area. Weapons are multitudinous and varied; your standard assault rifles, pistols and submachine guns as well as rocket launchers, grenades, triggered explosives, and the more exotic hookshot weapon which allows you to attach opponents to the ceiling, a vehicle, or each other, as well as move around quickly in both horizontal and vertical movement.The Story revolves around Rico Rodriguez, spy and mercenary hired by the US (off the record, of course). Your job: Cause chaos and destruction across the tiny island nation of Panau, whose new president Baby Panay (Yes, seriously) has started to isolate the nation and build up the Panauan military. This has caused the purposely nebulous Agency to be called in, to destabilize the nation and install a puppet for a head of state. It is all utterly ridiculous, stock Bond novel stuff with lots more explosions and thankfully less Bond-babe-bedding. The fact that all of this terrorism carried out in the name of the US turns out to all be because of the newly discovered and massive Panau oil fields, leaves a bad taste in my mouth. All of that blood on your hands, and it was simply to protect national fuel interests.In ConclusionPlay this game:* If you're looking for a fun, light, free-form experience* For the flying mechanics* Because explosions.* For the graphics. Visually, this game is a marvel. Prettiest environments and ambient effects in any game of its generation!Don't play this game:* For the story. So asinine, so childish, so ripped from better sources* For the voice acting. Egregious examples: Bolo Santosi, Tom Sheldon and military radio ops.* If you like a challenge. As a long-time ""casual"" player, I find most missions a breeze right up until the end* For the missions. Where the game really shines is freeform exploration and combat. Clear out a base, will ya!

												Just Cause 2 is one of the most enjoyable games I’ve ever played, with nearly every piece of this game resonating with me on some level. From the narmy, b-movie aesthetic with stereotypical characters who love nothing more than to chew the scenery and a plot that seems like it was lifted directly out of a James Bond rip-off; to a stunningly beautiful, gargantuan tropical paradise to explore and destroy at my own pace; and finally to the ludicrous over-the-top action that unfolds at every single skirmish, this game left an indelible mark on me that few games have come close to matching.While the game’s story is about as shallow as it comes and lasts for only a handful of hours if you really wanted to push through the story, that’s not where the game’s fun lies; exploring, experimenting, and eradicating all that stands in your way at your own pace is the true joy. The game is absolutely massive; it will be dozens of hours before you even came close to completing a mere half of the map. Unfortunately, you may find this tedious after a while as many of the bases and villages are duplicates of each other. Thankfully, each quadrant of the island has a different aesthetic to it, from the sweltering, arid deserts to the bustling metropolitan areas to the snow-capped mountains to the tropical shores, the nation of Panau seems to have a little bit of everything. This will help to take the tedium out of the game.You will be wanting to spend time on this island, too. I cannot stress how wonderful and truly massive it feels; clocking it at roughly four hundred square miles, Panau is easily the largest world I’ve ever seen in an action video game. And while the visual style is not photorealistic, it does an absurdly exceptional job at creating a sense of scale. When skydiving for the first time, I was breathtaken at how small I felt in relation to the rest of the world.This feeling will never quite go away, even after hundreds of skydives. You will be doing a lot of skydiving; the parachute and grappling hook was my de-facto method of map traversal. It is a ludicrous way to travel in a ludicrous game; the larger-than-life action will be sure to excite. You can creatively destroy all that stands in your way through a combination of traditional weapons and vehicles to some non-traditional gadgets, such as the aforementioned grappling hook and some special secret agent toys to pilot and shoot. Shooting out tires, tethering enemies to moving cars and rockets, C4 detonations, and high-speed car chases where you rapidly negotiate your way around several still moving cars will become the commonplace.While the paper-thin excuse plot and repetitive nature of the game may leave a bad taste in many players’ mouths, I believe that the gorgeous environment and exciting action as well as the ability to set your own pace means that this game has definitely become one of my favorite games of all time.

												""It was worth every minute!"" - Rico RodriguezThis open-world game has one simple primary objective: blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up. No really it's just blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up topped with the occasional assassinations and fetch quests while 75% of the game really is just blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up in a beautiful coastal environment HOWEWER partially thanks to the unique gameplay gimmick that this game has blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up has never been so fun for me before.(And I also like blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up by default which makes me a maaaaaniac maaaaaniac I♥♥♥♥♥ume.)Add this the fact that this game is really well optimized (hence I can play it on mah potato with even 40 fps) and you've got yourself an explosive experience.P.S.: I can safely say that this is my favorite open-world game as of now.

Kilometers and kilometers of landscape, filled with enemy bases, cities and naval outposts where you can cause chaos. Explosions after explkosions. Get. It. Now. PLUS : A new multiplayer-mod just went out 2 months ago, it is great ! Free updating when you buy the game. And I dare you to try to achieve 100 %. Come on.			"

YouTube™ Video: Just Cause 2 [Game Review] 

			Views: 108		

			My review of the 2010 action open world game ""Just Cause 2"", published by Square Enix and developed by Avalanche Studios.		

Game: Just Cause 2Genre: Open World Third-person ShooterDeveloper: Avalanche StudiosPublisher: Square EnixCopy supplied by SteamJust Cause 2 is an open world action game developed by Avalanche Studios and published by Square Enix in 2010. This is the first of many reviews to come about the latest installments of franchises that are coming back in the near future.STORYYou play as Rico Rodriguez, one of the Agency's main operatives, as he is sent to the island of Panau to oust Panay from office, as well as track down and assassinate his old mentor, Tom Sheldon, who the Agency fears has gone rogue after disappearing during the regime change. In order to find Sheldon, Rico allies himself with the three dominant criminal gangs on the island: the Roaches, an organized crime syndicate, the Reapers, an insurgent Socialist militia and the Ular Boys, an ultranationalist rebel group that espouses traditionalism and opposes foreign influence.The story is over-the-top and the dialogue is really cheesy. The story serves only to justify you being a terrorist who destroys power plants, ventilation systems, dams, military bases and many more objects. Save for a few moments in the 7 Story Missions, it is not memorable.GRAPHICSEven though it has been 5 years since the game was first released, it still looks damn great on PC: the island is colourful, the explosions are vibrant, the draw distance is long and the water feels realistic. The only things that have always been the problem with the game are the facial textures and animations. Other than that, you will have a gorgeous experience that will run at 60fps even on a toaster.GAMEPLAYThe goal is to cause as much chaos as you can by destroying military facilities and everything related to that. Right from the get-go you can explore the 400 square miles of Panau, discovering the 368 locations, engaging in high-speed chases by water, plane or car, hijacking enemy vehicles to crash into oil rigs... There is a lot of variety in what you can do and how.The big game changer is the grappling hook, which can be used to gain speed while using your unlimited parachutes, to pull enemies from ledges, to attach a speeding vehicle to the ground so that it flies in the air, to attach an enemy to the ceiling and turning him into a human piñata, and so on. You can also carry three weapons (two sidearms, one big gun) and both grenades and sticky bombs.There is the black market, which can be used to order and upgrade weapons and vehicles, or as a way to fast travel. But I strongly recommend that, because each time that you go from one place to the other, you are bound to find an hidden collectible, a new location, or a new badass vehicle that you hadn't tried already. The side activities that you complete for the gangs are very similar to one another, and usually consist of escorting someone, finding an object in a base or destroying a base or two. There are also races that are varied and very fun to play. The game is a ton of fun, and you won't regret the time you'll spend with it.CHALLENGEThe game tends to be very challenging even on the easiest settings, thanks to strong and numerous enemies that will pursue you, as well as an unforgiving checkpoint system in the missions.SOUNDThe soundtrack is hugely underrated, but really strong and energizing, while the voice acting is one of the cheesiest since the original Resident Evil. But since it seems like they made that on purpose, I'll let it slide.The sound effects are great, with clear distinctions from one gun to the other, and with some hugely satisfying explosions.REPLAYABILITYA huge map, tons of collectibles, multiple missions and 50 Steam achievements are bound to make you play this game for a long time to come, especially if you are waiting for Just Cause 3's release.Overall, this is a phenomenal game to play, with an amazing open world, fluid and varied combat, multiple collectibles, strong soundtrack and beautiful vistas. This is a game that I love, and I strongly recommend buying to everyone who loves action games.

												Just Cause 2 is probably one of the best games I've played this year. It's got tons of action, tons of content, and an excellent (and huge) map to explore. And there's always something to do, be it completing missions for the different factions, doing some challenges, finding collectibles, or simply blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up. Oh, and it's got a storyline too.It improves a lot from the original game; for starters, the grappling hook is now more versatile, not to mention it's no longer counted as an extra weapon (although it's more effective as one than in the first game!). You can also combine it with the parachute, which gives a new way to move across the map; it might be tricky at first, but once you get to know the hook/parachute combo, you'll be using it a lot. The gunplay feels good as well, and while the driving is tricky at first (especially in cars), once you get used to it, it's very good as well.As for the environment, it's gorgeous. The Panau Islands are pretty varied; from dense jungles, to snowy mountains, river deltas, and even a huge desert! And they all look pretty good; the day and night cycle makes them even more beautiful, as it can create some fantastic  sunsets for you to enjoy. One of my favourite parts of the game was simply flying around in a helicopter doing some sightseeing. Another thing, the map itself is huge. Not only is there variety in environments, as I said, but there's many secrets to find as well, from collectibles, to some pretty cool easter eggs.When it comes to story, well, just like the first game, it's something that you'd expect from a cheesy action movie. Nothing bad, mind you, simply lots of action all over the place. And it's great! Explosions everywhere, gunfights on top of moving cars; it's got everything. And the last mission, in particular, is probably the most over the top action sequence I've ever seen, and it's the best part of the game. Really, you must get there and see it, as I don't want to spoil the fun.The game also has a cool soundtrack. Now, it's not like most open world games where you can listen to a radio station while driving; the soundtrack actually shows up during certain portions of the game, for example, when the military is chasing you, there's a pretty tense soundtrack playing. And the faction themes that play out after taking over a stronghold are also very good. The voice acting, well, it's interesting, for lack of a better word. I'm not sure if that's how accents from South East Asia are supposed to sound or not, but they did feel somewhat unique. And the dialogues from the main characters were also filled with cheesy one liners and such.As I already mentioned earlier, it also offers lots of stuff to do. Besides the main storyline (which is actually somewhat short, if you focus entirely on it), there's settlements to complete by finding collectibles and destroying stuff; there's three factions you can help out, doing missions for them and taking over strongholds; there's different challenges to complete; and, as I said, you can simply take your time and fly around creating some chaos, which, by the way, is essential to unlock storyline missions.Well, I don't know what more to write. All I can say is that I really enjoyed this game, and I hope that, if you get it, you enjoy it as much as I did.			"

												Ok I've only played 2 hours of this when writing this review, but played 100+ hours of JC2 on ps3 before. This is by far the BEST of all the Just Cause games. It's miles better than JC3 in terms of gameplay, mainly because, unlike in JC3, there is no compulsion to ""do everything"" to complete the story. Simply blowing stuff up and exploring at your own pace gives you so much more freedom than JC3 where it feels a lot more mechanical, with its ""do mission, liberate settlements, do another mission, rinse and repeat ad nauseum."" Yes, the voice acting and story in JC2 is utter tripe, but you don't get this game for that. You get JC2 because it is, frankly, an absolute joy to play.My only real problem is the confusing layout for controls, especially for flying vehicles like helicopters and planes, but apart from that this game is awesome.It runs on windows 10, and if it crashes at all for you, disable decals on the advanced display settings and that should fix it!

												Just Cause 2 is published in the year 2010 by the Eidos Interactive and it's the direct Sequel to Just Cause.Like it's Prequel,Just Cause 2 is an Open-World 3rd-Person-Shooter/Action Game.This is going to be a List of Pro's and Contra's about the second Game.Before i start,i highly recommend an XBOX-Controller! It fixes all Stearing Issues,even planes are awesome to play with it!!!Pro:-The Game has a HUGE(1000 square kilometres),beautiful and open Map.-The Story isn't innovative,but pretty funny and well made.-The Main Character is a cool,badass Agent who's always up for a Joke(ALWAYS!)!-There are tons of different Vehicles,from boats to cars,from helicopters to airplanes!-The controls are really easy to learn,after 10 minutes everybody should be able to play like an expert!-You can have it for 15€(About 20 Dollars!),and EVERYBODY has do admit that this is a hell of a low price!-You can waste hours just by running over the map and don't even start the Story(except for the first 2 Missions)-The Plane/Helicopter controls are awesome(except for the Si-47 Leopard Fighter Jet!)Contra:-The car/bycicle controls are not really good,only a few vehicles have good controls!-The Missions get boring after a while because they are always the same.So these were all the Points i had to say about the Game,and in my Opinion,it is definitely a Game everybody should own or at least had played it once!It is really fun,and it doesnt gets boring even after reaching 100% because of the huge Mod Community!I hope i could help you Guys with this Review!

												The voice acting is terrible and there is barely any story to it. But that is not why this game got a high rating and why it's highly recommended. The highlight of this game is the gameplay obviously. Your grapple hook and parachute get you anywhere at high speeds; you got an entire island to explore and the main goal of this game is to blow things up and cause chaos. As you progress you earn parts and money which you can use to upgrade weapons and grenades which really help you since they don't do much in the beginning. I haven't finished the story but that's my view so far...they explain...diddly squat. But it's still worth every penny since it really is one of the best games. Buy it!			"

												From the first mission I fell in love with Just Cause 2. I didnt play the first game and did expect a solid GTA clone in a Jungle/Tropical enviroment. The grappling hook however gives this game a rather unique gameplay. You can do a lot of crazy completly unrealistic stunts on land, sea and midair. After a while you realize that the missions are rather generic and one mission plays very much like the previous missions. However there is so much to explore, so many stunts to pull off and so many ways of killing the bad guys that you canget many hours of fun for small money. A definitve must buy if you can forgive the sometimes repetitive gameplay.			"

												The story and voice acting is tripe, but answer me this ... what other free roaming sandbox game allows you to skyjack a military jet and surf on the nose cone?  Just Cause 2 is a beautiful, fun and surprisingly well optimized rampage through a massive world that easily puts even MMORPGs to shame.  You can go anywhere, steal anything and the destruction of both property and watching a car you just tethered to a windmill as it tumbles through the air is beefy and satisfying.  The grappling hook in the game is easily the best tool in gaming since HL2's Gravity Gun, if not better.  It aids in traversing terrain easily, providing a ride when combined with your unlimited stunt parachute, or in combat with clever, hilarious ways using classic grappling, or tethering two things together, including people.  I highly recommend this game for its fun and destructive escapism, but if you're the type of person who can't enjoy a game without realism, you'd better just continue being boring.			"

This review is rather short because there is not much to cover why you should actually buy it. But I can say this game is well worth the hours if you like open world games and chaos.verdict.9/10earns my recommend.			"

 IT'S GOOD You, agent Rico Rodriguez, have the task to find and kill your old friend and mentor. He's missing in the island paradise Panau. To find him, destroy as much as you can. (Don't as me why. I understand it neighter)Just Cause 2 you're a nice open world game with awesome action, sounds and visual effects - but you are not a story game!++ BIG OPEN WORLD (more than 300 places to discover)++ fast travel++ nice vehicle variation (cars, trucks, boats, airplanes, jets...)++ very good sound++ the explosions are really breathtaking+ many challenges, group missions or objects to find+ lots of funny moments+ no hard achievements+ MULTIPLAYER - could be funny with friends (didn't played it yet)+ Just Cause+ You are like Spiderman with your hook+ It will take some time to complete all achievements (~ 40-50 hours)- 7 main missions? C'mon! That's nothing!- you don't play this game for the story, don't forget it!- short playtime for the main missions - 8 to 10 hours if you rush- AI enemies are easy to beat- some of the controls are...sh*t- I don't like Spiderman If you look for a very wide open world with a huge variety of weapons and vehicles - This is your game! You don't play Just Cause 2 for the story - you play it for the explosions and the really big world. If you can get it in a sale you can't make something wrong!I like you, Just Cause 2 - 8/10 "

												SO much fun. Just Cause 2 is the definitive throw-things-down-a-mountain simulator.I originally bought JC2 at full retail price on Xbox 360 after playing the demo for around 4 hours. It is one of the few games from recent memory that left me with no regrets of paying full price. The open world sandbox is mind blowingly massive and the amount of things to blow up is just mental. Combine that with the crazy gravity defying grappling hook+parachute traveling mechanics and not only is it a vast world but it’s enjoyable to traverse.I purchased the PC version solely for mods (infinite grappling hooks, multiplayer, etc.) and while I certainly wouldn’t drop another 60 bucks on it, the upgrade in hardware plus the ability to mod the game made the purchase well worth while.

												Just Cause 2 is like an exciting trip to a foreign country. You never know what to expect from the locales , or if the stuff you are currently eating includes 1 or more domestic animals inside it. Story:The Game has you starring as Rico, formerly known as ""Scorpio"", an buff, stereotypical white latino.Your job is being a♥♥♥♥♥♥to the self aclaimed new president ""Panay"", which is trying to distance panau, the island you play on, from the western world. He's doing that by the obvious way. Establishing his own dominance via painting every single combustable/explosive in his signature colours. Red and white. Why that is important ? You wont ask me again when you have already read this review further. Your Job is trying to ""Liberate"" Panau for 'murica'.Doing that is quite easy. Blowning up gas containers, facilities, military bases, all nice stuff.Gameplay:As you can guess, the game doesnt take itself too serious, however, this might not be as much of an flaw, as you might imagine in the first place. Did I mention that Rico has a Grappling hook ? No ? Well, in the context of the ""serious"" plot, Scorpio has this weird♥♥♥♥♥thingy, that allows him to do ridiculous stuff, like attaching two enemies onto each other , and giggle at their frustration, as they get smashed against each other, trying to get the hook loose, that is piercing through their flesh. Sounds like fun, now doesnt it, you jerk ? Well, to be honest, it is. It's a blast. Using the grapling hook to pull yourself onto vehicles, get around, or just do the before mentioned with cars, planes, boats..you get the Idea. On top of it all, you get  the most reliable parachute in the world. Using it in combination with your personal zipping device, you can fly through the air to get to new places, extent your life by a few more seconds, or dodge great threats all together.  As for the goal of the game, your job is to cause chaos. You do that via the before mentioned blowing up of important infrastructures, that are all conveniently marked by Panays Signature colours. By doing that, you will unlock more Items for the so called Black market. A mysterious delivery service, that is run by the "" Sloth demon"", and delivers everything you could ask for in a game like this, like cars, weapons,planes  aswell as extracting you too any previously discovered location. With the right amount of chaos, you will constantly unlock new stuff to buy there, and  if you're lucky enough to dfin new vehicle/ weapon parts on your journey, you can even go as far as upgrading the Items you buy from him. Havent I told you, how much this abscense of a real story brightens up the game ? See ? Awesome.I sincerely wish that there were more games like this.Graphics and PC performance, mods, and tweaking:Just cause 2 is an relatively old game, as you might have guessed already.That however doesnt keep it from having a solid technical build quality. The environment look nice, especially in places with a lot of fauna, Ricos clothing is very detailed, and nothing clips through him (*Cough* Assassins Creed*Cough*) , and the draw distance is very nice.Surprisingly enough, the water is looking awesome, if you have an corresponding Nvidia Card. I sugest atleast having an GTX 280, because it´s rendered via cuda cores, but it runs just as well on AMd cards of the same quality. For a DirectX 10 Game, the lighting is very beatiful, and eyecandy such as Godrays enhances the overall experience.Panau is very detailed, and optic fidelity can be found everywhere. from the harsh mountain tops, that are covered in snow, to the green jungle,small villages, and deserts, the game looks absolutely gorgeous.It´s colourful, cramped with detail, and fun to play in.As for the mod side of things, you can find a lot of interesting stuff besides all the cheats, vehicle, and weapon mods. Guessing that your PC is fast enough, I would sugest to Use Sweet FX, if I were you. Sweet Fx is a mod, which allows modern Anti Aliasing technologies, such as FXAA, and SGSSAA, to be forced into a game, which doesnt natively support said options. It also can be tweaked to your liking , and there are many user created presets for it, which enhance saturation, contrast, and overall optical Fidelity a lot.Speaking of optical enhancers, how well does the game actually run ? To be honest, it runs like a charm. my GTX470 always can keep up smooth 60 Frames per second, while having sweet FX, and the ingame MSAA to work with.there is no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t frame cap, no forced Vsync, a nice Field of view, and advanced graphical options, to tweak the game to your liking.Conclusion:Just Cause 2 delivers what it promises. Action without any compromises. It isnt held back by its serious plot, social commentary, or anything similar to those dfancy♥♥♥♥♥triple A Titles you always hear about. It´s just pure fun with an Story construct build beneath it. Did I even mention the multiplayer mod ? So far, all i can say is that I am really enjoying this game.It was definitely worth every cent I spend on it, and I can only give my recommendation for it to you. If you enjoy mindless action, hilarious situations, and all out rampages, then this game is for you. buy it.9.5/10 for racist Asian accents.			"

The physics engine is loose enough to let you have ridiculous amounts of fun with the game world and you can spend hours just exploring and wreaking havoc.

												Have played the game for all 4 years of its release across 3 platforms. I've never gotten 100% save. Says pretty much all you need to know. This game is a masterpiece, a masterpiece that takes more time to complete than the Mona Lisa took to paint. Collectibles are harder to find than an athiest in Saudi Arabia and Fuel Tanks are about as scarce as Conservative media outlets on the internet. 12/Bolo Santosi, Leader of the Revolutionary Army known as the Reapers would complete Oil Rigs again.

												I just finished playing Just Cause 3 and realized that I never wrote a review for this awesome game.Even though this game is 6 years old now, it has held up incredibly well. The graphics, while not anything special by modern standards, are still decent and the draw distances is still much better than 99% of the other games out there. The gameplay is still solid and plenty of fun.What really keeps drawing me back to this game time and again is the world. The map is absolutely gigantic by the standards of any game not using procedural map generation, and because it was hand built it is chock full of interesting content just inviting you to get out and explore (and cause random chaos while you're at it).Sure this game isn't perfect, the vehicle handling is pretty poor, the AI isn't anything special, the black market system has some issues (finite resources in game being the biggest one), chaos objects aren't shown on that map which makes finding the last one or two chaos objects extremely frustrating at times, and the story is barely passable (although it has some pretty epic set pieces), but these issues are forgivable since this game is simply so much fun to play, especially with the free multiplayer mod.Given how cheap this game is now and how much fun it still is (I consider it to be superior to JC3 in that regard), it is extremely easy to recommend.

												One of my favourite free roaming sandbox games.If Far Cry 2 and GTA IV had a baby with glorious five-o-clock shadow it would be this game.So much to do, hundereds of locations to discover and conquer, thousands of things to blow up with your extensive arsenal of weapons and vehicles (Land, Water, Air, but no Fire 0/10 would not bend)Multiplayer is pretty fun, but I honestly have put around 45 minutes into it.Controls can be a little wonky if you're used to third-person games on console (like me)Overall I'd give it 9/10 because the voice acting isn't really my cup of tea and some things can get a little repetitive.

												I love this game with a passion. Ignore the hours on my record, I played this game for hundreds more on the PS3.Why do I love it you may ask? Let me tell you a story of something that happened completely dynamically, as well as a pros and cons review of Michael Bay's Wet Dream: The Video Game~~~I had just purchased a rocket launcher that could fire four rockets at once from the black market. With this i decided to have a bit of fun. I was parachuting along when i saw a gas station, which i promptly blew up. The military then sent two squad cars and a man on a mortorcylce. I hopped on top of one care where a man was hanging out of the side shooting at me. I shot a grappling hook into his chest and tethered him to the other car where he was dragged along and ran over by a taxi cab. I rode on top of this car, shooting at the other car when i leaped onto the miltary motorcylce that was following us, tossing the soldier onto the ground so he could get run over by one of his fellow soldiers. I rode this away until i reached a four way intersection where i set several cars around, making my base. Everytime a car drove towards me i'd blow it up with the rocket launcher. This went on until I heard a radio signal saying ""We are dropping like flies! Send air support!"",  which is when I knew that the fun was only beginning. I grappled onto the first helicopter i saw, with a man hanging off of the side and shooting at me. I shot him in the face then threw the driver out onto the ground. I then began attacking their other helicopters with my own. This was only the beginning.Another two helicopters showed up, these ones with heat seaking missiles. I was shot down and parachuted into a nearby jungle. A couple men on motorcycles chased me into the forest where i was riding a bike of my own, zig-zagging through the trees. This chase continued until we reached a cliff. I drove off the cliff and gracefully leaped off of the flaming bike and soared through the air. I landed on a nearby highway where some rebels were attacking more miltary. I ran up to join in the fight when i got shot with a shotgun once, killing me and ending my run. tl;dr I was badass.~~~PROS: +Beautiful asthetically speaking.+COLOSSAL map.+Fun, action packed gameplay. +Cheesy and hilarious(ly bad) dialogue (intentionally so as to bring back memories of cheesy 80's action B movies).+Cheesy story (intentionally so as to bring back memories of cheesy 80's action B movies).+Lots of easter eggs.  (Including the entire island from ""LOST"") CONS:-Short Campaign.-""AH HE GOT ME WITH HIS WIRE TING!""			"

Product received for free
												IntroductionI am Tigerfrost. I would like to apologize for anything that is miss-spelled or any grammar issues. Thank you.If you'd like to skip straight to Pro's & Con's, please move to the bottom of the page. Thank you.How I Found Out About ""Just Cause 2""The same way I found out about a lot of games, from YouTube. I randomly came across a video that was showing someone driving a vehicle off of a tall snowy mountain. The crash and destruction effects made me fall in love. See, I've always loved destruction in games/movies/etc. So when I see something like that, I know I must own the game. Unfair First ImpressionsI've seen a lot of different unfair first impressions for this game. The first, and most simple being, the fact that someone may not have liked the original Just Cause game. Therefor it leads to an automatic thought that any sequel will be just as bad, or worse. I can understand this, but believe me, Just Cause 2 makes everything better. Second, I've heard that the game can get low reviews and less players because of it's story. I know some people are looking for games for their story. However, not everyone is. You can have a game like Just Cause 2 where the story is bad but the gameplay is good, very good. Third, because it's a third person shooter style of game. Which can turn some people away. Review Of ""Just Cause 2""Just Cause 2 is a massive open world, sandbox, TPS game, that comes with a full story, side missions, bonus missions, and so many collectables that you'll die before finding all of them. The world of Just Cause 2 is massive (Panau). One of biggest I have ever seen! Stretching across desert terrain and mountains, snowy mountains and terrain, jungle and marsh, ocean, urban areas, and military bases. One downside to the world of Just Cause 2 is that it may be very big, but it's not well populated with stuff. Meaning, all that jungle and desert, 90% of it will not have anything in it besides sand and trees. So you may find the world itself being very boring at times. However, the rest of the game makes up for that. In the world of Just Cause 2, there are urban areas to explore. Villages that may hold resources and ammo to big cities that contain higher costing vehicles & helicopters. Places like airports where you can obtain a passenger jet. There are military bases you can liberate by destroying & collecting all things within it. These bases could consist of ports, vehicle factories, little infantry camps, to big fortress type places. You can get around the world of Just Cause 2 with many things. First of all, you can use your grappling hook to get to higher places, then you can use your parachute to glide down or travel across land faster. Not only is that the most basic of travel, there are vehicles...a lot. There are a little over 100 vehicles in Just Cause 2. Anything from ATV's, motorcycles, cars, trucks, boats, armored cars, planes, helicopters, etc. The list goes on. One thing that I do not care for in the vehicle department is the vehicle physics. The vehicle isn't really that responsive, or reliable. You can hit the movement key lightly and the vehicle will spin out, even at low speeds. You can defend yourself with weapons like SMG's, shotguns, etc. There really aren't many weapons to use in the default game unless you purchase DLC. However, there is still so much content in the game, you don't actually need DLC so the DLC is just there for bonus weapons & vehicles. I would like it if Just Cause 2 had more weapons in the default game. With how big the world is, having more weapons gives you more options to do things with.This isn't really the game that plays like a TPS game. You don't run up to a base and get behind cover then start attacking. The AI is kind of stupid, and the same time, they work well. There really isn't any stealth. The concept behind Just Cause 2 is that you drive in for fly in, kill everything, and walk away from a massive explosion. As for the story and side missions. The story itself is generic and not really exciting, except for the final mission. There are only six missions I believe, maybe more. However, to unlock story missions you must gain chaos which can be obtained by destroying key points in military bases, fighting the military, collecting things, or completing side missions. There are a lot of side missions to choose from three different sub factions who you'll find fighting the military at times. The side missions themselves can actually be unique and fun, however the briefing itself is low. Every mission start, you'll stand there and the leader of the sub faction will drive by, tell you what you need to do, and then drive away. Not a word said. Don't get me wrong, Just Cause 2 is a great game, it just may not be what you are looking for.Content In Just Cause 2 (Bonus Missions & Collectables)In the world of Just Cause 2, you have bonus missions alongside ""side missions"". These mainly consist of races, for all vehicle types. Other then that, you have thousands of collectables. These can be little pickups for the sub factions, or little resource crates that boost your stats, like giving you weapon parts to upgrade your weapons, or armor parts to give you more health, etc. To gain 100% in Just Cause 2 requires you to collect every piece of sub faction items and resources, also, destroying key military structures in an area. Each area you discover will give you a progress bar, when everything has been collected or destroyed, the progress bar will reach 100% and that area is clear. However, the PC version of Just Cause 2 experienced a bug where a few items & structures do not spawn in the game. Therefor it is impossible to beat the game 100% without a mod. The devs apparently do not care to fix this easily fixed problem. Pro's & Con's (Overall Rating)Just Cause 2 is an open world TPS that provides a wide variety of collectables and fun destruction. You can spend hours on the game before ever reaching 15% for full completion. Despite needing a mod to fully beat the game 100%. There has alos been a community mod released that allows people to play together in the world of Panau. Pro's:+Massive open world.+Loads of collectables for hours of game time.+Fun destruction system.+Addicting ""I must find everything"" style.+DLC is not required to play.+Nice variety of vehicles.Con's:-Mod needed for full completion.-Enemy will spam helicopters.-Mostly boring empty world. -Strange vehicle mechanics.-Low leveled main story & side mission briefing.Overall Rating: About A 12/15 (A Nice Game That's Worth A Pickup)Credits & DisclaimerThank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope this helped out with your decision on whether to make a purchase or not.Remember, this review is based off of opinion only. You may not think the same way as me towards something, but that's okay, because we are all human.			"

												I've played Just Cause 2 originally on xbox 360 and put more than 20+ hours into it. Panau is a big beautiful island with lots to see and as Rico AKA The Scorpio as your tour guide. Rico is a mercenary looking for someone on the island and is drafted to help local gangs reign chaos in an attempt to complete his own personal mission.Just Cause 2 follows somewhat of a GTA game play scheme. Notable differences include driving and the obvious attachment of a hook shot / grapple. This grapple is what makes Just Cause, Just Cause. This thing can literally attach to anything within a certain distance. This includes automobiles, helicopters, buildings, boats, trees, mountains and literally anything you can think of. Upon grappling onto a car, Rico can perform ""stunt jumps"" in which he is able to maneuver himself on and around the car. This comes handy in case you are being fired at and need some extra cover. When attaching oneself to a helicopter, Rico can chill underneath or just like a car, attempt to hijack it. There are a few QTE (quick time events) that need to be performed in order to successfully high jack any moving vehicle. You can also grapple enemies if you're really feeling it. Alternatively, Rico can attach his grapple to two objects. Say you want to shoot at an explode-able object but it's not quite close enough to the enemies. Rico can shoot his grapple at the barrel and then attach it nearby or on the enemy. Once the barrel is shot and starts flying, the grapple will pull it towards the enemy. It's an extremely cool feature but with a few flaws. If you're trying to get cars that pass by to run into it, it doesn't really work. For one reason or another the game made it so you cannot simply have people running into the grapple. What you may do though is use it against cars or helicopters. Being chased? Not a problem. Attach to the car then attach to the road or any tree that's nearby and watch them flip. Driving is sort of it's own unique thing in the game. When the car is flipping over multiple times I like how they did that effect, but I do not like how they made the driving scheme. It seems a little stiff and controls sometimes don't react as you want them to. Shooting is quite basic in the game and auto-targeting seems welcomed.You may zoom in while shooting and even dual wield certain weapons. Weapons can be swapped for different weapons and three slots are available to fill up. Smaller automatics and pistols can swapped out for one another (one slot). Bigger shotguns or automatics can be switched (second slot). The third slot consists of grenades or C4 (both which can be carried at the same time). Shooting is decently fun but can get old. You can crouch and roll to evade fire from enemies but there is no real cover system. It would have been nice if they added something like Gears of Wars has in regards to taking cover. What is notable in this game is that lots can be blown up. Sadly, it's not on a Mercenaries 2 : world in flames sort of demolition (which I think to this date is still the best) but JC2 still has it's moments. There is fun in mindless violence of blowing entire enemy bases up (from radio towers, electrical stations, gas tanks, enemy vehicles and towers). What you can do damage to is sort of limited. In Mercenaries 2 you could blow up an entire oil rig. In JC2, that oil rig has only certain aspects you can take out. Whether this is good or bad is determined by you. By pressing down on the D-pad you may call up ""the sloth demon"" aka your personal distributor of weapons, vehicles and extraction if needed. They really gave the player a chance to enjoy a wide variety on their menu but most unlock only after a certain amount of progress has been made (be it collecting crates, completing missions or blowing government equipment up). Anything here also costs a pretty penny!The game is known for it's beautiful graphics especially demonstrating the beauty of being able to encapsulate the entire island in the background. Even though it's not the next gen sort of graphics, it still provides for an enjoyable sight to see. The display for the weapon meters are excellently done. Even though you may run out of ammo a lot, you'll know exactly how much you have left.  Sounds are varied (explosions are finally sounding different) and comments are made by either Rico, enemies and even civilians. They organized the map in a way that is extremely easy to figure out where you are and where you want to go. They were even kind enough to indicate where potential hidden locations could be. Overall, a fantastic game. Even with a few minor flaws the gamer is sure to enjoy Just Cause 2.RATING : 7.9/10Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B Overall  BWould have been 8 if they fixed a few grappling issues. Not only that, if you hit a civilian full throttle in a truck they won't fall off their bike. They just bounce away in the air. Kinda weird ain't it?ScreenShots Do you like helicopters Be quick on your toes when the QTE's turn up Do you like fighter planes This is actually a lot funner than it looks Do you like commercial airliners that is on fire "

												Just Cause 2 is an incredibly big open world game, where you try to help the American government to change the dictator from having all the power and to stop opressing his people. To do that, you are helped by the ""agency"", the secret service you belong to and three different rebellion factions. They all give you missions that consist most of the times in destroying huge military facilities. You can drive every single vehicle in the game and shoot pretty much every imaginable weapon. You also have a complete freedom on how to do the missions, although I don't think you can do them stealthy, I never tried, but if you buy this game you won't want to sneak around anyways.The huge island the game takes place on is called Panau and you have every imaginable landscape on it. There is a desert, mountains, woods etc... All of these landscapes are accessable with the unique gadjet given to you: the graplehook. It allows you to climb and get wherever you want and is a great solution for such a complete game.The best feature of the game however, is the multiplayer. It is completely free and you can do tons of cool stuff with your friends in there. Did I mention that it is free?So if you like open world games, explosions, great open world multiplayer explosions and tanks and jets and explosions...BUY THE GAME!			"

												This game is best at what it does not point you to, sure there will be some marker to a miscellaneous copy and paste faction mission, promising you black market items and another mission but what makes this game shine is it's ludicrously glorious destruction that it allows you to partake in, this game will leave you to hours of falling, driving and shooting to such a level of freedom and accessability that it is a no brainer to buy this. seriously, buy it you sadist. As mentined before the missions themselves are very rarely enjoyable and fall flat half of the time, however the main storyline agency missions do have their moments.			"

												Quite possibiliy the most entertaining game around, even though it's several year old it doesn't feel it.  Great graphics and gamepla to suit a James Bond film.  Whether you're grappling onto a flying plane, placing explosives on top, parachuting off and detonating them or hijaking a convoy of military cars everything is great fun.  The movement and actions are smooth and work well together.Throughly reccommended.			"

												In general I can recommend this game. It offers a huge area with different, let's say, ""climatic zones"". You will be able to visit a snowy land, a desert, islands and a temperated climate lands of Panau. What's more, there are a lot of villages and cities to explore, including the capital city. All this covered in well-made graphic going hand in hand with nice optimalization. Breathtaking landscapes were the best in my oppinion.Rico, the protagonist, can use a lot of weapons to spread destruction and fire. Carabines, shotguns, grenade launchers, regular grenades... there are many of them, you will surely find one that's suitable for you.Apart from the main campaign offering spectacular missions that are like from the best action movies, there are a lot of sidequests connected with different factions of Panau. I won't tell you their names as for I don't want to spoil.In the beginning of this review I wrote ""in general I can recommend..."". I wrote it, because it's true, but not only. I'd like to write about some things I didn't like. Firstly, many missions that are repetitive and make you think as if you were doing it for another time. Second thing - from circa middle part from the game it got boring for me. It takes too much time to get destruction points to unlock next main quest and exploring is not as appealing as it was before.I haven't played multiplayer yet, so I won't write about it, although I heard from my friends that it's good.Generally speaking, there are more positives about this game than negatives, that's why I can boldly recommend it as a good, well-made and beautiful looking product.

												So much action! This is like I'm in a cheesy Arnold Schwarzenegger/ Rambo movie, but in a good way. I play for hours and it's just so addicting. What makes it even more fun is when you install mods for the game like the superman mod. The story might not win any awards but the gameplay does. But honestly, I don't play for the story, I play more for the sandbox expirience and multiplayer. I mean come on! Have you ever tried finshing the game? It's one of the longest games I have ever played. Is there a point to read this review? Now go away and buy Just Cause 3! (No advertising intended)			"

												Nice alternative to GTA IV and its more realistic approach. This is B-movie over the top action and plot. Story is awful, but the grappling hook is one of the most fun weapons there is in a sandbox game. Highly recommend buying the aerial pack as well with the parachute thrusters. Must have tool for the game IMO. PC version is way better of course due to mods and the ability to use many more grappling lines unlike the consoles which only allow one.This game is a blast and you will be very happy you bought it as a sandbox fan. I have owned this on both PS3 and the PC and love it to death. Anytime you want some mindless destruction, or to fly around without the use of a vehicle, just a parchute and a grappling hook this game will deliver.			"

												A nice little timewaster for a couple of hours and then you'll never pick it up again.I'm not very familiar with this series but as a fan of the sandbox genre I was immediately hooked by the fun gameplay and appealing graphics. It's incredibly appealing to just mess around, cause havoc and experiment with the various gameplay mechanics but the initial enjoyment doesn't last long. As you start to discover the impressively sized island with various vehicles and gadgets it quickly dawns on you that the developers went for quantity over quality here. Every design element and situation is repeated ad nauseam and there is no variety to the environments which is of course due to the nature of the game world being set in a fictional asian setting (that admittedly made me want to go on vacation in thailand and cambodia again) but I have to ask myself the question why the developers didn't choose a more intriguing setting with variety. Perhaps the idea was to get away from the genre-defining GTA series; but nowadays sandbox games have generally gone far beyond GTA clones and are rightfully recognized as a genre of its own, so much so even GTA-clones as the first Saints Row develop a completely unique identity as they progress.The main problem with all the gadgets and functions in Just Cause 2 is that they are all introduced at the beginning of the game and while they are a lot of fun and give the game a unique flavour there isn't anything left to discover after the first hour or two. Surprised enjoyment followed by sobering grinding.The storyline department is also severely lacking, not that these games are usually poetic masterpieces but I can't even remember a single character, as in what is their name and character. I have no investment in short-haired action man with hookshot and thus didn't continue playing once the novelty wore off. The game is too self-aware for its own good ( not self-aware funny like Saints Row alas): nameless person in nameless setting against nameless antagonists. They have names but it never matters for a second; despite the beautiful visuals you never feel like you are traversing a real world, and even a cartoonishly over the top world can feel credible/plausible if it's internally consistent and has proper world building to draw you in. This felt more like a licensed game of one of those god-awful expendables movies.In that sense Just Cause is the epitome of a sandbox, you get nothing out of it that you don't bring yourself and you have to figure out your own way to have fun, namely smashing things together. Which is fine I guess but it comes off more like the developers couldn't be asked to do that themselves. They clearly have the skills to make all the mechanics of a sandbox game work but they don't add anything to it.If you can get this one on sale, you're gonna have fun for a little while but don't expect a memorable experience, Just Cause 2 is a distraction more than an experience.

												A just cause of 'just because'.One of the classical overly-explosive action games, this game is a great throwback to the old 80's Rambo-esque movies and mixes traditional third person destruction derby with open world (group of islands) adventure. A tropical GTA of sorts. The basic gameplay consists of destroying evil goverment's property, i.e. water and fuel supplies in random villages, races with every medium possible and both storyline and faction quests. As mentioned earlier, this game embraces the goofy righteousness and lets you wreak havoc upon both the goverment and its civilians with little difference.Technically this game is a port from original PS3 game, but from my experience it runs great. Even on my laptop I had stable performance on lower graphical settings and the game looks still fantastic for a game of its age (in my mind that's yesterday). The positive points of this game lie in it's great map design, freedom of gameplay done right (main story is there to create atmosphere and not to restrict features) and a certain kind of 'comfyness' if you're weird enough to get nostalgic about games of this era. (I could also talk about personal experiences I have when this game came out and I played a ton of it w/ my friend but buzzwords are way cooler.) I think Just Cause 2 does what it does so well that I'm probably never going to buy another game that tries to accomplish the same. (For me this is a big deal, especially since the third part of the series just came out)There aren't much negative stuff for me to say. The game has it's bugs and flaws, but for me it would be such a nitpick on stuff that didn't affect my experience. The world is so huge and detailed that finding incomplete pieces feels more like an easter egg than letdown. It does what it promises well, but for people who want a more sensible plot and structural gameplay this might be a short experience.			"

												Lately I really like open world games, aswell as this one. You're free to do whatever you want, and this is all about causing chaos ! What do you want more ? I'm going for 100 % in this game and maybe all the achievements - but yeah; this game is pure fun, cause chaos, kill those damn cops - seriously, I've never hated cops so much like in this game. Don't forget the grapple is the funniest thing: have a wrecking ball, play piñata, go/fly anywhere you want, attach someone to your car/helicopter and fly/drive around with someone and much, much, much more !Next to that you have unlimited parachutes and last but not least the map is f*cking huge = more fun !The main story is a bit short and if you complete it you have around 25 % game completion but ... enough time to do more stuff and to reach that 100 % game completion !PS: I want a grapple hook in real life.

												When I first got this game in 2010 when it first came out, I spent 4 months playing it non-stop. It may not be appealing compared to other games these days, but it is surely worth it. It has one of the largest maps I've ever seen. Plenty of vehicles and weapons. There is also endless destruction around the map. The country in the game is ruled with tyranny. Military outposts are scattered and you can destroy them all. The missions are pretty fun, but are not most interesting. This game has one of the best open world experiences ever. With extreme variation in environments, such as snowy alpine mountains to dense rainforests to all-out desert. With the new mod developed by the community that enables multiplayer, you can have a blast with your friends and family. This game is super affordable on Steam and is a definite necessity for your library!			"

You can skydive, roam, and explore the limitless amount of geographical places for instance, a forest, ocean, plains and more. Don't get me wrong, but for some reason, this game reminded me of GTA.

												Crazy-huge game.  Fun for a while but starts to get rather tedious if you're going for a completionist run.  Took me 82 hours to get to the max 99.95% completion.  For new buyers, the game is bugged and you cant actually get 100% without a mod.  Overall fun game, good missions, but terrible driving physics.  Flying on the other hand is a blast.  And i love how there are vastly different climates throughout the island.7.5/10			"

												Just Cause is a lot like Far cry. Except it knows it's a game. And it knows it's meant to be fun. And Explosions are fun. As are infinite parachutes on demand. As is a grappling hook that barely adheres to basic physics. And cars that become warheads should you jump out of them whilst they're moving. This game is fun.			"

												I've played this game on the Xbox 360 , and now finally I've got my hands on the PC version. This has to be one of the best open world games out there , the visuals are just stunning. There are around 7 main missions and 50 faction missions and a lot of collectibles to be found in this game to keep you busy . Definitely worth playing.+Great Graphics.+ Hours worth of gameplay.+ Big map with different areas .+ 100+ Vehicles which include Cars, Bikes , Helicoptors , Boats and Planes.-Bad voice acting.			"

												First of all, this game is my favorite of all time and I've played about over 250 hours of it and I still play it. This is a very good game, definitely worth it price. You have complete freedom over what you want to do, when you want to. The story was too short, the plot was terrible, and the voice acting was atrocious. You must also know that THIS IS A SANDBOX GAME. You make your own fun, and if you're creative enough, you'll love this game. Graphics: 10/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Fun factor: 10/10 Badassness: 10/10. Overall: 100000/10. I mean 10/10.[UPDATE]Yeah... This was the first review I wrote, and I've noticed how it lacks a few details.So here I go.The story in this game is short, and not too entertaining. Most gamers will tell you that the story is terrible, but it's actually not too bad, even if it IS very repetitive.The thing with this game is the free roam open world gameplay. It has a feel of freedom like no other games ever. The ""grappling hook+parachute"" combo is terrific if you want to move quickly and easily. You can drive cars, boats, planes, helicopter, jets. You can grapple a statue head to an attack chopper, pilot the chopper, blow up a few fuel shafts on the run, drop the statue head on a car, aim the chopper to a tower, eject from the chopper, watch it blow the crap up, parachute down to the ground, pick up a RPG, blow the crap out of every car, plane, chopper, whatever, grapple to a car, go full speed on the highway until you reach a ramp, jump up to the sky, eject from the car, grapple to a plane, get the pilot out of his seat, take over with a grand ending with a beautiful sunset over Panau Island.

												I almost didn't play Just Cause 2. Twice. The first time was before buying it. I hesitated because of how huge everyone made the game world seem. The impression I got was that there was more to do here than every Elder Scrolls combined. And I didn't want to make that kind of a time commitment. But when it went on sale it was too cheap to pass up.After intsalling and trying to start the game is when I almost gave up a second time. I couldn't get the game to run for more than about 5 mintues without crashing. That meant I would race desperately to get to the next checkpoint before the game crashed. I couldn't pause or explore or do anything but rush blindly ahead. Even on normal you can't do that without dying though. So I gave up for a while and played some other games, hoping for a patch or some explanation.Eventually, months later I tried again, but the game hadn't been patched and probably wasn't ever going to be. So I researched some fixes. Nothing seemed to work. The two biggest recommendations were to run in Windows 7 compatability mode and to turn off decals. Neither worked. BUT I got lucky and just decided on a whim to do both at the same time. The first time the game ran for 15 minutes without crashing I almost cried. Then I made it to an hour. More. So luckily, that combination fixed it for me. But the real shame of this game is that I almost missed it entirely because of such a horrible beginning experience and having to manually change things to get it to even run.Once it did run though, it was an awesom experience. In a word: fun. And really just plain, simple, fun. The first two tutorial-heavy story missions are actually a bad opening to the game, even though they introduce all the necessary concepts. They're too linear. Too narrow. The best part about Just Cause is how open and free and spontaneous the world is. The story missions largely lack all of that. The controls also took some getting used to. Having dodge be tab - an awkward button to hit repeatedly - and aim be C - something I've never encountered before - threw me for a while. Eventually I did get used to the controls though and I couldn't find a mapping I liked more than the default one. There's just a learning curve and you have to power through it.In the open world and used to the controls, the game shines. Largely because there is a lot to do, but you don't even have to do any of it. I spent my first 10 hours or so just exploring and causing chaos and searching for items. And it was addictive. And fun!Then I moved on to the races. I didn't expect them to be good, but with only a few exceptions (i.e. plane flights through cities and driving on snow) I found the racing to be insanely well executed. I looked forward to completing all of them and beat all 75 even though I didn't have to.The faction missions are also fun, although I realized that the shorter they were, generally the better. Just Cause seems to be meant for bite-sized play, with a short rise and fall of action. The longer missions, whether story related or not, were where the game suffered.And the story itself is terrible. The writing, voice acting, all horendous. There are as many accents as there are voice actors, and most of them don't sound like any kind of real accent at all. It's quite jarring until you get used to it. But in some ways this actually works in the game's favor, because it reminds you not to take it seriously.So if you want a third person action game akin to GTA but even bigger and less serious (though maybe a bit less absurd than something like Saints Row) Just Cause is the place to get it.

												A fun game that is worth getting while on-sale. It kinda is like the GTA series, but the world isn't exactly as big as in the Grand Theft Auto games. The car movement can be a bit weird in the beginning, if you are used to games like GTA. The missions are okay, and so is the gameplay. You can get creative and do a lot of fun stuff with the 'wire thing' that you have . Then there comes the multiplayer. You can have a great time if you have some friends to play this with.  The game requirements aren't really that big, but the graphics aren't bad.All in all, this is a game that is totally worth picking up on sale, and if you'll also get some of your friends to get it, you're gonna have some fun!

												Just Cause 2 is probably one of the most eye catching action sandboxes going; thrust into the large sandbox of Panau by parachute you are the stereotypical CIA one man wonder weapon which will tame the hostile regieme for good old uncle sam. But in honesty you do not buy Just Cause 2 for its depth, but rather for the action, the carnage, the pretty explosions, and the pleasant vistas of Panau itself. In many respects Just Cause 2 builds on the premise of Mercenaries and Mercenaries 2; joinable factions, main story missions, side missions, supply drops, vehicle drops, weapon upgrades and the ever present regieme installations, bases, airfields and towns that can be taken one at a time. Either going in solo or working for the various opposition factions does make you feel like you are toppling the regieme one satisfying step at a time. Also be pleasantly surprised by excellent frames per second on the highest of graphics settings; one of the most visually stunning yet stable platforms made for the PC.			"

												I kind of hated  and found the game frustrating at first, especially the annoying 2nd mission with the car surfing, but once you get past that it starts to get a little better and becomes quite fun and addicitive, can't stop playing even though it gets  repetitive and sometimes feels tedious with terrible voice acting, terrible story, no depth. Game would crash often until I turned off decals and blur. But still game crashes at least once or twice a play session.Sure you can purchase vehicles, but it seems like a waste of money, I bought a plane having never flown one yet and not even being sure of the controls, ended up crashing it into the ocean, so goodbye to 60k and  if you die you lose them as well, if they blow up they are gone for good. I hate how you can't store purchased vehicles anywhere. I've played other games where you can save your vehicles in a garage even if they blow up. I just don't bother buying vehicles.The environment is beautiful and detailed, I love exploring it and diving underwater just because the water looks so nice.I like creating chaos and trying to complete all achievements.I'd rate it 7/10. Worth getting on special like I did.			"

												There really isn't much I need to say about this game. I've sunk hours in on console and on PC, and it is a fantastic open world game. People are going to compare it to Grand Theft Auto, of course, and while in some areas you can, you really can't in others. The map is unbelievably large, and the storyline itself advances through ♥♥♥♥ing up everything you come across in whatever way you deem necessary for it to come down or explode. You can grapple all over the place and you have unlimited parachutes plus the ability to steal ANY vehicle in this game - if it moves, you can steal it. Anything from little bikes up to massive jet liner airplanes.Do I recommend this game? Hell yes. This is the most fun you will ever have in an open world setting. No restrictions, no linear story crap (unless you REALLY want to, and even then it's pretty damn open), just good old fashioned fun.			"

												Imagine an open world bigger than GTA V's Los Santos. Then picture a man grappling to every building in sight and swooping above people's heads with his parachute, shooting them from above and just generally causing a whole lot of paperwork for the government. That's the basic premise of this game.The goal of Just Cause 2 is to basically cause as much chaos as you can in order to overthrow the government of a small island called Panau. The game has a main story and a whole lot of side missions, but it takes so long to get from one story mission to the next you basically forget what the story's about. But who cares when you can obliterate everything in sight? Certainly not me.If you like large open worlds and Michael Bay-style action, this game is for you.			"

												Just Cause 2 is all you could want in an open world island adventure. You star as Rico Rodriguez, a man with the task of assassinating his former mentor who has turned crazy. Along the way you will meet several groups of revolutionary armies, such as the Reapers and the Ular Boys, who will send you on missions to hack military bases, takeover strongholds or assassinate colonels. The game is fast-paced and action packed. The main highlights of the game I found were the grappling hook and parachute. Rico is equipped with these from the get-go, and aiming at a certain spot on the ground with the grapple will send you flying off into that direction. Together with the easily deployable parachute, you hardly need cars to travel around the island of Panau.A minor downside to this game is the loading times. You will be left waiting awhile before entering the world, but is all worth it once in. One feature that is very helpful is the addition of the Black Market. Call for a chopper if you need weapons, vehicles or need to be flown to any previously discovered location (very helpful for Stronghold Takeovers). There are not an excessive amount of weapons in the game, ranging from the light and common pistol and submachine gun, to more powerful guns like shotguns and detached mounted guns (with insanely helpful infinite ammunition).There are also a large array of vehicles available to steal and hijack, from the cheap rusty Tuk-Tuk all the way up to the Chevalier 999. You can also find tanks, fully loaded with unlimited ammo of guns and autocannons, as well as helicopters and planes with the like.Overall, Just Cause 2 is an aesthetically astounding, open world adventure, and Avalanche Studios has done an amazing effort at pulling off a gaming spectacle. If you like a game where one minute you are parachuting out of the sky and next minute you are speeding down the deserted Panauan highway with the cops on your tail, this game is for you. The amount of things to do and see are amazing, and I thoroughly enjoyed this game and will be playing it for a lot more hours to come.			"

												Great Game filled with action, excitement, and adrenaline. It's easily a temprary replacement for GTA 5 (in the meanwhile for PC Gamers) and is very fun to have overall. The mods for the game add additional excitement to the game, such as The Multiplayer Mod, which brings in 1,200 (more or less) players in one world to play and have fun. The Single-Player mods though are what bring this game to the peak, especially in 2013-2014 year, bringing in chracter models, weapons, and other goofy things that just bring this game to the top of the level. Be warned though, you will NOT care for Single-Player story, due to he fun that's brought from the PC Gamers/Modders and fellow players in the game.Easily a 9.5/10 type of game.			"

												There really isn't much I need to say about this game. I've sunk hours in on console and on PC, and it is a fantastic open world game. People are going to compare it to Grand Theft Auto, of course, and while in some areas you can, you really can't in others. The map is unbelievably large, and the storyline itself advances through ♥♥♥♥ing up everything you come across in whatever way you deem necessary for it to come down or explode. You can grapple all over the place and you have unlimited parachutes plus the ability to steal ANY vehicle in this game - if it moves, you can steal it. Anything from little bikes up to massive jet liner airplanes.Do I recommend this game? Hell yes. This is the most fun you will ever have in an open world setting. No restrictions, no linear story crap (unless you REALLY want to, and even then it's pretty damn open), just good old fashioned fun.			"

												Imagine an open world bigger than GTA V's Los Santos. Then picture a man grappling to every building in sight and swooping above people's heads with his parachute, shooting them from above and just generally causing a whole lot of paperwork for the government. That's the basic premise of this game.The goal of Just Cause 2 is to basically cause as much chaos as you can in order to overthrow the government of a small island called Panau. The game has a main story and a whole lot of side missions, but it takes so long to get from one story mission to the next you basically forget what the story's about. But who cares when you can obliterate everything in sight? Certainly not me.If you like large open worlds and Michael Bay-style action, this game is for you.			"

												This game pushes the limits of open world sandbox games. The map is absolutely enormous and beautiful. Each terrain (dense jungle, desert, frozen mountains, ocean, urban) are expansive and fun to explore.The missions in the game are fairly brief, and can be beaten in a day. Despite this, you can still put hours into this game with just exploration. There is also a multiplayer mod in development that adds a whole other level of fun.This game is exceptionally well optimized as well. It runs on almost any machine with a decent frame rate, and adapts to any resolution flawlessly.My only gripes are that the gameplay gets a bit repetitive after finishing the main story, but if you are good at making your own fun and are willing to download a few mods, you can enjoy this game for a long, long time.8/10			"

The new free multiplayer DLC caught my attention, the idea of the occasional foray into pure exploding, gunfire and mayhem was interesting.Its very entertaining so far. There is a story / plot line but you have no need to rush into it. Very good game for simple idea of blow up, shoot, torment your enemy.The grappling hook and things you can do with it are amazing, your imagination can lead to many humorous for you moments, sheer torment for the enemy...Totally worth it.

												Oft rumoured but they say that if you look up the dictionary definitions for ""ridiculous"", ""marvellous"", or ""sheer unbridled insanity"", you'll find that Just Cause 2 is a suggested alternative. With a more than generous helping of hopefully intentional B-movie voice acting, JC2 (also know as EXPLOSIONS!: The game) is a vast physics-defying experience with a throwaway plot, fun-for-the-hell-of-it missions (a remarkable finale not to be missed) and a huge open world to satisfy your destructive needs.

""DON'T BLAME ME, IT WAS A DESIGN FLAW""What would you like me to say on this intouchable completition of 100%? Jaws down.If I say it's huge, it actually is. You cannot even imagine how huge it is. I've never ever played at a BIGGER game world than Panau is yet. It's so big that Panau contains desert, jungle and snowy mountains. It'll take you at least 10 minutes to jet it over and over 5 hours to walk across the map. While GTA takes you like 2 mins to jet it through, and 2,5 hours to walk it across. Both is confirmed guys, not just random number.Complexity of things you can do here? GTA Series are nothing in comparision with this. There is over 350 towns and villages to explore and liberate, more than 120 military bases to liberate, explore and destroy, those contains big airports, harbors, radar stations and so on. More than 100 cars and planes to drive. More than 2000 items to collect. If you want to reach 100% completition it is almost impossible. You gotta work your♥♥♥♥♥off and you still won't reach that without modding the game because 6 items out of 2000 are missing. I am not blaming devs. You cannot blame them for it.Yes, there is only 7 main missions without relevant story, but 49 faction missions, 50 challenges, 30 bridge limbing and another stuff that will do it. I said that there is no relevant story, because I really feel like it is not. This game is more about destruction of the Panau that those 7 story missions. If you like cruising around with jet, I recommend you to buy Black Aerial DLC for that certain jet, otherwise rest is garbage for me. Multiplayer element has been added recently, I just tried it briefly, but will put out standalone review on it sooner or later.To make it shorter than the game is, you will definitely not make any mistake buying this and certainly not spending week or more inside the game.Bonus Point: Country TransitionRating: 9/10 "

												★ ★ ★ ★Making trouble in Paradise.With the original Just Cause being nothing but a failed GTA clone, most would expecting that and nothing but on the sequel, right? Wrong. This game is the embodiment of chaos and fun.Let's just get this out of the way: the story mode is♥♥♥♥♥ It doesn't get to be the fun B-Movie it tries to be, it feels like a chore. The missions are tremendously repetitive with some of the worst voice acting in gaming. It amazes me how a game with such a crappy story can feel so great! Perhaps it's because it isn't stuck to the story, this is sandbox at it's best. Who cares about some random island going through dictatorship? You want to blow stuff up! Hook up a car to an airplane and drive it to the edge of earth's atmosphere!This is one of the best time sinks on Steam right now, just don't go expecting Shakespare.			"

												I've got to say I fell in love with this game from the very start. The storyline is gripping and addictive. I’ve never got board of this game since I got it and I’ve been loving it ever since. Even though it is not the newest game on the market, it is still one of the best. Just Cause 2 is up there in my Top 3 favourite games ever, yeah, it means that much to me! From stealing fighter jets to driving a fire engine, you can literally do anything. One of my favourite things to do is massive road trips across the map, I know, it might be a bit sad but I find it fun! It works so well because the map is that big. I only realised that the PC map is a lot bigger that the console map a couple of months ago! At least I think it is. In conclusion, it is amazing game and I recommend to everyone to buy it because it is one of the best games I have ever played. Period.			"

												Very good game, haven't thoght that it could make so much fun. A very big open world, you have every possibility you can think of doing stuff in the air, water and on the ground. If you try to 100% it, you need probably over 100 hours, and if you want every achievement, like me ;). Story, well who cares about that in this case :D			"

												In my opinion the best open world Shooter/RPG/whatever even after years of its release. The graphics can still compete with current generation games and the sound effect in different territories on the map are great. You can invest a lot of time in this game and still have fun after hours of playing it. 10/10Also the crazy civillain mod is great fun, but it can drive you mad			"

												Just Cause 2 brings much needed improvement upon the first game's format. Improving in almost every conceivable way, it turned a game which was riddled with problems and a repetitive nature into an enjoyable experience. It's far from perfect, story falling into the stupid and cliche once more, but at least somewhat satirical this time, if it was meant to be taken seriously then the voice acting certainly didn't help. Just Cause 2 can also crash on systems well above recommended requirements albeit rare. Besides those points, there's a lot to like. The soundtrack is better than ever and perfect for the game. Graphics are great and polished, assuming you can overlook the forced depth of field (developers please stop this.) The world is expansive yet detailed with various areas like mountain regions, cities and deserts to explore and complete. Quality of gameplay as a whole has improved drastically with better controls, intuitive combat including use of grapple, better side activates, missions and creative bosses. Avalanche studios put real effort in between JC1 and 2 and it shows. It's a much more enjoyable game, sure it can be repetitive going for 100%, but I still got a solid 18 hours out of the game without completing it fully. So I recommend picking it up for anyone interested in an open world sandbox all about causing chaos then go for it.			"

												Just from playing 2hrs of this game i can say it is enjoyable, the physics can be funny when shooting enemies and see them flying or when jumping out of a moving car only to see the enemy vechile crashing into it and exsploding. Although the keyboard controls can be diffuclt it is still fun to play. The grappling is fun but was annoying at first when shooting to get to places. What is annoying is running out of ammo like in seconds. WTF, kill 4 guys, oh gun runs out of ammo. Still this is the beginning and will ungrade in the future playthroughs. I find this game to be enoyable if you like blowing the ♥♥♥♥ out of things. 8/10			"

It has very fun gameplay where you get to drive and fly around in free-roam. The map is quite large with many places to go to. You get to cause destruction by exploding and destroying fuel tanks, radio control towers ETC. There are 3 different factions and you may choose which of the three you can work with: Reapers, Ular Boys & Roaches. This game is quite fun and I definitely reccomend it for what it is.			"

												Just Cause 2 pumps you into action the moment the game starts and barely is there time to catch your breath as you go from one area to the next, one plane to the other, one seaboat to another and one parachute to the other. With new enemies, weapons, and vehicles, the game gives you an array of items at your disposal... yeah, well, good or no?The guns are pretty weak as the realism doesn't set in in this game at all, which is expected considering that's just how the game is meant to be, which is pretty great at times. The game does get repetitive somewhat quickly after about a day's worth of gaming. Only 'specialty' areas are unique, though not in large numbers. Enemies remain the same, without much difference in them and aren't memorable. Same characters as in Just Cause but with, of course, Baby Panay and his men and a few others. Vehicles are nice, nothing special (probably intentional), and easter eggs are plenty, though a rather obvious one is one a lot of people know about whether they've played the game or not or have seen what the egg is referencing.So, yeah, weapons are meh-y, vehicles uneventful, enemies boring, and locations repetitive.But does that make it a bad game? NOPE. It's fun, yes, but as the review states here and there, it does get repetitive, but the non-stop action and hilarious ways to kill enemies makes the game quite addictive. Overall, gameplay to 100% completion takes about... well, maybe 80 hours if you play it casually but non-stop probably less. Is it worth doing new games on it? Maybe more-so after a long time of not playing just to be nostalgic.What this game offers over other games of similar style is... well, the style. Infinite parachutes, grappling hook for every occasion, and a kickass Rico makes the game all the more fun. So go ahead and get it, it's fun and addictive but you shouldn't be expecting to want to play it every waking moment after the first few hours.7.5/10			"

												Just Cause 2 is a 3rd person shooter that looks and feels a lot like GTA and Saints Row. It's main trademark is the grappling hook, that can be used to pull yourself to objects far away or pull objects towards you.Pros:+ Vast environment with distances that feel realistic. Driving 10 kilometers feels like driving 10 kilometers in real life. Downside of this is that the world feels a little empty and repetative at times.+ All the major weapon classes are represented and you can upgrade your gear.+ Pretty good story. + Memorable character build and rich dialogues.+ The local propaganda radio reflects on your latest actions, trying to cover everything up.+ Playing a villain was served in a satisfactory, humorous manner, that suited the whole story.Cons:- Missions start to feel repetative very quickly, falling roughly into 3 categories:	1. Go kill everyone and blow everything up in a particular place.	2. Help some gangsters get to a fortified camp and protect them until they take it over.	3. Destroy something/someone in a limited timeframe.- A few bugs like falling through a bridge or not being able to get out of a turned over car.VerdictIt's not amongst my favorite games, far from it. Travelling the distances was a pain and the repetative missions got tiresome quickly. On the other hand, unleashing havok has a quality of it's own and the game surely has a ton of content to keep your hands tied for some 20+ hours.			"

												1st...I cannot believe this game has been made in 2010-11, and why i never tried it since now...Welcome to Panau! One of the biggest south asian map, ever created for a game of this genre. You are Rico, i like to think he's a Saboteur, as you'll get contracts and missions of all kind to destabilized a whole system of corrupted government by undertaking tons of main and side missions.Guerillas, warfares, infiltration, extraction, black market weapons, vehicules, sabotage, and blowing up everything to gain alliances, or make new enemies will be your everyday life in Just Cause 2!Exploring this vast and huge world the way you want, gives this game a very deep immersion feeling.This is how you'll find new villages, cities and even military bases you'll have to control.To do so, you have a gazillion different horde of weapons, gadgets, and vehicules of all kinds.From sea gliders, to apache style helicopters, tanks and armored vehicules, you want it? you got it! How about modifiying your vehicules? you can! how about a flak gun on a Tuk Tuk? you can!How about controlling your own airport, having your very own private jet? YOU CAN!It's a 100% open sandbox world where you can do almost everything you want, the way you want, when you want.Think of it like if GTA would have been having babies with Battlefied.The vast majority of everything you'll see in this game is 100% destructible, so you can create havoc in villages, destabilize entire supplies of gas and water, expend your territories, you decide who you are working for, and keep what you've earned by helping guerillas groups, rebellions, or even the corrupted gorvernment itself in a ""Che Guevara"" mood-style storyline.The optimisation for most gaming rigs is also amazing, right now i'm running mostly everything on ultra, and on the benchmark, i get an amazing 120 FPS all the time. No matter what i do in game and the graphics are beautiful, and breathtaking, good job to Avalanche studios!This game has been made for players to enjoy themselves, and have fun!When you can jump from your helicopter, open your chute, casual fly to a nuclear plant, use C4, blow it up, then run away with one of their tank, fight your way through, then call your black market dealer on the spot, to order a boat to get away?....What more do you need?...This is honestly an amazing game in its genre!10 out of 10 for Just Cause 2!

												Average story, decent voice acting, repetitive and uninteresting missions and yet I can't not recommend this game.Why? Two words: Grappling hook.The fun in this game, primarily, comes from the grappling hook. The grappling hook allows you to quickly traverse terrain, hook on to a vehicle to then hijack it or even use it to tow a vehicle around. You can even jump from vehicle to vehicle and add parachutes to the combo so that you can either hook on to another vehicle or use the momentum from your grappling to parachute higher and further.The open world of this game is set in the fictional island paradise of Panau and a very large paradise at that. The graphics are quite impressive, particularly in the large mountainous areas or high above the world in an aircraft the view really is great. The range of vehicles is large from cars, motorcycles to various aircraft and boats; using these vehicles to explore the world and wreak havoc is incredibly satisfying.That brings me to my next point. The destruction. The explosions. The weaponry. Whether it be a handheld gun or one attached to a vehicle, you're going to be causing a lot of damage to Panau. Causing a lot of explosions is satisfying and (other than grappling hooks) is what this game is all about.I am yet to play the multiplayer mod that was recently released on Steam but multiplayer in a game such as this will only add to the fun and chaos.Just Cause 2 is a game that frequently goes on sale so it wont be hard to find it for a very reasonable price and it's a small fee for hours and hours of fun. Buy now and never regret it.			"

It is one of those games that you can just pop in for a few hours and kill some time and have fun - there is always another settlement to ""clear"" (meaning - collect all the collectibles and blow everything up), another race to win, another vehicle to drive. And it's beautiful. Panau is a place I could live - if it weren't for the crazy dictator or the equally crazy American agent trying to ""liberate"" your country.

												This game is great. It is one of the only games where I wanted to do the story instead of just roaming around, not that roaming around isent awesome in this game. A complaint I have is that there is not alot of weapons, just generic guns like sniper rifle and assault rifle.  There is plenty of vehicals in the game, also plenty of stuff to blow up and mess around with. Another problem is that the campain missions are all the same, but the side missions are all differenet and they help show you around the map. Overall this game is probably worth 10-14 dollars, but sometimes it goes on sale for 2.50.			"

There are lots of vehicles you can hijack, missions you can complete, weapons you can acquire and upgrade, and stuff you can blow up. Plus, there is a free mod you can download so that you can play with friends. Overall, I highly recommend this game.			"

												Just Cause 2 is all about running around and having fun with loads of toys and things that go boom. If you go into this game thinking you're going to get some seminal epic, you're in for a surprise. Just Cause 2 is a tongue-in-cheek look at espionage video games. This guerilla simulator lets players raise hell in an immense open-world practically any way they want, and the results are sure to bring a smile to your face.Wherever you go, you'll find all sorts of things and people to destroy. Whether spitting death by launching rockets from a helicopter or grapple hooking a hapless enemy to a moving vehicle, you'll want to get creative in the ways you dispatch your foes. As such, this game is filled with hilarious combat most action gamers will really enjoy. Unfortunately, it also comes with its fair share of unpolished bits that the abundant humor simply can't cover up completely.The first 15-30 minutes of Just Cause 2 is a clear example of how not to make a video game. The introduction is filled with lots of things that plague the title throughout. For starters, this is where you'll be introduced to the cliché characters and lowbrow plot; I don't think I've ever cared less about a game's story - something about 'The Agency' hunting down a dangerous American in a nationalistic tropical island rife with pretenders to the throne. Making matters worse, the poor narrative is exacerbated by the loathsome dialogue and painful delivery. Some may argue that the developers tried to make the game cheesy in these regards in order to accentuate the humoristic approach the gameplay takes, but I'm here to squash those claims - the story, characters, and voice acting utterly fail.Thankfully, the run-and-gun action is often exceptionally fun. There are lots of different weapons to use, and delivering death in cruel and unusual ways soon becomes second nature. Perhaps the biggest reason for the off-the-wall combat is the dual grapple hook in Just Cause 2. Imagine romping through 3-D environments with Bionic Commando-like abilities. Now imagine pulling off grapple swings, hitching to vehicles, and zipping to locations that are over a hundred yards away! Moreover, pulling enemies out from behind turrets and immediately riddling them with bullets will not only net you special kills, but is ever so satisfying.The dual grapple hook is also an excellent way to get around combat zones. Rather than simply running from place to place, you'll be better served by zipping from building to building like some kind of mutant monkey. You'll be able to get in and out of combat in a flash, and get yourself into advantageous positions simply by aiming for the building tops. Of course, the grapple hook is only one way to get around. You'll also have access to a parachute that can be engaged on the fly at almost any moment.As good and as game-changing as these gameplay workings are, combat is held back significantly by the poor shooting and cover mechanics. This game essentially does away with any of the technical shooting skills gamers have developed in FPS and TPS titles over the years in favor of a user-friendly, cinematic approach. As long as your gun is pointed in the vicinity of an enemy, you'll turn him into Swiss cheese. While this forgiving tact makes pulling off aerial kills and other stunts a breeze, it also dumbs down the encounters.Another of the game's foibles is the difficulty in getting around the expansive world. As good as zipping around the combat zones can be, getting from one point of an island to another is extremely slow. This is due to a number of factors. First, the vehicles are cumbersome. Driving, flying, and boating around the hilly, overgrown, and obstacle-laden land, seas, and skies of Panau is painful. Second, the world is so big, you'll sometimes go nearly 10 kilometers (6 miles) to get to your next objective. Even in a chopper, this can take upwards of five minutes - in a quad, car, or rickshaw/golf cart you're looking at 20 minutes, minimum!In an attempt to ameliorate this, you can call up a black market dealer and get extracted from your current position to your desired location. While they let you call upon this glorified shuttle service as much as you want (and for free), it only really works if you've already been to the location.Despite the inefficiencies inherent to negotiating a massive open-world, Panau is a great place to get your guerilla on. I liked the varied terrain : encompassing beaches, urban zones, factories, villages, refineries, fortresses, jungles, air strips, mountains, etc. Panau is essentially a warrior's playground. There are literally thousands of nooks and crannies to discover. By exploring the world in detail, you'll get access to weapon and vehicle parts as well as get nifty health boosts.In addition to upgrade chests, you'll also find cash stashes that can be used to purchase new equipment. Cold, hard cash isn't the only form of currency in the game, however; Chaos is every bit as valuable. By taking out government vehicles and emplacements (radio towers, gas tanks, satellite arrays, holding tanks, transformers, etc.) you'll be awarded with ever-increasing Chaos totals. The more Chaos you unleash on Panau, the more faction and agency missions as well as back market items become available.Whether you're playing the game on PC, Xbox 360, or PS3, you'll be treated to a beautiful, if somewhat unrealistic, time. The Southeast Asian archipelago of Panau isn't exactly as lived in or as sensible as I would have liked, but it is a great place to play, nonetheless. If there was one word I had to use to describe Just Cause 2, it would be 'ridiculous'. The game never takes itself seriously, which, for the most part, is a good thing. However, sometimes this lackadaisical approach extends into areas where it shouldn't, resulting in an often unpolished, even amateurish experience. Still, the game has fun in spades, so all who pick it up are likely to have a total blast!			"

												The isle of Panau offers much to the adventurer at heart. For you it offers a purity of form with regard to Just Cause 2's gameplay.The first thing you'll notice with Just Cause 2 is how flowy everything is. From stealing cars to grappling on airplanes, to stealing an airplane while jumping from another airplane. All this is at the heart of Just Cause 2, and it really illistrates itself as ""Why did I just do that? Just cause..."".Action, destruction, chaos are at the heart of this game. Almost to it's detrement since the story tries to portray you as a liberator when you play as almost a conquerer. Your objectives are to destroy vital infastructure and you regularly bathe the island in lethal radiation just to complete a mission. Indeed you're more of a bad guy than the antagonist is, but that's okay. Because you did it... just cause.			"

(Yes, I like them! :-D)- You can blow stuff up!- You want to blow stuff up!- Plenty of towns to blow stuff up!- Grappling is fun- Plenty of mods available- Huge open world map to explore- Easter eggs- Action packedPlaying this game can feel like a good action flick in the B category. Don't take this game too seriously and you'll have lots of fun. :-) Don't pass this one by, the price of this game is ridiculously low for what you get in return.			"

												Now that I've finally gotten around to finishing the main quest of this game, I feel I have enough information to write a review. It is a phenomenal game.While the story is nothing to write home about and the controls can feel a bit wonky at times, the gratification that comes from grappling a jeep to the road and causing it to flip into the air or decimating harbors and army bases with a minigun are simply unmatched among games I've played. This game's main ""gimmick"" is your grappling hook that spits in the face of physics and basic logic. This 1 inch cord has enough power to hold a car to a helicopter without breaking and defies the concept of momentum, letting you jump off a skyscraper and grapple onto the road below without being harmed. The game also features a respectable arsenal of upgradable weapons and vehicles to terrorize the island nation of Panau with.There are few negatives that I can come up with for this game, but there are some minor issues:When you fall from a tall place, you transition into ""falling mode"" and controls shift accordingly. The distance it takes to transition seems inconsistent and can result in cheap damage.The DLC seems a bit overdone. I'm not a huge fan of DLC in the first place, and I bought the full version that includes the DLC, but I didn't feel like it added much to the game.The game is actually incomplete. The developers accidentally left out a few of the collectables, making it impossible to 100% the game ingame, you can still get all the Steam achievements though. I'm honestly puzzled as to why the devs haven't fixed this issue, since it should be a really easy fix.Lastly, and this may not be a bad thing for some people, Panau is big. Too big. Allow me to elaborate, I have played this game for 131 hours and I'm only about 75% of the way done. The conquering of towns and military bases is a blast at first and retains its enjoyability well, but I don't see myself 100%ing the game any time soon.Despite these complaints, I've gotten 131 hours of solid enjoyment out of this title and will definitely be playing it more. If this game looks like fun to you and you won't be too bothered by its problems, then this is easily worth its asking price.			"

												The Just Cause franchise was the reason for my entrance into the gaming world. When I first bought my Xbox 360, I saw that Just Cause 2 came with it; I was intrigued. So, little AraChN1DZzz Unsp0K3N decided to get that, and boy, did he love it to death! He spent over 2 years completing that game on every difficutly. Once he was done, he thought, ""Wow, I should get JC1!""But we will talk about JC1 in another review,  thank you summer sale. The actual game Just Cause 2 was a follow-up from the initial development of the character ""Rico Rodriguez"" from Just Cause 1, voice acting by  Robin Atkin Downes .  In fact, the two games have very similar endings. Baby Panay is supposed to be portrayed as some grotesque man who would kill his own father just to get the ""Presidential"" role of Panau (This isn't a spoiler, you are told this during the opening scene of JC2).  The graphics/physics In JC2, the graphics are a really big letdown. The scenery of the game is heavily painted, but that may be because of the huge map size, but if you are to compare the graphics to Battlefield, you will see that JC2 didn't really try hard enough in terms of the Graphical side of the battle. Also, you see that the creators basically copied and pasted the ""spinny trees"" and even buildings just to make the game look big, which really shouldn't be an option. However, I must say that looking out into the distance at some opposite islands really calms the feeling of the game. The physics of JC2 always keep you on the edge of your seat. The unrealistic yet amusing stunt jump always adds the feeling to the game that you are, in fact, playing a destructive game rather than one where you ""look...out into the distance"" and enjoy the view, you can do that when you complete the game, [reach 100% completion, impossible, right?] The grapple hook in JC2 was majorly upgraded from the usless grapple gun given to you in JC1, which is what the game is all about, the evolution of the grapple hook, as we see in JC3,  with the infinite tethering and the wingsuit.  The AI Being a very experienced player, I know what it is like to have  ♥♥♥♥♥♥  AI in a game, especially in JC2. At times, the AI is completely messed up - if you were to drive on the road in Panau City, the civillian AI would run away screaming ""Hey, he got a gun!"", which really doesn't make sense. Also, when I decide to inspect a Wilforce Trekstar [Panau Police] I see the passenger soldier standing up, waving his damn hands in the air like his favourite song has come on, on the propaganda news channel! One more criticism is that the usage of the military plane was never really implemented. I get Level 6 Heats, but only UH-33 Chippewas come, rather than a SI-47 Lepoard, which would really spice things up.To summarise, I would say that this game has its ups and downs. To be honest though, the map size was waaay out of its time, but that is what you can expect from pure perfection, except the copying and pasting. But really, this game is magnificent and if you can look past the Graphical exterior, then I know that you will have fun with this game.			"

												Outstanding game with decent graphics (for its age) and a stunning open world.The story is acceptable for a game focused on free roam gameplay, but not bothering to complete it won't really affect the rest of the game.The side missions' objectives can get quite repetitive but because of the nature of Just Cause 2, you can complete these missions with whichever vehicle or weapon you want.The game isn't too taxing on most systems of the last 7/8 years, a more recent machine should be able to max out all graphic settings.Highly recommended if you're into open world shooters or if your system isn't capable of playing Just Cause 3.

												Шпионский клон GTA. Расказывающий о приключениях супер-агента ЦРУ Рико Родригеза, на огромном райском острове (около 1000 кв. км.). Перестрелки, погони, прыжки с парашютом, угон автомобилей и военной техники. Можно выполнить самые разные трюки, вплоть до захвата летящего вертолета. Мир в Just Cause 2 — просто огромен, достаточно густо усыпан разными деревеньками, городами, военными базами, а так же просто красивыми и интересными местами. Динамика игры напоминает чем-то стелс игру, очень хорошо сбалансированную с экшеном. Оценка: Отлично 9/10			"

												I have spent alot of hours on this game on the consoles, and just a few on this but they are growing. This is a special game. This is one of the only games which you are completely free in. You can suicide bomb, grapplehook cars to roads and, of course, blow stuff up. The multiplayer mod which comes with the game, Is also amazing. I am glad that the guys who made the mod, made it. There is a wide range of guns featuring from pistols to crazy rocket launchers. There is also a wide range of vehicles, featuring from motorbikes to military rocket-launching bullet-shooting helicopters. Although there isn't quite alot of replayability, You cannot tell anyone it isn't fun grappling on to helicopters and blowing s#*t up. You'd be lying. This game also features a pretty awesome black market system where you get your guns, vehicles and you can catch a ride on a helicopter there too.			"

												I remember playing this on a friends account multiple years ago. It was fun, we were blowing things up, hijacking vehicles, fighting the police / mafia - a truely good game.However, when i bought the game for myself years later, it just didn't live up to the memories anymore. The game turned out to be repetetive, with a boring storyline and little to no actual content - most of the game just relies on the player deciding to do things (blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up, mostly) instead of offering it to him. Beeing able to decide what to do is nice, but this feels like Skyrim without Quests. You can clear dungeons, but its no fun if you don't have to kill that pesky giant spider, since it didn't eat anyones brother. Graphics are nice, music is okay, the controls are adjustable - it's not bad. It's just... boring. Sadly.			"

												So I bought this game not really knowing what to expect. When it just came out, someone said it was awesome. And I gotta say, I am not dissapointed.The game lacks realism on certain parts of the game, for example the grappling and the infinite parachutes. It is those things that makes the game awesome. It is a bit hard to get used to in the beginning of the game, but once you are used to it, you are glad you have it.This game as a third person shooter is also a succes. Again, a bit difficult to get used to the dualwielding/single wielding hotkeys. The dual wielding is awesome in the middle of fights, because if you use it correctly, you don't run out of ammo most of the time. No game is perfect, neither is this game. The stronghold takeovers are pretty repetitive, there aren't many of them, but all of them are the same: same goals, same order of objectives. The only difference is the difficulty.The missions are mostly unique. I really enjoyed most of them. Some of them take a long time because it is a long mission or because some of them are kinda difficult. The shorter ones are usually pretty easy: Go there, do this and you are done. But there is a nice variety of missions.Overall, if you like third person shooters and or weird games, then I strongly recommend this game. I haven't play multiplayer yet, so I don't know how good that is.			"

												Are you looking for destructable enviorments, crazy physics, and a story that comes from a B-movie? This game is for you! Great gameplay overall, and a wide variety of ways you can kill and have fun with your enemies using your grappling hook, this game is a solid 8.5/10. I recommend anyone who loves stunts and insane battles to buy this game. After you've finished the agency missions it's also recommended to download Just Cause 2: Multiplayer Mod. Do not play the multiplayer before you've finished the original game or it will lose it's fun.			"

												Excellent sandbox game.  Huge world to mess around with.  Lots of stuff to do, though some of it gets a bit ""samey"".Solid controls (I prefer KB/mouse but gamepad works well too). You can easily switch between the two during play e.g. I usually opt for the gamepad when doing a racing mission.Grappling, parachuting, flying, driving - it all works well and is great fun.  Explosions!  Among my favourite moments was circling around an oil rig with a gunship blowing up all the fuel tanks.  So satisfying. :)Highly recommended.			"

												Probably the best open world game ever! The game is better than what the trailer looks like and if the discription gives you a serious thought for the game, it actually rediculusly hallarious. I have truley had more fun with this game than any of the Grand Theft Auto games and i deffinatly recomend this game to anyone as there is not any very violent scenes or anything that would put the game of anyhigher than PG-13. If you are deciding to buy this game or GTA5, I will 100% reccomend you this game its cheaper and if you are looking to have a hallarious and fun time, pick this game up NOW! Its only 15 bucks(instead of 60 for GTA5) and it goes on sale all the time from 9.99 to 2.99.			"

												Just Cause 2 is a fun game to mess around in.JC2 was meant to be cheesy, with one-liners and plenty of explosions. Explosions, cars, guns, more explosions, cars, and guns. There are alot of explosions in this game. Another thing which makes this game is a multiplayer mod avaliable on Steam, for free. If you ever get bored of regular JC2 you could always go there. JC2 also has a good modding community, with a good number of mods to choose from and play around with. The game is in Third Person, although there are First Person mods out there.In general, I would recommend JC2 to anyone who likes to have fun in their games and not take anything too seriously. And also to anyone who likes guns, cars, and/or explosions. Because there are alot of explosions.			"

												Chaos, chaos, and more chaos. This is what the game is about. With Rico Rodriguez you have the power to do awesome stuff that looks way to cool to be realistic (infinite parachutes). The game doesn't take it self seriously and that is why is so great, you know it isn't gonna be realistic or have a dark storyline. It all about the gameplay. I finished almost the entire videogame but not on steam, the main missions, the gangs mission. The only thing that I didnt complete were the collectibles, those pesky little items like drug drops or those funny skulls. Didn't care for those anybay. Still, all those hours were not wasted.With the inclussion of multiplayer, everything is on a whole different scale. Playing with friends while on voice chat is very fun, except when there are people on the servers that start to annoy us by killing us with a helicoopter.Worth it? Definitely			"

												Do you like GTA? Then you'll like this game as well! Just Cause 2 has less missions than several GTA games, sure, but it delivers way harder in personality and the actual content in the missions themselves, while providing excellent mechanics for an open world game, including more realistic explosions and realistic world response. Having the Panau military hunting you actually feels like you're wanted, and you can have epic car chases without having it feel weird and terribly unrealistic. Above all, it supports several ingame cheat codes, which imo is a must of open world singleplayer games, since when the content is overwith, you can screw around with your game. That's absolutely fantastic! There's also a multiplayer mode in which you can play online, but unfortunately not many plays it properly, and Panau is a huge, huge open world area, so it's not funny for the most part, I'm afraid. The game on it's own though, I can only recommend it!			"

												Just Cause 2 is a killer sandbox title with a great campaign - better than any Grand Theft Auto title for freedom, scale, graphics, and pure fun. The only issue is that after exploring the whole map (which is huge), new areas feel somewhat repetitive. Bad marks also for the publisher who is kinda dóuchey with the DLC. With a real modding community this game could have been huge. 9/10 for the best single-player sandbox game in my collection.			"

												Awesome game, everything just seems spot on. I do hope JC3 can live up to JC2. The DLC doesn't do much to enhance your adventure but the vehicles may be fun for you, the cheap helicopter certainly was a 'go to' for me for a while when funds were low. I don't recall any flaws or bugs but the game has been out for a few years! I'd say it's definately worth picking up If you like the 3rd person perspective game genre, the gameplay is fun, the graphics still look good and the recent-ish multi player mod should add even more value.I think I paid €5 for it in a sale, in retrospect i'd be happy paying €15 (I am hard to please though).....go get it !

												A beautiful sandbox game about overthrowing the Government of Panau on a quest to find out the true reason and purpose of why you were sent to assassinate the man who thought you everything you know (Being a badass wize)Gameplay:Your given all you’ll need (not as 1st but as you progress) to start enjoying yourself as you rip about Military establishments and resources in efforts to gain “Chaos points” that contribute to progressing the story (It’s to simulated how far you throw the Island in anarchy [but sadly the islands citizens are to poor/lazy to even show their world is going to hell no matter how far you progress)]Driving in this game feels great except for the few situations where you’re driving a vehicle on a terrain is shouldn’t be driving on but don’t worry, the game gives you a set of “Agency Vehicles” that should be able to hand the rough island of Panau better than the citizens “budget cars”Flying is a little less great compare to driving mostly due to the lack of speed control and your plane relationship to water. Helicopters on the other hand is almost the polar opposite of the problem, since you their control way of taking off and landing and having the ability to take your time dealing damage with them instead of worrying of crashing when swopping. Ground controls may be tedious at times (when dealing with climbing mountains) but the grappling hook ability combined with the parachute makes it fairly easy to get where you want after taking some times to keen your skills on the controlsVisuals: In my opinion even in today time, this game is one of the best looking games on PC. The world is set on a tropically island and during the day you get the full range of vivid colors of the jungle of Panau while during the night you get a overtone of blue with the specs of light in the world shinning over the water. There also rain weather that happens randomly throughout the game but I’m not sure if there is a “Blizzard” variant. The games looks its best at the twilight and dawn hours of the day where you can see the sunset in all its glory attempting to reach over the horizon as it slowly descents into night .Story: The mainstory line is ok (nothing to special about it) but the Factions missions are pretty much a ongoing joke compare to it. Mostly the missions are used to make you participate in events full of all the crazy♥♥♥♥♥shit the devs thought of for you. Sometimes the mission isn’t that interesting along the faction timeline but there are a few jems that makes it worth it to play through all the factions missions regardless of how you feel about the morality of each of them.DLC: Some of the DLC in the game is truly unnecessary, I’m just going to give you a list of what not to get and you can determine wheatear or you want the restDO NOT GET: Bull Eye’s Sniper (Less damage Sniper riffle with the return of faster firing and more ammo, it takes 2 heashots to kill the Commando type enemies)Rico Signature gun (Pretty much a fully upgrade revolver fun at 1st, useless latter when you realized what I did)Maybe: Black market Boom pack (Never found myself to have much used for these weapons ingame but if you’re planning for online multiplayer I think these weapons will serve you much better there)What made me loss my motive to complete the game to 75% (for achivement purposes) is not the time I had on me in this moment of time, its that I just lost intrest after I finish all the faction missions + Agency missions were complete and the game turn into bassically into a Find n' seek blow them up. I might go back to finish it tho one day...			"

												Just Cause 2, from what I've played, is one of the best takes on the one-vs-many concept - put an entire island country in front of a near demigod of a man, and put the results into code. In essence, it is an action movie turned into a game, and in the best way I've seen in my years. Irreprievably overpowered gadgets, an open world large enough to keep you constantly on the run, driving vehicles, flying vehicles, standing on top of vehicles, standing on top of flying vehicles, and a goal at hand: to free the oppressed people of a small, fictional island from the tyranny of their dictator.Thinking about buying this game? Keep this in mind: You will never feel much satisfaction quite like leaping from an exploding building into a full-on skydive.Good luck, soldier.			"

												So I bought this game not really knowing what to expect. When it just came out, someone said it was awesome. And I gotta say, I am not dissapointed.The game lacks realism on certain parts of the game, for example the grappling and the infinite parachutes. It is those things that makes the game awesome. It is a bit hard to get used to in the beginning of the game, but once you are used to it, you are glad you have it.This game as a third person shooter is also a succes. Again, a bit difficult to get used to the dualwielding/single wielding hotkeys. The dual wielding is awesome in the middle of fights, because if you use it correctly, you don't run out of ammo most of the time. No game is perfect, neither is this game. The stronghold takeovers are pretty repetitive, there aren't many of them, but all of them are the same: same goals, same order of objectives. The only difference is the difficulty.The missions are mostly unique. I really enjoyed most of them. Some of them take a long time because it is a long mission or because some of them are kinda difficult. The shorter ones are usually pretty easy: Go there, do this and you are done. But there is a nice variety of missions.Overall, if you like third person shooters and or weird games, then I strongly recommend this game. I haven't play multiplayer yet, so I don't know how good that is.			"

												Buy this game and play it.  That's pretty well all that needs to be said but I'll say a bit more.The grappling hook in this game may be one of the single best/fun mechanics I've ever played with in a game.  Hooking vehicles, boats, planes and more together is just plain fun.  Using it while also shooting down some rag tag militia might be even more fun.  You get a fair share of vehicles and weapons to wreck mayhem everywhere.  There's also a lot of missions and story that keep you interested in causing more mayhem.  As well you get a gigantic island with lots of variety to the terrian and good deal of towns/cities to play in and cause further mayhem.With all that mayhem you cause you may generate a fair amount of attention from the local authorities, but thats okay, cause using your grappling hook to get out of those situations is just as fun as when you used your grappling hook to get into the situation.Get this game and enjoy the hell out of it like everyone else has.

												Amazing Game!!! Great Graphics! Every Prop Is Real and the sandbox physics make this game amazing to play. A great game for people who like gmod and css, action games, and adventures, as this game really has its own story, so that you can play with a goal in mind through hard and easy!			"

												I love this game even though its fairly old its still a classic, the just cause franchise is a must experience and i reccomend it to anyone who has a fairly mild gaming pc. Also the modding comunity has done alot of good work and just cause 2 multiplayer is a brilliant addon for the game.			"

												Excellent sandbox game.  Huge world to mess around with.  Lots of stuff to do, though some of it gets a bit ""samey"".Solid controls (I prefer KB/mouse but gamepad works well too). You can easily switch between the two during play e.g. I usually opt for the gamepad when doing a racing mission.Grappling, parachuting, flying, driving - it all works well and is great fun.  Explosions!  Among my favourite moments was circling around an oil rig with a gunship blowing up all the fuel tanks.  So satisfying. :)Highly recommended.			"

												So I bought this game not really knowing what to expect. When it just came out, someone said it was awesome. And I gotta say, I am not dissapointed.The game lacks realism on certain parts of the game, for example the grappling and the infinite parachutes. It is those things that makes the game awesome. It is a bit hard to get used to in the beginning of the game, but once you are used to it, you are glad you have it.This game as a third person shooter is also a succes. Again, a bit difficult to get used to the dualwielding/single wielding hotkeys. The dual wielding is awesome in the middle of fights, because if you use it correctly, you don't run out of ammo most of the time. No game is perfect, neither is this game. The stronghold takeovers are pretty repetitive, there aren't many of them, but all of them are the same: same goals, same order of objectives. The only difference is the difficulty.The missions are mostly unique. I really enjoyed most of them. Some of them take a long time because it is a long mission or because some of them are kinda difficult. The shorter ones are usually pretty easy: Go there, do this and you are done. But there is a nice variety of missions.Overall, if you like third person shooters and or weird games, then I strongly recommend this game. I haven't play multiplayer yet, so I don't know how good that is.			"

												Chaos, chaos, and more chaos. This is what the game is about. With Rico Rodriguez you have the power to do awesome stuff that looks way to cool to be realistic (infinite parachutes). The game doesn't take it self seriously and that is why is so great, you know it isn't gonna be realistic or have a dark storyline. It all about the gameplay. I finished almost the entire videogame but not on steam, the main missions, the gangs mission. The only thing that I didnt complete were the collectibles, those pesky little items like drug drops or those funny skulls. Didn't care for those anybay. Still, all those hours were not wasted.With the inclussion of multiplayer, everything is on a whole different scale. Playing with friends while on voice chat is very fun, except when there are people on the servers that start to annoy us by killing us with a helicoopter.Worth it? Definitely			"

												Do you like GTA? Then you'll like this game as well! Just Cause 2 has less missions than several GTA games, sure, but it delivers way harder in personality and the actual content in the missions themselves, while providing excellent mechanics for an open world game, including more realistic explosions and realistic world response. Having the Panau military hunting you actually feels like you're wanted, and you can have epic car chases without having it feel weird and terribly unrealistic. Above all, it supports several ingame cheat codes, which imo is a must of open world singleplayer games, since when the content is overwith, you can screw around with your game. That's absolutely fantastic! There's also a multiplayer mode in which you can play online, but unfortunately not many plays it properly, and Panau is a huge, huge open world area, so it's not funny for the most part, I'm afraid. The game on it's own though, I can only recommend it!			"

												Multiplayer is fun, you should experience it... If you havent been following the development of jc2 mp, it can house up to 9000 players on a single server.. granted the hardware and bandwidth is there.I have been playing on a single server with around 1000 active players at once. Interaction with other players with a 1000 connected has some noticable lag, but not horrible. I should also note that the server I was on is located in the UK, while im based in the US, distance is one of the biggest factors determining lag.its a ton of fun.Although there are no real objectives in mp, you can figure out how to have a blast in very little time.The mod also features Race and Demolition Derby modes that you can hop into at anytime. Race is a lot of fun, you will find yourself racing dogged old busses, or super fast performance cars, 4 wheeler atvs, even base jump racing !Go to one of the local attractions like /tp airport ... and watch the utter chaos as a few hundred people spawn vehicles and weapons and have an all out free for all.I should note that the Multiplayer mod is still in beta, so there are occasional crashes, but nothing to get squeemish about, the game itself is really well optimized for PC, and holds up well... until you start doing crazy physics stuff like flying a boat thats spinning at 100rpm :D ( Yep I said Flying a boat ! )Its madness, its halarious, its goofy, and its fun.Single player is sandbox action and comedy wrapped into a nice package.Not as in depth storyline as GTA4, basically go here destroy that, go there rescue him type of idiom.

												lots of fun with just being able to mess around in singleplayer. Multiplayer isnt so good because of the lack of any NPC's and stuff, but other than that, really enjoyable game!EDIT:so its been AGES since i wrote that review...as in like, 2 or 3 YEARS...so i figured i'd update it. So, without further ado, i present to you pros and cons of the game...although i dont know how many people will read it, with jc3 out.so:Pro's-EXPLOSIONS...EXPLOSIONS EVERYWHERE!!!-you can grapple everywhere you go, and its more often than not used as a main form of transport-mod support (although at first a little difficult to install mods-and you have to go to specific websites to get decent mods-i do believe mod.db might have one or two, but http://justcause2mods.com/ is the most useful.)-Doesnt require an amazing computer to run-runs quite well on my  low end laptop as long as graphics are kept low-side missions thatl keep you busy for a while-average campaign...short, but not the worst ive seen.-plenty of funny moments-jets....just...jets....Con's-Fire one shot at any range with any gun and every single enemy on the map is alerted-basically, if you want to take over a base quietly, bring a rocket launcher...enough said.-the 'cover' image for the game lies, you never get attacked by jets...although the helicopters are sorta common-game feels overall half finished, as though the devs released it slightly too early from development. Its really rather complicated to explain.-the occasional mild bug or glitch, but nothing a AAA title doesnt have on average these days-only about 3 different enemy types-regular soldiers armed with small arms, (pistols, smgs, a few sawn-off shotguns) 'elites' which are armed with assault rifles, lmg's, and shotguns, and colonels (hope i spelled that right XD) which are entirely bulletproff except for their heads...because reasons...-paid dlc...(overpriced for some items might i add...)-I decided to write this at 2am...not related to the review at all, but just thought i'd mention it XDWell, congrats, you made it to the end of the review...you can stop reading now....no seriously stop....STAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHPPPP...fine.....i give up....you can just sit there....reading this for no reason...because im done....completely....WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!?!?!?ok done, thanks for reading, hope you enjoyed wasting those....20 seconds of your life....k bye			"

												A game that almost allows you to do whatever you want. It's got outlandish action sequences that you fully control, nothing scripted. You drive/hijack anything that moves and anything you see you can go there. The graphics are amazing for such a large seemless world. The story isn't the best at all, neither are the missions, but this sets a new precedence for sandbox games. The only downfall to this game is that the control of vehicles and planes aren't too great without a controller, but the rest is spot on.  I haven't had this much fun in a game without following the actual storyline or missions in a long time.Edit: The controls for the vehicles at least on the keyboard seem to have been resolved.  The controls are much smoother and you can easily control your vehicles/boats/planes/etc...			"

												The Just Cause 2 story is that of one in a porno. It is necessary to have a story, but it doesn't mean it is a good one. Quite frankly this is one of the worst stories I have ever had the enjoyment of playing. BUT story doesn't mean♥♥♥♥♥♥in this game and you can tell. This game is about doing whatever you want because JUST CAUSE. Wanna strap a vehicle to a Passenger plane and watch physics break down? Do you want to give the middle finger to physics and logic? Do you wish to play a sandbox with a little more? Well I sure as hell do. My word is this game something special. Without the Grapple Hook this game would be nothing special. But hey you have a Grapple Hook which kicks the Hook Shot's♥♥♥♥♥ With this ungodly tool you become the most versatile being in the game. Think of this like Spiderman, but you don't cry like a little ♥♥♥♥♥. You can cling to walls and shoot ""webs"" and swing around not giving a single ♥♥♥♥. On a more serious note I love driving around the map taking in the magnificence of Panau Island and it is easily one of the more rewarding factors in the game. You'll discover over 350+ locations in which you can watch burn as you cause untolds amount of choas and havoc. Something else worth metioning is the mods. The mods are easy to work and are all hilarious. Some make you a god other add to the games graphics. Needless to say without mods the game is still fine on its own. Mods only exist to ""spice"" things up in the Just Cause Universe. Oh yeah there's multiplayer. I would wait on the Multiplayer until you have played around in Singleplayer. Multiplayer is Singleplayer but with way more players (No♥♥♥♥♥♥:\). In conclusion this game is the near perfection of large scale sandbox with plenty of hilarious moments and some seriously addicting gmaeplay. Remember each timke you play will never ever be like your last session.			"

												Lovely game with a country sized map - lots of free space to roam arround & the multiplayer mod is just way fun. I totally recommend checking this out & giving this game a try - If you love Third Person Shooters with epic explosions & demolition tactics - then this is defenetly your piece of cake. An epic champage wich you can play in many different ways - tons of vehicles from small bikes to tanks, jets. Lots of weapons wich you can upgrade for more ammo & damage & a very neat Black Market system - perfect DLC involed at a fair price.			"

												There are HOURS of fun to be had in this game. I dare you to 100% it. The extensive open world map has impressivly fluid graphics. It consists of smaller areas such as military bases, large airports, cities, and small villages that can be 100% completed if you collect all boxes scattered within and destroy obviously marked structures (water towers, fuel towers, power stations, gas lines, etc.) though this attracts attention. This progress leaves you with upgrades and cash that can be spent on helocopter drops including weapons and vehicles. Once a place is descovered you can fast travel to it from your map.Of coures there is an arsenal of fun weapons (that can be expanded with DLC) though an FPS this is NOT. The weapons combat has a more arcade feel and there is apparently no such thing as stealth. Tuck yourself away with a sniper rifle to pick off the bad guys and you'll find one shot and everyones guns are instantly fireing at you. There's also no real reward for killing them. In the end you will find yourself almost always having to evade their infinte numbers and waiting for the cooldown before walking back in front of them like a different guy on the island in the same outfit as the guy just shooting them.The grapple and parachute make traversing the map extremely fun and easy. The grapple also serves a melee attack and can string together two objects including vehicles, humans, and unmovable serfaces. aah, good times. As mentioned in another review this would have been amazing to see in Farcry 3. As far as the story it's more or less just there to move you around the island for yet another mission and to unlock challanges. The story doesn't do much to deepen your experients with the game so don't expect The Last of Us story line action movie style. The misions and challenges are still fun and do well for breaking things up with different types of action. I don't want too sound too negative in my review but i won't gush over it either like another greatest game ever. However, I would highly recomend this game to any PC gamer (especially if you can get a deal) if only for the kicks and giggles. If it was missing something before it was multiplayer. But as of the date of this review the multiplayer mod DLC was released on Steam. Happy Gaming.			"

												That game holds old games' soul inside!Gameplay is really fun, open-world implementation and details are awesome, graphics are also impressive. Generally i don't like purposeless games like this but even JC2's story and faction missions seems same and simple; they are also fun. Shooting government soldiers, blasting their bases and searching for hidden upgrade boxes are fun somehow. Also all places has their unique allocation.Vehicles mechanics are also really great, you can feel which one is van or racing car or you can feel differences between planes and helicopters.If you're not after realism, buy it. You'll probably like to play Just Cause 2.			"

												This isn't a game; this is more of an ""interesting out-of-context things generator"" in the sense that Just Cause 2 is pretty much a wreck-it-up where you play as secret agent and gravity fugitive Rico Rodriguez who has to do things on the island of Panau. What, exactly, do you do on Panau?Destroy stuff.That's literally the goal of the game; you destroy stuff and it advances the plot. The game gives quite a few creative ways to do it; you can take a motorbike, drive fast, and parachute off of it as it goes flying into a gas station, causing everything to explode as the cops are suddenly after you. The cops seem rather intelligent... somewhat. Gameplay's pretty solid, and in general the entire game feels like an open-world action movie. Panau is colossal and has a ton of things to do and destroy. This game does have a few bugs and glitches, however, but it doesn't take too much away from the game.			"

One problem i have with this game is the police are very easy to kill and shake off which can be anoying although it's nothing a bit of modding cant fix. There is also a multiplayer mod which is pretty fun it's avalable here on steam so i would recommend that. Overall just cause 2 is a great game worth its price and i would recommend it to anyone who likes a good action game. I give it a solid 8/10.			"

												In this action packed game, you are in an agency to find Baby Panay. He is the president of the island, Panau, on which you play on. Do mini quests for people and build up heat by destroying Panau army supplies and whatnot. Even gas stations! Download mods at justcause2modding.com and play to your hearts content with that new tank you've been wanting! After you complete the game, you go into mercenary mode which you can go freestyle and have fun. Plus, the percentages in mercenary mode tell you how complete you are from pretty much doing everything. Use your grappling hook, parachute, shotgun, or even rocketlauncher, to earn chaos. This is the game (from what I've heard that it's much like Grand Theft Auto) that you would not want to miss out on the sales for!			"

Good Gameplay and stuff, pretty much liked it, the World is too much Big compared to any GTA, because GTA worlds are made manually, while in this Game, most of the places are copy pasted. Grappel is more fun, pulling back enemies, hijacking cars and Aero Planes, going from places to places. Beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of Enemies with that. Weapons are Fun too.

It's a little repetitive, but the combat is fun, the grappling hook has so many uses, and the vehicles are interesting and unique from one another.

												This game is amazing! The graphics are beautiful (Nvidia themselves actually helped with the graphics for this game) and the gameplay is amazingly fun. If you enjoy playing open-world action-adventures (like Red Dead Redemption or Borderlands) this is a game for you! Not to mention, the Multiplayer Mod just came out...			"

												Action packed game that is advanced by causing damage to others, CHAOS! Very good game although it is very easy to get dragged away from the main story line and end up causing destruction to towns, families and terrorist gangs. Played over 20 hours within a weekend as the game is addictive, fun and intense! If you enjoy a game that doesn't have a strong story line but instead in jam packed with fun then I would definitely recommend!			"

												There is nothing more to say about this game as it’s pretty much like a Dolph Lundgren or Michael Dudikoff action movie. One man against the world. In this particular case, against a dictator on a little oil-rich fictional island and different groups of interest who wanna stage a coup and take over. Of course a communist fraction is not missing ;-) This game is all about action, action and action. Don’t expect a deep meaningful story, its pretty much like this kind of movies. I don’t wanna spoil so some missions feel like being on top of a rushing train and killing a hundred of enemies. Even though the lack of a profound story, Just Cause 2 is quite entertaining in my opinion. The graphic looks good, different flora and fauna on the island plus you can destroy a lot of things. Also the achievement system is reasonable. The only negative aspects about the game are recurring missions alongside the main story, no animals and that the citizens are doing nothing at all. Anyway I had my fun. Especially after work where I had no intention to use my brain rather than just play and kick♥♥♥♥♥ My rate: 7/10.			"

It's a free-roam with many places to go, many places to be, and many people to meet. It's in third person, and you are a man named Rico. This game also comes with a Multiplayer Mod which you can play with your friends and by just a touch of the 'B' key you can get stuff from the Black Market.

												A sandbox crime game, of sorts where it was made to mess around in. 2 1-handed firearms (dual wielded, discourage the same weapons), 1 2-handed firearm, grenades and explosive, a grappling hook which is used as a melee weapon and infinite parachutes in a massive open world.The story, dialog & characters are so bad it seems like a satire; still you want to barf at some dialogs though.No skyboxes per say: what you see, you can go to. Travel times are long, so have a podcast ready. But I still recommend it for the utter madness you can do in it. "

												Just Cause 2 is an open - world game. There are 3 factions, which gives you different missions and dialogue. The 3 factions are: The Reapers, The Ular Boys, and The Roaches. You also have your main missions, which lead you to the ending (if it wasn't self - explanitory). But that isn't what makes the game super fun. You have a huge country to explore: Panau. After quite awhile, you unlock a bunch of badass equipment, vehicles, and even have an extraction helicopter that can bring you to places you already discovered. You can fly a plane from one corner of the world, to the opposite end of the world. There are boats, helicopters, ATV's, motorcycles, etc. And, how could I forget, the grappling hook. The grappling hook is used to do all kinds of things. When you skydive, if you plan your grappling hook properly, you can break your fall! You can latch on the enemies and pull them to you! Anyways, that's all I can explain. But this game's a blast. You should buy it; full price or not! JUST BUY IT! Final Verdict: 9.5/10.			"

												This is just one very great game. The controls are fluent and feel really nice. The missions are a bit repetitive apart from the story missions, which make up less than 20% of the game. You have to complete minor missions before you can progress in the story line. However, you only need a handful of minor missions to unlock all the story missions. That's the one major flaw in this game, it doesn't push you to do a lot of minor missions, you can rush through the story line is less than 15 hours. After that, there is a HUGE amount of sidemissions and collectibles to keep you busy. Not as much fun as the story but still well worth your time. The graphics are very nice, especially considering this game is a couple of years old already. Goes around on steam for less than 10 bucks, this one is a no-brainer for anyone loving shooting, action and an open world to explore.			"

												This game is really cool. The graphics are nice, the story is okay, and being able to blow so much stuff up is bad♥♥♥♥♥ I only have one problem with the game and that is the out of sync audio in cut scenes. If anyone has a fix then I would love to hear it. Even without one though, I definitely recomend this game.			"

												Just Cause 2 is a unique game which implements many features that no other game - at the time of release or now - has ever implemented. Somewhat enjoyable, gameplay offers an extensive amount of amusement, when you get the hang of it that is. Jumping around with your grappling hook and parachuting from tree to tree to avoid gunfire is just one of the many aspects of this game that makes it notable. Storyline is thin and will be finished quite promptly and unfortunately, once you've gotten to that point, it just loses its fun-valueThe repetitiveness of the missions, atrocious voice acting, and overall lack of effort that seems to have been put into just about everything except fun game mechanics can leave a stale taste in one’s mouth. Flying around causing aimless chaos is fun for a few hours, but when you realize that's the only entertaining element the game has to offer you get bored quickly. "

												It has an infinitely usable zipline.Other than that, it's an action movie in game form. Filled with gunfights and explosions, you play as an American secret agent/black ops who goes and tears up a Southeast Asian dictatorship.This comes in the form of an open-world(the map is huge) 3rd person shooter with: campaign missions; mini-missions done for revolutionary groups and mafias with simple escort, collect, hijack, destroy, and kill objects; races; military bases and cities with infastructure to destroy, leaders to kill, and upgrades to collect; sprinkled around the map.Combat isn't too challenging, as you soak up any damage you can get. You can either: zip, roll, and jump around, whacking people, throwing around with your zipline, and shooting people; or do it the boring way.You also got your cars, your boats, your helicopters, your planes, and your military veichles to use in it too.You can also just raise some havoc, as in most open world games.Voice acting is pretty bad, and the very large map isn't too exciting to explore.

												Very fun game. If you dont want to be pushed into a story line, but want plot and action, along with guns, cars, planes, boats etc, this is your game.Think GTA5. Three potential storylines (all playable simultaneously), can buy weapons and vehicles, lots of destruction, and cop chases. The map is MASSIVE, i flew for 5 real time minutes, and i had barely crossed a quarter of the map. The game is truly Open World, where you can assualt military bases and complete sections of the map at your own speed. Weaknesses? Yeah, there are a few. AI is limited. Grappling hook has unrealistic reach, and some physics that are questionable.Overall, a great game that doesnt take itself seriously, but presents a good, time consuming, action-filled third person shooter. Can attach people to Oxygen tanks and shoot the tanks into the air. 10/10			"

												This isn't a game; this is more of an ""interesting out-of-context things generator"" in the sense that Just Cause 2 is pretty much a wreck-it-up where you play as secret agent and gravity fugitive Rico Rodriguez who has to do things on the island of Panau. What, exactly, do you do on Panau?Destroy stuff.That's literally the goal of the game; you destroy stuff and it advances the plot. The game gives quite a few creative ways to do it; you can take a motorbike, drive fast, and parachute off of it as it goes flying into a gas station, causing everything to explode as the cops are suddenly after you. The cops seem rather intelligent... somewhat. Gameplay's pretty solid, and in general the entire game feels like an open-world action movie. Panau is colossal and has a ton of things to do and destroy. This game does have a few bugs and glitches, however, but it doesn't take too much away from the game.			"

												While certainly not realistic or compellingly written, Just Cause 2 is unbelievably fun. All the mayhem and absurdity you'd expect from the good old days of Grand Theft Auto, with a huge map, tons of vehicles and lots of stuff to blow up, As I said, it's not realistic and its writing doesn't give Shakespeare a run for his money, but if you have a few bucks and want something fun to play for about 20 hours or so(a lot more if you go for higher completion), you can't go wrong with Just Cause 2.

												It has an infinitely usable zipline.Other than that, it's an action movie in game form. Filled with gunfights and explosions, you play as an American secret agent/black ops who goes and tears up a Southeast Asian dictatorship.This comes in the form of an open-world(the map is huge) 3rd person shooter with: campaign missions; mini-missions done for revolutionary groups and mafias with simple escort, collect, hijack, destroy, and kill objects; races; military bases and cities with infastructure to destroy, leaders to kill, and upgrades to collect; sprinkled around the map.Combat isn't too challenging, as you soak up any damage you can get. You can either: zip, roll, and jump around, whacking people, throwing around with your zipline, and shooting people; or do it the boring way.You also got your cars, your boats, your helicopters, your planes, and your military veichles to use in it too.You can also just raise some havoc, as in most open world games.Voice acting is pretty bad, and the very large map isn't too exciting to explore.

												Very fun game. If you dont want to be pushed into a story line, but want plot and action, along with guns, cars, planes, boats etc, this is your game.Think GTA5. Three potential storylines (all playable simultaneously), can buy weapons and vehicles, lots of destruction, and cop chases. The map is MASSIVE, i flew for 5 real time minutes, and i had barely crossed a quarter of the map. The game is truly Open World, where you can assualt military bases and complete sections of the map at your own speed. Weaknesses? Yeah, there are a few. AI is limited. Grappling hook has unrealistic reach, and some physics that are questionable.Overall, a great game that doesnt take itself seriously, but presents a good, time consuming, action-filled third person shooter. Can attach people to Oxygen tanks and shoot the tanks into the air. 10/10			"

												A very fun game, one of my favourite games i have. It has a massive open world with cities, jungles and beachs it even has a desert. you have a grappling hook and a parachute so you can easily get around the world, or if you want just steal a car, boat or plane. One problem i have with this game is the police are very easy to kill and shake off which can be anoying although it's nothing a bit of modding cant fix. There is also a multiplayer mod which is pretty fun it's avalable here on steam so i would recommend that. Overall just cause 2 is a great game worth its price and i would recommend it to anyone who likes a good action game. I give it a solid 8/10.			"

												This isn't a game; this is more of an ""interesting out-of-context things generator"" in the sense that Just Cause 2 is pretty much a wreck-it-up where you play as secret agent and gravity fugitive Rico Rodriguez who has to do things on the island of Panau.

												This game has one of my biggest passion ""Tropical Islands"". All those years I wanted a PC that works this game properly and finally got it. While flying with sunrise over these islands, always made me think a song called ""This Bitter Earth"" by ""Dinah Washington"". While song plays, I want to fly more and more, until the end of the world. Just seeing the ocean was even enough to make me happy. I cant describe my feelings for this game, but maybe I just can make you think about your life that you spend years on those dump cities. World still has wonders. just go outside and see it. And i believe, someday ill be the one who lies on the beach of that island. And I know, I'm not the only one.			"

												The Just Cause 2 story is that of one in a porno. It is necessary to have a story, but it doesn't mean it is a good one. Quite frankly this is one of the worst stories I have ever had the enjoyment of playing. BUT story doesn't mean♥♥♥♥♥♥in this game and you can tell. This game is about doing whatever you want because JUST CAUSE. Wanna strap a vehicle to a Passenger plane and watch physics break down? Do you want to give the middle finger to physics and logic? Do you wish to play a sandbox with a little more? Well I sure as hell do. My word is this game something special. Without the Grapple Hook this game would be nothing special. But hey you have a Grapple Hook which kicks the Hook Shot's♥♥♥♥♥ With this ungodly tool you become the most versatile being in the game. Think of this like Spiderman, but you don't cry like a little ♥♥♥♥♥. You can cling to walls and shoot ""webs"" and swing around not giving a single ♥♥♥♥. On a more serious note I love driving around the map taking in the magnificence of Panau Island and it is easily one of the more rewarding factors in the game. You'll discover over 350+ locations in which you can watch burn as you cause untolds amount of choas and havoc. Something else worth metioning is the mods. The mods are easy to work and are all hilarious. Some make you a god other add to the games graphics. Needless to say without mods the game is still fine on its own. Mods only exist to ""spice"" things up in the Just Cause Universe. Oh yeah there's multiplayer. I would wait on the Multiplayer until you have played around in Singleplayer. Multiplayer is Singleplayer but with way more players (No♥♥♥♥♥♥:\). In conclusion this game is the near perfection of large scale sandbox with plenty of hilarious moments and some seriously addicting gmaeplay. Remember each timke you play will never ever be like your last session.			"

												Just Cause 2 is that special kind of game that comes around once and a while. You see it for sale, think ""this looks quite silly, might give it 10 minutes."" 3 years later you are still rolling around laughing when you drive a motorbike into a helicopter and grapple onto another one. Full of all the insane action hero madness you will ever need, but instead of watching steven segal doing the action, you get to! with a multitude of vehicles and weapons to go and terrorise the government of panau island. And when i say island, I mean a full island. Massive and varied landscapes ranging from snowy mountains to cities to airports. If insane action hero madness gets a bit repetative with the same weapons and vehicles, Just Cause 2 has you covered with DLC! From Monster trucks for ploughing down streets to a giant gun that shoots out air, DLC is varied and gives more hours of fun. ""But Official_joeliecus, I only enjoy games where I can meet a stranger and blow his face off with a shotgun"" you say to me through a screen... somehow... Well, someone else has got you covered with that. Just Cause 2 Multiplayer Mod! Take those years of gameplay and spend more years of gameplay with someone else of whom has given years of their life to fun. Go and have a cargo plane race. Go and crash cars into each other, Twisted metal style. Go and ramp off of your friends boat in a boat, jump out and shoot him in the testicles, or overies (not sexist). This is the game you want to go to when you tell your friend ""wouldn't it be cool if they made a game where..."" and this game probably has it. Except dating simulation. It doesn't have that. To make a long review short, Just Cause 2 is one of my most recommended games, ever, and i've played skyrim... It is worth every milli-penny. Trust me.			"

												When picking up this game, I didn't expect to sink so many hours into it. Essentially, the game is a summer blockbuster movie with more explosions than a Micheal Bay film after he drank a nitroglycerin cocktail with a dash of oil for flavour. Although the story, dialogue and voice acting are entirely terrible, I feel that this is a deliberate move by the developers in order to create the impression that it is your everyday blockbuster action movie with atrocious story in video game form. However, I think you could probably tell that part from the fact you sent a 4 by 4 truck covered in C4 explosives hurtling into a military base that seems to have a particular need for massive tankers filled with petrol in highly exposed and vulnerable areas and leap out, materializing yet another one of Rico Rodriguez's seemly endless parachutes from what appears to be the aether, and glide over as tanks of petrol, oil pipelines, telecommunication dishs, radars and towers made from corrugated iron all explode in a massive fireball about as bright as the sun whilst you pick off any remaining survivors with a gatling gun that you ripped off a turret point, as well as annihilate an attack helicopter piloted by a particularly angry government soldier. So yes, I recommend Just Cause 2.			"

												Just Cause 2 is immense.  The gameplay of GTA but with a combat oriented missions.  If you love a secret agent themed story, the ability to use a myriad of weapons, boats, cars, bikes and places to cause untold destruction and havoc, this is the game for you.  One of the few games Ive spend 250+ hours playing, despite the repetitive gameplay, the action rarely gets boring.  The mission goals are coupled well achievements and together just keep you playing for one more mission longer.  Everything about the game screams quality, from the chessy voice-acting, the lush enviroment and settings, to the wonderfully rendered vehicles and characters.This is not a serious game but, its full-bodied serious action is unique in the 200+ games Ive played.  An inperfect game, but definitely my favourite one of all time.Unmissable!!			"

												Most of the time that I spent playing this game I was flying around with my parachute and driving cars of the bridge. The things that makes this game so awesome are the gigantic sandbox and the open world. Nothing is more relaxing then to hang and/or drive around in the map and blowing stuff up. You can just pull someone out of a car while you are going 120 km/h on the freeway, then fly away with your parachute and watch the car explode below you. I can't say much about the story because I only did about three missions. Don't regret a minute I played. EDIT: Now i successfully finished the story and multiple side missions, I can say that there actually is a pretty good story, what I did not expect. The main story is perfectly balanced with the time you spend creating chaos in throughout the map. This is due to the fact that you must create a certain amount of chaos before you can start playing the next mission. This way you will never start a mission when your weapons are not yet upgraded to the level that is required.8,5/10			"

												This game is some of the best fun I've ever had, you could be talking about the nuclear threat the country poses in one scene and then immediately be jumping out a car plummeting down a mountain the next one. The grapple hook always ensures you can do something fun and interesting and the sheer amount of explosions ensures me that this game is my bay-bePros- Hours and Hours of fun- Gigantic area of land to explore- Large vehicle and aircraft roster- EXPLOSIONS??!!Cons-Some faction missions are very repetitive- Not very many weapons (without dlc)-  Glitch means the game can't be completed fully is still presentOverall, I would say that you should buy this game if you want a free roam, not so serious game to joke about in and EXPLOSIONS			"

												When picking up this game, I didn't expect to sink so many hours into it. Essentially, the game is a summer blockbuster movie with more explosions than a Micheal Bay film after he drank a nitroglycerin cocktail with a dash of oil for flavour. Although the story, dialogue and voice acting are entirely terrible, I feel that this is a deliberate move by the developers in order to create the impression that it is your everyday blockbuster action movie with atrocious story in video game form. However, I think you could probably tell that part from the fact you sent a 4 by 4 truck covered in C4 explosives hurtling into a military base that seems to have a particular need for massive tankers filled with petrol in highly exposed and vulnerable areas and leap out, materializing yet another one of Rico Rodriguez's seemly endless parachutes from what appears to be the aether, and glide over as tanks of petrol, oil pipelines, telecommunication dishs, radars and towers made from corrugated iron all explode in a massive fireball about as bright as the sun whilst you pick off any remaining survivors with a gatling gun that you ripped off a turret point, as well as annihilate an attack helicopter piloted by a particularly angry government soldier. So yes, I recommend Just Cause 2.			"

												This game is just great. The sheer enjoyment of attaching a man to a fighter jet then jumping out of it and crashing it into an oil rig just is a small snippet of the infinite number of things to do in this game. The story lacks in some parts but mostly you don't care since the world just simply is a sandbox of explosions. This is a game that is quite unique and I think every one should play this at least once.			"

												There are HOURS of fun to be had in this game. I dare you to 100% it. The extensive open world map has impressivly fluid graphics. It consists of smaller areas such as military bases, large airports, cities, and small villages that can be 100% completed if you collect all boxes scattered within and destroy obviously marked structures (water towers, fuel towers, power stations, gas lines, etc.) though this attracts attention. This progress leaves you with upgrades and cash that can be spent on helocopter drops including weapons and vehicles. Once a place is descovered you can fast travel to it from your map.Of coures there is an arsenal of fun weapons (that can be expanded with DLC) though an FPS this is NOT. The weapons combat has a more arcade feel and there is apparently no such thing as stealth. Tuck yourself away with a sniper rifle to pick off the bad guys and you'll find one shot and everyones guns are instantly fireing at you. There's also no real reward for killing them. In the end you will find yourself almost always having to evade their infinte numbers and waiting for the cooldown before walking back in front of them like a different guy on the island in the same outfit as the guy just shooting them.The grapple and parachute make traversing the map extremely fun and easy. The grapple also serves a melee attack and can string together two objects including vehicles, humans, and unmovable serfaces. aah, good times. As mentioned in another review this would have been amazing to see in Farcry 3. As far as the story it's more or less just there to move you around the island for yet another mission and to unlock challanges. The story doesn't do much to deepen your experients with the game so don't expect The Last of Us story line action movie style. The misions and challenges are still fun and do well for breaking things up with different types of action. I don't want too sound too negative in my review but i won't gush over it either like another greatest game ever. However, I would highly recomend this game to any PC gamer (especially if you can get a deal) if only for the kicks and giggles. If it was missing something before it was multiplayer. But as of the date of this review the multiplayer mod DLC was released on Steam. Happy Gaming.			"

												This game is fun when played in short bursts...its fun to just run around blowing stuff up, but it gets really annoying if you play for an extended period. It crashes a lot, the controls for flying planes are incredibly awkward, enemy AI is obnoxious, story missions (both main mission and side missions) are really contrived and boring, and the physics for driving cars almost kills any fun you can have from then, which is too bad, considering how massive the map is, and how much fun it is to drive across. When you start going fast in pretty much any car, if you spin or drift just a little bit, you flip all over and fly a few hundred feet. When you hit any little bump, you get hurtled into the air and it happens again. So, basically, you can manage to ignore all these stupid things if you play for short periods of time...and it is worth playing...so much stuff to blow up, and a huge, diverse map...its just too bad it has so many obnoxious and frustrating problems.

Just Cause it’s fun TL;DR Just cause 2 is a fantastic open world game with so much content to explore. Blow your way through Panau using enemies and objects as weapons. The grappling hook in this game is your best friend , it can be a great way to move around or a fun tool for attaching enemies to moving vehicles. With many secrets to find this game will have you playing for days. The only downside being is that the story is just thrown in and you wont remember it.Follow us here Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipPros  Huge explorable mapsSatisfying explosionsHuge variety in vehiclesFilled with entertaining events Cons Very weak storyPoor quality cutscenes---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GameplayWith just the grappling hook there are so many ways that you can cause chaos all over Panau. The game world is your playground with a near endless amount of destruction to be caused, there is no real punishment for attacking anyone but attacking the military is a better idea because the send reinforcements to be played with. Even though driving is slower than just grappling around all vehicles control so well and can be used in interesting ways to destroy the environment. StoryThe story is the weakest part of just cause because of how little it matters, While having some amusing references to real world politics. Characters The character in just cause are just stereotypical of certain culture and none of them seem to care about the destruction you bring with you. Every single time you interact with an npc to start a mission they basically always ask you to blow everything up till you win. Art/Graphics The massive map gives a plethora of beautiful environments, everything you can see on the map you can explore and there are many secrets to find. The world feels very natural as they mix purely natural areas and a few miles away there are military districts and towns. The games color pallet is never dull even in rain storms there are bright mixes of colors that look amazing.Bonus Notes The games DLCs are just things that max the game more silly and would agree getting them if they are in a bundle. Just cause 2 is one of the best open world games and will give hours of entertainment.If you like this join us here to get the latest Reviews:Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group : http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipWhat would you like to see for our next review ?

Half-way to my destination I spotted a military base that looked like it needed blowing up so I ditched the 747 (I'm sure the passengers were fine) and parachuted down to the base, stole an attack helicopter, and laid waste to the base.

												To get this out of the way, this is not a game which will impress you with a great storyline. The voice acting is pretty terrible, a lot of the missions are pretty cliche etc. But that's all the negatives I can think of. The gameplay itself is where Just Cause 2 shines. A lot of epic, fast-paced action, Hollywood explosion escapes, loads of baddies to slaughter, a ridiculously large, beautiful world to explore with the help of your hookshot and parachute - there's just so much to do in Panau! As long as you don't pay too much attention to the plot you'll most likely love this game. ""Just one more hour... okay... a couple...ah, damn, it's been five already?!""			"

												Just Cause 2 remains to be one of my favorite games even though it's 5 years old. Just Cause 2 managed to give me around ~500 hours of gameplay on Steam and X360 combined. Even though the story is short and bland, the gameplay managed to keep going back to it.GameplayThe gameplay might seem repetitive to some, but usually is blowing up♥♥♥♥♥♥while preventing yourself from being killed by Baby Panay's military forces. On freemode, you mainly go around the vast amount of cities in the game and destroying objects that help you ""capture"" a town so you can get 100%. The game mainly tries to attract people who like explosions and creative ways to kill people to try to detract from its repetitive feel.			"

												If you like open-world chaos-causing action games this one is definitely worth the few dollars you can buy it for.  It features an absolutely huge open world (GTA, Far Cry, etc have nothing on this map size).There is a lot of variety in missions, side quests, vehicles, collectibles, etc.You have a hook that fires off of a device on your arm which you can use for climbing mountains, buildings - or just open your parachute and use the hook to keep pulling yourself forward to fly around!You can fly jets, get out, stand on top of them and shoot things.  I mean, it's rediculous.There's also a free multiplayer mod now that is kind of fun.My only complaint is that vehicles handle a bit odd, but you get used to it.			"

People compare it to GTA and they really shouldn't, both are sandboxes but in my opionion GTA takes its story a bit more seriously and the mutiplayer is a different beast. The mods add features into the game as well, some are silly, some are nice. Really looking forward to Just cause 3			"

												To get this out of the way, this is not a game which will impress you with a great storyline. The voice acting is pretty terrible, a lot of the missions are pretty cliche etc. But that's all the negatives I can think of. The gameplay itself is where Just Cause 2 shines. A lot of epic, fast-paced action, Hollywood explosion escapes, loads of baddies to slaughter, a ridiculously large, beautiful world to explore with the help of your hookshot and parachute - there's just so much to do in Panau! As long as you don't pay too much attention to the plot you'll most likely love this game. ""Just one more hour... okay... a couple...ah, damn, it's been five already?!""			"

												Most open-world games should start having to use the term open-city because one of the most striking things about this game is the size of the world. It is absolutely HUGE. You really feel like you are on a small island nation because scale wise you literally are. A quick cruise around this world will quickly reveal the second selling point for this game. It is absolutely stunning. Just drop dead gorgeous. You have to see it to truly grasp it.Once you're set free in this jungle hot box you really are set free. You don't have to progress any further in the somewhat bland and repetitive story and can instead spend the rest of your days blowing everything to pieces.The final real stand-out feature of this game is the ease and support for modding. There is a robust modding scene with some really great mods that do everything from fix annoyances to turn you into superman. Probably the most intriguing mod is the currently in-work multiplayer mod which, even in it's semi-closed beta state allows well over a thousand players to play on the same map at one time. That is not a typo so keep an eye out for that at some point in the future.All-in-all this is a must play for open-world fans always and a no-brainier for everyone when on sale.			"

												There are a lot of improvements from his antecesor.The driving it's stable, but you still can't shoot your weapons from any vehicle while the others still can. It's true that the police it's able to shoot you from their cars because it's the passenger that does it. But the ones that drives the motorcycle doesn't have passengers and they still can shoot you while driving. But now you don't drive very often since you have a better way of transportation: Your grappling hook and parachute. They have created the best way to travel around the island. By just grappling something and opening your parachute you can go faster than a car and you don't need to worry about what is ahead of you. The only thing that is better than this it's just the helicopters and jets. The helicopters because you can attack your enemies more efficiently and the jets because you can travel the island faster. You can also climb with it and it makes running and walking very obsolete. It's like the whip in Super Castlevania IV. You can do everything with it and it makes everything more easy for you to do.The shooting system has been improved too. The ability of using 2 single handled weapons can make you clean an area very fast. Rocket launchers are useful now that you can have more ammo with it.Enemy helicopters are more forgiving now that they don't spam you with rockets every time you are on a vehicle. They are still a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ but it's a balanced pain.The missions are entertaining and if you fail it's because it was your fault, not theirs. But I hate that sometimes they tell you what you have to do after wandering in circles while everyone shoots you.The multiplayer mod it's just that. You and a bunch of players in one big island as a playground. Some servers let you join a team, play custom missions, or just be a free for all where you all fight in the rave club because why not.I recommend buying it with the Just Cause Collection. It comes with the DLC and the first Just Cause. So you can also experience how bad it's the prequel by itself and in comparison with this one.			"

												Not to sure where to start with this game, because to begin with I was a little sceptical, and saw this game as a cheap rip-off of GTA and FarCry combined.Oh how wrong I was. Now I don't know where to start, as the game, put simply is incredible.First things first; maybe people will be quick to tell you the story is rather short lived, and the side missions drag a bit. While some might say this, in my current clocked gametime (about 15 hours I believe) I have completed a mere 9% of the game. I haven't been powering though the story, but why would you want to? This game is so beautiful and detailed that you can easily spend hours wandering the mountains and villages, basejumping from the skyscrapers in the financial district, hijacking aeroplanes and helicopters from the various island airports, racing fast cars down huge open motorways, racing slow cars off the sides of the mountain tops and darting through settlements at high speeds using your grappling hook.And that's just stuff you can do before you unlock anything in the game through story missions or side quest rewards.The graphics in this game are breath-taking, and the detail and thought throughout the island of Panau is simply remarkable. Add into all of this the reality physics engines (and the odd ragdoll moments, of course!) and the unlimited replayablity of this game, then even if you do decide to power-storm the story and rampage towards the 100% mark (which might seem hard at first, but a clever in game tracker allows you cheevo-freaks out there to hunt down every crate, drug drop, skull and blackbox) then even after this, you can safely assume you can quadruple your total gametime just playing about with everything this game has to offer.It is currently priced at £9.99, and for that much I can guarentee you will not find a better game to clock hundreds, if not into the thousands worth of game time.If it's on offer (really doesn't need to be, worth EVERY penny) and you don't pick this diamond up, you might as well just take your computer, climb a high mountain, chuck it off and at least give something the chance to experience the 'Just Cause 2' life.

I find it unbelievable that this game came out four years ago and still looks better than many games today *Cough* Watch Dogs *Cough* Call of Duty *Cough* Also the stunting iin this game is fantastic. The endless possibilities with stunt jumping, surfing on planes, grappling from car to car, the amazing combination of the stunt parachute and grapple makes travelling a ton of fun.Whilst the story is not amazing, the pacing of the game is great, always putting you in great action setpieces. The missions are all incredibly fun, whilst the takeovers may be a bit repetitive they are still great fun to do.So yeah PLAY THIS GAME!!!!			"

No matter how good a PC you have, it WILL stop responding at some time and crash.  That is, for me, the only con of this game.Overall, I would definitely recommend you to get it. The game has a multiplayer mod as well, which is quite intriguing.8.6/10.			"

It's true that the police it's able to shoot you from their cars because it's the passenger that does it. But the ones that drives the motorcycle doesn't have passengers and they still can shoot you while driving. But now you don't drive very often since you have a better way of transportation: Your grappling hook and parachute. They have created the best way to travel around the island. By just grappling something and opening your parachute you can go faster than a car and you don't need to worry about what is ahead of you. The only thing that is better than this it's just the helicopters and jets. The helicopters because you can attack your enemies more efficiently and the jets because you can travel the island faster. You can also climb with it and it makes running and walking very obsolete. It's like the whip in Super Castlevania IV. You can do everything with it and it makes everything more easy for you to do.The shooting system has been improved too. The ability of using 2 single handled weapons can make you clean an area very fast. Rocket launchers are useful now that you can have more ammo with it.Enemy helicopters are more forgiving now that they don't spam you with rockets every time you are on a vehicle. They are still a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ but it's a balanced pain.The missions are entertaining and if you fail it's because it was your fault, not theirs. But I hate that sometimes they tell you what you have to do after wandering in circles while everyone shoots you.The multiplayer mod it's just that. You and a bunch of players in one big island as a playground. Some servers let you join a team, play custom missions, or just be a free for all where you all fight in the rave club because why not.I recommend buying it with the Just Cause Collection. It comes with the DLC and the first Just Cause. So you can also experience how bad it's the prequel by itself and in comparison with this one.			"

Maybe drive a car right of a bridge? Maybe even collide an airplane with another? This freeroam action sandbox game is great for you!			"

												This is a game that will knock you're socks off, constantly. The graphics are breathtaking even in 2014 (arguably better than some other games currently out on the market.) The game play is good, consistant, although, the driving feels like the roads are ice instead of asphalt, the bikes are my favorite mode of transportation. This goes on sale, OFTEN. If you feel like you don't want to shell out 3 dosh for this, you are missing out on a great opportunity to experience to explore one of the more expansive and beautiful open world games in the early dawn of this century. For those of you just buying it for the multiplayer mod, thats fine too. It's a must to get that mod with it, but you would be just scratching the surface. The modding community for just cause 2 is expansive. i reccomend that you take some time to check out www.justcause2mods.com. The mods are free and so is sign up. The campaign isn't really anything to write home about, same blockbuster action with some cheap thrills mixed in there.If you are looking for an expansive open world game look no farther. Decent gameplay, amazing graphics and an all inclusive modding community make this one of the best games i have had the privileged experience of owning twice and spent countless hours on. Bottom line: ITS WORTH IT. GET IT!			"

												Just Cause 2 isn't your average Third-Person Shooter game, it's a completely unique twist.  This game is all about HOOKS, GUNS, DIVES and DESTRUCTION.+ Satisfying Action.+ Plenty of variety among vehicles; - A little less in guns though.+ Controls are easy to learn and use.+ Grappling hook mechanism is really fun to use and very well implemented.+ Even though the game was released in 2010, the Graphics are pretty darn good.+ The MAP is HUGE and takes a lot of time to explore. It has lots of scenery, moutains, water bodies, objects, building and much more.+ Game provides a lot of freedom, which is hard to find by in recent titles.+ Game has full 360 Controller Support, but I prefer KB/M because of the precision aim required to land hooks in extremely bizzare ways :)- Story sucks. (This was a huge turnoff for me atleast.)- Most of the missions are exactly the same damn thing again and again. You will do the exact same thing just at a different place with different clothed allies.- Unless you like to destroy everything, attach objects with hook for no-reason and do crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥. you'll get bored easily.- Game has some stability issues and crashed 3 times on my PC in 3 hours of gameplay. - The saving feature sucks, sometimes it over-writes your manual save with auto-saves. It auto-saves when you die, so the last checkpoint during a long mission is usually somewhere near the start of the mission.A lot of my friends just absolutely adored this game because of the freedom, flexibility it provides. The game will also tolerate any crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥you want to do and you will have an amazing blast if you are that kind of a person.  But for me, I look more in a game. I look for immersiveness and the ability of the game to keep me interested in it at all times.Final Thoughts:I got the game for about $3-4 and it was well worth the price.  I'm going to 'RECOMMEND' this game if you can get it within $7.5 which really ins't hard since the game is 4 years old and goes on sale pretty often.			"

												This should have been the gamers' game of the year. will start off from the very thing that got me hooked to this game.It's the map. This game has the second biggest game map ever created to date (I was told that FUEL has the biggest map which is 5,560 square miles)Just cause 2 map is 37 by 37 kilometers. A couple of kilometers on each side of the square map is water, so let's go by 35 by 35 kilometers. Multiply 35 by 35 and there you go - you have 1,225 square kilometers of map to explore, give or take 100 square kilometers.For the comparison, let's take the Fallout 3 map. That map is about 35 square kilometers.The Oblivion 4 map is roughly the same size.GTA 3 is 35-36 square kilometersGTA 4 is 15 square kilometersAnd I thought the Far Cry 2 map was huge. It's 50 square kilometers.The ARMA 2 map was definitely the biggest one before Just Cause 2 stepped in. The most important reason why i bought the disappointingly unoptimized ARMA 2 is to simply explore the roughly 400 square kilometers map.I remember wondering when I was younger if they would ever make a big enough map for a game which I could explore for days and days and days. I thought they finally did that with Arma 2, and despite the fact that I still could not play the game on maximum settings even when my rig should have easily taken on almost 2 ARMA 2's (According to the ""recommended settings""), I still loved the fact that I could enjoy the country-side that I haven't been to in years.The second thing is that we ACTUALLY have directx 10 in this game. FINALLY, how many more directx 9 games are we going to have? We have directx 11 already, so what's the deal? The directx 10 pretty much seals the deal and completes the game map that I still cannot believe they made. I also cannot believe that the entire game fits on a DVD, how the HELL do they pull that off? shouldn't the map this size be at least 30 GB? I mean Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventure is like a 30-35 GB game.Well, the third thing is... Ah what the hell, you know the rest. Complete freedom of action, unrealistic stunts, the temporary to permanent abandonment of the laws of physics, infinite parachute, a hundred of drivable vehicles, a cute Easter egg, the Hatch from the first and second seasons of LOST, the pleasure of having to spend 20 minutes just to fly from one end of the map to another on a stolen government jet, the joy of swimming in the sea (wish they had sharks though), the eye candy explosions that you never get tired off, the realistic driving of the vehicles (aside from the way they rotate in mid air sometimes), the realistic damage to the PARTS OF THE VEHICLES THAT WERE ACTUALLY DAMAGED IN THE IMPACT, I could go on and on about this gameIm also playing this game on IMPOSSIBLE and find it quite easy to beat. You just move constantly, shoot (There is sadly a default auto-aim option enabled that you cannot disable) and press ""tab"" or whatever you have to evade bullets. HOWEVER, a nearby grenade explosion is almost guaranteed to kill you, so for MAXIMUM realism, I recommend playing this game on IMPOSSIBLEIm not gonna complain about the check point system, I love the checkpoint system. it makes games more challenging. Plus there still is a SAVE option, although it doesnt work in its original meaningThe story is blah. Who cares? Some of the missions that they give you though are somewhat original and a breath of fresh air from some of the repetitive GTA missions. However, most of those missions are, attack, kill, destroy, blow up, move on. It would have been nice if they added an element of stealth to the game though. It would feel great if could actually play as a somewhat silent or stealthy lethal saboteur. I would also like it if they imposed a penalty for killing civilians both on purpose and incidentally.I know this game won't win the game of the year award since there is no real substance I guess, but unofficially, this will probably be the gamer's choice No 1 game of 2010. (I hope Metro 2033 wins the game of the year though, which I rationally know it won't)This game is a pinnacle of guilty pleasure if I can say that. It absorbs so much of my time that I barely have enough time for myself, and its only my second-third day of playing the game. For the third day in the row I come to work late with blood-shot eyes. I actually prefer to staying home and playing this game all weekend and after that, instead of going out with my gf. That's how much impact this game had on me.If you are an extremely busy person with a busy schedule, i do not recommend playing this game until you find some time to kill, otherwise you'd get the plants vs zombies syndrome, where you cannot stop playing the game and start missing out on life. But I guess, now it's gonna be the Just cause 2 syndromeI don't want to get emo about this but I'll say honestly that it's actually games like these that make me sorta happy that I was born with enough luck and resources to actually play them, but I'm only speaking for myself here.Until then, the most rational case for you is to buy this game, support the developers and enjoy it fully until your eyes bleed and your brain melts, since forgetting about reality as much as possible should be the just cause of all gamers.

												Well if you're into action packed game that has nothing else to offer but action , then this game is good for you.Basically i didn't have fun playing this game as its just stupidly repetitive , there's almost no story or something interactive to do than just killing people , blowing up some building and using every vehicle you could possibly think of.-Gameplay: there're lots of notes about it positive and negative: 1 ) character control is pretty much smooth and easy to use 2 ) vehicles controls are pretty much the best thing about this game 3 ) some missions can be glitched or bugged (which can ruin ur whole game completion)-Story: trash , short , stupid and pointless sort of.-Graphics: are fairly decent for the year of release and price.6/10 not worth full price at all , i'd recommend getting it at 85% discount or something.

												This game really surprised me in a lot of ways. In short, this game is a cross between GTA and Far Cry. If that interests you, please read on. If not, this game may not interest you.There's going to be quite a bit of negative, so bear with me.- The shooting and control mechanisms in this game are clearly made to be played on a console, or at least with a controller. There's aim assist, and there is no way to turn this off, and the enemies cannot hit me.- The text smoothing is horrific, and the menus look terrible. Images, too, are incredibly low resolution and even at 1920x1080 on max settings, all of the images and text looks blurry. Motion blur persists on my machine with each game restart for some odd reason, no matter how many times I turn it off and save those changes. - The amount of damage vehicles take is highly inconsistent as well; some cars cannot be destroyed no matter how hard I try; seriously, I tried! Some started smoking and falling apart only after a few bullets, and blow up with one grenade anywhere, while others can take any amoutn of fire and only blow up with a grenade under the engine. Also it is NOT POSSIBLE to shoot enemies through car windows or windshield; you need to get on top of a car and attempt to enter it with 'E', then enter a series of three integers ranging from 1-4. I do not know what happens if you fail to hit the correct buttons, since it's near impossible to mess it up.- No reprocussions come from just killing allies (friendly fire). In other similarly styled open-world yet linear games, the Far Cry franchise in particular, in the last two games there has been a karma system, and killing allies subtracts karma points which in turn affects the game's rank progression and unlockable missions and items. - I'm sure you can find a playthrough out there of someone only using the grappling hook as transportation/weapon. I'm serious, you can use this for everything; it takes 1-3 hits to kill someone with it from my experience, and has a huuge range. I f used correctly and on the right terrain, crossing over mountains to reach a destination can be nuch easier than driving on the designated routes.- The storyline is hilariously bad. This could be a positive for some people. I personally hate cutscenes and games which try to connect on a deeper level with the player. Fortunately, most of the cutscenes can be skipped, but not all. Dear lord, definitely not all.- The ususal gameplay bugs and glitches.Now for the positives.- The game has aim assist, the enemies are dumb, and they have a very low hit accuracy compared to other games. This is good because it allows the player to not worry about perfect cover and aiming accuracy, making it a great casual game to play when you are relaxing after a long work day. Sometimes you need to just run in to an enemy camp guns blazingand just kill some bad guys. This still does not excuse the lack of an option to turn this feature off.- Vehicles can take a large amount of damage before needing repairs. Driving is a lot of fun in this game because you can drive across all sorts of terrain, and have easy controls. Great for the same above reasons; fun casual gameplay.-The grappling hook is loads of fun to use. I still find it thrilling to flu through the air, hang off of helicopters, cliffs, etc. and I love to knock people off of their motorcycles or scare people by car surfing or taking over their vehicles. Overall I highly recommend this game for it's sheer casual gameplay and fun mechanics. for $15 this game is worth the price, and is a compelling buy for anyone who likes opwn world game with a linear storyline, like Far Cry, with the driving mechanics and modern city setting of GTA.

												A complete blast to play.  Story isn't great, but that's not the point.  Steal a car, loose control, crash it into a gas station, this starts a 20 minute firefight with the military which ends with you hijacking a helicopter (in mid-air, mind you), flying off into the mountains, ditching it in a forest, and laying low until they back off.  Something this ridiculous will happen each and every time you play.  And it never gets old.			"

												Just Cause 2 is the sandbox genre DONE RIGHT. It's not subtle or entirely realistic, and it knows it. Some of the combinations you can pull off are hilarious and amazing. The controls feel fantastic, and vehicles have a wide range of feel to them. The dialogue is horrible. Horribly AWESOME. The graphics are top-notch, every few seconds is a perfect screenshot waiting to happen. Lots of destruction, lots of options, and the grapple/hookshot is a solid gameplay design desicion, not just a gimmick. It doesn't have a terribly deep story or characters like GTA, but it makes up for it just by being ridiculously fun.I'm starting to think Squeenix should just make these games instead of FF from now on. I can't remember the last time I cared about a FF game. 9/10			"

												Really good open world game with lots of destruction and an interesting gameplay mechanic that hooks you into the game. With the grapple hook and parachute you can go anywhere quickly and efficiently (No walking for minutes on end). The graphics are also quite nice and it runs well even if you don't have a gming PC (40 fps on high settings on my laptop). The setting of the game also differs from the usual city you usually see in open world games, and is a beautiful island with many settlements, mountains, military bases, and destructable objects. My only complaints with the game is that the isn't really a big enough variety of Cars and there is virtually no cunstomization for your character. Other than that its definetly a must buy at $15 and can easly provide over a hundred hours of gameplay (I played 30 hours and im only 40% done the game, even though I finished the story).			"

												Just Cause 2 is the single best open world action title released to date. There is no other game that allows you to do anywhere near as much as this game does, no other title gives you such an enormous sense of freedom and satisfaction. The game is visually stunning and contains some of the most exciting and beautiful moments I have ever witnessed whilst playing.The gameplay system gives players a variety of ways in which to move around their world and explore the beautiful tropical island of Panau, starting the player of immediately with a grappling hook-parachute combo that is a fantastic innovation by square enix. You are able to slingshot yourself using your grapple hook and parachute in unision, paraglide of the back of a boat, or -if you purchase the DLC- you can fly around using your parachute thrusters which are fantastic. The hook is fast and precise and very fun once you learn to use it effectively; it also allows you to 'Dual hook' objects and entities together for some entertaining results.The story isn't great and the voice acting is horrible, but I almost wonder whether this is the game poking fun at action movies that often suffer these tropes, however this dosn't detract from the experience much as the missions themselves are greatly varied and interesting.The DLC is reasonably priced and well worth shelling out a few dollars for as they add some great new weapons and wehicles. I particularly favour the parachute thrusters and the Air Gun that fires compressed air to blast enemies and vehicles high into the sky!If you like open world games then this is definitely one to look at, I have played for over 100 hours and I'm ready for the next  100 (: so go on, buy the game!

												I played Just Cause 2 on the XBox 360 for a couple of years and had a blast. I recently saw it on a Steam sale and realized I missed it, so decided to take a chance.And I'm so glad I did: the truly open-world, free-flowing, do-what-you-want nature of it is so refreshing after so many other games that promise an open world, but often come with clever, but limiting, obstacles to wide-ranging exploration. The vastness of the world is unlike anything I've played. Flying in the fastest jet still takes minutes to traverse the set of islands, and there are no loading screens or lag.It is an easy game to play for 20 minutes, or 20 hours. Do a long, involved Agency Mission or just grab a chopper and take down a few water tanks.It works well with my XBox 360 controller on Windows 7 64-bit and nVidia 660 GPU. It also works well with my 60-year-old fingers and eyesight.Like Borderlands and Fallout, a game I keep coming back to when I just want to wander around aimlessly and shoot something.			"

												This game is amazing. It brilliantly mixes a gorgeous, tropical open world, full of lush vegetation and towering mountains, with a fast pace, high octane action that looks like it just came out of an action movie. The campaign seems generic at first, all about the political issues of the island of Panau, but when coupled with the slightly strange protagonist, Rico, it creates a humorous adventure. I highly recomend this game, because, as well as all the features described in this ""review"", its only £9.99!			"

												It plays a lot like Grand Theft Auot. There is a lot of stuff I like about this game, but there is some sketchy mechanics. Multiplayer is pretty fun and I think there is a lot of potential for improvement. If this game is still 80% off, get it now!			"

												A great sandbox game, especially considering how often it's on sale.Some of my favourite things to do in the game include driving buses off cliffs, using cars as wrecking balls, and of course everything involving the grappling hook.At it's very core the game is actually a collectibles game... Collecting upgrade parts for armour, weapons, vehicles and various other sorts... Destructible objects also count as collectibles, so find and destroy basically everything... There are over 3000 or so things to find and destroy across 400 or so miles of island, so should certainly keep someone busy.The game also has Multiplayer now in the form of a mod, so that should adds even more gameplay for only 3-15$Really there's no reason to not own this game for the price of a couple of candy bars.

												While this game can deliver on your desire for open-world, free roam destruction and action, I was still left a bit disappointed. After playing a great mil-box title like Mercenaries, I was left wanting very soon after beginning JC2. Most if not all of the unlocks are a wank, the guns are vanilla and snoozy, there is little variation in the monotonous grind of blowing up targets for gold. Without an airstrike mechanic like in Mercenaries, there is little to keep me playing for more than an hour. If you're looking for a straight-forward, blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up experience, this will deliver. If you're looking for immersion and progression on par with late developer Pandemic's titles, look elsewhere. Pandemic just knew how to make military sandbox gameplay awesome. RIP to a great developer.SCORES:Action : 8Story : 6Unlocks : 2Replay : 5OVERALL : 6Buy on sale only. Im looking forward to potential improvements in JC3!			"

												I remeber watching Michal Bay movies on the weekends, and thinking if they combined the explosive, jumping out of planes fun from the movies, into a game, it would be totally kickass. Well, squarenix must have thought the same thing, because here they are, providing me with Just Cause 2. In this game you will be embarking on edge of your seat missions, great sound, and stunning graphics. This game is mostly about the afterplay though, and less on the real story line. Jumping on top of moving planes to high-jack them never jets old, and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the government could never be so  satisfying. Although, most of the mission cut scences start out with a faction jeep or truck drving up, telling you how to do the mission, and then drving away, a little dissapointing. The island looks great, and the transition between day and night is stunning (awesome sunset). This game is totally worth the money, and should be bought for fun that can only be found here. 4.5/5			"

												Just Cause 2 is a single player sandbox game that scores major points for being extremely fun to play while looking deliriously pretty in the process.  The game lets you drive tons of cars, motorcycles, trucks, boats, jets, helicopters, etc, but the base mechanic of flinging your grappling hook out and then launching yourself into the air with the help of your infinite supply of parachutes is just ridiculously entertaining and so fluid to control that you'll rarely ever want to travel about in any other way.  Seriously, the parachute hook-shot combo of transportation and quick escape NEVER gets old.There's a story but it really doesn't matter because the fun is in the willy-nilly combat and parachute mayhem.  As a bonus, *MAN* it looks good with great environmental lighting and color choices.  Lots and lots of fun, I guarantee.			"

												Amazing fun, it's a great way to let off steam by blowing up cars, tearing down monuments and having lots of fun overall.

												This game includes a grappling hook and a parachute. You can use a combination of the two to get practically anywhere on land in the game. You can skydive, grapple the ground (as soon as it's in range), and stand up like it was nothin'. You can pilot airliners, jets (if you can actually take off without dying), boats, boats with mounted guns, cars, cars with mounted guns, cars that are like tanks, actual tanks, helicopters, military helicopters with gatling guns, military helicopters with gatling guns and missiles, and stolen cop jeeps. Did I mention that the gatling guns and missile attachments on vehicles have infinite ammo? Did I mention that you can walk around with a gatling gun and be practically invincible because that also has infinite ammo?You can kill people by grappling them to the ground. You can go past locations and get chaos points for no damn reason. You can flip chasing cars by grappling them to the ground. You can play this game without a dedicated graphics card, but it'll be in slo-mo on low quality.So, if you like explosions, acting like Spider Man, ripping statue heads off with a helicopter, waiting 5 years to get to some place by parachuting off a mountain, and raining down infinite hell on military bases, this might be the game for you.While you're at it, go grab Just Cause 3; it's like 2, but with 10x everything *cough*infiniteC-4*cough*.

The choice is yours.I haven't tried Just Cause 3, but apparently it improved in some ways but was a let down in others. But why not try this first?

Chase down a racer, blow up a base, hijack a plane or lead the police on a chase. do anything you want to, Well as long as you can handle the police that will respond to it. by the way (spoiler) if you get this game ther is a small island that is worth checking out. and the DLCs just add more perfection to an already perfect game.

												Just Cause 2 was a game I've looked into for a while, but never really thought about getting. Once it was sold for under $4 during a sale I had to give it a shot. This game was worth it, and I've sunk many hours into it quickly.Just Cause 2 really sticks next to it's name. Why? Just cause! Why else would you go into a millitary base, bombard it with a jet, dive bomb the plane into the raido tower and then drive a car off a cliff to give a horrific flash back when you rolled your car that one day.It really is a interesting experience, but the campains, either the main one or sides missions, are very repetative. The storyline is quite weak and is easily forgotten during the gameplay as you blow up more oil rigs.But the gameplay is what makes it worth purchasing. It's got an odd Grand Theft Auto: San Adreas feel to it. You know? The day you only have a half hour to kill beofre going to do something, so you load up the game to cause mass chaos and fear until you have to go. It's one of those games, and it does it quite well.Pros:Good gameplayDecent mechanicsNice graphics and aestheticMap size bigger than anything I've seen, even bigger than GTA VInteresting ways to use your grappling hookCons:Little money rewards and expensive weapons and vehiclesThe large map means that most places look the sameThe AI isn't very smartPlanes will explode when touching anything, even at speeds that you can out runMy rating 8/10, worth the purchase, at retail or sale price.

												I bought this game, because my pc isint good enough for Just Cause 3, but JC3 just looks so good, and JC2 is just  the older version, so I bought it on the sale, with all the dlcs.This game is amazing, i enjoy it so much. It is a lot like JC3, just no wingsuit, and a few other things, but the wingsuit is the thing that you will mis the most.The map is 4 times the size of GTA V's map. In order to progress, by doing missions, you need to blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up. Like legit, just cause damage, and you get a new mission.I think they could change the currency system, because your ammo depletes after evry base, and then you need to buy a new gun for about $50 000 , but you get $7 000, from a mission, so yeah i never have money or guns.

												An amazing open world game, with fun gameplay and heaps of things to do, through missions or just messing around. Yes the story is a bit lack luster and voice acting is a bit terrible, but this is just cause 2! A game where yes, it's a little bit cheesy, but the action is awesome fun. The graphics are beautiful with a massive map to explore, the gun play is simple, as well as the upgrade system for cars and weapons, a large amount of vehicles to drive, from tuk tuks to super cars, a boat load of easter eggs around the islands of panau and the game lasting you quite a while as you cause chaos!With the multiplayer mod out action increases massivly. Especially in massive servers. Take to the skys, drive in a convoy,♥♥♥♥♥♥people off, what ever you want!I definitly would recommend to anyone who enjoys open world games, and lots of action.			"

												What do you get when a developer puts less effort into writing a story, and more resources into great gameplay? A great game.Sure, while we like our storylines, not many people will be getting halfway through this one probably (i know I haven't), because of the incredible world and game.The world is real; it has to be. Panau is so detailed and so large, that it is one of my favorite game worlds ever. It might even hold first place. There are all types of biomes, from desert to forest to mountain snows to vast oceans etc.The gameplay is priceless. I might be driving a car around, observing the driving laws of Panau city, then be blowing up stuff with a max heat level in 30 seconds! (True story)Also, the game is beautiful, and possible to run on almost any machine. My current PC runs it maxed at around 90-100 fps, but my old craptop took this game to 25-30 on minimum, it'd been at 45 if I changed some ini settingsFinal score: A deserving 9, for the game lacks a good storyline, and has annoying black market cutscenes, and pointless hijacking quicktimes.

												I know I haven’t made one of these in a few weeks, but now that I am reinvigorated I can continue to push out this garbage you soak up like Honey Boo Boo’s mom soaks up pork chops. Just Cause 2 follows its predecessor, Half Life, with shrewd double meanings in the title. In this case it means a just cause as in a lame excuse to stick it to the man or the phrase ‘just because;’ a trivializing dismissal of all careless actions. For example, why grapple a soldier to a car and bum drag him through the suburban streets? Just cause. Now that you understand the title I’ll tell you what the game is about. It revolves around grappling a soldier to a car and bum dragging him through suburban streets. Experiencing sandbox games to their fullest potential is a skill I obviously lack. I have no idea why you’re trying to destabilize the government through chaos as you do in this game. Then again, asking a player to cause disorder in an open world game is like asking the office lunatic to steal your pens.Your character, Rico Rodriguez, is the physics defying godfather of both CJ and Niko Bellic in the sense that you can order cars on the black market or simply “find one” in the possession of a “generous” local, but most of the time you will be using the combination of the grappling hook and parachutes to get around. A feat only accomplishable by Rico himself which is where physics defying comes into play because parachutes seem to only be useful for forward momentum rather than actually slowing a fall. Instead you could simply pull yourself faster to the hard concrete floor using the grapple and somehow not become the next Red Sea. However, all of this is simply the chocolate cover of the Mars Bar waiting for you to see the tasty, gooey inside. Actually, who the hell am I kidding? The story takes place in only 7 missions so it is essentially non-existent.  So that ends that. Surprisingly, I’m not being paid by the Mars Bar company.			"

												Just Cause 2 is an action packed game with various islands and plenty of missions to be getting on with. It is set in a fictional place called Panau and has various islands like a city district, desert, mountains and a jungle. If your not the person who likes shooting things and blowing things up, you can do races which contain bikes, cars, planes and helicopters, but seriously who dosen't like destroying things here and there! There is a multiplayer mod which comes free with the game and this is fun to play with friends becasue you can sabatage your friends and kill them, blow things up and have infinate boost in vehicles and it's so easy to crash! Going back to the single player, the driving simulation is done very good in all vehicles and you can perform stunts on vehicles and watch the vehicle crash into the military! One of the best things about the game is the ability to have infinate parachute's and the ability to have a grapling hook. With the hook you can tether objects together, escape from the military, climb up walls, mountains etc and pull people off ledges and motor bikes! Overall I would give this game a 9 out of 10 becasue the stroy line is ok and there is so many things to do there is limitless fun and destruction!			"

												I love open-world/sandbox games. I also love shooting, high-speed chases and faffing about just doing stupid things whenever I feel like. I also dislike being the bad guy, despite my love of blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up.With that in mind, why buy Grand Theft Auto, which is crap and makes me some gangster-wannabe ♥♥♥♥♥♥, when I can buy Just Cause 2 and play a cross between a secret agent saboteur and BATMAN while still being on the good guy's side?This game hinges on screwing about; the more havoc you cause by blowing things up (particularly important stuff like power generators, fuel pipelines, water towers and military generals), the more missions, weapons and vehicles you unlock and the more MONEY you get to buy said weapons and vehicles.I'd gush about this game more, but there's a character limit. So if you just wanna have FUN and not care about anything else, just go buy this game already, jeez!			"

												Pretty good game, with a ridiculous amount of area to explore, but the best thing is it runs on my sh*tty laptop at 50 fps on medium settings, the only downside is some of the DLC like the parachutes they reset when u die, restart a checkpoint or leave the game, and since they are not cheap (50000 $) its kinda badly designed, but overall its a very good game.

												Over the top, ridiculously fun.  Like Saint's Row 2, it takes all the fun parts of the GTA series and none of the ""serious bits"" and lets the player romp across a MASSIVE island filled with loads of toys (helicopters, boats, motorcycles, rocket launchers, etc) to wreck havoc.  The hookshot and parachute mechanics are excellent and add a whole dimension to transportation.  Highly recommended.			"

												With South American flare and cheesy over-the-top puns, Just Cause 2 bursts onto the screen with all the James Bond-esque action and explosions imaginable. Playing as rogue assassin Rico Rodriguez, you fight your way across the fictional country of Panau, trying to take down an evil despot with the help of some of the most memorable characters to graze the screen. While ridiculously over the top, Just Cause 2 enhances virtually everything that made the first installment so much fun, with an amazing spectacle of explosions, beautiful vistas and ridiculously ludicrous stunts. Definitely bang for your buck.VERDICT: 9/10			"

												Just Cause 2 sports more style than substance.  But, that doesn't take away from the breathtaking open world of Panau.  Story wise is pretty much like the last game and is very forgettable, ""Overthrow a corrupt Government by causing chaos in the region"".  The main character ""Rico"" is a very generic action hero badass who is pretty much the equivilance of every 1980s action hero that creates the character.  I felt like the lack of character development and story is done on purpose because really, it's not all that important.  The reason however why most of the substance flaws are made up is because of how much effort Avalance Studious took their time to make the beautiful world as well as the masterfully executed gameplay mechanics this game has to offer including the infamous ""grappling hook"".  Overall, the story is not important but I recommend this game for the open world exploration, action, and many features of mass chaos.By the way if you don't already know, there is a bug that if you complete the full game of Just Cause 2, it will say 99.99%.  If this happens don't worry because this is only a minor bug and the developers are not supporting the game anymore because of Just Cause 3. Also, this game doesn't have mulitplayer, but there's a mod that someone created and is avalible on steam right now.			"

												I bought this game on the PC just as a frustration killer. I already have played it a lot on the 360 and it was selling for 5 bucks during the Black Friday sale and I thought, why not? Blow stuff up. That's literally what the game is about. Create as much chaos as possible and the game will reward you for it. To add to the fun, theres the grappling gun, inifinite parachutes, some interesting ways to control vehicles and HUGE open map to go crazy in. Its a formula that works flawlessly. This game is meant as a pressure valve;♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at something or want to chill after a long day? Few things will help as much as this game; wanton destruction seems to appeal to just about anyone. Be warned though, it does have its flaws - the story and characters are a joke (though I sense the developers use it ironically, and taken in that context, they work pretty well!), the AI is thicker than an obese cinder block house and there are some minor control issues.Dont expect anything mind-blowing and/or contemplative in the story/character department - they are as bad as it gets - instead, play it for what it was made for - silly, mindless fun.

												Ok. Just Cause 2.After playing the demo for this game countless times on ps3, and then getting the full game, and playing it countless times, I was excited to see what joys the PC version of the game would bring.What was my answer? Well, it was pretty much the same. I couldn't expect more though - because after all, you can't improve perfection. If you don't have this game, you should get it. If you already have this game, you should play it. Have you 100%'d the game? I thought not.ALSO: Mods! Who could forget. I lied. You can improve perfection. How? By having 100 police officers chasing you while you set off a nuke-sized explosion in a supercharged rubbish lorry, of course.			"

												Just Cause 2 is a game that is packed full of fun and value, especially as it is often cheap in Steam sales.  The first thing I like is that it actually encourages you to cause chaos.  You earn chaos points for death and destruction caused to the army, buildings and vehicles of the regime that you are trying to destabilise.  There are plenty of weapons to cause this destruction and the grappling hook is a lot of fun.  Use it to climb about with or attach one end to an enemy, then attach the other to a vehicle, or a gas cannister, which you then puncture and watch them fly about then explode. Beyond the death and destruction, it is quite pretty and I was happy with the graphics.  The missions are fun and there are a ton of side activities that you can do if you fancy.  The map is quite large and there is a lot to explore, from little villages, jungle bases to sky scrapers and the big airport.  The addition of the free mulitplayer mod has some novelty, having no AI enemies, but lots to explore, cars, boats, planes  and weapons to play with and PVP if you fancy.  The airport seems to be the area where a lot of the PVP action and crashing passenger jets goes on.  Lots of fun and lots of value.			"

												Just Cause 2 is distilled fun. Plain and simple. Sure, the story may be lacking, the voice acting bad, and the things you can survive make absolutely no sense. This is because this game wears ridiculous as a badge of honor and focuses on what is enjoyable about the gameplay. You'll cause more explosions than every action movie from the 90's put together. You'll do things with the grapple hook and parachute that laugh in the phase of physics. You'll travel a world that is honestly much, much bigger than it NEEDS to be. And you will love all of it.This game has many flaws, but it is such a joy that you will be hard pressed to hold any of them against it. That is not something I can say about too many games.			"

												Just Cause 2 is an amazing sandbox game. After the first two cheesily bad missions, you're dropped right smack in the center of Panau, a small totalitarian country of islands, with few guns or grenades and all cities occupied by the government. As you gain in strength, upgrading weapons, vehicles, and your health, you become stronger.      As you work with 3 different criminal factions, the government loses territory. There are 3 factions: The Roaches, a mafia of sorts with a leader who speaks in medical terms; the Reapers, Panau's own branch of the Communist Party; and the Ular Boys, strong traditionalists opposed to all foreign customs.           There are vehicles galore (though too many Tuk-Tuks and motor scooters) and lots of collectibles and destructibles. Much of the world is empty, but when you steal a tank and go on an explosive rampage, you tend not to notice these things. Overall, worth the price whether it's on sale or not.			"

												Just cause 2 is one of those games that doesn't need any recommendation, or word of mouth to tell the world how great a game it is!This sequel is the follow up to the 'Chaotic' open-world sandbox game - just cause, which was released back in 2006 for the Ps2, Xbox, and PC. What I love about just cause 2 is the fact you can free-roam an entire paradise island, with your main aim to cause as much chaos as possible to the open-world, so you can eventually topple the dictatorship in government.You can cause chaos by destroying military targets in much of the towns, cities, military bases, ports, and many more areas as possible. Because you play a mercenary named 'Rico', you get to play around with many cool 'boys toys' in just cause 2. The selection of helicopters, tanks, and guns to play around with in the game is immense.There's many fun easter eggs and secrets to find scattered around, with an island with much to do. So put down your current game, and join Rico on panau island.			"

												This game is reccomended for anyone that loves to blow sh*t up. Just Cause 2 is a beautiful game and has such precise weapons and vehicles to get the job DONE! The voice acting is simply remarkable and the graphics of the game is just breath taking! The glitches have hilarious outcomes and in Just Cause 2, you can make your dreams of defying gravity, come true! The grappeling hook has been attached to Rico's arm so you can shoot your gun and grappel onto people and surfaces (at the same time.) You can now do something called ""dual hooking."" Dual Hooking is where you take your grappeling hook and tether one thing to another, so I can take a Titus ZJ (a sports car) and tether that to a Pandak ""Baby"" Panay statue (statue of Panau's current dictator) and drive off in the Titus ZJ and the statue that I tetherd would fall down. Anyways, like I saud, I would reccomend this game to anyone that loves to play video games and to anyone that loves to blow sh*t up.Infinite / 10.			"

												I love this game but, it really ticks me off. Reasons I like it 1. Very open world/big world2. Rico's Humor (Rico is The Main Character) 3. Amazingly Pretty. There is a TON more stuff I like about the game but now to the bad stuffWelcome to the bad stuff this is why I do think someone may want to steer away from this purchase.1.You're a 5 year old this game is very much more teen/adult kind of game.2. This is the all time worst part about the game. Ok so I play on Super High everything on this game and I get 60-70 fps and it crashes like crazy. In my computer I Run a Nvidia 760 gpu, 16gb of ram, i5 4670k basecloked, Seagate Barracuda 1tb, WIndows 8.1 and the psu case and optical drive do not matter but the monitor is an Asus Vn248h-p. So the issue there is it crashes like crazy.3. Final Problem somtimes when I kill an officer and the sun is setting (beautifully may I say) the officer lets out a burst of red light and it is very distracing from the immersion. "

												Open world game, very repetitive but very fun. The world is massive and you job is to destroy anything that is destroyable. Gameplay is like GTA but with a hookshot and an infinite number of parashoots in one backback. Your grappling hook is centric to gameplay. You can use it with the parashoot to fly (glide with parashoot and grapple the ground far away to gain momentum), you can grapple objects together including vehicles, you can hijack planes by grappeling or you can simply use it to climb objects. Weapons, vehicles, and health can all be upgraded by destroying objects to get money and ""chaos"" or collecting various hidden items. When you get bored of that, look up the multiplayer mod. It allows servers to host games with several hundred people playing all at once!			"

												Explosive from the get go!This game is entertaining from the beginning, but after some time I could see where people could be led astray. Gameplay wise, it's similar to GTA with mechanical and graphical differences. Just Cause 2 gets at the idea of running around the game map doing quests, blowing things up for cash, and finding special items; all the while steal/buying cars and such, shooting things with whatever you can get, and causing chaos. Why? Just Cause, though there is a central quest with tons of side quests around.If you like GTA, but hate the overall environment of GTA this is for you! If you love GTA, this is a good change up of locations and idea. If you hate GTA, this may still be a good game for you since it lacks the vulguarity of GTA. Simple as that.			"

												Just Cause 2 is an open world blow'm-up simulator in the same vein as a Grand Theft Auto or Saint's Row; half the fun is messing with the physics of the world.The major success of Just Cause is that it gives players the tools to explore the world to its fullest extent. Your character's grappling hook is the most obvious of these, giving you the ability to traverse terrain at high speed, rope in enemies, or tie objects together. With a little imagination, it's the best thing since the Gravity Gun of Half Life 2... and both can be used to overturn vehicles!Furthermore, the protagonist is rather agile in his ability to manoever. While his ability to safely hop on top of a moving, swerving car makes little sense, it also makes him able to do fun things... like throwing delicious explosives at pursuers. He can ride anything, grab on to anything, and jump anywhere, and it results in a very liberating experience once you get the hang of 'the rules' of these manoevering abilities.As a car-jacking game, there are a TON of vehicles, and excuses to use them. Even when you acquire air travel and fast travel, there are many reasons why you'd use land vehicles; either they're more practical for quick getaways, have weapons attached, or you just want to ride on an occupied vehicle to keep your hands free to blow things up.There are only two minor downsides to this game. First, the story; it takes itself a bit too seriously for a game where you can tie someone to a jet as its taking off, and it doesn't relax its tone until the end. Second, this game lacks the ability for multiplayer - yes, there is an awesome multiplayer mod, but it's pure free-roam and without NPCs; the game proper does not support multiplayer when it feels like it should (having one player driving, another car-surfing, and another para-gliding would be an awesome way to make a getaway).However, these flaws are minor; the gameplay is satisfying, the world is gorgeous, and the price is right. Heck, the price may even be too low; Steam Sales have pitched this game as low as $2 when it is easily worth much more. Unless you really don't like gunplay and violence, this game is an absolute blast and recommended for anyone looking for some creative destruction.			"

												Notice: Before you read this, note that this is just my opinion, and you can make your own. I won't affect it.       Shoot the dang enemies.... Hook onto Kane's heli... Run like hell.... GO GO GO! Oh, hello there. I'm going to start with the basics. For anyone who loves GTA, but doesn't play it often, or it broke, or whatever, Just Cause 2 is there. At it's price, you can't beat a realistic game like this. Sorry, GTA, but JC2 is better in my opinion. In this game you play as a character named Rico, who has many missions to do with various clients. It's not the same and the same every freaking round and mission. Each mission has its own meaning, solution, cause, ect. I played the demo multiple times and waited months to finally get enough money to pay for this. This game is something else. Each structure blows up its own way. Also, pull enemies off of feet with grapple hook, 5000 out of 1000Anyway, this game is unique for its grappling hook system. You can tether things together, pull things toward you, slap people with it, hook onto cars, drag bodies, tie two bodies together to make them slam in midair. This game is different for the colorful, but dark environment of the destructive missions, a few with multiple ways of solving them. There are amazing missions, but it still has its share of amazing free roam action. If you get into the right place, you can mess around with the environment. There is a variety of different weapons and vehicles, ranging from jeeps or pistols, to helicopters and explosives. There are quite a fair bit of special things to destroy that are found randomly around the map, many achievements, and other things to make this game quite an amazing one. If I could rate on a scale of 1-10 of everything, here's my list:Gameplay: 8.5 - It's good but can get fairly confusingGraphics: 9.0 - They are amazing and colorful, but if you have an old computer, you will lag quite a bit.Destruction System: 9.5 - It is amazing. I am a rather large fan of destruction myself. I find as many games with realistic damage systems as I can. There are few. Ones like this, Battlefield, and all those others fulfill that want. Vehicles: 8.0 - There are many to choose from, and you can hijack them, shoot the people out, blow the vehicle straight out of the road, and more. It has a realistic driving system as well.Weapons: 9.5 - Now here's the good stuff. There is a crapton of weapons to choose from, whether it be modded or put in the game on the start. There are SMGs, MGs, LMGs, Rockets, Pistols, and other things too.The way it is unique is the grappling hook. You don't see many games with those, do you? I give the grappling hook a 9.5 out of 10. Why not a full 10? It can be tricky to use sometimes, with a partially screwed up range. I feel it is a bit too short of a range. It is fun to use however, as it has multiple funny uses. For example, pulling people off of their feet and them saying ""HELP! HE CAUGHT ME WITH HIS WIRE THINGY!"" and them trying to untie it, but utterly failing, and launching into the air where you can shoot them. Another is tying them to a civillian car, and the civillian in the car having not the slightest idea there is a person they are dragging around, and killing the hitchhiker slowly.AI: 6.5 - Why? The AI has a ridiculous amount of health, but nothing like the super aim sniper noob AI in Sniper Elite V2. This AI is smart, can detect at a reasonable skill level, and other things, but it feels a bit overpowered with its health.Mods: (Unrated currently) - I haven't really modded it yet, only really the multiplayer mod, but I can easily imagine I'd love the mods.Multiplayer: (Unrated Currently) - I have only one friend to play with on it, and I haven't done it yet. I can imagine there'd be a few unimaginably good players out there, but a few not so good average players out there. Others are in between. Don't get me wrong, I can imagine I'd enjoy multiplayer apart from the fact I SUCK AT FPS AND TPS!FINALLY, THE MOMENT YOU'VE (maybe) BEEN WAITING FOR,My overall game rating and whether or not I recommend it, 9.5 out of 10 scorpions. Yes, I know. I had so many positive things to say about it, but like any other game, it has its negative parts, and I will list those after this rating. This game is a unique third person shooter, but its AI isn't that good. I mean come on, they are social butterflies who scream a lot and are way too, um, They have way too much health. Let's just say that. I can land 3 headshots and they simply wont die. I can shoot them in the chest, or any other vitals multiple times, and they're all like ""NOP EIM FYN HEEHEETEE""(Translate from Panauan) (Nope, I'm fine TeeHeeHee)THE NEGATIVE SIDE:Like I mentioned multiple times, it is a very laggy game for those older and weaker CPUs, and it takes up a lot of space. It works, but imagine... It could be a crapton better on old computers, but NOOOOOAnd I mentioned this single thing twice: The AI is buggy.Where to start with it. It IS a fairly good AI, but the health and voices are annoying to me. I feel like I can't even play a game without hearing that voice, and I got this game the same day I wrote this review (6/5/14) I mean, come on.The last two things about the negatives. Price, and Graphics.This game is worth paying, but I feel it costs a little too much for weaker computers. It's like adding a high price and slow speed for bad graphics cards (Wait, isn't that exactly what it is?) Anyway, maybe if they brought the price down to 10 dollars, then it would be more fair. I just don't find this price amazingly fair.FINALLY, Graphics: The graphics are good, don't get me wrong, but they just BARELY work on slow graphics cards. I have a slow card, and 75 percent of my deaths in the game are from lag spikes. Maybe make the graphics less ""WHOA, THIS LAGS MY SLOW GRAPHICS CARD"" and there would be even MORE buys.Overall, YES, I recommend this. It is awesome with all of the good things, but the graphics and price could be more fair for us steam (and Square Enix game) players. If you love a simple destruction sandbox with missions and a twist, look into this game and maybe even buy it. You won't regret it. Now, what are you doing reading this? GO BUY IT NOW! "

												Explosive from the get go!This game is entertaining from the beginning, but after some time I could see where people could be led astray. Gameplay wise, it's similar to GTA with mechanical and graphical differences. Just Cause 2 gets at the idea of running around the game map doing quests, blowing things up for cash, and finding special items; all the while steal/buying cars and such, shooting things with whatever you can get, and causing chaos. Why? Just Cause, though there is a central quest with tons of side quests around.If you like GTA, but hate the overall environment of GTA this is for you! If you love GTA, this is a good change up of locations and idea. If you hate GTA, this may still be a good game for you since it lacks the vulguarity of GTA. Simple as that.			"

												Don't look at the Steam stats, I've played this game for many hours on the PS3...and that was just a demo. It's good enough to keep me replaying the same 15 minutes over and over again because it's just that fun. Blowing up broadcast towers with a pistol, swinging through the air on a grappling hook hanging from a statue and then landing on the ground perfectly fine, to proceed to kill a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of enemies and come out without a scratch. PROS:+ Excellent visuals for a 2010 game+ Endless hours of explosions and♥♥♥♥♥♥like that+ Can slingshot through the air+ Explosions+ Able to leap from a plane and deploy your parachute 3 feet from the ground and land perfectly safe+ Explosions+ Great controls on PC, despite being made on console+ ExplosionsCONS:- Runs a little dodgy on PC, working components way harder than necessary- Difficulty spikes are terrible: can go from taking down thirty weak enemies and blowing up a silo without needing a health pack to dying twenty times over and over because there's a wave of fifteen heavily-armoured enemies coming straight for you			"

												JC2 is what i like to call a first person looker. You play as Tom Ka-lancy, who is known as the sedadu/scorpion, and you get to go around looking at stuff. The game has really cool♥♥♥♥♥♥ like hot air baloons, and rope. The main objective of the game is to use your hardcore grappling hook, and tie the bad guys togeather. Although i find this kind of lame because youre not getting any headshots.As for the story, you are basically an average american citizen, but then you decide to move to the bahamas, but instead you end up on some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ island, you have no money to get back to the US, so you decide to become a criminal. You have 3 choices, you can join the cockroaches, the Ular boys, or the reapers. Since the reapers own everything, you join them, and basically tear♥♥♥♥♥♥up All in all, JC2 falls short of its predecessor, DeUs ex: human delusion, but if you're in the mood for some nice visuals, and dont really care much about sick as hell headshots, then this game is up your alley.

												After playing for almost 70 hours, this game is enjoyable, with different things to do and objectives to complete other than just simply missions. For instance, the Race Challenges provide a decent challenge and reward the player with a decent reward. However, when looking at the game as a whole, there are some aspects that could have been better rounded off rather than just placed in the game, such as the item collection. With around two thousand collectible items in the game, along with 360 different settlements for completion, make trying to complete this game a monotonous task. In addition to the mundane grind for game completion, the story isn't all that great. All in all, this game satisfies those that want more fast-paced action than substance in the giant, yet somehow empty, open-world environment that is Just Cause 2.			"

												This game is one of the best open world, shoot kill and steal (and blow up) anything games around. If you can stomach slaughtering thousands of southeast asian people essentially ""because 'merica"" then nothing should stop you from enjoying this.The main character is a combination of every action hero you can imagine, Spider Man(stanks to the magic grappling hook/human harpoon), and maybe a little bit of a 40K Space Marine. The morality is  greyblack, and civilians are fair game if you so desireas  slaughtering innocents only garners attention from the villainous military police force that supposedly cares nothing for the people of the nation. It's essentially GTA turned up to 11 and given a more militant vibe. The story is less amusing than the GTA series, though not totally dry. But seriously, who cares about story when you can be a violent terrorist and mass murderer?Also worth noting is the multiplayer mod, which strips many assets and all NPCs off the map and allows you to go on a killing spree against friends and well wishers. Just beware that the chat channels are essentially Anon centric as far as I've seen.			"

Funny voice acting, horrendous grain on the cutscenes (don't know what they were thinking on that, it looks♥♥♥♥♥♥. Good visuals, great to skydive in. Also, you don't have to buy the DLC, it's really not necessary, buy the vehicles if you like them. Runs great on any pc, overall really fun game even if you don't like many games of this type.			"

Posted: November 8, 2015
												The following review is pretty lengthy. It's up to you whether or not to read it.Just Cause 2 at its core is the epitome of open-world freedom. The world is fairly saturated with color, from the lush green trees of the jungle, to the rich brown jungle trails, to the tan and orange deserts, to the pure blue water. It is by no means the most gorgeous game out there, but personally, I have respect for the art-like, cartoonish style.STORYI would say that JC2 doesn't try to take itself seriously, but that wouldn't be the complete truth. The story, while not the greatest ever, does take itself seriously, with a few generic characters such as:-The Patriotic, bacon-eating American-The super attractive, blonde, American Bad-A** soldier-The skin-tight suit-wearing, heavy-accented, incredibly intelligent Asian operativeAnd a few more! The story itself is... Well, It's no ""The Last of Us"", that's for sure. However, that's okay! The objectives and goals you actually get in the Agency Missions are a ton of fun for most of the time! There are also multiple ""gangs"" or ""crime lords"" you can do work for, in order to expand their influence over the country of Panau. The missions these gang leaders give out can also be very fun at times, however, the stronghold takeovers can get a little old. They essentially go like this: -Escort a squad of gang members through a military compound. Use a grapple hook to get over the gate, in order to open it from the other side, thus letting your allies in.-Keep the hacker alive at all costs-Defend the hacker while he hacks some sort of system-And finally, kill the stronghold commander to complete the stronghold takeover.As gamers, we all know that escort missions can be a huge pain in the rear, however, I've had no trouble whatsoever with these missions. What is the point of these stronghold takeovers, you ask?Well, if you are killed in action in free roam, you will respawn back at the nearest stronghold, ready to get right back into the action!CHAOSBack on the subject of missions, the way in which you actually gain access to these Agency Missions and Stronghold Takeovers is simple: BLOW S**T UP! Chaos is what fuels missions! By weakening the military government in free roam by assaulting bases, destroying fuel lines, destroying military vehicles, killing military personelle, overloading nuclear reactors, (etc.) you are not only having a blast by playing the game, but you're also progressing the story! I personally have not seen this replicated in any other game, and I find it to be an effective and fun way of progressing the storyline.GAMEPLAYTo keep it pretty simple, you're equipped with a grappling hook. An incredibly useful tool, the grappling hook can be used to climb buildings and mountains, attach to vehicles, link two objects together [and more, if you download the mod that lets you tether multiple things together], pull enemies off of high areas, gain momentum while parachuting, and even more. Have fun experimenting with the possibilities! I sure have!As you cause more Chaos, you gain more items to purchase in the black market. You can call the black market dealer using a beacon, and when he arrives, you have three options:-Buy a certain weapon / grenade-Buy a vehicle-Extract to any previously discovered location on the mapThe more Chaos you cause, the more options you will have available to you. You can also call the black market dealer during missions should you ever find yourself low on ammunition, or just needing a new toy.You can also find vehicle parts, weapon parts, and armor parts. Vehicle and weapon parts can be used in the black market screen to upgrade weapons and vehicles, to do things such as increase damage or increase top speed. As for armor parts, for every five you collect, you gain a health increase. OTHER NOTABLE PROS, AND CONS-Almost cringey voice acting among the natives. Incredibly exaggerated accents, and once I caught a female NPC misreading a line and then correcting herself. If bad voice acting is a dealbreaker, watch some gameplay on YouTube to see if you can bear it+Vehicles, helicopters most notably, being destroyed are much more realistic than in other games. (Minor detail)+Explosions have a satisfying sound (Minor detail)+Rico's animation for detonating C4, followed by the sight and sound of explosion, makes you feel like a total bad-a**+World size is MASSIVE, and I hear one of the islands is similar to the island from the TV Program ""Lost"".-Some key bindings are better off in different areas. I always change my key bindings in games as soon as I play them to make sure I'm comfortable, but I recommend anyone should change the defaults to what they see fit.-Weapon damage model for SOME weapons is a bit low. Unrealistically low. An M4 could take someone down in one bullet in reality of course, and this game is not reality, and frankly, this game is basically telling you ""I'm NOT realistic AT ALL, and that's the point of the game!"" However, if it was a bit quicker to kill an enemy, it would be welcomed. (MIGHT be fixed by upgrading weapons)-No indication of a kill on an enemy. Occasionally, a bullet will knock an enemy to the ground. Thinking they were dead, you turn to deal with a new target, only for the previous enemy to get right back up. A good way to make sure you've secured the kill is to watch and see if the enemy has dropped their weapon when they fell. While this works just fine, some kind of hitmarker would be welcomed. THE FINAL VERDICTJust Cause 2, while being a slightly older game, is an absolute blast to play. This game just literally lets you do whatever the hell you want. If you play Grand Theft Auto 5 in single player to have fun in the sandbox world, but dislike being killed so easily and want to just feel like a bad-a**, this game is your answer. (Note: Not once did I mention Grand Theft Auto 5 being a bad game, please do not get upset over nothing)I rate Just Cause 2 an 8.5 out of 10. SOME bad voice acting and story, but incredibly fun gameplay and world design to make up for it.			"

												I know I haven’t made one of these in a few weeks, but now that I am reinvigorated I can continue to push out this garbage you soak up like Honey Boo Boo’s mom soaks up pork chops. Just Cause 2 follows its predecessor, Half Life, with shrewd double meanings in the title. In this case it means a just cause as in a lame excuse to stick it to the man or the phrase ‘just because;’ a trivializing dismissal of all careless actions. For example, why grapple a soldier to a car and bum drag him through the suburban streets? Just cause. Now that you understand the title I’ll tell you what the game is about. It revolves around grappling a soldier to a car and bum dragging him through suburban streets. Experiencing sandbox games to their fullest potential is a skill I obviously lack. I have no idea why you’re trying to destabilize the government through chaos as you do in this game. Then again, asking a player to cause disorder in an open world game is like asking the office lunatic to steal your pens.Your character, Rico Rodriguez, is the physics defying godfather of both CJ and Niko Bellic in the sense that you can order cars on the black market or simply “find one” in the possession of a “generous” local, but most of the time you will be using the combination of the grappling hook and parachutes to get around. A feat only accomplishable by Rico himself which is where physics defying comes into play because parachutes seem to only be useful for forward momentum rather than actually slowing a fall. Instead you could simply pull yourself faster to the hard concrete floor using the grapple and somehow not become the next Red Sea. However, all of this is simply the chocolate cover of the Mars Bar waiting for you to see the tasty, gooey inside. Actually, who the hell am I kidding? The story takes place in only 7 missions so it is essentially non-existent.  So that ends that. Surprisingly, I’m not being paid by the Mars Bar company.			"

												Now with the multiplayer mod out, there is no reason not to play this completely awesome game.""Cause maximum chaos"" is the goal of this game, and you have as many tools/scenarios available to you as your mind can think up.Use your grappling hook for both movement and being a♥♥♥♥♥♥to the populace and soldiers of this island.  You'll find out you can attach motorcycles to airplanes, you can attach that vehicle chasing you to the ground next to it, you can attach yourself to the top of that building over there and pull yourself up and away from danger.Goal of the game is to rescue your buddy who something something who gives a crap your real goal is to take over the island and rid it of all influence of the current dictator and his soldiers by any means necessary.By any means necessary is intentionally a very broad brush to paint this game with.There's a huge amount of vehicles (land/air/sea) available to you around the island that you can steal at any time, and a bunch more you can unlock, mod in, or get via DLC.   If there is anything you don't like about the game, you can either find a mod or if you are knowledgable you could modify it yourself.It's a really really fun game to play, tons of things to destroy even after you beat the game.  I've played for like 70 hours and have beaten the game but only 'defeated' 48% of the island.  It is a quite large place ingame.Most games little things here and there bug me but I cannot find any complaints about Just Cause 2, honestly.  Get it!			"

												I played this game more than 50 hours and that what I can say about this game:Just Cause 2 is awesome game, the enviroment is amazing, The ability to be free is felt by the combination between the grappling hook and the parachute, Modding is fine (not on his best but in its useful), The missions are realy fun to pass and play them right, The map is one of the biggest maps in the gaming world and just....... AMAZING GAMEHowever (for my opinion) the campaign feels short after I finish it, not enough missions and storyline at the missions.It feels like the main storyline devided between the factions there but they know how to do the missions - how to design and make them.Just Cause 2's multiplayer is just amazing!! Some servers  allow you to speed up to the maximum speed of your vechile, in some servers there are also activities/events such as: the last one standing, racing, Real-Life and even more, there is server of Real-Life.

												Just Cause 2 is an open world blow'm-up simulator in the same vein as a Grand Theft Auto or Saint's Row; half the fun is messing with the physics of the world.The major success of Just Cause is that it gives players the tools to explore the world to its fullest extent. Your character's grappling hook is the most obvious of these, giving you the ability to traverse terrain at high speed, rope in enemies, or tie objects together. With a little imagination, it's the best thing since the Gravity Gun of Half Life 2... and both can be used to overturn vehicles!Furthermore, the protagonist is rather agile in his ability to manoever. While his ability to safely hop on top of a moving, swerving car makes little sense, it also makes him able to do fun things... like throwing delicious explosives at pursuers. He can ride anything, grab on to anything, and jump anywhere, and it results in a very liberating experience once you get the hang of 'the rules' of these manoevering abilities.As a car-jacking game, there are a TON of vehicles, and excuses to use them. Even when you acquire air travel and fast travel, there are many reasons why you'd use land vehicles; either they're more practical for quick getaways, have weapons attached, or you just want to ride on an occupied vehicle to keep your hands free to blow things up.There are only two minor downsides to this game. First, the story; it takes itself a bit too seriously for a game where you can tie someone to a jet as its taking off, and it doesn't relax its tone until the end. Second, this game lacks the ability for multiplayer - yes, there is an awesome multiplayer mod, but it's pure free-roam and without NPCs; the game proper does not support multiplayer when it feels like it should (having one player driving, another car-surfing, and another para-gliding would be an awesome way to make a getaway).However, these flaws are minor; the gameplay is satisfying, the world is gorgeous, and the price is right. Heck, the price may even be too low; Steam Sales have pitched this game as low as $2 when it is easily worth much more. Unless you really don't like gunplay and violence, this game is an absolute blast and recommended for anyone looking for some creative destruction.			"

												- Physic- Bugs- Sometimes camera+ Huge open world with deserts, forests, mountains etc. (about 200 km squared)+ Grappling hook+ 104 types of vehicles, and lots of villages, towns, object to destroy, collectable things, roads... etc.+ Classic ""Just Cause"" story (with 50 faction missions)+ PrizeWell, you have huge open world, you can travel everywhere, use every vehilce. You can make a lot of fun with grappling hook, if you learn how to use it. You can destroy a lots of goverment´s things and help your 3 factions capture whole island and set a freedom. This game will catch you for about 20-150 hours (It´s up to you if you get 100% of game).The game has a lots of bugs, physic problems and camera is in few parts your enemy, but you have very big and beautifle map and you can run a game on old computers, so I think that bugs are a little problem. The game have a few DLCs with funny new weapons or vehicles and FREE multiplayer (not part of game, you have to download it). Well, except many bugs, a lot of fun for good prize.All in all: 88% "

												I don't know how the game brakes almost every laws of physics in each minute but I do like it. The game is a sequel to Just Cause (1) the story takes place in Island of Panau. You are a Agency cooperetive Rico Rodriges that does all the dirty work and caos. The Ruler of the government is torturing people, running infinite propaganda and running a dictatorship. You are equip'ed with a grappling hook that is attached on your left arm. This is a fun weapon and a transport to use against enemy infantry or vehicles. What can I say the game is fun in extreme amount and if you like action,blowing things up, Breaking the laws of physics, Flying with a self reloading parachute with a grappling hook that is non-realistic as hell but everyone goes with it. I DO recommend this. Hope this helped, See you in the sky!			"

												""HERP DERP YOU SHOULD GET THIS GAME JUST 'CAUSE""No. Get this game because it's amazing. It's an open world third-person shooter/grappling hook simulator/driving simulator/boat simulator/flight simulator. With movie physics.The story is just an excuse to have such a game, and the occasional missions or races can be fun if you tire of the do-whatever-you-want style of gameplay, but that won't happen for quite a while.The possibilities in this game are almost limitless. Grapple a tank to a plane and watch it take off. Parachute out of a helicoptor and see it crash into an oil rig. Flip a car over repeatedly as you drive it down a mountain. Carry around a minigun and blow up watchtowers. Climb a tall building to assassinate a general, then jump off, grapple to the ground, and drive away on your hovercraft. Run over a guy in a motorcycle and complain about the ""DAMN PEDESTRIANS!""The game makes no pretenses; your primary objective is to cause CHAOS			"

												Just Cause2 is an action adventure style game with an amazing open world experience. Everything in the game is drivable ranging from cars and tanks to military grade jets or civilian air craft.Your a agent with an amazing set of skills setting out on a mission to stop the islands dictator. You'll blast your way through armies and ravange through hundreads of towns, bases, cfities, and harbors to see to his end.It has several dlc that will add in things that you can purchase from the store as you wrack up money blowing things up. Things like guns, ammo, planes, tanks and cars.This is an amazing game though the downside being its very repetetive once you beat the game leaving you to complete side missions and liberate all the towns. But if you enjoy a free roam game that has amazing scenory and a large map to explore this is deffintly a game for you.			"

												TLDR? Just buy it and see for yourself. 10/10It is truly sinful that I waited until now to play this game. While the story is laughable, it really sets the stage for what this game is all about: grappling hooks and parachutes. I've been an advocate for strong storylines and atmosphere in games for years now, but this game alone has really reminded me of what it feels like to play a game purely for fun. To further sweeten the pot, this game has aged really well.Pros:-MASSIVE open world that lets you do everything from deepsea dive to skydive. No place is off limits right from the start.-A wealth of vehicles, allowing you numerous options for transportation.-Diverse environments including deserts, jungles, cities, oceans, and snowy mountain ranges.-Various weapons, including miniguns with infinite ammo for over-the-top rambo vs. helicopter scenes.-The best grappling hook I've ever used in a game. -Playable on lower-end machines. I am experiencing zero lag on my Asus with GeForce GTX 560M with 8gb ram. Cons:-Poor optimization. Expect bugs and the possibility of a little extra work to get this game running smoothly. (This was especially true with my Nvidia graphics card)-Forgettable story. While some of the characters are interesting, there wont be much to hold your attention here. -Initially confusing mechanics. It may take a little while to get acclimated to moving around with the hook and chute.Overall, this is a suprisingly fun experience that will easily consume countless hours of your time if you let it. For me, it's a wonderful way to decompress after a full day of work. 10 grappling hooks out of 10			"

												Notice: Before you read this, note that this is just my opinion, and you can make your own. I won't affect it.       Shoot the dang enemies.... Hook onto Kane's heli... Run like hell.... GO GO GO! Oh, hello there. I'm going to start with the basics. For anyone who loves GTA, but doesn't play it often, or it broke, or whatever, Just Cause 2 is there. At it's price, you can't beat a realistic game like this. Sorry, GTA, but JC2 is better in my opinion. In this game you play as a character named Rico, who has many missions to do with various clients. It's not the same and the same every freaking round and mission. Each mission has its own meaning, solution, cause, ect. I played the demo multiple times and waited months to finally get enough money to pay for this. This game is something else. Each structure blows up its own way. Also, pull enemies off of feet with grapple hook, 5000 out of 1000Anyway, this game is unique for its grappling hook system. You can tether things together, pull things toward you, slap people with it, hook onto cars, drag bodies, tie two bodies together to make them slam in midair. This game is different for the colorful, but dark environment of the destructive missions, a few with multiple ways of solving them. There are amazing missions, but it still has its share of amazing free roam action. If you get into the right place, you can mess around with the environment. There is a variety of different weapons and vehicles, ranging from jeeps or pistols, to helicopters and explosives. There are quite a fair bit of special things to destroy that are found randomly around the map, many achievements, and other things to make this game quite an amazing one. If I could rate on a scale of 1-10 of everything, here's my list:Gameplay: 8.5 - It's good but can get fairly confusingGraphics: 9.0 - They are amazing and colorful, but if you have an old computer, you will lag quite a bit.Destruction System: 9.5 - It is amazing. I am a rather large fan of destruction myself. I find as many games with realistic damage systems as I can. There are few. Ones like this, Battlefield, and all those others fulfill that want. Vehicles: 8.0 - There are many to choose from, and you can hijack them, shoot the people out, blow the vehicle straight out of the road, and more. It has a realistic driving system as well.Weapons: 9.5 - Now here's the good stuff. There is a crapton of weapons to choose from, whether it be modded or put in the game on the start. There are SMGs, MGs, LMGs, Rockets, Pistols, and other things too.The way it is unique is the grappling hook. You don't see many games with those, do you? I give the grappling hook a 9.5 out of 10. Why not a full 10? It can be tricky to use sometimes, with a partially screwed up range. I feel it is a bit too short of a range. It is fun to use however, as it has multiple funny uses. For example, pulling people off of their feet and them saying ""HELP! HE CAUGHT ME WITH HIS WIRE THINGY!"" and them trying to untie it, but utterly failing, and launching into the air where you can shoot them. Another is tying them to a civillian car, and the civillian in the car having not the slightest idea there is a person they are dragging around, and killing the hitchhiker slowly.AI: 6.5 - Why? The AI has a ridiculous amount of health, but nothing like the super aim sniper noob AI in Sniper Elite V2. This AI is smart, can detect at a reasonable skill level, and other things, but it feels a bit overpowered with its health.Mods: (Unrated currently) - I haven't really modded it yet, only really the multiplayer mod, but I can easily imagine I'd love the mods.Multiplayer: (Unrated Currently) - I have only one friend to play with on it, and I haven't done it yet. I can imagine there'd be a few unimaginably good players out there, but a few not so good average players out there. Others are in between. Don't get me wrong, I can imagine I'd enjoy multiplayer apart from the fact I SUCK AT FPS AND TPS!FINALLY, THE MOMENT YOU'VE (maybe) BEEN WAITING FOR,My overall game rating and whether or not I recommend it, 9.5 out of 10 scorpions. Yes, I know. I had so many positive things to say about it, but like any other game, it has its negative parts, and I will list those after this rating. This game is a unique third person shooter, but its AI isn't that good. I mean come on, they are social butterflies who scream a lot and are way too, um, They have way too much health. Let's just say that. I can land 3 headshots and they simply wont die. I can shoot them in the chest, or any other vitals multiple times, and they're all like ""NOP EIM FYN HEEHEETEE""(Translate from Panauan) (Nope, I'm fine TeeHeeHee)THE NEGATIVE SIDE:Like I mentioned multiple times, it is a very laggy game for those older and weaker CPUs, and it takes up a lot of space. It works, but imagine... It could be a crapton better on old computers, but NOOOOOAnd I mentioned this single thing twice: The AI is buggy.Where to start with it. It IS a fairly good AI, but the health and voices are annoying to me. I feel like I can't even play a game without hearing that voice, and I got this game the same day I wrote this review (6/5/14) I mean, come on.The last two things about the negatives. Price, and Graphics.This game is worth paying, but I feel it costs a little too much for weaker computers. It's like adding a high price and slow speed for bad graphics cards (Wait, isn't that exactly what it is?) Anyway, maybe if they brought the price down to 10 dollars, then it would be more fair. I just don't find this price amazingly fair.FINALLY, Graphics: The graphics are good, don't get me wrong, but they just BARELY work on slow graphics cards. I have a slow card, and 75 percent of my deaths in the game are from lag spikes. Maybe make the graphics less ""WHOA, THIS LAGS MY SLOW GRAPHICS CARD"" and there would be even MORE buys.Overall, YES, I recommend this. It is awesome with all of the good things, but the graphics and price could be more fair for us steam (and Square Enix game) players. If you love a simple destruction sandbox with missions and a twist, look into this game and maybe even buy it. You won't regret it. Now, what are you doing reading this? GO BUY IT NOW! "

												It is a good game really. Story is..wait what story there is no story. This game is for those people who just like to relax and cause chaos around the big world. There are a few bugs, still most anoying one is two freezed arrow pointing down. Car driving is also kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥(but believe me there are too many other awesome vehicles you will most likely use against panau military).Vehicles and weapons upgrading are very well made, there are also 104 (I think) different vehicles; map is huge and it involves everything form snow to desert to big town; new grapping hook is AWESOME, it feels like spiderman with guns; ""teleporting"" and unlocking new stuff are also well made But game quickly become the same overall and there are not alot of side and main missions but overall this game kick♥♥♥♥♥ Just don't expect to much from it.

												Explosive from the get go!This game is entertaining from the beginning, but after some time I could see where people could be led astray. Gameplay wise, it's similar to GTA with mechanical and graphical differences. Just Cause 2 gets at the idea of running around the game map doing quests, blowing things up for cash, and finding special items; all the while steal/buying cars and such, shooting things with whatever you can get, and causing chaos. Why? Just Cause, though there is a central quest with tons of side quests around.If you like GTA, but hate the overall environment of GTA this is for you! If you love GTA, this is a good change up of locations and idea. If you hate GTA, this may still be a good game for you since it lacks the vulguarity of GTA. Simple as that.			"

												Just Cause 2 might seem like a standard, open-world shooter, but there are a few gameplay mechanics that make it special. The first is Rico's grappling hook, which can be used freely at any time. Not only can this grappling hook allow Rico to zip around walls and hang from ceilings, but it can also be used to pull objects towards him. For example, shoot it right at a sniper and you can yank the poor lad right off his perch, saving valuable ammunition in the process.			"

												Let me first introduce myself. I am Jake, a fellow player. now i assume you are reading the reviews because you are tentative on buying it. well i recommend the game fully. it can keep you entertained constantly while still being fun 100 hours into playing. with a 400 square mile map there's plenty to explore. Chase down a racer, blow up a base, hijack a plane or lead the police on a chase. do anything you want to, Well as long as you can handle the police that will respond to it. by the way (spoiler) if you get this game ther is a small island that is worth checking out. and the DLCs just add more perfection to an already perfect game.

												Just Cause 2 is essentially an action movie where you create and participate in the set-pieces. Your jaw will drop at the amazing things you can and will do here – either intentionally or unintentionally. The game's open world environment allows you to really make your own game out of this; to use the weapons and vehicles you want to use and to do the things you want to do. Admittedly the game does have a few flaws that would likely break a lesser game, such as the ridiculous saving and spawning system and your inability to go inside many buildings (things I certainly hope are fixed in the recently announced Just Cause 3), but Just Cause 2 is not a lesser game and still manages to be endlessly entertaining despite them. With a great modding community to boot, Just Cause 2 is absolutely worth picking up, either at full price or during one of its frequent sales. It isn't Shakespeare, but it embraces and relishes in that fact. And if you like the gameplay of Just Cause 2 but wish you could throw topical insults at strangers while playing, check out the free Multiplayer Mod, which is basically to Just Cause 2 as Garry's Mod is to Half-Life 2.

												Interested in open world kind of games? Just Cause II has an amazing and really huge world begging to be explored. Here I was thinking about how big the GTA or Far Cry 2 worlds are; well, let me tell you they are tiny compared to the Panau Island (the place were Just Cause II story/events takes place). Graphics are amazing and pretty detailed too, you'll find from deep jungles to cities with huge buildings. If you are one of those people who need to have a 100% completion in games, good luck with this one, there are tons of things to collect, discover and do around the whole island; just to give you an idea, I did around 70 hours collecting all the stuff I could and got to 44% complete (story complete, but side missions and most of the collectibles still missing).While the game has a lot of action (i.e.: shooting people, jumping from airplanes, driving any type of vehicles, parachuting anywhere, destroying power plants or any type of ""government"" building, etc.), it really lacks of a good story and the voice acting is lousy giving you the feeling you are there just to explore the whole island.If you are into exploring and collecting lots of stuff without caring too much about the story, this is definitely the game for you!...

There is a TON more stuff I like about the game but now to the bad stuffWelcome to the bad stuff this is why I do think someone may want to steer away from this purchase.1.You're a 5 year old this game is very much more teen/adult kind of game.2. This is the all time worst part about the game. Ok so I play on Super High everything on this game and I get 60-70 fps and it crashes like crazy. In my computer I Run a Nvidia 760 gpu, 16gb of ram, i5 4670k basecloked, Seagate Barracuda 1tb, WIndows 8.1 and the psu case and optical drive do not matter but the monitor is an Asus Vn248h-p. So the issue there is it crashes like crazy.3. Final Problem somtimes when I kill an officer and the sun is setting (beautifully may I say) the officer lets out a burst of red light and it is very distracing from the immersion. "

If you are looking for an impressive storyline, look elsewhere - this game just creates chaos, explode stuff and does it amazingly well.

												Similar in concept to GTA, but far superior in many ways. The world is 400 SQUARE MILES of fully-explorable terrain, including multiple islands and the expanses of water in between. There are air and water vehicles in addition to cars. Your grappling hook basically turns you into Spider-Man. There's so much stuff to blow up (as part of the story, no less!). Impromptu car chases with the military are amazing, especially since the soldiers are hilariously incompetent drivers - count how many of their own they mow down while chasing you down the road!The downsides are that weapons are limited to less than a dozen generic guns, and the missions are rather repetitive and sometimes menial. But who cares when the bulk of your time will be spent seeing which car makes the coolest explosion? The missions are almost a diversion in this do-anything-you-want world.An excellent stress-relief game. Highly recommended.			"

												The NPC voices are terrible, the story is shallow, the vehicles are poorly tuned, the gunfights lack feedback, the goals are repetitive, and the DLC is too granular.And I love it to bits. This is a feel good game, standing out from a bottomless pit of soulless sandboxes with at best mean-spirited or insufficient premises. Ultimately that sums up why I love it: Rico has a just cause. And despite the obvious pun, he pursues it as a mostly well-meaning hero, not a chaotic blank slate. Never has wreaking unfettered havoc on an island paradise been so pleasantly justified. It also has the trappings of an action spy thriller, providing an appropriate thematic backdrop for the action and paying affectionate homage to the genre, but toning down the typical byzantine plot in favour of uninterrupted carnage and exploration.Even lacking polish in multiple areas, JC2 is conceptually superior to many similar titles. Much like the peerless Metroid Prime, it begins with a solid gameplay concept and builds a story around it, not vice versa. Unfortunately the plot is more or less a straight shot to the finale with few memorable twists or diversions, but on the other hand, it's harmless to the experience. Throughout the story and into the endless Mercenary Mode, Rico's personality and motivation is reinforced through small quips he dishes out in response to certain events. For instance, although there's no real punishment for harming civilians, once you hear Rico complain about ""aiming for the other guy"", you might prefer to avoid them. Happily, these quotes trigger sparingly and are still fresh after 100+ hours of gameplay.Here's hoping Avalanche Studios can create the perfect implementation of this formula in Just Cause 3. Until then, part deux remains a unique beast offering many hours of childish fun...and in deference to popular trends, EXPLOSIONS RAAAR SURVIVED A MILE HIGH BASE JUMP BY PULLING THE CORD A FEW FRAMES BEFORE HITTING CONCRETE 11/10 WOULD CONSOLE PORT AGAIN rico is mulatto-hispanic james bond maybe? woo ragdolls			"

												Go get the game. It is so much fun, the story is however lacklustre so far (didn't complete the story yet though). You will spend most of your time messing around within the world, completing side objectives and discovering new areas, and most importantly, causing chaos.Enjoy.PS: There is a multiplayer feature now via the modding scene. Didn't try that yet but just imagine the fun in blowing up military bases with another person			"

												This game is quite humorous, allowing you to fall thousands of feet, as long as you pull your parachute in the last 3 feet. You can travel the land faster than any car using grappling hooks and a parachute. You can roll out of the way of any damage and practically never die. If you enjoy blowing up an entire third world nation so they have the GDP of the United States in the 1930s then this is the game for you.			"

												A Mexican Power Fantasy: The Time I played as DeadpoolI jumped off a mountain, it was tall, full of snow. I was so high up, a plane was nearby. I pulled him out and threw him to his death, another life claimed by the hands of Deadpool. Since my ability to fly is horrible, I was about to crash into the ground. Right before that, I jumped onto the front of the plane, and grappled a nearby tree, the plane exploding behind me. I was in the middle of a military base, surrounded by military. I pulled out two sawed offs hot guns and took them all down, one by one. Soon, I stole a helicopter and flew into the sunsetJust another day in the life of Deadpool.			"

This game is very very nearly perfect, and has earnt the place as my favourite game of all time. Buy this game now and all the DLC, especially the multiplayer mod and the DLC that gives you the Quad Rocket Launcher very early in the game :DThis game gets and 69/8 because it is just too great.

If you are looking for an impressive storyline, look elsewhere - this game just creates chaos, explode stuff and does it amazingly well.

												With over a hundred hours of gametime and completing everything in the game I still enjoy playing JC2. It's like an action movie you play with ridiculous stunts and enemy kills in a huge open world map. I'd say you could get 75+ hours out of the game from doing all the missions and destroying everything. After that the game has a thriving modding community with all kinds of crazy mods adding hours more of gameplay plus a multiplayer mod is upcoming which will aloow you to explore Panau with your friends. Everything is very good quality except for it occasionally crashes when I have many mods running but it is not major. I totally reccomend this game.			"

												One of the manliest games ever released, Just Cause 2 is a playablesummer blockbuster by Michael Bay, but without the ""being an insult to the medium"" part.This is the only game where ""listen here, jackass, if you want the story to progress, go blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up."" is the modus operandi. But the story isn't this game's best feature, despite every single story mission trying to one-up the previous one.This game is a sandbox gift to mankind. You can drive any vehicle you run across, shoot any gun you run across and blow up anything that's remotely combustible. And you can go ANYWHERE.Alongside mostly believable physics (grappling hook not included in that regard) and gorgeous graphics, you get a package made with love and delivered by helicopter.Try playing other games now, you pipeline jerks!

												Ever wanted to play an action movie? Look no further; this game has GTA-style free roaming, a ridiculous plot worthy of Mission: Impossible, and endless squads of incompetent mooks to gun down. Or hapless civilians, if that's your thing.Just Cause 2 is by no means a difficult game or a fantastic story, but that's hardly going to cross your mind as you cruise through gorgeous scenery and cause more explosions than a Michael Bay movie.It DOES get a bit repetitive by the end, but still loads and loads of fun, and at a great price too. Especially RIGHT NOW AT THE TIME OF THIS WRITING due to the Steam summer sale; at 80% off, you can grab it AND all the DLC for just under 5 dollars (US).			"

												This game's storyline is bland and  some game mechanics are frustrating, but it does mindless fun better then most games accomplish. Being able to hijack a plane and crash it into enemy grounds and causing massive chaos is all one can really ask for sometimes.			"

												Go get the game. It is so much fun, the story is however lacklustre so far (didn't complete the story yet though). You will spend most of your time messing around within the world, completing side objectives and discovering new areas, and most importantly, causing chaos.Enjoy.PS: There is a multiplayer feature now via the modding scene. Didn't try that yet but just imagine the fun in blowing up military bases with another person			"
