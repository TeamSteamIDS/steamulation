												Once upon a time, Call of Duty was a legit, epic, ww2 shooter.There was a time where snipers camped and didn't run around quick scoping. There was a time where submachine gunners ran around and didn't camp in corners.There was a time where thermal scopes didn't exist and smokes actually did someting.There was a time where tanks roamed the battlefield and dominated over everyone.There was a time where 2-3 bullets actually killed you instead of 10-12.There was a time where shotguns weren't OP.There was a time where 12 year olds didn't sleep with your mom.There was a time where squeakers didn't dominate over people.There was a time where trolls didn't anger over-sensitive people.All in a place called Call of Duty: World at War			"

												When I was 10 years old I remember my dad getting me this game for Christmas. I remember playing the campaign and enjoying it and being scared by the zombie mode that was unlocked upon finishing the game. During this time I didn't have internet so I couldn't play online. Due to this I always played with my dad. I believe that lasted for a couple months and I begged my dad to get the internet set up so I could play with other people. Call of Duty: World at War was my first online game and it was a great experience. Campaign:- I would say the campaign in this game is fairly average, but one of the best Call of Duty campaigns.- You can play all, but two missions cooperatively.Multiplayer:- Personally, I thought this game had the best multiplayer out of all the Call of Duty games. I loved playing Hardcore          Headquarters, Hardcore Search and Destroy, and War.- Unfortunetly, this games feels basically dead these days and I don't really see a reason to play it.- On PC there is a problem where you get kicked from games for no reason by Punk Buster.Zombies:- This game comes with four fun zombie maps upon purchase.- There are loads and loads of custom maps to play- Four player coop.I honestly can't think of any negative things to say about this game. If you're looking for a game to play custom zombie maps this is the game for you!			"

Its fun, fast, and arcadie. In terms of singleplayer, this installment saw you brave the horrors of WWII from both a Russian and American perspective; battling the Japanesse on Iwo Jima http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=358229015and beating down the 3rd Reich from Stalingrad to Berlin. Featuring the voice talents of Keifer Sutherland for the American Sgt. Roebuck, and Gary Oldman for the premier of the legendary hard-as-nails Russian sniper - Viktor Reznov. The campaign is both compelling and fantasicaly written with mixes of close and ranged combat along a spectrum of locales beautifully designed and planned. The singleplayer is, as far as im concerned, unsurpassable by any other ""Call of Duty"" game. Multiplayer is still alive and active. The servers are very fun to play in and have a lot of active players on them. WaW's multiplayer is very fun and solid. It may have a couple of cheap moments like any other COD has. But it is still very enjoyable and can keep you entertained for a couple of hours.As always I leave the best for last. Zombies! Call of Duty: World at War's zombie mode is one of the best co-op experiences I have ever had. Its fun, gameplay is solid, theres a story, and it will give you and your friends hours upon hours of entertainment. The game comes with 4 solid maps to play on. Natch Der Untoten, Verruckt, Shi No Numa, and Der Riese. These maps offer great variety and are very fun to play in. Zombies is the biggest and most alive part of this game. With a community that has created thousands upon thousands of custom zombie maps that one can enjoy. Many map makers like ZCT and TMG provide high quality maps that can be compared to Treyarch's best. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=359152137You still reading eh?

												When Infinity Ward released Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare back in 2007, the developer was met with critical acclaim and praise for breaking away from the World War II setting that had started to bog down the once revolutionary series. That made Treyarch's decision to bring the fifth installment back to the historical time period that much more confusing - why mess with success? Well, Call of Duty: World at War returns to the series' roots, and is a good reminder of why World War II games became so popular in the first place - the tone is gritty, the pace is frantic, and the action is visceral.World at War's story is split between two very different fronts - the ferocious jungle campaign of the Pacific theatre, and the retaliatory invasion of the Russians on the Eastern front. That's right - no pesky Normandy invasions this time around! In the Pacific, you take on the role of Private Miller of the United States Marine Corps, and take part in the island hopping campaign towards Okinawa. On the Eastern Front, you play as Private Dimitri Petrenko, and are tasked with pushing the Nazis out of Russia and marching into Berlin. The campaign is paced exceptionally well so that after a few missions of fighting as Miller in the Pacific, you'll switch over to play as Dimitri in Eastern Europe. This stops the campaign from becoming stale, keeping it fresh and exciting.Perhaps the best part of the campaign is the sheer amount of variety found in the missions. The first mission as Private Petrenko, for example, comes straight out of the movie Enemy at the Gates. Narrowly surviving a massacre in Nazi controlled Stalingrad, you and an injured comrade have to make your way through the enemy filled streets armed with only a sniper rifle in order to assassinate the German General. In addition to sniper duels, you'll also have to burn out enemy fortifications during the campaign, as well as command a tank through enemy infested Germany.One of the most memorable missions has you playing as neither Miller nor Petrenko, but Petty Officer Locke, a gunner for a PBY Catalina flying boat. In addition to shooting down Japanese patrol boats, merchant ships, and fighter planes, you'll have to try and rescue American sailors stranded in the sea after their fleet is decimated by a squadron of kamikaze fighters. The mission is really unique, and the intensity ramps up significantly as more Japanese planes show up, and ammo starts becoming scarce. The first person views of the plane's interior as well as the exceptional dialogue make this mission much more than a standard rail shooting experience.Although it is overall an invigorating experience, the campaign does have a few faults - most notably, some annoying glitches. For example, in order to finish one mission, you have to regroup with your squad. The mission won't end, however, until you backtrack half way through the level and unstick one of your AI buddies with a grenade - something that obviously shouldn't make into the finished product. There are a few other minor glitches as well, such as the little grenade symbol by your feet sometimes staying on screen long after its explosion, but these usually don't have an effect on the gameplay, and are thus easily ignorable.As great as the campaign is alone, it's even greater with a few friends. World at War allows you to play through the entire campaign with up to three friends, and you can even turn on competitive scoring, much like in Halo 3, to add a new layer of depth when playing with friends. The other co-operative mode in World at War is the ever-addictive Nazi Zombies. With a few friends, you get to fight off a never-ending horde of Nazi Zombies, starting off with just a pistol. As the game continues, and the waves get progressively harder and harder, new guns are available to purchase. It's hectic and crazy, and although no Left 4 Dead, it is a heck of a lot of fun. If Nazi Zombies isn't your thing, then you might find World at War's multiplayer more enjoyable. Treyarch took the super addictive multiplayer system from Modern Warfare, and it still is great. Classes, perks, prestige classes - it's all here. Of course, some of the technology present in Call of Duty 4 wasn't around back in the 1940's, so Treyarch did have to make a few, slight changes. For example, instead of being able to call in Helicopters after getting a killing streak, you can bring in attack dogs to attack your foes, or call in artillery strikes to bombard enemy positions. The essentials are all the same however. You get experience points for killing enemies and winning matches, which can be used to unlock new, powerful guns, weapon accessories and armor, and better perks. The prestige class returns as well, allowing you to return to level 1 after reaching the maximum level. You can do this up to 10 times, so if you are dedicated in getting to the top, be prepared to put a lot of hours in World at War. The graphics in World at War are stunning, with dazzling explosions lighting up the screen and individual character models looking impressively detailed, especially up close, such as when a Banzai soldier jumps on you with a bayonet in your face. The animations are spectacular as well, with no two soldiers dying the same way. You can even blow off individual body parts off with certain weapons, like the shotgun, which is of course extremely satisfying. The game's audio also stands up extremely well. The game features big name voice talent such as Kiefer Sutherland and Gary Oldman, and the soundtrack is immersive and fitting. The guns sound realistic and appropriately powerful - you can even hear the sounds of sizzling flesh after burning enemies with the flamethrower. If that sound doesn't draw you into the war, I'm not sure if anything will.In the end, Call of Duty: World at War is a bit of an odd duck. It combines the new, successful multiplayer system of Modern Warfare with the old, familiar setting of World War II. Though WWII games are a dime a dozen, Call of Duty is still at the top for a reason. The campaign is varied and exciting, and can be played with up to three friends. The multiplayer is deep and addictive, and the new Nazi Zombie mode is surprisingly entertaining. The only major obstacle to enjoying this game for some is probably the setting. If you're absolutely sick of World War II, then you might end up forcing yourself not to enjoy this game. However, if you're a fan of first person shooters in the least, then World at War will provide an enthralling experience.			"

												Call of Duty: World at War is by far one of the best FPS co-op games on steam. Why? Not only does it have an entertaining fast paced still active multiplayer and an extremely involved campaign, but World at War also comes with modding capabilities. Many WaW fans agree, one of the best parts of Call of Duty is its zombies! Within the zombie mode, modders and mappers have introduced custom zombies maps for you to download online. This way you aren't stuck playing the same 4 zombie maps. There are hundreds of custom maps featuring customized weapons, camos, perks, scenery, storylines, objectives, game modes, and much more! Would definitely recommend this game to any FPS zombie lover out there. A+ in my book!Download Custom Zombies Maps Here:

												I have a story to tell, might get nostalgic to some of you so sit down and grab a drink.Back in 2009, i was at my cousins house playing out in the yard, then his bigger brother left his room to go walking with the older cousins, leaving just me, my cousin(we'll call cathal) and my other cousin Aaron. Now we went in his room and found his Xbox 360 and a so we turned it on. The game inside, Call of Duty: World at War. We decided to play and when we got on, we choose multiplayer and played with the split screen mode ond choose one of my favourite maps, Castle. We would camp at the two main buildings snipping with the PTRS-41 and using the other pre-made classes. After we played for a few hours, his brother came back and we left to go back outside. I went home asking my dad if i can get this game call Call of duty. HE said sure. Ever since that day, my life was consumed by first person shooters. I got it for the Wii btw. Each day i would go onto My wii and play WAW. Then i got an Xbox 360 and Xbox live. THats when i met people from around Ireland or the UK (i live in Australia now). I would play Multiplayer for hours, Zombies for hours, replay that mission where istill will never figure out how to shot Amirch Hamsel with a pistol from that range like wtf. Tehn i got the MW series, Black ops which i loved just as much and Halo Games which came with the 360. Now, 7 years later, im 16. I play Counter Strike and other games on my 360. However, every so often, ill boot up WAW, MW, BO, to relive distant memories. Remembering all my friends who i would add to platy COD with, Friends who i miss so much, Friends who ill never talk to again. But in the end, Call of Duty is an old classic you boot up on a Saturday evening to play with friends, have a laugh to escape life drama. Ill miss the old days, Split Screening, The PPSH-41, The sense of the Japense charging with a BANZAI. The fall of that german soilder on top of the reighstag, the sense of sniping 7 soilders and a dog with 5 bullets. Ill miss COD back in the late 2000s and early 2010s. I love this game10/10 :')			"

I join and there are still people playing<< > I play a few games and I wonder if there zombies> You must go to Singleplayer/Co-op to play zombies> I see zombies in singleplayer but what about multiplayer zombies?>> In Co-Op, there a list of servers for Co-Op story and Zombies-- I didn't even have to install any patch or modify my game in any way--and I almost didn't buy the game.Negative reviewers, You lied to me.

												Welcome to my review for call of duty world at war.Overview:call of duty world at war is a great call of duty game and extremly fun. While everyone says its a copy and paste of cod 4 its a good one and i'm glad treyarch made a ww2 version of cod 4 because the ww2 cods were great. If your wondering where all the dlc is its included in the game and its a good price for the base game and all 4 map packs.Campaign:The campaign is really cool and it proves the struggle that the russians had during the germans rise to power. Its one of those games that are so gorey that it makes you grateful that you didnt have to go to war and it makes you apreciate the army's work, for example you shoot someone in the arm and it will fly off and blood will splatter everywhere, shoot someone in the head with a shotgun and the enemys head will fly off, shoot someone in the leg and both legs will fly off. The story is great, you play as 2 different characters in the campaign: Dimitri petrenko (russian) & private C miller, On the American side you play as private C miller and you escape torture and raid the japanese camp that you escape from and continue to fight the war. It leads you through a long war that will keep you going for ages. For example on mission 2 theres an easter egg that lets you have a ray gun and mission 3 you get a flamethrower and another badass american mission is when you play as a commander on a ww2 plane and you feel like your raining death (a bit like death from above from cod 4, as i said this is a ww2 version of cod 4).  The russian side where you play as dimitri is probably the best part of the campaign because it has the more badass missions. You start off by being in the middle of a massacre at a town square only to meet sergeant reznov who helps you avange the massacre. You continue the campaign trying to regain control of the reichstag (end 2 missions of the campaign) but through that journey you murder as many germans as you can, you even go to their homeland and murder them there. Theres also a russian mission where you drive a tank as means of transport. The ending of the Russian campaign (end of campaign acctually) is badass and im not going to spoil it, just youtube it or play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.Overall i think the campaign is great and worth the price inculded in the game, i rate is 8/10Multiplayer:I dont really play much of this, probably a quarter of my hours but i stopped playing because of how many hackers are in multiplayer. Just like cod 4 you have 5 create-a-class slots with a primary weapon and 1 attachment, a secondary weapon, an equipment slot, 3 perk slots and a vehicle slot (yes some maps you can drive a tank). There is a great gamemode called war where theres a flag you have to capture and the more kills you get the faster you can capture a flag, im not going into to much detail because thats pretty much all war is. The maps are surprisingly really fun and i really enjoy them.Overall i give the multiplayer 7/10 because of the hackers, if there wasnt hackers i would give 8/10Zombies:This is probably my most played part and it is because of custom zombies. Custom zombies is really fun and the people out there create some amazing maps maybe even better than treyarchs default map. I wouldn't suggest playing co-op zombies unless your playing with a friend because people will steal your window and you get people on the mic but if you play solo or with a friend you save yourself from the migraines. The 4 default zombies maps are included (nacht der toten, verruckt, shi no numa & der reise) and they has some really nice features (shame that only der reise has pack a punch). There are 4 perks in zombies to which is very obvious (quick revive, speedcola, juggernog and double tap). Quick revive is a self revive on solo which means when you down you can get back up but you only have 3 uses, juggernog increases your health from 2 hits to die to 4-5 hits to die, speedcola makes you reload double fast and double tap lets you shoot 2x as fast. The guns are good but not amazing unless you have the ray gun or unless your on der reise and can pack a punch (pack a punch gives you a cool camo and shooting sound and doubles, qtriples or quadruples your gun damage, not sure which).Overall i think zombies is the best part, I wouldn't mind paying £20 for the zombies on its own but I rate the zombies part 9.5/10.One last note: If anyone does buy the game or enjoyed the review please thumbs up as this is the first review I have spent very long on but if you do get the game please send me a friend request, I'm always looking for friends on zombies but anyways buy the game and I promise you will love it.Thanks for reading ;)			"

												I have a deep hatred of Call of Duty (for a wide array of reasons), but this game on the PC kind of passed my firewall.In terms of system requirements and gameplay fluency, I was beyond surprised with how well this game runs. I was running a full 60 FPS flawless, even on the higher-paced Zombies mod, which honestly is the only saving grace in Call of Duty.The singleplayer was pretty interesting, too; it was a cool campaign of WWII taking place on two fronts against two highly different enemies - the Japanese favor unconventional, barbaric and suicidal attacks which provide challenge for the close-quarters-oriented United States Marines, and Hitler's Angels go against the Soviets in a longer-ranged conflict.The weaponry feels so unique and abstract from other installments of this otherwise putrid franchise, though that primarily comes from the gore effects in this game. Watching enemies' limbs go flying off when I blast them off with a pump-action shotgun reminds me of many years ago when I played this game on the Xbox 360.So World at War provides an entertaining singleplayer, which also has the equivalent of Halo's ""skulls"" (difficulty and game modifiers that provide either more challenging or easier effects in the gameplay) and cooperative campaign gameplay (it did on the Xbox, at least; I'm almost positive it does on the PC), and the Zombies mode is at its strongest and purest roots. It's tragic when the series' (Zombies) origins are the best version of it.Oh, and it's World War II, not this futuristic Titanfall wannabe ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. (One of my many reasons for loathing CoD.)			"

												Call of Duty: World at War is the fifth game in the COD franchise, releasing in 2008 on PC, PS3, PS2, Wii and Xbox 360. The game was developed by Treyarch and published by Activision. This game is set in the World War II era where you play as various soldiers from United States and The Red Army.  Please note that this review is purely based on the single player aspect of World at War. The gameplay shares several features with the rest of the COD franchise up to this release. You spend the majority of the time with at least one other AI controlled squad member which guide you through levels and keeps you up to date with your current objective. You may only carry two weapons at any one time, whilst also having access to smoke grenades, Molotov’s and hand grenades. We have all of the standard FPS mechanics like crouching and prone positions. You recover health by staying out of line of fire of enemies, since there is no “health” packs throughout the game. You know when you are getting close to death as the edges of your screen glow red and your heartbeat increases. I personally think this is a nice feature rather than relying on a health bar, it adds to the immersion of the gameplay as the UI is very minimal. Since this game was released almost eight years ago, the graphics are certainly starting to show their age, with some really low res textures, but the environments are all still really nicely designed, animations on everything is stellar too. Character models are all high quality too. The game’s sound effects are brilliant too; you really feel like you are under heavy fire from enemies when you have surround sound on with a sub.  The fully voice acted characters are also very well done too. This is one of the few COD games which I had a few moments of difficulty throughout the campaign. Usually with COD games your AI partners are able to carry you through most levels with little interaction from you needed, however this game is different.  The tank missions are the ones I found to be the most difficult as you really need eyes in the back of your head in order to avoid taking damage from the hundreds of enemies that have you in their sights. I am not condemning the game for difficulty; it is really refreshing to see a COD game has the challenge in it. The more recent COD games have become a walk in the park so it was nice to see something different here. Whilst the game is linear, there are a few collectables to find throughout the single player campaign, there are 13 “death cards” to be found on every level which unlock cheat modes when playing in co-op. This again is a really cool feature and gives you some incentive to check every room, nook and cranny to find the collectables rather than a pointless achievement. The only negative point about this game for me is the game’s length. I realise I only played the single player so I am only getting half of the experience, but I would have liked to have seen at least five hour single player campaign mode. I managed to complete the game on a medium difficulty in just over three hours. You could replay the game to go back and find all of the collectables and you could also ramp up the difficulty, but given the linearity of the game I don’t see myself jumping into doing that anytime soon.  Looking at the Steam chart numbers, the multiplayer scene is really active still so if multiplayer is your jam you will find a match quite easily still. Technically I only had one issue, and that is with the graphics on some levels. It almost felt like my graphics card was dying as there was spewing graphics all over my screen at some point. It is hard to explain how they looked, but they were really off putting to the game and only happened every few levels. A simple re-load resolved the issue thankfully. Call of Duty: World at War is one of the best games in the COD franchise and one that still holds its own in the current generation of games. Due to the single player’s length, the price point on this game is quite high at £19,99. I would say that if you plan on getting into the multiplayer side of this game, you should pick it up for that price, however if you are only interested in the single player campaign mode, you would be better off waiting for it to go on sale, unfortunately reduction on COD games are very rare so you need to keep your eyes peeled for the deals! For anyone who has just skipped a head to my rating; I will repeat, this game was reviewed purely on the single player campaign; please bear that in mind with this rating.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												Let's be real, if you're buying this game today it's only for the zombies (and the very fun campaign!).Sure the multiplayer is still there but it's a giant f&#$fest which is only fun for a little bit before it get's old. The zombies mode, and more importantly, the modded zombies maps are what make this game. If you go on the Steam WaW forums you'll always manage to find people to play with if you don't already have friends to play it with. The custom made maps range from being absolutely horrifying to extremely comedic. There are probably hundreds if not thousands of maps online that you can download and play on (look up a tutorial on how to download them if you aren't sure). This leads to pretty much infinite entertainment. I'd definetly pick this game up, but if you're not sure, just look up modded WaW zombies videos on youtube and see if you like them!Btw I see people complaining that newer CoD games don't have co-op campaign but the reason they don't have it is obvious - the new campaigns are so bad it'd be a waste of time and money to implement co-op campaign since nobody would want to play it.

												Usually I try and avoid cod games like the plague but something about a WWII setting seemed like it could be interesting. After reading some reviews and watching some videos etc. I decided to get it and hell was it worth it. The campaign is short but a blast. You still are a badass but atleast you have to take cover  and I ended up dying a ton of times on regular difficulty. The mulitplayer has a surprisingly decent amount of players playing it and on the right servers you will always be able to find a game and boy is it fun. Zombies is also very fun and I would reccomend getting it with your friends for a real good time, because usually you'll have to wait awhile to find a zombie match. Just all together this game ( atleast the campaign, and dont get me started on how amazing the seige on berlin is ) actually feels like a war and is a really good FPS. I would definitely reccomend it to anyone that doesn't like future themed crummy games, or who is looking for a damn good FPS.			"

												Hmm... where to begin with this amazing game. This game is the best Call of Duty game there is, in my opinion this game even tops COD4. Let me explain why, the campaign is so much fun, Intresting and replayable because this campaign has so many great missions. Next the Multiplayer... To date the Multiplayer is amazing but nowadays there are a few Hackers who just ruin it, but its very little that I see them in a game and there are some Higher XP lobbies which will get you ranked up quickly if you are new to the game so you can get the good guns such as the MP-40, Thompson and My fav weapon in the game the Springfield plus the MP maps are just amazing and have been remade becuase they where just to great. And then there is zombies a gamemode that was nearly canceled (which would have been a massive mistake) the zombies maps are my favs out of the Treyarch games and are the most fun to play and with people making modded zombie maps the fun can keep going. But zombies is very very fun if you have not played a Cod Treyarch game then I reccomend this one first to see how amazing cod really was. Thanks for reading :)			"

												This is one of the good Call Of Duty games. Based on CoD4's IW3 engine, plus the modding capabilities, the community is developing the game's modding even fruther ahead. But the only things is - I can only see alot of custom zombie maps, speaking of Mods and custom content.Dear modders! If you're reading this review, please, make some cool multiplayer mods + some custom co-op campaign maps ^.^			"

Strongest point WaW has to offer is a flexible mod support which allows essentially changing a healthy amount of engine core mechanics.[✔]> 4 player co-op campaign> dedicated mod support > unlimited amount of custom zombie maps> tactical mp instead of rush clusterf*ck> 64 player server & drivable tanks> free CoD DLCs (wow)[✘]> bugs occur more often than not "

Introduction: Call of Duty World at War developed by Treyarch is now a beloved classic in the eye's of many Call of Duty enthusiasts and still incredibly sought after by PC gamers to this day. Overview: Developed by Treyarch Call of Duty World at War remains amongst the top of many PC Call of Duty fans wishlists and standard playlists years after release for many reasons. True to the series fluid arcade style FPS gameplay elements fueled by adrenaline and a constant gameplay flow. Call of Duty: World at War separates itself from the pack as the last true Call of Duty PC release. With graphics optimization unheard of in this day and age of COD console ports to a modding friendly PC release, whether it be it's first forray in into Treyarchs now trademark Zombie mode or a multitude of community driven content in all aspects of multiplayer. Call of Duty: World at War is seen as the last title in the series to be given the full PC treatment gamers grew used to and has sadly never returned. Fans of the series who have never experienced Call of Duty: World at War will be amazed at the amount of content available as a standard retail release. The PC Steam version of this title comes preloaded with the DLC preinstalled for $19.99 which, is why this title has never seen a price drop aside from activisions penchant for never letting their financial steely grip on price reductions slip through their fingers and benefit the consumer on the backend. I must reiterate this Call of Duty release simply doesn't need one. With all the content available in this iteration anyone considering a purchase will be more than pleased with their decision to opt in to the lesser known older brother of the Black Ops series.Graphics: 8.5Just as any other version of the generation 7 Call of Duty games this is also based on the 2007 Unreal engine which, means considering the amount of graphics optimization available Call of Duty: World at War in comparison to it's younger siblings still holds it's own in many aspects and more in some cases.     Gameplay: 8.0Although not quite as intricate as Infinity Wards fan favorite Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. World at War holds it's own where it matters.....Solid gameplay. This is a tried and true Call of Duty recipe since the originals release which I am happy to say is represented perfectly. Although a bit on the no frills side in comparison to Modern Warfare, some prefer it's tenacious gun battles and old school FPS precision beats killstreak style and should in the least be embraced by all ""New school"" Call of Duty fans. Sound: 8.5 A series staple. Call of Duty doesn't let down even by current generation 8 standards. Every whizzing bullet and explosion will test even the most high end of Dolby Surroud Sound systems subwoofers currently on the market today. When the settings are placed just right, you can close your eyes and imagine what an existance in this chaotic time in history would have been like. This truley helps set the tone in any true battlefield experience and World at War doesn't dissapoint.  Online experience: 9.0After all these years Call of Duty: World at War still has a thriving online vs. multiplayer community supplimented by a vast zombies experience that many consider to be superior to the franchises later releases. Due solely to the dedicated modding community that activision has sadly all but forgotten about in it's later releases. With that being said the multiplayer servers are also maintained by groups of dedicated FPS communities. One specific group that must be mentioned for it's servers integrity and organization is the [PDE] "" PerfectDarkElite"", this groups primary servers are maintained by some of the most friendly and integrity driven individuals that I can proudly say I have played along side for countless hours of intense online battles.    Story: 7.5The story of Call of Duty: World at War is what I would consider it's weakest point. Seeded in the standard World War II scenario, you won't find much originality here. Yet with that being said it still manages to keep your interest as any Call of Duty action fest should with the series standard over exaggerated explosions and barely made it through situations, World at War still has it moments of surprize and awe. Replay Value: 10With all the above mentioned features preinstalled in the retail release and available from the online community this is where Call of Duty: World at War shines above the rest!!! If your looking to make a Call of Duty purchase that will last into future if the past is any example then World at War is it! With a lower price tag than it's younger brothers, every dollar is a dollar well spent. The replay value of this title is endless. Final Review Score: 8.0There are two defining Call of Duty titles from the seventh generation that not only set the standard for all titles to come in the series but, also simply couldn't be matched in terms of gripping single player campaigns to this day Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and World at War. Without a doubt Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is the superior of the two but, regardless there's a reason that Treyarch continued to base multiple entries on the gameplay formula represented here....Simply put because it's good and they knew it. If you are looking for one of the best World War II campaigns in gaming history and an online experience that still bustles today, then look no farther.			"

												I bought this game for one reason only ... CUSTOM ZOMBIES!First off, you'll never get bored of zombies as there are so much maps to pick from (there are websites with hundreds of maps).. literally it's endless.If you can get a few friends to buy it too and get all the same maps, it is just endless hours of fun. However i didn't think much of the multiplayer side of this game as i expected it to be like the console - full of hackers and no one playing. Wow I was wrong! I went in to expect no one online. Pressed refresh and hunders of severs and I had the option to filter it and only show servers that aren't modded. I even saw a few servers full of 40+ people playing! (Yep! 40+ people playing in the one match of TDM and on the tiny maps-- IT'S JUST CHAOS in a good way).Seriously, buy this game for Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies! Worth all of your money and all of your hours! Really fun and addictive. This is the game where Call of Duty was at it's best and if it wants to return to that, just remaster this f***ing game!A MUST BUY! <3			"

PROS:+ 2 different WW2 fronts+ variety of weapons and scenarios+ co-op campaign+ zombie modes+ mod support+ still strong playerbaseCONS:- occasional graphical bugs & glitches- AI issues in certain places- some problems with connecting to other players- meeting hackersComment:This game is fantastic. No need to build up tension when a game this good is reviewed. By no means is it a perfect game but surely a very good WW2 FPS worth taking a look at. People who love WW2 shooters and war stories will get their fair share of epic scenes and combat. The variety is what shines, the fact that the missions don't get repetitive. This is thanks to 2 main campaign paths, one in the Pacific and the other in Europe (east front). Yes, we have seen some scenarios in previous CoD or MoH games. But it matters little because it takes a different take on these which keeps it fresh. It has some flaws, like AI being weird in a couple of places, or the occasional glitch. But overall the campaign is great and what makes it even better is the co-op option. That being said it is not always easy to connect to your friends. Same can be said for multiplayer in general but even though the game is old the playerbase remains quite steady. This might be partially because this is (so far) the last WW2 CoD game and mod support was still a thing here. To top off the posibilities this is the first time we get zombie modes in CoD. And it's glorious, especially custom zombies. Playing these modes with friends is loads of fun! I recommend this game and I advise you to get some mods after you finish with the base experience.P.S.: ignore the play time, I played a ton of this back in the day but I don't own a CD/DVD drive anymore so I bought it again on Steam to try it out			"

												Once upon a time, there was a Call of Duty game that, much like the others, recieved hate for being part of the CoD francise. However, it had many great things that people consider groundbreaking in newer CoDs such as gore and interactive map elements (in the form of tanks). Once upon a time, that game wasn't infested by hackers in multplayer. That game was Call of Duty World at War. A fantastic WW2 game that was on par with Brothers in Arms for showing how dark WW2 (or any war for that matter) was/can be. We had access to many weapons of devestation, from M1A1 Bazookas, to M2-2 Flamethrowers, and other feared weapons such as the MG42, or as many soldiers dubbed it, ""Hitler's Buzzsaw."" Explosives and large calibre ammunition showed their true power when they ripped apart characters limb by limb, the flamethrower engulfed and charred the bodies of soldiers in true awe. But the experience doesn't just end with a heroic end to a dark and gritty campaign and 80+levels of multiplayer, oh no, for an extra, small map had made it into the game; Nacht der Untoten, Night of the Living Dead. In a move that caught everyone, even many of the employees at Treyarch, offguard, an extra mode was added into Call of Duty that would be immortalized as a icon of the series. Nazi Zombies. Many players, myself included, spent countless hours having fun with this little surprise. And it didn't end there; more maps were added, and all Treyarch games since have had it included, as if the modding community wasn't putting out enough maps as it was. But its time was cut short when Modern Warfare 2 came out the next year and as the fanbase moved on, the hackers moved in, polluting the public multiplayer lobbies like a cancer, making people less inclined to play the game. And so ends the story of Call of Duty World at War... or does it? No, the game won't die for a long time because of its dedicated custom map making community, creating more and more great Zombies experiences each day.			"

												Not much of a Call of Duty fan, but WaW is too good to pass. One of the first games I ever played. First time I played was on the Wii, then switched to PS3, now PC, and it's so much better and fun on the PC. WaW is the only Cod I'll actually play day in and day out. This was and still is a masterpiece.			"

												One of the few Call of Duty games ACTUALLY WORTH YOUR MONEY AND TIME. World at War is quite possibly the best COD of all time. It takes place in the second Wolrd War and lets you play as not only the American marines fighting in Japan, but the Soviets fighting in Germany. From what I've seen, people still play multiplayer. You also get the 3 zombie map dlcs with this purchase so that is a plus. If you enjoy shooters and are a history lover, this game is perfect.			"

Arguably the best of the franchise and well populated. Brilliantly nostalgic and still an absolute joy to play. PunkBuster can be a problem however.""Call of Duty"" was and remains a franchise at the forefront of the online FPS genre. Dominating both console and PC alike, it's rivaled some would say, only by it's EA counterpart ""Battlefield""; but ""World at War"" was something else.Released in 2008 it adapted and built perfectly on the foundations set the previous year by Activision's installment in the series - ""Modern Warfare"".Trearch's addition gave us features the likes of which we'd never seen in ""Call of Duty 4"". Vehicles. Tanks. Though on face value a simple addtion, their inclusion was well implimented and appropriatley balanced. We were also graced with a slightly new approach to the killstreak system, seeing the introduction of attack dogs; along with a tweaked 'Create-A-Class' system made to feel more period accurate, with bolt action rifles becoming an entierly different weapon type paired with the ability to use their iron-sights, as apposed to being restricted to a telescopic sight.In terms of singleplayer, this installment saw you brave the horrors of WWII from both a Russian and American perspective; battling the Japanesse on Iwo Jima and beating down the 3rd Reich from Stalingrad to Berlin. Featuring the voice talents of Keifer Sutherland for the American Sgt. Roebuck, and Gary Oldman for the premier of the legendary hard-as-nails Russian sniper - Viktor Reznov. The campaign is both compelling and fantasicaly written with mixes of close and ranged combat along a spectrum of locales beautifully designed and planned. The singleplayer is, as far as im concerned, unsurpassable by any other ""Call of Duty"" game. However, my one biggest fault with ""Call of Duty: World at War"" is the unfortunate lack of PunkBuster support. The anti-cheat system which now seems abandoned and disused is still required to play some servers in online matchmaking. Needing some Google searching to find a download of the appropriate files to enable the system to work. Although once this is done, the game plays fine and without further fault.Oh, and not to mention. Zombies.Recommended?: Yes.Score: 9/10			"

												Playing this f#cking game made me notice how much I miss the old WW2 FPS games, instead of the new futuristic crap wars that this franchise keeps making up to keep milking blind fans. The thing is, every time I tried to finish this game something happens and I couldn't finish it. Well, until now, that is. Is this game worth it or not? As usual, I'm gonna explain the bad things it has first, although being honest there's not much wrong with it.First and foremost, the story is split in two different parts of WW2, the Americans trying to get revenge after the Pearl Harbor mess and Russia kicking some nazi ♥♥♥. And personally, the American part of the game needed some work. The characters are just SO DAMN BLAND, EVEN FOR COD STANDARDS. And it even tries to pull the ""suddenly killing an important character infront of you and you can't do anything about it"" multiple times, and it fails to get anything because neither I know ANYTHING about those character, neither I even CARE about them. It just means I'll have a different American dumb#ss yelling at me every 10 seconds.Going further with the American side of the story, while they offer some nice changes from the rest of the series, they repeat itself a bit too much. Seriously, most of the American part of the game is spent crawling in trenches and holes in the ground. One of it's missions has one of the moments I most liked on the game, the whole level on the plane using all of those cool guns and it just makes me wonder WHY AREN'T THERE MORE OF THOSE AND LESS DAMN HOLES IN THE GROUND.Also, the game is kinda short. Now sure, CoD games always have a short story mode but hell, in Modern Warfare titles they make up a dumb story behind all of the pew pew pew democracy MURRICA, here they didn't really need to think of a story as it wrote itself years ago. It lasts around 4 to 5 hours, but will take you more on high difficulties. It ends with a good taste, but it's a bit needlessly short to my refined-afro-fueled taste.Lastly, it has some gameplay issues, similar to what you would expect from the rest of this damn ♥♥♥♥♥d franchise. Corpses freezing in mid-air, enemies doing nothing but spamming grenades on high difficulties, enemies respawining non-stop and even respawning in between your allies in insane places, that sort of stuff. Seriously, don't even bother to use normal grenades in anything that isn't normal or easy difficulty, most times enemies will just pick them up and throw them back at your face. Thank motherf#cking mother Russia the Soviet story has molotovs.All of that being said, what does the game have to offer? Well, if you're played games such as the three original CoD's or Medal of Honor (before it went Modern Warfare Ripoff mode) then you'll know what to expect.The story, while being a bit bland on the American side, is quite engaging and fun to go through. Specially the Russian side of it, which feels like it was done by completely different people, as......Well, the Russian side it's just SO F#CKING GOOD. AMAZING MUSIC, AMAZING LEVELS, AMAZING CHARACTERS AND ACTION, JUST WHY COULDN'T THE GAME BE ALL WITH THEM!? I'M NOT JOKING.Weapons are also great. You know this sh#t feeling you get in pretty much all CoD games that any weapon which isn't a Sniper Rifle or an Assault weapon is trash? Well, while Shotguns still seem to be irrelevant on this game, you'll be surprised to find that pretty much all weapons are useful. I actually do suggest switching and trying them all to find what suits your style more. Also, the American vs Japan and Russia vs Nazis stories have different weapons completely, which is a good effort.Something that also surprised me were the vehicle sections. Both stories have a level in which you're in somewhat control of a vehicle, the Americans being the multiple turrets of a big-#ss plane and the Russians being a damn vodka-fueled tank of atomic destruction. Both of them were actually quite fun, specially the plane one.The game also has Coop, although I couldn't try it out this time. I bet it's fun, but I wanted to try it out by myself anyway. The Coop that I did try is the Nazi Zombies mode a long time ago on the Xbox360 of a friend, and that sh#t is fun as hell.Is the game worth it, then? Well, the problem is mainly the price. For 20€ I don't think it is. For that price, either wait for a sale that drops it to 5€ or lower, or just buy it on console, however I DO recommend playing it. It's fun, and a good throwback to the classic CoD's.TL;DR Edition: Think of Modern Warfare 1 but with Vietnam flashes and the Soviet Union suplexing Nazis. It's fun as hell, specially the Coop with the Nazi Zombies unlockable mode, but 20€ is a bit way too much.			"

												Campaign:This is by far my favorite campaign in Call of Duty. The grim, brutal and graphic nature of the campaign really makes the game feel like World War 2, the deadliest war of all time.You play as the Soviets against Nazi Germany in one campaign. You witness the beginning of the war with a grim scene of death and an enticing sniper battle. You then find yourself breaking into the heart of Germany and the destruction of the Fatherland. You also get to prove yourself as either an emotionless monster or a forgiving soul.You also play as the American's against the Japanese. You will witness the Japanese banzai tactics and guerilla warfare. You will go from hot, dry out in the open fighting to narrow caves and muddy, rainy hills. You will witness the downfall of the Japanese Empire from start to finish. Both campaigns are very enticing and the missions, although action packed, are memorable and the environment/scenes make it seem realistic.Multiplayer:The multiplayer is fun, although sadly their is no matchmaking for PC like their is on console. You have to search through the list of servers. A lot are crouch servers/tactical servers which can be a +1 or a -1. I'm personally fine with it. Game also comes with all DLC's so you get all the maps.Zombies:Yes, zombies. The masterpiece of World at War. It all started here. You get all the zombie maps, plus there is hundreds of custom zombies maps that make the zombies experience endless. This is a big highlight of the PC version. You can easily play with your friends. You can do cheats as well. I'd say the zombies is the best reason to get the PC version over the console versions.Graphics:Pretty nice for their time. I wouldn't criticize it since the rest of the game makes up for it.Overall 9.5/10I take 0.5 off for the lack of matchmaking. Otherwise I love WAW and have played it on my friends accounts and have spent atleast 100 hrs on the PS3 version.			"

												Call of Duty: World at War. The last game before all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC ports of the Call of Duty series. World at War (WaW) is the fifth iteration in the arcade shooter series that brings WWII elements in the COD universe. WAW is Made by Treyarch a company that has made titles such as ""Call of Duty: 2"" and ""Call of duty: 3"", so if you have played those you're in for a similar experience just much more shiny. The COD series also has another developer (Infinity Ward) that switches off on each of the series's games. WAW brings a whole new part of the series. A 4-Player cooperative game-mode named ""Nazi Zombies"". The new experience compiles intuitive gameplay like finding the best parts of a level to kill the undead or find out what weapons do the most damage.The campaign is 5-8 hours of Shooting mindless enemies on set pieces arranging from the heart of Russia to Nazi trenches. The multiplayer is class based with a perk system and customizable weapons. If you manage to get a certain amount of kills in a row you earn special kill-streaks. 3 kills is a UAV, 5 kills is an Artillery Strike, and 8 kills in a row you call in dogs to rip your enemies apart. Overall Call of Duty: World at War is a great buy if you like shooting up hordes of zombies all night with your friends. Or if you want to have a good time killing your way to the top in the leaderboards on multiplayer. Either way your going to have a good time with this game.			"

												After purchasing a gaming computer, this was one of the first games I downloaded. THE best purchase I have made on Steam. When World at War first came out, I only had an Xbox. I'd watch videos on YouTube of custom made zombie maps and I would weep silently as I was restricted to the stock & DLC maps (which are still AMAZING). Call of Duty: World at War for PC gaming is everything I thought it would be and so much more.Pros:- Multiplayer is still popular, I'm normally playing in a server with between 14-40 people.- Nazi Zombies, with hundreds of custom player made maps. - Has 10 Prestiges (unlike CoD: 4) I find love that they added this for WaW. Through Prestiging, you can unlock 5 additional Custom Classes, for a total of 10 Customizable Classes.- Singleplayer is incredibly fun and well done. I'm a sucker for WW2 games, so I admit that I am biased.- Explosions and certain weapons will dismember enemies.Cons:- If you aren't with friends, or you haven't gone onto an online community to play Nazi Zombies/Custom NZ, you will more than likely not be able to find a game with a decent ping, which restricts you to SP Nazi Zombies. You can use cheats to help you out, if need be.- Still has a few bugs here and there. The map Downfall occasionally crashes my game, and I will occasionally get kicked from servers upon loading new maps.- Depending on the server, there will be hackers/try hards/cry babies/trolls. Enable Punkbuster and you should be okay (for hackers). I also tend to frequent the same 2 servers, which are usually monitored with an admin, and has a clan website where players can upload demos of suspected hackers.- I find 20$ to be excessive for an 8 year old game (call me cheap idk), so I waited for it to go on sale and grabbed it for 10$All in all, I have to give this a 9/10. The ability to play on customized zombie maps/mods allows you to spend hours trying out new maps or mods. I've been playing the Zombie Realism mod, which adds in a ranking system, custom classes, Prestige mode, weapon Challenges, and more. There aren't many 8 year old games that I can still have fun playing, but World at War is definitely one of them. "

												I think World at War is definitely one of the best Call of Duty games, ever! It has an intense understanding of warfare thus unlike any other FPS it gives the players more than a regular opportunity just to match a crosshair with the enemy in front of you. Rather you feel a whole battlefield with a realistic weaponry. Campaign is especially good considering that it tells the story of fronts that has been mentioned less so far, than the other fronts of WWII. It is not very difficult to play, like most of the CoD games, however Veteran difficulty could be tried for a fun challange. Also, you have the opportunity to play in competitive Co-op mode up to 4 players . Other than that there is of course the zombie mode which is the very beginning of the whole series. Map numbers are limited and so are the possibilities but I think it is a must for every dedicated player. Multiplayer is realistic and although perks, attachments and weapons are of great use and advantage for a player, higher levels of others is not a crucial concern for a beginner. The game depends on the talent and caution of a player mostly as well as gameplay experience but not definitely on their level.In overall, I can say that this game is a must for a CoD player, a nice and slighlty different experience for an FPS player and a good place to start for the inexperienced action gamers.

												In my opinion, this is a nearly perfect game. It has an ok story, but you will overlook that very quickly as the gameplay and atmosphere captures the horror of World War 2 flawlessly, in both plot lines. In the first plot line, you play as an American soldier battling the Japanese, trying to capture an island that is full of booby traps and relentless enemies. This is a very cool way to play, with close quarters combat and ambushes aplenty, making the gameplay very suspenseful. In the other plotline, you play as a Russian soldier, firstly trying desperately to survive during a massive German invasion of a Russian town, then four years later, in 1945, you enter Germany and Berlin and brutally crush the German empire in what is a very satisfying set of levels. The first mission where you play as the Russian soldier is absolutely groundbreaking, filled with suspense and a dark, powerful atmosphere as you try to escape from the overkill that are the Nazis. Gameplay is your average Call of Duty game, it's fun and addictive, but on harder difficulty modes, it is extremely frustrating. Even on the easiest difficulty, you can bet that enemies will throw 3 grenades all aimed at you with no time to react. The Campaign is very entertaining and while short it has plenty of powerful moments, ESPECIALLY the ending, that was one of the best moments in a game, ever. The game looks absolutely beautiful, for a person that has to run PayDay 2 on lowest settings windowed to get 30 FPS it looks fantastic, even on lowest settings. The music is stunning, even right when you start the game you hear a track that grabs you into the game. Sadly, Campaign Co-op is dead and no-one plays it, so be sure to get friends if you want to play the Campaign with someone. Multiplayer is very good. On the XBox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game, it is notorious for everyone to hack and spoil the game. Oddly, on the PC version, where it is far easier to cheat, you barely see any cheaters. In general, Multiplayer is very well alive and still has a lot of players to this very day, which is good, because multiplayer is very entertaining and amusing to playthrough online. Last, but certainly not least, the arcade-style Nazi Zombies mode. This is one of the best modes ever to be added to a video game, and would you believe it was added last minute? While the Zombies mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops is flawless and (for some extra money) contains all the WaW maps remastered, it's still incredibly fun, and if you ask a friend to play Zombies with you, they usually accept. Overall, this is an excellent game and one that should definitely be in your Steam library. Just, don't get it full price, for this old of a game paying £20 is just plain stupid.			"

												It may be a re-skin of CoD4 but that just means the Good War is back and it's better than ever.Despite the grumblings of many, World at War shows there is still a lot of fight left in WWII as a setting. And despite some obvious shortcomings, like the broken audio and straightforward story, World at War is every bit as intense, polished and fun as it's predecessor. The presentation is top notch, with cutscenes that mix real wartime footage with sleek, modern graphics. The short single player campaign is helped by a terrific multiplayer and co-op portion as well as the ever fun Nazi mode. The World at War doesn't reinvent the wheel by staying snugly in Modern Warfare's shadow, but it does make for a thrilling and enjoyable ride that fans of WWII and shooters alike are sure to appreciate.

												Before you criticize my review based on my playtime shown above, I have played this game an absolute ♥♥♥♥ ton on console.With that being said...Campaign: It's fun if you're into it.Multiplayer: Haven't touched it though I assume it's dead.Zombies: The reason you should get this game. All the DLC is included free of charge so you don't have to mess with paying more for zombie maps. Also, there are tons of custom zombie maps that people have made so you will pretty much never get bored of zombies. The game is incredibly user friendly when loading up custom zombie maps from online so you don't have to install any bull sh*t mods or program to use them. Also, while there are some mediocre zombie maps, there are also a ton of well designed maps that in some cases due to easter eggs or new features outshine the ones that the game comes with. To add, because zombies on Black Ops 1 and 2 aren't exactly mod friendly, custom map makers have turned to integrating a lot of BO1 and BO2 zombies features in World at War. From guns to perks like Mule Kick and extra pack a punch features like cool looking skins for guns when you pack a punch it, these custom maps become more than just a room with spawn points. Hell, there's even buyable endings where you can literally beat the map after you rack up enough points depending on what it's set at (do not confuse buyable with actually having to buy and ending with real money, it's all using the in game points so don't worry about having to pay for extra sh*t. Though this may seem like a lot, or a little if you're a skeptic, this is just a surface level review of what there is to offer in this game through custom zombie maps. You do not have to pay for any map that you download (that I know of) and there's plenty of ways to get these maps. Personally, I just go to youtube and watch well known zombie players playing custom maps that they think are cool and conveniently they link the download to the map. Pretty trusted resource cause, you know, the internet would never lie to me. Anyways, here's a TL;DRGet this game mainly for zombies. All DLC included and custom maps are easily available and easy to use. IMO the custom maps are better than the original ones. Worth.10/10			"

Call of Duty: World at War is a first person shooter created by Treyarch for PC and consoles. Originally named ""Call of Duty 5"", the game continues, and subsequently finishes, the World War II setting started from the first game, ""Call of Duty"". It is the first game within the ""Call of Duty: Black Ops"" series, although not branded/labeled as a ""Black Ops"" game itself. It is considered the goriest, most emotionally hard hitting, and realistic Call of Duty video game to date.Call of Duty: World at War is a fictional video game depicting the fictional lives of two Privates during the denouement of World War II. The game starts with an American Army soldier named Private C. Miller and his journey throughout the beaches and lands of Japan, marching and fighting his way through Makin, Okanawa, and Peleliu Island with Sergeant Thomas Sullivan (who is murdered by a Japanese soldier early in the campaign), who is later replaced by Sergeant Roebuck. After the American-sided introduction, the game then switches to Soviet Union Red Army soldier Private Dimitri Petrenko, and his journey with Sergeant Reznov, Private Chernov, and the rest of the Red Army as they charge their way throughout Stalingrad in Russia, to the fields of Seelow in Germany, and subsequently to Berlin as they cut down all in their path, fighting and brutally slaughtering their way into the Reichstag, to slice down the facist Reich's flag, and to wave ultimate victory over Germany for Mother Russia.Campaign================================The game starts with the American campaign, with Pvt. Miller, along with Sgt. Roebuck and Sullivan, charging through Makin with their battalions, falling into ambushes, and blowing up an ammo depot. The game, after 3 American based missions, switches to the Russian side of the campaign. The Russian campaign starts with the player, Pvt. Petrenko, lying in the slaughter of his comrades after a massacre at a fountain at the Red Square in Stalingrad. The player then continues with Sgt. Reznov to assassinate a German General named Amsel, to avenge the fallen soldiers who had died at Stalingrad. Afterwards, they escape Stalingrad and begin their own adventure to take back Russia, and later Berlin.The game continues with multiple battles and conflicts, which when paired with Sean Murray's amazing music, make the whole experience very emotionally hard hitting, and unforgettable. To the Russian Battle Theme, and the ""Black Cats"" fighting theme, the game deliveres an amazing experience that reminisces of the golden days of Call of Duty video games.Zombies================================Call of Duty: World at War intruduces a new ""Nazi Zombies"" mode into the franchise. The mode centers around an operative (or a group of operatives) as they are stranded at a certain base, in need of rescue, from a pending Nazi Zombie invasion. The group/player must work together/alone to fight their way through the carnage and to escape the compound they are in, being supplied with multiple weapons, and powerups through the way.This mode is definitely worth a try, and a good move on Treyarch.Multiplayer================================With the singleplayer campaign, the game also presents a co-op mode, which allows you to play the campaign with friends. It enables the new ""DeathCards"" cheats, which reveal special cheats as you collect them throughout the campaign. They're mostly jokes, such as the cheat that replaces all your weapons with stones. I ♥♥♥♥ you not.While the true multiplayer is broken, it can be fixed by following the PC Gaming wiki article here[pcgamingwiki.com].Upon fixing the multiplayer, most players will notice that almost all the servers are sadly modded. Most servers have leveling cheats enabled, where-in your first 5 minutes of gameplay the player will most likely already be leveled to level 28. I have suffered this, and many others have/will too.Ignoring that, the multiplayer is mostly fun. There's multiple modes that will deliver a fun arcade experience for the player. Nothing much to say here.Issues/Bugs/Glitches================================Albeit all the great things about the game, it does present multiple issues. For starters, the game has a failsafe where if the player does not advance at all, it will start spamming grenades at the player until they move forward. On most difficulties, this is usually 1 to 3 grenades. While this doesn't sound too bad, it becomes a terrible experience on Veteran difficulties, as the player will most likely have 6-7, even 8 grenades thrown at them at once.The game also suffers from terrible AI issues. An example is in ""Vendetta"", the first Russian campaign mission. During the part where you must protect your comrades as they storm a communications center, sometimes of the AI will become confused, and refuse to navigate. This results in a crash, which you must ALT+TAB out to see (as the game does not close automatically). Sadly, this has happened to me at least 4 times throughout the campaign, with both American and Russian campaigns. The AI can also be oblivious to enemies, where they (sometimes) will stand their and absorb bullets until they die, doing nothing. This is most prominant on Veteran mode, and leads to an annoying experience, since your comrades will not help you AT ALL during these fire-fights. Happily, Sgt. Roebuck nor Reznov will never have these errors; as Reznov stays in the back (never moving unless it's a scripted event), and Roebuck stays behind cover all of the time throwing grenades and using his pistol.  The enemies also feel like they all have aimbot on higher difficulties, and aren't actually aiming for the armies as a whole; just you and you alone.Final Remarks================================I definitely recommend this game to EVERYONE who has a love for first person shooters, war video games, or Call of Duty games, as this game will find a way to take camp in anyones heart and mind.This game is simply amazing, despite the issues it has, and definitely deserves a chance to be played by everyone.================================FINAL RATING: 8/10			"

												This is in my opinion, the best call of duty every made. nearly 7 years later and it is still the game that I find myself going back to. Treyarch did a phenomical job, and the WW2 era is something that I sorely miss in today's games. Not to mention that this introduced the world famous zombie modes. Some of the free zombie mods are worlds better than what you can get as paid dlc, or even full games from other sources or consoles. They really outdid themselves with this game. Heres to hoping for a W@W 2 this fall!			"

												TL;DR - Overall, I'd say that this is one of the best games in the CoD franchise, with one of the best campaigns and a very enjoyable multiplayer. If you like the CoD franchise, old or new, you'll enjoy the hell out of this.Full Thoughts (Mainly Campaign Stuff)------------------------------------------Campaign - The campaign in CoD: WaW is refined and fun to play, with a few dragging stages in between. The beginning mission (Semper Fi) places you as a man known only as 'Miller' in a Japanese POW camp. This is an appropriate start to WaW, with the player witnessing the brutal and often horrifying depictions of war that this game brings to the table. Now, from this mission onwards, here is my complaint: All of the Pacific Front (American/ Japanese) missions (Excepting the first) are considerably worse than the Soviet ones. There are many cliche and boring moments in the Pacific Front's story overall, and the levels are bland and repetitive. Often, your goal is doing one thing over and over again until suddenly your commander says ""I think we've done enough for today."". For instance, you'll be assaulting mortar pits repeatedly many a time as Miller, with the gameplay being moderately frustrating on Normal difficulty, but teeth-gratingly frustrating on Veteran. You'll often see that Japanese soldiers have no qualms about tossing grenades precisely at your position until the sun goes down. You'll have to relocate often enough for it to become more of a difficult chore than an action-packed, life-threatening stunt. The Soviet (Eastern Front, whatever you wanna call it) missions are the highlights of the campaign. Don't get me wrong, the Pacific Front has its jaw-dropping moments, but they are few and far between compared to the Soviet campaign. Pvt. Petrenko is your character, with the first mission starting directly after a massacre of Red Army soldiers by the Wermacht. This is also where you meet Reznov, your campaign-long companion with a taste for brutality. This mission (Vendetta) has you stalking the ruined buildings and streets of Stalingrad, recreating the confusion and vulnerability displayed in the soldiers who fought through that siege. This mission does most things flawlessly, having all of the brutality, action, story, and gameplay that CoD: WaW promises. You duel with a sniper, duck under flamethrowers, and kill scores of Wermacht scum (Getting into character a bit), all while being inspired to push forward by the great performance put forward by Gary Oldman (Reznov). The voice-acting in the Soviet stages is superior to the Pacific stages, the gameplay is superior, the environments are far superior, and the Red Army Soldiers are too! URRRAAA!!! Ahem... So, if you're looking for a good campaign, just tough it through the Pacific levels and you'll have one of the best of the franchise.			"

												I played the game for over 2000 hours on ps3 and over 500 hours on xbox 360. This is the best cod man has ever made. Singleplayer is epic from the begining of being captured and tortured, to putting that rusian flag up. Best cod campaign 10/10. Next is Zombies. TBH im not a zombies fan however, this has teh best maps for zombies and is just cool. WIth custom maps aswell that just makes my 7/10 go to a 9/10. wont give 10/10 until i like zombies ;) Last is MP. same engine as cod4 in ww2. What is there to hate, fine there not many good servers as they are all 64 man XD. I want a classic 5v5 / 6v6 game to be perfect. there are extra xp / easy prestige servers if you cba to grind and tbh i dont see why you wouldnt use those servers. People say there are hackers but i have seen1 hacker who tried to aimbot but his aimbot missed everytime XD. i would buy this game for the price it is now!!!			"

												I know I've only played this game for two hours on PC, but I already know what this game is all about from playing both the PS3 and 360 versions of it for years. After experiencing all the annoying ♥♥♥♥ that's plagued the console versions of WaW, the PC version was a refreshing change from all the god mode, no clip, infection, infinite ammo, XP hacking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on consoles. Another major bonus of WaW on PC is custom zombies which, after being able to play as a shotgun wielding Patrick Star shooting up dozens of Bubble Buddy zombies, further solidified my love for WaW on PC. All in all, if you're a console gamer looking to escape the mess that is WaW on consoles, get yourself a decent PC, buy this game (preferably when it's on sale because $9.99 is a hell of a lot better than paying $19.99 for an almost eight year old game), and enjoy WaW before it went to ♥♥♥♥ on consoles. Oh, one word of advice for console gamers wanting to play this version of WaW, the mouse and keyboard makes it easier to aim in this game so don't be surprised when you get sniped dozens of times out of nowhere immediately after you spawn. 10/10 would pop hundreds of bubble buddies with a shotgun and get sniped out of nowhere immediately after spawning again.

												I bought this game during the winter sale, and can't put it down! I played this game originally on the Xbox 360, and wanted to have it on my steam Library. Little did I know I wouldn't have to pay for DLC, and I could Mod the game. Now i've sunk 18 hours into zombies alone, havn't started the campaign, or started up Multiplayer.			"

												*EDIT* This is one of the last good Call of Duty games in my opinion. The Black Ops series was well put together also, and Advanced Warfare turned out to be good so far. But I always come back to this CoD, because of how simple it is, and the amount of people that still play this game after 6 Years of it's release. I love this game, because of the campaign and most of all the zombies. Considering that they have a lot of custom maps, it just makes this game worth playing anytime. I recommend this game to anyone who loves to play Call of Duty and the Zombies mode itself.			"

												To this day, Call of Duty: World at War still holds up as one of the greatest first person shooters of all time. To give a full perspective on the game, I will do this review in three parts:Campaign: Probably the weakest aspect of the game, but still fun to run around play through World War II environments. Its story feels a bit less personal and epic as some of the other titles (Modern Warfare, Black Ops), however it isn't by any means bad and can still be enjoyed. The mechanics of the campaign can be somewhat odd, with things like random grenade spawning which cause a bit of annoyance. But, on the whole it's still a fun time. World at War also has a co-op campaign feature, something that has not been seen since in the series.Multiplayer: This is where World at War really shines. In general, the game is designed around being skill based, and as such you are rewarded for being a good player. Now, that doesn't mean there isn't the occasional iffy mechanic in the game (martyrdom), however most of the time you earn your kills and deserve your deaths. The TTK (time to kill) is higher than other games, making gun accurasy and controlling recoil key. The game has generally very strong maps (Castle, Cliffside, Downfall, Nightfire etc.), and each map generally accomidates to a variety of skill sets and has a variety of sightlines (again, reinforcing good aim and gun control being rewarded). All in all, this game has a near perfect multiplayer and to this day remains a great experience. Bonus - Zombies: Although Zombies has come to be expected out of modern Treyarch Call of Duty titles, in World at War it was a hidden bonus mode that caught on like wildfire. That's right, World at War is where this whole zombies craze started. There are 4 zombies maps in total (although you can download additional countless ones via user created maps), including my personal favorite map Zombies map ever, Der Riese. However, every map is enjoyable. The biggest weakness in World at War's Zombies is the zombie grab, which can often cause frustration and being automatically down with no chance to get away. However, if you're good enough, you can avoid this for the most part. Although future games are more refined (and brought these maps back), World at War Zombies is still an incredibly enjoyable experience, and has an endless amount of mod content. Extra and Closing Thoughts: As I mentioned in the Zombies section, there is a wealth of moddable content for this game. This includes maps, guns, skins, modes etc., essentially creating a game you can spend an infinite amount of time and never be bored. In addition, PC players got ALL of World at War's DLC Content for free! However, it is worth noting that the community [as of mid 2014, 5.5 years after release] is slowly dying out, and you could eventually run into an issue finding a desireable game. That being said, this is an excellent game, one of my personal favorite FPS games of all time, and I highly recommend picking it up!			"

												Call of Duty World at War is a classic World War 2 First Person Shooter. Infact it is one of the better ones. In the Singleplayer Campaign you switch between two fronts: The Japanese-American and the Russian-German Front. Both Stories are alright, but the Russian one has way more Character Development than the American One. The Multiplayer is your Basic Call of Duty Multiplayer, but with (of course) WW2 Guns. The Multiplayer has small, but also some Bigger Maps. On some Big Maps you can even use Tanks to destroy your Enemies. After beating the Capmpaign you unlock the Zombie Mode ""Nazi Zombies"", which is the best thing about this game. Fight the undead horde round by round as long as possible. Arms yourself up with guns and perks and slay em all >:3. This game also supports mods. There are many mods for this game which add more zombie-Maps to play on. The modding Community is still active. If you like WW2 and Zombies CoD WaW is the game for you.			"

												Everybody buys this game for zombies, which is amazing, but I think that the rest of the game was and is highly underrated. The story mode is rich and exciting. Multiplayer is still very good to play on. I've had little to no trouble finding games and the servers have very few if any cheaters on them. Because it is a call of duty it uses the same gameplay mechanics that the most current one uses so to this day it still feels like a modern shooter. I would highly recommend this game... but wait for it to be on sale because it is not worth $20.			"

												An old but still effective FPS with a dramatic campaign that actually isn't an easy, half-♥♥♥♥♥ movie like later CoD games. This game was probably the last reputable CoD that came out, taking place during World War II and utilizing great graphics for its day (stll looks decent now).  You will feel like a Soviet hero under Sgt.Reznov's paternalistic nationalism and hatred for Nazis, and you will sense the vulnerability of being ambushed as well as the intense blood letting throughout the Pacific theatre of the campaign. Unique and badass missions permeate this game, and I would have to argue it has the best ending of ANY Call of Duty game!Also, the nazi zombies mini game they added is a timless classic, and a must-play with friends on coop mode!

												Do you have friends? Of course you do, everyone has friends. Get 3 of your friends to buy this game and play co-op with you. The campaign is identical over co-op as single player, and its fun as hell! Step 2, go rent a teamspeak server because skype sucks. Jump on that mic and run through the campaign with your friends in one caffiene fuled night of pure call of duty bliss. Enjoy the call of duty franchise before it got ruined with 13 year olds on xbox live, a lack of dedicated servers, and constant product endorsements from mountain dew and doritos! -Pr0XIDIAN			"

												World at War is a game where it's fun to play for a while like zombies, then you are like, ""Only 4 maps? And I've play them all?"" Well then it's time to download maps. That is probably the only reason I bought this game is because of the custom maps made by the community. The community can make some really good and cool maps. The popular ones are the best and have some good customization. When I used to play this on ps3, I play the coop campaign all the time with my brother and we used to just beat it all the time cause we were both just good at WAW. Honestly, everyone played this on console, and then saw custom zombies and bought it for that only. I only play custom zombies and they never get old either. Recommend if you like custom zombies.

												This game is absolutely amazing.  Many people consider it the last good cod came, and I wont say their wrong.  The campaign is intense, although quite gory.  The only downside i have founde is that almost every multiplayer server is hacked so you can barely play.  The primary reason I got this game was for zombies.  Well, custom zombies.  If you didn't know, you can download maps as a mod and play them.  You could also make them, but thats extremely difficult.  Overall, this is a great game and worth every penny.			"

												A really good fps shooter. One of the best in the COD series. The campaign is good, but I'm not too big of a fan of the multiplayer. The best part of the game is zombies! I just love zombies. In my eyes, this game could have been made just for zombies, but that's me. I wish the COD team can go back to these kind of games and expecially zombies, I will definetly buy it, if they do.			"

There is such an awesome Custom Zombies community and soooooo many maps you can play aside from the maps that come with the game!

												This is an honest review of Call of Duty: World at War   There's few games that really outshine this one. I've been playing this game for a long time, even though It says I've only got 70 or so hours at the moment. My favorite gamemode is by far the zombies, don't get me wrong, the campaign and multiplayer are fantastic. But the zombies is where this game really shines in my opinion.Pros:-Awesome story-Huge multiplayer maps with vehicles -Extremely realistic hardcore mode-Zombies-Custom, downloadable zombies and multiplaer maps-An actually quality level PC portCons:-Small-ish community-Very hard to get into low-ping public zombies servers-Graphics are outdated (not that it really matters to me, but it's a con for most people)-Crashes happen when you try to switch your online profile-Tanks are OP (as they should be, but its none the less annoying)FINAL VERDICT:  Overall, You could have many hours of fun with your friends in this game. If you have no friends who play this game, it is less of a rewarding experience. If you do buy this game, I would highly recommend playing through the campaign, it is really worth your time.SCORE: 9.5/10			"

												           To start the review there are four words you need to know about this game:""One Of The Best!""The rest of the review will consist of things that are great about this game in numerical order.1.Amazing Graphics-Imressive.2.The dual battling campaign is amazing with the Russians battling the Germans and the Americans over in Japan.3.Nazi Zombies is the best mode ever-There are all most unlimited downloadable mapsto choose from such as zombiemodding and ugx_maps. Some maps are straight up hilarious and other, battling to your last breath.4.Npc's-Npc's in this game are not those other npc's who shoot at walls over and over again and don't act like you want them to. 5.Multiplayer-This is never ending fun! I love themaps where you can drive tanks and battle tank vs. tank battles.6. Tis game is never laggy for me and my computer isn't the newest computer out there.7. If I had to rate this game it would be a 10/10, totally get this game!			"

												Call of Duty: World at War is a great game. The campaign is engaging and replayable, the multiplayer is fun and enjoyable, and the zombies mode that was introduced from this game that is still in the newer Treyarch titles is a fun game to play with friends.Pros-[Campaign]- Good story and characters, engages you, challenges you, and is only the lead into the stories of BO1 and 2.[MP]- People still play this almost 9 year old game.[MP]- Guns are varying, meaning you aren't going to get killed by one gun and one only (but beware of PPsh users)[ZM]- Simple and easy to learn.[ZM]- Fun for co-op or online.[ZM]- Custom zombies.[Campaign]- This is a personal opinion, but this game is gorey-er than other COD campaigns, and I think it impoves immersionCons-[Campaign]- Although I said its challenging, sometimes it's too much so.[Campaign]- The Pacific Theatre gets boring towards the end, and you almost want it to end there.[MP]- Juggernaut. Enough said.[MP]- Anymore, most servers are not vanilla, meaning it will probably be modded in some way.[ZM]- It gets repetitive after a while, due to simplicity.Final Verdict-Campaign- 8.75/10. It's good, but not amazing.Multiplayer- 9/10. Probably the best multiplayer in a COD game.Zombies- 9.5/10. The second best Zombies mode so far, only behind Black Ops 1.Overall [Average of all scores]- 9.11/10. My favorite COD, and to many others one of the best in the series.			"

												( First impression review )AWESOME game though can't find a single person to play classic zombies :/ but overall good game love it though the multiplayer is something eh i'm not use to lol i've played through black ops and mw3 multiplayer and waw's multiplayer is way better it feels way down to the game for new players i haven't seen stuff like this in along time my vote 10/10 recommend you buy it :D( Edit 1)After playing this game for x ammount of tme and running it through ""most"" of it's paces i've decided to edit my review of this game, the game is great all around but in some aspects/features it lacks so i'ma get down to my review at the bottom of this starting with the story mode.1. Story Mode/single player- I found this game's story quite good though it's very laggy and hard to get into at first I give it a 5/10.2. Story Mode/Co op - when playing the story mode with friends my game as well as theirs would crash for no appearant reason and i have yet to find the cause i give the co op story mode a 2/103. Networking/match making - when joining a co op round with a friend in rare times either person was unable to join the other's match and i have yet to find a cause or a fix to this issue and it is quite rare i give networking/matchmaking a 6/10 for all around.4. Solo mode zombies - I find this one of the best modes of the game i love it the most cause i can sit and play even with out cheats and go Very far in waves or rounds and have music playing with out worrying about my team mates i give solo mode zombies a 10/105. Co op Zombies - I find it hard to find a match for zombies it's sometimes none existant when it is most of the time it's modded maps or people using cheats of some kind but for just private matchs with friends i give the co op zombies a 10/10 for online use i give it a 0/10 because i can't play in a public match because it's mostly private premade teams now.6. Multiplayer - I like the Multiplayer of world at war but most of the servers are either using cheats or mods and it's extremely hard to find a match enless you custom search one for with out mods or cheats that is in the game mode you desire, Also with most servers the health is very low that being said in most servers the bullets that it takes to kill you are around 3 to 5 rather than almost a full clip depending on the right happen i find this a major disappointment because it's hard to find the guy and shoot him before he shoots me and most times it's a one shot from accross the map so i give multiplayer a 6/10.7. Graghics/ effects - I have yet to put these through their paces because i'm still running on low settings because my laptop sucks but when i get my new computer and re run this game at max i'll revise my review and add my rating on these but for now i can't.8. Sound effects - I have to give the sound effects a strong 9/10 they are superb 99 times in each match depending on the weapon.9. mechanics - the game is old that being said i can't even give it a strong review on these because of it being as old as it is so i'ma give the mechanics a 10/10 for them being as old as they are10. playerbase - This game has good playerbase alot of nice peopl and such and it's very easy to get a co op or co op zombie match going this being said i give it a 10/1011. Taking out of all my reviews i give the entire game a 8/10 for it's age and the fact that in some features i can't really put them through their full potential yet i will however do so when i get a better computer.

												TL;DR at the bottom My second favorite Call of Duty! Ohhh my god this game! THIS GAME! I can't express to you how much I love Call of Duty: World at War. It's an EXTREMELY close second to Black Ops 2. This game was fun back in 2008 and is still fun to this day! Campaign: This is the last WWII game in the franchise which was sort of a bummer for some people. However, the campaign was really great. It was very long, you were always at the edge of your toes to see what happens next, lots of different gun variety, and you could even play the ENTIRE campaign MULTIPLAYER! This is the only Call of Duty game that let's you do that. Something that I think all the Call of Duty's should let you do. Multiplayer: Multiplayer is amazing  especially  on PC. I have this game for both PS3 and PC. While their may be more people playing it on the console version, the PC version is not hacked and there are community made mods like modern weapons, different gamemodes, and many more. Of course you can play your traditional / old school / classic World at War you know and love, but you do have variety. All matches are hosted on dedicated servers and all of them  can  go up to 64 PLAYERS! Not all servers are like this, but a good ammount of them are. The console version only went up to 18 as the max. So if you like classic World War II Multiplayer type shooters with a lot of gamemode variety, you'll love this! Nazi Zombies: This is where the game really shines (in my opinion) ESPECIALLY on the PC. If you've played WaW on PC, you know exactly what I'm talking about: CUSTOM ZOMBIES. Now before I go into that I'll go over original zombies first. WaW has only 4 zombies maps to choose from. You can play all of these Singleplayer and Multiplayer. This is the game where it all started. Thanks to Treyarch allowing mods for World at War on the PC, you have endless possibilities of different maps you can get. You can Google: ""Custom Zombie Maps"" and you'll get a bunch of results from different websites and map creators. If they could add Steam Workshop to this game, it would be WAY easier to get mods and custom maps for both Zombies and Multiplayer. World at War Zombies on the PC is HANDSDOWN one of the best Zombie experiences you'll ever have in a video game! TL;DR / Summary Overall, Call of Duty: World at War is one of the best Call of Duty games in the world! It is a must buy (in my opinion) if you haven't already tried the game out yet. This is one of the few cases where I recommend you get it on PC over console, because this is one of the fewer Call of Duty games that are SO MUCH BETETR on PC. Call of Dut: World at War is a fun experience for Singleplauer, Multiplayer, and Co-op and is a must have for WWII and Zombie fans!Overall rating 9.5/10!			"

												Unlike with my Black Ops 2 review, this game comes as one game under your Steam Library but is a 3 part game, Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies. So i will be doing the one review for the parts individually.WaW - CampaignIts Veteran Campaign is the hardest campaign i have ever completed on any game ever.  Regardless of wether it is a CoD or Battlefield or friggin' The Sims, i don't care it's purely hard.  Unfortunately (Or fortunately in this case) the Steam version of this game does not have achievements so i cannot prove i have completed it on Veteren, and honestly i havent completed it on Veteren on Steam.  I completed the Veteren campaign on the PS3 version of this game a long while back before i started PC gaming. After having gotten every single achievement and my Platinum Trophy i vowed to never ever ever attempt this Veteren Campaign again.  As i said earlier unfortunately this version doesnt have achievements so i dont have enough reason to attempt such a feat again to prove my worth. I can assure you back in the day there was much rage, controller throwing and much swearing loudly. I have since barely ever raged again, im pretty sure it's because no matter how hard something is or how much better a player in a multiplayer game is than me, there is always this Veteren campaign that is harder.Having said all of that i really enjoyed the campaign, despite it being clearly quite old by todays standards it's quite a fun campaign (as long as you are not attempting it on Veteren)WaW - MultiplayerThis game is old and this does reflect in the multiplayer games.  There are quite a lot of One Shot lobbies in the multiplayer mode, it seems to be the more popular due to how much fun the sniper rifles are in this game and how old it is too i guess.  You can find some normal team deathmatch games here too but its not a super busy game on the multiplayer servers from what i have seen, most people will have moved on to the newer CoD multiplayer games i imagine.WaW - ZombiesThis is the game mode that you buy this game for. World at War created Zombies, this was the first ever CoD game to put a zombies mode in.  Having said that you only get one base map which isnt that great.  What is pretty great is that all of the DLC for the Steam version of this game is completely free so you can get 3 other zombies maps too. This is unlike the PS3 version i played many moons ago in which i had to buy all the DLC. The DLC Zombies maps on this game do pale in comparison to the newer CoD games with zombies but that is to be expected since its the first time they have existed in CoD.So that is awesome you have 4 zombies maps just like the console versions. LOL. This is PC ♥♥♥♥♥ES!!!! For the PC version of this game you have a WHOLE COMMUNITY based on ZOMBIES.  There are literally THOUSANDS of Custom Built maps for this game. You can find such maps all completely FREE to download at many numorous websites that host links to maps made by Custom Mappers. You can see hundreds and thousands of videos on Youtube if you pretty much just type 'custom zombies' into youtube search bar to see huge varieties of maps. There are maps that are designed entierly from the map makers imagination or maps made based on real life enviroments wether it be the mappers workplace, house or local supermarket. There are maps based on TV shows such as The Simpsons, Family Guy, Spongebob Squarepants, My Little Pony - Yes i said My Little Pony!!Even i myself have made a few custom maps - the mod tools are free for anyone to use to create your own maps usually available from the many websites that host these maps alongside tutorials on how to use them and many forum posts giving advice on how to use them.So that is why you buy this game pretty much only for the custom zombies maps, you could spend probably over 2000 hours playing every single map for like 30 minutes each easy with probably some maps you could spend a few hours playing.Some of the websites you can find custom maps and tutorials on how to make your own etc:zombiemodding.comugx-mods.comundeadmodding.comtriple-mgames.comand so on, there are tonnes of them :P			"

												Honestly one of my all time favorite cods, no other cod has ever had the same spirit as waw. Waw felt terrifying at times, the match will get quiet until you hear the echo of a rifle crack across the map, taking out your teammates leg in a horrifying fashion. This was the only cod to ever actually feature real gibbing (aside from zombies and that scene in cod 4 where you shoot someones arm off). I always make fun of cod for being mindless and such but this one is considered (to me) to be the best and I would recommend it to ANYONE. Its replayability is almost infinite as long as there are friends and good servers. Also there are custom zombie maps if you get bored or just want a break from the originals.			"

												An amazing story, great characters, and surprisingly supurb graphics make it one of the best games in the Call of Duty franchise. Recently, they've just been focusing on the gameplay/weapons/utilities rather than the story itself. Another cool thing is, this still has a community of players -- +1,000 players strong. 8 years after release, it remains as one of the most well made CoD games.			"

												This is one of the call of duty games that i seriously recommend everyone should get it, there is a metric ton of mods due to the sheer amount of mods that have come out for this game, pretty much any gun in the call of duty series can be found here, due to the engine being the same the features can be added as well, all the other zombie maps are in this game, all the modes, all the sounds, all the fun, all the content. Granted it works best when you have a friend to play this game with as that is when it will really shine, espeically the zombies modes with all of the custom maps that it can provide. If you like hoard style shooters or just want a solid fps then this is certainly a game that should be on your radar even 7 years after it came out.			"

												Remaster World at War Please for 2017 !!!FInal world war II game by call of duty , introducing the battlefront upon the pacific featuring the battle at okinawa and other major battles along the turning tides of pacific. Along the starts of the pacfic the major focus on the eastern front on the advance of the soviet red army into nazi germany , including battles such as the battle of stalingrad ,seige of berlin. However the main focus on private reznov on his story upon the leading events in call of duty black ops . Overall the multiplayer gameplay is very lacking as it faces the road of extinction with its population dying day by day .The best part of the game in focused on zombies as the game introduces the new zombie mode and first maps such as nachet de toten , verruckt , shi no nu ma and der ries , overall interesting game for everyone to consider getting !GAME IS STILL ALIVE !!!

												Those who is familiar with the previous Call of Duty, can't imagine World at War. Take Modern WarfareКраткая information on game with its mechanics of fight, Chernobyl dogs murderers, branchy Russian ""cranberry"" and send to World War II era. To take away reproaches in secondariness (eventually, on this lawn CoD 1, 2 and 3 were trampled down), add the mad Japanese, the torn-off extremities, a mode of joint passing on four, expanded system the multipleernykh of ""perok"" and the mini-game Nazi Zombies. Ah yes, and the tank with self-repairing armor. Call of Duty: World at War — some step back in comparison with last game of a series, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. The plot instead of the present offers again us cloyed World War II, however, with not the most boring campaigns — the USA here battle to Japan, and to punish Germans honor dropped out to the Soviet soldiers. Game process thus doesn't have ingenious statement, that is here, of course, both beautiful rollers, and qualitatively zaskriptovanny events, and various unexpected situations, but everything is made strictly ""on the four"", it is no more. As a result game which we will remember hardly in a year — so turned out, to take place, a little посражаться in a multiplayer and to forget. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).

												Easily one of if not my favorite CODs, this game is the one that changed it all. The great story, great characters and gameplay it offers a great variety of missions to play. I have always been into COD Zombies and because of the mod options of this one, you can make it almost an entirely different game. It really is hard to find something to complain about here, even though the graphics may not be Order 1866 level it still holds up and the dark grays and blood help set the mood. I got this game when it was on sale. but I think it is fully worth its base price and is a game I still play to this day.			"

												First of all, the Call of Duty Franchise has had it's ups and downs but this game is a classic. The Campaign drops you in harsh environments which is amazing. The story telling is fantastic. Multiplayer, well it is an outdated game and is filled with hackers everywhere but still you should give it a try. And Nazi Zombies, is worthy of having its own game. The four base maps are excellent but where zombies really shines is the mod feature which allows you to play custom maps that are made by the community. This game is great with friends or by yourself either way you will have a great time.			"

Review:Even if you hate or dislike Call of Duty, this is more than just any other CoD. There are an array of free custom mods, maps, zombies, bosses, and more. I'm not going to complain about the $20 price tag either, because this game still has a large online multiplayer and plenty of mods to never leave you bored.Game-play:This game is by far, probably the best Call of Duty ever because it is the most fun, chaotic game-play experience for multi-player and zombies ever. (and there's still mods being released to this day!)Nostalgia:This game is my childhood, and the WWII genre is by far my favorite. I absolutely love this game, along with Black Ops 1* and CoD 4. I doubt anyone who buys this will be disappointed.*Black Ops 1's price tag is way too high, and the DLC is expensive as hell, so RIP my fav CoD game.			"

												Well, what can I say about this game? I can start off by saying that it is the most  outstanding brilliant  game modded!Being a modded game may sound bad but it does come with its advantages! Main advantage: Modded Zombies. People mainly buy this game mostly for the zombies purely because the multiplayer servers for CoD: WAW is pretty much dead, everyone plays the later instalments of CoD but if you're a true zombie player like yoteslaya or yamimash, then you will love this game.This game has the standard campaign and when you finish that, you will unlock a game mode called Zombies.Zombies is a game mode where you will receive an endless amount of zombies going up in waves. E.g. wave 1: 8 zombies, wave 2: 14 zombies and so on. Because this game is quite dated, it is easily modded and most of the modders live on a site called  www.zombiemodding.com There are hundreds of zombies maps designed for CoD: WAW zombie players, modded to the extreme as they include; Custom Zombie maps designed by the community, not any standard zombies map Guns are ported across from MW1/MW2/MW3/Black ops 1/2 and maybe some AW guns in the future! Player models can be changed for example, in some WAW maps you can play as some of the characters from Black ops 1: Call of the Dead The list just goes on!Second Advantage:It's not even that hard to download modded zombie maps, on the website www.zombiemodding.com they simply ask you to download an .exe file which will install the zombie maps in the directory C:\Users\<YOUR COMPUTER NAME> \AppData\Local\activision\codwaw\mods.If you even wanted to design your own zombie map, it takes about a few days to learn how to do it and a good couple of weeks to finish of a piece of well-designed work. Not much code involved.   How do i play these maps?   http://store.steampowered.comYou have to click the ""MODS"" option which will bring up a list of your installed maps. url=store.steampowered.com] http://i.imgur.com/dralY4T.jpg [/url]  Google chrome says these modded maps from zombie modding are malicious?  I am not quite sure why google chrome says these maps are malicious, probably because they are .exe files. Don't worry, if you download them from zombie modding then they should be virus free, if not report them on the website. Thank you for reading my review, if it's any good thumbs up so others can see.			"

												Call of Duty: World at War; This is the best CoD hands down. Despite it's 2008 release date, this CoD game remains the winner of the best CoD (My opinion, don't get your ♥♥♥♥ into a twist)  due to the harshness of the war, the astounding (Not entirely hacked) Multiplayer, and my personal favorite, Nazi zombies. While this game may have been made in 2008 don't think the community is dead, daily custom zombie maps are being made which offers unlimited replayability meaning that for a 2008 game, it has more content than all the other CoD's put together. The multi-player is also amazing, if you choose a non hacked lobby I guarantee you will have an awesome time on it, without having to worry about all those 10-13 year olds who ""sleep"" with your mom. As for the campaign, it puts you in the place of different people fighting on different sides during WW2, it is harsh, bloody, and total hell on veteran difficulty. Perfect for gorehounds like me who like a challenge :) . There should be no reason to not pick this game up if you have the funds. Since for $20 it has offered 200 and counting hours of fun gameplay.

												The best installment in the series. By far. 8/10. The game is alive, it's a sickly, injured, poor game. But it's alive. And what I mean by that is, I need people to play. Nobody hosts, and nobody joins. The multiplayer is decent, and the zombies are amazing. "

												My second favorite Call of Duty of all time. In my unpopular opinion, it achieved the greatness Call of Duty 4 was going for but didn't fully conquer. It's an authentic World War II shooter with plenty of weapons of the era to choose from. The story (which can be played in co-op) and characters are for the most part very good despite being significantly short, and the gameplay is frantic and exciting. The multiplayer is amazing in pretty much every sense, with an unconventional design for Call of Duty's standards. This was the one in the series that started zombies as well, and while Nacht Der Untoten isn't a highlight of the game mode it is raw and hardcore, and Der Riese is outstanding especially with friends. Filled with mysteries. The mode also gave birth to the marvelous soundtrack provided by Kevin Sherwood & Elena Siegman. Treyarch did a fine job with this one. 8.1/10.0 "

I was watching a lot of Custom Zombie Maps for that game and i was wandering to buy that game to play with my firends. Today i did it, i bought the game i and i am happy.I want to make kinda of a small pros/cons table PROS:-Graphics are pretty good -Gameplay is ok if you want to kill some Japanese asses (dont be angry on me i am not a racist)-Weapons, i can talk a lot about them -Zombies are AWESOME -Custom Maps CONS:-To hard to be leveled up in mp-Over racism-Zombies are quite hard for new players-Not a lot of players now a days-Some bugs-Graphics are not amazing-Same with gameplay In the end i want to say that if you want to buy that game make sure some one form your friend list owns that game so you will not play alone :D if what add me Kamikazi300Thx ACTIVISION for that game :D "

												The best thing I love about this game is the full campaign coop! You can play coop with your friend for the story campaign from start to the end. The campaign story is quite interesting, and contains a lot of different aspect of war for you to experience: like being a captured hostage waiting to be executed, using a flamethrower to burn enemy fortress, shooting snipers out of the trees, and driving a friggin tank!The zombie mode provides a lot of extra fun if you have friends to play with. Being an old game, there are a huge library of custom maps and mods for this game that are very stable and fun on the internet.Beware though. Despite being a very old release, I still cannot play it in high graphic settings. I need to lower my resolution to lower-than-average to get playable framerates. This game is really poorly optimized.It would be better if this game had Steam achievements.My score: 8/10			"

												This ♥♥♥♥ing game......worth every ruble!I just recently bought this game on PC (A few months ago) but I have so much experience playing this game especially on Xbox.Now for PC I've never really tried playing the multiplayer all that much so this review is mainly based upon Nazi Zombies.Like, holy ♥♥♥♥, I've played Nazi Zombies on Xbox for years (On the later CoD's as well). And I must say this one is by far the best on PC.Why?CUSTOM NAZI ♥♥♥♥ING ZOMBIES, THAT'S WHY! You can go to certain websites that allow you to download Zombie Maps made by people, and there are maps still being created to this day! It never gets old!You can play them on solo but playing with people is just so much more fun!Five years from now I will still be playing this game.Maybe Treyarch will revamp this game in the future ;)Definitely worth $19.99 for the amount of custom maps you can get for yourself.

												The German army began the blitzkrieg on 10 May 1940, the German Army Group B, led by Fedor von Bock, assaulted the BEF on 14 May. As Army Group B pushed the Allied forces back towards the French frontier, the German Army Group A, led by Gerd von Rundstedt, invaded France through the Ardennes. This caught the French unawares. The French High Command was sure that the expensive line of underground forts on the Maginot Line would stop any German attack. The Germans, however, decided not to attack this line. Instead they attacked the weakest part of the French defences, the Ardennes. This was a heavily wooded area that seemed unsuitable for tanks. The French had assumed it was unsuitable for tanks because it was a hilly and wooded area. French resistance crumbled as the German tanks raced to the Channel coast, where the Germans planned to cut off the retreat of the British Expeditionary Force. The German forces simply bypassed the Maginot line which was a situation not anticipated by the defending Allies. The offensive by Army Group A cut communications between French and British commands and after approaching Sedan the German group turned northwards. On 13 May 1940, the Germans launched a Blitzkrieg attack on Belgium and Holland. It was an outstanding success. German attacks rolled swiftly across Holland and Belgium. Dutch attempts to delay the German advance by opening the dykes and flooding the land were ineffective. The Germans used glider planes to land behind the Belgian line of defences and outflank their defenders. Holland surrendered in five days after a huge bombing of Rotterdam. Thirteen days later the Belgians surrendered. The Netherlands and Luxembourg were overrun by 19 May. . By 20 May 1940, huge numbers of British and French soldiers found themselves cut off from the rest of their forces. The push by Army Group A towards the coast combined with the approach of Army Group B from the northeast left the BEF surrounded on three sides by 21 May. The British forces attempted to stop the offensive and launched counter-attacks including at Arras on 21 May. Fortunately for the British, on 20 May, Hitler gave the order to the German commander, Guderian, to stop his tanks in order to allow the Luftwaffe, the German air force, to complete the destruction of the British and French forces. This was a mistake which allowed the British time to regroup. However, the BEF was unable to repel the Germans and it became clear that the Channel ports were threatened. Fresh troops were rushed from England to defend Bolougne and Calais, but after hard fighting, both ports were in German hands by 26 May. General Gort ordered that the BEF should withdraw to Dunkirk, the only port remaining, for evacuation. The British launched ‘Operation Dynamo’. Between 27 May and 4 June, as the Luftwaffe pounded the beaches, the Royal Navy and a host of vessels ranging from yachts to pleasure boats crossed the Channel to rescue the stranded troops.  "

												This game, dating back to when cod was actually good and had a great story, is a World War 2 themed FPS.Even with its dated graphics, super-modded multiplayer, and overall obsoleteness, its still worth picking up for its story mode, and the zombies mode,But wait, why not get BO2, or BO1 for zombies, you ask?Well CoD:Waw is the only cod with zombies that you can get custom maps for, this means MORE maps, MORE weapons, MORE story, and overall just a better experience.Whether you want to kick Nazi ♥♥♥, or kick Undead Nazi ♥♥♥, this game is a must have.

												The German army began the blitzkrieg on 10 May 1940, the German Army Group B, led by Fedor von Bock, assaulted the BEF on 14 May. As Army Group B pushed the Allied forces back towards the French frontier, the German Army Group A, led by Gerd von Rundstedt, invaded France through the Ardennes. This caught the French unawares. The French High Command was sure that the expensive line of underground forts on the Maginot Line would stop any German attack. The Germans, however, decided not to attack this line. Instead they attacked the weakest part of the French defences, the Ardennes. This was a heavily wooded area that seemed unsuitable for tanks. The French had assumed it was unsuitable for tanks because it was a hilly and wooded area. French resistance crumbled as the German tanks raced to the Channel coast, where the Germans planned to cut off the retreat of the British Expeditionary Force. The German forces simply bypassed the Maginot line which was a situation not anticipated by the defending Allies. The offensive by Army Group A cut communications between French and British commands and after approaching Sedan the German group turned northwards. On 13 May 1940, the Germans launched a Blitzkrieg attack on Belgium and Holland. It was an outstanding success. German attacks rolled swiftly across Holland and Belgium. Dutch attempts to delay the German advance by opening the dykes and flooding the land were ineffective. The Germans used glider planes to land behind the Belgian line of defences and outflank their defenders. Holland surrendered in five days after a huge bombing of Rotterdam. Thirteen days later the Belgians surrendered. The Netherlands and Luxembourg were overrun by 19 May. . By 20 May 1940, huge numbers of British and French soldiers found themselves cut off from the rest of their forces. The push by Army Group A towards the coast combined with the approach of Army Group B from the northeast left the BEF surrounded on three sides by 21 May. The British forces attempted to stop the offensive and launched counter-attacks including at Arras on 21 May. Fortunately for the British, on 20 May, Hitler gave the order to the German commander, Guderian, to stop his tanks in order to allow the Luftwaffe, the German air force, to complete the destruction of the British and French forces. This was a mistake which allowed the British time to regroup. However, the BEF was unable to repel the Germans and it became clear that the Channel ports were threatened. Fresh troops were rushed from England to defend Bolougne and Calais, but after hard fighting, both ports were in German hands by 26 May. General Gort ordered that the BEF should withdraw to Dunkirk, the only port remaining, for evacuation. The British launched ‘Operation Dynamo’. Between 27 May and 4 June, as the Luftwaffe pounded the beaches, the Royal Navy and a host of vessels ranging from yachts to pleasure boats crossed the Channel to rescue the stranded troops.  "

												Call of Duty: World at War, also referred to as Call of Duty 5 or simply World at War, and abbreviated as CoD: WaW or WaW, is a first-person shooter game produced by Treyarch, and is the first game in the ""Black Ops"" timeline. It was released on November 11, 2008 in North America and on November 14, 2008 in Europe. It was announced on December 2, 2007, and on June 6, 2008; the 64th anniversary of D-Day, Treyarch announced it would be named as ""World at War"" and it would take place in the Pacific theater of war as well as the Eastern Front.There is one campaign in the game divided into two: the American campaign and the Soviet campaign. The Soviet campaign is returning after having last been present in Call of Duty 2. There is no British campaign in the game, making World at War the only major Call of Duty set in the Second World War not to feature a British Campaign or a British playable character. It features both a solo and co-op campaign, however both are the same except that co-op is played with multiple people and certain missions are absoloutly unplayable.The American campaign is set in the Pacific theater on the islands of Makin, Peleliu, and Okinawa. The Soviet campaign is set in the Eastern Front, mainly in Nazi Germany. In the American campaign, players take the role of Pvt. C. Miller as he fights alongside Sgt. Tom Sullivan, Cpl. Roebuck (later Sergeant), and Pvt. Polonsky. In the Soviet campaign, players take the role of Pvt. Dimitri Petrenko as he fights alongside the merciless Sgt. Viktor Reznov and the merciful Pvt. Chernov. In the American campaign, players, for the first time in a Call of Duty game, fight against the Japanese Imperial Army. Most combat takes place in jungles, where ambushes are likely. Combat also takes place in small mortar pits, ridges, beach heads, Japanese trenches, and small villages. Bunkers are a common sight in the American campaign, usually causing heavy casualties. In the Soviet Campaign, players fight against the German Wehrmacht during the push towards Berlin. Combat takes place, at first, in the ruins of Stalingrad where the player is mainly a sniper. After that, combat occurs in farmland and forests of the German town of Seelow, and finally Berlin is assaulted and close quarter fighting becomes a common feature. The last mission of the Soviet campaign sees the Red Army capture the Reichstag and the player planting the Soviet Flag on top of the building.			"

												Being somebody that has been a fan of Zombies ever since its debut, I strongly recommend this game to any CoD Zombie fan. While the Treyarch maps are good, they eventually grow tiresome and you are left waiting for the next installment. With World @ War, you will never have that problem thanks to the modding community.Custom Zombies are amazing, some of the maps being as good as those made by Treyarch, some even better. Even after owning this game for so long, I find myself going back it when a talented person releases a new map. Trust me, Zombie Fans, this game is worth a purchase. Lock, load and slay up into the high rounds or die trying, this game will never get old.  "

 World War II at it's  finest  bloodiest! What the newest Call of Duty games fail to strive for is depth. And I'm not not talking about a good story (which this game still has), I'm talking about  literal  depth. Because World at War isn't trying to see how many explosions it can fit into each mission, like modern CODs. Rather, it's providing you with an experience.+ Story - COD: WaW is a warfare masterpiece. This game isn't about completing missions and then moving on to the next one without a thought; it's about a personal story. As the US Marines, you are sent into the dark jungles of the Japanese. The game makes you feel how it was to be trapped in war: no way out. As the Soviets, you witness the cruelty of not only the German Reich, but Russia's as well. You take part in an epic campaign to push your way into the heart of the German war machine, never stopping nor hesitating as men on both sides are gunned down without mercy. You might make friends along the way, but will they survive?+ Environment - As you play, you can feel the essence of how it felt to be a World War II soldier slowly gripping you. The terrifying silence of the Okinawa jungles, the depressing remains of Russian cities burned to the ground, war as it was. There's no one coming to help you, it's only you and your comrades. There is no shortage of realism in this game.+ Sound - I can easily say without a doubt that WaW has the best soundtrack in the entire COD franchise - maybe even the greatest in any WWII game ever. Victory suddenly doesn't seem so far as you listen to the haunting choir while ascending the steps of the Reichstag. The combination of music and gameplay fits perfectly.+ Graphics - Even today, the look of this game holds it's own. While I can't guarantee triple-A virtual reality graphics, it's definitely not short on visual appeal.+ Mods & Zombies - The ability to freely mod this game opens a wide array of opportunities for frequent players. Especially having the ability to add custom maps for WaW's bonus mode - zombies - is an amazing add-on. These abilities ensure that you will not run out of things to do, even after finishing the glorious campaign and exploring multiplayer.When it all comes down to it, Call of Duty: World at War is still a masterpiece even to this day. It is still one of my favorite first-person shooters of all time, as well as being my favorite COD.9/10			"

												Welcome to another episode of Agrobal reviews an ""FPS"" :DJust as I was about to expect the same from every Call of Duty game, I get surprised by this campaign. It reminds me a lot of CoD pre-mainstream era. I actually like this campaign a lot. The usual running and gunning here and there. Annoying japanese soldiers that wont stop saying BANZAAAAIIII. Kiefer Sutherland's voice is magical. Maybe it is his voice that acts like a spell I am under. The gameplay is the same. I'd like to bring up the fact that I noticed in every CoD campaign, the player is a grenade magnet. At one point I was late reach an objective, the AI was ready to ambush me with 4 grenades at once--BOOM. Nothing underwhelming here, I am just glad I turned a blind eye after finishing the campaign and reading ""zombies"".			"

Also, it has a very strong and enjoyable Campaign that you can play co-op. which makes it so much better.

												My personal Favorite Call of Duty title. Grenades flying at you constantly on veteran; good times by the way. The modding community has done alot for World at War's multiplayer, like increased xp servers and low gravity servers. There are only 3 different types of killstreak rewards: Recon plane, Artillery, and Dogs. And the dogs in World at War are a 2 hit kill instead of the stupid 1 hit kill in Black ops and so on. but that's what I like about World at War's multiplayer. There's no ridiculous killstreaks like the ones we have in Modern Warfare 3 and so on. I have also encountered zero hackers in World at War's multiplayer.Zombies: Back when the zombies mode was original and good. Modded maps are awsome. Today, Treyarch bends the zombies story to the point where it is no longer interesting and milking the hell out of their player base with outrageously priced DLC packs! Don't buy them. Not to mention that the zombies mode is now significantly more limited and difficult to the point that it's no longer fun in the Black ops titles. But World at War's zombies are simply the best.Call of Duty: World at War gets a 9/10. That's gonna do it for this review and I will see you guys on the next oneLet's form up!   ~Stealth 1548			"

What makes it worth your $$$ is the multiplayer system, that let you develop you skill and variety of options on field. There's also the Zombie mode that can be nice to play for a few more hours, but it is a little annoying to start all over from level 1 each time you die.Note to myself: replay when you need to shoot something.

												Being somebody that has been a fan of Zombies ever since its debut, I strongly recommend this game to any CoD Zombie fan. While the Treyarch maps are good, they eventually grow tiresome and you are left waiting for the next installment. With World @ War, you will never have that problem thanks to the modding community.Custom Zombies are amazing, some of the maps being as good as those made by Treyarch, some even better. Even after owning this game for so long, I find myself going back it when a talented person releases a new map. Trust me, Zombie Fans, this game is worth a purchase. Lock, load and slay up into the high rounds or die trying, this game will never get old.  "

												Ah.. World at War.. The best Call of Duty there ever was. I really recommend it. You can't get bored of it. The campain was the best! And there is Custom Zombies. I love that. Endless maps that you and you're friends can play on for hours! Myself,my favorite map is Cheese Cube (yeah ikxD) And the multiplayer... Well... If u take away all the hacker it's one of the best multiplayer in Call of Duty's history. So grab you're wallet,pray to Gaben and buy it!			"

												Infinity Wards WWII Russian campaigns have always been the weakest of the Original Call Of Duty games for me, usually with no central ally unlike the other nations campaigns which included Captain Foley or Captain Price etc. It seems Treyarch learned from Infinity Wards mistake however because the Russian campaign in WaW is fantastic. Led throughout by Resnov through some brilliant missions culminating in a remake of the original Call Of Duty's assualt on the Berlin headquarters the Russian segment oozes quality. The US section however is the weakest this time around which doesn't make it bad just not up to the standard of the Russian campaign.The visuals in this game bring war torn streets and buildings of Europe to life like non of the previous games in the series and the enhanced body damage finally makes grenades and high powered machine guns satisfying as they rip through the bodies of your enemies.I find it difficult to decide which games is better between this and CoD 2 because this is a lot more linear in it's level design and CoD 2 has massive maps with multiple objectives.However WaW is a great single player campaign and also the first in the series to introduce zombie mode for added longevity.Fantastic entry into the WWII series of CoDs and maybe even the best one.

 World War II at it's  finest  bloodiest! What the newest Call of Duty games fail to strive for is depth. And I'm not not talking about a good story (which this game still has), I'm talking about  literal  depth. Because World at War isn't trying to see how many explosions it can fit into each mission, like modern CODs. Rather, it's providing you with an experience.+ Story - COD: WaW is a warfare masterpiece. This game isn't about completing missions and then moving on to the next one without a thought; it's about a personal story. As the US Marines, you are sent into the dark jungles of the Japanese. The game makes you feel how it was to be trapped in war: no way out. As the Soviets, you witness the cruelty of not only the German Reich, but Russia's as well. You take part in an epic campaign to push your way into the heart of the German war machine, never stopping nor hesitating as men on both sides are gunned down without mercy. You might make friends along the way, but will they survive?+ Environment - As you play, you can feel the essence of how it felt to be a World War II soldier slowly gripping you. The terrifying silence of the Okinawa jungles, the depressing remains of Russian cities burned to the ground, war as it was. There's no one coming to help you, it's only you and your comrades. There is no shortage of realism in this game.+ Sound - I can easily say without a doubt that WaW has the best soundtrack in the entire COD franchise - maybe even the greatest in any WWII game ever. Victory suddenly doesn't seem so far as you listen to the haunting choir while ascending the steps of the Reichstag. The combination of music and gameplay fits perfectly.+ Graphics - Even today, the look of this game holds it's own. While I can't guarantee triple-A virtual reality graphics, it's definitely not short on visual appeal.+ Mods & Zombies - The ability to freely mod this game opens a wide array of opportunities for frequent players. Especially having the ability to add custom maps for WaW's bonus mode - zombies - is an amazing add-on. These abilities ensure that you will not run out of things to do, even after finishing the glorious campaign and exploring multiplayer.When it all comes down to it, Call of Duty: World at War is still a masterpiece even to this day. It is still one of my favorite first-person shooters of all time, as well as being my favorite COD.9/10			"

Their is map being created everyday and you'll never get bored of played the zombies! Call of Duty: World at War has the best Original Zombies experience and the only Custom Zombie experience!

												Call of Duty: World at War - The 5th Installment in the Call of Duty SeriesThe vanilla game comes with three different modes: multiplayer, campaign and zombies.If you are buying this game for the campaign or multiplayer, I would recommend going for a different game such as Call of Duty 4. That game on PC has a much better package for those who like these two features. Regardless, the campaign on this game is phenominal and is worth playing through at least once. Likewise, the multiplayer is good but there are not always a lot of people on. The severs are dedicated, so each server is ran by someone in the world. This means that there is a plethora of custom content added to each server, making the multiplayer both fun and diverse. However, despite all of this, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying this game if you are a zombies fan. You will absolutely not regret it.After 700+ hours and countless maps, this game has brought nothing but enjoyment. It is safe to say that this game is probably the longest lasting and most exciting Call of Duty for PC. While its community is small, the amount of dedication that is put into this game and its custom content is phenominal. There is still content coming out today and each map is filled with mixed emotions, whether it is the sigh of distress from a new box map to the amazement of Black Ops 3-esque level of detail in maps.Looking at where custom maps started until now, we were able to add new perks (from existing Call of Duty titles and from our imaginations), add buildables, add new guns and create a new format for playing zombies. Buyable endings have become a norm, swiftly replacing that of high rounds in order to increase some maps replayability. Comparatively, these easter eggs generally take a day or two to figure out by some, but are extremely satisfying if found by ones self.For those looking for places to find good custom maps:ugx-mods.com (for the newest and latest custom zombie maps)zombiemodding.com (for the largest bank of custom maps)zommods.com (for the generally more popular custom maps)Any other site not mentioned usually overlaps these sites in content.Regardless of your experience in zombies, this game is definitely for the zombies fanatic. All skill levels are met. If you are a hardcore fan, there are plenty of great/difficult custom maps. If you are just learning, or not that good, there are a ton of box maps to begin learning the game on.In my opinion, if you are looking to get: World at War, Black Ops 1, Black Ops 2, Black Ops 3 ----- Get World at War. It's face value is a surpreme bargain. There are at least 1000 maps so it is well worth it over the other zombie games. This opinion may change in the future as Black Ops 1 is slowly gaining steam toward custom maps (it already has some great custom mods though, and in my opinion custom maps is pretty late for that game) and Black Ops 3 is going to be getting mod tools soon for the public. With what has been shown, Black Ops 3 will more than likely become World at War's successor in terms of custom zombies. So look towards purchasing that game once we get some more information. The possibilities will be endless for that game.Overall, I give this game an 7/10 for the vanilla game for PC specifically, (4 zombies maps/Multiplayer/Campaign) because of how many people are online at the moment and what you will be getting for face value.When you take all of the custom content in consideration I would give the game an easy 10/10. Think about it, you would be paying $20 USD, or 10-15 on sale days, for a game with hundreds of custom maps, equating to 1000's of hours of play time. It is a deal you can not pass up on.10/10-UltzZ "

												I remember playing this game back when it first came out, on my ps3. Playing it now on the PC brings me back to the good old days. I would choose this game over Ghosts any day. The Call Of Duty Series is slowly sinking, but this game shall always remain as one of my favorites.			"

												A personal favorite, as well as the last World War 2 FPS of the franchise, I recommend this purchase only if you are interested in Zombies, as that is the last mode this game has to offer. Unless you prefer Multiplayer, which is still very full and plentiful of players and servers, or the campaign, with one of the better stories CoD has to offer. The zombie community started here, and as grown ever brighter since then. The custom zombie maps and mods are extremely well worth it, and a great play with friends.			"

All you have to do is enable anti-cheat, punkbuster in-game and the servers will filter. I do wish there were more active players, but for how old this game is you can't really complain! Also, playing on an Xbox One controller. Super easy to set up and I don't feel tha I am at a disadvanage against keyboard/mouse players.			"

												I originally had this for PS3, but I moved on to the PC version due to the fact that hackers were invading the console versions, unforunately.Although I can't remember the last time I played the campaign online, it's a very enjoyable one with an okay story. It's also fun when playing with friends, too.To me, the multiplayer hasn't changed from the console versions. However, the only 2 things I find different in this version are no hackers and dedicated servers. It's still fun and memorable to play, though.The variety of custom content this game has to offer is mainly the reason why I got this game on PC (I do sometimes play multiplayer and campaign occasionally, though).Custom zombies is by far one of the greatest modes I've ever played, and as time passes by, more custom content keeps getting put in along with fantastic-looking maps.From custom weapons (from other CoD games) and custom game modes to mysterious easter eggs which you can complete (similiar to the ones in BO1 and BO2), I can easily guarantee you that half (if not, most of) the time that you put into this game will mainly be because of custom zombies.If you're a fan of zombie-slaying or if you're just looking for a good CoD game to play, don't miss out on this,			"

												Call of Duty hasn't sat right with me since 4:Modern Warfare, but World at War grabbed me with it's extreme grittiness.What makes World at War so special, is how it portrays World War II. Where as past Call of Duty games had light violence, World at War is the only Call of Duty game to feature full on gibbing, as well as bullet impaction gibbing. This and the chilling and scary atmosphere that is all throught the game, makes this the last modern Call of Duty game I've enjoyed ever.It's Call of Duty, so you shoot opposing soldiers to get to the other end of the map. It's linear, and completely cinematic, but that never really bothered me in this game. World at War is the last WWII Call of Duty game (at least at the moment), and to me it was the last Call of Duty I could enjoy			"

												This game is amazing, i love it.  I wish call of duty would have more world war 2.... But no, they still make call of duty games that take place in like 2058.  The campaign was so fun to play, in one campaign level you get to drive around in a tank and blow up stuff.  Who doesn't love blowing stuff up while driving around in a tank??  The best part about the campaign is that one of the characters, Viktor Reznov is played by Gary Oldman who he's a famous actor in many films such as the Dark Knight or Harry Potter.I tried custom zombies, i see that most custom zombie maps are poorly made (don't ask me to play custom zombies with you.)Overall I like this game, the only call of duty game that is the best, second being the modern warfare trilogy.

												Ah Call of Duty, synonymous with 12 years olds and at least 2 years of our own pent up rage, this isn't going to be an entirely hate driven review, more to the point and not a review of the community that plays it.W@W is the last Call of Duty that features built in mod support, and custom zombies is fantastic and its main feature imo.The campaign is mildly racist and does at times make you want to friendly fire at your AI teammates, if you have played previous games or even current games in the COD series then the campaign is what you are familiar with, nothing outstanding.Who are we kidding though, if you are considering buying this game it's not for campaign, it's either for zombies or multiplayer.Now the multiplayer has two features that COD since W@W has lacked greatly, the ability to decimate your enemy and blow bits of them off, you are rewarded for headshots and using a trench gun can blow off someone's legs. As well as the ability to drive Tanks. The main issue I have with multiplayer is the main issue I have with the few COD games I have played, that is the fact it rewards negative actions, for instance rushing headlong in to a hoard of enemies is possible and winable, and it tries to force you to do so. Hit detection is iffy (downright dogshit at times) and can lead to some issues like shooting people around corners due to the size of their hitbox, however one definite perk to W@W is that unlike later COD games maps are less linear in design although not to a great extent to be fair and there are custom maps for both multiplayer and zombies.Before you decide if you should buy it or not, it is to be noted that Punkbuster anti cheat is no longer supported and there are hackers/modders in fair amounts. You must find download a patch file to override the game in order to play multipler.There is also the issue of the server list not populating for a large number of people so to see servers you have to check gametracker or another such list.As an arcade style game it is not great but not terrible, saved for the most part for its excellent zombie hoard mode.All in all its a decent time but is fairly average in presentation and execution, I would rate it 5/10 for the games multiplayer and campaign. However for zombies its a solid 8/10 due to the customization and actual mod support.			"

												So yeah...The axis powers are at it again....Trying to take over the world.So once again you have to strap on your boots and helmet, pick up your rifle and show those axis powers that you are taking no prisoners.So does Call of Duty live up the its name?Lets find out shall we.Story: 5/10************The story is pretty simple.You are are fighting World War 2 through the eyes of two soldiers. The American soldier Private C. Miller whom fights in the the Pacific War Theater and the Russian soldier Dimitri Petrenko, whom fights on the easten front from Stalingrad to Berlin.There are almost no cliffhangers or plottwists. As I stated at first its mainly about fighting World War II.Graphics: 9/10****************When it comes to the graphics Call of Duty certainly does not dissapoint.It runs on the engine that was used to make Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.Everything looks really photorealistic From the weapons, to landscapes to characters.Its even so detailed, that you can see the small fabric sewings on the cloth.The game is overall darkish at almost all times. This is to portrait the dark and gloomy ambience of the game, which itdoes perfectly. Explosions and water effects are nice done, although I have seen better water effects, they are acceptable. The explosions however are really something to behold. Smoke also looks pretty nice.The reload animations are pretty tight. Now if there is something I have penchant for it is reload styled animations.Something every connoiseur and aficianado of FPS should love. There is nothing more aesthetic than slamming in a new clip and then reload it in a really stylish and bad ♥♥♥♥ way.Sound: 8/10*************The sound department is repleted with amazing sounds.The music goes from classic to more up-beat techno. I especially relished the up-beat soundtrack that plays when youare onboard one of those heavy armed airplanes. Explosion sounds amazing. If you have a good headset or stereo with bass, crank up the volume and feel the power of the explosions. The really makes it more believing and immersive in the game.The gun sounds I am not to fond off. They sound like toy guns and are really not that engaging.The sounds of the germans and japanese soliders is also amazing. Although the germans voices is just a rehash used inCall of Duty 2. The japanese sounds can get a bit vexing, because the most one that you will hear is:""Banzai! Tenno haka banzai!""Last in this I cannot stress enough, get yourself a really good headset. Becaue the music and the sound explosions are amazing. The guns are all right, although again they sound like toy guns.Gameplay: 10/10*******************Now here comes the main core of the the Call of Duty genre.The gameplay really stands out among its predecessors and other shooters for the matter. Not by introducing new gameplay mechanics but by that it is really well made.First of Call of Duty World at War runs really smooth. The gameplay is not clunky, nor is it slow. It runs really smooth.When crouching and ducking, even aiming it runs smooth.Basically its the same as all the other Call of Duty games. Aim your gun, shoot, find cover, through some nades, complet objectives. Its really simple. But so much fund, engaging and immersive.The AI is somewhat okay, although I didnt enounter some instances where they just stood still and took it in the a**** like some dimwitted boffons. The enemies are good at finding cover, flanking you, and force you out of cover by throwing grenades at your position.Some enemy tactics consists of banzaing your position which the japanese soldiers will do offen.Now one of the things what makes Call of Duty World at War are the weapons.In Call of Duty 2 and the other Call of Duty (in my opinion) had lackluster of more powerful weaponry.Take Call of Duty 2 for instance. In that game you basically use 2 guns. Rifles and submachine guns. Rifle or long range,and then submachine guns for close range. Now imagine this. You are gong to clear a bunker. You have 2 choices of weapons. First your rifles, which have way to slow fire rate in close range. Second you have submachineguns, but those guns are to weak to clear a larger group of enemies. You are really craving for the more powerful weapons. Like machineguns, grenade launchers and flamethrowers. Call of Duty 2 did have more powerful weapons, but in all honesty those weapons were *really* scarce.World at War introduces new weponry like the flamethrower and grenadelauncher for Garand and powerful machine guns. Your outload is really diversified, which bothers me to some extent, I mean sometimes you have a bolt action rifle and a pistol, the next you have a machine and a flamethrower. Weird.But as stated earlier more powerful weapons were scarce, well not in World at War. World at War is like Super Mario World for SNES on steroids. The simply throw weapons at you like crazy. Weapons are all over the place. I mean you cannot move more than 30m then you find machineguns and grenade launchers. And thats what I like about World at War. It cuts right through the bulls**** and simply arm you with the best that the game can offer, right from the beginning of game. The really prepare you for the challenges ahead. Its not like in other shooters where you have to earn the guns or buy them were they are super expensive.So that where I think it stands out, because it is not something that i have seen in recent games.Overall: 10/10****************So all in all I give this game a 10 out of 10This is simply a masterpiece of a shooter, when not considering the story.So do i recommend it? Of course with a score of 10/10 and with more than 3000+ hours in that game, I really encourage you to buy it. Every FPS fan should experience this masterpiece of a shooter. "

												Despite having the completely unenviable job of following up CoD4, WaW manages to be pretty decent even if it does not quite match its predecessor's level of quality. Taking the series back to WW2, this game, rather than going to the classic and arguably overused setting of Western Europe (USA/Britain/Canada/etc vs Germany in 1944-45), you instead go to the Ostfront (Germany vs USSR) and the Pacific (USA vs Japan). One thing that is captured really well in this game is the dark and merciless nature of the fighting on these two fronts: you see executions of prisoners and unarmed soldiers trying to surrender (VERY common occurances on these two fronts committed by both sides), and a few times you are even asked to pull the trigger yourself. Ugly, but refreshing too since it ensures that this game isn't just another ""America ♥♥♥♥ Yeah WW2"" game where its good vs evil, but a much more realistic and morally grey experience. The history nut in me liked this little detail enough that this alone would make me recommend this game, if only to get a glimpse of how vicious the war between the Americans and Japanese, and especially the Germans and Soviets, truly was.Honestly though, it's a decent game for shooter fans too and not just crazies like me. Though this is also the game that introduced the Zombie mode to CoD, so that could be a potential turn-off for you. Still, you can have fun with this one.			"

												Immediatley, when I buy any game at gamestop when I made the mistake of a console over a PC, I immediatley looked at the back, and it said ""Flamethrowers"". Of course I was a sellout on it. I loved the game, but couldn't get enough of it. I tried so hard to download custom zombie maps, to try new things. Of course I sucked. When I got this for PC I was amazed at the still alive modding community, the servers of world at war are STILL ONLINE so I can host Co Op Games and invite my friends. Vs the MW2 Servers being shut down. This is a game to get, even after nearly 7 years of it being released. The gameplay is amazing.I mean I think it supports up to 1 million troops. WOW, One million Troops! Extreeemmmeeee.On the other note, if you keep on pressing like the XXX and the YYY and the XXX and the YYY again, you will be sucked. - Tak Fuji, E3It does take some teamwork on nazi zombies, especially custom maps, which I love that are updated and include new perks and weapons made by the impressing modding community itself.

												This game is very different than other Call Of Duty Games. Not liking COD games (a.k.a Black Ops1 and 2 and Ghosts.)  makes me a stinker when it comes to Call Of Duty games. Its not that im bad (im acualy pretty good.) but Treyarch is a TERREBLE  company. but Call Of Duty: World At War, is an eception to my call of duty hatered. treyarch has little to redo or copy from previous games, making it distinguished from COD games.     With revolutionary new Zombies and Mod support, makes this game more popular than any of the new games. Though this game would not be worth $20 without mods. its a semi solid game without them.			"

												I would reccomend World at War only for it's coop campaign or modable zombies. However the Multiplayer is just ♥♥♥♥ing awful (no suprise there) but what makes it even worse is that there is 60 players per server making it a huge cluster ♥♥♥♥, there are high XP servers that enable me to prestige every 40 minutes and I still feel it is taking too long. However the zombies on this game does outway the negatives of the multiplayer because of the ability to download modsI rate World at War 7/10			"

												This was THE Call of Duty game. I don't care about the others. This one was the best. Beware if you buy this:This game is old, therefore, modern PC hardware doesn't run it as well. I've had a lot of trouble with this game, and as a matter of fact, it's starting to crash on me again. The vertical sync is a nightmare in this game, if you turn it off, the game runs like ♥♥♥♥, if you turn it on, the game stutters like ♥♥♥♥. If you own a 120/144hz monitor you'll fair better, but you'll have to mess with the max framerate in the console to get it working properly. As I mentioned before the game does crash from time to time. If you tab out, there is a good likelyhood the game will crash upon tabbing back in, and the only way to exit the crashed game is to sign out of your PC and sign back in.TL;DR-DO NOT buy this game if you hate optimization issues. -DO NOT buy this game for the multiplayer, there is none anymore, or at least nobody playing it.-DO buy this game for the zombies. This game has, hands down, the best zombies mode in all of COD.-DO buy this game if you want some quick WWII action.			"

												Call of Duty: World at War PROS AND CONS==============PROS---------------------- Friendly multiplayer community- Fun zombies, especially custom maps- Intriguing campaign- Never gets old, even after 7 years- Still very populated- Inexpensive WWII simulator- No port forwarding required to host a private server for your friends- Most perks I've seen in a [respectably decent] CoD game---------------------CONS---------------------- Graphics aren't the best- Zombies can get boring after round 15 on about every map- Even though custom zombies maps are fun, they can be difficult to install- Modders/hackers on undedicated servers- Often cracked TDM servers with too much XP- Almost all TDM servers are Hardcore Mode- Little to no public zombies servers- Easy to use cheats on any server (Mostly private, though)==============What would I rate this game?---------------------I would give this game a solid3.5 out of 5 stars.---------------------OTHER COMMENTS---------------------Pretty solid game for 2008.

												The big deal about this game was: Modern Warfare made gamers so spoiled about Call of Duty series that if a game on FPS genre isn't hardcore ground-breaking, it's called ""mediocre"". What? Big Red One was mediocre. Finest Hour was mediocre. NDS versions are mediocre. World at War is a great game. But how much can you improve over WWII? You can't lie on history. Most people can't even describe what else they were expecting from this title. Just stick with Modern Warfare's if you like, the world is big enough for everyone.			"

												Call of Duty World at War is my favorite Call of Duty, I have played all of the Call of Dutys and in my opinion World at War is overall the best one, at least it was when this review was written. Maybe some day there will be a call of duty that I find I like more than World at War but until then, well. If you where going to play a call of duty I would strongly recommend that you at least try World at War. I dont know what it is about the game that makes me feel its the best Call of Duty, but after playing it through you may feel the same.			"

												I Recommend Call of Duty: World at WarPros:1. The Graphics are Great.2. The Weapons and Equiment are realistic3. The characters are Awsome.4. The Storyline is proficient.5. The Zombies Maps are Logical for he story.6. The History is accurate.7. The Bazai charges are surprising and terrffing at times.8. Some actions you do effect the story.9. The story isn't all way's the same, the is something always different depending on the choice you take.10. You can play the campaign with friends online.11. It explores battles that haven't been explored too much.12. The Tank mission is fun.13. The enlightening is lovely.14. The Zombie maps are time freaky and zombie like.15. At times its really surpising.16. The cutscenes are amazing and dramatic.17. Someone in your squad dies very often, so I get more and more challagging.18. The warfootage in the cutscenes are so outstanding.19. The environments look nearly real.20. The characters voices are awsome.21. The game has wartime sadness and ambition in it.22. You can make your own custom zombie maps.23. Its MY Favourite GAME!Cons:1. It needs more missions in Stalingrad.2. More missions in places like Russia, Poland, Saipan, Wake island, Midway, Philippines and more.3. It had more vehicle missions.4. On the tank mission the tank driver is the guy who is fighting in Stalingrad in the infantry, he is a infantryman, not a Tank guy.5. On the plane mission I wish there was more infomation about your character.6. I wish you could be Axis too.7.  That the bots are really dumb.8. I wish it was longer.9. That you can drop the two bombs on Japan.10. I wish you can choose more country to been in then Russia and U.S.A.11. That you can be real heroes of the War.12. That you can do the Western Front.13. That you can upgrade weapons on singleplayer.14. That there were more weapons.15. There should be a mission were you kill Hitler in his bunker.16. All the enemy soldiers look all basely the same, in the country faces that is.17. There are some historical errors.18. The campgain is too short.19. There are no achievements and badges.20. On singleplayer the ranks for your characters don't go up. Overall I liked this game, and I give it 8/10			"

I love the old guns and the dynamic battles that make your adrenaline glands flare and the intensive combat. The multiplayer is great, map dynamic s are awesome and so is the spawning and gun variety. 9/10 for sure.			"

												I first found out about this game when I was addicted to Black Ops 2 zombies. I started watching youtube videos about it and became hooked, I decided to get the game for steam. And I was not disappointed. I knew that in order to play zombies you had to complete campain and the other zombies maps were DLC, but to my suprise they were all there. I tried to play multiplayer, but it's kinda laggy and barely anybody plays. Thats my only problem with that. Overall, I give it a 9.5/10.			"

But Zombies is the only reason I got it.I've always loved CoD Zombies, but with a limit of maps, it gets boring. So I bought PC WaW to play fan-made modded maps, it was honestly the best thing I've ever done. If you enjoy Zombies mode then this PC version is a must!			"

The campain has a nice story with great voice acting along the feeling of imersion of a real WWII battle feild. Multiplayer is also good but hard to 100% master, also there is a LOT of modded servers. But hey that's why I'm level 37 .

												Ahh the rare game that just never seems to die, why? Cause it was bloody brilliant and still is! It may be old, but in many ways the cod of yesteryear is more advanced and more enjoyable than some of today's pathetic offerings we see.No waiting for matchmaking, let alone all the other troubles that come with it, nor reduced player numbers, why? You get server lists (with custom servers) showing ping , oooo, select a server based on ping or players or map...Also tons of free mods and maps to download, you get access to mod tools, free updates / map packs(bk in the day) etc.. yep.... the glory days of COD, before they decided to ♥♥♥♥ all over it's heritage, use and abuse it's good name it had so rightly earned. :*(Quick Zombies review, why ? cause that's all i really care about! xD This game rocks, new maps still get released and are free to download from zombie sites .You can customise game play without fear of bans.Text chat in lobby.Host your own zombie server which appears in server list (port forwarding needed) and admin it.Some even have endings (goals) instead of constant survival, if that takes ya fancy.Custom content from newer cods (weapons etc) are included with some maps.So much more too.Best history lesson ever, go play this and find out for yourself why cod earned such a great name!Buy Buy BuyI think you get the idea, go have fun :PTL:DR The last thing Treyarch did right!

												I love World At War not just because it was amazing for its time but because it allows players to make maps for zombies which makes it 300 times better then any other zombie call of duty. I wish theyd remaster it because that would make the call of duty community explode!			"

												I'd recommend you buy this game if you're into the cod zombie mode or really like the style of older cod campaigns.I wouldn't recommend it if you only want it for the mp mode since it's still alive, but it's not that good of a mp experience in my opinion.When it comes to custom zombie maps, there are plenty of maps to download with a lot of them being very well made.The only thing that is a bummer are the technical limitations of w@w, with some maps having weirdly fading out shadows, model/texture quality pop-ins and so on. It's not annoying, but noticable.Besides that, it's your basic game/shooter from a decade ago I guess. Graphics compared to newer games are weak, but other stuff like controls and sound is fine.It's not worth 20 bucks if you're planning to only play the campaign or only a few hours of custom zombies if you ask me.I'd recommend you wait for a sale, unless you are planning to spend a lot of hours on it and it's worth it to you.

												My favourite Call of duty game. I probally am saying this out of nostalgia because it was my first call of duty game. I originally owned this on the xbox 360 and when i bought it on pc the nostalgia came back to me. It is enhanced on PC in so many ways. Mods like custom zombie maps add an endless amount of fun and the base game alone is stunning. Campaign: The campaign is simply amazing'. You play as two different soldiers in two different armies. You play as an American soldier in the Royal Marines who is fighting the Japanese, and a Russian soldier fighting the Germans all the way from the siege of Starlingrad to the fall of Berlin. Multiplayer: The Multiplayer provides a ton of fun including drivable tanks with some amazing maps and weapons. You also get all the map packs for free on PC which saves you about £40. Nazi Zombies: One of the best game modes of all time. The Zombie maps on this are amazing with a gritty and survival like atmosphere.Overall i highly reconmend this game.			"

												I played this game on PS3 and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this is my favorite Call of Duty, maybe even the best one overall. I got this game just two days ago and have put in about 12 hours at the time of writing this review. The game still looks good today if you can crank up the graphics. Multiplayer isn't dead, but be careful. Some servers automatically download stuff to your computer, if this happens just backout of the game and join a different server. The singleplayer is excellent, and while it is just another run of the mill WWII singleplayer it manages to feel like much more than that. Zombies is the whole reason I got this game, The main maps are a blast and all of them are unlocked from the start, no need to buy them. Custom zombies adds unlimited amounts of replayability, and I never get bored of seeing what people can create with the mod tools in this game. The game deserves all of the praise that it recieves and I would've paid triple what I paid still been happy. But don't tell Activision that, because you know they start charging that.10/10 - Would give Activision more money.			"
