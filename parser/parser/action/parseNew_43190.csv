												""Hidden Gem"" is the only word I can describe this game.The game itself seems to be a little dated, however, the fun is not.Here's what I thoughtGraphics and FXsIt is surprisingly good. Characters are well-designed. There are several type of enemies as well as their variations. However, I feel that it could be better if they added some different models for the same enemy, to keep things interesting for the whole round.Gore FX, imho, is better in certain situation compared to newer games with next-gen gore system. As it stands, it serves the game too well. (can be a little too much at times)Maps are good, seriously, there are better than many newer games of similar theme. There are many neat details that will make you go ""WOW"", again, maps are good. ;DGameplaySimple concepts, excellent executions. The game seems to design for soloing, but somehow, they make it so that you have to work together. A competitive co-op kind of gameplay, but encourages playing together.This game describes the word 'challenging' very well. It is not hard, but challenging. You will be occupied for the whole round. It is intense, to the point that it might not be suitable for casual players.Weapons are balanced, imho. They make it so that your starting gear can do something in late round. They are put into 4 categories, Melee / Pistol / Shotty / Machinegun. You get new weapons by upgrading, and each upgrade is really something, not just hit harder. Upgardes are performance-related imo.As soon as you jump into the round, start shooting, meleeing. I am honest that you will start thinking of Resident Evil. (especially 4, and the laters) I personally think that ___COM should make their several latest REs' controls similar to this, rather than the awkward controls as they tried to maintain stop and aim from older tittles.Anyway, actual gameplay can explain better than words:

Swarms from HELL ! !Man this game kinda blew me away a bit lol I was expecting not so much being i got it on sale for a buck something but then i played it and man its a pretty good game and i can see why they Won the Make Something Unreal Contest a few years back.The Game is very much like Killing Floor or God Mode if you played them. Pretty much kill as many demons as you can and stay alive lol The game has 2 game modes Inferno and Survival. The games gfx are pretty sweet being it does run on the Unreal 3 engine and maps are real nice and big and look pretty sweet also. They have a nice slection of weapons and explosives to help power you up and blow threw the Demon Hoards. The Models are pretty good looking also and they have some pretty good animations. I Love blasting Demons across the map with a Sawed off Shotgun lol The Multiplayer is a little dead at the moment but the Single Player is still fun and keeps you busy. I also Read they are about to add a DLC soon once its done . The price is pretty good for what they are asking but if on sale this is a must buy for some pretty good game play ! Enjoy your stay in Hell :)			"

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.The Haunted: Hells Reach is a sorta hard game to nail down. In describing it ""It is sorta like Killing Floor..but with more of a Resident Evil 4/5 The Mercenaries 3rd person perspective and execution style melee with fast action.Make no mistake, Hells Reach is a simple, straight-forward, zombie wave survival game in the same vein as titles like killing.Overall: If you're a fan of 3rd person action shooters with the great melee that gives you a good challenge, this is your game. The devs are Very active on the Steam forums. They have plans for plenty of free updates and continuing DLC. The game is also only $20. Do the math. It equals fun.			"

												This is just a simple run and gun shoot em or smack them ( with melee weapon ) video game.That's basically it and nothing else.Which is not putting this game down in any way, but if your looking for something with more depth or storyto it then I can only suggest look for something else.Here there is no crafting of weapons, rpg elements, leveling up of characters, mission oriented goals or anything else of interest.It's just shoot to kill, then run and survive as long as you can.If you want action without anything else then this is the game for you.Otherwise look for something more challenging in other ways.

THE BITESIZE:SIMILAR GAMEPLAY TO: Killing Floor, other wave survival shooters.WHAT TO EXPECT: Four modes inc. survival coop, pvp and variants.  Hell/Demonic themes.  Shooter & melee combat.  Simple dynamics:  Kill. Survive. Stop 'Hell' from raging enemies.  Decent graphics starting to show their age.  Underrated gameplay.  ACHIEVEMENTS: FAIRLY EASY but a few are grindy. STATUS: ABOUT TO BE REVIVED. New DLC planned. Almost dead community.WHEN TO BUY:  ON SALE.More info below....THE LOWDOWN:The Haunted: Hells Reach is a third-person, wave/survival shooter set in demonic themed reality set in a western-style backdrop.  The objective is simple: join the side of good (or evil.) Shoot, punch, kick and blast numerous demonic minions across five or so waves (depending on the mode) Defeat the great hulking demon Adadon in the final battle.  Overall the game possesses a Painkiller aesthetic with a Killing Floor feel.KEY FEATURES: Solo, coop or pvp modes. Six or so large maps of different locations. Several game modes inc: Inferno (wave survival) and Survival (endless), Battle (pvp). Four unique, well-voiced characters. Three core weapons (handguns, shotguns, rifles) with six upgraded models. Numerous special weapons and grenade types littered around levels. Collect soulstones in quick-time to stop enemies entering a rage mode.   Various demonic minion types with their own abilities, attacks and deadly rage mode.THE GOOD:+ V. good and stable netcode with listen server mode.+ Nice designed and streamlined gameplay makes for a very fun game.+ Weapon classes maybe limited to three but the upgrades are very different and satifying to use.  Upgrading is so well ingraved in the action that choosing which weapons to upgrade is done on the fly.+ Very well conceived achievements.  Only one grinding achievement and a two tricky but easy to get achievements.  Overall very satisfying to unlock for achievement unhunters/completionists.+ Good range of difficulty levels from: Beginner to Nightmare, provides an excellent learning curve.THE BAD:- Enemies are quite fast and will be upon you on harder levels before you can react.  Giving the impression of getting overwhelmed quickly.  Put me off playing at first.- Spawn frequency doesnt seem to be that well geared towards difficulty- Dead community.  Although there are a very few die hards from time to time you will struggle to get anyone to join your game or find one on going.  Which is a real shame!- The games heavy demonic theme may put you off if thats not your cup-of-tea.- Doesnt scale to well with more players.AND THE ORDINARY:* A really nice selection of game modes including: wave survival, versus (pvp) and a mix of both allow for some change-up when you feel the need.* Well-rounded characters with good one-liners and _ voice-overs.* While the graphics maybe dated by todays standard they held up very well and immerse players in the setting.* The use of soulstones to keep players on their toes is a nice touch.  Fail to get these before time runs out and the pace, franticness increases.  Includes some nice environmental changes to penalise the player some more.* An average soundtrack which switches from one track to a second when gameplay changes normal pace to * Its a port with console style gameplay moves and controls.  But its a decent one and it works well on PC at all levels.VERDICT:Dropped like a hot potato when first played, I really did not take to Haunted: Hells Reach.  I found the game slow, difficult and frustating.  Nothing made sense.  After a few years gathering dust I decided to give this another try.  Suffice to say I was really glad I did!By starting on easier difficulty and learning the game's mechanics, I really enjoyed my experience during this second pass.  Graphics may become dated but for the time being they hold their own.  Game mechanics are concise and robust, making for fluid gameplay.  Sure its very repetitive and at times five waves seem a little long but despite these its alot of fun.  The combination of destroying soulstones within the time limit and weapon upgrading work well keeping you invested in playing. The range of enemies require some tactics especially when they enter rage mode, increasing the challenge to a satisfying level.  Probably one of the highlights are the range of characters and the very apt one-liners they spit out as you slaughter the devils minions!Potential downsides are the slightly clunky controls and 'on-top of you' enemy spawning which together, can cause premature death!  The Haunted plays fine in solo but is much better fun with other players.  PvP where players can choose to play on the side of good or control the evil minions could actually have been very good!  Its just a shame that there is no community to speak of anymore.  Overall its actually far better than I had originally thought.  If youre looking for an ultimate challenge from a coop wave survival shooter, you cant get much harder than on Nightmare.   Despite its age its a very underrated title.  One I would recommended mostly on a decent sale.  Be aware that now that its under new ownership the brand looks about to be re-vitalized.   At least with a new dlc.			"

												It is a shame that there was so much hate for this game, because in my opinion it is beyond great. It's very simple, but insanely fun. You versus the demons of hell; a great combination. You and three others must tackle down the enemies wave by wave until you reach the depths of hell and fight a boss. It is a great challenge and an awesome time. My favorite aspect about this game is how awesome each melee strike and attack is. You have a surprisingly large amount of melee attacks and each will cause you to be showered in a pool of blood and limbs. But beyond that are the upgraded versions of your starting pistol, SMG, and shotgun. Oh, and the knife as well. Each new upgrade gets crazier, more powerful, and enhances the gore. And there is also a nice variety in maps, too. Each one feels different and will require a different setup plan. AS for bugs, well,  I have not encountered any bugs. It runs really smoothly for me as well. To me it's pretty polished. It also looks beautiful.  At its full price it is steep, seeing as how many don't play this game anymore, but if it's on sale I would highly recommend getting it.			"

												By default the game is a little janky but with some tweaks of the FOV and other stuff it runs pretty well. These tweaks can only be edited in the Ini file not in game though this may change in the revival DLC update.Its a fun run and gun arena shooter survival game where you are rewarded for moving around constantly and not finding places to hold up and camp. The player is kind of a glass cannon you are extremely powerful and can mow through hoards of demons but you can also get killed fairly easily if you get surounded or camp in a spot for too long. The game will send more and more powerfull enemies at you if you camp too long.basic gameplay in the normal mode kind of plays like killing floor where there are 4 rounds of demons that get difficult as the wave goes on and one round where you go up against the boss of the underworld ""Abadon""At the time of writing this there is still a revival DLC that is in development to keep the game alive. The devs are trying to scrape themselves back together after the publisher THQ went under because of Homefront.			"

												The Haunted Hells Reach is a third person action horror cooperative game. The goal is to liberate cursed places and survive the assault from the minions of Hell.Four game modes are offered: Survival, Battle, Demonizer and Inferno. Each mode can be played on any of The Haunted’s eight maps. Survival simply makes you keep fighting until you die, which is not a particularly engaging objective, while Battle and Demonizer are The Haunted’s efforts at player-versus-player modes. In Inferno, which is the best mode of the game, four players must survive four waves of enemies that increase in number and power over time before fighting Abaddon, a huge boss monster in a separate Hell level.  The player is equiped with a handgun, shotgun, machine gun and knife. You will unlock upgrades to these as you kill.The game has also a deep melee system that gives the player an easy way out when surrounded by undead.Unfortunately, networking issues can make locating or connecting to someone’s game difficult. The biggest problem of The Haunted Hells Reach is that joining a game forces you to wait until the next wave of enemies, which can sometimes be 10+ minutes until you can finally play.in my opinion, if you are seeking a new, unique team-based game to play with some friends, The Haunted Hells Reach is a worthy choice.Sounds 6/10Graphics 6/10Gameplay 7/10Atmosphere 7/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Imagine, for a second, that you are a crazy person. For some this won't be such a strech. Now imagine that as you are going about your day carrying your crazy man guns when hell decides to attack everything. As the nearest crazy person it is up to you to send them to super hell (which is, incidentally, next to Ragusa Hell). Either with knives, guns, or fist of fury, you murder your way through a gallery of monster. Dismembering them in sprays of gore or, if you have reduced gore on, explosions. It's like Michael Bay directed Night of the Living Dead, only with more Michael Jackson zombies and kung-fu.			"

												Personally, I find this so much more fun than Killing Floor 2. Though the game is old, it still has decent graphics (Unreal Engine 3) and just has a good feel to the movement/guns. It reminds me a little of Serious Sam meets Killing Floor. I have not tried the Vs mode yet, but am enjoying the 'horde' mode. I like the fact that it is not just an endless horde mode (though it appears you can choose that if you like), but instead as a small form of progression to give you something to strive for.At the current sale price ($2.24) it seems like an easy decision.

The gameplay is fun and easy to learn, the action is intense and just from the little I've played so far it is one of the best shooters ever because of how fluid the combat is . It feels like a long lost cousin of Painkiller, who was raised by Resident Evil and God Mode.I wish can add something about the multiplayer, but there aren't too many servers available at the time and even fewer players on. I still recommend it just for the solo experience and after ya get tired of it try talking a friend into joining you for a great blast. IT'S WORTH A BUY. "

												This is actually pretty fkn fun.  Monster design is freaky, comes with lots of variety and I love how fast and in-your-face they are.  The character controller is surprisingly good.  Granted, animations aren't fluid or 3A industry standards but play really well with the game.  Gun control, combat control and jumping is very responsive and satisfying and has a bit of parkour going with it, which is great.  For a ""yo, lets play something quick"" co-op game, this is perf.  Worth it for the sale price, honestly.  I'm glad I got it.EDIT: After a bit more playing, this game is seriously good.  Really hard.  Might be the hardest shooter I ever played for coop survival.  Harder then Killing Floor 2 on HoE and that's even on NORMAL difficulty!  Take that in!  I know you don't believe me because you don't know my level of skill, but I can 'zerk in KF2 on HoE solo with 100% success rate at this point.  The community says ""Normal"" is an untested difficulty...and it has +2 more difficulties above normal.  I barely beat normal.The combat mechanics are fantastic.  It's damn near cartoony over-the-top holywood, but, the mechanics play out very well.  Melee and unarmed combos mix up well with ranged attacks and level up your inventory.  You can prioritize which weapons to upgrade.Certain monsters are immune to ranged when enraged (when u fail to finish them off during their stun period) and thus hafta be taken care of in close combat.  If you have someone prioritizing close combat/melee then they can go in and assassinate raged enemies before it gets out of hand.When a player dies a totem spawns with player's soul that must be touched to respawn them;  However, a monster can steal the soul and run away, getting lost in horde, forcing co-op team to risk going after it.  Health totems spawn and hafta be dealt with in same way.  Really cool mechanic and clutch for such a steep difficulty curve.  It's very satisfying getting combos off as each enemy kill regens ur health (but less and less on higher difficulties).They made this game long time ago for a contest, then refined it and fixed the bugs.  It was worth the effort, very unique co-op survival game.  I'm buying copies for lan and online parties since its fun and easy to get into but hard to master.			"

												This is your generic type of humans versus waves of zombies/monsters type scenario. It isn't very special, but it is definitely something good to come back to every once in awhile. This is a third person shooter and it has a nice variety of weapons. You can upgrade your weapon for it to level up to the next tier. The tier system is, however, opinionated on which is better or worse. Regardless, it's a nice take  on a weapon system. The monsters are demons, which has a variety of types out there. you'll have the generic not zombie but still cannon fodder like a zombie type monster, then you got the generic winged demon. You got the big orc like guys and then you got these weird tiny bug like things. The diversity is good. There is a type of giant demon that eventually becomes immune to gun damage, whom encourages melee combat since that's the only way to kill it. Speaking of melee combat, you have not just the primary weapons or sidearms, but also a melee weapon with different melee attacks like kicking. You probably will not use them all a whole lot, but it's still a worthy try in variety that I wish more games would have. (I miss kicking in games greatly)When you finish the waves, you eventually fight the final boss. The final boss feels cheap at first, but it's possible with practice. It basically is a giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a demon that walks around in lava, throwing lava♥♥♥♥♥♥at you, all the meanwhile the immune to gun damage guys spawn all over the place trying to attack you while bursts of lava comes out of the ground. It is a climatic ending and it was climatic at first, but it gets old after awhile... like the game itself.As I have said before, the game is something you'll wanna come back to every once in awhile, especially with friends. Its graphics are good and so is the lighting, not amazing but good enough, the sound is what you'd want, the characters are kinda over the top in personality like a bad horror movie- which is a good thing - and their design is nice. There is a variety of game modes, one of which you can play in a strategy game like perspective and spawn enemies or even choose to play as the enemy yourself. It isn't that fun in my opinion to be the bad guys because you'll die so quickly and you have a spawn timer on when you can spawn more enemies, which might be good for balance and fairness for the humans but it makes you feel bored just sitting there pressing the button over and over again... even cookie clicker is more fun than that. There is a survival mode as well, it's as you'd expect and it's fun as well.Overall, the game is good. I wouldn't buy it full price, I would consider buying it on sale for around $5. Apparently the developers are hinting something is afoot with the title. We'll see what that means and I'll edit my review accordingly if it any way changes my overall opinion. For now, this is a good bargin title, don't buy it at full price.Pros:A good enough variety in enemies and weaponsLighting and atmosphere is niceGameplay is fun for beginners and veterans alikeA healthy amount of gamemodesCons:Not many hours should be expected to be put in this right away, but it is something you could launch for years to come in every five or so months. This game will get stale pretty quick.The combat seems unbalanced, you could spam some moves and do just fineOverall, I give it a score of a 6ish/10. For people that are unfamiliar with rating scales, 6 isn't bad.			"

												Awesome graphics, enough variety in enemies, fun melee combat, sliding ability, cool weapons that upgrade and are noticeably better when upgraded and much more stuff make The Haunted: Hell's Reach a really enjoyable game. So glad I found this on my Steam list of games today when I was just waiting around for a person to show up to buy a hard drive from me. I needed something to do and when I saw the name to this game I was like this has to be something I like. Funny that I never even noticed this shooter on my list before and thank goodness I finally did because it is the type of game that is easy to pick up and play and have fun with if you like shooters with constant action in it and have it not be the usual games people play these days which are war shooters. I also have to say this definitely is a game for Halloween.  It has that intense and somewhat spooky aspect to it especially when you get to the boss battle for the first time and are not knowing what you should do. LOL!			"

												Amazing monster design, layered level design, satisfyingly brutal, even if amateurish, gameplay, with all the B-Movie cheese one could ever want, all for less than a nice pizza. Even if the game is somewhat lacking in terms of quantity, this is a solid venture for a dev team birthed from a relatively niche mod. If the devs truly are back to working on this game, as some recent announcement posts would have one believe, then I cannot wait. This is truly a hidden gem, even if it comes off as somewhat amateur or cheap. There is a reason I have 12+ hours in this game on Steam, and probably at least a dozen from the mod as well.			"

												superior in many respects to many of it's modern competitors like killing floor 2, for instance.the graphics are as good as any that we've seen on ur3. fast-paced, non-stop action, tons of blood and gibs and a melee combo system that will cause or aggravate your carpal tunnel syndrome symtoms. that is the only problem i have with this game is that it is physically demanding to play; i would have certainly logged more hours if not for that. a couple of hours of melee combos will have your wrist screaming for morphine. other than that it's very good and unique co-op action game. the developers abandoned it years ago but the game's shortcomings are few. it's a lot of game for the money, especially when it's on discount.

												This game has likely flown under the radar of practically everyone here on Steam, and that is somewhat of a shame.The Haunted Hells Reach is a horde based wave shooter in which you play as four stereotypical badasses with no difference other than how corny their lines in combat are. You face wave after wave of the undead as you fight to survive with an ugradable arsenal of Knife, Shotgun, Machine Gun, and pistol. Each weapon has it's own upgrade tree, with the knife becoming a chainsaw at somepoint whilst your pistol becomes two revolvers. Along with this, you can pick up several other exotic weapons like a bow with explosives or a rocket launcher. You can also find explosives such as grenades and mines as well.The online community at this point is dead in the water for this game, a shame since it is best enjoyed online. However physical copies of the game exist and for as little as a dollar, it's utterly worth it in my opinion. The more players, the more challenging the game becomes. And there is even a mode in which you can play as the demons in an effort to murder your friends.The graphics are decent enough, servicable if you will, the animations aren't awful, and the textures for the environments are solid enough, though you don't have much time to admire because enemies come from everywhere.Luckily, enemies rarely become all aggressive, which makes the game a hell (HA!) of a lot better. If you have some friends then this game will be an enjoyable time of 8/10.However if horde based games aren't your thing then perhaps Doom might be more your speed.			"

Visuals, level design and dynamic effects are impressive. This game drop's you right into action and leaves all the boring stuff out. Don't expect a long drawn out story with loads of dialogue and character development. If that's what you want look elsewhere. Do you like a challenging shooter/survival game that has you frantically shooting and dodging demons? This game was created for people like you!			"

												This game was an unexpected gem. Anyone who likes DOOM or going FAST will like this game. Me, personally? I'm a sucker for games like this. All of the guns feel powerful which should be a thing in more games, the graphics are pretty great for an indie game, the blood and gore make the game look pretty cool, and the game is just overall really fun.My complaints with the game lie in a lack of content for it. It was so fun that there's not enough maps for it. Luckily i think you can download user created maps to play on, but those are limited as well. Plus, the community is pretty much dead as a doorknob, unfortunately. Still, if you're a fan of survival/horde mode games, you owe it to yourself to get this. It may not have a lot of lasting appeal to some, but hot damn is it fun to play.  "

There's only a few guns (pistol, AR, and shotgun) but you can upgrade each like 5 or 6 times and each time they get better and cooler. Its a fun game to sit and play and laugh at especially if you can find a match online. You probably won't though because nobody plays this.6.5/10 fun for a few hours			"

												This is definitely a unknown and severely underestimated gem.It's nothing terribly fance. Just a very action-packed, quick and arcade-y 'kill everything before it kills you' type arena survival shooter. The gameplay itself consist of a mix of gunplay and melee action, combined with tons of explosives (and explosions) and a life-saving dodge mechanic.If you like L4D or Killing Floor, but feel that both those games have slow player characters and are not action-heavy enough, give Haunted a try.Be warned though, Haunted is definitely on a higher difficulty level then any of the two compared games. Whilst on the lowest of the 5 difficulty grades you might easily survive the first of the four waves, the later ones will usually kill you on your first attempt, with suicidal green-goo spitting maniacs, walking volcanos and Freddy-style nightmare warriors. And if we start about the highest difficulty level... boy... imagine L4D expert realism with 80% of all infected being special infected :PThe pros of Haunted are clear: Solid gameplay, tons of action and reflex-based thinking, mixed with a solid note of badassery.However, I must be fair and mention it's downsides too: There is no character progression, any weapon upgrades you gather in a match are reverted at the end of a level. As well, there's literally no online playerbase for this game. This really isn't a bad thing and I enjoy it a lot in singleplayer, but if you are the coop only type of person, you may want to bring some friends. Lastly, it lacks diversity and is one of those games you just cant play 8 hours in a row or you will grow bored.Overall, Haunted is one of my longest-active games, simply because it's always fun to relax with techno/speedcore battle music via winampw hilst playing a round or two on Nightmare difficulty. Whenever I feel like blowing faces up, I just grab winamp, Haunted, and splode away.Rating: 8/10			"

												Real talk: The original mod of The Haunted kept Unreal Tournament 3 installed on my hard drive long after I gave up on the single-player campaign of the original game, because I could always come back to The Haunted for a quick shoot-em-up session. With the full version, not a lot has really changed for the better: What started as a fun little knock-off of Resident Evil's Mercenaries mode is now a kind of boring and listless arcade shooter that plays stiffly and doesn't meaningfully iterate or reinvent on either the original or its inspiration. If you're curious, just download the original mod instead. You'll thank me later.			"

												   Not a bad game, not a good one either.   Pros   - Fast, action packed   - Great balance of weapons and melee combat that would give Chuck Norris a run for his money   - Quite a few zombie types but who cares when you're stomping it to death.   - 3 game modes   Cons   - ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ difficulty. Begginer feels like Hard on other games.   - Not the looks of a 2011 game but the Cons outweigh this issue   If you want a zombie game outside Killing Floor and L4D I'd say give it a shot.			"

												This is the single best arena shooter and best zombie shooter (fps) I have played to date. Beats all of the competition by a mile.Great looks, great feel (gun play, running, even enemy hits are not as annoying as in other games). Gives you options, weapon upgrades, additional unupgradeable weapons. Quite a few maps each with some special mechanic.Sadly I came to the party late and it's not that easy to find people to play with.			"

												A great enjoynable game to kill time, The Haunted: Hells Reach provides us with 10 maps to slaghter hell minions and 4 different characters. Also very big collection of different weapons divided in 4 sections:Pistols,shotguns,assault rifles,and Special weapons hidden in different areas of maps and they can also be upraded when you rack up kills. Also players are able to do some Hand-to-Hand combat which is kinda cool. And finally 4 player coop makes game even better. So go grab it and beat a hell of them.			"

												A multiplayer game with no online players however it does offer a very slow and boring single player option. Basically you complete 4 easy waves that take about 20minutes each followed by a much much much more difficulty final boss. Game doesnt offer very much compared to other battle shooters avaialble and with no player base i really cant recommend it which sucks because i would of loved to have played this on a full server, im sure it would be much more enjoyable if other people actually played it.

												I enjoyed the game despite the bugs, underdeveloped and teleporting zombie issue. Now for the main reason why I don't recommend the game is because its dead, on January of 2016 the developers stated they had legal issue which prevented them from developing this game during its release date of 2011 and now they're back to finish the job with a dlc etc... The community and I heard nothing since that annoucement was made, which made us wonder if there was really any intention to revive the game.  No reply was given with questions on the discussion board, I think somebody emailed them and still no answer. I believe I bought the game in 2015 for $3, I found 1 servers  being occupied by 2 or 3 other people during that time but as of right now I only play with one person that I added from the discussion board which is rare. You can purchase it, add me and some other people from the discussion board to play it but it won't be often.  "

												This game has been quite the mix of feelings for me. On the one hand it's good for some laughs, the weapons get progressivly more awesome the more you upgrade them and the Demonizer gamemode is pretty cool when you want to just be a giant jerk and summon minions on your former teammates should you die or kill yourself (much like I do just to summon junk). On the other hand, the laughs start to fade after about 15 minutes, it's very repetitive and the game knows exactly when and where to become an absolutly evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about everything.This game heavily focuses on teamwork (Teamwork being the key word) and at times, almost demands you to play with others as opposed with playing solo which would be ok if it wasn't for the fact that:1. playing on your own is both boring and tedious and 2. there's no one to help you whatsoever should things go wrong and odds are, they probably will. That's not to say that playing solo is entirely bad. If that's your thing, you go right ahead and do it, but be prepared for a letdown the further in you go. That being said however, this game actually gets fun the more friends you play it with (God knows how many times I've laughed with each Character's catchphrases like a madman since I like each of them and their dialogs) and allows you to keep playing for longer without that droning feeling. Unfortunatly, that requires 4 seperate friends with 4 seperate copies who may not even want to get this in the first place, so shelling up for a 4-Pack to enjoy this game starts feeling like less of a choice and more of a demand.As for Characters, I do like them all as I've said before. Each one comes with ""kill phrases"" that they blurt out everytime they gib a demon or pick up something very deadly to use.All in all, for the current price it is (Note: this was written at the time the price dropped by 75% in the Autumn 2013 sales), it's good for some laughs, some fun and messing around in general. For the full price? I'm sorry but that's asking for too much for what this is.Buy this only if you really want it and it's on offer, simply put.			"

												It's literally just a Killing Floor ripoff, which isn't always a bad thing. Problem is killing floor has a player base, as well as mod support. This has 8 levels and is 100% dead. So this means playing by yourself against terrible AI bots. The levels are big, with good verticality. The movement is good, with jump/slide/melee and other components. Graphics and damage modeling are decent. Problem is the gameplay. You play 4 waves, each which take like 10 min and way too long. The ai just spawns guys right next to you that run straight at you, stand there, or get stuck on objects. Most of the guys look the same, and later guys are previous guys with more armor or an extra weapon. Each character uses the same gun, of which there are 3, and you slowly upgrade to a better version with no new firing. Ammo you just randomly get from guys when game decides to drop it, which can be right when youve run out of all weapon ammo. I did find like 3 extra weapons in 8 total levels so I don't know how that works but dont expect to pick any up. Theres random time things you destroy for no specific reason. Then you get to the final boss, who for some reason isn't explained how you hurt him and on beginner difficulty can kill you in 3 seconds of 1 attack. The game is just super boring, repetitive, terrible difficulty curves, and not much fun, especially by yourself. Even though there are multiple levels you'll be doing the same thing and there's no real reason to play more than 1.   5/10.			"

All the enemies are mostly clones of eachother with different effects or abilities and the difficulty is non existent, the mobs litterally feel like target dummies. The gameplay was alright and it did look ok, so it might be worth owning if you hated the other 400+ good zombie/survival/4 player co-op games on Steam or just wanted something different, stay away unless you watch some YouTube videos first and know that it'll tickle your fancy.

												Long, long ago, i played this game once. There was a clan-server, on which three of its members lived happily...But then I came onto the server...Even though they already played for like ten minutes, i quickly went first place. Something they had a hard time to handle.At one point, i could hear one of them complaining over voice chat: ""He´s always attacking me with grenades""Bad attempt, considering i cant remember this game having friendly fire. I wasnt attacking him, but the enemys around him.Later, i could enjoy the sight of them throwing explosives at me, doing no damage whatsoever.Their rage became undeniable, when we reached the ""Mine""-Map. If a player dies in this game, he ""respawns"" in form of a crystal. The other players must destroy this crystal in order to bring the dead teammate back.When i died, they ignored my crystal... For several minutes... It appears they tried to get rid of me that way, hoping that i´d quit, since they apparently had no kicking-power... But i didnt.But thanks to divine justice, their plan was condemned to fail. You see, when a players crystal isnt destroyed fast enough, a enemy NPC will pick them up. These NPCs then stop attacking and run around on the map, on hardcoded routes.On the Mine-Map, this route is bugged. Sooner or later, the NPC will jump down a hole and land in a lava-pit, thus killing himself and destroying the crystal.Thus i came back to live and ruined the clan-members game once again with my skill.Finally, the time had come for the final battle. Time for us four to face Abaddon. One by one they fell like unskilled scrubs, until only i was left.Unlike them, i wasnt a childish little ♥♥♥♥♥ and would have brought them back a.s.a.p but divine justice struck again:In the final battle against Abaddon, there is no revival. Once a player dies, he stays dead.Thus the three little scrubs had no chance but to spectate me being better than them. Alone, this battle used up alot of time, since i had to fight the boss while dealing with all the mobs.But i wasnt giving up, i kept fighting and Abaddons health kept going down. After about ten minutes of watching me, hoping that i´d fail, the first clan-♥♥♥♥♥ couldnt take it anymore and left the server. For a brief second his voice-chat symbol showed up, he was telling his teammates something. Surely it was something like ""Guys just leave, he´ll die soon anyway"".The second followed quickly after that, while the third one stayed for another five minutes, desperately trying to find an explenation that could explain why he and his friends didnt make it longer than five minutes, while i just kept fighting, surviving everything Abaddon threw at me.Finally, he also left, bailing out in shame probably thinking i would die soon. But i didnt. Yet another ten minutes later, i dealt the final blow to Abaddon, beating the boss and winning the game.When i bought this game it was like what? 10€? Yeah, money well spent!			"

												Aww man this game showed alot of potential but in the end it kinda fell short. The actual game play is fun but its lacking in direction if there was some kind of story mode and maybe some real movies/cutscenes it would have been much better but alas this is more of a multiplayer shoot to score kinda of game. One of the biggest flaws is the online is very consolised and dumbed down also the community seems dead which is quite a shame.			"

												Zombie shooters have become the generic genre for games that World War II was in the 90's and the millennial shift. Some titles are really good, some not so much. The Haunted is not one of the top-players, the competition of undead is far to tough for that. But it does have something the others don't have; that gritty bloody realistic ""Omph!"" factor. In this age of zombified inflation, we still kind of want to be reminded of the fact that when you kill a zombie it's supposed to sound and look bloody and it's gotta hurt, in other words: bring on the guts and glory! That's what Haunted does well; walk up to a zombie/undead/dude from another dead dimension with a shotgun or even a mace in hand and you can feel the punch! And oh yeah, don't mind the bloodspatter on your screen, it'll wipe right of. So even if the game is more repetitive that Left 4 Dead and not as story-driven as Dead Island, those kills..they kinda make it all worth it.			"

												The Haunted: Hells Reach is a fast-paced survival fps made in Unreal Engine 3. You fight massive waves of enemies in a Killing floor-esque style of gameplay but in Hells Reach it feels a lot harder because enemies move faster and some have special abilities to help bring you down. In Killing Floor you often hunker down with your teammates in a choke point while in The Haunted: Hells Reach doing so normally means you all die. Sticking together & constantly moving is the key to winning here. Seperating from your team is basically suicide in the later stages when the waves have more unit variety & more aggressive enemies. There's 12 weapons and 6 types of explosives. Each time you kill an enemy with a weapon that weapon gains experience. Each weapon can be upgraded five times and for each time you upgrade it, it changes. For example; the handgun turns into the burst pistol, vendetta revolver, akimbo handguns, akimbo burst pistols and lastly akimbo vendetta revolvers. Depending on what type of enemies you will encounter on a map it will pay off upgrading a certain weapon that you know is effective against said enemy. The ammo is limited so you have to make each shot count. Enemies will drop new ammo at random. There is 8 maps, 9 if you count the boss level. Each map has a nice design and special layout that enables different tactics to defeat the waves of enemies you encounter. The maps each have special weather events that make it harder to survive. On Forsaken Canyon there's a thunderstorm for example. It obstructs your sight and random thunderbolts hit the ground. If you get hit you get stunned for a short time. During the time of the thunderstorm you should try to stay away from open areas - which makes it a lot harder to survive against some enemies. There's 10 different types of enemy minions & 4 player controlled characters in the game - Caleb, Bruce, Hector & Jacob. In multiplayer they get chosen at random & they do not have any individual special abilities. In my personal opinion I think that this was a really fun game to play cooperatively with friends. It's extremely actionpacked & brutal. Like most games in this genre it does get repetative and dull after a while but if you & your friends are looking for a game to play together for a few nights then I'd definitely recommend it. Is it worth the current price of 15€ though? 10€ perhaps. Wait for it to be on sale.			"

Like most games in this genre it does get repetative and dull after a while but if you & your friends are looking for a game to play together for a few nights then I'd definitely recommend it. Is it worth the current price of 15€ though? 10€ perhaps. Wait for it to be on sale.			"

												Zombie shooters have become the generic genre for games that World War II was in the 90's and the millennial shift. Some titles are really good, some not so much. The Haunted is not one of the top-players, the competition of undead is far to tough for that. But it does have something the others don't have; that gritty bloody realistic ""Omph!"" factor. In this age of zombified inflation, we still kind of want to be reminded of the fact that when you kill a zombie it's supposed to sound and look bloody and it's gotta hurt, in other words: bring on the guts and glory! That's what Haunted does well; walk up to a zombie/undead/dude from another dead dimension with a shotgun or even a mace in hand and you can feel the punch! And oh yeah, don't mind the bloodspatter on your screen, it'll wipe right of. So even if the game is more repetitive that Left 4 Dead and not as story-driven as Dead Island, those kills..they kinda make it all worth it.			"

												A lot of my friends have been asking about this game so I am going to go ahead and write up my thoughts on it here~ There is no story line, it isn't super fancy like some huge name games~ Now that is out of the way-1. The physics of the rag dolls can be HILARIOUS2. It is a survival of waves game3. There are awesome explosions and lots of blood squirting action!4. You can gain the holy grail of points5. On medium with two people is a challange, on hard it is nearly impossible (super awesome!)6. There is an achivement called Falcon Punch- Who doesn't want to get Falcon Punch?7. Playing Solo can also be fun!8.  You get to easily upgrade your weapons.9. There is a gernade launcher10. The reviews this game has gotten doesn't honestly do it justice.My thoughts? I got this game maybe two days ago and have easily put close to 4 hours of playtime into it already.  It is great for a mindless action game that helps to waste time and have fun with friends. I say get it!~			"

												Aww man this game showed alot of potential but in the end it kinda fell short. The actual game play is fun but its lacking in direction if there was some kind of story mode and maybe some real movies/cutscenes it would have been much better but alas this is more of a multiplayer shoot to score kinda of game. One of the biggest flaws is the online is very consolised and dumbed down also the community seems dead which is quite a shame.			"

												This game is sooo addicting! I love the gun upgrading system, you start with a pistol, a shotgun, and an assault rifle. As you kill the monsters, you gain XP. When you have leveled up, the last creature you kill will drop a weapon upgrade box. Equip wjich gun you want to upgrade (i always pick the pistol first, but its 100% your choice) and pick the box up. Then BAM you have a better pistol, shotgun or assault rifle! (whichever you chose) I love the creature designas well, its SO refreshing to see NEW ideas, that haven't been used before. Because I have played Left 4 Dead 1 and 2, both Killing Floor games and both Dead Island games, and all of them have had a puking monster, a charging monster, or a screaming monster. This game does have a puking minster, but other than that, this game has new ideas, and it makes the game challenging and more versatile. Fun alone (but very challenging) but amazing to play with a friend. I still can't kill the final boss, but its still a blast!			"

												This game is solid.  Do not confuse this game with KILLING FLOOR or any recent titles that are alike in concept.  This game is different mechanically, structurally and is extremely challenging.   At first, it takes a bit to get used to the controls, but after a bit of practice, this game flows quite well.  It's extremely challenging, fun, fast paced and - personally speaking - have had zero bug issues at all.  I'd highly recommend getting this game.			"

												If u want a fun game to play with friends and laugh your asses off at how it is then buy this.in reality its just a average game. underdeveloped and some issues. you cant fire your gun without aiming (slows you down extremely). camera is bad and stiff, have had alot of issues with it. and there are not alot of players to play with randomly. Overall if u wanna spend some money on a fun average game then buy this.6/10. its fun to play but not memorable.			"

												Hidden Gem!Great Fun with friends, Great CO-OP.Solo can be kinda boring, similar to playing KF 2 or Left 4 Dead solo.This game can be dirt cheap during sales, Def worth price, sale or not.I had a ton of fun playing this game when it first came out with friends, the only down side to this game is that the Devs changed the way the spawns work in the game. When the game first came out there was litteraly so many spawns on the screen that it was causing PC issues for alot of players, the Devs scaled back the spawns significantly and the game was just never the same.....Overall I would still REC. trying this game out, its fast, fun, chaotic, and a blast to play with a few friends.

												Sometimes humans are even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s than demons. If you are looking for a fast paced splatter, this is probably one of the best i have seen, where art, animations, music, sound effects and character voices, are wisely combined to make one of those games that you rarely see nowadays.- Two PvP modes, and dedicated servers available.
