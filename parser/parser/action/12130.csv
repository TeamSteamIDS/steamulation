												This game works fine with windows 7. Just download a new .exe here: http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/882811/manhunt.exe and replace the one in your steam folder. Then patch it with the patch here:  http://gzwn.net/manhuntpatcher/Enjoy.A brutal cat and mouse game. Very well done. One of the best stealth games, it has a great atmosphere, it's a classic.			"

												I'll admit, it's a bit messed up that I started playing this when I was just a kid, but I'm certainly glad that I didn't miss out on it. It's one hell of a game and stuff can be as brutal as you want it to be (my favorite). Manhunt has brought me many moments of terror and countless adrenaline rushes, and it would probably still do that if I were to play it today. Despite how controversial the game is because of it's content, it's not any worse than most of the games that kids are still currently playing. Although, this remains the only game where I have snuck up on a guy and carved a hole into his stomach with a sickle, so I could watch his intestines poor onto the ground. He deserved it though.My Rating: 7.5/10			"

												Hello everyone,I just bought Manhunt 2 for my eight year old son. He said that he really wanted the game. So, I went and bought the Wii version of it for him. I gave the game to him and watched him play. I was astonished at how good the graphics were and how kid-friendly the game is. I was so proud of him when he acted out the murders of multiple people on the screen. My favorite was when he wrapped the telephone wire around one of the character's neck and choke him to death. After he was done with the game, I tried it out and loved it. The thrill of a kill is amazing. I am recommending to every parent here to buy Manhunt 2 for their children. It is fun for the whole family!--Ginathis video game should be banned because 1. violence (Even though movies are ok)2. school shooters (even though so far none have played this)3.

												This is definitely one of the best stealth games ever created. You get to basically be the slasher from horror movies.Getting this to play is a bit of an issue though. You need to replace the existing .exe file with another file that you can find in the forums (http://steamcommunity.com/app/12130/discussions/0/828939978361803059/).			"

												For real one of my favorite games of all time, this beats the GTA series in my opinion.The Manhunt series, were so brutal that Rockstar had to cancel any future projects, due to it's controversy. Which is very sad, because this is a masterpiece, so is Manhunt 2.Not for weak souls..10 out of Bloody 10!			"
