												So this what it feels like ? So this is what the wait for Half Life 3 feels like. Half Life 2 Episode Two is the sequel to Episode One and begins straight away. We find ourselves in the outskirts of City 17 as the Citadel has now opened a portal to the Combines home world and it's now up to us to find a way to the rebel base and shut down the portal once and for all.The gameplay is identical to previous titles in the Half Life 2 games.  Overall there's not much to say here as it's basically DLC to Half Life 2. Graphics wise this game looks a tad bit better than Half Life 2 due to the range rendering, which I thought was under used in Half Life 2 Episode One. The portal coming from the citadel can be seen throughout the entire game which looks outstanding.There is a reason this is my favorite Half Life title and that's the action sequences. This game is like a great action movie. Action scenes after action scenes after action scenes and it all ends up to one of the biggest cliffhanger endings in history of gaming. I'm not joking it actually pains me not knowing what happens next.I also love the incredible soundtrack. It's beyond kick ♥♥♥ and is one of my favorite game soundtracks of all time.In the end Half Life 2 Episode Two is a thrilling ride and it should be played by everyone. I'm glad I finally joined the bandwagon. Now I can join the Half Life 3 waiting community. Final Rating:10/10 - A must own and a must playIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												Nice told with AlyxHALF-LIFE 2 EPISODE 2 starts immediately where Half-Life 2 Episode 1 ended. Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance must continue their fight, alongside the resistance, against the evil Combine. After the ever so slightly below par Episode 1, Episode 2 is a real return to form. Everything that was so good about HL2 is developed here and made even better. The narrative arc is strong, the dialogue well-written and witty, the voice acting accomplished and convincing, the environments spectacular and varied, and the mix between puzzle solving and combat just right. We meet several new enemies and some of the combat is pretty challenging, especially the final battle which is big on scale and mayhem and requires real strategy to complete. It’s a tough finale but well worth the effort. There’s so much to enjoy in the whole Half-Life series I can’t recommend these games enough.5/5			"

												As with Episode One, there's little to be said besides what I've said about Half-Life 2. Episode Two can be challenging at times, for example fighting the newly introduced Hunters with their sophisticated AI or during the tense finale. Story-wise Episode Two expands the plot beyond City 17 however by the end you'll be left with a 9-year-old and counting cliff-hanger. Regardless, Episode Two is arguably the best expandalone in the entire series; it's definitely worth picking up.			"

												A more decent follow-up to Half Life 2 than what Episode 1 was. I missed new enemies and new environments there but this episode delivered all of them. The story is interesting and it is a shame no conclusion is reached once you complete the second (and probably last) expansion to Half Life. The Source engine now runs an enhanced version and you can immediately see the better effects and more beautiful surroundings early on in the game.This is a very decent expansion pack; I only wish there was a third and final episode that would conclude the story or perhaps leave more room for Half Life 3.

It is a sequel to the previous game, Half-Life 2: Episode One.Half-Life 2: Episode Two follows up Gordon Freeman story from Half-Life 2: Episode One after the destruction of City 17. This time you're not going to play in City 17 anymore, the city is gone, and you're going to see more places in Half-Life universe and also, meet some new and more dangerous enemies.Half-Life 2: Episode Two is another good sequel to the Half-Life series.

More importantly  the story was just  BADASS , there were so many amazing turn of events and the way they introduced new enemies, new wepons and stuff and funny aspects, the least i can say is i loved itBut i still have lots of questions in my mind.. like what happens after Alyx's father was murdered? What legendary borelli were they talking about? What ship Alyx's father asked us to destroy? To answer all these question they need to make Half-Life 3 but  according to   Gaben's  math teacher... gaben used to get sick by hearing the number 3.. so i guess Half-Life 3 is not possible but i see slight chances of Half-Life 3 in PS4's generation becuz:ps4+ps3+ps2+ps1add the numbers4+3+2+1=10Divide it by the number of consoles10/4= 2.5 round it off = 3 HALF-LIFE 3 CONFIRMED!!!!

												Half Life 2 is a first person shooter game released in 2004. It was awarded as the Game of the Decade in the VGA Awards. The award was received by Gabe Newell, Valve founder.The game takes place 20 years after the Black Mesa incident of Half Life ( The game that chaged it all ) . Gordon Freeman awakes from hibernation in City 17 and become part of the resistance to face the Combine Empire and attempt to defeat it. In the game Gordon meets Alyx Vance,  who is part of the resistance. The game is one of the pioneers in introducing a playmate .Half Life 2 presents different enemies . The Headcrabs still produce that feeling of rejection when they attack. The action is breathtaking but it breaks , not like Call of Duty games where you shoot without breathing.The narrative is implemented throughout the game, not with recording or notes , it is not necessary. The experience is brilliant. The Source engine allows good management of physics and the introduction of a new weapon. The gravity gun . The technology also allows open spaces in addition to traditional outdoor passageways and internal spaces .The handling of the narrative and physics puzzles changed the way the FPS games developed from there into the future . It was a turning point in games history the same way it was the first Half Life .The game was released for PC under Windows , required a 2 Ghz processor . 512 MB ​​of RAM , and a graphics card compatible with Direct X 8.1 . For the few resources sought at that time the graphical quality of the game was very good and ran very smoothly .This is one of the ""must play"" games if one is serious about being a Gamer ,not only for its quality but also for being part of the history of video games.

But Towards the end, I was not disappointed.

												Episode Two... IMO the most challenging episode so far (especially on hard mode). New areas, new enemies, and a whole lot of fun! If you really push it, you can get 20 or more hours out of it. Episode Two is definitely worth your time and money!And yes, it's true... it has a great cliffhanger :>			"

												Episode Two is even more amazing.  What is disappointing is why Episode Three has never been released.  Valve, we are your gamers.  We are fans of the series.  We were so hyped after we played this years back, and over time, that hype has slowly faded and much confusion replaced it.  I mean, what exactly happened?  Did developers leave the project?  Voice actors go on strike?  Did a very important voice actor pass away or go missing?I don't get why no clear answers are given.  We would understand if something went wrong that would cause major delays or a halt on the project.  We just want answers.  It's been 8 years.  Don't we gamers deserve a response?In any case, Half-Life, Half-Life 2, and all the episodes are fantastic.			"

												I was concerned about the lack of content from Valve so I beagn an inquiry into it. After finding nothing and getting ""I don't want to comment on this yet"" from thier CEO Gabe Newell, I decided to give up. I noticed gaben with a large grin on his face as i walked away from Valve HQ it saddens me more. Then I look up as a woman asks me ""Are you that guy investigating valve?"". ""Yes I am"". She then said ""I'm Gaben's old maths teacher and when looking through his old maths tests I found one question he got wrong!"". ""What was it?"" I asked. ""2+1""she said. A true look of surprise crossed my face. I looked back to where Gaben had been. He looked concerned and frightened. I began running as fast as I could back to Valve HQ. But Gaben was faster he used his long fall boots to jump straight down the stair well. He then boarded the front exits with filling cabnets using his gravity gun. I shouted at gaben to let me in but his only reply was ""THESE THINGS THEY TAKE TIME!"". I was to angry to give up now. I sparta kicked the door and filling cabnets down. Gaben ran for the stairs throwing a barrage of crowbars at me. I refused to stop. Chasing him up the stairs I found him in his office. In one hand he helled one of his many swords and in the other a copy of the illusive Half Life 3. ""If you come a step closer I swear to god i'll destroy this and bury it where no one will find it, in a mexican land fill!"". ""NOOOOOOOOOOOO!"" I screamed. I jumped at gabe and grabbed half life 3. However Gaben managed to stab me in the proccess. Gaben tried to grab half life 3 but I wouldnt let him. I dived out the way as Gabe charged at me. He missed and hit a wall and was knocked out. I ran as far as i could from Valve HQ as I could which was about a metre. I fell to the ground in an alley way just to the side of Valve HQ. I layed up against the wall slowly bleeding to death. ""We made it Gordon"" I said. but we hadn't, just then Gaben came round the corner. He kneeled down in front of me. He stroked his finger down my face ""shhhhh"" he exclaimed and threw an egg at me. ""It will never be oger"" he wispered gently to me. I began to fall unconcious as he walked away. I felt myself slipping but as I died I let out a tremendous ""33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333!"". HALF LIFE 3 COMFIRMED.			"

												It's almost poetic, really. Half-Life 2: Episode 2 details the struggle of Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance as they struggle through hardships on their way to White Forest. The game, after a few surprises here and there, ends on a high note - the Combine have, for now, been defeated. Everyone is celebrating, but also awaiting anxiously for what comes next.But there is hope.Then, as the game ends, that hope has been shattered, sucked dry in a few, agonizing moments. With Eli gone, the Resistance has lost some of its will to fight. Even though the Combine have been crippled, they do not die, and the Resistance must struggle yet more against the shadow of their malefactors.Time will tell whether or not they succeeded. Perhaps the Resistance, after waiting for over a decade, will finally get their wish - to be free, at last. They can finally rest a little bit easier at night, knowing that they now have what they wanted.Until such a day, however, this is the end of the line. This is the final stop until they finish building that railroad ahead.In the meantime... This is where I get off.			"

												Half Life 2 Ep. 2 came out in 2007, a year after Ep. 1. Just like Ep. 1 it's quite short, this time ~5 hrs. But compared to Ep. 1 it actually has some new content to deliver other than the story.New enemy types were added. The Hunters for the Combine and the poisonous arachnids.The game also has awesome levels. The arachnid lair for example. At one point of the game, you will also get a car - much better than HL2's. Finally, there is epic battle in the last chapter. Personally this is my favorite.Come on Valve. It's time to raise the bar for the 3rd time. We have waited long enough for a sequel.			"

												Episode Two starts off with City 17 blowing up and a spectacular bridge crashing behind you.  From then on it's a fight to get to safety and find Alyx's father.  With a lot of exterior battles and action, this game in the series feels very large while still maintaining the short packed with action game that an episode should be.  However, you should know that the game ends with a huge cliffhanger and that there is no sight of Half Life Episode 3 or Half Life 3 coming out in the near future.  This is rather disappointing, but at the same time has kept many a fans chomping at the bit for a new release in the series.			"

												It has been officialy 10 years since Half-life last showed life. Back then, it literally shocked and blew the gaming industry away and I'm gonna tell you right now that Half-Life is THE reason why gaming is so big as of the present day. And I'm pretty sure that Valve would never keep a successful franchise away, that amazing and fun gameplay, including a great story, emotional characters that you are always attached to and a great variety of weapons. The graphics still look amazing as of today. Valve just nailed it back then with the Source engine! And with all these years that have passed and no sign of Half-Life 3 on an Episode 3, gamers are getting more and more concerned throughout the years. Let's cross our fingers and pray to Lord Gaben, he might do something, but I think it's gonna release in 2018 or 2019. Let's have our hopes up!			"

You will be angry. Because atmosphere in this game amazing and non stop action taking you. After a couple of hours you  are starting to think you are Gordon Freeman and when the game finish you can not save yourself from ambient. Suddenly it finishes and your all enjoyable times finish. If you interest with this game, you must play Half Life 2 and Half Life 2 Episode One definitely. There is not too much thing to say for this amazing episode of the main game.

I regret not playing it sooner, and I cry for those who have waited years longer than myself, along with those who have passed on waiting for the sequel that will never come.			"

*SPOILERS* I was never really hyped for Half-Life 3 to come, but that ending man. That ending really made want to see how the story unfolds even more. Episode Two is better than Episode One of course, but the ending just leaves me hanging by so much that I just keep on asking myself so many different questions like what happens next. But this is a game I would play again and again. The nice flowing story, the fantastic level design, puzzles, and voice acting just makes this feel all the more worth your time. I would totally recommend this game regardless of the ending valve gave us.			"

												A good piece of Half-Life content but not the ending the series deserves. The community will never get the final conclusion to Half-Life for reasons unknown. If you're not a fan of getting involved in a story with no end, then pass on this one. The base game Half-Life 2 had some semblance of an ending that could stand on its own feet, Not this one. Major cliffhanger with no resolution. Ever. It's a bummer what has become of Valve. I guess making games is too expensive now, ironic considering the company is the most profitable it's ever been.

												Don't get me wrong, Half Life 2 and both of its episodes are great. They're amazing games, and I hadn't played a singleplayer game like this in a while. The reason that I don't recommend any of Half Life 2 is because of where it leaves off. Episode 2 ends on a huge, depressing cliffhanger. Mind you, this game came out 9 years ago. 9 years. And only now Valve says they ""might"" start working on a sequel that would be done in 2018. I mean, if you don't get sucked into games that easily, if you don't care about the characters, if you can't connect with anything this game has to offer, then go for it. Otherwise, you'll just end this with everything feeling incomplete.I don't know, maybe I'm being too harsh. I just hate getting so immersed into a game and then having it end all of the sudden. It would be like watching a movie, and then having the film catch on fire halfway through, and then having it burn down the whole theater with all of your hopes and dreams inside.			"

												Episode Two is, while not as ambitious, mysterious, varied and exciting as HL2, a much better paced and focused game, which features the best gameplay HL2 and the Episodes have offered, together with a solid, mature narrative and art direction. As always, graphics, technology, voice acting and visual direction are pretty much at the highest standards here. You'll traverse massive, intricate cave systems, navigate the vast Outland both on foot and via vehicle, all the while encountering unique situations that advance HL2's mechanics in interesting ways. And the final battle is definitely something to be hold, and a remarkable first for the Half-Life series.It's a shame, then, that this is where the story has ended, thus far. Valve have no excuse not to continue it; but then again, you don't have any excuse not to play it, finish it, and understand just what people have been waiting for for almost 10 years.			"

Finally the Bull Squid from HL1 is back in a much better design a.k.a. Acid Antlion. It is diverse, got lots of challenges and is by all means the toughest amongst the HL franchise; especially at the end. All what the first Episode lacked, they made up for and I am not only talking about the length. Truly worth of the series and a must buy for any HL enthusiast.			"

+ This is essentially the second stand-alone expansion to Half-Life 2 that starts off at the same moment that Half-Life 2 Episode 1 ended. This is great for those who have already finished Half-Life 2 and Episode 1,  and want more content.+ Same great gameplay as Half-Life 2, same weapons, nothing dramatically new + Expands on the story, answers some questions, while leaving you still wanting more by the end. This game also makes a connection to the Portal series.+ New enemies, Hunters, Antlion Workers, Antlion Guardian, and Combine Advisors.+ New vehicle, a Muscle Car which is just as fun to drive as the Scout Car. + One of the most thrilling final battles throughout the entirety of Half Life 2 which consists of defending a base against an onslaught of Striders and Hunters.+ Visually the game looks even better than the two previous games with some great looking environments.+ Episode 2 has a bit more content than Episode 1, being around 3.5-4hours in length, and is overall a better experience.- Very sudden abrupt ending....- The first half of the game is mostly spent underground in mines, and Antlion caves. I started to feel a bit costraphobic, and just feel like this section went on for too long.~ If you have NOT played Half-Life 2 or Episode 1, do NOT play this game first. I'm not really sure why this is a stand-alone game			"

												Great game, played through it when it came out, as I did with the other Half-life games. However, after waiting nearly 10 years for the promised ""Half-life 2: Episode Three"", my patience has worn thin, especially with the direction Valve is heading these days. I don't recommend getting this game anymore, as sad as that is. The story is not finished, many elements in the story are left unexplained. Why buy a book that is half written, with no ending?Edit: I do recommend the game.			"

												The Half-Life Series has left a legacy for a reason. Enough said. If you're planning on buying the games individually, dont. Search the ""Orange Box"" on steam and buy it instead. You get the entire series plus Portal, and it comes out cheaper. The Orange Box was on sale yesterday for $5 on greenmangaming. Its normally 20 dollars however, which is still a pretty good deal. I think i bought it for $10. so yeah, the box can save you some money if you place it on your wishlist and buy it on sale.			"

												It's 2015 - almost 20 years since first person shooters changed for good after HL 1. If you still haven't played half-life, you probably don't know the definition of FPS at all.Support single / co-op campaign games by buying them. They are really hard to make, and they aren't as profitable as crappy Pay-to-Win / Purchase-Coins-to-Play-on-Facebook games, and they take a really long time and a really big financial risk. Don't use illegal copies, just buy the games if you like them. The gaming world needs more good games like this one, and gaming companies need your money to make more of those games. I promess you, every single Half-Life is worth it.			"

These games do not disappoint. They're absolutely amazing, they're so damn amazing that you'll want to play through these games multiple times.Y'know I bought these games in 2011 and I only played through them for a little bit then my dumbass 13-14 year old self got bored. Which explains the funky amount of hours, but I finally beat them all. It wasn't easy, it was at times rage-inducing, but it was my own stupidity that made it rage-inducing. I love these games a lot, and you bet your sweet ♥♥♥ I will be playing through them again. Although if you don't own ANY  of the 3 games.. Episode 2 ends on a really big cliffhanger which pisses me off. Come on VALVe, don't do this to us.. Give us HL3. I want to know what happens next. We all want to know what happens next. We want more, and it's been far too long (episode 2  came out 8 years ago).			"

												A worthy successor of the Half-Life franchise, adding new content in and making a great connection to Episode 1 and the original Half-Life 2, plus a callback to Half-Life.Pros:+New enemies+New vehicles+New visuals+Great storyline+Fun moments+Still does not take you out of the game. Want to ♥♥♥♥ around while some people are talking? Go ahead!+No timers, feel free to explore+No DLC+New weapons (in some sense)+Great music+Finally, flashlight doesn't take away from your auxiliary power.Cons:-Short-Level design is quite questionable-Price is also questionable, although you do get many more things with it, such as new stuff to spawn in G-Mod and other things.Should you get it? Yes.			"

												The last in the epic series so far, this is a must play for all fps and half lovers alike. The story takes an important turn in this installment and the game ends in a cliffhanger.Many loyal fans all over the world including me are still eagerly waiting for the next installment in the series from valve. And there have been no scarcity of half life marathons in an attempt to reignite this series.There have been rumours that the next (hl3?) is in the works but I just hope that it comes out before 2020 (thats when half life 2 takes place btw) :DBack to episode 2, just get it!10/10			"

												The second installment of the episodic series of Half Life 2 is an all around improvement to the series as a whole. The improved graphics, the engrossing story, and immersive game play all had me coming back for much more even after completing it. The level design is beyond brilliant and everything from the ant-lion caves to traveling to White Forest felt unique and very much detail oriented. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that has played any Half Life game in the past, though you will definitely want to play through EP 1 and HL2 first.			"

												Half-Life 2: Episode Two is an amazing addition to the Half-Life series. Episode Two is twice as long as Episode One and is filled with non-stop action in the scenic forest mountains. Episode Two improves upon everything from the first Episode making it the superior Episode of the two and is real treat to play making every moment enjoyable. The story and environments all tie in very well and unfold nicely as the game progresses which you just want to continue going to see what is next. Now we just have to wait for Episode 3 or Half-Life 3... will either ever come out or is this the end of the road of a fantastic series?			"

												The continuation of Half-Life 2: Episode One, which is a continuation of Half-Life 2. This game takes a different and  longer path than Episode One, but stunning and gripping nonetheless while following Gordon's adventures. Continuing straight off of Episode One, the game takes you through a tour of the more nature and abandonment parts of the Half-Life 2 universe. The graphics are enchanced greatly, and include some features and characters as well as some new enemies as well. This game sadly leads off a huge cliff hanger, which leads to the development of the very late Half-Life 2: Episode Three, which will come some time in the future. Other than that, the game is absolutely great, and we will all hope the Episode Three will come as soon as possible, but in the meanwhile, we will look forward this great masterpiece of a series that came to Steam. Thank you, Valve.			"

												After finishing a massive marathon of the half-life series from half-life 1 to this, I have to say, all HL3 jokes aside, that Episode Three NEEDS to be made. Period. For a game made in 2007, this game surpasses most games made nowadays with its simply exeptional blend of gameplay and story. Can you imagine the possibilities with, say, the engine they're using on Black Mesa? To be honest, I don't think anyone (with the exception of REALLY picky people) would care if the graphics weren't updated if this level of gameplay and story quality continues. An outstanding piece, which I would happily pay 100 dollars to have the sequel of. Please valve. PLEASE.			"

												I have recently played through all the Half-Life 2 games and I believe this one is the best. Let me explain. I am a total sucker for great endings (which is the main reason Portal 2 is my favorite game ever) and this one REALLY delivered. I mean, even for a series that ALWAYS ends on a cliffhanger, this is one damn big cliffhanger. The gameplay is solid, but it's a half-life game so thats a given. The new enemies were a lot of fun to fight. You will die a lot, especially on the final fight, which is a blast. But yeah, go buy it if you haven't yet.*SPOILER ALERT*The reason the ending got to me is that it's something that wouldn't fly in a modern game. It's not even done in a cutscene. The fact that they decided to kill Eli, a character who's been with us since the very beginning, shows Valve's got guts. And I respect them for that.9.5/10			"

												Here's the moment that it all comes to life: you finally get to play along a vortigaunt that blasts enemies away like in the original Half-life and it all leads to an epic fight that combines driving and shooting perfectly, à la GTA or probably even better, and it all leads up too, hmm, nothingness. Like with SIN: EPISODES, the final chapter was never released. I guess we have to settle for that, at least we got some decent fights with some new enemies (the hunters and acid antlings), but I do wonder why the episodic games using the Source engine never got finished...

												Arguably the best installment in the Half-Life 2 games, Episode 2 is another brilliant additional to the already amazing Half-Life story and is also the reason behind Half-Life 3's world-wide anticipation. Again. Half-Life 2 and it's additional episodes need no introduction or explanation,  but those of you that have not followed this story or played any of the games in the series, you are truly missing out. There is a reason why these games are globaly acclaimed and admired, so for all kinds of gamers, this is something you simply have to experience at some point in your life.The only benefit of not playing Half-Life 2 is that you wouldn't be a part of the enormous amount of people suffering the extremely long wait for Half-Life 3.

												My favorite game in HL2, this game explored the rural side of the HL2 universe, unlike the dystopian settings of the previous game. I found the part with the car in the jungle extremely good, and the antlion's nest is quite amusing as well. The final battle with the Striders is thrilling.

												Now I know why everyone has been screaming for episode three!Like the rest of Half-Life 2, it holds up extremely well.  The fight in the antlion caves is claustrophobic.  The later set-piece defensive battle is just the right amount of frantic.  The physics puzzles are interesting and well integrated into the environment and provide a nice break from shooting things.  There is a fantastic ""we're screwed"" battle that I won't give away.  The final fight is unique, wide-spread and tense.  The ending I did not see coming, Chekhov would be proud.The game engine, graphics and physics hold up very well.  The plot, characters and voices remain excellent.  While you're clearly on a rail, everything you do makes sense to progress the plot.  The game features several very distinct areas and types of gameplay, each feel unique, enjoyable and don't last too long.If you still haven't finished all of Half Life 2, go do it now.NOW!			"

												Much better than Episode One! In terms of length, content, and also provides new scenery for the player. Since Episode 2 takes places in the forest outside City 17 there will be new enemes to take on besides the combine. Such as the wildlife. Alex still tags along with you and still provides much appreciated help and support. You get to use the buggy again too! All the same guns are in this game that were in the previous two games of the series. Your main objective in Episode 2 to get to the White Forest where where Dr. Kleiner and Eli Vance, and a new character the very much assured of himself and thinks nothing he does is wrong Dr. Magnuson are at a missle base. They need the data packet that Alyx downloaded at the citadel before they can launch a satelite into space to close the portal that opened when the Citadel came apart at the end of Episode 1.			"

												What about this expansion, for me it was even better than the base game, a mind-blowing experience that justifies the clamor for a third title for the series. The gameplay in this is even more dynamic than in the base game and the first expansion, there are many action sequences and breathtaking events, new enemies, new locations and the engine is further enhanced in all aspects. In this episode there are many more situations relevant to the overall plot, you stay with Alyx most of the time and there are events that deepen even more the relation of you two and the end can raise any expectation for a third title to another level, just epic. I highly recommend it, as I said, to me this expansion was the best title of the series ever released. 9/10			"

												'member Gordon Freeman? Oh I 'member.HL2 Ep2 is still a fantastic shooter that ends in a huge cliffhanger and more than 9 years later we still don't have a sequel.It's obviously hard to produce something that can top Ep2 (or Portal 2) but leaving players with a big cliffhanger for such a long time ain't nice either. Maybe Valve should let some other company do a sequel if they aren't able or willing to do it themselves. After all this time I don't even want something groundbreaking anymore. Just some decent shootbang in the HL Universe that gives players at least something like an ending to the HL Story. [G-Man died on his way back to his home planet]That's why I nominated HL2 EP Two for The “Game That Needs A Sequel ASAP” Award			"

												Half-Life 2 Episode Two follows much in the footsteps of Episode One as a generally underwhelming experience. It does distinguish itself on a number of points though.Episode Two picks up where Episode One left off and once again tells you to save the world. Like Episode One there is very little new in this, most of the areas and encounters feel like repeats and you'll quickly become boring with the monotone gameplay.Episode Two does jump a bar above Episode One by giving you quite a bit more story as you travel through the game and that does help keep you playing for a little while longer.In the end however it feels too much like what has been done before and the verdict is much the same as Episode One. Get it if you want a few more hours of Half-Life 2 single-player but don't expect any more than that. It's an entirely forgettable expansion.			"

												Episode Two is an absolute must-purchase for any FPS fan. It’s an amazing experience from beginning to end. I truly cannot think of a way to improve this game.Any way you look at it, Episode Two stands out, even among the Half-Life series, as something special. It may be shorter than the original, but it's a burly experience packed into roughly six hours or so that offers up all the diversity, level design, and thoughtful gameplay we've known while making sure to propel the story forward and leave us wanting more.Episode 2 is an awesome example of packing various kinds of gameplay into a compressed time span without the whole thing descending into a discombobulated mess.

												Half life 2 episode 2 is an excellent game. This game introduce lots of thing such as new enemy, new kind of gameplay, new world to explore and a great story.Half life 2 episode 2 opens immediately after the first episode ended. This episode is better than the first episode mainly because it's a lot longer, new enemy and more.I like the new enemy "" Hunter "" and the new antlion worker. These new enemies are challenging and i love it.The level design is also very interesting just like the part when you're objective is to defend the vortigaunt while healing Alyx from hordes of antlion in the cave and the part when you have to kill lots of strider in white forest base.this game also makes me emotionally invested by the end of it. Half life 2 episode 2 is one of the best game i play in recent years.This game alson have one of the best cliffhanger and makes me want to play episode 3.I hope Gabe Newell do make Half life 2 episode 3 or half life 3 because Gordon's adventure can't end like that. we still have to save Dr. Judith Mossman so.... Gordon's adventure still continue.For that i highly recommend this game to everybody who likes video game obviously.10/10 for me for sure			"

Because of Valve's unwillingness to conclude Half-Life these questions will forever be unanswered leaving us Half-Life fans in eternal pain and torment. Some other sad stuff happened too like how Eli died and stuff. "

												I replayed the whole HL2 series recently, and Episode Two really is the standout of the entire thing. The open air, the Hunters, the ominous march of the Combine towards White Forest. All the Half-Life games are made up of distinct and memorable sections, but Episode Two is the only one where each bit is a joy to play through every time. Even the antlion tunnels – I love the steep shadows, squelchy grubs, and the violent fizz of the acid blobs the workers spit at you. “We must have misunderestimated them!”			"

												WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT ENDING???Episode 2 continues on where Episode 1 left off. Gordon and Alyx have already escaped from City 17 and have to get to White Forest - a resistance base. Throughout their journey they are constantly chased by the Combine.While in Episode 1 the setting was mostly urban, in Episode 2 you traverse through the countryside and the area around it. When you have progressed enough through the game you will find an old muscle car that you will use to get to White Forest, func_vehicle returns in Episode 2, not seen in Episode 1. Not that much puzzles are tied to the passage of the car being blocked, though they still are present.New enemies added include the notorious Hunters. They usually travel in packs and are tough opponents. Alyx is the first to have an experince with a Hunter and it seems that they are too strong, but they can be defeated relatively easy, depending on what you shoot them with. You will also face a lot of striders and obtain a new device used to destroy them - a Magnusson Device.Episode 2 is made with the same engine as HL2 and Episode 1 so the graphics are the same.In the end, if you have played the other games, but not this one, then you should buy it.

												Loved this. At first I was excited because the game was in the open woods, a place half life hasn't explored much, but then the game alludes to more mining levels, a place I've already been in HalfLife 2, so I lost my excitement.... then I got to the mines.Boy, this game had me jumping left and right, in the game and irl. Huge beasts chasing you, terrifying zombies crawling behind you, giant monsters trying to wreck yo stuff up.The stroy as well was very, as per usual, amazing. Though it really leaves a lot of answers totally unanswered.Well worth the playthough, better than episode 1 also imho.			"

												And again, not much to say. Episode Two continues where Episode One left off, and is so far the last game in the Half-Life series. Once again you have Alyx as a partner, though you'll spend a part of the game by yourself because of story reasons. There's also a lot more driving around this time. It's about as long as Episode One so if you liked Half-Life 2 and Episode One, you'll probably like this. Though be warned, once you finish this game, you WILL be frustrated with the fact that Valve still hasn't come out with Episode Three or Half-Life 3 yet.			"

												Oh weeell. I didn't thought Half Life2 could be even better...it's like you are in cinema on a great movie, and when it ends, you realize it was only a movie before the main program. Episode 2 has perfect level design (which was amazing in Half Life series all the time, but this time it's extraordinary), story is as amazing and breathtaking as before and the upgraded visuals pour new blood into Source's veins. And your flashlight has finally separated battery.			"

												Because the soundtrack is the best of the Half-Life universe and because you want to see the gnome in the rocket. Alyx's ♥♥♥ is also counting if you're a certain friend of mine.The game is starting after the crash of your train and the destruction of City 17. You're alone with Alyx in a forest and after finding an abandoned outpost, you're attacked by an enemy you've never seen before. Alyx is badly wounded and her life is at stake, only Vortigaunts can save her. And from there, you're going to a journey in a mine. And reaching the White Forest base will take time too.This episode was released in the Orange Box, that is including Half-Life 2, Episode 1, Portal and Team Fortress 2. It was the first Half-Life on PC to have achievements, because of the release on X-box.While the game is short, the episode is still intense as you're meeting more Antlions (and new types too), you have to defend the outpost from them in an intense battle, a new car makes its appearance, a new combine type is also making its debut, spicing up the game but also, you're finally face to face to a real Combine. And that's scary because you can't do anything about it. The White Forest ambush is also a good moment but the most difficult passage is White Forest defense against Striders. If they reach the base, it's game over. But with the Magnusson devices, you can quickly kill them. If you manage to make them stick, that's it.However, while this passage is really hard for the achievement with no building destroyed, the most annoying quest (for achievement, you're not forced to do it) is to bring the gnome to the rocket. And the gnome in your car?  Well, it's falling off every 5 seconds. So, in other words, you're going forward, stop the car, get the gnome back, restart the engine, advance, stop the car, etc... And another one that can rival that is to kill every Antlion larva in the mine (333 to crush) and some of them are well hidden.With the cliffhanger, you'll understand why it's since 8 years that we're waiting for the Episode 3. Or Half-Life 3.			"

												I am just going to say this right now. I really loved this game. This is going to be a long review as well. Just sayin'.Now, I do have reasons to say so. I personally disliked Half-Life 2, and Half-Life 2 Episode 1. Still buy them, because to get the full experience of Episode 2 you need to know not only the story, but how much the game improved.Now, the entire Half-Life 1 (classic?) series was great, while sometimes buggy. What can I say? Golden Source is golden. The gameplay was smooth, the weapons were nice and powerfull-ish, and you played as a variety of characters.(STILL BUY THIS GAME! SKIP IF YOU DON'T LIKE CRITICISM) Here is where Half-Lfe 2 comes in. Gordon Freeman in a City 17 train, waiting with the rest of the ctizens. Commence with an overly long section without even a crowbar, picking up and throwing spare junk. A little while after, you spend way too long speeding around in an airboat. Then the Gravity Gun, to pick up and throw even more spare junk, but at high speeds. A dunebuggy with suspension level ten thousand, not to mention two types of portable infinite ammo. Last but not least, the 1500 Megawatt Black Mesa Heavy Duty Super-Colliding Super Gravity Gun. One last way to run around with over 9000 HEV and the one weapon to rule them all. The NPCs in the game? ""Oh, Gordon Freeman. We worship you, even though you basically caused this whole mess and only saved yourself."" Barney Calhoun, the dropout hero of Blue Shift? ""Headhumper. Headhumper. Hey, I finally took one down!""All of these were fun, but too drawn-out. No offense to Valve, but the majority of gamers can learn how to use a gimmick in much less time than otherwise thought. Overall, Half-Life 2 had long expanses of nothing, but in reality some of the best  gameplay experiences I've ever had.(SERIOUSLY, STILL BUY THIS GAME! YOU, THE READER, HAVE THE POWER TO SKIP AT ANY TIME!) Half-Lide 2 Episode 1. Where do I begin? Morg- Gordon Freeman wakes up, and for some reason goes right back into the Citadel. Here he aquires the Conveniently Temporary Over-Powered Blue Zero-Point Energy Manipulator. I didn't think highly of this game from up front, remembering the whimper in which Half-Life 2 ended. From here on,  The gameplay is mostly indoors with airducts, similar to Half-Life 1. But, the story was meh. To add, Alyx's AI walked right up to every enemy, and died too often. The fights were really intense, though. All being said, the game kind of ended after about three hours and one strider.Overall verdict: intense, even difficult action, but compressed into too little time, squeezing out story.vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvHalf-Life 2 Episode 2. This game is EXCELLENT. If I can say this to the entirety of Steam after knocking the rest of Half-Life 2, I must mean something. Gordon now wakes up inside of the train that crashed. As the train slowly topples over, the obstacle course that you need to climb down changes. I also happen to love changing terrain, so good first impression. Now I begin to notice things. The flashlight that wore out in about ten seconds in the other games was replaced with one much more similar to Half-Life 1. Also on an individual battery, allowing you to dash for more than a few seconds. I gaze deeply into my teammate's eyes, she awkwardly turns away to avoid eye contact. Very human of her. The car is come-and-go. You can struggle through most areas either with or without the car. It lasted just as long as it was needed. and no longer. As for action, there was never a point without it. All was unique, as well. Half-Life 2 got stale, while Episode 1 was overwhelming. Episode 2 managed to get just the right mix of the two, combining into THE perfect balance. Rochelle- I mean, Alyx's AI was realistic, even to the level of the player. Then there's the Gnome. My good friend the Garden Gnome. As a display of how much Valve in the greatest compaby on this side of the universe, you get an achievement for carrying this guy through almost the whole game. While a pain as some points, I kind of grew to like the guy. The ALyx Vance mauled by a Hunter? ""Don't look, Gnome. Shield thou purest of eyes."" It's a showcase of how great the gameplay is. You literally could have taken ANY item throughout the entire game. Now, back on topic. The Characters were recovered to what they should have been. Barney as a security guard. Refugees as refugees. The vortigaunts actually using their green electricity bolts. The characters were essential to the rich storyline. The storyline alone could have made a movie, as it was what made me start rooting for Half-Life 3. Basically, every problem that I have found in any other Half-Life game was remedied in this one fantastic sequel.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Seriously, just buy the game.Now.Sell your house if you really have to.

												Well. This game. Best game ever made? Probably not, but up there. My personal favourite game of all time? Definitely.This game. This game has the most action and intiguing story crammed into 6 hours I've ever seen. Only really 4 hours shorter than Half Life 2, this game actually has a longer campaign than games such as Battlefield 3. It has a new enemy introduced to the game, (The Hunter) which is probably my favourite enemy in the series. The part where you must get the extract from the Gaurdian larvae is axtremely nerve racking and heart pounding. Going through that tight tunnel with that huge thing was one of the most amazing parts of the game. The silo defense is absolutely BRUTAL, but fun as heck and great for running over hunters. There is also the ending... well, I'd rather not spoil it. It's terrible yet amazing, and makes you really want Half Life 3 to come out. PLEASE SEE: DO NOT play this game until you have played ALL of the previous games in the series.			"

												5.4 hours playtime is reflective of the fact that Steam started tracking that stat after this game was released, not at time of release.As I'm sure most folks know, this game needs a sequel, or at least a finale.  Some semblance of care from the developers for the audience who has shown this series love for so long.  For the uninitiated, this is what you're getting into:HL2:EP2 was (and arguably still is) one of the most immersive FPS campaigns ever released.  Excellent voice acting, excellent world design, gameplay mechanics and plot.  However, if closure is something you desire, steer clear.  In the ~10 years since release of this game (which I purchased in The Orange Box upon its release), Valve has gone from 'we're doing episodic releases!' to 'we're making hats and selling games!'.  Speculation regarding an ending release has gone from hopeful to dismissive.  As of now, the fate of this world is left uncertain and unlikely ever to be revealed.  Unless Valve was shooting for an extremely subtle metaphor for the real world, then this is a cliffhanger whose principals will be forever dangling.10/10 For everything but the end.			"

												I am just going to say this right now. I really loved this game. This is going to be a long review as well. Just sayin'.Now, I do have reasons to say so. I personally disliked Half-Life 2, and Half-Life 2 Episode 1. Still buy them, because to get the full experience of Episode 2 you need to know not only the story, but how much the game improved.Now, the entire Half-Life 1 (classic?) series was great, while sometimes buggy. What can I say? Golden Source is golden. The gameplay was smooth, the weapons were nice and powerfull-ish, and you played as a variety of characters.(STILL BUY THIS GAME! SKIP IF YOU DON'T LIKE CRITICISM) Here is where Half-Lfe 2 comes in. Gordon Freeman in a City 17 train, waiting with the rest of the ctizens. Commence with an overly long section without even a crowbar, picking up and throwing spare junk. A little while after, you spend way too long speeding around in an airboat. Then the Gravity Gun, to pick up and throw even more spare junk, but at high speeds. A dunebuggy with suspension level ten thousand, not to mention two types of portable infinite ammo. Last but not least, the 1500 Megawatt Black Mesa Heavy Duty Super-Colliding Super Gravity Gun. One last way to run around with over 9000 HEV and the one weapon to rule them all. The NPCs in the game? ""Oh, Gordon Freeman. We worship you, even though you basically caused this whole mess and only saved yourself."" Barney Calhoun, the dropout hero of Blue Shift? ""Headhumper. Headhumper. Hey, I finally took one down!""All of these were fun, but too drawn-out. No offense to Valve, but the majority of gamers can learn how to use a gimmick in much less time than otherwise thought. Overall, Half-Life 2 had long expanses of nothing, but in reality some of the best  gameplay experiences I've ever had.(SERIOUSLY, STILL BUY THIS GAME! YOU, THE READER, HAVE THE POWER TO SKIP AT ANY TIME!) Half-Lide 2 Episode 1. Where do I begin? Morg- Gordon Freeman wakes up, and for some reason goes right back into the Citadel. Here he aquires the Conveniently Temporary Over-Powered Blue Zero-Point Energy Manipulator. I didn't think highly of this game from up front, remembering the whimper in which Half-Life 2 ended. From here on,  The gameplay is mostly indoors with airducts, similar to Half-Life 1. But, the story was meh. To add, Alyx's AI walked right up to every enemy, and died too often. The fights were really intense, though. All being said, the game kind of ended after about three hours and one strider.Overall verdict: intense, even difficult action, but compressed into too little time, squeezing out story.vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvHalf-Life 2 Episode 2. This game is EXCELLENT. If I can say this to the entirety of Steam after knocking the rest of Half-Life 2, I must mean something. Gordon now wakes up inside of the train that crashed. As the train slowly topples over, the obstacle course that you need to climb down changes. I also happen to love changing terrain, so good first impression. Now I begin to notice things. The flashlight that wore out in about ten seconds in the other games was replaced with one much more similar to Half-Life 1. Also on an individual battery, allowing you to dash for more than a few seconds. I gaze deeply into my teammate's eyes, she awkwardly turns away to avoid eye contact. Very human of her. The car is come-and-go. You can struggle through most areas either with or without the car. It lasted just as long as it was needed. and no longer. As for action, there was never a point without it. All was unique, as well. Half-Life 2 got stale, while Episode 1 was overwhelming. Episode 2 managed to get just the right mix of the two, combining into THE perfect balance. Rochelle- I mean, Alyx's AI was realistic, even to the level of the player. Then there's the Gnome. My good friend the Garden Gnome. As a display of how much Valve in the greatest compaby on this side of the universe, you get an achievement for carrying this guy through almost the whole game. While a pain as some points, I kind of grew to like the guy. The ALyx Vance mauled by a Hunter? ""Don't look, Gnome. Shield thou purest of eyes."" It's a showcase of how great the gameplay is. You literally could have taken ANY item throughout the entire game. Now, back on topic. The Characters were recovered to what they should have been. Barney as a security guard. Refugees as refugees. The vortigaunts actually using their green electricity bolts. The characters were essential to the rich storyline. The storyline alone could have made a movie, as it was what made me start rooting for Half-Life 3. Basically, every problem that I have found in any other Half-Life game was remedied in this one fantastic sequel.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Seriously, just buy the game.Now.Sell your house if you really have to.

												And again, not much to say. Episode Two continues where Episode One left off, and is so far the last game in the Half-Life series. Once again you have Alyx as a partner, though you'll spend a part of the game by yourself because of story reasons. There's also a lot more driving around this time. It's about as long as Episode One so if you liked Half-Life 2 and Episode One, you'll probably like this. Though be warned, once you finish this game, you WILL be frustrated with the fact that Valve still hasn't come out with Episode Three or Half-Life 3 yet.			"

												Oh boy, oh boy. What a game. Probably the best in the entire Half-Life series. The pace of the story is simply magnificent. I loved this game so much from start to finish. This covered every area that was lacking in Episode 1. The whole antlion nest chapters and the final chapter was probably some of the most engaging stuff I have experienced in a game.I am glad I picked up the Half-Life series again a few months ago.

												Oh boy, oh boy. What a game. Probably the best in the entire Half-Life series. The pace of the story is simply magnificent. I loved this game so much from start to finish. This covered every area that was lacking in Episode 1. The whole antlion nest chapters and the final chapter was probably some of the most engaging stuff I have experienced in a game.I am glad I picked up the Half-Life series again a few months ago. Half-Life 3/Half-Life 2: Episode 3 couldn't come sooner. Now I wait.			"

												This is the best racing game ever! There's a story, but it gets in the way of driving sections. There's only one race, where you race this ""Dog"" thing, it's a fun race but it's missing music, so I played my own. DAAAAYYYYYTOOOONNNNNAAAA is the song I played while racing. My biggist compaints were that you don't gaet the car until much later and it handles like sh*t. Also for some reason you shoot things, and there's a story, I don't get. I also wish there's free roam, but something about some Sauce engine limits or whatever. Overall, I give it a, G4b3n/3.			"

												Half Life 2 Episode Two continues the story of Gordon Freeman in the open spaces of the road to the White Forrest. It offers more enemies and seems to last longer while the pace varies between intense battles and engaging conversations, providing a rich experience in the Half Life universe. It's remarkable that the vehicles have been introduced back from the original Half Life 2 and we also manage to have an ending that leaves space for sequels. There are a few bugs here and there but overall it's the same Half Life we all know and love but longer that Episdoe One and in my personal opinon better because I was never a fan of urban combat prefered the forests and natural backgrounds beyond City 17.

												This game is probably the best game I have ever played. In comparison to Half Life 2 Episode One this was a breakthrough and I also believe that this game is better than Half Life 2. Within the game there were various mechanics that amaze me and have clearly been worked on for a long time. The story however is the best part of Half Life. This game had emotion that is not seen in most games and the animation with it made it even better. Each part of the game was highly detailed and it did not have any long and boring parts (well, at least for me). This game was brilliant except for the jaw-dropping cliff hanger (why VALVe, why?). This was the only part that annoys me and I still anticipate Half Life 3. Besides that the game was spectacular and I would play this game over most Action/Adventure games.			"

												This review makes no sense if you didn't play Half-Life 2 Episode 2Also spoilers.Half-Life 2: Episode 2 is a science fiction first person shooter developed by Valve Software on the Source Engine. It follows the continued tale of physicist-gone-action-hero Gordon Freeman and action-hero-gone-love-interest Alyx Vance as they drive around a lot and help their garden gnome friend live out his childhood dreams of blowing up in space... I think..Episode 2 is an interesting game... whereas I have generally negative comments to make for HL2 and generally positive comments to make for Episode 1, Episode 2 is a mixed bag. As such, I won't give a traditional review, I'll just list my thoughts in order of what part of the game they apply to... hopefully this is interesting.The very first thing I noticed when playing the game is that the flashlight is no longer tied to the sprint meter which is pretty cool. But I don't get why they can't just impliment that into the other two games with an update... they haven't gone anywhere, as far as I can tell they've been preserved for historical record.The first chapter of Episode 2 throws the player for a loop when (after some exposition + befriending a certain garden gnome) they end up witnessing the generally up-beat and entertaining Alyx get stabbed in the back by a new enemy type. It's a fun twist and they don't sacrifice the duo idea for the sake of plot either, which is nice. Now the player gets to fight alongside a Vort.It's funny how the Vorts went from the bad guys slave guy, to the allies slave guys, to your slave guy... but I digress. After this is a very long section in some mines which try and juggle tricky exploration with the antlions as enemies and honestly I can't say it succedes... The antlions in general just aren't very fun to kill, they're annoying and loud and shooting them isn't satisfying. The environment gets really stale too, it goes on for way too long and you only really fights zombies and antlions for about an hour of gameplay.There are some fun bits, like a sort of stealthy chase sequence with an Antlion Guard (although I wish it were easier to recover after getting caught in corners), and a sort of tower defense part where antlions come swarming in and you fight them alongside some comic relief rebel guys and some Vorts. Come to think of it, Half-Life does a lot of things that sound like bad ideas really well a lot of the time... physics puzzle, excort missions, first person platforming, tower defense set peices, all of those sound like awful ideas.. and usually ARE awful ideas.. but work here due to the execution.But one thing that stays un-fun are the vehicular set-peices... I mean the boat thing is the most tolerable out of all of them but none of them are good anyway! The car is finicky and difficult to control, turning manage sto be both too sensitive and not sensitive enough sometimes and the boost is waaaay too fast. Let alone that the levels you drive in are all covered in logs  and debri and stuff that the car gets caught in, it's just poorly executed. The final level especially bothers me, I mean the striders are objectively satisfying to kill and the sticky bombs are pretty cool, but every time I start having fun in the final level boss fight the car gets stuck or I turn too far and miss my target.I mean some things are fun, and I would argue that the final level as a WHOLE is a success. Crashing into the hunters never gets old and neither does blowing up the striders with a single shot and a sticky bomb. Hearing allies react to stuff you do is always really satisfying too, even if I sort of forgot they were there until the final wave. I think Episode 2 bothers me because it was just so almost my favorite HL2 game but it's shortcoming are so much more glaringly obvious because of that and.. I honestly think some of this is because of lazy design.Either way, Episode 2 is fun. A whole lot of fun. Coupled with Episode 1 it's some of the most fun I've had in a game. The plot is still really investing and the finale is satisfying and then also suddenly kind of horrifying... and the garden gnome will haunt my dreams for months,			"

-Quick Review-Half-Life 2: Episode Two was the last of the weird counting method Valve used to make sure they didn't need to count to three. Half-Life 2: Episode Two was developed by Valve Corporation and released late 2007.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: The story picks up, right where Half-Life 2: Episode One left off; Alyx Vance and Gordon Freeman are going to be reunited with Eli Vance and Dr. Kleiner to plan the next step in their battle against the Combine forces.

Gameplay: This game returns to the more familiar setting of Half-Life 2, you aren't forced to rely solely on the Gravity gun like in most of Half-Life 2: Episode One. There is a new NPC that you encounter called “Hunters”, these are savage killing machines that are very imposing and at times down right freighting when encountered.

Achievements: There are 22 achievements on Half-Life 2: Episode Two. One third of the achievements are unlocked just by playing through the story. The rest are pretty tough and require careful planning, or a very long time running around.The most noteworthy achievements in this game are: Get Some Grub (“Squish every antlion grub in Episode Two” – That took forever.), and Little Rocket Man (requiring you to Carry a Garden Gnome from the beginning of the game to nearly the end) – I have an obsession with garden gnomes because of this achievement, stay away from the precious!

Price: Half-Life 2: Episode Two is priced at $7.99, you're better off purchasing The Orange Box for $19.99, where you will gain all the Half-Life 2 games + Portal 1.Conclusion: I think Half-Life 2: Episode One, and Half-Life 2: Episode Two, really should have been one amazing game. Separate they're short but sweet. To quickly recap, Story: Excellent. Gameplay: nearly identical to the previous games. Achievements: Getting 100% completed will take longer then Half-Life 2, or Episode One. Price: a bit high, but the orange box is an excellent deal for the whole series.I recommend this game to anyone who's played Half-Life 2 and Half-Life 2: Episode One. You don't want to jump into this game, you will want to play the previous games first.Thank you for reading my review!Related reviewsHere's the URL to see my review for  Half-Life 2Here's the URL to see my review for  Half-Life 2: Episode OneHere's the URL to see my review for Half-Life 3 ...(Pleaseeeeee Gabe Newell, my life will be complete... my Half-Life!)

												Yes. Yes. ""Why don't I have a lot of hours"" well to simply put:1) I've played The Orange Box set before....on the console version. 2) There isn't really anything NEW to add other than certain things that the previous episode didn't have or failed to do.With that being said. Let us begin!For my Half Life 2: Episode 1  review click this link:http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronMinotaur/recommended/380Episode 2 made a lot of changes that the previous episode didn't have. For instance, like in my Episode 1 review. I mentioned how everything was crammed in and not a whole lot of ""spacing"" out was put in between genres. For more explanation check the comment section of this review. Anyways in Episode 2 the ""rush feeling"" that was in Episode 1 is thankfully NOT in episode 2. It gives you time with Alyx and really experience what is (for now) the final Half Life game. You get to feel that semi-open world that you witness in Half Life 2 (The main game).And just like in Episode 1. Plot questions have been further explored in this episode. And like what I mentioned in Episode 1. Once again, you won't be given a full explanation until Half Life 3. Sure you got the basic idea of what Half Life 3 is going to be about but realistically not a whole lot of things were answered. It's still a great game to play. Like all Half Life games. I recommend it			"

												I guess it’s pointless to recommend Half-Life 2 in 2013. You’ve probably completed it years ago, or at least have a pretty good idea of what it is and why people like it. So I’ll just use this ‘review’ to recommend a puzzle mod for Episode 2, Research and Development. Simple, but amusing puzzles. Great slapstick humor. Looks really good. There’s plenty of combat too (lobbing things at the enemy for the most part, no actual weapons). Oh, and It’s probably worth checking out just to see Mr. Whirly in action.The mod won’t start out of the box (thanks to the Steampipe update), but it’s easy enough to fix. Just open gameinfo.txt from ‘Steam\steamapps\sourcemods\research and development’ and replace the contents with this stuff[pastebin.com].You can use this technique to fix many of the old HL2 mods, more information here.

												The second sequel to HL2, where you go through some Antlion-infested mines and defend White Forest rebel bases from combine attacks.Liked:-Soundtrack (Sector Sweep is my favorite track in the whole game)-Storyline-The awesome look of the forest setting-The gnome! Sadly I lost him in the mines. I wanted to bring him to the rocket but I couldn't :(-Hunters look pretty cool, as do Antlion Workers and the Magnusson DevicesDisliked:-I was unsure of where to go sometimes, but a lot less than in the other HL2 games-The jalopy seemed to slide too much when I was driving it-No offense to Valve, but Magnusson seems like a ♥♥♥♥ to the resistanceConsiderably the best HL2 game Valve made. 9/10, I would buy this again and recommend it to friends.STRIDERRRRR!!!!

												Why did I complete this game? Oh dear god why?Now my heart will always contain an emptiness that may never be fulfilled. An emptiness that only episode three may deliver. I mourn every single waking day, praying to our lord Gabe, that one day, just possibly that one day, he will bring forth what all of us have been wishfully hoping for. Sadly, that day might not arrive soon enough that our generation may experience it, but hopefully, one day.screw u gabe10/10.			"

												Half-Life 2: Episode 2 is the direct sequel to Half-Life 2: Episode 1 and is the last Half Life game released. So I was expecting something at least semi-interesting since people have been begging for its sequel for almost 10 years now. And while I didn't come away from the ending with my jaw on the floor, agonizing over when I would be able to play its sequel, I did find it to be an enjoyable experience. That's not to say it advances the gameplay of the Half Life series in any revolutionary way. But it does take the series' established characters and gameplay into new and interesting territory. You'll still be using the same weapons, fighting most of the same enemies, and moving around in a familiar manner, but there are some interesting new settings to advance through and some slight twists to gameplay which distinguish it enough from the rest of the games in the series, thus offering more of the satisfying gameplay the Half-Life games have been known for. The story itself is a bit more emotionally tinged this time around. Throughout the journey you'll be to more exposed to the personal thoughts and feelings of the characters than in previous titles. And rest assured the terrffic voice work from past games is still around, and in full form, making these moments worthy of empathy, and instrumental in bringing more life to characters.Graphically there isn't much to write home about as this is a nine year old game, and it is beginning to show its age. But the Half-Life series' famous art design continues to intruige the eyes and mind so unless you're generaly abhorred by older graphics, they shouldn't dampen your enjoyment of the game. All in all, Episode 2 successfully continues to carry the torch of its predecessors and takes the Half-Life series into some interesting, albeit minimal, fresh terrain.			"

												Look, if u didn't play this game yet ... u cannot consider urself as a PC Gamer. This game its a most to play same as the other two, I mean Half life 2 and Half life 2 Episode One. This game has the best storyline, the best character and most of all the best Gman voice scene that u cannot even imagine. Gman scene quotes = Dr Freeman … I realize this moment may not be the most … convenient for a heart to heart but I had to wait until your friends were otherwise occupied. There was a time they cared nothing for Miss Vance, when their only experience of humanity was a crowbar coming at them down a steel corridor. When I … plucked her from Black Mesa hehe, I acted in the face of objections that she was a mere child and of no practical use to anyone, I have learned to ignore such naysayers when quelling them hm ? was out of the question. Still, I am not one to squander my investments, and I remain confident she was worth far more than the initial, appraisal. That's why I must now... extract from you some small repayment owed for your own survival. See her safely to White Forest, Dr. Freeman. I wish I could do more than keep an eye on you, but I have agreed to abide by certain … restrictions. Well now, listen carefully, my dear. When you see your … father, relay these words: ""prepare for unforeseen consequences"".For gameplay and story i give it a 9/10 there is so much blah blah and less gameplay and beside there is much secret to be reveal and still episode 3 doesn't came out ""yet"". For graphic and details coming out from Source Engine its look really pretty and awesome 10/10 on this one ... so like i said if u didn't play this game after 7 years then u better start now...			"

												Another expansion in the form of Episode 2. Again, it's short, nothing ground breaking but does extend the overall games' narrative. It ends abruptly and to date has never let you complete the story and probably never will.

												I have never been a tremendous fan of shooter games. Although I used to play a fair bit of TF2, I always found the genre a bit too repetitive and mindless. Eventually, I decided to play the Half-Life series; after all, it is supposed to be, arguably, the best game series of all time. I played through HL, HL2, and HL:E1. I thought they were quite good for the genre, and certainly had their own moments of brilliance. However, I could never completely understand why they were so unanimously superior to every other game. I finally decided to play Episode 2. Now, I understand.			"

												Another expansion in the form of Episode 2. Again, it's short, nothing ground breaking but does extend the overall games' narrative. It ends abruptly and to date has never let you complete the story and probably never will. There is one shocking death, yet as mentioned in my HL2 review you never know who people are from the first HL so when it happened I had no thoughts on the event and quickly forgot about it.6/10			"

												I have never been a tremendous fan of shooter games. Although I used to play a fair bit of TF2, I always found the genre a bit too repetitive and mindless. Eventually, I decided to play the Half-Life series; after all, it is supposed to be, arguably, the best game series of all time. I played through HL, HL2, and HL:E1. I thought they were quite good for the genre, and certainly had their own moments of brilliance. However, I could never completely understand why they were so unanimously superior to every other game. I finally decided to play Episode 2. Now, I understand.			"

												Episode 2 of the Half-Life franchise following up on the main story, goes in-depth with what happened after the train crashed when the explosion went off, how to save Alyx when she is attacked by a great mechanical hunter, and picking up on all loose nooses as you find your way up to Alyx´s father and the facility in which they have established. After this, the great war that will ensure that the Combine won´t enter the world with a ton of more armies. It definitely is all-round the bases. Again great installment, this one is a LOT more content-filled and challenging in terms of content, and you will be tested in a few new ways previously not known to Half-Life. Definitely a must regardless, especially if you have come this far. Have fun!			"

												In  November 3, 1962 a man was born. This mans name was Gabriel (Gabe) Newell, Gabe grew up to attend harvard university (Rmao this is real information by the way) after flunking out Gabe decided how he could get back on his childhood bully's (Now im ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting xD) so he came with a clever, actually clever sugar coats it... the only word I can think of describing it is an ingenious plan to get back at the world, he decided to create a game (that I will just call Half-Dead for legal reasons,) He came with an ingenious story and after that he decided to wait six painful years for his fans having realised that ending it at half-Dead 2 would not be as catastrophic he decided to be the first recorded mass troll in history he created Half-Dead 2 Episode 1 and Half-Dead episode 2. Episode 2 strangely came with an amazing story that Conveniently ended after 8 years fans are still waiting on Half-Dead Episode 3 will it come out? no Gabe has relished in his revenge at his former hazers, Do I wish it will come out? yes I do but until then I will continue chronically masturbating to Females with Muscles the sized of beach bullies - Lord Trolldemort			"
