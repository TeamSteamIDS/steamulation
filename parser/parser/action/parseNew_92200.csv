												Alright, if you're here, then you probably know what the ""bullet hell"" subgenre is, or at least its parent genre, shoot 'em ups (from now on referred to as ""shmups""), but if not, I'll briefly explain:Shmups are generally defined as any top-down or side-scrolling shooter, such as Galaga, Space Invaders, and many others. Bullet hell games, on the other hand, take this to the EXTREME; some of the screenshots for this game should show you just how many bullets you'll have to deal with. To compensate for this, your character's hit box is extremely small, really only a couple of pixels big, so that this is at all possible.With that out of the way, the actual review!The presentation:Generally pretty good quality sprite work; I wouldn't say it's anything outstanding, but certainly nothing to scoff at. The menus are a tad bland, but function well, and aren't boring; just simple.The story:It's a little hard for me to comment on this one, honestly; the story isn't really well told throughout the game. To give an example of how important the story is, there's an option to disable the pre-level ""cutscenes"", which are only one screen with text and some pictures anyway. I believe it has something to do with humanity doing something dumb, and that causes some evil person to attack (again? I'm not sure; I haven't played the first game), and you, being part of some millitary group, have to go and face her. Not terrible, but not super deep either. But that's probably not why you're here, is it? You're looking for...The gameplay:Is fantastic. Before you start the game, you have the choice between two characters, Eryth and Earl, and another once you beat the true final boss (which, I should mention, I have not done). Now, there are two conflicting sources on the amount of characters; one (this very Steam page) says that there are two starting characters, with the unlockable third, while the games official webpage states that there are FIVE characters, along with an unlockable sixth. Neither of these are completely correct. The second character, Earl, is actually a customizable character; you can use one of four presets, or you can mix and match her three selectable abilities. These abilities, of which Eryth has as well (however, Eryth is stuck with one skillset), include your normal shots, ""bombs"" (which almost never actually includes using a bomb), and ""Mana Action"", which requires your Mana bar to be filled up; this can be done by killing enemies. The game isn't too long, probably about an hour or less if your good; but that's a pretty tall order. The first time I played through this game (playing as Eryth, Revised (normal) difficulty), it took about two hours of multiple retries to get past these five stages. Despite the difficulty (which is pretty normal for these kinds of games), I had a blast, and felt extremely satisfied once I finally conquered it. Thanks in no small part to...The music:Now, personally, I loved the music. It's probably one of my favorite game soundtracks, and I'm not exaggerating; I rank this up there with Cave Story, Mega Man X, BlazBlue (the collective series), all of those amazing soundtracks. And the soundtrack actually comes including in the Steam folder for the game once it's installed, so that's a huge plus. However, looking at another review, it said that the musical wasn't all that great. So who knows, I might be in the minority on this one.Overall:Hopefully this review didn't end up being too long-winded; I don't exactly have a lot of experience with reviewing. However, I found myself having to hold back on how much I said, because I quite bluntly love this game. It's one of my favorites, and I'm pretty sure the next few days will be spent on getting the achievements. I hope you decide to pick this game up, because it's definitely worth it; I plan on buying the other games in the series at some point soon as well.			"

												Although not as strong with it's gameplay as Gundeadligne, Gundemonium has superior visuals and a fantastic soundtrack.This game is better for a single player experience!Gundeadligne:-Multiplayer but sadly rare that anyone plays so get a friend, in-game it suddenly gets insane at difficulty 21 (Demonic).-Visuals less detailed and has outline better for seperating the background from the foreground.Gundemonium:-Single player but is strong with it's levels and has a better climb in difficulty compared with Gundeadligne.-Visuals sharper and more detailed but can be difficult to look at over the background at times (especially later level 3).Both equally good games but for different reasons.

												One of the first 'true' shumps on steam, and oh boy is this sucker a doozy! Devloped back in 2007, retooled slightly for 2011 and brought towards English readers, this game is a blast. Just. A. Total. Blast. But yee be warned if you are new, or still lacking skill in shumps in general: This game will chew you up, and toss you away hard. It doens't pull it's punches even on it's more easier setting, to pass it's insane challanges, fight it's 'true' end game boss, and to unlock the third playable cast member is something maybe only 1% of the people who buy/play this game will EVER achive.Not for the faint of heart, but those looking for an extremly thrilling challange need not look elsewhere.

												I purchased Gundemonium Recollection while it was on sale and have enjoyed it a lot.It's a horizontal shoot em up. Gameplay is difficult, but not unfair. Also if you're not worried about deaths, the game allows you to continue from the start of the stage you died in.  I love the music. I've left the game on the title screen just to hear the theme.Allows full controller support. I'm using a 3rd party ps3 controller. It also allowed button remapping.			"

												It would be against my standards not to reccomend a game made by Aeju Murasame. This and the other games in the Gundemonium bundle are the first of his games to be officially released overseas, but he is well-known in Japan, and it shows. The graphics are sublime, the game runs super-smoothly in most recent PCs, and the game system assures you think your tactics carefully if you wanna score high and unlock stuff. Plus, the remixed music is awesome, and unlike in the PS3 release, censorship is optional (There are a few lightly-dressed anime chicks in this game. <.<). Do you like Bullet Hell games? Have you played Touhou, but are FED UP of it (Like me) and want to try something different? Then buy the full bundle. You will not regret it at all.			"

												So, you want to play a Shoot Em Up, do you? Well this game is definitely a good one to start with.The game has four controls, plus 8-way movement. It's a side scroller, like the Gradius games, but it has no powerups. You use what the character you select has, as well as one of four alternate costumes which change their way of playing.Music in this game is what you'd expect from a game from overseas; really good. It's not overbearing, and you can hear everything in the game without the music blocking anything. Plenty of different songs in each level, too.Level design goes from Easy to moderate to a bit tough to really tough to ""If you are not godlike, quit now"" tough. Difficulty ramps up REALLY fast towards the third level, which is only 10~ minutes in. The fifth level is just incredibly brutal, and this isn't even a hard game. Consider it an entry to Bullet Hells, because this is only the tip.A great game for beginners to learn the fear of Bullet Hell games. I'd like to think of myself as a fan of shooters, and I own a few on consoles, but Bullet Hells continue to make me realize that I haven't even begun playing hard games. Get this if you want an introductory to a challenging genre of games that actually takes some skill.			"

Posted: January 9, 2012
												Gundemonium Recollection is a side-scrolling shooter, and is the first in the Gundemonium trilogy. I have really tried to understand this game, but the game refuses to let me know what's going on. No tutorial, no explanation of what's going on, no explanation of the buttons, moves or attacks. Obviously, the basic shooting action is easy enough to grasp, but without understanding how the bombs and special attacks work, you can't really succeed at the game.Shooter fans that are looking for a challenge and are willing to research this game to figure it out may enjoy it. Also, if you don't mind just blindly shooting at things and dying a bunch, you may be able to forgive this game's flaws. For most people, however, I'd recommend passing this one up, unless you can find it for under a dollar.UPDATE: I've had a few complaints come in, so I'm going to address a few of the points I missed the first time around.First, the manual. Yes, there's a manual, and yes, it teaches you basically everything you need to know about playing the game. No, it's not good enough, and no, it doesn't replace the missing tutorial. Here's the first problem: I didn't have access to the manual when I played the game initially. I was traveling and had no Internet connection, which is a huge problem when the online manual is required reading to enjoy the game. Also, game manuals haven't been required reading for basically any game made since 1990. Most manuals made today only contain basic troubleshooting information for the game, so the manual is not where I would have thought to look for basic gameplay instructions. I mean, seriously, it doesn't take that much effort to put in a basic, working tutorial. Why didn't the developers care enough to include one?Also, this game is fairly complex, which is unfortunate because the game is so inelegant. There are lots of little meters and little rules quirks you're just expected to know about. There are plenty of bullet hell shooters that have rich gameplay with a relatively simple set of rules. This is not one of them.Second, the controls. If you're playing on a keyboard, the control menu is simply baffling. Not only do you not have the option to freely bind the keys, but the game also doesn't adequately tell you what the current bindings are. Fire is ""01""? Which key is that? If you think it's the 1 key, you're wrong. It's the space bar.Third, the story. Yes, I read the blurb at the start. It makes little sense. It's a giant wave of jargon with almost no meaning, and the inter-level blurbs are similarly void of semantics. It doesn't adequately explain what's going on.As for the gameplay, I'm willing to take back a little of what I initially said, since the manual addresses a few of my concerns. That said, as far as bullet hell shooters go, this is still on the lower end of quality.I still don't recommend this game. This game is very lazily made, and fans of bullet hell shooters deserve better. Thankfully, there are better ones out there, though I'm not aware of any that are currently on Steam (Ikaruga's not on Steam yet).			"

												A stunningly hard shooter on par with Zero wing. Pleasant to look at and gorgeous soundtrack, means grinding through the same level 70+ times to pass will not be as painful as one might think.The ending is hard enough to get to, and relatively rewarding enough that actually beating this game gives that rarest of gaming feelings: Satisfaction.Well worth it.

												First game of the Gundemonium series remade with a few changes. As with true Shmup genre the hitbox is the pendant on your character chest. As there are a bunch of buttons it gets confusing at first but if you focus on dodging you only need to worry about shot and bomb. Falling in the scoring shmup category there are a lot of interesting ways to increase high score. Demonic shift which allows the phase level of 11 regardless of current phase level, which can allow to be a saving grace or an early start on high scoring. Alot of customization with the 2nd available character you can play any style you wish.			"

												Love this game, super fun and I definitely recommend it to anyone thinking about it. The only thing I would love to see would be if you could add steam trading cards. I don't know how that works though so if you can't I understand, it would just be a cool addition.			"

												 Gundemonium is a wonderful 2d side scroller shum'p, specially with a controller the options menu have the option for make the game oldschool 1 hit kill, but I don't use this because I found the game pretty hard even with 3 hit kill, there is also multiple difficult setings, definitively one of my favorite shum'ps+awesome soundtrack+bullethell gameplay+creative enemies10/10			"

												A great bullet hell/danmaku game that should be perfect for any fan of the genre. To be honest, I wouldn't recommend it as a starting point for someone to get into the genre, seeing as there are far more mechanics present than most bullet hell games. However, if you already know that you enjoy similar games, I can't see any reason why you wouldn't enjoy this game.			"

												If you like bullet hell shooters then you will love Gundemonium Recollection. Definitely the best in the series by far it's anime style is perfect & it's sound is more than adequate. It's challenge however is really high as the easiest mode will still kick your bootay... Never played a bullet hell shooter? then you are in for a surprise trust me... Definitely old school material. Weak hearts need not apply.			"

												My favorite bullet hell, I simply love it. It's fresh, fast, cool and it made me say ""how the ♥♥♥♥ am I suppost to pass this!?"" millions of time, and when I finally completed the last stage I felt good! I FELT ♥♥♥♥IN GOOD! Finishing games like this makes you feel emotions that other games doesn't. Awesome soundtrack. A fast gameplay that will leave you breathless. 2nd customizable character. Secret unlockable game-mode. Plenty of challenging achievements. ours of deep fun.9/10. If you like 2d shooter buy it.			"

												Gundemonium is a normal shmup in a lot of ways, but with a couple of unique twists. You've got your normal shmup fare, attack, special attack, bomb... there's also a neat rapid fire attack that will overheat a certain character's guns if you use and on another it's worthless. The most unique thing in this game is the phase level mechanic. Depending on what difficulty you start on, your phase level will change, with demonic locked in at 11. The higher your phase level, the harder the game is. You can lower your phase level by getting hit or using a bomb, or raise it by beating a boss or using a bomb just as you get hit, also known as counter bombing.Your hitbox is very small in comparison to your large sprite, which allows bullets to cover most of your body without you getting hit. Personally, I would prefer a larger hitbox or a smaller sprite, but it isn't a big deal. Espcially considering this game's difficulty. It's a pretty difficult game. Do not buy this if you are not prepared to die often. That's really the only reason to stay away, or if you just don't like bullet hell games. I love this game, and I highly reccomend it.			"

												BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT!.... have you bought it yet?Well, while we're all here, talking about Gundemonum, do you (YES YOU!) like to shoot things? Hmm, I sure knew you would! Well... do you like shooting things, taking control of a cute main character? Oho! That's two for two I bet! Well, how about encountering wave after wave of relentless enemies, with the soul purpose to kill you as you fly shoot, dodge bomb and mameover past five stages of intense gun toting action, you will encounter mid bosses, PLENTY OF THEM, and dawnting stage bosses that will give you a run for your money (which you WILL use to buy this). Do you have what it takes to complete Casual Mode without the use of a continue? Just the easiest setting! C'mon, I dare ya! Or are you AFRAID after admitting to all of the above?.... HAVE YOU BOUGHT IT YET?!			"

												The most polished shooter in the Gundemonium series. This horizontal shmup plays like a vertical shmup, complete with two movement speeds, subweapons, and a complicated ranking system that dynamically adjusts the difficulty based on how you play.Waves of enemies are passed by killing a certain number of enemies in that wave, and picking up extends and bombs on later waves incentivizes strong offensive play. Difficulty levels start off trivial but end in the realm of impossible, with normal only really becoming uncomfortable near the end. The game is loaded with extra missions and features, and you can even customize the Earl Type ships, but Eryth is still the main character and therefore the best.			"
