												Turn Clue into a first-person shooter on 1920's era luxury liners, sprinkle in bits of The Sims, and you've got The Ship. Instead of having to uncover a killer, The Ship makes you the killer. To be more specific and familiar to the gaming audience, The Ship is a very polished and creative take on the Assassin's Creed Multiplayer experience (but also keep in mind that this game came before the Assassin's Creed Multiplayer genre was released)....where the main gameplay mechanic revolves around finding your target, called your quarry, and breaking their face as stealthily as possible. To do so, there are plenty of lethal weapons and objects to wield, and even some environmental traps that you will find yourself potentially avoiding. To add flavor, everyone else on each map has a quarry as well. While pursuing your own target, you'll need to stay alert and attempt to spot the passenger readying a knife for your back. The Sims element of the game, quells upon your daily needs to survive (food, drinks, toilet, sleep, etc). The 'character's needs' element makes for a deeper gameplay experience, as your character is vulnerable to attack while you're downing a bag of chips or snoring on a bed. And it is surely funny when your friend murders you on the toilet. The Ship is one of very few games that brings a large amount of enjoyment to my friends and I. Built on Valve's Souce engine, a majority of gamers can experience a $20 title with basically 4 copies to gift away. A little too much? Ask four of your friends for $4 each, and your all set! Overall, The Ship is a very innovative, satisfying and humorous experience that a bunch of 5 friends can't pass up. ""Let us set sail!.""			"

												This is the Multiplayer portion of The Ship. I said I didn't like the singleplayer, but the multiplayer is a totally different story.Also another little note, at time of writing, the in-game server browser is broken. You can find games through Steam (Steam Window: View > Servers > Change Filters > set game to The Ship).The Ship seems to be a lesser known, yet highly underrated game about murdering other people without being spotted. It's a true blue stealth game in that you actually have to kill your quarry without being seen by anyone. If you pull out a weapon in front of a guard, security camera, or are seen holding one for too long by other players, you get arrested and penalized. The game also punishes random deathmatching, so players have less incentive to grief. The game is really tense because everyone is a target. while you're hunting your target, someone else is hunting you, and you have no idea who it is until they start looking shifty, make a move on you, or kill you.It also combines a little bit of The Sims in that you have to manage your needs: hunger, thirst, toilet, cleanliness, boredom, fatigue, socialization... All the while trying to hunt down your quarry. The game also encourages mixing up your murder weapons by increasing the money you get for a kill with a given weapon the longer it goes without being used. Once a weapon is used, it drops to the bottom of the list and only gives you the minimum payout.The game is a buttload of fun and deserves more love and attention. This game also comes with a bunch of copies that you can give to friends. I highly recommend it, especially if you can pick it up during a sale.			"

												The Ship is an amalgam. It combines gameplay genres in satisfying and entertaining ways. Whereas many games that incorporate multiple genres end up as generic experiments gone wrong, The Ship not only manages to keep from sinking, but sets sails for the high seas of adventure. This is one seriously imaginative game. While certain elements may remind you of other popular games, The Ship manages to combine these elements to create a unique concept in gaming. Essentially a murder mystery, The Ship combines elements of the whodunnit classic board game Clue with shooter elements, in addition to some personal management features not unlike The Sims. There's lots of action, tasks, strategy, and laughs to be had. You can play with others online or offline with bots. Each mode has its own good and bad points, but the good points outweigh bad.The unique part is that this means that you yourself are someone's target, and must avoid being killed by your secret stalker while you're looking for your own target.The basic idea behind The Ship is that you play out a murder mystery on a luxury liner that's decked out in the art-deco style of the 1920s. But this isn't an adventure game, despite the Agatha Christie premise. A first-person perspective and maps loaded with narrow corridors and small rooms make the game feel like a shooter, although instead of blasting everyone in sight, you're assigned to kill a specific victim on the sly for cash, and his or her current location is updated at the bottom right of the screen every 30 seconds. Instead of blasting away with shotguns and BFGs, you mainly do your dirty deeds with improvised weapons such as golf clubs, letter openers, barbecue tongs, and croquet mallets. The Ship brings a hilarious, fun, yet totally odd style to the first person shooter community.  When most players are playing along, this game is a blast and there are some really great moments to be seen here.  The single player mode leaves a bit to be desired, as it mostly just acts as practice for online play, but it's still actually pretty usable and fun.  For its budget price, it won't work if you're looking for great graphics or a lot of all-out action, but once you get into the game's wacky style of play I think you'll find it's wonderful and very satisfying.

												I spent about 2 hours playing this with a couple friends today, and as another review had said, it is autistically fun. Playing the ""World Leaders"" mode is absoutely the most hilarious thing I've experienced in a videogame thus far. Becoming George W. Bush and being assigned to take out Margaret Thatcher, you just can't beat. On a satisfaction scale from Fruit Stripe gum to a guilt free blowjay, I give this game a ""Sneeze that's been holding back for half an hour"".			"

Yes, the graphics are a bit dated, but if you put three or four computers in the same room running the game and get people started... there's nothing like killing your friends. ""That was you?""

												Does anyone remember when Assassin's Creed announced it would have a multiplayer mode for the first time? I sure do, because at the time, all I thought was that they were ripping off the ship.I was wrong. AC multi is a lot worse.The Ship is one of the best multiplayer experiences on the internet. It's a combination Assassin's Creed, The Sims, and a little Madworld mixed in.Players are stranded together inside one of several large cruise ships as a random skin, populated with a large host of NPCs as well. Each player has a target, who they recieve a face for and nothing else. Their job is to find that player on the ship and kill them. The trick is that you lose points if you kill anyone you're not hunting or being hunted by, including said npcs. There are cameras at various locations around the ship, which will cause you to get arrested and timed out if caught brandishing weapons openly. However, you have a set of needs such as hunger, thirst, hygeine, bladder and sleep, similar to The Sims, which force you to keep moving to meet them, usually away from the cameras. Your goal is to act as much like the unassuming NPCs as possible, both to avoid detection from those hunting you and to disguise yourself from the prey you're tailing, all while managing your meters and picking up the weapons you'll need to secure the kill.There's a huge host of weapons and environmental hazards with which to do so, and point values for each vary wildly over time. This forces players who want to stay on top to constantly be changing their tactics and style. Certain weapons can only be found in specific locations on each ship, so highly desired gear can become choke points which force players to meet similar to Q3A duels.The ship is full of more than weapons, though. In addition to portable food items which can restore health or your need meters in a pinch, most guests board with more than the clothes on their backs. By raiding their rooms for garments, you can swap out your clothing if you think you're being followed or after each kill to disguise yourself and throw the other players off your scent. You can't change your face, but someone following to the side or behind may think you're an NPC and move on.The result of all this craziness is a really clever form of deathmatch that uses true stealth and deception, because you're trying to trick other players instead of AI. Stalking prey feels really rewarding and so does tricking your attacker into revealing themselves under a camera or turning a corner and unexpectedly fighting back. The ticking time from your meters at the bottom, the rapidly changing point structure and high ranking players attracting more hunters make the pressure always on and puts players on their toes.If all this seems right up your alley, wait unless you're super eager and have nothing better to do. The Ship is getting an HD version in early 2016, though as far as anyone can tell right now, it will be multiplayer only. The Ship also has a singleplayer campaign, though it's not nearly as fun imho. The unique aspect of Ship combat is pvp stealth and sneaking up on Sims in their sleep feels more like a clunky, uglier Hitman Absolution.			"

												Think ""The Sims"" crossing over with ""Assassin's Creed"", you are all random shipmates with individual pseudonyms aboard a variety of different and even exotic vessels for maps. Your main objective: Kill your designated quarry, whilst watching out for other competing hunters, and tending to  your own basic human needs; hunger, sleep, boredom, hygiene, and using the facilities (Make sure you close the door first!).And proclaim your prominence as the dominant hunter, with a comedic arsenal of fun assertives such as: A Tommy gun, Blunderbuss', shanks, Wallet-bombs, and even Mannequin Arms. Just don't get caught by the fuzz when commiting your dasterdly deeds!There's just nothing more amusing than whipping out a full automatic, and eviscerating your best friends while they're busy ""passing time on the porcelain throne""... *sighs happily* Good times.All in all...

												The Ship is definitely not your usual first-person shooter, where you just shoot anything that looks at you funny - although there is a game mode for that.It feeds on your cleverness and paranoia. Each game round, you have to kill on specific person onboard one of several ocean liners - the titular Ships - and at the same time, someone is hunting you. Both you and your target - or 'quarry' - can take cover under the watchful eye of a Security Guard or Camera, but your hunter will likely be quite happy to bribe the Security to ignore their crimes while they bring that big ol' bat of theirs and beat your ♥♥♥ to death with it.Each other player you meet is a potential threat, and whether they come right at you wielding axe or gun, or sneak around and try to whack you from behind or lure you into a trap is up to them.But, again, it's not just that simple - the winner of the match is decided by who has earned the most money for their kills at the end, and each weapon has a randomized and steadily increasing price for its use, be it Frying Pan, Revolver, Flare Gun, Umbrella or Wallet Bomb. Once the weapon is used, its price drops down to a measely $100. Thankfully, you have access to a list that shows which weapons are paying out the highest. It's up to you to find them, mind.While all of this is going on, your character has needs of their own - hunger, exhaustion, hygiene and growing loneliness all play a factor, and the longer you're alive, the harder it becomes to stay that way.The environments are beautifully stylized. Each map has a different theme while sticking to a creepy, paranoia-fuelling atmosphere. The larger ships are a little dark and foreboding, while the smaller ones are much more colorful and fun. As the amount of people out for your blood increases, the atmosphere and your sanity darkens.Every ship is laid out completely differently, from the very simple to the aggressively complex. Learning the maps and where to find hiding spots and secrets is the key to success.The character design is quite cartoony, something between TF2 and TellTale characters. It fits the tone very well, being neither silly nor realistic.The sound design is just marvellous. Every weapon impact on your quarry is satisfying, my personal favorite being the 'THWANG' of the Frying Pan or Cooking Pot. Old timey music plays through every radio and in every bar and restaurant, footsteps getting louder behind you make your heart jump, the wind, splashing water and airhorn blasts outside make you chill, and... well, let's say your character's visit to the bathroom is... descriptive.If I have to criticize it, I will say the AI bots are very thick, more concerned with wandering about like cattle, more grazing, sleeping and pooping than hunting, only engaging in combat when they happen upon their quarry by chance.All in all, I love this game. An exciting, fast-paced murdery romp on the high seas, combining regular first-person combat skills with strategy, planning and lunatic paranoia. There is a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be totally enthralled.			"

												This is a fantastic game especially for one that was created all the way back in 2006. You forget that it is 10 years old when you are playing; this is mainly due to the fact that it is a concept that is currently unrivalled when compared to games of today. Admittedly, it takes a fair amount of effort to create a multiplayer game; the server has to be hosted by a member of your party as there are no public servers available (This requires forwarding of port 27105). Other than that, it's an easy game to get into. The basic premise of the game is that you have to hunt for your quarry, while being hunted. You get a list of the best priced weapons when pressing M, if you find these and kill your quarry without being detected and therefore detained, you will get a higher amount of money. There are various maps, all of which are fairly good, these can be selected with console commands. The spare slots in the server are populated with a fairly good AI.If I can offer one piece of advice, it's keep an eye on the people around you, and watch that eye.My only complaint is that this game is so old, if it was revamped and brought into today's standards; I could imagine an even greater game would be born.

												The ship is an interesting game that has a lot to offer. If I had to describe it I would say it's like the Sims and the Assassin's creed multiplayer combined, all along with a rather interesting art style. It is like the Sims in that your character has persistent needs throughout the game that you must deal with, and along with the hunt and hunted type pvp you'll be doing means you have to balance killing your target, hiding from the person hunting you, and making sure your hygene, hunger, tiredness and other statuses are fullfilled. The game also features an ecconomy where you get money for kills and this can be spent on items or supplies to refill hunger or thrist.Overall the game is a boat load of fun and it gets even better with friends, if you and some friends can buy this together it should keep you entertained for a while. I've not seen any downsides yet and the only one I could list is if you don't really like this type of pvp multiplayer.			"

												This game sells itself short. Well, it fails to sell itself at all really. Gifted to me by a friend, who was equally unsure of the game, I thought I would give it a try. What an excellent addition to my 2013 collection The Ship turned out to be. Just in the nick of time as well!To put it simply, you're a predetermined character on a ship and are given a mark. Similarly, another character has been given you as their mark, so you can't just run round willy-nilly. If you ever watched Ace Ventura as a child then you'll catch the game's drift fairly quickly. You're on a hunt - for humans. Varied weapon choice provides replayability and good humour. There are plenty of bizarre and wonderful weapon to find and take out your mark with, each with a reward. Bat someone with an umbrella in a public place and you'll be well remunerated. Similarly, tipping hats to Cluedo and whacking someone with a candlestick will also get you big bucks.Considering that the sole goal of the game is to commit murder, The Ship is surprisingly light-hearted and amusing. It's one of those games you can dip in and out of without getting hooked, but get quick jollies from. I've thoroughly enjoyed this somewhat hidden gem and would recommend it highly. "

Most of the time nobody trust no one and you spend your time following and running. It is very easy to play and learn. Whenever you die or get into the prison (because you tried to use your weapon while people were watching) you start over, but you can find weapon and other stuff you need in the closets very easily. You basically gear up from scratch every time and start hunting. So easy and fun.			"

												An amazingly made game which should definitely be noticed. It revolves around a ship which is suspiciously marooned or something, away from any chance of rescue. The strange Mr. X - the complete leader of the ship with a strange kind of Russian accent - orders the ship's passengers to kill or be killed.You get a quarry to kill in the Multiplayer. But there's a twist... you're being hunted. And so the main aim is to stay alive with the Sim-like twist you have to fulfil your needs so you don't die of having to go to the ♥♥♥♥ or starve.In the Singleplayer, you're tasked with incredibly unique missions, and eventually you will complete the game.One-of a kind.

												This is one of the first games I purchased on steam and It's honestly one of the best games out there. You're given a quarry to find and murder and you're someone else's quarry for them to find and kill but you have to be sneaky and wary of your surroundings, if you're spotted with weapons drawn you'll be arrested and most likely miss your chance to get to your quarry. The weapons (frying pans, scalpel, syringes full of poisonous liquids) have different worth's and the better the worth the more money you will gain from killing your quarry with them with the worth changing on each round, The player that gets to a certain amount of cash wins. If dealing with all that wasn't enough you have to compete with your own body, you have to deal with hunger, thirst, hygiene (sort of like the Sims)  and if you don't shower often enough you will turn into dust and perish.I murdered my quarry while they were on the toilet with a blunderbuss. That's the kind of game this is.			"

The ShipThe Ship is a fun semi-realistic multi-player game that takes place is a semi-modern early 1910's. The game modes consist of Hunt(You have a name of another player/CPU and you must find him/her and kill them without getting arrested or killed yourself), Team Elimination(Simple; Two teams find and kill each member of the opposing team), Death-match(Kill everyone), Duel(One-on-one battle), and Team VIP(Kill the enemies teams, VIP whilst keeping yours safe). I gotta' admit it, It's a very fun multi-player game. I especially like the realism aspects such as, Thirst, blatter, colon, hunger, sleep, entertainment, loneliness, and some more(If I remember correctly). If you fail to attend to those needs, Your player will die in a unique way according to which thing you forgot to attend to. Anyway, In conclusion; The Ship is an awesome multi-player game and I for sure, suggest that you guys should try it out.RatingsCategoryRating

												The Ship is a game where you hunt other people while being hunted yourself.Ever played Assassin's Creed's Hunt mode or Trouble in Terrorist Town? This is very similar.The main difference between The Ship and those games is its Sims-like needs system.This concept may be foreign to people unfamiliar with The Ship, but eating and drinking are essential to not dying.Too hungry? You die.Too thirsty? You die.Too tired? You fall asleep and somebody literally stabs you in the back.Managing one's needs is a way The Ship forces players into the open.Just skip the Single Player game, it's agonizingly slow and boring.

												This game is one of the most unique, creative, and best multiplayer games that there is. It requires you to be a lot more strategic compared to other games in the FPS genre. Every round, you are given a random person (called a Quarry in the game) that you have to try to hunt down and eliminate without being caught by security guards, security cameras, or witnesses. If you get caught, then you go to jail for a bit. But at the same time, you have someone that is also trying to hunt you down and eliminate you in a stealthy manner as well. Every so often, you are notified of the location where your Quarry is/was. But your Hunter is also notified of the location where you are/were every so often as well. So it's a constant feeling of uneasiness because you can't really trust anybody as you're moving around the ship. And you're trying to eliminate your Quarry while also trying to not get eliminated by your Hunter (and you don't know who your Hunter is). If you eliminate an innocent (someone that is not your Quarry or your Hunter), your character loses money. And if you eliminate too many innocents and put your character in a lot of debt, you automatically get kicked and temporarily suspended from the server for 1 hour. Another good thing about this game is that all of the characters have real human needs that need to be attended to every so often. These needs include eating, having a drink, going to the washroom, showering/bathing, sleeping, socializing, reading something, etc. Having to attend to these needs prevents players from just camping the whole time. If a character's needs are ignored, then there are consequences such as the character naturally dying. Or falling on the floor and going to sleep for a bit which makes you completely defenseless against your Hunter if they find you. So the requirement of having to attend to real human needs every so often is one of the things that makes this game so unique and different from the rest of the FPS genre. The game also requires you to use different weapons/methods towards eliminating your Quarry each round. Eliminating your Quarry with the same weapon repeatedly every round results in very little award money for you. Each round, the weapons get a different award money amount based on which weapons have been used the most so far in the match. The weapons and items that you will find as you search around are randomized. The Ship also has a pretty decent single player campaign/story. And it also has a tutorial for new players to teach them the basics of playing the game. The game can be played by yourself offline with bots or online with other people (and bots if wanted). You can host your own server by yourself (playing with bots at first) that other people can join (players that join replace the bots). The game also has different gamemodes and maps as well. This game is very deserving of a lot more online players than it currently has. So I definitely recommend The Ship for people that are looking for a multiplayer game that's very unique, creative, and different!			"

(and to vary, everyone loose their ♥♥♥♥ing head by that)The Ship can´t be more big than it is, 5 covered, and going to end with the same fate of the ""Titanic""(looks like big ships can´t coexist without being sunk) but you have an usefull map which indicates objetives in every moment so you can´t be like a missing turistic in a new country.But this is not you average boring ship, is a completely facking mafia from the inside, conspirancy ,hitmans, even yakuzas....Packed with weapons in every corner, lockers, and every single room you can find (i don´t know how this ship was ongoing)To make thing harder than it already is, your character things he is in some kind of ""Sims"" game, he has needs...everytime.....Oh God...a ♥♥♥♥ing kid.10 missions to complete, to get a wtf ending But despite the negative facts, it has a good dynamic, and good idea from base. Is a good way to go later with the multiplayer (When the fun doesn´t end neither). "

												This game is a fantastic group experience for anyone wanting to spend an evening stabbing your friends in the back. The Offline part is garbage, and playing the online multiplayer is decent fun, but the game truly shines when you have a large group of friends (4+) on a private server taunting eachother over voice chat and screaming in panic when you pull the shotgun. If you're flying solo, then keep on browsing, but if you've got friends to VC with, this game earns a flawless 10/10.The only downside is that, rather than fix the server issues (There are no dedicated servers, you have to find publicly run servers to play on or make one yourself.) They instead released a worse version of the game under the pretense of it being a ""remastering."" The new version straight up removes some of the game elements and changes others,  while adding little, if any to compensate.Worst of all, in my opinion, is that with the release of a re-mastering, they've removed the ability to buy a 5 pack of the Ship for 20 dollars. 5 friends tossing 4$ in the hat was the single greatest purchase I've ever made on steam, but asking each person to pony up 10$, especially when the game's most fun with friends? They properly shot themselves in the foot with that.TL;DR This old version is better than the remastered one, and the game is best experienced with friends, voice chat, and perhaps just a little alcohol.

												Multiplayer:Fun as hell if you're playing it with friends. Knowing that one of your friends might be the one who is assigned to kill you  (or maybe you're the one who's quarry is your friend) makes the whole thing funny while you are Skyping or smtn.Singleplayer:It's quite short and the story is pretty much meh. All you gotta to do, are some tasks given by the Bellboy. Those aren't the ""Kill that guy""  objectives only. Hard difficulty makes your butt clench very hard, especially while fighting with the melee weapons.Overall: Mostly it's a multiplayer fun - lots of maps, weapons, interactions... Interactions kinda reminded me of The Sims. Even the animations and characters looked like from The Sims. Ships are confusing at first and walking around non-stop might affect your patience, because sprinting drains fast and restores slowly. Also, your character needs drain annoyingly fast.No achievements, SP is short, MP is fun while playing it with friends only, in my opinion. Wait for the sale, it's not worth 10 euros.6/10Btw, why the ♥♥♥♥ there are 3 different downloads for this game - MP, SP and even the Tutorial needs to be downloaded???			"

												The Ship is a very fun murder game where you have different ways of murding someone and different gamemodes.Gameplay: The gameplay is great as you must kill your victim, but you can't be seen by a witness, camera or a security guard. The style of gameplay is great as the game makes you use a different  weapon to earn more cash than using the same weapon.Gamemodes: There isn't just one gamemode where you have to kill your quarry, but there are different types like that. Take deathmatch for instance: kill anyone you see. That gamemode is good for people who like having a bloodbath and going on ruthless killing sprees. Or there is The Hunt: you must hunt your specific target before the time limit, and you must protect yourself from your hunter as everyone on the boat is a quarry. The Hunt teaches you not to kill everyone you meet straight away.Conclusion: The game is a brilliant massacre on a boat and I love throwing a wallet/purse bomb into a small room with loads in. 10/10  Would kill someone with a cane again...

												The ship is a very interesting idea for the game. It has potential to be somehting GREAT. When you buy this game, you will find three new games in your library (The Ship, The Ship Single Player, The Ship Tutorial) - I will go over each one.The Ship is the heart and soul of the game, and is what could be amazing about it. Basically, all the players have a ""mark"" on one of the other players, but nobody knows who you're hunting which can provide interesting scenarios. To spice things up, you cannot kill or even bear a weapon while being watched by civilians, guards or cameras. This means, you could lure a potential hunter into a trap! This sense of an almost ""stalemate"" makes things very interesting and with enough dedicated players could make this one of the most interesting and enjoyable games here. The problem is, the servers are down so you have to manually join servers - not too big a hassle, but it is definitely inconvenient, especially when trying to play with friends. Also, from what I've seen, not too many active player hosted servers.I expected the Ship Single player to be the same as online except with bots - essentially be a ""training area"" for noobies. It is instead, a very short campaign with no options to play ""multiplayer except with bots"" unfortnately. Like I said, the campaign is very short, it is unrewarding, has annoying voice acting and is terribly unrewarding. The ""levels"" if you want to call them that can be too easy or ridiculously unfair out of nowehere. The most annoying part is one slip up (even if just caught with a weapon) all the progress yo made in that level is restarted, which means more walking across the ship to talk to the annoying sounding characters. Campaign can be beaten in about 1 to 2 hours depending on how fast you are at it, and if you want to ""role play"" or not. The game also has really annoying mechanics. You have various needs sor tof like a sim game, which would be fine, if they didn't randomly have to be upkept every two seconds. The most annoying is the ""sprinting"" in this game, which is the alternative to walking very slowly. The so called ""sprinting"" is tremendously slow and runs out of energy almost immediately. You get about 2 seconds max at sprinting to then have to wait for about 10+ seconds before you can do it again. The killing animations are hilarious, so killing other players is the highlight of the game, to be honest, which seems to be lacking in variety in the campaign - hence why the multiplayer could be so good!The tutorial is short lasting, covers all the mechanics of the game and is pretty important to ""play"" just to make sure you know what you're doing. Why the three games weren't integrated as one, I'll never know. The tutorial speaker, however, talks incredibly slow and waits long amounts of time before going on to the next thing she needs to say - this gets annoying very fast.I know it sounds like I am just complaining about the game - which hoenstly my review is mostly that. With that said it is not a terrible game and when on sale for 5$ I think this is one everyone should pick up. BUT PLEASE PUT THE SERVERS BACK UP DEVS. This game has gret potential and I know it can be enjoyable despite the annoyances. At its current state, however, I cannot recommend it.+GREAT potential in multiplayer+Funny killing animations-Outdated graphics-Annoying mechanics (read review)-Servers not up in-game			"

												I'll start with the Con's. Graphics not very good anymore. Annoying music keeps looping in levels. Built-in server browser is not working so you need to manually add servers for multiplayers. And then the good.... Well good sides goes something like this: I lurk around the ship corridors nervously looking for my target while avoiding exposing my back to others too much. One can never know when YOUR killer strikes. We all hunt each other - problem is you can never know who it is until the weapons are brandished. Assuming you see them do it. Bam! i found my pray and in a busy intersection i find a quiet little spot where nobody is looking. I whip out the ice pick and stab the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to death from behind. Yes! price money is mine. Later i get hungry so i head for the bank automat and pick up some cash. Life is good. i head for the nearby snack machine. There is a bit of a crowd here so surely nobody would try anything? Like a poker player i place my back against the corner and take some potato chips to sate that hunger. As i take my first bite the man standing next to me in the crowd puts away the book he was reading and whips out a shank and stabs me in the ♥♥♥♥ing face while i am enjoying my potato chips. It just happened to be so that i placed myself into a defilade and the crowd was not looking at me at the right moment. I fall down into a pool of blood and my killer scurries behind the corner and starts to walk casually away. I can almost hear him whistle as he does his casual trot on the corridor. A crowd gathers. 'Oh, yet another one bites the dust'. and then they carry on with their own game of cat and mouse. Many more will die tonight. This dear reader is what 10/10 moments are in a game that is revolutionary in idea but unfortunately very much ignored when it was released and thus it is almost abandoned except for the player base. Did i mention even newbies can be good at this game? Practice a bit with bots and then hit for the MP servers.			"

												Moje česká recenze: http://www.playhit.cz/2015/01/ship-opomijeny-deathmatch/The ship is a great experience, especially with friends. It has some of the most hilarious ways how to kill a fellow passanger, like closing them into a freezer or throwing an umbrella at them. It's a better hunting simulator than other actual hunting simulators out there :D. In the beginning of the round, you get a name of your quarry and your future murdurer gets your name. It's only up to you to escape and still kill your victim. All that while managing your human needs. The insecurity and distrust is incredible, if you use teamspeak during the game and it reaches the fun level of Trouble in Terrorist town mod. The ship is great fun but doesn't offer much replayability, only if you really fancy it I guess or have 20 friends who do, because the servers are sadly very empty these days, playing with the AI is decent though 8/10 "

												I've only played the Multiplayer side of it, I haven't try the single player segment, but I'm gonna review this since the multiplayer is a reason to buy this alone. This is one of the most unique deathmatch experience I ever had, at first it might seems like a pointless game, that make their player roleplay, but in the end is one of the most detph deathmatch game, without the high skill entry point. Instead of jus finding weapons and killing everyone that move, the game rewards you for being smart at it, it make you track your target and kill him without witnesses, including the police. Since when they spot you they put you in jail, in which if you're lucky and play your card right you can make your kills there. The game have a wierd sense of humor, I can't explain what is, but is both fun and dark, also the wierd and twisted violence combine with the slow but tense paced of the game, can make some of the most funniest moment in any game I'd ever seen.My only complain about this game I have is, I wish I had played this a lot sooner, there's still people playing this, and there's hardly an empty server, but I just wish had played this on the glory days.

												The Ship you and some other passengers, are enjoying a free cruise out in the middle of the ocean when the person who gave you the free ticket tells you that you the passengers will start hunting each other, at least that's the single player part of it, now if you decide to buy the arcade version only (charging for single player, EA take note) you will spawn as a random created person with a random name (my favorite being Moses Bring) there are rounds, and in between each round you have a set-up period where you can take of your needs, (Like the eating, the pooping, the talking) or getting new weapons, but when the round begins you are given a name of another person on the ship, and their realitive whearabouts, are you are tasked with killing that person without being seen by the ship athourties, however there is a person with your name tasked to kill you, so it adds a lot of suspense to the game, that being said, there is one HUGE flaw in the game, when you want to play online and you go through the game, the game won't be able to find any servers, this however can be fixed by going to view and click on servers then find the ship. so that being said, The Ship is a Very fun game, with countless hours of gameplay, not to mention 1920's era music playing through the ship, so that's always nice			"

This game is only great if you have friends though as AI are kind of easy to deal with.You could get this game when they are having a sale and it's worth it as you get 1 copy of the game and can choose which friends you want to give the extra copies to.

												A fantastic multiplayer experience as The Sims meets Hitman. You have a specifc person to kill every round and must do so without being detected by security.  Your choice of weapon will affect the bounty you get.  Weapons that have been commonly used give less money, so finding a rarer weapon might net you LOADSADOSHHHH.Mix in the mind games on trying to stalk your prey whilst keeping yourself safe.

The Ship - one of the most original games I`ve played.The devious Mr. X (original name right there) hosted a game on a ship that`s miles away from land. Every one is a hunter, and a hunted. The game's a murder mystery one, that hosts quite a lot of original ideas, for example: you're a human being, so you need needs, like entertainment and sleep. Multiplayer is the main focus of the game, as shown by the hour long singleplayer campaign.I recommend the game, but only if you can deal with it's small playerbase.			"

You must avoid holding weapons infront of police, cameras and lots of people. But beware someone might have bribed time to ignore crime so they can kill people even infront of police and cameras.

												***GAME IS NOT DEAD***Amazing murder mystery with cartoony graphics and animations that work very well.The premise goes like this: A mysterious man named Mr. X has gathered all the ship passengers secretly to host his own twisted game of ""manhunt"". Your goal is simple: Kill a target passenger while YOU are ALSO somebody's target. If you successfully manage to kill your quarry, the weapon you used will determine what score you should be granted for that kill. Your hunter will still be looking for you however, and you should do whatever it takes to survive safely.You have 2 options upon joining a match; become a Passenger (a passive Ship passenger) or a Hunter.Hunters have a target passenger they need to kill out of the view of guards, witnesses, and cameras.Passengers serve the same purpose, except they do not have a target to kill. Passengers only need to remain safe for the round.There is also a needs system like The Sims (Eating, going to the toilet, sleeping, boredom)and this prevents players from camping in the safety of rooms with guards, cameras, or staying near witnesses. Witnesses also have a timer in which they can only be a technical witness of a crime for a short time, and will walk by you, traversing the rest of The Ship. Witnesses are also AI controlled, and the other AI in the multiplayer seems to be pretty smart/sneaky sometimes.On top of that, there are certain ""sweet spots"" players that have guns might still be able to use to pick off their prey from a safe distance.TONS of different weapons and some wacky weapons that each grant different money rewards, and money is your score in multiplayer.LOTS OF GAME MODES OTHER THAN THE CLASSIC 'HUNT'. TEST THEM OUT AND HAVE FUN! (I recommend World Leaders mode for playing LAN)Amazingly fun and fresh game, and you can still play The Ship multiplayer alone with bots, so even if people say the game is dead (it really isn't) you can easily crank out 100+ hours playing with bots + the singeplayer story is actually very fun imho.10/10**TO PLAY ONLINE SELECT ""VIEW"" ON THE TOP LEFT OF YOUR STEAM CLIENT, THEN SERVERS, THEN FILTER FOR THE SHIP**			"

It also gives the feeling of suspense and danger as you too are being hunted.A really top game to play with friends and family, and decent people.

												It can be a pain to get the multiplayer set up for this game, but it's absolutely worth it. The multiplayer (which really is the main part of the game, since the singleplayer, while interesting, is basically just a fancy tutorial for the multiplayer and doesn't last more than an hour or two) is pretty dead at the moment, and while you can still find servers to play on if you check the forums for how to find them, you'll generally have to supply your own friends to play with if you want to play with actual humans. There is an HD rerelease launching next year, which will hopefully fix the server issues and revive the playerbase, but for now, if you've got a group of friends and want to kill each other with an assortment of weapons on boats this is a great way to do that without getting in trouble with the law.

												It's a pretty damn good game.Pros: - Source Engine, it's a damn good engine.- Single Player, and Multiplayer.- Fun with friends and fun solo.- Can steal someone's clothes off their corpse.- Good Variety of Weapons.- Good Graphics.Cons:- Sometimes when I'm standing still out of the way of a camera or cop, and it says I'm not being seen, I pull out out a weapon such as a gun and I'm instantly caught even though there was no witness.- Can get tedious if you constantly get arrested because of bs that the game makes up.- Sometimes throwing weapons can be sparratic.- No Master Server Browser. (You have to look up a Server IP on your browser, though that's not very difficult.)Overall? I give this game a 8/10, it's a good game to play despite all the cons.This game gets the Melon seal of approval.			"

												Two things surprised me about this game... Firstly when I played it it was actually populated, more populated than most popular source mods (i.e. Empires) and some of  the more notorious total conversions (Nuclear Dawn). Second, the gameplay was actually fun... Like... Like the kind of fun Team Fortress 2 used to be before they added in all that unnecessary ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.If you don't believe me, this game actually has hats BUILT RIGHT INTO IT. They're already a part of a working game mechanic (create a working disguise to fool your hunter), they aren't superfluous and/or stupid in any way.Although very old now, the art direction doesn't feel very dated. This is largely in part due to how well the source engine has aged. The cartoon-y look and feel also contributes to making the game still look good nearly six years after launch.Downsides are so: Rounds feel incredibly short to do what you need to do and the nigh-$20 price tag. And oh god the character limit is coming up I don't think I'			"

I've spent a couple of hours playing it lately, and I have to say, for a game I got on sale for $5, it gave me a very large amount of bang for my buck.While the in-game server list isn't functional anymore, you can join servers from the Steam server browser. To use it with The Ship, click the ""View"" dropdown menu at the top of the main Steam window. Then, click ""Servers"". Once the browser is open, click ""CHANGE FILTERS"" at the bottom of the window, click the ""Game"" dropdown seleciton menu and scroll down until you find ""The Ship"". Once you're done, click ""REFRESH ALL"" and you're all set!			"

												The Ship is a game sort of like if Hitman had targets, but the targets weren't AI, they are real life people. But here is the catch. You are being hunted as well. With a variety of weapons like crowbard, and revolvers. They even refrence a couple games as well, like Half Life 2 and such. This game was fun when the servers were up. Well, the game still is fun,very fun. People still host servers for The Ship, like the group THE SHIP IS ALIVE. This game is certainly fun with tons of game modes, even if you hate such politicans such as Kim Jong Il, Tony Blair, and even George Bush Jr. This game is very fun, and even more with friends in your own server.9.5/10			"

												I've only played the Multiplayer side of it, I haven't try the single player segment, but I'm gonna review this since the multiplayer is a reason to buy this alone. This is one of the most unique deathmatch experience I ever had, at first it might seems like a pointless game, that make their player roleplay, but in the end is one of the most detph deathmatch game, without the high skill entry point. Instead of jus finding weapons and killing everyone that move, the game rewards you for being smart at it, it make you track your target and kill him without witnesses, including the police. Since when they spot you they put you in jail, in which if you're lucky and play your card right you can make your kills there. The game have a wierd sense of humor, I can't explain what is, but is both fun and dark, also the wierd and twisted violence combine with the slow but tense paced of the game, can make some of the most funniest moment in any game I'd ever seen.My only complain about this game I have is, I wish I had played this a lot sooner, there's still people playing this, and there's hardly an empty server, but I just wish had played this on the glory days.

To have to kill another passenger before they kill you, can really put you on edge.  It's so much fun because you have no idea who is hunting you till it's too late. (Well for the most part) You can also kill who you think is after you.  Anyway I recommend everyone get this game, it's pretty addicting!			"

												One of the most unique concepts for a game I've ever seen.  Clue meets the Sims in this early 1900's cartoon fps.  The only thing that brings this game down is it's buggyness, but when it works, it's a whole lot of fun.  Makes an excellent drinking game as well!  I definately recommend playing this game with friends either in the same room or at least on Skype/whatever online phone program you have.

												Turn Clue into a first-person shooter on 1920's era luxury liners, sprinkle in bits of The Sims, and you've got Outerlight Ltd.'s The Ship. One of the more recent releases on Valve's Steam download service, the game twists around the Clue formula to make it a little more interesting. Instead of having to uncover a killer, The Ship makes you the killer. The main gameplay mechanic revolves around finding your target, called your quarry, and breaking their face as stealthily as possible. To do so there are plenty of lethal odds-and-ends to wield, and even some environmental traps. It's certainly a quirky take on first-person gaming, but it's an entertaining one once you get the hang of it.			"

												The Ship.We have a love-hate relationship.I love this game because of the sense of Paranoia it gives the player, not knowing where your hunter is, and questioning wether or not your target knows you are hunting them.The economic reward mechanics are clever, the least used items being the ones with the highest reward, leading to some crazy if not impractical kills.The only issues I have with this game is the lack of a proper tutorial and a, fundamentally, broken server system. The severs don't appear on the list without going through the Steam server list, and setting up a server is difficult, it's best to play it over LAN with friends.Would I still recomend it? Yes.It's one of the best multiplayer focused games out there, and needs more love.			"

												Okay, let me just say, this game is great, are you the hunter, or the hunted? Well, both, You chase down your quarry, on a boat. Once you mindlessly beat your quarry to death with a pool que, you think everythings okay. Well it turns out the man that followed you into the womans bathroom is your hunter, so your in trouble, you can run to the nearest guard to prevent a pot in the face, or you can of course fight back and perform organ surgery with a umbrella. Some times it is difficult to avoid cameras and guards, so its hard to kill your quarry sometimes, be stealthy, and fallow your quarry, zig in and out of crowds, keep an eye out for your hunter, have a weapon, have a change of clothes to confuse your hunter, bribe the officers, and kill them all HAHAHAHHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously, this game is great!			"

												Honestly, it's a game that appeals to a very certain group.Basically, broken down into catagories: The Good: -Fun game to play with friends, though primarily you need to have more than 4 friends or it gets old real fast on finding out who's who in the murderer/victim fastion. -Most Servers have bots to liven up slow gameplay, so this isn't usually a problem.-Straightforward gameplay with only a few occasional camera/guard glitches in being detected.-The graphics are smooth, and ran on my old toaster. No issues with lag unless map's changing soon.-There's usually a shiv in the prison. Shank time 2k16.-I beat someone to death with a manniquen leg and got like $10,000. The ""Bad"":-The server system is indirect and clunky, relying on server connections through the steam client itself. It was more of a mystery to me to figure out how to get into servers with friends than it was actually finding out that the sketchy looking guy following me down a hallway was trying to pull out an umbrella to bludgeon me with.-The game is nigh impossible to play without at least 3-4 people on the server. Even then it's predictable and repetitive. For max game play experience, be sure to join a game with bots.-Sometimes the controls (i.e. opening closets, doors, etc) can glitch out and leave you stuck a doorframe until someone beats you to death. This is used more than once to block people into a room.-""Autoban"" features on most servers if your money drops too low. This is also inconvenient when you just have a really bad round. Overall, I'd say wait until it's on sale to actually purchase it. I received this as a gift from a friend, who I enjoy playing it with in our group, but standalone or on your own is somewhat unpleasant with the thin presence of other players. Suggested because the game is complete and playable, but be warned that going in this one alone might now be the experience you're expecting, especially since most people will have to google search how to join a server in the first place.

												This game is not given enough credit, partially due to the lack of online multiplayer. LAN multiplayer is, however, surprisingly fun. There are some issues with the bots and certain gameplay modes causing the game to crash, but the main Deathmatch-like mode is fine on most maps.

The traps sound fun in theory but in practice you'll just be shooting or stabbing your prey most of the time. The thrill is in the chase, as the combat is fairly weak, but it's still fun none the less and the sims-like 'needs' system prevents camping. Overall, a quite fun game even though it has its flaws.

												I had no idea I didn't leave a review on this before - but better late than never! I'll just start by saying, in short, that this is genuinely the most unique, fantastic and fun Source game you'll find!This Source remake of the GoldSrc version of The Ship is an incredible one at that - not only was the free, GoldSrc version a unique concept, but this just adds to that in the greatest way possible. Whilst it's now, disappointingly, quite a dead game, it's still incredibly fun with bots and when, if you manage to convince, you pull friends along just to murder them!It's a rather casual game as opposed to TF2 or CS:GO, whilst Source has been known to have a very specific style to train for, The Ship is really easy to learn and gives you the pleasure of enjoying the engine even if you're not good at shooting or fighting in general as this game, obviously, isn't meant for constant fighting!I recommend the hell out of this - it's genuinely one of my top favourite games and has a brilliant structure to it, earning itself high marks simply due to this! Overall the gameplay and the theme it sets is definitely worth your while and can be enjoyed by even the simplest of players!			"

												The ship. A quite unique kind of stealth elimination game, get close to your enemies and then backstab then with a frying pan or a manequin arm.....It is hell of alot of fun, killin people here and there without getting cought by the Police, but if u do have money u can also add the strategy in this game , why?Well bribe the cop and kill everything u see xD .The game is kind of hard to master but after that it is a pleasure for both eyes and mind!Only con is : A small number of servers with enough people to play with.But i used game tracker and i found 2,3 servers which i had loads of fun on! xDLike the time i was takeing a sh** and got killed by Bin Laden ..... Best part : I was Bush .11/10 would get killed by Bin Laden again while takeing a sh**			"

												This game is great for people who like to kill their friends and to just have fun. Usually, games like this get you to kill without taking into account about your needs. This game is perfect because it balances the needs and wants of the character just enough to make it believable. Sure sometimes the needs get annoying but that's part of the game.I also like the overall challenge of the game as a whole. The multiple game modes are great and the maps are awesome. My only concern is that I think there should be a workshop for people who want to make and publish maps. I think this mostly because once you've played all the maps, they get slightly boring.But besides that, great game! I definitely recommend this for people who like action, and spy related stuff. 9/10!			"

												>Be me>Join a server>Come across a fight>Hunter is arrested>Hunter is black man10/10 realism.But seriously, this is a really fun game. The 6 hours I have have all come after I bought the game yesterday. It's that addicting and fun. But here are my pros and cons:Pros:Addicting gameplayGood selection and rotation of mapsServers are very good, not much desyncAmazing conceptGood graphics.The needs system is cool, and you need to balance that and hunting your target.Good character randomization. You don't see the same character twice.Weaponary choice.World leaders modeCons:There's only one or two servers with people, so you're a bit limited, but it doesn't stop you from playing with other people.The graphics look a bit dated, but that just adds to the charm of the game.It's hard to get around in a stairway or tiny little hall, since people's hitboxes are fairly large.Overall I'd say this game is a 9.5/10. Just minor things that won't hinder your experience at all. If you're looking for a cheap, fun game that'll soak up hours, then this game is for you. If you're looking to do world leaders with friends, and want to kill Bush as bin Laden, then this game is for you. If you wanna inject someone with poison, and run away as they slowly die, this game is for you. And, most of all, if you enjoy blowing people across the room with a blunderbuss, and then getting shot yourself with a tommy gun because karma hunter, then this game is for you. "

												This is a very fun multiplayer game set on a ship in the 1920s where you needed to kill your target while avoiding being killed by your own hunter and to have earned the most money by the end of the round by pulling off successful hits. It incorporates authentic music and surrounding to give you a real feeling of being aboard a ship in the time period and you have a vast amount of objects that can be used to kill your quarry that keep the game interesting and fun to play. The main problem a lot of people have is that they can't find a server because the mster server is down, but this issue can be circumnavigated by directly connecting to a server using this site http://www.gameserverdirectory.com/search/the-ship/ .  Just copy one of the ips (I recommend RKSzone as it is the most played)  and go into your favorites tab and find the option ""add server to your favorites by ip"" and paste it there and you should be able to join. Hope to see you aboard.			"

												This game is really fun if you get a server of friends together.  The game is kinda old and buggy.  There is no voice chat in game.  And the master server list is down, so you'll have to connect through the View>Servers feature in Steam.  However, just 1 night of raucous fun with friends will make this a memorable experience of your gaming life.  It's all about deception and murdering your friends.Also, this isn't mentioned in the game, but when you buy it you get a total of 5 copies.  You get 2 gifts, and when the people activate their gifits they get another gift each to give away.  Total of 5 games with 1 purchase.			"

												Multiplayer: it is beautiful, it deserves every award for anything ever. And even if the entire game sucked, the spasms people go through when you chuck something at them would make up for it, or maybe not because you might die from laughter. The only problem is mediocre graphics, but for i personally love them, they make it just cartoony enough. Nice community, only a few servers though. A nice selection of cruises, another problem is navigatio, a minimap would be nice. 11/10, would have bought just the multiplayer for $20Singleplayer: meh, some missions were good, some were not. Good ones in order from best to mediocre: captain murder, Ambassador helper, Bruno's Citizen Slaughter ,prison shankerBad from mediocre to terrible: getting into control room and escape, saving Mrs. Tweed's dog, Doppleganger domination.yes yes i know not all were includedtutorial: not really necessary, the game plays like a regular shooter aside from ""i"" being inventory and middle click holstering weapon.All: do like the rarity of guns and the weapon choice (prison shanks >: ). soundtracks are nice, best menu theme ever.summary: buy nowalso a few hints and tips: claymore is OP (as the AWP) and on the same level as winchester. when out of bullets you can still throw the gun. you can push people overboard on multiplayer. I an 75% sure that empty needles dont do damage so never have only that unless you can inject and get away.Flare guns respawn very fast, a good strategy for the game is fill you inventory with flares and shoot, throw, shoot, throw, etc. until you run out of flares. 1 shot 1 kill for flares. flare strategy is best used for the singleplayer gunbattle. Also another strategy is have half sleeping potions and half flares so you never miss.			"

												Very similar to (although much better than) its cartoony sequel, ""Bloody Good TIme"".The Ship is an old game now, but still plays well and is worth picking up in the sales or a game bundle.  It's a murder party which takes place on a variety of ocean cruise liners, set some time between the wars.  The atmosphere is spot-on.  You're given a target to hunt for and, in turn, you are being hunted by one other (undisclosed) passengers.  You first have to find one of a large variety of weapons to do the deadly deed, then track-down your quarry, fool them into thinking they are not your target and find a safe place to despatch them, but away from the ship's crew and security cameras (in the 1920s ?!) or you'll get caught and put in jail for a while before re-joining the game with all your posessions gone (but there's a hidden shank in the prison!).  You have to do all this while balancing your normal bodily needs of eating, bathing, going to the toilet, reading, interacting with other people etc. and avoiding getting murdered yourself!  Great concept and it works very well, if you can find a populated server, which is the main challange!Very Important: the in-game browser does not work any more to find internet games (which you will want to do - don't bother with the single-player game).  Instead, go the the main menu of Steam, ""View"", then ""Servers"" and filter the search results for ""The Ship"" (you'll also want to tick ""has users playing"" in the browser).  There are still people playing if you look at the right time (e.g. peak hours or weekends).The same trick also works for findings online games with the sequel,  BGT.			"

												The story (more or less):The Ship puts you in an interesting scenario; You and several other cheapskates have been lured onto a luxary cruise liner, the bait being that it was free. The downside becomes apparent when your benefactor, Mr. X, announces that you are now all captive and part of his ship-board entertainment, which is basically a huge game of cat and mouse whilst looking after your characters basic needs, sims-style. Each person is given a target to murder, but also has someone after them as well. There is a plethora of various items scattered around the ship that can be used to kill your quarry, some giving higher cash prizes for a kill than others, depending on Mr. X's mood... but beware, for you are being hunted as well.Gameplay:Story mode is linear and....er... that's about all I picked up. We're all here for the multiplayer after all! (Moving on)Multiplayer:The multiplayer is fun, especially with friends or people you know. Finding a server within the game is next to impossible... due to them being shut down, but search via steam and you get a good few active ones at any time. The organic feel of roaming around, trying to find your quarry whilst simultaniously trying to avoid every other person in case they want to whop you over the head with an umbrella or frying pan is very fun. You collect money from killing your quarry, dropped wallets/purses and killing your hunter before they kill you. You can, however, loose it quite fast as well. Carry too much cash around and someone can kill you and steal a large portion of it. Get caught with a weapon out or in a restricted area and you can be fined and jailed for a set time. (Get caught with half an armory in your coat and your money will vanish in an instant). So you need to keep moving and save all your money in the bank right? Wrong. You can do that, but you need to buy food, drink, new clothes to disguise yourself and bribe guards to look the other way for a bit to gain the advantage.This game is great, organic, sneaky, hilarious, stalking fun. Murder someone on the toilet or while they take a nap, trap someone in a room and wait until they starve to death while you eat crisps on the other side of the door. It's an old game with it's fair share of small problems, but for the (at least) 3 copies you get for the price, it is awesome!			"

												I feel like The Ship is a diamond in the rough. It is definitely some of the most fun I've had playing online.This game may be old, but it's gameplay modes are so simple yet so fun to play. The mechanics used in The Ship perfectly highlight the entertaining chaos that happens during the hectic rounds.The maps are ingeniously crafted with care at every corner, plus the graphics are cartoony meaning it still looks fantastic even after 8 years of time since its release.Honestly, I wish more people played this game. It's a shame that its main server went down, but many servers are still filled with enthusiastic players to provide an enjoyable, fun experience.When you buy The Ship, two free copies are given to you to give to your friends. If that doesn't sell it to you, I don't know what will.You should play this game.			"

												If there ever was a Cluedo game where you picked your murder weapon, your persona and a murder location. It would be Kill Doctor Lucky. But if it had to be a video game, The Ship: Murder Party would be down right on the money. Where do you even begin with this game? You are a passenger on a ship, with a little Assassin's Creed mark in your lower right corner, and a Ship to scour for weapons, enviromental kills and other fun things you can do to your friends in this multiplayer experience.And while it might not seem at all proper to pipe someone's head in with this neatly convinient pipewrench you found in the highly restricted engine room, there are at least one other person out and about trying to do the same to you. All in an attempt to satisfy a masked figure who won't let you off the boat until you scored a high amount of money. How to get money? Well murder in creative ways, use non-traditional weapons. Nobody loves a serial killer with trademarks on this boat though, so out you go to find more weapons. Perhaps that big pot you saw down in the kitchen could bear down on this elderly woman's neck when she looks over to get the waiter's attention?All is tongue-in-cheek crazy and the visual tone of the game gives it the 'innocence' it deserves. And there is nothing better walking past an enemy you thought was a bystander to hear an unmistaken click of a revolver. Great game, preferably play it with friends if you can get away with it, the 4 player pack is worth every cent/penny and allows for massive entertainment. The Ship: Murder Party definately delivers.			"

												I can easily understand what the makers of this game we're trying to go for, it's pretty much the first ever version of trouble in terrorist town (from gmod) and it works well. You can pay for the single player and multiplayer separately and it's a good thing you can. Why? Because the single player is extremely dull because most of the missions are all the same. Somebody will give you some fetch quest like task, and there is always a guy in the way that you have to kill, then you have to backtrack to the person you got the mission from in (through a very confusing layout) order to get money. This is one of the most repetative games I've ever played and it doesn't help that your sprint is slow and takes forever to re-charge. Honestly that's all I can say about the single-player. Multiplayer is way better, while its server service/search is completely broken and you have to go online to find a server IP to get into one, I guarantee once you're past that point it's a blast with you trying to find your quarry and killing them before time runs out, but if you can make a server with your friends, you'll without a doubt you have an even better time. Multiplayer is worth the 20 dollars its asking for. However I think you should look up some videos online about The Ship before you buy anything. I give the ship(both single player and multiplayer together) a: 7/10			"

												First of all, I've played this for at least 100 hours on an older and different account. I saw it cheap during the summersale, so I decided to pick it up incase someone else would.The Ship is a game about killing, or to be killed. The array of weapons is enourmus, not to speak of hidden ways to kill (Locking them into a freezer!). The map designed is amazing, there's secret passages and stashes you can use to fool less knowing players and while some might seem a bit small - the majority are unique and good in their own way. The game has a very special early 1900's theme to it, with fitting music playing in the background and visuals to go along with it. That said, neither the audio or art design is state of the art. (It is pretty old by now.) However, it all goes together in a sort of cartoony' but bloody murder party.As for the game, it is divided up into three different downloads. Previously The Ship and The Ship Singleplayer have been separate, but now they're two in one. The Ship is the main multiplayer game where the most fun is to be had. The Ship Singleplayer is as it sounds the games singleplayer campaign. The whole story is rather weak however, but it's great to play for variation and to learn the game. (Which I honestly think they had in mind.) The Ship Tutorial is as it sounds - a tutorial.A.t.m. I am playing this relatively alone. There's in general filled servers you can join (Use the steam server browser, the one IG is broken!) and the community, although small is in general mature and friendly. That said, in order to get the most out of the game you should play it as a Co-Op title with a voice chat program like Skype, mumble, etc.For its price, especially during sales when it goes as far as 80% off; it's totally worth. Even just playing on public servers alone or with a friend.Great game, can't wait for the HD remake next year.Edit:There seems to be SOME instabilities this time around. Most likely this is because of the aging source engine, however it's been nothing major. Crashing just before smashing someones head in with an umbrella is frustrating, but it's definitely still worth the price. I have not myself had problems at all running the game, rather it's run smoothly after turning off VSync and limiting the framerate. It's up to each individual to decide how major this is, but IMO it's still a great game.			"

												Very nice game!Gameplay is intuituve and very fun.  Setting someone on fire with a flare gun is a very satisfying experience, and game is very tense at times especially when facing off against a victim with a weapon.Artistic style is also very engaging and it is refreshing to see something different in an online game.However game seems to be showing its age, and hasnt been updated in a long time.  Combined with the developer not updating server connections anymore it can be frustrating at the start.Overall Reccomend			"

												Very similar to (although much better than) its cartoony sequel, ""Bloody Good TIme"".The Ship is an old game now, but still plays well and is worth picking up in the sales or a game bundle.  It's a murder party which takes place on a variety of ocean cruise liners, set some time between the wars.  The atmosphere is spot-on.  You're given a target to hunt for and, in turn, you are being hunted by one other (undisclosed) passengers.  You first have to find one of a large variety of weapons to do the deadly deed, then track-down your quarry, fool them into thinking they are not your target and find a safe place to despatch them, but away from the ship's crew and security cameras (in the 1920s ?!) or you'll get caught and put in jail for a while before re-joining the game with all your posessions gone (but there's a hidden shank in the prison!).  You have to do all this while balancing your normal bodily needs of eating, bathing, going to the toilet, reading, interacting with other people etc. and avoiding getting murdered yourself!  Great concept and it works very well, if you can find a populated server, which is the main challange!Very Important: the in-game browser does not work any more to find internet games (which you will want to do - don't bother with the single-player game).  Instead, go the the main menu of Steam, ""View"", then ""Servers"" and filter the search results for ""The Ship"" (you'll also want to tick ""has users playing"" in the browser).  There are still people playing if you look at the right time (e.g. peak hours or weekends).The same trick also works for findings online games with the sequel,  BGT.			"

												One of my favs your goal is to gain either the money goal in the server or to have the most money in the server you do so bye murderering your quarry stated at the bottom right of the screen killing your target gets you money but killing those that are not your quarry will result in money loss the money you get is dependent on the money the object used is worth calculated by the last time it was used so for example you kill someone with a blunderbuss the next time you kill someone instead of getting lets say $2000 you get $100 but if you leave something alone for a long time you will see that the money from $2000 will be something higher like $8000 if you buy it youll probably ask WHERE ARE THE SERVERS which you actually have to go to steam client - view - servers - the ship and in short GET THIS GAME			"

												I feel like The Ship is a diamond in the rough. It is definitely some of the most fun I've had playing online.This game may be old, but it's gameplay modes are so simple yet so fun to play. The mechanics used in The Ship perfectly highlight the entertaining chaos that happens during the hectic rounds.The maps are ingeniously crafted with care at every corner, plus the graphics are cartoony meaning it still looks fantastic even after 8 years of time since its release.Honestly, I wish more people played this game. It's a shame that its main server went down, but many servers are still filled with enthusiastic players to provide an enjoyable, fun experience.When you buy The Ship, two free copies are given to you to give to your friends. If that doesn't sell it to you, I don't know what will.You should play this game.			"

												The story (more or less):The Ship puts you in an interesting scenario; You and several other cheapskates have been lured onto a luxary cruise liner, the bait being that it was free. The downside becomes apparent when your benefactor, Mr. X, announces that you are now all captive and part of his ship-board entertainment, which is basically a huge game of cat and mouse whilst looking after your characters basic needs, sims-style. Each person is given a target to murder, but also has someone after them as well. There is a plethora of various items scattered around the ship that can be used to kill your quarry, some giving higher cash prizes for a kill than others, depending on Mr. X's mood... but beware, for you are being hunted as well.Gameplay:Story mode is linear and....er... that's about all I picked up. We're all here for the multiplayer after all! (Moving on)Multiplayer:The multiplayer is fun, especially with friends or people you know. Finding a server within the game is next to impossible... due to them being shut down, but search via steam and you get a good few active ones at any time. The organic feel of roaming around, trying to find your quarry whilst simultaniously trying to avoid every other person in case they want to whop you over the head with an umbrella or frying pan is very fun. You collect money from killing your quarry, dropped wallets/purses and killing your hunter before they kill you. You can, however, loose it quite fast as well. Carry too much cash around and someone can kill you and steal a large portion of it. Get caught with a weapon out or in a restricted area and you can be fined and jailed for a set time. (Get caught with half an armory in your coat and your money will vanish in an instant). So you need to keep moving and save all your money in the bank right? Wrong. You can do that, but you need to buy food, drink, new clothes to disguise yourself and bribe guards to look the other way for a bit to gain the advantage.This game is great, organic, sneaky, hilarious, stalking fun. Murder someone on the toilet or while they take a nap, trap someone in a room and wait until they starve to death while you eat crisps on the other side of the door. It's an old game with it's fair share of small problems, but for the (at least) 3 copies you get for the price, it is awesome!			"

												Though the game's graphics may be outdated today, I honestly think you should still get this game, it's a boat load of fun and the very unique gameplay will make you keep coming back even to just play with some bots. Since this game is rather old now, it comes with 2 Steam gifts of the Ship bundle (Single player and The Ship), so if you and a group of friends wanted to play together, a couple of you buy it and gift the rest of them and one of them could host a server. The single player is also fun. It's not amazing, it's rather tedious, actually. But, despite that it's still a lot of fun,  and I think you shouldn't overlook it.Anyways, I think the ship is worth getting and it's a whole lot of fun. I'd definently suggest to anyone.			"

												Like a classic murder mystery novel or game of cluedo. With purse bombs. And umbrellas. Balance your hunger, thirst, need to pee, social needs and literacy with the demanding life of an assassin. In a game of hunter hunting the hunter 'The Ship' requires players to keep a balanced lifestyle whilst attempting to bloodily beat up their quarry using the weapon which gives the most payout. Sometimes it'll be a katana, sometimes it'll be a rolling pin. When a player has taken out their target, each other player has 90 seconds to kill their targets to earn the bounty. After a number of rounds the player with the most lucrative assassinations wins. Connect via steam servers and this game will surely be a 'hit' among friends.			"

												A murder simulator in the truest sense (eat your heart out GTA), this game is about carefully and deliberately planning the deaths of your fellow passengers without getting caught while always being hunted by another human with the goal of collecting the bounty on your head.  Is there ANYTHING better than that?  No.  The answer you were looking for is ""No"".			"

												Of the hundreds of games that I have played on Steam, this is probably one of my absolute favorites. The single-player is alright but really not that great, but the multiplayer is an entirely different story. This game is one of those few games that will really get you riled up. Even for such a simple game, it's extremely exhilarating, and you can't stop playing. If you can get over the old-fashioned graphics (which frankly make the game more exciting), then you will absolutely LOVE this game. Play it! Play it now!			"

The in game $ is kinda cool but I was disapointed where you can't purchase weapons in a store, needs to be more purposes for $ in game. Multiple ways to kill your target, & the ai feature was a nice bonus to the game. Also, the main issue that I disliked the most is that I can't find any public servers without looking for a servers ip, there needs to be an easier way.

												If there ever was a Cluedo game where you picked your murder weapon, your persona and a murder location. It would be Kill Doctor Lucky. But if it had to be a video game, The Ship: Murder Party would be down right on the money. Where do you even begin with this game? You are a passenger on a ship, with a little Assassin's Creed mark in your lower right corner, and a Ship to scour for weapons, enviromental kills and other fun things you can do to your friends in this multiplayer experience.And while it might not seem at all proper to pipe someone's head in with this neatly convinient pipewrench you found in the highly restricted engine room, there are at least one other person out and about trying to do the same to you. All in an attempt to satisfy a masked figure who won't let you off the boat until you scored a high amount of money. How to get money? Well murder in creative ways, use non-traditional weapons. Nobody loves a serial killer with trademarks on this boat though, so out you go to find more weapons. Perhaps that big pot you saw down in the kitchen could bear down on this elderly woman's neck when she looks over to get the waiter's attention?All is tongue-in-cheek crazy and the visual tone of the game gives it the 'innocence' it deserves. And there is nothing better walking past an enemy you thought was a bystander to hear an unmistaken click of a revolver. Great game, preferably play it with friends if you can get away with it, the 4 player pack is worth every cent/penny and allows for massive entertainment. The Ship: Murder Party definately delivers.			"

												Very similar to (although much better than) its cartoony sequel, ""Bloody Good TIme"".The Ship is an old game now, but still plays well and is worth picking up in the sales or a game bundle.  It's a murder party which takes place on a variety of ocean cruise liners, set some time between the wars.  The atmosphere is spot-on.  You're given a target to hunt for and, in turn, you are being hunted by one other (undisclosed) passengers.  You first have to find one of a large variety of weapons to do the deadly deed, then track-down your quarry, fool them into thinking they are not your target and find a safe place to despatch them, but away from the ship's crew and security cameras (in the 1920s ?!) or you'll get caught and put in jail for a while before re-joining the game with all your posessions gone (but there's a hidden shank in the prison!).  You have to do all this while balancing your normal bodily needs of eating, bathing, going to the toilet, reading, interacting with other people etc. and avoiding getting murdered yourself!  Great concept and it works very well, if you can find a populated server, which is the main challange!Very Important: the in-game browser does not work any more to find internet games (which you will want to do - don't bother with the single-player game).  Instead, go the the main menu of Steam, ""View"", then ""Servers"" and filter the search results for ""The Ship"" (you'll also want to tick ""has users playing"" in the browser).  There are still people playing if you look at the right time (e.g. peak hours or weekends).The same trick also works for findings online games with the sequel,  BGT.			"

												Though the game's graphics may be outdated today, I honestly think you should still get this game, it's a boat load of fun and the very unique gameplay will make you keep coming back even to just play with some bots. Since this game is rather old now, it comes with 2 Steam gifts of the Ship bundle (Single player and The Ship), so if you and a group of friends wanted to play together, a couple of you buy it and gift the rest of them and one of them could host a server. The single player is also fun. It's not amazing, it's rather tedious, actually. But, despite that it's still a lot of fun,  and I think you shouldn't overlook it.Anyways, I think the ship is worth getting and it's a whole lot of fun. I'd definently suggest to anyone.			"

												Multiplayer: it is beautiful, it deserves every award for anything ever. And even if the entire game sucked, the spasms people go through when you chuck something at them would make up for it, or maybe not because you might die from laughter. The only problem is mediocre graphics, but for i personally love them, they make it just cartoony enough. Nice community, only a few servers though. A nice selection of cruises, another problem is navigatio, a minimap would be nice. 11/10, would have bought just the multiplayer for $20Singleplayer: meh, some missions were good, some were not. Good ones in order from best to mediocre: captain murder, Ambassador helper, Bruno's Citizen Slaughter ,prison shankerBad from mediocre to terrible: getting into control room and escape, saving Mrs. Tweed's dog, Doppleganger domination.yes yes i know not all were includedtutorial: not really necessary, the game plays like a regular shooter aside from ""i"" being inventory and middle click holstering weapon.All: do like the rarity of guns and the weapon choice (prison shanks >: ). soundtracks are nice, best menu theme ever.summary: buy nowalso a few hints and tips: claymore is OP (as the AWP) and on the same level as winchester. when out of bullets you can still throw the gun. you can push people overboard on multiplayer. I an 75% sure that empty needles dont do damage so never have only that unless you can inject and get away.Flare guns respawn very fast, a good strategy for the game is fill you inventory with flares and shoot, throw, shoot, throw, etc. until you run out of flares. 1 shot 1 kill for flares. flare strategy is best used for the singleplayer gunbattle. Also another strategy is have half sleeping potions and half flares so you never miss.			"

												Fantastic game, Only gripe is that you have to look up how to join games given that the in-game master server went down long ago and there is no official answer that I could find. (You go to view-> Servers in Steam and find a server that way) Once in however, prepare for paranoia, addiction, and some of the most comical murders ever (wanna smack somebody overboard with a manaquin arm?) Done.			"

												I beat a guy with a pool stick, shot another with a machine gun. I was murdered with a syringe while taking a dump on the toilet.  Definitely an interesting and fun game. It takes brains  and luck to win.  The game is kinda like of a murder mystery and sims mixed. Hunt or be hunted. Kill or be killed.  I do recommend this.   Just wished more people played!			"

												The best Multiplayer game I've played recently. Me and a bunch of my friends had a ton of fun running around trying to kill eachother in creative ways. One of my favorite moments was waiting outside the room and blowing away one of them with a machine gun. So many creative weapons and hilarious scenarios that can be acted out. If your looking for some crazy, silly and just ridicoulus fun then definitely get this game!			"

												3.9/5Overall the gameplay is very intresting & fun with a group of people or friends. Multiple gamemodes but there needs to be more types in my opinion. The in game $ is kinda cool but I was disapointed where you can't purchase weapons in a store, needs to be more purposes for $ in game. Multiple ways to kill your target, & the ai feature was a nice bonus to the game. Also, the main issue that I disliked the most is that I can't find any public servers without looking for a servers ip, there needs to be an easier way. Overall its worth purchasing & playing with a group of people, I guarantee you will have fun.			"

												I really Do love the ship I mean the mix up with the sims and hitman it provides a sense of paranoia that when your character sleeps poops, baths,eating that some is just wating for the time. I do really like this game however i did not like the fact they seperated the single player from the multiplayer I just feel that it is cheap. Also now it is hard to make a server but still really you need to play it. My friend has a really crappy laptop and it gives him 50fps on lowest so you can run it on the crappiest thing in the universe.Overall I Like this game I do have some issues as of its age now but it is still great 8.5/10			"

												This BARELY got a recommendation, it can be a really great game, but at times it can just suck.The game has three parts, all of which are seperate games in your Steam library:The Ship (the multiplayer mode)The Ship - SingleplayerThe Ship - TutorialI'll start with the latter two.The tutorial goes thru the very basic parts of the game such as item handling, and a lot of the important gameplay stuff is explained by the tutor but never demonstrated. It's a very bare bones tutorial that doesn't really justify being seperate from the main game.The Singleplayer feels a bit like a continuation of the tutorial, it's got a tiny bit of story and hardly anything else to it, just a bunch of ""go from point A to point B and do X"" style objectives. Oh, and I never actually ended up completing it because of a game breaking bug.Overall the singleplayer modes are weak and not really worth installing when you can just find a guide or a video on how to play.The Ship (the multiplayer mode) is a game where you are assigned a quarry, you must kill your quarry in the 90 second time limit. The sillier the weapon you use, the more points you earn from the kill. But be wary, because someone else is hunting you too! Also watch out for the security as if they see you with a weapon you will be arrested.The gameplay can be great fun, it feels very rewarding when you finally hunt down and kill your quarry.The game is not without its issues however, and it has a lot.So far the greatest issue is that the community is pretty much dead, playing on servers might as well just be the same thing as playing a local bot game. (which is nowhere near as fun as with real people)If you can find a way to play with friends then you can have some fun with them, if you manage to get everyone a copy.I realise this is an old game, but it lacks SteamPipe features such as being to setup a lobby in game and have it Just Work without screwing around with server settings and port fowarding.If you manage to port foward then you can host a listen server from the game itself for your friends, you just need to make sure you sv_lan 0 because the server will think it is lan only.With all of that out of the way, time to address the gameplay issues themselves.In this game you have two main classes of weapons, melee and firearms. The melee weapons prove to be hard to kill anyone with as security will arrest you as soon as you pull out a weapon. There's no regenerating health, health can only be regained by eating, which makes melee fights pretty much a case of either who hits first or who has the most health.The firearms are very powerful, but are also hard to come by, you will find yourself looking around trying to find a decent gun as the melee weapons are like pencils in comparison. They have lots of advantages, such as high damage, high fire rate, ability to shoot people who are inside a secured area by standing outside the guard's view, and range in general.Because of this the game tends to have a degree of luck instead of skill, as there are no ramifications for using a firearm like there are Melee weapons.The maps are too small for servers of 32 player, but are also too large for 2-6 players. Even so the time limit is way too short to deal with everything else and trying to find your quarry, which brings me to another part.The needs system. It's meant to add a challenge but ends up just being tedious, there are so many ""needs"" that must be kept satisfied otherwise consequences will occur, ranging from an animation of you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your pants or gaining an army of flies, to dying on the spot.The security guards end up just being a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ as they are everywhere and always in the worst places, there needs to be a time limit for how long you can hold a melee weapon for until the guard notices (which will be interrupted by attempting to swing the weapon of course), as he just notices instantly and you get thrown in prison.Prison is also know to be abused by people after they've killed someone to avoid being killed by their hunter.Overall it's a fun game to play with the right people, people who don't play seriously and just kill everyone completely ruin the game. If you can find a good bunch of people who are able to play seriously enough to not be a nuicance then I can safely recommend this game as it can be loads of fun (even with its flaws), if you're just looking for some multiplayer games to play then move along, this game's public multiplayer is dead.

												Ahhh... Being out on the open ocean, nothing around you for miles. It's the perfect time to just... Murder everyone!This game is tons of fun to play with friends, especially when you don't tell them who you are, and where you are. It can either be quick and fast paced, or slower and much more strategic. Either way, if you have a raging blood lust, and love cruise ships. This is definately a great game to play. Just make sure to have a few friends, but don't fret since this game comes with 6 full games if you just buy one.			"

The melee weapons prove to be hard to kill anyone with as security will arrest you as soon as you pull out a weapon. There's no regenerating health, health can only be regained by eating, which makes melee fights pretty much a case of either who hits first or who has the most health.The firearms are very powerful, but are also hard to come by, you will find yourself looking around trying to find a decent gun as the melee weapons are like pencils in comparison. They have lots of advantages, such as high damage, high fire rate, ability to shoot people who are inside a secured area by standing outside the guard's view, and range in general.Because of this the game tends to have a degree of luck instead of skill, as there are no ramifications for using a firearm like there are Melee weapons.The maps are too small for servers of 32 player, but are also too large for 2-6 players. Even so the time limit is way too short to deal with everything else and trying to find your quarry, which brings me to another part.The needs system. It's meant to add a challenge but ends up just being tedious, there are so many ""needs"" that must be kept satisfied otherwise consequences will occur, ranging from an animation of you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ your pants or gaining an army of flies, to dying on the spot.The security guards end up just being a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ as they are everywhere and always in the worst places, there needs to be a time limit for how long you can hold a melee weapon for until the guard notices (which will be interrupted by attempting to swing the weapon of course), as he just notices instantly and you get thrown in prison.Prison is also know to be abused by people after they've killed someone to avoid being killed by their hunter.Overall it's a fun game to play with the right people, people who don't play seriously and just kill everyone completely ruin the game. If you can find a good bunch of people who are able to play seriously enough to not be a nuicance then I can safely recommend this game as it can be loads of fun (even with its flaws), if you're just looking for some multiplayer games to play then move along, this game's public multiplayer is dead.

												Kill your target without detecting by guards, cameras and witnessed by civillians. That seems simple but the game itself really full of fun. Also there is a singleplayer campaign and bot-match option except multiplayer.But there is a problem about multiplayer: when you try to join a server, it pops out a message that says ""Error verifying STEAM UserID ticket."" I tried many things but i couldn't get over it. Other multiplayer Source-powered games i have runs well.Last thing: i don't know that still in effect while you reading this, but when you buy one, you get one spare copy. Share with your friends or open a giveaway on some site.edit: As i see, servers are shut down. Sad, i never be able to play it online.			"

												This game is great.It's one-of-a-kind with its play style that combines suspense and tactics with a first person shooter. Well, I say 'shooter' - you'll probably spend more time rooting through cabinets and suitcases or clubbing people in the face than you will actually shooting.If you've got this far, you'll probably understand the basic idea of the game; you have to hunt someone whilst being hunted. But it's not just that. You also have to stay out of jail, keep on top of money and look after yourself by going to the toilet, having a bite to eat or taking a nap every now and then, and all of this takes place in a maze of similar-looking corridoors filled with falling lifeboats and lunatics who want to kill you with a letter opener. If it weren't for the viewable map, the game would simply be filled with passengers constantly dying of thirt whilst searching for a bar at which you can buy some life-saving beer. And all of this is outside the main purpose, which is to stay on top of the leaderboard. To do that, you've got to search for a weapon that'll give you a good amount of money for your kill, before hunting down and slaughtering your quarry within the time limit - whichever deck they happen to be on. Whilst all of that's happening, you're trying to work out which of the random people you bump into is going to brutally murder you, which will undoubtedly lead to you carefully backing away from, or pulling a gun on, any person who looks remotely suspicious, despite their totally innocent intentions (murdering somebody who isn't you).tl;drI impaled a man with a set of knitting needles because he looked at my funny, and you will, too.9/10 (one point lost because of issues finding servers)			"

												""The Ship"" is a thrilling mystery murder game. Passengers are on a boat, and paid assassins but use what they can find around them to eliminate their target. If desperate, even a mannequin arm can be used to take out the assassin's target. Players can play as a hunter or a passenger. As a passenger, you can aid in security by performing a citizen's arrest on those you find to be suspicious. All in all, this is a fantastic game of wit and skill, similar to source mod, trouble in terrorist town.			"

												Getting a server hosted for this can be an issue at first, but if you manage to figure it out, you have access to a hidden gem. A rather odd but nifty combo of covertly detouring your target somewhere away from the prying eyes of security and fellow members of the cruise, keeping a keen eye on what items will grant you the most valuable kills, and all the while making sure to keep your money safe and your personal needs satisfied. Imagine elements of The Sims thrown into Assassin's Creed: Revelations multiplayer... on a cruise. Odd thought.Get a big group of friends together for the inevitable arguments, screams over wallet bombs, and hasty searching through prison bedside drawers for the one shank available. You can even decide to play with World Leaders. Who would win in a fight: Margaret Thatcher with a frying pan, or Ronald Reagan with a croquet mallet?

												Now this is interesting. For all intents and purposes, this is a first-person interpretation of Steve Jackson's ""Killer"" live action game, but set in a tighter environment and with more weapon variety. With that in mind it even has shades of the excellent pre-murder-mystery game ""Kill Doctor Lucky"".Now, you might think that a game that, intentionally or not, reflects these other sources may be a bit derivative, but it really isn't. Indeed it is a particularly refreshing thing to be playing, not quite as frenetic as the FPS games out there, but lacking the long-term sense of digging in that the survival games have. It really does sit nicely in its niche and seems likely to occupy those periods where I need a quick blast of multi-player gaming that requires the use of my rarely deployed sense of deviousness.Graphically it isn't amazing, but it is still certainly appealing and a good job is done setting the different shipboard environments. more than anything though, this game is probably going to generate a lot of anecdotal moments and that is increasingly rare these days.Sure, the graphics aren't top notch, the sound is atmospheric but not rich and the environments are not sprawling (and this is a good thing), but what we have is a great little self-contained game that deserves ongoing attention. Well worth the price of admission.			"

												Have you ever experienced the burning desire to whack someone over the head with a large fire axe, while they are occupying the lavatory, purely for the sadistic purpose of entertaining a creepy man in a mask which appears to be stolen from an early sci-fi B-list movie?No?Oh. Well... I guess this isn't the game for you.Perhaps you're more of a Viva Piñata person... That, or a vertically-challenged carrot with the hiccups.			"

												I remember waiting to get this game, it released a day before my birthday 10 years ago (in 5 days is the 10 year anniversary...jeezomg). I cannot extol a game as highly as this one.  It is a guilty pleasure, it’s very tense for those actually vying to win the match; nothing comes close to explaining the thrill of tracking and finding your quarry…and murdering them in an unsuspecting manner..Each round you are given a name of a person you must assassinate using random weapons you find (which have different $ rewards), all while keeping an eye open for a person who is doing the same: hunting you.  The maps are deep and intricate, they really put effort and care into this game.  There are secret passages to sneak and escape, you can bribe officers to turn a blind eye, and you can steam people to death, explosives, firearms...I mean come on its awesome.There are also other types of gameplay like Teams and Deathmatch; there’s also a seasonal Christmas version of maps too.As aforementioned by others, a big beef is the lack of players, but when you get a good server its truly an amazing treat, sometimes you gotta wait for other parts of the world to log on (RUS & AUS I’m talking to you, get more players!).  Thank you Outerlight for this game and Steam or whomever is keeping it here running, legit there have been many a time I think about the sad day when they shut this game down due to time, players, costs, etc. and I would be so devastated.  Help keep this gem alive, it’s a classic. 10/10 A+++			"

												This is a highly entertaining game. I had never heard of it til I saw it on the Nov 14 Steam sale. It was cheap and sounded good.  My friends and I love playing (LAN multi only, online is no longer supported).  Basically everyone is an assassin and each person tries to kill their target without getting busted by the fuzz.  Controls are dead simple. It's even better when you don't know which character your opponents are controlling. I think it is a shame that the complete pack no longer has the gift copies (due to lack of gifting). Luckily (for my friends) the bonus was still in effect when I bought mine (amazing deal really when you consider it had 4 EXTRA copies)! And none are being wasted! Only wish we had heard of it sooner (maybe we could have kept online going),			"

												Yes and no. Yes if you don't mind playing over LAN (which is, thankfully, not an ordeal to make work) but no if you expect to play this online. It doesn't work online, none of the fixes that have been offered work any longer (Direct IP connection, Steam Server List, Console Commands) if they ever did to begin with, although there are some public servers put up by a blessed few that seem to work don't expect to be customizing your private game. Further, the publisher stated they were unwilling to purchase the development rights to the game, meaning there will be no patch.The game itself is exactly how it advertises itself, it's a game of discreet MURDER put on by a Victorian era madman, this doesn't go as far as Clue levels of mystery which is a bit of a shame but it is a fun Cat and Mouse game... of MURDER. The enviornments are lovingly crafted, the game engine is functional with its wacky bits only complementing the wacky nature of the game, and the game balance allows for both a back and forth AND instant death.Camping isn't much of a problem in the game, not only due to the need to kill your target but also because your character will need to read books and piddle from time to time or they will die, like a chihuahua. Killing everyone you meet isn't so smart, either, likely because you will be seen with so much murdering, and because you quickly lose the game due to point loss. With these two issues countered there shouldn't be much to worry you about game balance.			"

If you recieve it as a gift, you also get a free copy to gift)Points of Interest-Comedic and silly gameplay, and a great casual or competitive game-People may say the online community is dead, because the in-game server browser is broken and they don't know better. To actually connect to an online game: Open the steam client and go to View > Servers > The Ship-The Single Player mode is not nearly as fun, but can be interesting.			"

												This game is just brilliant to play with a group of friends! Sure, the servers are lacking players but I find it more suspenseful when there are fewer players fighting on a massive ship. Basically, this game is like the sims (In that you need to keep your character sociable, well fed & hygienic) mixed with the ability to beat the hell out of other people with canes, umbrellas etc. The ability to throw a weapon is also such a laugh, you can run away from your pursuer sure, but more often than not that just means that they're going to throw a fire axe straight into the back of your head. The good: - Can wear kilts- Can find tommy guns in bedroom drawers (Easy there Michael Corleone) - Can get brutally murdered in the shower/ in your sleep/ while urinating!- There are many different ship maps to play on. (Each map is quite unique) - Range of weapons ranging from a simple umbrella to a winchester rifle :O- The element of suspense (Sure, it's a cartoony game, but when people are chasing you, oh god...)- Requires some form of strategy - The need to find your target & then take them out without any witnesses.- There is a lot of interaction within the game (As stated before, it is like the sims in some ways) - Range of game modes - Elimination, Deathmatch (Just a few examples) & the team varieties. - Well worth the money (Just a decent pick up and play game for the casual gamer)The bad:- Sometimes when the game indicates that there are no nearby witnesses, you get arrested out of the blue. - Going to prison within the game can be a traumatic experience (Don't drop the soap!) - Doesn't seem to be a mode in which you can just kill everyone freely at your leisure (Not good for those who are insane and itching to commit mass murder)The ugly: - The graphics (Don't worry, they don't ruin the fun or the tension of the game) So as you can tell, the game is pretty good. Sure, it isn't amazing, but it isn't to be expected from such a low budget game. However, there can be a lot of funny moments within the game when playing with friends especially. For example, a friend of mine was like 'You come in this room and i'll kill you' to which I merely shot him through the window with my tommy gun. Like I actually needed to go into the room... ;) If you're looking for a game to pick up and play whenever you feel like chasing people with an axe like a rapid lumberjack, this is the game for you!

												The Ship is a game where you have to kill someone and someone else has to kill you. Different weapons grant different amounts of money and If you're seen you go to jail. You must also take care of basic needs (food, drink, toilet, cleanliness, social, etc.) With the summer sale currently on, I suggest this game for the big discount as it would still be worth it for the full price. The single-player story is good, but the multiplayer is awesome and since there is a sale, the servers will be more filled than usual. Time to get money off noobs!			"
