 I bought this game long ago, when it first released, to the people that complain and give it bad reviews, all i have to say, is, its your fault you bought it now, because what this game was, is no longer, you should have done your research before hand.I bought this game when on its release like i said (The play time hours you see are not represenative of what i actually played, since at that time such hour stat system did not exist) and in its glory days, was an amazing game, i had endless hours of fun with this, from sniping (the way sniping is meant to be done in large maps) to close quarter, vehicles, you name it. This game was ahead of its time, and its true worth was on the multiplayer, and so i cannot recommend you buy this at the current time, since the multiplayer is long gone, there are no servers.So, a few years back i would have told you to buy it, because the game was absolutely fantastic due to its amazing multiplayer, but now, i suggest you stay away and dont buy the game, because you wont be able to get the old experience from before.But, still, i will give this a Thumbs up, because i once came to love this game, and the game was a fantastic addition to my collection then, and because although you are best not buying this game anymore, it was a damn good one years back, and that deserves at least some apretiation from my part, so as a thanks, a Thumbs up for this once upon a time very good and ahead of its time Game. Thanks Frontlines, but i guess everything comes to an end.  Note: I will stress this here, so people, can understand and they dont let themselves fall into hole, The game is not playable anymore, there is no multiplayer, all servers have been shutdown, there is no way you will be able to play it online EVER again, do not yourselves get fooled, if you think there is such way, use it at your own risk. But it is from my experience that if something is too good to be true, then its because it is. Dont let yourselves take risks unnecesarily, its not worh it, i have been gaming for years now, so you can take my word for it, or maybe not, its your call, but i talk from experience.  "

												Have owned this game for too many year to count :) Absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone who loves battefield type games.  It's too bad the multiplayer servers are shutdown now since not too many ppl play it anymore.  If they could re-open it somehow and get the name on the headlines again that would be legit.5 star game			"

												A pretty solid single player experience as a near-future, open-world-ish, Military themed FPS. It's not a full open world, as it's one structured area per level. I think ""open level"" would be a better description. Think of a battlefield map that has your forces moving from one side of the map to the other (like the front line moving in the trailer). This open level mechanic is refreshing for a single player experience (that isn't battlefield with bots) compared to the modern military shooter campaigns which are very linear. There's still a hint of linearity as each mission is basically about 3 target objectives (at a time) you have to capture/destroy but you can pretty much get to each of them in whatever order you want. Then another 3, and so on, until you've basically hit ever point of interest in the large scale level. It plays out somewhat like Crysis (1) or FarCry (1), but better in my opinion because the combat comes sooner, is more sustained (more ammo, more bad guys, & less time traversing the map), you have allies to fight alongside you, you're given more choice via multiple simultaneous objectives, and the level design is more than just a jungle (it's an urban jungle)This game lets you use vehicles (tanks) but you can survive w/o having to use them (unlike fights in battlefield). Then there's also using drones (RC cars/helicopters with mounted guns/bombs), which occures quite often-more than I would wish in an FPS game but at least its not the majority (or even the entirety) of any particular mission and It's possible to get the through the mission w/o using them, though can be difficult at times.Graphics may be slightly dated, but they're unified and solid. Sound is generic but it gets the job done well enough without detracting too much from immersion. Dialog is simple, not much depth. Same with the plot, but this is good as it doesn't try to cram a bunch of narrative/history into your brain when you've come to play a shoot 'em up action game. The controls are tight. You have health regeneration so as long as you have cover, you can almost always stay alive. There are still times where you may die, but the open-world game mechanic makes dying less frustrating as you are not forced to follow the exact same path that just got you killed!!No aim down sights, just some weapons with scopes as alt fire. You're able to choose your ""class"" (pre-set loadout) if you die and have to respawn in the campaign.Overall, great fun playing the single player campaign as an open level shooter. I was disappointed with the last few levels in the cities as you couldn't enter many of the large buildings which greatly restricts your movement and attack options compared to the previous levels in the game.

												This is a fun game.It ain't Battlefield, though it certainly tries very hard. Bad news first: Servers are down, you won't find anyone to play with online. Thankfully, the single player mode has a lot to offer. If you're old enough to remember Battlefield 2 and how they said it'd have a single player campaign, I'm pretty sure that's what the designers of that old frigate had in mind when they thought about it, even though it never came through eventually (thanks for that, Obama!).Graphics are still decent, weapons are neat, vehicles rock. The little boondoggle drones keep ingame monotony down. The story is surprsingly well written. I really liked how much thought went into all that just-slightly-beyond-tomorrow-tech - the experience is similar to the recent 2020-future Cowadooties, though far less spectacular, of course. Still, the designer's artistic achievement is to be applauded, if Call of Duty Advanced Blabla comes up with pretty much the same ideas five years later. Naturally, the immersive aspect is rather reduced when compared to a big-budget game like Battlefield. Often you'll find yourself just blasting at simpleton foes or hammering away at a distant installation with and IFV chaingun. Nonetheless, I was playing through this game with a big grin on my face, if only because it actually felt like a good old GAME instead of these new overscripted pseudo-movies. I'd give the single player experience a straight 8/10, though that number drops significantly after the first pass.Like I said, a real fun game. Definitely recommended when on sale, you won't regret the four hours or so it takes to  finish. After that, go for two double cheeseburgers at Mickey D's and feel like you're 15 again and all's well with the world for about an hour.			"

												Man, I remember so many late nights playing this game.  Was a shot load of fun, esp when I would fly drones over a sniper and detonate right behind them.  So sad this entire company collapsed.I recently managed to locate the dedicated server files and was thinking about putting up a server and hopefully finding maybe 10 or more people who would want a weekly game night for FFOW.    I dont even see any dedicated servers available for rent anymore so I doubt anyone plays much.  Any interest?  Hit me up on steam.BEWARE if you are buying this game:  I remember single player was fun but there is NO multiplayer.  You can start a LAN game but there are NO BOTS to play against.  So you better have friends pleb.			"

												Fantastic FPS, that I remember spending weeks playing when it first came out. This is the game that a lot of current FPS games learned some of their tricks from. The Campaign is fun, each mission is really long and broken up into usually 4 parts. There are not that many missions, but honestly the story gets told well, and I think there are enough missions to suit it. Some of the missions are fun enough to replay a few times, especially the defense segments, which this game excels at. Between Remote Control Droens, to Auto-Turrets, and stationary weapons you can place like the rail gun; you can have a lot of fun on these missions, and others.The multiplayer used to be fantastic, huge battlegrounds with jets, tanks, drones, and soldiers thrown into the mix made for some seriusly intense battles. Sadly this game doesn't have online multiplayer servers anymore, although there are some work-arounds if you can find the people to play with, and I know this game has a growing community here on Steam.Buy this game for its fantastic story and fun missions, consider the multiplayer a bonus if you are able to play it.

But it does a fine job of giving you fun, deadly toys to play with, from bread-and-butter handheld weapons to tanks to remote-controlled copters and rovers.  It also gives you enough space and options to choose how you want to approach each battle.  Even if it's not as polished, both these things make for a more fun experience than Modern Warfare.			"

												Fantastically fun game, but too short! I won't ding it for being short though. Graphically, it's on-par with even today's modern games. Gameplay, it's great. Competent, non-arcade-type gun play without the complexity of some of today's modern offerings. I've owned this game for _years_ and until looking to see if the publisher had done any further Frontlines games, I really never noticed that there was a multiplayer; yes, the option was there, but I guess I never really noticed it. I guess that this game never seemed like it would be a good MP, so maybe that was it; at least it didn't devolve in to some POS CoD or BF cheatfest gaming that only kids play these days, so maybe it's a good thing! Apparently you can still play on LAN though. So, can't ding it for lack of MP when I never noticed MP was really there.If you want a great FPS and will accept kind of a short story, check out Fuel of War, and its prequel or sequel Homefront from the same publisher.

You can unload 50 rounds into them and they are still standing. Some don't even die from a grenade explosion.Your team AI is horrble. They will get right in your line of fire and stand there.

												For 2-2,5 € it's a good buy. The Single player is very simple and easy to handle and learn. There are many ways and options to kill the enemy soldiers. I like the idea with the mini helicopters with rocket launchers, and drones, ect. :)But the SP looks a little short, and the biggest potential would be in the MP. But the servers are offline. :(If it is on a huge sale, i can hardly recommend the game. But for the full price, you can buy games with much more potential playtime :)			"

												When people say that in war ""bullets fly"", they're not wrong. And this game is faithful to that. It doesn't matter where you aim at, bullets will fly and hit all around your target until they hit it. Of course it's a nightmare, but adds a nice athsmosphere of truly being in the front line and having to use 100 bullets to hit an enemy. Best moment in the game: when a HUGE piece of metal passed by flying because of an explosion nearby. I tried to dodge it. In real life.			"

												This game is just plain fun. Played a few times back in the day, when I saw it on steam I wanted to play it again so I picked it up. Weapons are ok although the selection is limited and the machine guns are not accurate at all. Vehicles are great except the helicopter is hard for me to fly. Drones are really fun, the helicopter drone is the best and slightly overpowered. All objectives must be completed by you, and the AI doesn't seem to kill anyone ever, which means more work/fun for you.Definitely pick this game up, it is on sale all the time, including today as I type this.

												Frontline is not quite an unappreciated classic, but it very nearly might be. It came very close to dethroning the Battlefield franchise, not so much in sales (which were disappointing) as in capability. While Dice fiddled with odd settings (Battlefield 2142) and playing catch-up to Call of Duty (Battlefield 3), Kaos studios worked on perfecting the formula that made the original Battlefield games so much fun.With a mix of modern- and near-future combat, Frontline was both familiar and innovative. The use of remote-controlled drones was a great addition, and were tremendous fun to use. The shifting and eponymous frontline was also a great way to keep the action focused on a small part of a battlefield while still allowing huge maps. The gunplay was satisfying as well, requiring more skill and aiming than do the pray-n-spray combats of more modern FPS games.Unfortunately, the game never quite caught on the way it should have, an issue not helped in the least by the developers putting so little support into the game post-release. These days, the multiplayer arenas are all but empty. The single-player was fun, if a bit shallow and too quickly over.			"

												It is relatively pretty, and it filled my need for a brainless shooter.  I enjoyed the drone mechanic, although it was very rarely a useful feature.  The AI can sometimes be clever, but the challenge is mostly based on an endless supply of cannon fodder that seems to spawn out of closets and crates.  The environment looks large, but an invisible wall prevents you from really taking advantage of the landscape as much as you'd like.  Lastly,and probably most importantly the single player mission is SHORT.  This is good only for about five hours of play.  There's a small amount of replay-value, and I suppose the multiplayer and langaming maps add a significant amount of value for players who are into that.  For my uses, this is a game to be rescued from the bargain bin, played for a weekend, then never opened again.			"

												I never understood why this game is so underated. In fact it could be underated BECAUSE its so good for some reason ! The story has undertones critical of the Iraq War. Now Bush, Laney and 500 CIA agents cannot travel to Europe because there are arrest warrants out for them (go check if you don't believe me) that throws the games story into a very interesting light in retrospect, and I think it was meant as a kind of protest vote ... ""what's realy going on guys"" ? So that set the game play into an interesting context for me. I can only examine the single player campaign here as I have not tried the multiplayer part. I found everything about the single player combat here to be outstanding. The gun play and FPS combat is very fluid. The key innovation at the heart of the game's system is the remote drones. I've never seen any other game get this right with a seamless transition from the player soldier holding a control screen for the drone to looking out of the drone's camera and back again. So you can blast away with a drone, then leave it in some tactical location, switch back to the human first person view and do some fighting there, and then switch back to the drone again. The level design is still very good to this day and shows that less really is more. Many games these days try and cram too much into the scene and the focus is lost. This should be a very simple ""zen of 3D engine design"" but the point so often gets lost. Look at the levels in Frontlines. You eye is drawn to the most important elements because it's not distracted so the sense of place is enhanced as well as immersion. Cool ! My favourite level. The one when you can fly a helicopter as you approach a huge fortress. One last thing. If the ""distortion"" effect does not enable in the graphics settings, first apply very low settings, return to main menu, apply very high settings, return to main menu. Now distortion should be on and you can increase the other settings that were not set to full by ""very high"".			"

												Kaos studios has some talent behind their games, however it doesn't seem to be in the way of making the actual game. Get frontlines for a forgettable shooter you can play once, but don't expect to be very engaged. Some of the gadgets in the game are neat, and I can see where many of the ideas for Homefront came from. Unfortunately, most of the game is boring and cookie cutter. Frontlines also suffers from badguys take too many bullets syndrome. It's tough to kill enemies with the limited selection of weapons given to you.You might enjoy it once, but wait for a sale.

												Tons of fun. This one went under the radar, and I would confidently say that its SP campaign blows away anything that Activision (CoD) or DICE (BF) has produced in the last 10 years. FFOW has an interesting storyline, good gameplay concepts, and an overall good feeling. Very surprising, considering CHAOS Studios' 'Homeland' had a terrible campaign. There are a good variety of missions and players are able to use an assortment of vehicles and aircraft throughout the SP campaign. What I enjoy most is the ""hands off"", non-linear approach of the SP campaign. Certain missions will give you tanks, planes, drones, etc, but wont force you down a specific route. It's like the developers said ""Here are your objectives, here are your tools, you figure it out"". The maps are large enough so that players can actually develop a strategy and execute their own plan, this allows great re-playability on missions. My only gripe is that there is no COOP. A COOP campaign mode would be fantastic.			"

I finished two stages of the campaign on normal, checked my progress and found that I was halfway done. The primary gun shoots like a funnel and unless you are not moving and crouching don't expect anything to hit the enemy. On the subject of enemies, I've shot a couple in the head with a high powered rifle only to see them jerk their head slightly and keep coming at me like a terminator. The ""drones"" or RC cars are more of a gimmick than a useful tool, most are just a kamikaze bomb. The icing on the cake is apparently the multiplayer servers are down for good. So what are you buying? Three hours of gameplay.			"

												The single player is just a bunch of bot maches with a few meh cutscenes. The world building of a world on the brink due to fuel shortages could be interesting but since you don't personaly see anyone effected by it it doesn't have much impact. i wish the worldbuilding was bigger gameplay is solid.

I just bought it in steam cause my cd is messed up. I thought I was gonna be able to go online but you cant no more. you can only do LAN. Also this game says it has coop but it is not true.

												Simple:Pros:+ Nice Graphics.Cons:- Heavy CPU usage, with my i7, and 8 giga ram, and 512 GPU I still had lag, even when in idle states.- Bad gameplay.- Bad control system (unresponsive).- Too much gimmick, single shots will always kill anything. everything else is redundant or weaker.- Too much of the same. It looks like it was trying to get COD fanbase, then went after battlefield, then after Diablo fans, then the trainwreck started its derail process.... It has many features, while none are necessary or incentivate the player to use them			"

												This was basically an extra that came with the THQ pack I got when they were in business.  By now you should be aware that this is basically a single player game only.  I got around 9 hours worth on hardcore level.  Only had one crash on my XP computer. Had to DL a driver patch to make the game work. If they had a neutral button I would vote for that.  The game gives you generous amount of ammo and the ability to instantly heal yourself if you disengage from a firefight. You can't really count on your AI buddies to save you. More than once the enemy would stroll up to around shotgun range and shoot at me ignoring my friendly AI, while my AI buddies kinda danced around missing or ignoring the enemy.  So basically your AI buddies help you locate the enemy by shooting in their direction. You also use some type of radar that  lights of the enemy in a red circle when you see them. Not sure why you would have this on on hardcore mode. This game is really easy especially when you have a tank. Just go forward, shoot, go back and repeat. Hide to get repaired if necessary. You also get plently of lives to finish a mission. I'm not sure if you have the ability to change your loadout before a mission starts, but you do have that ability when you die once. All in all not a bad game,but better games are out there. Also there seems to be 3 or 4 active nordic employees -_-			"

												Watching the trailer you might get the impression that this game features gritty and realistic combat, you might even think it looks like a pretty good Battlefield clone and you'd be wrong. Unfortunately the developers have done a really good job of misrepresenting the actual game play. Nothing in the actual game feels gritty or realistic. The enemies all look as if they're made of plastic and likewise their movement is rigid, almost as if they were a plastic toy. Their AI is a huge disappointment, there is no intelligence in their actions. They do the minimum of what is required in order to impede your progress, but that's it.The weapons all attempt and fail to be futuristic versions of modern weaponry. They sound weak and are extremely inaccurate, which combined with the enemies unintelligent AI and plastic look ends up leaving a very unsatisfied feeling upon killing them.The single player campaign is short, and contrary to what the developers claim it is also very linear and scripted. At no time during a mission did I ever feel as if I had any real choices as to how I was going to approach any given situation. The drones for example sound like a promising concept, but they fall short. It's almost as if they could have given a person a choice in how to fight or accomplish a given task. In reality though they never felt truly useful because they lack any real use on the battlefield outside of several scripted/forced events, this results in them feeling as if they're nothing more than a prop on a stage.Most of the maps are large and a couple of them are okay in their design, I almost enjoyed playing them, unfortunately though they're over shadowed by the games numerous shortcomings.No matter how low the price may be, I can not recommend it. Save your money and time.			"

												It was sold at a really low price but on the other hand, it was a rather bad game even though it held a rather high pace throughout the whole game. The AI was close to abysmal - both friendly and enemy AI - and the levels were basically multiplayer levels with some story attached to it... much like the single player part of Battlefield 1942 (except that game had no story at all).In short, it was not a really good game.

												It is hard to begin where this game just lets me down, if it were not 2.99 I'd have never have tried it(yay sale) and even then I wish I could get my money back. What we have is a poor man's dystopian FPS that feels like it tried to cash in on COD, with a plot so thin you can see through it, and gameplay I'd attribute to a game 10 years in the past during the PS2 and 1 era. It is very obvious out the gate the devs wanted you to do multi player and the ""Story"" mode was just a 4 hour time wasintg tutorial with lackluster characters you can never identify with let alone like.The final straw for me however, was the lousy bugs as well as the AEGIS physics engine bug that requires you to roll back your drivers if using anything beyond and 8600. Overall, i'd not wish this game on anyone, if you truly need the FPS, war is hell feel, wait for Call fo Duty to go on sale or some such.			"

The story is not too bad. ""The world is running out of oil so we need to start a war to make sure America gets the last of it"" but it could be more indepth or realistic and the characters are really undeveloped. One thing I did like was the drones that could be controlled and the single player campain while short was a good way to spend a few hours but overall it is not enough to recommend this game since there are much better shooter games out there.

												I'm not even going to knock the game for needing two legacy drivers (audio and video) because the issues are so well documented that it only took a few minutes to fix. I will, however, say that I can't recommend this game to anyone. It's not poorly made. The graphics are well made for it's time and everything functions as it should. Unfortunately the gameplay is entirely inferior to those who have come before it. Single player consists of a series of Call of Duty style narrative maps with the addition of a squad of bots to help you against the enemy. Unfortunately the boys are invulerable and not terribly helpful. They will never accomplish much other than blocking your line of fire because they appear to not understand objectives and since they don't die they never do things like hold a postion while you flank because the second the bots find a path to you they simply run forward and wherever you're emerging from becomes the front line.My advice: play Unreal Tournament on assualt maps. There's no poorly written story but the bots feel like actual members of your team and are actually working to acheive the same objective you are rather than just being placeholders to make you feel less alone.

												i played this game on a friends xbox and so wanted to get it on here... the game itself is very fun (be warned the online play is dead by now i believe from what ive been reading, i couldnt confirm and i will get to that in a sec)drones are a particularly interesting part of the game...However! The game will not run without a particularly ancient version of physX... downgrading drivers, at least for my comp as i dont have the nvidia version of physx and thats what it wants... while im sure its possible to downgrade to that drive, i wasnt able to, dispite totally uninstaling physx and trying the included version in the game, which refused to install...Addition: Those of you thinking of this game, look on the public hub for it... you will see issues like what i stated above are fairly wide spread			"

												I played the singleplayer campaign only so the review will cover just my experience with that.I started on the hardest difficulty to begin with and later had to lower it because of getting frustrated. some of the problems I was experiencing were glitching enemies and mission checkpoints not activating and having to restart the level.What I found to be the most aggrivating though was the accurracy of the weapons. The most common weapon you have access to is the Assault Rifle and the accurracy on that gun is amazingly bad, even when you pulse fire it you'd be fortunate enough to hit your target at 5 feet away.The weapons that were most accurrate were the sniper rifle, your pistol, and of all things the SMG. I found myself using the SMG class as often as possible and managing to kill all my enemies from long range with it. If I was ever forced to use the Assault Rifle class then I would use the Noobtube on it and the pistol.Frontlines: Fuel of War had some features I enjoyed such as disposing of whatever ammunition was left in a magazine when you reloaded. Example, you have 5/10 bullets in a magazine and reload, you THROW AWAY those 5 bullets. This makes you not continually spam reload after every short burst. I also enjoy the whole conquest format that is essentially the entire base of the game.I do feel that it all came up a little too short and this is not a game I would recommend.			"

												A game that sounds like it has promise, but is just yet another dead Modern shooter.The Unreal engine is used to yet again deliver a completely dead/feedback free experience. No gun feels any different, nothing is visceral at all.On hardcore, the enemies are laughably stupid and your regen speed negates any feeling of tension.Boring as get-out and just flat. Music is wonderful however, I will purchase the OST from Amazon and consider that money well spent. The game, however, is best if you skip it.			"

												Avoid this game. I got it just for 3$ in a steam sale and still regret buying it. The game is trying to take aspects of Battlefield like large maps, vehicles and such but fails miserably. Even some of the single player maps are redone multiplayer maps with the only objective being to capture points rather than have any meaningful single player objectives.Pros+ The weapon technology is fun to fiddle around with+ The fight over fuel story had some promise.+ The game is short so you will be done with it soon enoughCons- Boring single player campaign objectives and difficulty.- Getting shot at from random directions.- Guns feel pretty flat. Only the sniper had some kick behind it,I ended up steeling myself and finishing the game but I don't intend to ever play this again. I would only recommend this game for those wanting a quick FPS campaign runthrough if you get it for real cheap in a sale. Otherwise, cannot recommend!			"

It has better graphics than games that are coming out today. It's too bad that the online multiplayer was shutdown. But if you can get a group of friends to get it, LAN still works. I played this game a ton on the xbox 360. The Xbox version even supported 50 players in one match while PC version supported 64. That was huge in 2008. It's a ton of fun. Environments are partially destructable in case you don't like the other team's house and you have a tank.			"

												This game is a lot of fun. However, if you are looking for a long lasting FPS you can get tens of hours on, you won't. I played through the campaign twice and look at my hours. The campaign is alright, its cheesy at parts, but the voice acting is good. The guns shoot funny. The description also says its open world, which it isnt. It is very linear. If they mean that in the sense that you can walk around wherever on the map you are on, then that is correct, but it is definetly not like GTA or Assassins Creed in that sense.Overall, It's an okay game, fun while it lasts.

												Bought this game a couple of years ago while it was on a -75% sale. Good thing that I didn't pay more for it because the game is pretty lame. There are older games than this that look and play much better than this one. Also, you have to empty your whole gun magazine on an enemy grunt before he bites the dust, while you are nearly dead after 3 shots or something.There used to be a multiplayer function, but sadly I've never been able to play it because THQ decided to permanently shut down the multiplayer servers (lame). I repeat, there is NO MULTIPLAYER (only LAN). So don't buy this game. Even though you can't even buy it on Steam anymore, don't buy it elsewhere either. It's not worth it. Better just download it if you want to play the (very short) SP campaign. There's no support from THQ anymore so you shouldn't support them either by buying this game.			"

												One of the most underestimated FPS games arround.The negative reviews should not keep you from buying this game.Check youtube for some gameplay footage and decide if this is worth purchasing.The missing multiplayer option is not 100% accurate. The masterservers have been shut down long ago. But you can still connect to a server, either via the developers console, or  use Evolve gameserver tool. You can also still host a server without problems.If you should get a physx error after a fresh install and first time launch of the game, then you need to download Nvidia's PhysX Legacy drivers. And voila the game will run.Link : http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.12.1031-legacy-driver.htmlI hope this review will help you a bit. The rest is up to you :)			"

												Frontlines : Fuel of War is, in summary, one of the many quickly pumped out games of the battlefield era that looks great but just does'nt stand out from the group on its own merits. This reflects in the lack of online following, and considering the single player campaign mode is simpily there to tick the ""offline"" box so to speak. While playing you will fire bullet hoses with no feel or accuracy at enemys that are basicly uneffected by bullets unless you smuther them to death in 'em. This bullet resistance is also rather prevelent in your own near immortality.The mutiplayer is just uninspiring, an attempt in COD that falls way short of the mark, so basicly your left with the abominable single player. You do get to play with remote control toys here and there, and drive your infinity far superior jeeps around, but its all smothered in this blanket of fuzzy, detached controls.Its a shame as they hve obviously put some time into some of the graphics.Id recommend COD or killzone2.

												These days there are so many games that are truly dismal that it's hard to pick out a diamond in the rough. I was skeptical when I first got this game, thinking that it was going to be some cheesy rehash of the old school delta force series and graphics to match. What I found was a visually impressive game with some really fun mechanics and a storyline that was actually engaging. Frontline doesn't market itself well but in the age when everyone who owns a computer starts making crappy ""Free-To-Play"" games, I'm actually very pleased with it. I know it's a few years old but it was refreshing to see a non mainstream game/name (ie Halo) actually exceed my expectations. Parts of the game that are a bit wonky but all in all it kept me engaged for the duration of the Solo Campaign. And after all, isn't that all you can ask for in a video game? Maybe I was impressed because of my low expectations, or maybe, just maybe; might I dare to venture that Kaos Studios has actually made a decent one.			"

												ok so when you purchase this game the first thing you have to do is go to the nvidia website and download the legacy driver otherwise this game wil come up with a stupid agia physics missing error and WILL NOT LAUNCH and it will drive you mental.I started the game and had a sound hardware error which was stupid. no sound but to be honest the game mechanics allow you to easily play without sound. graphics completely maxed out still seem outdated for a 2009 release. however I have to say that graphics don't make or break a good game. frontlines offers a multiple path choice play style which I am rather a fan of in an fps. its great to be able to choose how you want to get to a target. i thought the health system could do with some improvement. I semed to get hit a hell of a lot yet didnt seem to lose much in the way of health, and I found the constant birage of new spawning enemies somewhat unrealistic. however if you like a tactical run and gun style gameplay with constant enemy attacks to overcome then this is a good game choice.I thought the size of this game was a little on the high end. (above 10gb) but I gues for the age of it and the probable unnecessary programming for the time I cant complain to much. I just wish it had been a bit longer play time for the size.overall, now that I have the sound issue fixed, I found this to be an enjoyable title. Hovever for the age and play, I found the original farcry to be a much better more well thought out game, except for the 2 stupidly annoying boss battles. my oppinion if you want this game get it and you shouldnt regret it, but get the original farcry aswell and note the difference for yourself.

												The single player part of the game is well worth the sale price. Very few people still play the multiplayer part of the game.			"

												The game was intense, I thought I would never get to finish playing the whole game. Graohics where right to suit PC.			"

												Heyyo, the campaign is lots of fun... but multiplayer was imbalanced with flying RC helicopters with rocket launchers compared to the other team's nerfed land-rover with basic assault rifle... sigh. This game had lots of promise too... since it was a lot of ex-devs from Desert Combat mod for BF1942 and also BF2.			"

												Just all around not a good game. I bought it on sale for $2.50 a long time ago. Wish I could give it back and the few hours I spent on it. If you want this type of shooter, wait for Battlefield 3 or get Bad Company 2. Shame on you Frontlines for being so bad.			"

												Plausible starting scenario and cool gadgets, but poor AI, a glitchy engine, half-hearted squad AI/plot, and a series of implausible and unsatisfying plot twists make for a mediocre once-through on single-player. (Haven't bothered with multi).			"

												Look, i've posted good reviews, i've posted bat ones, but this may be the only review that i've had trouble deciding on weather it's good or bad. FFOW is a game that i bought for $5 because it was on sale. Although made in '08, FFOW presents us with aspects ahead of it's time. I mean, i own Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, and i instantly saw aspects of that here. But honestly, the only part that makes me indecisive here, is the fact that they seem to have canceled the multi-player. This may just be my own computer, but it looks like it's over (As is the case with some other older FPS games, some of which would have had merit had the designers bothered to keep the servers up) It is a nicly made game with good concepts, but all-in-all, 7/10.

												This is my first and probably one review of a game I will ever do. Why am I writing this? Because this game is great! Really too good to not recommend!Its 2017 and I have been playing hundreds of game since this one (mostly on PC) and I still cant find a game that has a better storymode than this. It is never boring and very versatile. You go from different missons but all the time for the same goal and even if the game is linear in a way you still feel free and do not ever have to think about glitches or controls restraining you in the progress of moving forward.The only thing that is a bit sad about this game is that it is short. Therefore I will match this review keeping it short aswell.Thanks for reading			"

												Bought this game a couple of years ago while it was on a -75% sale. Good thing that I didn't pay more for it because the game is pretty lame. There are older games than this that look and play much better than this one. Also, you have to empty your whole gun magazine on an enemy grunt before he bites the dust, while you are nearly dead after 3 shots or something.There used to be a multiplayer function, but sadly I've never been able to play it because THQ decided to permanently shut down the multiplayer servers (lame). I repeat, there is NO MULTIPLAYER (only LAN). So don't buy this game. Even though you can't even buy it on Steam anymore, don't buy it elsewhere either. It's not worth it. Better just download it if you want to play the (very short) SP campaign. There's no support from THQ anymore so you shouldn't support them either by buying this game.			"
