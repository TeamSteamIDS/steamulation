												No game will ever affect me as much as BioShock Infinite did.After playing through the game three times (twice on Xbox 360 & once on PC) it still upsets me that Irrational signed over the series permanently.I'm going to keep this clean of any spoilers and say that this was a brilliant end to the revolution of the trilogy, and that Burial at Sea episodes One & Two are to be considered absolutely mandatory if you are to play this game properly.This game has been one of only a few games, that has brought me to tears on more than one occasion. Call me a cry baby or whatever, but I am as passionate about this series as any fanatic is about whatever they are obsessed with.BioShock will always have a special place in my life post of completing Infinite.I would recommend not only this game, but BioShock, BioShock 2 also.If you are thinking about buying this, do it, have fun, and pay attention.

												Like the first game, Bioshock Infinite is a very thematically ambitious game. One that begins to elevate storytelling in gaming. There will surely be a lot of discussion to follow with this one. There's a lot of care taken with the world in which it takes place in, as well as with some of the themes it handles. And Bioshock Infinite opts to hold very little back. Here you'll be tackling themes such as racism, religion, false prophets, gender roles, even moments that will test your own morals. It's got a lot to say. The story and the world also come to life in the same way that Rapture does. While Columbia is not as dazzling as the trip into the underwater world, it does have a pulse just the same. You'll find Voxphones scattered throughout. These, like the original Bioshocks audio diaries, add a lot more to the tale at hand. They add to the story, the world and the atmosphere. To ignore them is to miss out on a considerable portion of the game. For those very curious about the world they're playing in, they will most certainly want to pick these up.The world of Columbia is wider and more open than the claustrophobic and enclosed Rapture, gun fights involve more enemies than the original Bioshock. The problem with this is that it devalues the fights itself. In the original Bioshock, enemies were something to fear. Even the most basic ones could do damage to you if you're not prepared. In Infinite, most enemies are just faceless guards who you just simply have to shoot in order to progress to other parts of the story. Most fights just end up repetitive, and though the game allows you to use various methods such as vigors and skyhooks to defeat enemies, rarely do you ever need to. Most of the game you're grossly overpowered, even if you're not upgrading your vigors or weapons.Another thing, though admittedly it's a nitpick, the dissonance between the beautiful story and the violent shooting is something worth mentioning. Sometimes the dialogue and the ""breather"" scenes seem to be slightly disrupted by the high amounts of adrenaline shooting that follows. It's not enough to ruin the experience, but it's certainly something that could be done better. Less emphasis on gunplay and maybe some more exploration elements could benefit this game.Bioshock Infinite isn't a perfect game, but it is a great one. A thematically ambitious game with a well told story, Bioshock Infinite is sure to delight fans who fell in love with the original back in 2007. It is a game that not only delivers well from a gameplay standpoint, but from a narrative one as well. If you enjoyed exploring the world of Rapture in 2007, then you'll love going through the land of Columbia, here.			"

Note: Play the games in this orderBioshock 1 > Bioshock 2 > Bioshock InfiniteThe year is 1912 and you play as Booker DeWitt and you've been tasked with saving  a girl, Elizabeth , in the city of Columbia. The game is an Action FPS that is true to its genre. The game offers a fairly fast paced action that might sometimes feel a bit tedious. Bioshock Infinite contains a multitude of weapons that are era specific and are lovely to use.You also have access to powers, known as vigors, which you can use to dispose of enemies or to just help you make your way through the game. The vigors can also be combined with each other making it an intriguing system to play around with.In addition to Weapons and Vigors you have other tools, like the skyhook, which lets you jump around from hooks attached to the side off certain buildings.The stealth system within the game is good. The detection is based around both sound and vision so walking on a carpet can suppress your footsteps while walking on puddles of water or broken glass will make them louder.The games scenery and enviroments are absolutely outstanding. When I got the first glimpse of Columbia I was speechless. The voice acting in the game is great as well with excellent dialogue. I'm quite serious now, I can't describe how PERFECT some parts were with how the characters acted and what they said. This game has brought forward some amazing quotes. In addition to that, all of the characters are well made and very sympathetic. I like games that have a good story, and Bioshock Infinite has just that. The story  is incredibly rich when it comes to content and will leave you with memorable parts that will make you smile when you think back.Bioshock Infinite is a game that you will not regret playing. It's fantastic.edit - removed Chrono order to please people.			"

												I don't think I've ever fancied a video game character before Elizabeth... Whilst my hours on steam don't reflect my actual playing time, as I've completed this game way too many times on my PS3, I just can't express how much I love this. It's my favourite ever game, and here's why:1) The plot is incredible, and has real substance. I've never completed a game more than once before, because I find playing the same story line tiring. However, this is an exception. The story line is phenomenal. I find myself being totally, and utterly, immersed in the world of Columbia. I have a real sense of ""belonging"" within the game which sounds a bit weird, but I don't really know how I can explain it. Brooker DeWitt and Elizabeth are both very strong characters, with great backstories, and the way these stories collide with each other is thought provoking, fantastically executed and cleverly directed.2) The graphics are visually stunning. The joy of playing this game with ultra settings, is one to be behold. If you're looking for a game with a wealth of detail, this is the one. Characters and scenery look great in the cut scenes and during game play. The lighting is just right throughout, and to me, fire has never before looked so good.3) The characters are strong, witty, and badass. And whoever voiced the characters need a medal, because I couldn't imagine anyone else stepping up to deliver what these guys have delivered. 4)  Combat. Is. Awesome. I never really liked gore in a game before, but I really enjoyed this, with just the right amount of gore included. Not just that, it's really easy to pick up which I love, and seem to have trouble with in other games.The only real criticism I can think of is the lack of DLC's available, and wishing that the story went on just that little bit longer. I didn't want it to end. Other than that, I really can't fault it. You're not just buying a game here, you're literally buying an entire world. Three hundred thumbs up from me!			"

												What drives a man of God to wash away the sins of his past, only to blacken his heart with a multitude more? How far can a freedom fighter be pushed before virtue and righteousness are replaced by a lust for vengeance? What does a privileged society do when the foundation of its prosperity is shaken? BioShock Infinite dares to explore these heady themes and many more, giving you glimpses at just how the seemingly smallest of decisions can forever alter our realities, and our hearts. As an agent provocateur in the fantastical floating city of Columbia, your actions bring turmoil and strife to an ostensibly idyllic landscape. It's immensely fun to stir up trouble, and even more engaging to see how boldly BioShock Infinite portrays a society torn asunder. You'll be haunted by this thematically devastating adventure, and indeed, its phenomenal final minutes, which are bound to be discussed and dissected for some time to come. Superb!			"

												Rise above the clouds and say hello to the city of Columbia, a place that changes the whole concept of how a video game should look.It's hard to say when Infinite evolved from a regular sequel into a terrific piece of art, but here it is. Even though it seems to ignore pretty much everything the original BioShock had to offer in terms of narration, the game not only bears the same idea but also expands it widely, moving the series far beyond any borders.The story now is much, much more complex. A standard rescue quest soon turns into a great adventure full of amazing twists, also featuring tons of different references, including physics, philosophy, religion, politics and many other things. By the way, it doesn't apply to the base game only — the Burial at Sea DLCs are necessary for understanding the wonderful cycle of the series. No examples here, for the whole story is worth seeing.Not to mention the gameplay mechanics which appear to be a simplified variation of the first game's scheme: easy enough to keep the fast pace and yet deep enough to let the player choose their way of dealing with problems. No more hacking mini-games or complicated stealth tactics, though, but if one is looking for some challenge, there is always 1999 mode that can make it feel like home. These facts, together with detailed design and, of course, outstanding visuals, make it hard to deny that the BioShock franchise is nearing perfection. Irrational Games use every single instrument the gaming industry has discovered to make their own beautiful symphony — and to finally make a perfect distinction between mediocre video games and a masterpiece.

												Whoever says games can't be considered ""Art"" probably never played any BioShock game.BioShock Infinite brings entertainment to another level, I haven't had fun with a game for a long time. That doesn't mean all the others releases are bad but it's been a while since i had so much fun playing a game.The plot it's one of the best i've seen in my entire gaming life, matching some Visual Novels and books i love (i kinda like a good plot and not the usual mindless action or generic shooting gallery we get most of the time). I don't think you'll find another game with a better quality plot anytime soon.Graphics aren't realistic but that doesn't mean they are bad, they got kinda a unique style that makes everything beautiful. You could say they are the same as the older games but they certainly improved a lot. However i kinda get annoyed with the excessive ""bloom"" in some scenes, sometimes they are overused to the point of blinding you. Aside from that everything else is beautiful. There's the music, honestly it isn't great but it's not bad either, the combat music is the same for the whole game save some specific scenes and it gets repetitive after a while. It's average at best.The gameplay is what you've already seen in BioShock 1 & 2 with some improvements. You can equip gears that gives you a few improvements like auto-casting lightning when you are struck or put your enemies on fire when you strike them with melee attacks.There's the new ""Sky-Line"" mechanic that allows you to travel around the place and can even be used in your advantage during combat, your partner Elizabeth even rides with you.And talking about Elizabeth, that's one hell of a companion. She is like Alyx in Half-Life 2: Episode One but instead of fighting she gives you support during and outside combat like finding and giving you ammo, salt, money and even warning about points of interest and some missable items like lockpicks. I love when i'm almost out of ammo and she throws me some ammo, she also plays a huge role in the plot.Honestly i haven't cared about my companion in a single-player game since Alyx, she isn't useless like most companions who doesn't do jack aside from yelling at you all the time like 'AIM DOWN YOUR SIGHTS"", "" TAKE POINT"", ""THEY ARE KILLING US DO SOMETHING!!!"". PC port is above average, there isn't much graphics options but at least the game runs great, without vsync the game always run above 60fps (sometimes going up to 90fps) with everything maxed out and the game has some pretty graphics.It took me around 13 hours to beat the game.My rate: 9,5			"

												Having played the main story on the hardest setting and completed all the DLCs I have to say: I absolutely love BioShock Infinite. Positive:- Extremely beautiful and atmospheric settings - as to be expected of a BioShock game- Fantastic, intense and unexpected storyline- DLCs actually deliver new and exciting storylines and game play- Great voice-acting and music overall- Responsive controls- I enjoyed only being able to hold two weapons at a time (unlike the other two BioShock games). It allows you to adjust to the situation by providing different weapons for you to pick up, or stick to your preferred play-style without scrolling through a huge inventory of weapons- No escorting: Elizabeth takes care of herself and helps you from time to time- You are rewarded for exploring- Challenging battles that remain exciting throughout the gameNegative:- I always found it strange that you take fall damage, but not when jumping off the sky line- Personally I found the crows + shock jockey combo to be extremely over-powered - The main story is only approximately 10 hours long- Less exploration than BioShock 1 and 2- Quite linear Conclusion:If you like BioShock then Infinite is a must - it delivers what you would expect plus more. Fantastic game-play, intensely atmospheric environments, unforgetable story, and DLCs that connect Infinite to the original BioShock games (it will blow your mind). This is the only game I have ever pre-ordered and I do not regret it at all.			"

												Where do I even begin? I had a great time playing Bioshock Infinite. I managed to complete it twice, and am considering a third playthrough. Similar to previous games, the story is original and very well written. It kept me interested throughout the game and despite my initial apprehension towards Elizabeth’s naïve character; I ended up really liking her as a “sidekick”, because that’s essentially what she is throughout the entire game. I enjoyed the numerous twists and turns of the story, and the ending absolutely blew me away.The gameplay is one of my favourite elements of Infinite. The new Skyrail system has transformed the dark and linear corridors of Rapture into a vast and open battlefield. The weapons are great fun to use, including the audio, with piano key drops that blare out when you land a headshot (soooo satisfying). The plasmid equivalent vigor abilities are nothing too special. Some are similar to previous Bioshock games while others introduce new things like forming a protective shield to absorb bullets and blast them back at your foes. There are some interesting combinations you can do with the vigor’s, which leads to many choices during combat.When compared to its predecessors, I felt Infinite lacked the horror elements that made me such a big fan of the first two games. In Rapture, everything was dark and gloomy so horror came naturally. In the floating city of Columbia, it was much harder to feel like it was part of the Bioshock universe. The secondary antagonist, Songbird is creepy and he does his best to keep the Big Daddy theme going, but the lack of creepy enemies just upset me. The boys of sound and sirens were my most anticipated enemies that I saw in the trailers for the game, but they had such a small role in the final game. Despite the lack of horror, Infinite managed to make me question my own understanding of what Bioshock is about and gave me lasting memories of a truly epic game.  "

Must haveI don't always finish my games, but when I played Bioshock Infinite, I finished it twice. DLCs included. Masterpiece.All the ingredient of success : fun gameplay, beautiful graphics and world design, incredible story.Pros :- Incredible story, with stunning details and love put into the creation of this universe.- Characters are fabulous, with background story for all of them, if you wish to learn more about the universe.- Wonderful art and world design. Columbia lives up to Rapture's hype. - Elizabeth.- DLCs in pre-civil war Rapture. Wonderful to see the city alive.- Gameplay is smooth, and unlike what some comments might have said, combat is nervous. I liked it anyways, and it's an improvement on the previous titles.- Perfectly suited soundtrack.Cons :- You'll never be happy again.- You'll need to google the ending because you'll be mindf*cked, especially if you are not native english speaker and play the game in english.- You'll have to explain your soulmate why you want to name your daughter Elizabeth.

This award category literally screams BioShock and between the first one and Infinite, I'll go with the most mind blown dealt between the two. I remember finishing the game and just sat there thinking, ""...What the hell just happened?"". I proceed to go online for more clarification about the ending (yes, I didn't really get it at first). This game is simply a masterpiece and I hope someday, in the near future, they will announce a new BioShock even cooler and crazier than this one!			"

												BioShock: After playing the whole series of the game, I can defenitly say its a great game. Everything you know or, at least think you knew about the world we're living at, is all lies. In each of the games you start as a ""normal"" character, with a casual personality, that during the game change and become a new character with a different personality. The game is about mental games with your brain. You gain new  powers and new abilities the more you're progressing in the game. In each game, the story change alot on each move you make. The whole idea of BioShock game series is really cool in my opinon and so are the action scenes in it and the story of each game. I highly recommend on playing the game, but from the first to the last, one at a time to understand better the story of the games. Great game.			"

												Although it's a simplistic, heavily scripted, linear experience, it's one of the most optimized, visually appealing, interesting ones available. It's been a while since a game compelled me to write a review and if the price is right, I can absolutely recommend Bioshock Infinite.Unique aspects of Bioshock worth notingElizabeth's Pathfinding, Awareness & Helpfulness. In years prior many companions in games would get you caught, waste all of your ammo, die, or block you from progressing all while being totally silent. Elizabeth will toss you ammunition or money should she find any, will move out of your way if you walk close to her and will constantly make remarks about her surroundings.The use of the Sky Hook and Skylines. Sure, conventional methods of transportation are just fine and dandy but it certainly never hurts to think outside the box! It's quite an enjoyable experience zipping throughout Columbia on the Skylines while fighting enemies.Aspects of Bioshock Infinite worth praising● No Third Party Digital Rights Management. No limited amount of machine activations, no ""always online"" requirements, and no services other than Steam you need to sign into to play.● The Achievement Progress Saving System. You can reload checkpoints to accumulate kills and loot containers. And if you were to ever miss any Voxophones, Telescopes or Kinetoscopes,  you can simply go to ""Load Chapter"" and select the chapter you believe you missed it on and collect it. However, you have to be weary about Infusions as they have to be obtained in a consecutive playthrough.Aspects of Bioshock Infinite worth criticizing● No In-Game Option To Toggle HUD or Holster Weapon! This is an unfortunate trend in many 2K Games and 2K Games affiliate products going back years. Honestly, what's the point in developing such beautiful scenery if you're not going to have the ability to take screenshots of it without a Health bar, Shield bar, Vigor bar, your arm and your gun getting in the way?● 2 Weapon Limitation. In previous Bioshock titles you had access to a wide range of different weapons via a weapon wheel. This time around it's limited to just two weapons.● Lackluster amount of choices or alternative endings. For a game that's circled around infinite parallel universes with infinite possibilities, why does Bioshock Infinite have such a lackluster amount of meaningful choices or any sort of alternate ending? It's debatable if Bioshock Infinite really needed any but I certainly wouldn't want to be the individual aruguing for less.Development disagreements & degradation of the product!Bioshock Infinite was originally going to be more of an open world game with a variety of features but with disagreements in development accompanied with the limitations the product was facing on other platforms, they decided to scrap most of what they were working on to create the version you see before you. The product Irrational Games showcased at E3 2010 is significantly different compared to the product that's available to the consumer.Not every game has to have more than one ending, stealth mechanics, weapon customization, a third person player view, character customization, a variety of meaningful choices, manual save mechanics, modification development tools or have no scripted moments to be a decent game. Sure, any one of these features would have been great additions and dispite of the downgrade, I can absolutely recommend Bioshock Infinite if the price is right.			"

												OH MY GOD.The game sure did not get 94/100 from Metacritic for no proper reason.It's full of things to do, Main quest, Lots of side missions, Things to collect like weapon upgrades, Skill upgrades and Passive abilities, and of course, Easter Eggs to look for.The scenery you see in game is just amazing. Totally mind-blowing if you ask from me. It ranges from Rainy Seashore to up the skies in the Floating City, and all the way down to deep bottom of the Ocean. And the best part, you don't need very powerful computer for this game to funtion properly. I played with the 2nd lowest graphics, had my fps constant, and still was stunned by the beautiful views. Apart from landscape, the gameplay part is absolutely well-made.The gameplay contains mainly shooting and puzzles.The weapon models look really nice, and there are no bugs at all with animations.Some of the guns barrels even turn shining red from heat caused by constant shooting.You can blow your enemies up with RPG, shoot them as full of holes as Swiss Cheese,Abilities that you can use to turn your enemies into piles of ash, or to skyrocket them million miles away.Of course you don't need to always kill everyone. The game let's you choose most of the time whether to shoot or to stay in stealthy mode, looking out for threats and staying in shadows.The characters are easy to identify with.You just want to sit and keep playing, because the story is so entertaining and addictive.You want to see what's next, what is behind the next corner, what kind of enemies will you face.And, to be honest, there are merely no games without any bugs nowadays.I am talking about visual bugs, possible glitches and getting out of bounds.The bugs i got never killed me or prevented me to continue my adventure.For example, sometimes NPCs walked on places where they shouldn't have walked, Like on walls.But if you're into that kind of stuff, like i am, you're gonna find yourself going to places you were not supposed to go, and trying to find your way inside buildings, or outside areas, where you never was meant to be at.When i realized the credits were about to roll, i was a bit disappointed about the length of the game.It took me 14 hours to complete all the side missions, and main quest.It's not a long game, but it's very enjoyable. There's a lot of replay value too. Personally, that was one of the best Singleplayer shooters i've ever played. Totally recommended.Thanks for reading, hopefully this helped.-Nate			"

												I've always found the Bioshock universe interesting and really well done, unfortunately i dont really enjoy horror atmospheric games like Bioshock 1 & 2. This is exactly the reason i choose Bioshock Infinite. Bioshock infinite manages to put down a really good atmosphere just like part 1 and 2, it's kinda like this 1800's overly happy/goodlife style. And except for 1 or 2 horror atmospheric parts i really enjoyed walking through the flying and colorful world of Columbia. The scenery in this game is so amazing and i found myself often just standing still and enjoying the view.On to something different: The story and it's characters. Both are really interesting and well done. The story keeps itself interesting by introducing new things all game long. And by looting the world you'll find basic things like salt's, ammo, health etc. but also voxophones, these are audiofragments which expand on the story and give you more background information.  Someting i liked alot about Bioshock Infinite was the fact you travel with Elizabeth almost the whole game. It's something different, and although she doesnt really do much other than provide you with supplies and a bit of talking, it's better than traveling alone. However something you might need to do is search online for a explanation of the ending, because it's a really complex ending. There's alot of video's and sites explaining it, so it shouldn't be a problem finding something about it.Overall Bioshock Infinite is a amazing game, great story, great characters, great mechanics and a wonderfull world to explore. It's definitely a game that will keep you to thinking for a long time after you finished it.			"

												Taken as pure First-Person Shooters, Bioshock Infinite is not too different from past incarnations of the brand, resulting therefore in level (if not below) of many other productions of the same kind. The point is that define Bioshock Infinite a shooter would be an understatement, almost wrong. That created by Irrational Games is an experience almost essential for a video game that you define. A video game where sensory, emotional involvement and narrative, really make the difference going to erase the ""flaws"" from a revamped gameplay. Columbia is completely different from Rapture-is a cross-section of the contradictions of the American Society of the early ' 900: a world in which dive as in reading a good book, rich in facets and details, warm and welcoming; complete. It is an experience of great impact, capable of developing in us a strong empathy towards the protagonists, and let us rejoice and suffer with them at all times. It is one of the highest forms of art in gaming, where knowledge and freedom of expression are combined to form a mosaic that cannot leave indifferent. Bioshock Infinite is a far from perfect game, with many flaws, but you can't not love; It is impossible not to want. Why Bioshock Infinite is one of those productions that leave a mark in the game industry and the player, coming long remember and increasing the personal baggage.			"

												Finishing the BioShock trilogy is a thing with a happy and a sad eye. What 3 wonderful games. Stories are great, this is a amazing final in the air and in the dlc under water. Graphics there could be more details, more things to find but its very good. Sound is mostly wonderful. The game length could be longer ( i play game on hard and 1999 mode, DLC1, DLC2 2 times (easy & 1998 mode) and clash in clouds. So the weak point is there could be more areas to find, where they get the pigs? Is there a air service from earth or even a farm? I miss a few more spots like a hospital or something and there could be more places under the sea but this game is epic and only very low critic points. I only miss Bioshock 4 (near the earth core, on the moon or something and a connection between all games like Jack, Delta, Brokker could have the same DNA or Elenor is daugther or reincarnation of Elisabeth). Sadly there isnt. I give this game 97 %. What i dont like was Clash in the Clouds, to replay 14 rounds for 1 try to get a Blue Ribbon was a bit to much, but what a wonderful world is this Bioshock <3. Thx for reading and hopefully enjoy all 3 games like me or more.			"

												BioShock Infinite towers over the rest of the competition in terms of history, involvement in the narrative coherence of what is shown on screen, and above all for the incredible artistic choices that have allowed Columbia to be built and Elizabeth were born and breathe. However there are a number of deficiencies that affect the gameplay, so strongly to the past lies in the series, and the technical aspect of the game, sometimes rather backward. Which it is a shame because if more care and finishing aspects so crucial for a video game they had joined the incredible design work, we would have found ourselves in a masterpiece of indisputable value. But we are ""only"" in front of a shooter excellent.			"

												This game was actually a very pleasant surprise, particularly since i got it on sale just to try it out, and im glad to say it was well worth it.The game is a decent FPS with great graphics and smooth gameplay, characters are very well written, there is a reason to care what happens to them, the game provides a satisfying challenge on ultimate difficulty, there are no severe or gamebreaking bugs, havent experienced a single crash after 70+ hours of gameplay, the challenges and achievements all unlock properly and accordingly. However there are 2 aspects of the game which imo make it an above average shooter- the story and the game companion.The story is a deep, memorable, open for interpretation type, borderline philosophical, which sticks with you for some time even after you close the game. It did however take me 2 playthroughs to completely understand it, but i value the effort put into the story and how throughout the game they slowly reveal details to you, just to give you a totally unexpected finale.As for the follower/game companion, this game offers the most likable and usefull companion ive ever seen in a singleplayer game. I personally dont like followers because in most games they just block me in corridors, alert enemies to my presence, set off traps or make stupid remarks. Luckily Liz doesnt do any of these things and she also throws you ammo/health during combat when youre low, which makes you want to keep her around. The game comes with 2 DLCs- Clash in the Clouds (combat challenge based) and Burial at Sea. While ive enjoyed the main game and CitC DLC very much for above stated reasons, the events that take place in Burial at Sea DLC were at least from my point of view very confusing and anticlimatic. Probably because i havent played BioShock 1 or 2 prior to this game, and their stories are bound.CONCLUSIONNot to bother with numeric evaluation, lets just say i find this game to be exceptional. If you can, try this game out, absolutely recommended!			"

												BioShock Infinite is the final entry in the BioShock franchise, and while it's quite different from the previous two games, I think it's a good way to end; especially once you play through Burial at Sea - Episode Two; but I'll talk about that in its own review. This one will talk exclusively about the main game, while I'll write reviews for each of the DLCs. So, on to the review!What should I talk about first? I guess gameplay would be an important factor. In BioShock Infinite, the combat feels more frenetic; so to speak. Rather than focusing on exploration like the previous games, you'll usually move from one combat arena to the other; not literally, of course, there will be moments where you're free to explore a bit, but the game still feels pretty combat oriented. Not that it's something bad, considering that, in my opinion, the combat in this game is pretty good, with lots of options to dispatch enemies; from the different weapons, to the Vigors (Infinite's version of Plasmids), and Elizabeth's Tears. If there's something I'd complain about, though, is the fact that you're limited to carrying two weapons at the same time. Somewhat disappointing, but the variety of Vigors (and Vigor Combos) more than makes up for this. Also, the Sky-Hook is a great addition, allowing you to quickly move through certain areas, while also working as a melee weapon. Finally, there's the Tears. Elizabeth, who will be your companion for most of the game, can open them to bring things to help you out during combat, which is quite useful.As for the story, well, it's pretty good in my opinion. It starts out somewhat ""normal""; you're a guy sent to the city of Columbia to rescue a certain girl, but as it progresses, it gets more and more complex, in a good way. The characters are all pretty well written in my opinion, and a particular mention goes to the Lutece twins. Their dialogue always cracks me up a bit. Some people might feel that the main character, Booker, feels like a ""regular"" hero; you know, guy with a dark past, atoning for his sins, etc. Well, I'd say that's because, while being the playable character, Booker isn't the main character. The main character would be Elizabeth, and when you play through the game, it kinda makes sense. The story isn't about Booker's trip to Columbia, but rather about Elizabeth escaping from Columbia.And now, I'll dedicate a paragraph to Elizabeth. Like I mentioned above, I feel that the game is more about Elizabeth than about Booker. After all, she is kind of the driving force behind the plot; what moves it forward. And like I also mentioned, she'll be your companion for most of the game. Even then, the game doesn't feel like a long escort mission. During combat, Elizabeth helps you out; not fighting enemies directly, but by providing you supplies, opening tears to bring in help, and even warning you of powerful enemies. Outside combat, she'll wander on her own; not going too far away from you, but she'll still look at things that interest her, and might even find things you missed; she can also open doors for you through lockpicking. I think they did a great job at giving her a personality; she doesn't feel like another NPC at all, but rather as an actual person. Still, there are a few details here and there; just as an example, when lockpicking, she'll usually talk in a cheerful tone, which can feel out of place when, only a few minutes before, she was angry at Booker for something he did.The environments are superb. The city of Columbia is a pretty beautiful place, and I can see why they went with the ""city in the sky"" theme rather than going back to the bottom of the ocean. Not to say that Rapture wouldn't have looked good; in fact, you'll get to visit it in its prime in Burial at Sea! However, having a different setting was interesting, with 1912's Columbia providing a nice contrast to 1950's Rapture. The level design, by itself, is pretty good; still, most of the places you'll visit feel like combat arenas, consisting of big, open spaces, unlike Rapture's labyrinth-like structure. The soundtrack is pretty good as well.Well, I think that's all I can say about BioShock Infinite. Personally, my favourite BioShock game is BioShock 2, but even then, I think Infinite is an excellent game, which is why I recommend it.			"

												Considering no one has made a fully objective review that analyzes actually positive aspects of this game, I took it upon myself to make one.Let's start with the bad aspects. Mainly, the gameplay. Bioshock had revolutionary gameplay; plasmids were extremely versatile and can be used for many things. Solving puzzles, starting attack combos, destroying machinery, and more. Along with the customization of upgrades and gear and great stealth mechanics, Bioshock had stellar gameplay and was different than almost all FPS's of it's time. That is, until Infinite showed up.The game is mechanically fun. The soundtrack and noises are amazing, and help set up the atmosphere and establish that Booker is ruthless and indifferent. The gameplay is also pretty rad in that setting up traps and using a combination of vigors is always fun. Objectively, however, it does not compare with the first game. Almost no puzzles can be solved with the vigors, and everything is pretty linear. It's strange that Infinite tries to go for an almost open world gameplay style where you can go back to places you've already visited for extra bonuses, considering it's pretty damn linear. It doesn't blend well, and going back a mile is not really good design. I don't think the average person would go back at all.The gameplay is also somewhat repetitive. At times it seems like the average AAA title where you're just filling random people coming at you with lead. The system where you can see where you're supposed to go to finish a quest/mission is pretty awful too. Sure, Infinite might have needed it considering theres so much to visit and you may be confused with the addition of skylines, but it's still not very good design. It's blatantly telling you, ""hey, go here to finish the quest!""Some design choices were also awful. Probably the only formidable foe is the handyman (which is btw, practically a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ big daddy rip off), and it only shows up like 3 times. Another design choice that annoyed me was the failed potential of Elizabeth's prowess. You would think opening up rifts to different universes would be awesome, but no. Instead, it's literally just summoning ammo and guns from nowhere.I'll cut the wall of text- the gameplay is more mediocre than the first Bioshock. It's not revolutionary and it has its fair share of flaws. It's still pretty damn cool though, and I'd personally say the gameplay is better than most Triple A gameplay.To say I didnt enjoy it is completely wrong. As a narrative, the game is amazing.Sure, most people don't play games as a medium of critical storytelling- literature and film exist, after all. However, games can easily show critical value and Infinite represents this.The characters grow increasingly complex as you see more of their dialogue. Booker is extremely interesting. He's completely desensitized to everything- yet so fragile. It is commonly shown that Booker hardly hesitates when it comes to death and dismay. When asked about this, he even states, ""One thing I've learned, if you don't draw first, you don't get to draw at all."" It is suggested that the events he's been through at the battle of wounded knee made him the person he is. The event adds significant internal strife to his character; he knows he's done wrong and sinned, and he can't do anything to fix it. As stated by him, ""You think a dip in the river is gonna wash away the things I've done?"" Perhaps the highlight of his corrupt mind is shown when (major spoilers) he even gives away his daughter in attempts to repay his gambling debts. His fragility is shown throughout the game as well, especially torwards the end. Unlike his character, he starts to deeply care for Elizabeth and puts himself in extremely wreckless situations in attempts to protect her. When she tries to kill Comstock, he tells her that instead they should just relax in paris. He wants to run away rather than confronting Comstock. He refuses to be  baptized at the last second, showing his common trait of wanting to run away. He is emotionally scarred and he continues to prefer running away than confrontation at many times. He becomes extremely protective of Elizabeth to the point where it's obsessive and wants to prevent her from harm. It isn't much of an exaggeration to say he's fragile.Elizabeth is also a deeply interesting character. Being caged throughout her whole life and forced to have only the companion of a mechanical bird, Elizabeth desires freedom and relishes it. She's stuck between a rock and a hard place- she can go back to her tower and be restrained and watched her whole life, or go with Booker to whatever the ♥♥♥♥ and be utilized to get rid of his gambling debts. She does care for Booker, though she doesn't show it often. Also with the strange ability of opening rifts to different timelines, it is suggested she feels somewhat alienated from humanity. Given that she practically has a massive hatred torwards everyone and every group throughout the game including booker and yet she's forced to stay strong and go with Booker, her character is pretty tragic.Finally, the Vox Populi is really damn cool. It's much more than just a terrorist group with guns; they were so obsessed with gaining liberty and freedom that it turned into something much different. They changed from fighting for justice to fighting simply just for actual blind hatred torwards Comstock and his people. This is easily exemplified with Fitzroy about to kill the child just because of plain hatred for his family and their increasingly brutal standards for killing enemies. The concept of Columbia was bound to have internal strife, and the Vox Populi illustrates this well.Not only are the characters are well made, but also the intricate plot.It's a highly intelligent story, yet it doesn't try to flaunt it and end up being pretentious. The ending, like the first game, is a complete plot twist. It changes everything you know about the characters. Who the Lutece Twins really are, who Comstock really is, what elizabeth represents, and more. The game is truely a masterpiece in delivery, and at too many times during the ending I had my mouth open when I realized in my head what happened. You can also find out more about the plot the more you listen to the voxophones you find during the game. It is safe to say that Infinite's plot by far interested me more than any film or book I've ever read. Not to mention, the backgrounds/graphics and the soundtrack are all godly. They all are good at establishing the atmosphere of the game, and even standalone they're amazing. The game is a masterpiece. Sure, maybe the gameplay may not be truely exceptional, but when every other category excels, the setting is extremely creative, and the gameplay isn't as flawed as the average AAA title, it is safe to say the game is a masterpiece. Also, on a subjective note, I still found the game fun as hell despite the design flaws and I'm sure you will too.  "

												(Completed on consoles)Even with my very high expectations there are things in the game that really shocked me. This game combines identity, guilt, belief, narrative, revolution, race, national identity into one of the most brilliant and remarkable creative feats I have experienced. Taking place in an alternate 1912, you play as a handsome Booker DeWitt wrecked with debt that can only be revived by rescuing a girl from Columbia. The world revolves around a floating city fashioned by Comstock who turn an ulternate America into a religion. Columbia ferrocious thrive for racial purity stems a discontent for violent change. With this brilliant metaphysical story takes the player in a journey best discovered at a slow pace. What is so extraordinary about Bioshock Infinite is how it highlights the human needs and the choices that we make as a person. Everything from its art direction to its narrative is numbing in its inventiveness. Bioshock Infinite is filled with extraordinary details in every moment manifesting from audio logs to level designs. To rush through Bioshock Infinite is to miss one of the greatest pleasures in video games. One of the most impressive accomplishments is its casts of character and especially Elizabeth's appearance throughout the game. The relationship that slowly involves and metamorphosize between you that is the central thrust in the story. The success is its sublime design and animations that turns Elizabth into the most striking character I've seen in any creative media. Elizabeth earned my affection and throughout the journey as I actually cared for her. Gameplay incorporates smooth and precise action sequences. Boss fights in mid sections change up the players vitality and it's all driven by an amazing sound score that raise these moments to extreme heights. The arial combat of the grabbling hook is fresh and a wonderous achievement as it keeps you in constant rush of adrenaline. It was impossible for me to say goodbye in the end. Bioshock Infinite will be the game of the century and will remembered for as long as I live. Just buy it and get lost in its masterfulness.☆☆☆☆☆ /5 stars			"

I know I'm 4 years late with a review of this game but I feel an urge to express my opinion about my favourite game, so here it is... The plot : Bioshock Infinite takes place on a floating utopia named Columbia (year 1912) where you play the role of Booker DeWit, a private investigator that recieved the job of finding a girl named Elizabeth and that way to erease his ""debt"".The beautiful city of  Columbia  is at the surface a perfect place with perfect people but exploring and advancing in it you will find its dark moldy face. The city is the representation of extreme nationalism and religious fanaticism at its finnest form: propaganda posters and papers,patriotic music,rigorous clothing and behavior and the glorification showed to Zachary Comstock aka ""The Prophet"".I'm not going to enter in the  story  trying to avoid any possible spoilers, but I must say it's the most outstanding storyline I have ever encountered in my life.  <You are going to cry after a scrappy rusted fu***ng bird.>  Advancing in the city and learning its hidden controversated history it's a delight. Finding out about Booker life and Elizabeth secrets and true self it's going to keep you bonded with them the whole game.It is the most mindf**k story I have seen in a game/movie/tv show/book untill now. You are gonna start questionig every little detail of the world and the story in the hope of understanding the game and find yourself in need to take some notes to not be overwhelmed by it. The story it's hard to comprehend, raising many questions and theories, but that is its beauty.Regarding the  graphics ,  level design ,  game/gunplay  its perfect: graphically it is beautiful having an amazing verge between the ""bright side"" of the supposedly perfect place and the dark side of the story/true city. The gameplay it's easy to learn, the gunplay its smooth and basic (being there a gun for every category: pistol, handcannon, sniper, automatic, semi-automatic weapon having the option to upgrade them at the vending machines). The new part comes with  the vigors  which make the gameplay more fun (having the options to possess,freeze,stun <etc> your enemies). And also you can find gear that enhance certain abilities.  The melee weapon  can be used to travel across the zipline network of the city, that way being able to observe the beautiful level design and kill some patriots, of course. Ultimately , this is not just a game for me, it's a masterpiece. Ken Levine and his team from Irrational Games did the best job with Infinite: the combination between breathtaking story, well established characters, outstanding graphic work and fluid gameplay is all I can demand from a game developing studio.10/10 I would play again and start questioning about the size and the possibilities of the universe, realising that my mortal life is nothing in the long run for this obscure,dark place we exist in. Ps. If you want more story,the answers for some questions and the link between Infinite and the first two games Burial at Sea Episode 1 and 2 is there for you.			"

												This game.Man, this game was an absolute blast to play through.Ever wanted a swashbuckling adventure, set in an alternate timeline of history, where you get to visit a magical city in the clouds?Ever wanted to have an awesome companion throw you tons of ammo while you mow down the hordes of goons that the villain has standing in your way?Ever wanted to connect personally with characters you were unsure about whether or not you'd connect with?Then this is the game for you.But in all seriousness, this game is very visually impressive, the sound design is excellent, and the gameplay and gunplay are much better than the previous BioShock games. Throw in a mind-bending ending that will keep you thinking about the possibilities of what it means for a while, coupled with DLC that gives definitive answers about the events before BioShock 1, and you have this helluva game.Also, I'd like to add that I feel like this is the best ""game"" of the BioShock series. 1 was more of a philosophical experience, and 2 was a somewhat weak game compared to the first. This is the most fun that I've had playing the entire trilogy, and I think that this game is perfect for those just looking for a great time.10/10			"

												Bioshock Infinite is essentially an overhyped hallway shooter. At first the atmosphere and city seem full of potential, but as you proceed through the game, all of it disappears and is replaced by mixed feelings of boredom and dread. This isn't because the enemies or environment are frightening or intimidating, but because playing the game quickly goes from 'a promising Bioshock sequel' to 'tedious mob-killing chore oh god let me finish this game already'. Progress in Infinite is akin to cutting through thick vegetation in the jungle while waist deep in giant python-infested waters, only without the danger, suspense, and adventure that would come with such an expedition.One would imagine that such a setting as a floating city would be an incredible feature on it's own, but alas, even the very world you play in falls flat on it's face and doesn't bother getting up, opting to roll awkwardly to it's destination instead. It is entirely forgettable that you're in a floating city once you begin to proceed through the game. Perhaps it's because rather than being able to explore the city and be reminded that you're miles in the sky, you end up just walking through one straightforward area filled with bullet sponges to the next. Where the Bioshock games allowed the player freedom of movement around whatever section of Rapture they were in, Bioshock Infinite instead holds the player's hand and leads them down one corridor to the next; the game's map design is basically a big, fat, straight line. Previously it would take some degree of exploration and attention to move onwards. Infinite, meanwhile, decides that it's done with all that non-linearity business, and makes sure there's an abundance of giant doors with comically oversized flashing locks on them so you know exactly which end of the hall goes to the next area. After you kill all the enemies there, get ready to fight more of them. Waves after waves of them, until the end of the game. Perhaps the worst part of all is that all of the main features that people were pumped for were instead revealed to be nothing like expected:Those cool sky-rails that seemed to have so much potential? Almost exclusively used to circle around whatever area you happen to be mowing down baddies in.Elizabeth having fun and dynamic interdimensional powers capable of smashing bad guys with items or having offensive and/or interesting combat use? They instead spawn in robots, skyhooks, cover, and guns/health/salts in a few predetermined places.Those giant handymen that seemed like they'd be fun replacements for Big Daddies? Get ready to fight two of them in the entire game.The giant bird that was anticipated so much and seemed like you'd have an amazing showdown with? You never fight it.Expecting a pit-in-your-stomach feeling as you plummet towards the earth after walking off an edge? You simply teleport back to where you stepped off.Having any choices in the game that could impact the ending or your overall power (like Big Daddies and harvesting/saving Little Sisters)? Don't expect anything even remotely similar, this game has no meaningful choices at all and has a hilariously stupid excuse for it (as well as the previously mentioned teleporting) that comes with the ending.What else do you expect from a game that Levine admitted they had to rewrite 6 months before release to accomodate the ending he came up with? It's hard to go into detail about some things (like the lame explanation for tonics existing) without spoiling the hastily assembled story, but all you need to know is that despite the mildly charming and well crafted environment (one of the few good things in this game), Infinite is a very poor successor to the Bioshock series, and an incredibly mediocre game overall.

												This is probably one (if not the best) game i have yet played, the story sucks you in. I played through it in 2 session on my first run. Well to be fair it does have some minor downsides, sometimes the graphics will look pretty bad, eg flat bushed or trees. And often youre just running from one combat to the next one. But there are so much more things that make the game so great. As already mentioned the insanely addictive story with a lot of twists and turns Even though the graphics are in some small cases pretty bad it is overall really nice to look at and the atmosphere makes you feel like youre really in a 20th century steampunk world (even though its lowkey steampunk ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ) Another positive thing is Elizabeth. You all know those NPCs that walk slow as hell and are more disturbing than they help you. Elizabeth is completely different, she is never in the way and has a matching walking/running speed like you. So no more waiting for her. Shes also kinda helpful in Battles since shes giving you free ammo/salts from time to time when your resources are low. Since most people might not buy the season pass I must say that you really should. Not only is it connecting Bioshock Infinite with Bioshock 1&2, but it is also giving you some more background info towards the story. And the Clash in the Clouds DLC is tbh kinda useless and mostly just for achievement farming ;)So all in all it is (with the Metro games) one of the best ones I have played to this date and I can only recommend you buying it PS: and since Im writing this (not only) for the Badge I can tell you that if I could Id put it in almost every single category, but as you can only choose 1, I choose ""woooaahh Duuuudeeee""			"

												[NO SPOILER] - 9.2*/10The game is just awesome in its own way. Its Unique, its beautiful, its fluent, and very narrative if you are focused on story and events happens throughout the game, just be patient when you play, and be focused- thats the most important thing, so that you wont be with a lost head at the ending. I love the mechanisms and gameplay. Apart from this, this game really uses your brain and your memory what you did in the game from the beginning. Elizabeth is a very beutifully crafted female characters i have ever seen in games (one of the best possibly). And Booker is a very good character as well, story flows very nicely and it does not make you bored at any place. The Hook Weapon and then death from above move is awesome, and using vigors simolatenously when you are shooting is a great combination. Elizabeth helps you mostly throught the game as a great companion by passing you health, ammo, currency and salts. And the best thing is you dont need to look after her, she always finds a safe place when you are in combat, my jaw was dropped after seing the ending, but yeah that was this game meant to be ""Bioshock Infnite"" ♥, i recommend this game.

												Having not played any of the prior versions of Bioshock I had no idea what the franchise was about or what to expect. I was disappointed at first because I was expecting the game to be more of an action / fps rather than an action adventure, and there is about two hours of ""story"" before any action happens. However I stuck with it and ended up really enjoying it. The visuals in this game are amazing alone, and masterfully done. There are some minor thing I would recommend users tweak that I found helped considerably.**The Good*** Amazing Visuals.* Deep and interesting story line* Good replay value, there is a lot to explore and search through out the BioShock infinite world.**Needs Improvment*** Visibility of enemies is very poor, I recommend either using SweetFX or turning up digital vibrance.* Player movments are very ""blocky"" with the stock configuration, I found out this was caused by ""autoaim"" being forced on. There is a config tweak to modify this:Browse to C:\Users\YOURUSERACCOUNTNAME\Documents\My Games\BioShock Infinite\XGame\ConfigOpen XUserOptions.ini with notepad or wordpadFind the line called ""bAimAssist=True"" and change it to ""bAimAssist=False	 **Overall Rating **9.5 / 10			"

												It's hard to talk about this game about giving too much away but don't matter what kind of player you are I feel you should play this game at least once and form your own opinion. It's probably overhyped but I wouldn't say it's overrated. I loved Infinite, it's one of the best crafted stories I've ever seen, that moved and confused me for days. It's not without flaws, I feel most of the gameplay systems don't quite fit the game but they're not awful, just inadequate. Other than that the game is just fantastic. The soundtrack is one of the most effective I've heard in quite a long time, the whole game is just beautiful, the duo of main characters is amazing and it has become one of my favorite games of all time. Play Bioshock Infinite, do yourself a favor.			"

												This game. This f*cking game.Well I finished BioShock Infinite a few minutes ago, and I'm still terrified about the game. It's just...okay, let's put it in topics. (Also pardon my english) Story: 10/10  A complete mindf*ck, that leaves you frightened from top to bottom and makes you want to hug your newborn child and cry in the corner. I honestly can't compliment the script enough. Loved the concept of American exceptionalism, perfectly executed. I won't talk much about the lore itself, since I recommend you to actually buy the game and have your own experience from a blank sight. Characters: 9.5/10  I actually managed to laugh with Booker DeWitt, who's extremely charismatic, and a bit of an assh*le. But the spark of the lightbulb here is Elizabeth. Oh boy, Elizabeth. You will fall in love with her, I assure you. She's one of the most charismatic characters I've ever encountered in a videogame. Elizabeth also helps you in-combat, providing Ammunition, Healthpacks and Salts. She can also unlock a few doors and throw you a random coin. It might sound silly, but you'll never get tired from seeing those animations. Speaking of combat... Combat: 8.5/10  I hope you don't hate me for this, but I've never truly been a fan of the usual ""BioShock combat style"". Yet, if you love it go ahead! The combat itself doesn't change much, but the addition of different guns and different Vigors can and will make you enjoy it. The Vigors are great, and the amount of combos you can do is huge. The enemies are also diversified, and some will even make you wet your pants and die a little on the inside. Adding ziplines, the help of Elizabeth (I'll avoid mentioning that much because of spoilers)  and a ♥♥♥♥ing bird  contributes to make the combat extremely fun. But then again, I'm not a huge fan of such combat. Map Design as a whole: 10/10  Simply astonishing. As an amateur Concept Designer, you wouldn't believe the amount of Screenshots I took. The artstyle is, as always, nice and smooth. I'm not gonna lie, I managed to get lost a few times, exploring stuff and finding random collectibles. I recommend you to...""enter"" the game, and feel the whole atmosphere. But oh boy the scenarios.... I mean, it's a f*cking city in the middle of the clouds, if you don't like that, you're weird, yo. Final note: 9.5/10  BioShock Infinite is one of the most well-written and well-executed games I've ever played so far, yet the Combat felt a bit boring for me. The game can be very challenging, specially on 1999 Mode (Don't ask). It's a must-have for players who aren't into BioShock that much, such as myself, and a treasure for BioShock fans. I know a few BioShock millenials didn't like Inifinite because ""it doesn't look like BioShock"", but come on, dudes.  "

												Bioshock Infinite delivers a compelling story and addresses issues, both sociological and philosophical, on a level entirely above most other games.  It somehow manages to tie the complex multiverse theory and quantum mechanics into an enthralling plot full of twists and turns, with engaging characters and a beautiful and immersive setting. Put simply, Bioshock Infinite is one of the best games I have played to date, and definitely one that I will play again – I just wish it was longer :/			"

												I can drop compliments to bioshock infinite all day long, but what really matters and is worth mentioning is that this game is addictive and will not let you go for a couple of days at best (couldn't stop thinking about it for about 3 days the first time I've beaten it) thanks to its' magnificent design, breathtaking environments, attention to details, charming characters and greatly though-out story that will blow out your mind. Bioshock Infinite is a prime example of how a first person shooter can excel in every aspect of a game structure(graphics, gameplay, story, sound, etc.). Definitely a game of the generation contender for its' unique ability to deliver in every possible way as I mentioned above. I rate it a stunning 10/10			"

												Bioshock Infinite is an amazing game. In this instalment, you play as Booker DeWitt, an ex-Pinkerton who travels to the floating city Columbia in search of a girl.Similar to the other Bioshock games, this is a single player story driven FPS. Along with the typical run and gun controls, you're given various powers along with a sky-hook which allows for fast paced rail platforming.The art direction and narrative are well done, however I don't think it quite lives up to first Bioshock as I personally preferred Rapture's atmosphere. The combat is a bit too easy as well.This game is still a must-play though, buy it if you haven't already.For a more indepth review, check out my video:

												Nothing more than a tarted up corridor shooter with pretensions to literary merit.  As a shooter it is weaker than other games in its genre.  As a sequel to Bioshock it is lacking in the features that distracted the player from the weak shooting.  As a successor to System Shock 2 it is a sad case of sophomore slump.  As a build atop the general concept of the immersive simulation it (and its predecessor by the same studio) are a total sell-out.  As a story it is an incoherent mess with no conceptual ground and unrelatable characters.  Its one redeeming trait is sumptuous, nay, brilliant visual design.  It is an utter feast from start to finish.  It's a shame that's all it is; vacantly pretty.			"

												Bioshock Infinite isn't a horrible game, it isn't anywhere close to being the worst I've ever played, but it highlights the unhealthy mindset game developers have today. This game has received so much praise that it physically pains me, because I know in the back of my mind people with no concept of consumerism are buying into this hype train wreck.Bioshock Infinite has repetitive gunplay with unsatisfying weapons that are better than their successors that appear later in the game when upgraded. It has horrible hostile A.I. that uses no form of logic other than aggressively running into the open and mindlessly attacking the player. There is also a lack of unique enemy types to freshen up the combat, and any uncommon enemy that is in the game can still be killed by simply shooting at them. No enemy types require any form of special strategy or apporach to defeat them, so the unique enemy types serve no purpose, and may as well be normal generic enemies. The vigors lack variety, and often just replace functions that mixed up the gameplay in previous installments of the series. Many of the combat vigors are simply grenades with fancy skins and a tripmine feature. Also the enemy A.I. hardly makes use of vigors, only the flame and crow enemies use any type of Vigor. Splicers in previous Bioshock titles used plasmids very often, and made enemy encounters more varied, plus with vigors taking the same role as plasmids, should they not be a commonly used tool among the citizens of Columbia? The tear feature is extremely under-utilized, and doesn't alter the game environment during combat nearly enough to really keep the experience fresh. So every fight narrows down to shooting at bullet sponge enemies and throwing vigor grenades. Escort missions have always been things players dread, but many games have achieved amazing escort mechanics such as Yoshi's Island, Resident Evil 4 and Ico. Instead of actually trying to be inventive, and making escort mechanics seem less of a chore, Irrational Games decided to remove the gameplay element of escorting Elizabeth from the equation entirely (either to pander to the feminists, or avoid the risk of adding something idiots may think is too hard). Elizabeth is unarmed the entire game in the middle of gunfights, there's no way she can, ""Take care of herself,"" without having a weapon or some line of defense. Despite the enemy's main objective to be capturing Elizabeth, they make no efforts to do so during combat. In Ico and Yoshi's Island, the goal of the enemy faction is to capture your partner, that's why preventing them from being captured is an element to the gameplay. Why is Elizabeth in the game? Answer: To pander to Tumblr psuedo feminists who want capable female characters instead of good gameplay, and neckbeards who want to be together with Elizabeth forever. Elizabeth is a useless friendly A.I. that doesn't aid but rather wastes the players time spawning ammo, health, money or other items (due to the previously mentioned bullet-sponge enemies draining you of your ammo, and the enemies dropping ammo for guns randomly, instead of based on the weapons you are currently using) and stripping control away from the player or clouding the screen with a button prompt to receive the item you could have simply picked up yourself, and in no way takes part in combat. While she can pick locks, there is no reason Booker himself couldn't have been given this abilty during development. Either way, you still have to command her to pick the locks, so you might as well be doing it yourself, her doing it for you also removes the possibility of having lockpicking being an aspect to Infinite's gameplay. The tear ability still requires you to command Elizabeth to utilize it, therefore the ability might as well be Booker's. If Elizabeth had an A.I. that utilized tears based on which would be more advantageous to you at any given time, this would have actually given Elizabeth a purpose in the game; too bad that would require work on Irrational Games's part.Infinite is also highly praised for its atmosphere, but I disagree with this claim.  Attention to detail on the player's part will immediately remove them from the environment they are meant to be immersed in. This game's visuals are praised to be groundbreaking, but only because they used the trite orange-blue contrast everywhere they could instead of the color brown. Level design clashes with the gameplay. Now, the first Bioshock was closterphobic, cramped, tightly packed, consisting of small arenas or hallways. This compliments the more simplistic, arcade-y FPS elements of the game, where you can avoid exposing yourself to many enemies, and reveal yourself to make a quick offensive. In Infinite you have a two weapon limit, so you can't pull out a sniper (you might not have one) and make an offense in the open, you have to approach your enemy, expose yourself, and be forced to take damage. Even the enemy design clashes here, where they'll run at you with melee weapons and be slaughtered by you in the wide open spaces. The melee weapons were useful in Rapture, where enemies could ambush you and get solid hits on you, here it's assanine.Most of this game's ""atmosphere"" should be credited to fancy skyboxes, and bloom. Whenever I started to take in the environment, something stupid would completely spoil everything. The biggest of all being the first person cutscenes, where the game makes you watch your character do things you didn't command him to do in first person view, the main display mode of the gameplay. When playing a platformer, cutscenes don't play from the stock camera angle, or else you'd be still be in the mindset of trying to control your character, and being surprised to find out that conrol of them has been stripped from you, immediately taking you out of the game.The same rule applies here, the first person view is reserved for the gameplay, so transitions from gameplay to cutscenes are less jarring. Another huge video game sin is where the game presents choices to you through button prompts. These decision making moments aren't presented in the gameplay's format, the gameplay is stopped so you can press a button and watch your decision unfold. One should be prompted to make a decision without being removed from the actual gameplay; the whole Half Life 2 ""pick up the can."" scenario is a perfect example where you are presented with choice without removing you from the gameplay. The setting of Infinite is nowhere near as compelling as Rapture, where you'd wander the deserted hallways and wonder what life was like before it all fell apart. Instead, Infinite seems to prefer shoving controversial issues like racism or patriotism in, and never actually do anything intellectual with the themes presented.The game's focus on narrative is problematic as well, simply because it takes importance over the game's gameplay; the most important part of any game. People seem to think writing has to be ""cerebral"" or ""deep"" to be good, but a simpler story that's charming, horrifying, campy, epic, joyful, or heart-breaking is just as, if not more compelling. Story is something that can be enjoyed on the side. Games shouldn't have to confrom to movies or literature, they are unique in that the player experiences them instead of watching or reading them; the events of the game are happening to you, so you are already invested in the adventure. Video games are about the actions you perform while playing them, the lessons you learn and the the emotions you have while perfoming them, and the sense of accomplishment you experience from overcoming the challenges the game made you face along the way. This game isn't worth your time or money, because it forgets the fact that video games are about the experience of playing them. Anyone willing to look at this game critically will know that buying it is a huge mistake, and a vote for games going further in the wrong direction.			"

												Love this game! Always been a bioshock fan, bought infinite a few years back and dove head first into it. This is one of the few games where a linear storyline doesn't bother me. The way the story is told, and the immersion are on point. This game was far ahead of its time and I'm fortunate to have played it when it was in its prime.The story is also incredibly deep, even more so if you have played the previous games in the series and then play the DLC. Do yourself a favor and don't spoil the ending if you haven't played it yet. Yes, you could watch a let's play, but you get so much more out of playing it yourself! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a quality single player experience!			"

												Very pretty game with an interesting story, and my praise ends there. This game oversimplifies the mechanics of the first two BioShock games, removing a lot of features entirely.  Vigors are a dumbed-down version of Plasmids that are not tangential to the plot of the game like Plasmids were to BioShock (though this is cheaply tied together in the last DLC).  Hacking is gone entirely.  Tonics have been replaced with a much smaller variety of equipable clothing.  Vending machines are horrendously expensive.  Skylines are pretty silly for methodically dispatching most enemies at ease.  The game also treats the player with an innovative and never-before-seen regenerating shield on top of their standard health bar.Does not have the same sense of wonder and discovery of the previous games, mostly because Infinite is, dare I say, a completely different genre from the other BioShock games - it's an action FPS, and as far as I am concerned, the only thing that makes it remotely similar to BioShock is a brief tie-in with Rapture, and ""BIOSHOCK:"" being in the title of the game.I'd recommend it for a $10 Steam sale, not much more than that.  The Burial at Sea DLC brings you back to Rapture in the most awful way possible - playing with the same terrible, console-treated mechanics that you had to deal with in the main campaign of Infinite.  UPDATE 3/25/14:  BoS Episode 2 does a little better in this regard, forcing the player to adopt a stealthier style of play unlike the running and gunning of Infinite and DLC 1.I honestly don't get the critical circlejerk about this game.  It is easily the least fun entry in the series.  For reference, I had played the first and second BioShock games within a period of 72 hours prior to playing Infinite.Update 3/25/14:  Burial at Sea Episode 2 fills a lot of holes and ties a lot of plotlines together, almost to the point where it feels like filling plotholes was the only reason this DLC was created.  Nevertheless, playing as Elizabeth is a lot more interesting than Booker's chapter of the Rapture DLC, and the storyline of the second episode is a lot more important than the first.  Considering that the second DLC offers a ""recap"" of Booker's DLC, only purchasing Episode 2 is entirely feasible.			"

												Just an excellent game. Takes about 10-20 hours to play and is a great offline game (why I don't have more hours into this). The story mixes with the actual game and makes a great combo the fighting is never boring due to the combination of guns and vigors (magic). The combat itself is hard and forgiving because of the fall back to a checkpoint style of death while at the same time keeping with the story which every part of this game does perfectly, there's no meta game moments which brings the world in a beautiful way to you, uninterrupted by gameplay. The game is fresh and unique while at the same time familiar and easy to grasp again.The story is that of the best I've played for a long time and without giving away spoilers its one you most likely won't get until the game tells you. It gives you the nice twist you (should) expect and it ties it off, yet in a way that allows for another game after this.=== Complaints: Choices don't matter in this game but they still make the world different and... well its related to the story. There are no puzzles like I expected... aside from The one in the very beginning regarding bells and that... that's a joke. Easy mode is... nothing normal is easy hard is normal and 1999 (konami code) is hard. by that I honestly mean that hard (normal) makes you use your skills and your guns or else, you can also make it through without any back tracking or grinding for money. Easy you could probably use your melee through the entire game. 1999, is the hard mode you expect, requires precision and sometimes may involve an actual use of vigor combinations along with just about anything else. Last is the vigors... they are great and each person has their own favorites, once you find yours you wont stray too far except in some situational use.=== Warnings/Spoiler free tips: If you fancy yourself a seasoned gamer I would recommend entering the konami code at the main menu (where you get an options menu) this will give you a tougher game mode and you don't have to repeat the game in hard / normal / easy. (although I will still play the game on the harder mode so that I can revisit and re analyze the game.) Pay attention. Collect the voice recorders to uncover the full story.Story: 10/10 (WoAh, watch out for that twist)Gameplay: 9/10 (FPS, not very exciting. +Vigors or else it would be 7)Presentation: 10/10 (Good style)Soundtrack: 7/10 (Non memorable, a few snipets of pop culture type of music)Replayability: 5/10 (If you do it will feel like a chore, or that you have been betrayed by the game.)

												Once again, I'm making a review of fairly old game that most players have played already or at least know about. Bioshock Infinite, as its predecessors, emphasize on story and great deal of magic of it artwork (calling it 'just a game' is real downgrading). Masterpiece with its own right in art and science fiction. I immediately fell love to it's colorful and everchanging world, great voice acting job and complex characters.I played this game to the end twice now, once when it came out and for second time when I got it here on steam. It brought me to the world of Bioshock where I even decent through the books now.+++ Story, plot twists and parallel universes++ Artwork+ Voice acting, audio logs+ Graphic+ Gameplay+ Two story DLC's worthy as proper expansions- Intensive and lovely experience but short10/10 “One man goes into the waters of baptism. A different man comes out, born again. But who is that man who lies submerged? Perhaps that swimmer is both sinner and saint until he is revealed onto the eyes of man.” – Zachary Hale Comstock "

Are you afraid of God, Booker?Short Answer: An absolute, no question, must have.Bioshock Infinite is the next installment of the already extremely successful Bioshock franchise and boy does it deliver.Without spoiling much of its amazing story here are the good points: Incredibly elaborate storytelling Beautiful graphics Clean and exciting combat flow Great voice acting, always on pointThe only bad feature? You can only hold 2 weapons, but let's be real here.I feel as though I can't go into more detail without ruining the experience, but you will play this game at least twice.Infinite brings to you one of the best gaming experiences you've ever had and you'll talk about it for years.

Product received for free
												I was gifted this game by a friend and it sat in my library for a few years. I didn't know much about Bioshock, but I just decided in my head I wouldn't like it. A couple of days ago, I just decided to load it up, and I can confidently say it's my favorite single player game of all time. Though some have criticized the gunplay, I found it very enjoyable, and the vigors were a blast. But, the world building and story is where this gem shines. With only having a vague understanding of the first Bioshock, I was able to follow the story without any confusion, well, except for the confusion the game wanted me to have.  Fully recommended.			"

The story makes no sense in the beginning and you'll be busy fighting waves of enemies but the further you go the messier the story gets. I promise you the ending will not only answer many questions but rise a lot of new ones. Totally worth the money! Maybe I'll play the DLC some day...			"

A lighthouse. A man. A city.Irrational's conclusion to the BioShock mythos was widely considered an instant classic upon release and rightly so. The game pays homage to the classics of the late 1990s such as System Shock 2; bringing the excellent design and relevant mechanics of such games to a mostly new audience and era. But unless you've been living under a rock for the past few years, you probably already know this and also have probably played it, so I'll skip the formalities and get right into it. Heads or tails?You are Booker DeWitt, a tortured, former Pinkerton agent, sent by his mysterious employers to the floating city of Columbia, a steampunk, pseudo-Christian dystopia to find the young woman Elizabeth, the city's mysterious idol and supposed heir of Father Comstock, the so-called Prophet and main antagonist. Your goal? To bring them the girl and wipe away the debt. In leading the beloved Lamb of Columbia astray however, your journey as The False Shepherd will take you beyond the blood-soaked city, the ruthless factions vying for control and morality itself as the two descend to where you may not want to go. ""We all make choices but in the end, our choices make us.""Drawing heavy influence from science fiction and philosophy, BioShock Infinite features a narrative unlike any other, proudly boasting complex themes and a well-written cast characters as the game ultimately plays out as a thought experiment, hinted at from the opening title and the plethora of voxophones, (the audio logs of Columbia), that can be collected. Though it is in the format of a first-person shooter, (with deeply satisfying and fluid gameplay to boot), the world of Infinite is rich and full of life and stands head-and-shoulders above the barrage of military shooters in recent years. The opening sequence is especially memorable and opening the doors to Columbia will certainly be remembered for the breathtaking moment that it is. What you will immediately notice upon playing is just how gorgeous Unreal Engine 3 is, even today. Though the occasional muddy texture would catch my eye or a slight pop-in, as a shameless cinephile, the colour palette really is the gaming equivalent of the Technicolor of classic cinema, i.e. that it is absolutely beautiful to look at.  Now, of course, it would be criminal if I didn't dedicate an entire section to the Sky-Hook. Already featuring the lore-appropriate return of the Plasmid-like Vigors, combat will quickly introduce you to the Sky-Line feature that links the quantum levitation of Columbia's buildings together through a suspended rail system, which you are free to use whenever you like, with a quick magnetised jump on or off. The manual executions with the Sky-Hook are bloody as hell and pretty damn satisfying in the heat of battle.Also complementing general gameplay is your excellent companion, Elizabeth, who might even surpass the likes of Alyx Vance as the greatest companion/sidekick in gaming. Along with her Tear abilities, Elizabeth will frequently collect and toss health kits, salts for your Vigors and money at Booker, repeatedly saving your life, especially on higher difficulties. Furthermore, she'll often have contextual comments or interact with the environment which are always really interesting to hear and I often found myself turning round and walking back to see what she was up to. That is, of course, after Booker was finished stuffing his face with hot dogs and coffee.Over all, you will certainly develop a bond with Elizabeth as Booker begins to find his redemption in her. She is a fascinating and likeable yet tragic character that ultimately feels like a friend to both you and Booker, which makes the ending that much more painful and the plot twists all the more meaningful. Make no mistake, Infinite will pull you into one of the most immersive shooters and mindblowing experiences gaming has even seen and will stay with you long after you've finished playing. In addition to the fairly long campaign, (which you'll undoubtedly go back to for multiple playthroughs even just to pick up on small hints that you missed), and collectibles galore, the DLC released features two sets of content. Clash in the Clouds is a rather enjoyable arcade-like challenge map mode in which you fight off various waves of enemies and complete challenges to progress. I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable it is and the mode also includes behind-the-scenes content that you can spend your earnings on to unlock. Far from gimmicky, it is actually quite good. The best addition, however, is the Burial at Sea episodic expansion which brings Booker and Elizabeth into Rapture and the events surrounding the fall of Ryan's underwater utopia in 1959.  The first episode is good, establishing the events of the DLC but it is the second episode where this truly shines, connecting both the original and Infinite in a remarkable and quite emotional experience, well worth the price of the Season Pass. As someone who has followed this franchise since the early days, all the way back to my beloved PS3, words cannot truly express just how great it is to be back in Rapture, realised in all it's true glory in Unreal Engine 3. The respect that Irrational has shown throughout to both the community and the world it has created is remarkable and, though now disbanded, they set a standard for games that all other studios should aspire to. That's not to say that Infinite and it's DLCs are not without flaws however. A divisive criticism since the first game is that the series is often too heavy with exposition and there are some notable plot points left unexplained. The checkpoint feature can be irritating at times, even with the well-executed respawn mechanic. The ability to only wield two weapons at a time can be a pain, especially in large battles and ammo is running low. Booker is no longer the silent, walking death machine that Jack was by the end of the first and 1999 Mode will be sure to remind you of that very quickly. But all of these pale in comparison to the game as a whole. After playing it through again and again, you'll find yourself simply not caring about the few negatives that are noticed. You'll be too busy invested in the top-notch sound design and immensely satisfying gameplay. It is important to note that if you have not played this before then you must avoid all spoilers, even with the third anniversary since release approaching. If you haven't played the first BioShock then I also highly recommend that you check it out. A walkthrough or wiki page does little justice.But I've been rambling on and off for the past few hours now so let's conclude.You'll often hear the words 'essential' or 'masterpiece' be thrown around in the midst of hype and enthusiasm, but BioShock Infinite is one of those rare feats that lives up to itself and achieves what can only be described as true greatness. At the time of writing this review, the entire series is on sale for an absolute steal, but even now it would be worth full price.  It isn't perfect but, in all honesty, when was the last time you played anything that was this good? A work of art and a triumph of gaming as a medium, this is one for gamers and non-gamers alike. Pick it up with the Season Pass as soon as possible.			"

												This is a game that desperately makes you want to think it's smart when it has no idea what it's talking about and knows jack about it's own subject matter. The combat is limiting and repetitive with a two weapon limit with an expensive as hell upgrade system. The ""Vigors"" (plasmids with a new coat of paint) all do the same thing with three exceptions: Possess machines for a short period of time (Not the same as hacking from Bioshock 1), charge at enemies with a strong melee attack (comes with a certain upgrade that makes it stupidly overpowered so you'll probably not use anything else), and an ability to catch and reflect bullets (would have been pretty cool if it wasn't given to you at practically the last part of the game), all other Vigors are just the same crowd control effect with a different look. The story doesn't save the game either. In the beginning it tries to send a message about racial equality and revolution but that's thrown away in favor of theories about alternate-dimensions/realities (which don't make any sense at all the second you start thinking about them). Also; why did they feel like they needed to have a twist ending in Infinite? Just because the first game had one? They also did it in Infinite's DLC. Are twist endings now a staple for this series? Do they understand how a twist ending is supposed to work? A twist only works if the audience isn't expecting it, just by making your series the ""Series with twist endings in them"" you're ruining the surprise because people will be expecting it. That's what made the twist in Bioshock work, the game gave everyone enough hints towards the twist without giving it away; no one was expecting it. In Infinite the twist is not hinted at at all, I played the game twice just to make sure I missed something but any actual hints towards the big reveal were extremely vague. It's only 12 hours long but many areas felt like unnecessary padding. The ending is 20 minutes long and it's whole purpose is to provide an explanation to many of the mysteries in the game, but it fails. Not only are many questions left unanswered, many more questions are raised. They try to explain most mysteries with alternate dimensions and quantum physics which ends up not making any sense.On a sunnier note, Columbia as a setting was pretty cool, but I honestly think this is the only thing the game truly has going for it.Wait a minute that card/10			"

												It’s no secret that BioShock was regarded as a pretty good game. On the whole it was solid but had some problems – mainly regarding a surplus of pipe puzzles, a few too many fetch quests and a really♥♥♥♥♥♥final boss. BioShock 2 traded those problems for better gameplay on the whole, but spent too much time protecting Little Sisters, and carried the narrative baggage of a million retcons. How convenient that everything that happened before BioShock 2 occured outside of the original.So if BioShock got the story right, and BioShock 2 fixed a lot of the gameplay problems, what happens if you mash them together?You get BioShock: InfiniteThe year is 1912, and you are surprisingly non-silent protaganist, Booker DeWitt. Ex-Pinkerton agent, with a gambling habit, drinking problem, and a lot of debts. When approached with an offer of 'Bring us the Girl, and wipe away the debt', you can't help but take it. At arriving at a Lighthouse, Booker decides to go up to the racist nutters rather than down to the rich nutters.Let’s not kid ourselves, Infinite looks incredible. Rapture’s main aesthetic came from the art-deco style and the murky underwater theme, and BioShock 2 took that and aged it by another decade or so. Ignoring the fact they’re older games, they relied on style and atmosphere more than fidelity of textures. Unfortunately it meant they occurred in identical corridors and big rooms with a few leaks. Infinite has amazing views of a city floating above the sky, and the feel is much different. 1 and 2 were horror games, and you’re being hunted and hounded at every corner. You crawled along dark corridors, scrounging for cakes and bullets, while jumping at shadows of Splicers or a Big Daddy. But in Infinite you can grind a Sky Rail, leap off and smack someone in the face, throw a murder of crows at his buddies, and gun down the survivors in one swift movement.You can only carry 2 weapons at a time, and I think there’s a bit less variety – where there was a multitude of Chemical Throwers, Crossbows, Spear Guns, Rivet Guns, there’s only a couple of weirder weapons, but I found I was using other weapons more often.I was most pleasantly surprised by Elizabeth. I was aware of her story significance, but I didn’t expect her to follow me around, and actually be useful. She scrounges for supplies, throws you ammo and Salts in combat, and you don’t need to protect her! I don’t think I could ask for a much better NPC follower! What were Plasmids are now Vigors, and EVE is now Salts. And there's some great quality of life changes - Vigors have a quick access wheel, and you can have 2 on demand to switch between, and the Salts bar is divided to show how many shots you have left. You can't carry First Aid kits or EVE Hypos like before, but you now have a rechargeable shield, and ther's a lot more items to restore your salts, and the Vigors cost less. Unlike 1 or 2, Vigors felt less useful. I don't think it would be better without them, but they weren't as pivitol in fights to the point I forgot to use them most of the time. Vigors are just kinda...there. Where they were instrumental to Rapture's downfall, Little Sisters and Big Daddies, and in combat, Vigors feel like they're here because they were in the last 2.Much like BioShock 1, I never felt in immediate danger, even when it began getting hectic. Your shield recharges when not being damaged. Salts and most ammo types were fairly common, except for a few of the more powerful or unique weapons. I had Elizabeth to throw salts, ammo and health if it got grim, and while I died a few times, it was never the end of the world, more a minor inconvenience.The final Boss is alright, but Comstock, the main villain, is much less compelling than Andrew Ryan, Frank Fontaine, or even Sofia Lamb. Ryan had some interesting ideas about who’s sweat belonged to who, but he was a pretty smart guy, and wouldn’t allow Comstock to be in charge, considering Comstock is basically racist Santa.BioShock: Infinite is the best story bits of BioShock, the better Gameplay elements of BioShock 2, and some quality-of-life changes. I think it’s the best of the bunch, but if you don’t agree, that’s fine. Not everyone can be right all the time.If I had a Silver Eagle for every time Booker said 'huh', I would buy Columbia.			"

												Don't consider this game as a Shock series game. Consider this game as a normal FPS instead of a RPG. And sadly the FPS part of this game is medicore and functional at best. Ultimately the game is filled with repetitive shooting for 10 hours before players get to the last 20 minutes of non-interactive ending, which does not reward the players in any ways what-so-ever. It is sad that a game with a wonderful soundtrack and fantastic visuals falls short when the gameplay is not entertaining in any particular ways.			"

												This is a very delayed review, and probably not going to interest anyone, so more for my own ego's sake than anything else. That being said, I'll remain spoiler free if you've wandered across this review somehow and haven't played it (you should, its excellent!). Bioshock Infinite takes us from the submerged, suffocating horror of Rapture to the strident, soaring world of Colombia, high above the clouds. The atmosphere and tone is very different, but atmosphere and tone is still very much present in this world. Bioshock is dragged out of the shadows and put into the light. It works, it's a captivating fantasy world which I really enjoyed with its own hooks, but on some level its not ""Bioshock"" as I immediately associate it with the claustrophobic, maniacal terrors of Rapture. That's not a bad thing courtesy of its magnificent storytelling. There's a good selection of powers and weapons to choose from with a variety of playstyles to select as you please. Having the DLC made the early game feel a little too forgiving however, as you receive a substantial volume of additional resources. The highest difficulty levels present a decent challenge, you have to be moderately conservative with your ammunition and vigors. At no point did I hit a brick wall in my achievement runs of the story, a test but beatable. There is also a challenge mode over several maps, and this is a challenge! Some of the wave missions are pretty demanding and precise, and if you mess them up, you have to start the entire map again and get back to that wave. Be prepared to invest some time if you get the completionist itch. The games strongest component is its storytelling. It's exceptional. Unlike the blank canvas of our Rapture denizens, Booker and Elizabeth are defined characters with distinct personalties, behaviours and voices. They interact heavily with the world around them, and most importantly with each other. There was a really poignant moment where I wandered into a room after a firefight, and found a guitar. Elizabeth began singing as Booker strummed. Spontaneous and incredibly touching. I normally skip such pseudo cutscenes if possible, but I found myself just sitting back and listening. That's good storytelling.They tangibly develop as characters over the course of the game, and you feels its earned and justified. Nothing is more rewarding as a player than when you yell YES! or WHAT! while playing, because you've developed a connection to the characters. There are also the classic Bioshock plot twists. Prepare to dive into the rabbit hole in this one, it gets pretty wild with some clever nods. I loved it. The game also possesses the most wonderfully bittersweet ending, which is worthy of a mention in itself. It makes your second playthrough almost as interesting as your first, as you look for the telltale signs of the set up. And oh boy is it a set up.So the question that rises: is it better than the original Bioshock? Well, in my opinion yes, but for a specific reason. As visceral as the atmosphere and plot twist of Rapture is, the strength of the narration and characterisation in Infinite carries it above it's previous entries, with twists to match those of the first game. It goes on my all time favourites list, and my 100% completion list. 'There's always a lighthouse, a man, a city'			"

												pros: interesting story and memerable charcaters- the most beatiful city and enviroment ive seen to date-skyhooks bring a sense of open world and fast pace combat-high emotions-elizabeth is the most helpful and fleshed out character and companion in a game so far. Garrus from mass effect and the other games a cool but their traits are only really shown through narrative. with elizabeth she has interesing things to say and does minor things that make her organic such as cough in smoke or around smokers and not go into the mens room with you or run ahead so it seems shes not following you and getting in the way( ""skyrim""cough). She also finds salts, health and ammo exactly when you need it.-Amazing voice acting-unqiue graphics-tons of underestimated vigors-MORE BIOSHOCK-gears add more varitey to combat with buffs like 75% chance to set enemies on fire with meleeCons-salts.Unlike in bioshock 1 and 2 you had stacks of eve hypo's which you could use in seconds and have up to 9 at once while not breaking the flow of combat. In infinte you cannot have stacks and your vigors( espically in the beginning) consume SO much salt. example. the second you run out you are restricted to your guns and have to often run from fights just to look around or wait for elizabeth to find some.This restricts you and ruines alot of potenial combat had.-guns are generic and uninteresing-no more visable upgrades on your guns like in bioshock 1 and 2-SO much lore is missing-enemys are bullet sponges near the end of the game-Irrational wanted to make columbia feel alive. but you cant talk to anyone unless they talk to you at scripted parts of the game.bad move-the ""steal"" mechanic is bad  as in when you first see the red letters in say a box in a bar in a back room with no one looking you think you can take it safely. the second you open it people start screaming and others attack you. pointless-WHERE ARE THE DAMN GEAR BOOTS-restricions. example: a nun in a airship will use a moltov to kill herself and destroy the airship your in. you know this. you open fire at her and guess what? divine intervention or some♥♥♥♥♥♥because the bullets go through her. The devoplers hold your hand at alot of parts in the game and the worst is you can tell.-you can only have 2 guns which really restricts combat variety unlie in 1 and 2 where you had 8 at once-combat more fps and not as fexiable as bioshock 1-guns lack kickVerdict 8/10Its a great game and i do recommend it and playing on hard as its a tough but staisfying modehowever you do need to pay a close attention to the dialouge as the story off the skyhooks.people need to look closer at the game and it doesnt deserve the 10/10 its been getting but does deserve every damn award it got at E3 as its a amazing game. you dont need to play the first 2 bioshock games to understand this one. however so much unseen potenial.

""Bring us the girl, and wipe away the debt""  - A sentence heard in-game which you will be remember for a lifetime. Several years after Bioshock, Irrational Games and 2KGames coming up with a new game Bioshock Infinite. Want to read more about check inside...Before I start, I just want to say a few words. First off, the game lasted around 16 hours, that's with completing the story from the start to the ending credits. Besides that, in my review, I'll post the cons after I've put up my review of that section.Story:""Indebted to the wrong people, with his life on the line, veteran of the U.S. Cavalry and now hired gun, Booker DeWitt has only one opportunity to wipe his slate clean. He must rescue Elizabeth, a mysterious girl imprisoned since childhood and locked up in the flying city of Columbia. Forced to trust one another, Booker and Elizabeth form a powerful bond during their daring escape. Together, they learn to harness an expanding arsenal of weapons and abilities, as they fight on zeppelins in the clouds, along high-speed Sky-Lines, and down in the streets of Columbia, all while surviving the threats of the air-city and uncovering its dark secret.""The story itself is amazing, you get so immersed into the game it's unbelievable, making it impossible to stay off the game. As you step through the story, you get a real feel for the game, you start to see how American history is referenced (I won't say too much more as I don't want to spoil it for anybody).So yes you are Booker DeWitt, and you have to rescue a girl called Elizabeth. You enter a floating city called Columbia, which is living a lot, everywhere people are walking around and interacting with each other. Most of the times they say something which add some twists to the story you follow. As soon you find out what's wrong you will fight alot of enemies and hope you can find an answer for all your questions.Throughout the game, there are two factions, The Vox Populi and The Founders:The Vox Populi (Latin for ""Voice of the People""), are a militant underground insurgency group led primarily by revolutionary Daisy Fitzroy. They are in open conflict with Zachary Hale Comstock and The Founders, rejecting their puritanical and xenophobic ideology.The Founders are a major citizen faction and political party in the city of Columbia. Their name relates to the fact that they see themselves as the true founders of the city, and they attempt to model their ideals after the founding fathers of the United States. The party promotes ultra-nationalism, religious faith in the divinity of Father Comstock, jingoism, Militarism and extreme xenophobia, and is currently engaged at war with the anarcho-communist resistance group known as the Vox Populi.Both have there own story, decisions and things they believe in. Throughout the game you will learn more about both of them. I can tell you it will makes an interesting experience to know each story.Pros:- This game story left a me with a mend-bend.. :).Cons:- None.Gameplay:The gameplay in this game is very similar to the first Bioshock. However, there are some differences, which should be noticed by the average player along with the veteran players of this franchise. I love it myself, so I definitely noticed!1. Gear: Ingame you can find and collect Gear parts. Each gear part has some stats which change some gameplay things like more damage or faster sprint and more like that.2. Vigors: Remember the plasmids from Bioshock 1? Well now they are called Vigors, they do exact the same but only difference is that you need Salt for it instead of Eve. But these Vigors are awesome, you can let people fly in the air so you can do more damage to them before they hit you, or you can make an enemy your ally to fight with you for a specific amount of time.2. Sky-Hook: This is a melee weapon and means of transportation throughout Columbia on its Sky-Lines. This thing can also be used as a melee weapon so you can hit you enemy with it or you can press a button so it insta-kill your enemy which result in flying enemies or burning ones (depends on the gear you wear).3. Elizabeth: After you rescued here, she will help  you during the fights. So she can give you ammo and health. Beside the fights she will randomly walk in the area where you are and might ask you sometimes if you need some money or she tells you that there are some lockpicks there. Yes lockpicks, Elizabeth has a great lockpicking level, but like always its hard choice to lockpick or not.4. Weapons: Booker DeWitt has alot of weapons but the only downside of this is that you can only hold 2 of them instead of all like in the first Bioshock. (For more information about all weapons can be found here: http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/BioShock_Infinite_Weapons ). Every weapon has it's own up and downside effects, like limited ammo, more damage or lot of recoil. You will experience this on your own while playing.Bonus: Once you completed the game you are able to play the game again in the 1999 mode, so how you played your games when you were younger. This mode makes the enemies harder to defeat, you have no map or direction help and you get less money. Beside that there is another way to achieve the 1999 mode but from start, all you have to do is enter the konami code and you are done :D.Cons:- I could say that 2 weapons is one of the ""cons"", only it doesn't make a difference to the game, but I'll still leave a note here.Graphics:Where should I start, the first time you enter Columbia you will be amazed of what you see. It's absolutely gorgeous, the visuals are beautiful. The light shines through the windows, it gleams around the buildings. Honestly, this game is a dream with it's graphics, they're fantastic.The graphics, atmosphere and the visuals are just outstanding, they are so perfect. I'm not sure what to say more about this part of the game. It's like you walk into a dream story, you feel so immersed into the gameplay it's crazy. Great visuals make for some great sounds, too..For the people which are wondering, i ran all settings on High. This is not the highest setting, but listen: I tried very high and ultra, and I must say I couldn't see any difference else then how the water visuals were different anything else was just the same.Cons:- Can use a better variation of NPC faces (they look mostly all the same :().Sound:Well, what can I say about the sound? The voices, the music, they're all amazing, and they add that extra pop to an already great game. The youtube video below is an example of the in-game music, but I suggest you play the game to get a feel for it.Personal:Rating: 9/10Recommendation:This is really one-of-a-kind game you should have played. The graphics, atmosphere, story, visuals and the sound makes this game a adventure you won't easily forget. It doesn't really matter if you didn't played the first 2 bioshock games but still it would make some clue more understandable.Personally this is the GOTY 2013 for me, let me know what you think... or at least get this game and try it for yourself.Note: Season Pass will hit soon, this should give us 3 new expansions for Bioshock Infinite which should be alternate stories. Ken Levine has stated that you don't need to finish the game in order to play the upcoming expansions. NOTE: Old review i wrote for a website. I know the season pass is already available so don't worry ;). "

												Bioshock, the spiritual successor of system shock is built upon a series based around thrills, horrifying moments and atmosphere. While the games suffered from balancing issues and some poor design choices, they are quality horror games. Bioshock infinite however has stepped away from its predecessors leaning towards a very tense and story driven experience. Anyone attempting to play this game for horror, will find it sparsely sprinkled throughout the game, and very mild mannered at best. Overall I find this to be a great path to tread. The presentation is impeccable. The visuals are amazing. From flying vehicles to the skyrails and islands you will explore, there's never a dull area. There has been so much thought put into what you see, that areas didn't feel the same as each other. Even the enemies look wonderfull, the vigor animations are a treat to watch. A word of warning however, prepare yourself for the execution animations. I feel they are out of place, and downright gory compared to the rest of the game. After executing my second soldier, I had to stop myself as it is just too visceral for my tastes. The characters are amazing as well. It's as if they've figured out how to make a sidekick in a video game feel alive. Elizabeth is no damsel in distress. She will always be interacting, speaking with you and exploring the world. It will never be about following you, getting in your way or being generally useless. I came to really enjoy her presence, and as the game progressed I really wanted a good ending for her. All of this with the story being the highlight of the game. It has been a long time since a story has not held my hand. That while giving you clues as to what's going on, it never directly shouts it at you through a megaphone as if you are a fool. It is intelligent, enjoyable and throughouly worthwhile. How it tells itself through character interaction, sights and sound just floored me. If at all possible avoid spoiling this game for yourself. With all the good things I have said about this game, I hope you are still reading, as I'm about to explain what brings this game down. That is the gameplay. Bioshock infinite has a problem and that is, it's a game. A game that does not blend itself well with its story counterpart. There is an intensity presented in the game for your characters. You feel that they want to escape. You understand the pressure and intensity that they are going through right up until you enter any of the games many shooting segments. To get to the point, the soldier A.I is downright braindead. They lack any reasoning skills and are generally bullet magnets, and sponges to boot. The worst part is that they are the main force you will fight for the entire game. Unique enemies will present challenges and intensity from time to time, but they are too sparse to make up for it. There will be segments of up to an hour of slogging through fodder just to get a brief respite. A moment where you feel and can empathize with your characters plight, as you will be forced to move, run and fight for your life. Then it will return to being a mundane slugfest. The reason this problem exists is that there are several flaws inherent to the games mechanics. The vigors are poorly balanced with some outshining the others. There is little reason for variance as many of the vigors are just functionally irrelevant. Why throw a grenade when you can stun, increase damage dealt, reveal from cover and never miss. The guns as well just don't match up to each other in power. I found myself clearing the entire game without reason to drop my guns in favour of others for any situation. Ammunition is plentiful, there are vendors sprinkled throughout the majority of the game causing me to never want to remove a weapon. Possibly if you could equip more than two there would be incentive to swap. Between the enemies, the poor gun/vigor design and the enemy variety the game gets a very dragged feeling. I very rarely felt the intensity that my characters felt. Immersion was weakened for me due to the weakness of gameplay. I feel that poor design choices and lack of A.I for regular enemies really holds the game back. It could have been much better than it is. But that does not stop me from recommending this game. Yes, the combat is pretty dull, yes enemies are bullet sponges. The story makes up for this, and it is really something you should experience for yourself. I hope more stories in games are this interesting, with characters that feel so... real.			"

Through a gorgeous display of vivid graphics and masterful storytelling, Booker DeWitt, the main protagonist, takes us down an emotional journey. A journey of corruption, racial discrimination, profiling, and rebellion, all issues that remain heavily prevalent to this day.---------------------------------------------------------GameplayWhile serving as a reminder of one's own morals and character, BioShock Infinite also brings to light issues that go far beyond oneself. Set in a fictional steampunk state, Colombia began its humble beginnings as a trophy to the world: a display of pride and a world fair floating high in the skies upon blimps. What started off as an innocent display of such pride, though, quickly turned into an image of hatred and brutality. Going against the wishes of the American government, Colombia became a vicious state operating against the very people it swore to serve.As DeWitt, you will join forces with Elizabeth, a young woman full of extraordinary powers - of  which and whom the story revolves around. Explore each character and their history, while also utilising their unique abilities. Work your way into the very heart of the problem and unhinge it at its very core. Take down an organisation that supports and condones racism, elitism, segregation, and other significant issues that silently tear down the strongest of people.---------------------------------------------------------GraphicsThrough a quick Google search, you will find a huge list of awards that BioShock Infinite has received. Many of these can be attributed to its stellar storytelling and fascinating approach of real world issues, but also for its graphics. This game simply delivers the whole package. Not only are the graphics vibrant and sharp, they are eye popping, hogging (in that you won't know where to look), and just... stunning. There is no other way to describe the wonder of the world that is BioShock Infinite.---------------------------------------------------------AudioAnother aspect of BioShock Infinite that helps bolster its already brimming trophy case is the soundtrack and effects. Not only has some of the original tracks received recognition, but the audio just works so seamlessly with their scenes. Nothing is out of place and detail in the sound has been very well taken care of.---------------------------------------------------------Pros+ TL;DR version: overall, a great FPS game+ Challenging to get all the achievements, yet only really requires a lot of time in order to do so+ Vast array of weapons that you can upgrade with skill points in order to ""evolve"" them to each situation+ Free game mode called ""1999"" which allows gamers to experience the difficulties of the game back in the day+ Audio and sound effects don't detract from the game; it is not annoying and definitely helps bring the game to life+ Various skill trees and characterisations make for interesting and unique gameplay (powers and dark magic, etc., that is)+ Great storytelling that is both engaging and exciting; it definitely makes you want to complete the game (and then some)+ The graphics are some of the best that I've seen for its day and age. Excellent job, Irrational Games and 2K Games+ The replayability value is, in my opinion, high. When you first complete the game, you will be left with an unsatisfied itch. Like most owners of this amazing title, I'm sure that you will pick up this game again just to relive it+ Characters are beautifully crafted in both design and complexity. Each of them have their own unique personalities and facial expressions that clash within the story, yet compliment it so well at the same time. In no other game will you find such developed and engaging characters as these. Every scene with them makes you crave to know about their history and background: why they are where they are. Ultimately, you want to get to know themNeutral± Pricey in that if you're a gamer who just likes to play through once, this game will be over too soon. If you play through multiple times just to immerse yourself more, then this is the game is definitely for you± Only one mode exists, and that is ""normal"". Those who are seeking more of a challenge, therefore, won't find it here. Likewise, the death system is not punishing enough and seems ""easy"" and unchallenging as compared to, say, BorderlandsCons- There is really only one issue that truly gets to me, and that is when Elizabeth glitches and gets in the way. It happens very rarely, but when it does, Elizabeth just decides to stop moving and it'll take every ounce of your being to not just waste all your bullets putting them in her face out of annoyance. As stated earlier, this is rare, so don't let it way to heavily on your decision of getting this game---------------------------------------------------------With the amount of issues that BioShock Infinite touches on (and isn't afraid to speak about), I'm surprised this game even exists. Despite all of its controversies, I believe that all gamer's should experience this game and try to understand the various lessons and meanings that it is trying to scream out. BioShock Infinite truly is the definition of a gaming masterpiece and I'm not surprised at all that it has been rated so postive by the community.With almost 53K recommendations, all I can say now is this... what are you waiting for?Overall9.5/10---------------------------------------------------------Like my review or have any questions? Then please consider joining my review group, the Sonny Report! I will keep it up to date with the games that I plan on reviewing and will also accept suggestions.			"

												Bioshock Infinite really sets a new high for first person shooters - fitting really, considering its set in Columbia, a floating metropolis above the clouds. With Infinite, original Bioshock developer Irrational has changed the game, they have not attempted to transport the gunplay and atmosphere of a city at the bottom of the sea to one that literally floats to the heavens, and while there are some call-backs to the first game and both are indeed first person shooters, Bioshock Infinite is a fresh experience once again delivered in a stunning original world whose first moments may just illicit the same awe we all got on our first view of the failed utopia of Rapture.Irrational Games is known as a genuine outlier to predictability. It creates worlds that gamers will want to explore, from the destroyed capitalist freedom that was crushed under its own economic weight (Bioshock) to the claustrophobic fear of an over-run starship (System Shock 2), and with Infinite, Irrational has developed Columbia, a promised land, where, once again, not everything is as it seems.Columbia feels very much like a place that at one point may have existed. It is the vision of a zealous ultra-nationalistic leader who sees himself as the prophet for a new era in American exceptionalism. With its own history, hierarchy, and propaganda filling the city's streets, children playing on sidewalks and the constant views to the clouds, Bioshock Infinite paints a very different picture and atmosphere to that of its predecessors, but this fantastical world feels alive and genuine - and one you'll happily delve into.The world painted by Infinite is all the more believable due to its amazing cast of characters, chief among these being Elizabeth, the character for whom the game's story is set in motion. As war veteran turned private inspector Booker DeWitt your objective is to infiltrate the city and kidnap the ""girl"" in order to ""wipe away the debt"". The first hour spent in his shoes gives only the barest hints of his mysterious character, and he is clearly not a virtuous man, though this isn't a weakness in the game's desire to coax you into his backstory.Booker's backstory and his character are filled out by Elizabeth, who early in the title you are able to break free from her captors before the city turns against you. She rarely leaves your side, even in a firefight, and while she's not one to grab a rifle and start blasting away, she will throw you ammo and health as needed, coin when it's safe, and even use her powers of manipulating time and space to allow for some truly fiendish and clever gameplay.Elizabeth is an amazing character, up there with Alex of Half Life 2 and Tali Zorah Nar'Rayya of Mass Effect. She is a companion you will truly grow to love over the course of the game. During idle moments, she may speak her thoughts about your recent actions or what she sees in the world. Elizabeth is a fully fleshed out character that few games ever truly aspire too, and Infinite is all the better for it. Her presence is a departure from the previous titles in which you travelled alone, and she greatly contributes to the game's emotional depth and your character's motivation.Her captor, the zealous antagonist Zachary Comstock, is a great villain in that he is seen as a prophet by his followers and is reprehensible in the eyes of the player. He has a level of evil that permeates the entire game, with his followers drawn to his stirring ideals and manipulation of the game’s events. Those you will be fighting throughout the game are somewhat more comical; George Washington Patriot robots, three metre tall human cyborg handymen, cops, security men and various citizens. There are many variations on these few enemies, though none feel as developed or as interesting as the various splicers from the previous Bioshock titles.Accepting that, Infinite’s Songbird feels only slightly more developed than the Big Sister character of Bioshock 2. Awe-inspiring and a little chilling at first sight, but whenever he shows up the game kicks into high-gear with some thrilling chase sequences. It’s a shame he doesn’t live up to his premise as Elizabeth’s keeper, though he does play a crucial role in how the story is set up.As with the original Bioshock, your shooting prowess is augmented by a power system, in this case, vigors, which can bolster your offence with electricity zaps or fireballs, among others. They each can be powered up with tonics found throughout the game, and they also have secondary fire capabilities, usually as traps for unsuspecting enemies. With one hand dedicated to firing at enemies and another for using various powers, there’s a wide variety to how any various encounter may play out. And in addition, Elizabeth can use her powers to bring extra guns, health packs, cover and turrets into the world, providing another layer of strategy to firefights.Bioshock Infinite’s story doesn’t end when you “get the girl” to “clear away the debt”, and much like the original Bioshock, doors are closed off to you to exit areas until you complete an objective in the current zone. This could feel infuriating, yet I was never angered to explore Columbia some more, and the story does take a few turns you might not expect. If you are expecting a mid-game twist like that in the original title you will be happy to hear that Infinite has one as well, and it’s a doozy. I know I didn’t expect it and it comes out of left field, though on careful replays there has been some build-up I overlooked. And at the satisfying conclusion of the title, some fifteen hours or so after start (it’s a little shorter than that, but I definitely lingered in some areas), you will definitely want to talk about what just transpired, like all good movies wish to accomplish.Before release, I had to question whether Irrational Games could hit the extremely high expectations of gamers again. Overall, I believe they have delivered. Infinite is a remarkable game that offers a distinct experience in a new signature world as every bit as satisfying as our first ventures into Rapture. Infinite is a brilliant shooter and stands out in a ‘me-too’ market, providing satisfying gunplay, some great characters and some amazing innovations in its world, atmosphere and storytelling. Highly recommended, and I suggest purchasing it, would you kindly?9.2/10			"

												This game is a masterpiece of art and also a masterpiece of science fiction. I played it back in 2013 when it just came out and i had a lot of complaints about the gameplay and combat but it was still my favorite game of the year for its amazing idea and story. Game is inspired from Early 20th century America and Quantum Mechanics. Its about how in a situation of different possibilities none of the possibility goes unrealized. Every possibility takes place in Multiverse. It will surely leave you a little dissatisfied in the end because of the same idea it follows as it does it in a dramatic way. But its a must play game for anybody who admire art and also love science fiction. "

												Bioshock Infinite is a delight of a game and a perfect addition to the trilogy, but it's nothing new or anything that hasn't be done before. That said, Infinite is a finitely good game and excels in every department of its classifications. It quite simply does that bit more other AAA titles don’t do by being innovative, clever and ultimately cool. The combination of art style and accelerated gun battles are both elevated on the shoulders of a fascinating story that keeps you playing onto the next chapter scene after scene is a testament to title. Keeping the player not only interested but keen to know more and seek a thrilling conclusion to the epic franchise. Get Bioshock on sale and experience arguably the best title of the 3 for a fraction of the price, a worthy game both on & off sale, however I recommend playing both 1 & 2 first if you did not already.

												BioShock Infinite has you play as Booker, on a quest to Columbia, a flying city in the sky.I don't want to go into the plot too much as it's very interesting to discover yourself. So, on to the review.Infinite was a great game. Very Bioshocky, very fun. It is not a 10/10 game. This is hype. I'm sorry, but it just is not. It's an incredibly well made game with interesting plot and game mechanics and twists, but I expected more out of the reviews provided. 8/10 on a realistic chart, even 9/10 at a stretch. But not 10. It has no ""flaws"", just some missed opportunities, a little bit of a lack of fleshing out the narrative fully. A recommendation from me most definitely. I completed the game in 14 hours, playing on Hard, completing 34/37 Sightseeing and 75/80 Voxophones (which is maybe 95% completion?).Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!Nilesy			"

												This game is pretty good. With an interesting storyline, an elaborated characters concept, awesome graphsims and a nice gameplay, this game can really distract you during hours. I got to say that the weapons choice is good-enough to make you specialize into your favorite game style. However, sometimes the ""fighting phases"" are not-so-pleasant like the Handymen or the ""Special-boss-that-I-will-not-say-the-name-because-I-don't-want-to-spoil-the-storyline-to-others-players"". Those bosses are the definition of rushing toward them and flee them at the same time. The difficulty is perfectly balanced on this game. OP Weapons and ways to fight against OP enemies.→ 89/100			"

												I am impressed. Impressed by The City in the Sky. After finishing Bioshock and Bioshock 2 I thought nothing can ever compete with the world of Rapture. But then I walked in the streets of Columbia for the first time and it was so peaceful, so beautiful, so incredibly atmospheric.""There's always a lighthouse. There's always a man. There's always a city.."" But still.. these two worlds are so different. In Rapture you were stuck in small rooms with very limited ways to escape. It had its own charm. Columbia is just the opposite. It has many big open areas with the possibility to move fast around by attaching sky-hooks to the city's main transport system Sky-Line.Bioshock Infinite story is, without doubt, one of the best ever made for a game. It tells you the story by showing you things. Do not expect any direct explanation. This part is on you to find out what just really happened.. To put all the pieces together and try to understand.. Fortunately some people already made their explanation and interpretation of this very complicated story and that helps players like me to understand a bit better. And of course it opens more question for discussions.I have to admit I liked the combat system in previous Bioshocks a bit more. The biggest issue I had was that Bioshock Infinite allowed me to carry only two weapons. Sometimes I felt like I was stuck with what I found around. Upgrading certain weapons didn't feel very satisfying in the end. I never used them as much as I would like to. I was very frequently unsure if I should pick up different weapons around or not, because you never know what will you be facing behind the next corner.Here comes another But. You can't save your progress in the game. You have to wait for autosave. I understand their intention but it can become a bit annoying when you have to stop playing and next time you can't simply continue from where you were before.I chose hard difficulty level and it was both, enjoyable and challenging. Despite some of my complaints the fights were still very decent.To be honest all the negative things I experienced were washed away by the impressive graphics and story. I took some time away from the game before writing this review. My mind was struck and paralyzed by the very emotional and confusing ending.The good feelings still persist. I must recommend this game and then I must continue with the DLCs :)			"

												What a game...GameplayThe gameplay in Bioshock Infinite is both creative, immersive and perfectly fluent. I was a bit skeptic about the skyline feature of the game at first, but it turned out to be greatly implemented with the game's world. Some say that the game is a bit repetitive; and I won't deny that at one point, I was wondering whether the enemy killing would ever end. But personally, it felt way less forced than most games I've played. When you encounter enemies, there's always a reason or an explanation. You won't get attacked by random enemies at random times for random reasons. For once, it actually follows the plot line.The game features a decently nice selection of weapons and upgrades, which is obviously, always a plus in any shooting game.WARNING: Slight spoiler ahead.The ""vigors"" add a really nice touch to keep the game from being boring, along with the ability to get Elizabeth to open ""tears"" to help you along the way, which really gives you the opportunity to try different tactics to fight enemies.Elizabeth will also sometimes throw you some supplies as you run out, so being out of ammo or ""salts"" during a gunfight is not very likely to happen, as long as you don't abuse Elizabeth's powers.The characters development is truly one of the strongest point of this game. Elizabeth and the Lutece twins are the most unforgettable characters in Bioshock Infinite in my opinion.StorylineAw yes, the best part of playing this game.The storyline in Bioshock Infinite truly sent me on a feels trip. I felt wonder, curiosity, happiness, denial, unbelief, and even a bit of sadness right through the whole game. Never at one moment, did I not stop thinking: ""Why?"" ""Who?"" ""How?""The game's world kept me entertained with all its great wonders, while still keeping me clinging to the plot line until the end.WARNING: Slight spoiler ahead.The ending is probably the most memorable one I have seen in any games. The only thing that was a bit of a downer about it, is the fact that they fling at you the whole explanation in a few minutes, triggering much confusion, and leaving you with a feeling of ""...what?""The ending is rather complicated, and I even went and read an article explaining the ending after finishing the game, to truly understand a few minor points I had missed through the story. I ended up thinking about the game for two days straight to finally put all the puzzle pieces together. Overall, it makes much more sense than I initially thought.WARNING: MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD!!! If you haven't played the game yet, DO NOT read beyond this point.I felt the story ended a bit abruptly. When I realized what was happening, that in order to break the cycle, the Booker from this universe HAD to die, I also realized that Booker DeWitt, along with Elizabeth, Comstock, and all of Columbia would no longer ever exist as they are. Without Comstock, Elizabeth would never have been who she is, and Columbia wouldn't have existed in this universe either. It felt as if after going all of what you did, all of this had been pointless, yet very necessary to break the cycle. The other versions of themselves would never know that without them, the cycle would have gone on and on. Booker and Elizabeth would now live, but in an entirely different world.The post-credits scene was interesting as well. We see Booker sitting in his office, hearing a baby and suddenly getting up and calling ""Anna"" and asking if it's her. Somehow, it seems that this version of Booker slightly remembers what his other version went through, thus he doesn't believe Anna to be there. We'll never know if this theory is true or false though, since the game ends there.Overall, the game was truly memorable in every way. I really enjoyed it. I wish most games would have such an immersive story as well.			"

												Bring us the girl, wipe away the debt.....BioShock Infinite is arguably one of the best games of the year. It is the third game in the BioShock franchise and you don't need to have played the first two to enjoy this one ^_^You play as Booker DeWitt, an ex-Pinkerton agent, who was instructed to bring a girl and wipe away his debt... join him as he unfolds the mystery that lies inside Columbia.       The story is the strongest point of the game. No doubt, it has one of the best stories ever.... rivaling novels and such. The game starts off very confusing, but explains everything as you go. Honestly, I had to pause the game multiple times just to take in what happened. I also had multiple ""Holy Sh*t"" moments because of the wonderfully executed story-telling and all it's unexpected twists and turns :) It's just beautiful..... gave me goosebumps :3       The visuals of the game is very colorful and bright but somehow very eerie and unsettling...... I love it :D Somehow it feels repetetive, but pretty nonetheless :3The AI of Elizabeth feels so alive, she isn't dull and she will keep herself occupied if she gets bored. The music just blends with the atmosphere so flawlessly that it feels natural e.g. a bad rendition of Nocturne will be playing in the slums of the city while a beautiful orchestral piece will play in the higher class. The stunning music and artwork of this game will transport you to the world of BioShock Infinite.      The gameplay is an FPS with RPG elements put into it. You wield a weapon in one hand and a Vigor in another, experiment with them all to find out what best suits your playing style ^^ At first, I thought fighting while using the Sky Lines would be confusing, but it surprisingly isn't :D You do have to familiarize yourself with the battleground as the combat in this game can get intense.Overall Experience: I love this game so much, it's the story and atmosphere that really got to me. It's a masterpiece and it deserves the praise it got. Although the game stutters at times, it's not enough to ruin the experience. I highly recommend this game ^_^ It's an experience that you shouldn't miss.....			"

-Quick Review-Bioshock Infinite is a first person shooter with an excellent story, fast paced game play, varying challenges, and dynamic character upgrades that help keep the game fresh and going. This game will easily make it on my favorite games list, and the leader in its genre. -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  Have you ever completed a game and can’t remember any of the characters names? I think this is a common problem we all have, and game designers try their hardest to make sure you remember their protagonist.In Bioshock Infinite you will never forget the names “Booker DeWitt”, “Elizabeth”, or “Father Comstock”. Why? You may ask; it’s because these characters are fascinating, you’re drawn into the spiraling story and floating city that is “Columbia”.I won’t give away any important plot details, just know that each time I thought I understood where the story was going, it was changed and reversed leaving me astonished and eager to learn what would happen next.Game Play: Unlike the past two Bioshock games, this game limits you to using two weapons and two Vigors (aka, your: Force Powers / Mana / Plasmids) . I preferred this mechanic because it simplified the controls and made you plan which devices suited your strategy.There are two other elements to talk about regarding game play: transportation, and clothes. In this game you get to use a special tool that lets you zip along rail lines, which I must admit still hasn’t gotten old for me. Instead of having gene tonics (DNA adjustments that gave you special abilities and strengths) you have clothes which do the same. Achievements: Bioshock Infinite has a total of 80 achievements, about half of these are earned in the main game, the rest are from DLC. Regarding the achievement types; they’re what you would expect, story achievements, killing enemies with certain guns, killing enemies certain styles, collecting all the voice recordings, find all the things, and beating the game on the hardest difficulty.Price: Bioshock Infinite is  $29.99. At the time I’m writing this review, I’ve put in 18.5 hours; on my first play through I played very thoroughly (I was only missing 1 voxiphone/Voice-recordings at the end *cries*) I think this is a fair price for the amount of time I spent playing, as always I suggest you purchase the game on sale or from a humble bundle. Conclusion: Many people have asked me to compare Bioshock 1, 2, and infinite. What I said is that they’re all extremely good games, but for infinite you don’t need to play the first and second game because it’s a completely different setting.Naturally the game feels more new, but that shouldn’t undermine the fact that the whole Bioshock series has raised the bar, and up to this point Bioshock infinite is the most worthy successor yet. One can only wonder what might be to come next?I’m Atratzu, and I highly recommend this game.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update April 10, 2015:Here's the URL to see my review for BioshockHere's the URL to see my review for Bioshock 2 "

 A refreshing take on the Bioshock franchise Title: Bioshock InfiniteGenre: Steampunk, FPS, StorydrivenDeveloper: Irrational gamesPublisher: 2K games The Story: You play as Booker Dewitt a man who got the job to bring a girl to certain people to get released from his debt. ''Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt' Its all a bit vague at the beginning but as the story progresses you will see what it was all about in the beginning. Next to all this, when you travel to the cloud city of colombia people recognize you as some sort of antichrist and they are all gunning for your head. On colombia there is racism and hatred going around plenty. You have to choose a side. You come across Elizabeth the girl you need to save early on in the game. But she is being held hostage in a tower guarded by a giant birdlike creature with the name Songbird. Well you can find the rest out for yourself. to keep it short. the story is good. A bit predictable but with enough twists to keep you guessing whats really happening till the end. Storywise this game has its plottwists but it is well voiceacted and carried out great so im not complaining.  Gameplay: This is a first person shooter. You can play trough the game in 10 hours or so if you ignore everything around you and go straight for the story. People like me take a bit longer because im trying to collect every damn thing there is to collect. (which I failed to do too lol). The gun handling is okay I guess but what stands out the most are the vigors. you can create traps and lure your enemy into them, you can lauch enemies into the air, push them away and set them on fire. It was fun finding good combinations with the vigors to devastate your enemies. The variety in weapons was not that great. You have  like 10-12 weapons in 2 different variations. But they basically do the same, the only thing that differs are the names. But I didn't mind that. I just chose the 2 weapons I enjoyed the most playing with. And kept those for the rest of my playtrough.Also there are a couple of enemy types you will encounter on your trip to Colombia. They offer enough variety in gameplay. You will have to adapt to the enemies that are thrown at you. The hardest gamemode was a more of a challange than the rest. It keeps you on the edge of your seat so to speak.*SPOILERWARNING* As it turns out her father Comstock locked Elizabeth up in that tower to contain her. Elzabeth is a gifted girl who can open 'tears' to other places and worlds. Prophet Comstock thinks you are the Antichrist. As it turns out you are actually Comstock but from another world or something.  Yeah its all kind of messed up in Colombia but it was a fun rollercoaster in the end. Conclusion & Final verdict Should you buy this game? IMO yes. if you love a entertaining story with enough twists and turns, some good gameplay and great voiceacting you will surely enjoy this game. Its not at all like the 2 other bioshock games. If you want that rapture thing back, well its not really here. You should get the 2 DLC packs for this game. Its a refreshing take on this franchise and after all I had a blast playing trough this game.  Its all I wanted and expected out of a game like this and therefore my final verdict for Bioshock Infinite is a great 9/10  Do I recommend this? If it wasnt clear for you yet, do yourself a favour and buy this already. Want more recommendations? Come see our reviews on our favorite upcoming games!

												Bioshock Infinite is a game by Irrational Studios and 2K Games which plays as a First Person Shooter with intwined game mechanics. Bioshock Infinite is easily my second favorite game of all time. From the breath taking artwork to the tear-jerking storyline there are few games that can compare to the masterpiece known as Infinite. The game itself plays unlike it's predecessors Bioshock and Bioshock 2: Sea of Dreams. Bioshock: Infinite takes place in an alternate dimension (as well as time) from the universe of Rapture, where the other two games were set. Infinite takes place in the city of Columbia primarily during the year 1912 (and other places/times as the story progresses). The game lasts 5-8 hours on average.Main Storyline:The main story follows the point of view of Booker DeWitt as he searches for the elusive Elizabeth Comstock. His goal is to bring her back to New York in order to pay off a debt he owes, accumulated through excessive gambling, Booker is an ex-soldier of the military which was heavily involved with war crimes during both the Boxer Rebellion and the Battle of Wounded Knee, His actions led him to feel remorse and soul-crushing guilt for the rest of his life. His one joy, his daughter Anna DeWitt, was lost when he was forced to sell her to help repay his debts. In the game he meets Elizabeth and together they discover the secrets of Columbia and take on the prophet, Zachary Hale Comstock.The game is told from Booker's POV. Most of the game he is accompanied by Elizabeth however it does not play like an escort mission. Elizabeth can fend for herself and supplies Booker with tears, ammo, money, salts and health. Booker can carry two weapons at a time (excluding the SkyHook he uses for melee) and is able to use all 8 vigors once they are found or purchased. Booker's shield is regenerated when not attacked for a set period of time however health can only be regenerated through items or vending machines. Salts fuel vigors as Eve fueled plasmids and salts can be found throughout the game.Clash in the Clouds:Clash in the Clouds is a wave by wave survival and elimination type of DLC that was added to the game. The DLC is non-canon to the main storyline however once one completes the Museum Curator achievement they will find an interesting reference to the Bioshock series. The Clash in the Clouds DLC contains four maps, each with 15 waves. The maps become increasingly difficult as the waves progress. The money system in Clash in the Clouds is untied to the main story and one may purchase museum items as well as upgrades for the DLC exclusively.Burial at Sea Ep. 1 (Spoilers):Burial at Sea Episode 1 is canon to the main storyline and yet at the same time is almost entirely detached. In Burial at Sea Episode 1 the player takes control of Booker once more however in this universe, the setting is in Pre-fall Rapture. Christmas Eve. The plot follows this version of Booker searching for a young girl named Sally who Booker seems to believe is like his daughter. An older and more mysterious Elizabeth (whom this Booker does not recognize) leads him out of Ryan's Rapture and into the ruins of Fontaine's Futuristics (hundreds of leagues below Rapture). In this ruin, Booker and Elizabeth search for Sally and eventually lure her out of the ducts she is hiding in. To this Booker's dismay, Sally is a little sister and she calls upon a Big Daddy to protect her. Booker defeats this Big Daddy but soon realizes that he is not who he believes. He witnesses a flashback to his past where he understands that he is in fact, Zachary Hale Comstock. This version of Comstock fled Columbia after cutting off Elizabeth's head in a struggle with the Booker he stole the baby Elizabeth from. The guilt drives him to Rapture where he restarts his life and forgets his past as Comstock. Once the older Elizabeth learns the truth she allows a second Big Daddy to murder him from behind.The game plays very similarily to the Bioshock Infinite main storyline and the player is introduced to two new vigors/plasmids (Old Man Winter which is similar to Winter Blast and Radar Range which microwaves enemies). The DLC itself is fairly short however it is more eerie and closer to the first Bioshock game in terms of atmosphere. Ambient noise and splicers make the game reminiscent of it's first predecessor. While short, the DLC is highly recommended and provides a rough 2-3 hours of enjoyable gameplay.Burial at Sea Ep. 2 (Spoilers):The second installment of the Burial at Sea DLC is far more storyline intensive and plays almost entirely differently from all the Bioshock games. Burial at Sea Ep. 2 differs in the fact that the player assumes control of Elizabeth (the one that enteres Rapture after the Elizabeth whom accompanies Comstock in the first part of the DLC). This Elizabeth is originally care free in France and is able to fully control her abilities. However, the guilt of allowing Sally to be taken to Rapture and turned into a little sister is enough to convince Elizabeth to find Sally in rapture. This Elizabeth arrives to find that the journey into a universe where one of her alternate selves is dead collapses her ability to create tears. Now entirely succeptible to the dangers of the world and unable to use tears to see the future, Elizabeth must rely on flashbacks and an imaginary Booker to save Sally.Elizabeth first discovers her alternate self, murdered by the second Big Daddy who arrived to finish off Comstock (see Burial at Sea Ep. 1 Notes). She then moves to strike a deal with Atlas (or Frank Fontaine) in exchange for Sally. Fontaine noting the worth of Little Sisters in Rapture, agrees to release Sally if Elizabeth can bring Fontaine Futuristics back up to Rapture. Elizabeth agrees and journeys alone (with the exception of her imaginary Booker) throughout Rapture to find a way to move Fontaine Futuristics. She winds up in Suchong's lab and strikes a deal with the scientist. She promises Suchong a hair strand (not knowing it is her alternate self's hair) that he desires in exchange for use of his machine which fabricates tears. Elizabeth travels to Columbia during the Vox rebellion where she realizes that the Luteces coerced Daisy Fitzroy into playing her role as the evil leader whom Elizabeth must murder to mature into a woman. She also learns of Songbird's imprinting process as she searches for the hair (after retrieving the Lutece particle which would rise Fontaine Futuristics to Rapture's level). She describes the process as ""The Lion with a thorn in it's paw"". Jeremiah Fink leaves Songbird in a near-death state with only Elizabeth around. After a young Elizabeth saves Songbird's life, it imprints on her thus beginning Elizabeth's estranged relationship with the creature. Suchong wishes to use Fink's plan in order to get the Big Daddy's to imprint on the Little Sisters whom they are designated to protect. When Elizabeth returns to Rapture she is confronted by Ryan whose forces she defeats. Elizabeth raises Fontaine's building to Rapture's level where he betrays her and begins his assault on Ryan after he knocks Elizabeth out. Two weeks later, Elizabeth comes to and sees Frank Fontaine on the losing end of the war. Desperate for a victory, he interrogates Elizabeth about the ""Ace in the Hole"". Eventually saved by a past memory, she barters for Sally and her own life once more and finds the ""Ace in the Hole"" in Suchongs lab. Expecting the betrayal, Fontaine kills Elizabeth with a wrench and as Elizabeth lays dying, she witnesses a future where Sally is saved by Jack. Elizabeth dies smiling with Sally by her side.The game is heavily stealth-based and provides 4-5 hours of gameplay. This DLC is HIGHLY recommended for all players. This DLC is more difficult than any other Bioshock game or DLC and the 1998 mode is more than a light challenge. Take the DLC slow and pay attention to various Easter Eggs related to the series's storyline.			"

												I have just finished this game about 10 minutes before this review was made. I must say I REGRET not playing this game when it first came out and only touch the game just now.People say the game is overrated but this is a game where you must play and finish to understand the beauty of the stroyline. The storyline and the lore is without doubt, imo, the greatest there is. The plot might seem complicated and hard to understand at first but when you continue to play and story is slowly being reveal, you would be stuck wanting to know more. It's like you're waiting for the next episode of a show or a movie just when things about to reach it's peak, you can't stop.The game's atmosphere really is enjoyable. The music, background and scene fit well in every scenario. Gameplay is unique from other FPS and I quite enjoy it. Some character in the game have me emotional involved. This game is a MUST have for every gamer as it is one of the best story telling WITH ACTION GAMEPLAY. The story itself would be on par with Telltales's games but there is more action for you to do. If you want to get the game, you'll be playing for the story but the gameplay itself is amazing.11/10, it's so good I bought Bioshock series pack for all my best friends.P.S It's not just a game, It's an experience  "

												Wow. Just wow. What a story.I just finished my first play through, and it truely impressed me. The story line on most games are a bit thin, but not in this title. The game mechanics are excellent, and places it right up with with the best shooters. The thing that puts it a cut above the others is its narrative, which, as is true of all geat works of science fiction, is well written, keeps you guessing, and gives you plenty of concepts and ideas to try to wrap your mind around.For those who don't care about a litterary tour de force with lots of brain food included, there's still plenty here to hold one's interest. Along the way one will find articles of clothing imbued with powers, vigors (essentially spells), and weapons. The weapons and vigors have upgrade paths, but upgrading costs money, and money is limited, so one must carefully pick and choose. It's next to impossible to get every upgrade in the game. To do so one must find every silver eagle in the game and never get killed, and have a little luck on top of it all.If you do not already have this game I strongly recommend getting it, for it is destined to become a classic, and perhaps a rare multi-generational one too.

												Wow what a game... where should i start?Story was absolutely pure gold and it was one of the best what i have ever played. Okay, i need to admit that ending was a little bit disappointing to me but it was fine for me at the end.Gameplay was pretty normal like in other shooter games. Shoot and run system with some magical skills and tactical defense system. But gameplay was made pretty nicely so it was awesome still to play. Weapons were fun and easy to play.Design and artwork is one of the best what i have seen in my gaming life. Style how the graphics were made was so detailed and floating islands with unique people and wonderful soundtrack nailed for me!Game had stuff to collect and they were challenging to find but it was always rewarding to find them.Graphics are stunning, so you cant play this with old school computer. I played with low end laptop with 1280x720 resolution with medium graphics... but it was still beautiful and awesome to play!Summary: Storybased game with good gameplay and stunning graphics, must buy to people who loves to play and watch good stories.8.5/10!

												BioShock Infinite is the third entry in the BioShock series, notably taking place outside of the underwater city of Rapture and heading to the skies to a flying city known as Columbia. Columbia is set in the early 1900s, and the sort of themes you'd expect with that time period come-up as well. The early innovative machine craze, racism, sexism, a city divided by the rich and the poor, among many other themes. While these themes are explored, unfortunately most feel like they become rather underutilized for the last third of the game as the main story sort of kicks in.We follow a man named Booker DeWitt, who's come to Columbia to wipe away the debt. He has to capture a girl named Elizabeth, who we quickly figure out is some kind of icon for the city. She is guarded in a very Statue of Liberty-type structure, and has a giant colossal bird guardian known as the Songbird. And upon her rescue, we quickly find out why she is so precious to this town... She has the ability to open up tears in reality, which break the rules of time and space and go into other time periods and alternate dimensions.BioShock Infinite is a weird game for me. I both loved it, and didn't at the same time. Maybe a more appropriate way to word this is that I loved parts of it, and other parts didn't quite do it for me. I feel the game was maybe plagued by having way too many ideas, that many of them end up feeling kind of underutilized. And meanwhile other elements feel like they get too much attention and focus.The game is insanely pretty and visually impressed me time and time again to the climax. It doesn't look particularly realistic, but has an artistic and colorful charm, with some fantastic lighting effects, that really bring the world of Columbia alive. This is backed by excellent attention to detail, there is a bunch of small things in the environments that really make the whole location feel believable, if not fantasy-esque. The setting really did it for me, while it's maybe not as well realized or atmospheric as the forefather city of Rapture, it has charms that may strike high with those with a love of early 1900s aesthetics, gardens, and steampunk charm. The characters are also well-designed and expressive.The music in the game is rather well done too. The soundtrack supports each scene, and audio is utilized well in the environment. A few songs one might recognize also creep their way into the game, with some spun into early 1900s versions of themselves. With classic-style renditions of Girls Just Want To Have Fun and Everybody Wants to Rule the World, who can complain?Voicing is also really well handled. While a few actors can be noted on who they are on the spot (such as our everyman voice of Booker, voiced by none other than Troy Baker, though I think most gamers who play the game will know), but they do good on delivery, emotion, and sounding natural.This game is probably too action-focused for it's own good, especially in the last third of the game. Up until that point, I did find the combat to be enjoyable, adrenaline-pumping, and well spaced out with other elements. But to the last third, combat becomes far more frequent and honestly overstayed its welcome. And this honestly is probably the single biggest sin the game commits, as it threatens to ruin the otherwise fantastic endgame the game provides, and may make many too frustrated or just bored of tedium to really enjoy the things around them.I feel BioShock Infinite is at its best when it's not composed of action corridors and shoot-out sequences. And there thankfully is a lot of that here too. There's a lot of things off the beaten path to indulge yourself in. Areas to explore for the sake of exploration, little side distraction, secret scenes you can trigger, things to interact with... I think I enjoyed the game most in downtime to explore the vibrant world of Columbia. It's an element one could skip over the entire game, but I honestly think they'd be robbing themselves of some of the best moments and enjoyable qualities that Infinite holds.And when BioShock Infinite is good, it's really good. If you happen to be a person who loves exploring, world-building, and just getting into the atmosphere of a game and taking everything in, Infinite has moments like this in spades, and the title may be worth experiencing alone for this purpose. It's littered with interesting sights, moments, and memorabilia. And the game isn't super short, it should take someone between 10-25 hours to complete it (the time varies so greatly because of all of this optional content one can either partake in or not, I personally was around the 22-hour mark).But then certain elements feel so underutilized it's honestly disappointing, or certain things feel like they could of been spaced out more. The Songbird's role becomes rather lackluster unfortunately and hardly lives up to the promise such a beast holds. Certain story threads are delved into, but still feel underutilized, especially as so many are dropped so easily, leading to a lot of themes and plot threads feeling non-conclusive, or really just there to be there. The rail segments, where you can hop and ride on rails, are interesting and appropriately adrenaline-fueled, but in the end are shifted over to hardly more than a distraction or a method to one-hit kill enemies. And then even possibilities the game brings up, both in narrative and mechanics, feels like they remain underutilized as well.And I think that's why the combat feels even more tedious towards the end. Because the game seems to want to deny itself delving into the really fantastical and instead rest on what we've seen a lot of in the last few years, a first-person shooter. It's not a bad first-person shooter, but it feels like it was too scared these other more interesting elements would bore some action-craving crowd and drags us back reluctantly to remind us that's the core game here.But I'd still say BioShock Infinite is worth experiencing. While unfortunately the whole is not as great as it could be, the sums of its parts hold absolute brilliance and are definitely worth experiencing. And the climax and finale, while what I expect many won't see coming, are deliciously... Well, that'd be telling.BioShock Infinite is pretty, backed with fantastic atmosphere, world-building, and more brilliant moments that most any other game could envy. But it's because of these moments the tedium of the game, especially as a first-person shooter, really stands out and starts to grate on the player. It's still worth experiencing though, even if it provides both the antidote to what's wrong with FPS in this day and age, and the poison.			"

												Infinite's world is mind-blowing. The graphics are excellent, the city, story, and enemies are creative, and Elizabeth is a great female character. It is incredibly fun to zip around on the cargo rails, watch different factions attack each other, fight off enemy airships, and just explore the city Irrational Games has created.Unfortunately, Infinite is plagued with repetition. For the majority of the game, you must basically kill everything that moves, loot, get ambushed or creep up to a new area of enemies, and repeat. In addition, the gameplay itself is repetitive; while the gunplay is great, there is a seriously limited selection of guns, and while some of the magic abilities are useful, most are virtually useless. The game will also make you fight the same bosses over and over, and you will find yourself saying ""Again?"" throughout. You may also find yourself becoming frustrated like I did during the graveyard scene (or other scenes), but I just turned the difficulty down to Easy and it was manageable.Thankfully, Elizabeth proves to be an awesome companion and really changes up what would otherwise be an average game. You can tell her to create a first-aid supply station during battle, direct her to spawn a aircraft to shoot missles at enemies, and even change the world completely. If it were not for her, it would be easy to lose interest in the game, but Elizabeth and her story were what motivated me to play to the end. Although it has some flaws, exploring the city with Elizabeth is an amazing experience, and so I think Infinite is above average and is worthy of your time.     "

			We finish what we started in this final episode of the Burial At Sea DLC for Bioshock Infinite! Check out our thoughts on what has come to be the final game from Irrational Games.		

Bioshock Infinite continues the series tradition of thrusting players into a dystopia lead by an meglomaniac guided by a specific philosophy or vision. Comstock, Infinite's equivalent to Andrew Ryan, is a religious zealot and Nationalist whose vision of an jingoistic, WASPy industrialized society suspended in the clouds away from the impurities of those treading upon soil is realized when a couple of brilliant physicsts deliver a technology that allows him to construct his city among the heavens dubbed Columbia. Comstock has his daughter, Elizabeth, held captive in a tower in Columbia, guarded by a large mechanical flying creature known as The Songbird. Elizabeth is no ordinary girl, she is giften with the ability to open tears in space time. Enter your character Booker DeWitt, a Private Eye who has fallen on hard times due to his alcohol and gambling problems. He is offered the chance to wipe away his debts and start fresh if he can rescue Elizabeth. Little does he know, his journey to rescue the girl and wipe away his debt will be one of self discovery as he confronts his past.Infinite, grafts the gameplay of the previous entries onto it's turn of the century setting, mixing gunplay with vigors (the same thing as plasmids) with various enemy types. While the game offers much in the way of variety with a dozen weapons and a handful of diverse vigors, it never forces players to use one over the other. It's a missed opportunity to introduce some much needed challenge to the gameplay as it's just as easy to blow gaping holes in emeies with the formidable firearms that make up the game's arsenal as it is to deplete your salts (the game's magic power) in order to execute your foes in a flashy manner. New to Columbia are sky rails that allow Booker to travel through the air, adding some verticality to the proceedings. high flying aerial duels can be thrilling at first but often you will fail to notice the rails overhead until after your foes have been slain. Combat is certainly not Infinite's strong suit despite the numerous options it provides.Where Infinite is nigh peerless is it's art direction and the way in which is delivers it's narrative. The world of Columbia looks as if colonial Annapolis or Philadelphia as been hoised into the air. The brick buildings and cobblestone streets create and idealic atmosphere that masks the darkness of racism and industrial exploitation that loom out of sight and out of mind of the bourgeoisie of Columbia. The city is bathed in the warmest orange glow and decorated in vibrant colors that make the game stand in start contrast to anything else on the market. Infinite is also littered with propaganda posters and almost every district and area has a story of it's own to tell--reflecting the lives and mindset of the denizens of Columbia. Stong visual motifs are also employed creating several powerful moments even when the game's narrative suffers from errors in logic. Bioshock Infinite offers one of the most beautiful and memorible worlds in gaming. The Burial at Sea DLC expands upon the links between Rapture and Columbia, offering a touch of fan service with a seriously fulfilling narrative. The first episode excels by retooling the combat a bit by limiting ammo supplies. It also delivers an incredible opening sequence that allows players to explore Rapture as never seen before. The second episode faulters a bit with an emphasis on stealth but both episodes offer the same stunning art direction and voice work from the core game. No expense was spare in bringing this DLC to life making it worthwhile and memorable.			"

												Bioshock Infinite has been in my game library since the Christmas sale i want to say maybe fall sale of 2013. Bought it as a combo pack with all three games.  Friend has been raving about the series for years to me. I play the first and am blown away by the story.  Start the second one and couldn't even get past an an hour into and am thinking total garbage.  So the third installment I put on hold for quite awhile.  Finally get a wild hair to sit down and play it.  It is a very graphical stunning game.  I'm a little at a lose on written this review because it's a good game possible a great one with one thing I'm not 100% sold on the story.  The story is good but it was completely rushed it starts out slow like the first one that's fine getting your bearings and the lay of the land.  But then you hit the action and it's done quicker then a plate of oreos' at a weight watchers meeting.    It leaves you wanting more or it does in my opinion.  A person could easily finish this game in ten hours just rushing it not exploring or all that jazz.  I would feel even more cheap, dirty, and used like a five dollar hooker if I had paid full price for the game.  I did not so the feeling passed pretty quickly think I picked up all three and the season pass for idk around $20.  The story itself is good but you wish it had a little more detail to it.  All in all a good game don't let this review discourage your from purchasing it.  And the ending linking up to the Bioshock original wasn't even needed.  Love how they did just not fundamental to the story.  I would rate this game a 7.5 maybe an 8 but more towards the 7.5 mark.   Graphics superbly done. Story I liked it but didn't love it.  All in all if your a fan of the first skip the second and purchase this one.  If your new to series doesn't matter the order you play them just skip the second and your golden.  This game should definitaly be on your wishlist at the very least.			"

												I was never a big fan of Bioshock, for whatever reason, I just couldn't get into it, but Bioshock Infinite changed all of that.The game is set in a mythical city in the sky and it is filled with many unexpected plot twists and amazing visuals, speaking of visuals, I should mention that the game looks drop dead gorgeous (that's a no-brainer right there), but it runs so damn smooth, admittedly, I don't have a amazing video card, and that usually locks me out of experiencing many games a lot of them in full glory, or at all, however, I was playing Infinite on medium and I was stunned, the visuals were so unexpectedly beatiful on medium and the game ran at a steady 45-60FPS the whole way through, the only time it tanked was at the end, where it dropped to around 17FPS due to explosions. But overall graphically I am very amazed.But games aren't about graphics, unless you're a naive 10 year old kid, so how's the gameplay? Well, it's great, a lot of combat situations felt really intense and fun, though I do recommend playing on a higher difficulty, since the game is pretty easy for most parts (and this is coming from a person who is not very good at FPS!), Elizabeth usually revived me if I didn't notice my health dropping, and ammo was plentiful, and so were the guns. But over all the game has a lot of hidden treasures to find, has optional objectives (not too many though, which is somewhat dissapointing), and Elizabeth can unlock doors and chests using lockpicks to get a bunch of good loot too!Now let's get to the best part - the story. Now the story is quite something, by the end I had my jaw dropped without even noticing, there are so many plot twists that just aren't expected, there's a lot of lore to find in the game that does tie the story up together, but it did leave me confused a bunch of times, in a good way, though. Elizabeth is an incredibely interesting character (and pretty good looking too, I should admit), and most of the story is based more or less about her, and her father Comstock, as well as a big (and bad) revolution of the Vox Populi, that are mainly of second class citizens of Columbia, the racist capital of the world.Overall, the game exceeded my expecatations, but what stuck out to me the most was the story, which left me wondering and speclating it long after I passed it.Seriously, give this game a go, it's a masterpiece.

												The scope and ambition of Bioshock: Infinite is in itself difficult to fully take in, but it’s in seeing this ambition conceptualized in such astounding fashion that causes it to become almost exhausting to try and appreciate the vast amount of layers laid in such an intricate pattern required to make it what it is.It’s the rarest of occasions where the incalculable expectations heaped upon it are not only met, but exceeded, in ways I wouldn’t have anticipated despite my own rabid hopes for what the game might be. It’s an experience that’s both familiar yet defiantly willing to take risks in its attempts to outdo its predecessors, firmly steeped in its own heritage but only so much as it can be used to further itself into something even more remarkable, constantly pushing itself to new heights despite the possible catastrophe that could result. And it pays off. What Irrational Games has achieved is unprecedented, deserving of commendation and once again resetting the bar that the original Bioshock did so many years ago. It’s truly something to behold.The setup to Infinite’s plot is likely the sole moment that can be easily explained, materializing with the words that have become so familiar by now but adopt a larger meaning in their greater narrative context: “bring us the girl, and wipe away the debt”. You are Booker Dewitt, a man on his last line of hope in removing himself out from under the hand of some very dangerous people.And this is where Infinite forgoes any semblance of simplicity or predictability, literally ascending into the floating city of Columbia and a far more complex, complicated narrative that all but demands repeated playthroughs to truly understand. Columbia is itself a fascinating world to explore, for reasons Rapture never was or could be. It’s a living, breathing city that unravels at a deliberately slow pace, dropping breadcrumbs for you every step of the way but never exposing itself enough to have you see the full picture and become disinterested.The city feels real, for as fantastical and impossible the existence of a floating city seems; a gorgeous, fully realized environment dripping in early American history and architecture that comes to life in an artistically arresting display of color and visual fidelity. The constant dissimilarity between the beautiful areas you explore and the horrifically grotesque violence that takes place within them creates a sort of twisted beauty that never wavers or deteriorates into mindless gore.In many ways Columbia exists almost to entirely contradict rapture. It's a city floating in the sky, brought up by a fiercely communal, religious figure head that seeks not to eradicate law and God but embrace the ideals of a warped version of Christianity created in his own image. You arrive here not after the dust has settled and the city has fallen, but at the cusp of a viscous civil war that is nearing its boiler point, waiting for you to drop the match and light the flames.In the wake of the many firefights and incredible scenes of destruction that litter the path to Infinite’s shocking finish, it was often the quiet moments that made me appreciate Columbia the most for giving me something Rapture never did. Without the constant fear of being attacked or an oppressive atmosphere weighing you down, Infinite is allowed to show its humanity. Seeing the city the full of life gives a sense of place on a level I've rarely witnessed. Kids running in the streets, venders attempting to sell you their wares; it all serves to establish this robust society before its descent into madness, something often lost in a medium seemingly obsessed with sterile, dystopian wastelands.At the center of this is Elizabeth, the girl previously referred to who immediately upon her introduction becomes far more than the mere bartering tool that you set out for. She’s a character without the flimsy mirage of personality drawn up to hide a lack of depth, or a throwaway damsel that only serves to burden you down. She’s a person; naive, curious, independent, and the one you come to rely on throughout the game almost more so than she does you.The relationship between her and Booker is the grounding force for a narrative that often feels as if it could spin wildly out of control at any moment, but stays firmly on course throughout every path it goes down, the culmination for which is only describable as utterly insane and brilliant.With all it attempts, there are certainly a handful of threads which never get the closure or development they deserve, most prominently that of the deeply rooted racism of Columbia and the rebel for of the Vox Populi that has sprung up as a result. It’s one of the most compelling subplots in the game, though unfortunately has little time to be expanded upon and is mostly a means to a very violent end. Ultimately it’s almost understandable, as there is hardly room for Infinite’s larger narrative to exist in, let alone as many subplots as it has also managed to fit in alongside it.Though the shooting in Bioshock has never been a problem (quite the opposite, it’s one of the most intelligent and mechanically sophisticated shooters ever made), Infinite is unquestionably smoother in every aspect. It’s a faster, tighter, streamlined game that smartly ejects portions of past games to allow space for its new mechanics to coexist. The core of combat is in many ways the same as it has always been, with mostly names being swapped to reflect the change in local, but otherwise preserving the strongest aspects of Bioshock’s combat while expanding upon them in intelligent ways that further the tactical depth of each encounter.The skyhook provides one of the biggest changes to the formula, allowing for a level of verticality the series has never had, as you zip along rails through huge levels which require you take note of the new speed with which you can traverse levels and the vantage points now accessible. It requires a complete rethinking of how fights are approached, and gives the player the tools to take on larger numbers of enemies that in turn are also granted access to these new tools, and make full use of them in their pursuit to take you down.Vigors, Infinite’s replacement for plasmids, offer the same superhuman element as before but now in a much more focused and deliberate manner. Different abilities can be combined into more effective weapons, from electrocuting a murder of crows, to creating exploding enemies by setting them ablaze and then charging into them. It’s a logical evolution of the series’s most unique mechanic, and that only grows further as you come to learn the various combos hidden in the already powerful abilities.The switch to only being able to carry two weapons at a time at first felt like a disadvantage, but effectively worked in making me pay more attention to my surroundings and be more active in choosing which weapons to use and where to find new ones. It ensured I was constantly moving and engaged in the combat, as different weapons were often noticeably more effective against different enemy types and I was rarely given the luxury of having them all nearby. Coupled with the smoother aiming and ability to sprint and aim down the sights fundamentally altered how I played, and by and large made for a more compelling experience.Bioshock: Infinite is a stunning achievement; bold, refined, innovative, and constantly stimulating. It’s a game that never falters in its vision, fearful of how easy it would be to have it all crumble upon the weight of its own aspirations, confident in its ability to deliver something awe-inspiring. There are few experiences more worth your time, and leave you with as much to think about.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

Bring us the girl, and wipe away the debt...Average for an FPS, but an excellent story lies in this game. You'll grown to care for Elizabeth, for Booker, and when you think you're going to make it, your world will get upside down with a brilliant twist, which will leave you to think at least for days. Must have, can't really say anything else about it, don't want to spoil this masterpiece.			"

												My parents gave me this game back in 2014.I played the intro, but didn't continue as I thought it was weird.Until a year later, I started playing the original Bioshock.I am in love with the Bioshock franchise. Such a beautiful setting with an amazingly written story.Characters are great.Music fits perfectly.Combat is awesome.Visuals...ahhh the visuals, I love it.This game in particular now.I loved Elizabeth's character so much. Her story is very interesting and really drags you with her as you want to know more.Booker did a great job on blowing my mind.And Comstock is an♥♥♥♥♥Robert and Rosalind Lutece made every piece of dialogue amazing. So sarcastic but still so interesting.A lot of the original Bioshock vibes back in this amazing piece of art.A must buy in my opinion!9.5/10 "

												Это лучшая игра, что я видел. Одна из немногих игр, которая расстроила тем, что закончилась. Я бы ещё поиграл и последил бы за развитием сюжета. Играл совсем не для того, чтобы пройти и открыть ачивки. Затянула интрига... Началось, как стимпанковая фантазия, а закончилось в теории множественных вселенных.Желающим приобщится скажу сразу - покупайте всё, что относится к франшизе Bioshock и начинайте играть с самого начала, с первой части, и не забудьте поиграть в DLC к последней. Это всё - одна история, которая начнется в первой игре и закончится в Burial at the sea part 2.			"

Long story short: Not as solid as a game as the other Bioshocks, but amazing at story-telling, even if it takes a bit too much from Half-Life 2's book. Excellent as a finisher for the trilogy's story.DISCLAIMER: I don't own the DLC for this title, so I can't give an opinion on it. I've heard the Burial At Sea episodes are really good though, possibly better than the main game. Check reviews for the season pass before you make your purchase.Bioshock Infinite was rated really highly for Game of the Year 2013. And rightly so, the game does an amazing job at wowing the player. The amazing visuals, spectacular voice acting, and brilliant underlying motifs and themes make this one of the most memorable games of the year. However, gameplay features have been stripped down from the original Bioshock, some for the better, but in general the gameplay has ended up being a glorified shooting gallery rather than the maze-like claustrophobia that is Rapture.Infinite takes place in Columbia, a city above the clouds, rich in detail as light floods the streets of moving buildings, vapour passes underneath, and zeppelins float by. The story goes like this (and I will keep this spoiler-free and brief): you play as Booker, a guy who is sent to capture a woman for someone else. That girl ends up being Elizabeth, who becomes your companion after about a quarter of the game. Her characterisation is great; she gives this sense of trapped freedom throughout the entire game. Certain scripted areas really bring out her personality a lot. In the meanwhile, the citizens of Columbia turn against you after discovering a mark of the False Prophet on your hand. This theme of religion is explored pretty well throughout the game as well.The story is told in a Half-Life 2 fashion: you move from locale to locale to progress the game, each place broken up by a ""cutscene"" like area where, while control isn't taken away from the player sometimes, you're contained in an area until the dialogue has finished. It's alright, even if the pace slows down a little bit too much. There's also hidden voice logs around in typical Bioshock fashion just to add a bit more lore to the world.The ironic part about Infinite is that, for a game that has risen from the ocean in terms of locale, it's also lost a lot of depth in gameplay. On surface-level, Booker can hold only two weapons, and can unleash any of his vigour powers (magic spells essentially) at any time in conjunction, such as shooting with a revolver and unleashing crows on enemies. Hacking is non-existent now, and has been pushed into a vigour of its own.Most of the enemies are gun-wielding humans, which means the combat is cover-based. The health accommodates for this by using an armour/health mechanic where armour is cheap but rechargeable, whereas health can only be restored with pickups, giving the player a bit of room for error (which is always nice) without being ridiculously forgiving. Some enemies, such as the Handyman are more tank-like enemies (like the Big Daddies from Bioshock 1), and involve a much different playstyle to take down. However, the gunplay doesn't entirely work in its favour: unlike the Big Daddies, you're more or so launched into arenas with the Handymen, so traps and clever planning cannot be used; a drop in depth.The combat itself is a bit more dynamic that other cover-based shooters, however. Elizabeth has the ability to pull in objects from alternate dimensions or time periods such as cover, grappling hooks, health packs, etc. It's neat the first few times, but it seems a bit too contextual as some areas lack these tears, and combat reverts to the standard peak and shoot strategy, rather than the dynamic cover-shifting that the developers tried to implement.Elizabeth also can sometimes find items throughout the game, which, again, feels contextual. A lot of the time, she'll give items when you need it, which makes her seem a lot more useful than she actually is. However, I think it's a mistep that Elizabeth will sometimes find money during gunfights, and think it's a good idea to hand over as bullets wizz past her head.Finally on combat, there's certain areas with skyhook rails, places where you can latch onto a rail and shoot along as you zoom down the line. The game makes it easy to hop on and off, and a couple of places in the game utilise this in a huge arena-like setting. Unfortunately, it makes gunplay a bit difficult, at least on PC, as you do not lock on to targets, making hitting them while moving a challenging endeavour. This is alleviated by the ability to crush enemies by landing on them, but it does make these sections seem a bit sporadic more than anything.Weapons and vigours can be upgraded throughout the game, and fortunately the amount of money given to you in the game is quite small, only allowing you to upgrade a fraction of the things you can upgrade. However, the fact that you can only wield two weapons means that you can decide on a favourite playstyle and run with that, utilising other weapons only when they're handed to you. The vigours also are not utilised as much as the predecessors (for example, the hacking vigour is used a lot less than I'd like it to be used (I think I used it about eight times in the game)). The biggest issue with Bioshock is that it's the third and final game in the series, yet a lot of its features seem a bit worse than the original titles. It's hard to discuss on its own just because I'm constantly reminded of what is missing, as opposed to what is there. However, the story is subjectively better than the previous titles: the land of Columbia is wonderous and well realised. It's also beautifully modelled and textured, and is a joy to look at.Bioshock Infinite is a very good story, but it's not as solid a game as its predecessors. I'd recommend grabbing the trilogy package if you're new to the series but like first-person shooter titles as, while it's worth playing, it's not as good as the original Bioshock. If you do own the previous games, this game is still worth your money.RATING: 2 UP, 1 DOWNMy up/down rating system tries to differentiate between games that are mediocre (less ups and downs total), and games that are interesting but flawed (more ups and downs totals). Ups relate to how much good a game has, and downs are how much bad a game has.[/table]  0 UPs 1 UPs 2 UPs 3 UPs   Not worth playing, skip it Alright, play it if you're into the genre Very good, play it if you're looking for something worth trying One to go down in history, a must have for everyone[/table]  0 DOWNs 1 DOWNs 2 DOWNs 3 DOWNs   Nothing detrimental in the game A few things wrong, but doesn't ruin it Kind-of broken or aggravating, you may not be able to put up with it Very, very broken, a lesson on what not to do "

												The highly acclaimed Bioshock Infinite takes place in the sky town of spingleton, where the bad man Cornstarch wants to take the lady-lamb young Queen Elizabeth from your fingertips. The interesting thing about The Queen is she cries a lot and makes lots of tears that make black-and-white things appear like in the olden days. This is used as a very unique mechanic in battles to overcome Cornstarch's, Slater's and Mr. Vox Populi's men. Additionally, the town of spingleton has many sky train tracks that Booker can latch on an take The Queen on a sightseeing journey whilst being shot at. The enemies also vary quite a significant amount, from the fireman who ironically throws fire and explodes to the handyman who has hands.The special powers in this game, also knows as nigors, are as diverse as the number 8 and offer a great variation of gameplay. For example:In one instance you may step back and press the button for you nigor to fire birds at the enemies to finish them off, or perhaps you may choose a different route and stay back and press the button for your nigor to throw a fireball at the enemy, or maybe you might choose instead to stay back and press the button for your nigor to use the lightning on your enemy and give them a shock (get it?), or you might diverge and choose to stay back and use the nigor that throws a ball of energy at them or even choose to stay back and make horse sounds as they decide to float. The list goes on...The story of Bioshock is even more depthy, as the man Cornstarch and the relationship between him and The Queen becomes more evident. Trigger warning: Spooky ghosts are in this game. "

												I haven't played any of the earlier BioShock games, so I will not include them in this review. (Except here) BioShock Infinite is a visually stunning game with a story so immersive that the ending might leave your jaw dropped! The game tells us the story about Booker Dewitt a man who is out to find and kidnap/rescue Elizabeth, a young girl who lives in the flying city of Columbia, a what at first looks like a idyllic paradise with no problems at all.This however turns out to be quite wrong, like all societys even Columbia have its problems, racism, class struggle, poverty and much more, this turns the kidnap/rescue mission into a trip through a failing society. A society that is eventually flipped into a bloody civil war. I won't go in to much more about the plot, because I want to spoil as little as possible. But the gameplay is quite FPS generic, you get some weapons, you shoot some guys, but you also have your ""special powers"" Throughout Columbia you find bottles, you can drink these bottles and with them come great power, power to kill. These powers make all battles a bit more interesting, and there is also a hook which via ""cables"" in the sky you can travel quite fast around the battle areas, surprising your enemy from above. I would say what makes this game is the story, and especially the ending, however the gameplay isn't bad but it isn't great either. I would recommend this game!			"

												To everyone opting to play Bioshock Infinite: I strongly recommend playing the Bioshock 1 before even starting Bioshock Infinite.Regarding Bioshock Infinte (without spoilers): I recommend this game - it's a totally awesome experience, very atmospheric, featuring unique gameplay ideas, very believable characters, strong and mind blowing plot and beautiful visual design. Bioshock Infinite is one of the best action games of the last years. Rating it 10/10.But, at the same time it's a sad game. A drama. A tragedy. You might ask - what makes the game so damn tragic? The answer is - the Bioshock Infinite DLCs ""Burial at Sea"".Having played Bioshock series in the right order (Bioshock 1 - Bioshock 2 - Bioshock Infinite), I enjoyed the whole series immensly.  The  Bishock Infinite DLCs complete the story of the series, but  the story arc unfolds in such way,  that now I wish only to forget what I saw while playing ""Burial at Sea"", and even the whole Bioshock Series is now a one whole drama to me. Some secrets better be left untold, some parts of the story better be buried and never known. You will not find hope here. You'll not find your dreams here. It's like watching ""The Bridge to Terabithia"" again.I have never played such a depressing game in my whole life -_-			"

												BioShock Infinite it's the third game in the BioShock series released in 2013 by 2k Games and it was made by Irrational Games studio. The first thing that everyone knows about this game it's the hype. And I must say something about this hype: believe it.BioShock Infinite offers a great gaming experience, with a thrilling story, nice gameplay and beautiful graphics, it also has some DLCs that you MUST take a shot. It's story it's probably the brightest spot of the game and you need to pay attention at everything to get the hang of it. After playing a hour or two I felt myself really connected to the game, like a movie but in a movie that you're actually in it (If you're actually an actor it's still a great experience).It's recommended to play the first two games, excellent games btw, the stories are not actually connected but several elements and references from the older games are found in this one.In terms of gameplay it is easier than BioShock cause in this one you have a lot of money and ammo and in the others games those things are rarity.I really recommend this game to anyone that likes a great and well made story and a nice fps gameplay too.

												Stunning Game! Blowed my mind!Bioshock Infinite takes the gaming to a whole new level of design, taking you back to the mid 20th century, with a bit of Tainted Love and other musical sounds of the times! Even though it doesn't look anything like the city at the bottom of the ocean (Rapture), it has a lot to do with it, not only through the design of things but also through the storyline! And with the exceptional turn of events, it blows your mind completly and at the same time amaze you.This also may prove a point about many things in, at least, our reality! How many are there really?It gives life to that one theory from one of the brightest minds in the planet. Stephen Hawking.This game is very unique, not by it's design and gameplay but also it's storyline. It is so refined with theories besides the main one.Now I'm being honest about this review. This is basically one of my favorite games of all time. It might not have the most sensational gameplay when fighting people, but it still is what I payed for.Damn it is even more than I was expecting honestly.And I wouldn't be writing this review if it wasn't true. Trust meI've been a Bioshock fan since the first came out. Yea, the game of it's year.But when the second bioshock came out, it teared a bit of my heart. It was really poor from my perspective, not what I wanted to see ( apart from seeing a big daddy's perspective ).I can say I got revived by Infinite, and it was, for sure, one of the best games I have ever played.So if you are considering buying this game, you are a fan of Bioshock 1 but you are still not sure because the second one was a BIG disapointment, seriously: buy it. Worth even more than it's current price. Also buy the season pass. Besides saving $, you get 2 dlcs that twist your mind even more. And that is also where you go insane.			"

It has superb voice acting, a brilliant script, gorgeous graphics-style and a high level of replayability. While the game suffers from somewhat repetetive combat, it's still simply an amazing game. You will fall in love with this game from the first second you play it. The very first thing you hear in this game will hook you. If you are like me, appreciating the story most of all, put the game on easy and let it tell you it's story. The game is a true gem. Are you one who enjoys a challenge though, put it in 1999 mode and make Dark Souls seem like farmville. Was my favorite game from it's release upon the release of TW3.			"

												Infinite is more than a new setting, story, and characters; those elements are seamlessly integrated with complex themes, a mysterious plot, and entertaining combat to create an amazing experience from beginning to end. Familiar threads run through it – a lighthouse, a strange city, a charismatic antagonist – but they are homages to the past rather than attempts to recycle it. The core of Infinite is unlike anything else on land, sea, or air.Damn I love bioshock infinite. I love the artwork, the colors, the scenery, the atmosphere, and the story. I felt as if I was actually in the world of bioshock. Lovely game, lovely song!﻿Once I saw the ending, I just sat at my desk for 10 minutes with a blank face.

												I really can't get enough of this game! I mean, not only is it beautiful, but the story is so well written. You play as Booker ""Marty"" DeWitt, who travels through time (and space? I was never clear on this) to make sure his parents still hook up at the Enchantment Under the Sea dance. Instead, you actually end up on a super racist airplane named Columbia with lots of two dimensional characters with muddy motives and the illusion of choice. Oh! And there's also something called the skyhook (its basically a rollercoaster, which I thought was a neat homage to Roller Coaster Tycoon, which was also developed and published by the same company as this game).Mostly though, you want this game for the music. Like, they have Tears for Fears and Cyndi Lauper and its really good. Just jam out to some sweet tunes and occassionally shoot racists in the face.that's not how quantum mechanics works, you idiots/10			"

												What an amazing game! The storyline was the most amazing and shocking I have ever seen. The graphics are great but the best about this game is the mind-blowing story and ending! Elizabeth took me on a ride of emotionals and astonishment!After years, I played this game and its sweet DLCs again. I see the main story as my one and only canon.But the side dlc ""conclusion""-story is also very interisting made. I wish I could see more of the DeWitts. This game is the most tragic and bitter-sweet father-daughter-adventure, ever!Bird or cage - Forever and ever!			"

												BioShock Infinite weaves a complicated and intricate plot around ever-changing variables. Not only is it an evolving story that sees protagonist Booker DeWitt and the mysterious Elizabeth grow closer, but Irrational's latest deals with the hubris of a society built above the clouds, its ideals inflated with so much of the same hot air that propels it above the world below.Though it touches on topics revolving around racism, religion, rebellion and revenge, these themes take a backseat to BioShock Infinite's primary topic: Love. Whether it be a society in love with its own patented brand of American Exceptionalism, a leader in love with his own self-appointed immortal image, or a pair of people that come together to care for one another, BioShock Infinite is a love story.And it's an easy story to fall in love with. Taking place in 1912, BioShock Infinite follows Booker DeWitt, a man with a mysterious past charged with ascending to the once-iconic but now forgotten city of Columbia, a floating city in the sky. Once there, DeWitt must find a woman named Elizabeth and bring her to New York to wipe away his debt. DeWitt, who first appears to be without a vestige of sympathy for the plight of the woman, complies. To describe details any further would only serve to eradicate BioShock Infinite's exceptional ability to surprise.Unlike the undersea city of Rapture – the setting of Irrational's critical and commercial smash BioShock – Columbia is a living world. Players won't draw blood from enemies for quite some time when they arrive in Columbia, a world established and ruled by a figure known as Father Zachary Comstock. Rather, DeWitt and the player are introduced to the technology and ideals that power the city as they move across its interlocking sections; and as gorgeous as the world of Columbia is, it's a horribly grotesque place. DeWitt learns that the city is fueled by racism, misplaced loyalty and morbid patriotism, and it quickly becomes a joy to know the game will eventually allow him to pull it down from the sky, arrogant brick by brick.When players first arrive on Columbia by way of being rocketed into the sky, the focus is a civil war between the ""White Power"" fanatics led by Comstock and a rebellious group dubbed the Vox Populi led by a strong black woman named Daisy Fitzroy. While this story weaves in and out of the overarching narrative, it eventually takes a backseat to more pressing matters: Elizabeth and DeWitt's search for the truth about their existence on Columbia.BioShock Infinite's core gameplay mimics that of Irrational's previous effort: a first-person shooter with a magical component. The ""magic"" in Infinite is composed of collectible vigors, potent elixirs that grant DeWitt special powers, like the ability to electrocute enemies or lob fireballs. Each of the vigors, and all weapons, can be upgraded to increase their power and properties – longer ability duration, extra ammunition, etc. Where things begin to diverge for Infinite versus the original BioShock is in collectible gear, which can be mixed and matched to grant special buffs, like headgear that allows DeWitt to leach health for successfully performing brutal melee execution kills with his skyline hook.The hook is used to traverse Columbia's skylines, a network of massive, suspended mechanical rails that connect different parts of the city. While both DeWitt and Elizabeth can use them to travel the city, they serve as more than just a simple means of transportation. As the game progresses, the pair will encounter arenas with varying levels of terrain with enemies attacking on all sides. Though you can pick each aggressor off from a static cover point, it's far more fulfilling to zip around on skylines and fight from multiple angles.Elizabeth provides DeWitt with valuable resources like ammunition, health packs and salts during battle. Beyond scavenging, Elizabeth can also modify the properties of the battlefield by playing with pre-determined ""tears"" – splits in the fabric of time she has the ability to open. These can introduce things like cover, turrets, and even motorized allies to help DeWitt come out on top.Tears also play a crucial role in the narrative. Elizabeth has been able to open them since early childhood, though as a young adult she's lost some of her grip on her ability. DeWitt, understandably, is terrified of Elizabeth's power, unclear of the true intentions of everyone involved in her life, including Comstock and his own employers. The tears add to the mystery, sometimes appearing with music from the wrong decade spilling out of them, raising immediate questions as to the true nature of the phenomenon, Columbia's place in history and even Elizabeth herself. Though their relationship is quickly strained upon first meeting, with neither truly trusting the actions of the other, Elizabeth and DeWitt become allies and even friends, a relationship made possible by BioShock Infinite's superb voice cast.Engagements are typically a fun dance between mixing weapons and abilities while utilizing the environmental possibilities to cut down Infinite's assortment of enemies – snatching powerful weapons from tears, leaping onto skylines and fighting as you glide across the sky. Some of the battles, however, drag on too long and interrupt the flow of story-telling, especially toward the end of the game.In terms of its immediate adversaries, Infinite lacks any foe as terrifying as BioShock's Big Daddy; though the aggressiveness of the Handyman – a robotic behemoth with a human head that literally begs for death – can be a daunting challenge to manage. Both standard and special enemies, even the mini-gun toting Motorized Patriot, eventually become just another thing to shoot at, never reaching the same dangerous heights as BioShock's giant, iconic protector.The ending of the game is marvelous, and you'll have to trust me when I say that BioShock Infinite's final section – dedicated entirely to its narrative – handily disposes of any minor gripes. There is not only one twist to the tale, but many entrances and exits to a wide array of secrets, diving deeper into the past of the primary cast of characters and the world of Columbia itself. The greatest discovery, however, is the love that blossoms between Elizabeth and DeWitt, and how far the pair are willing to go to protect each other.As a game, BioShock Infinite has its successes and its falterings consistent with any suitably complex piece of interactive entertainment. As a story, as an exercise in drawing the player into a believable and relevant world, as proof of exactly what a videogame can mean to a person... BioShock Infinite is damn near perfect.			"

												Bioshock Infinite - it's a masterpiece. Genius. One of the best games in the world. These games are not more often than once every 5 years. It's a dozens of articles and analyzes of the effects of the game on the future of the gaming industry as a whole. Endless arguments with friends about the ideals and the fact that Bioshock is no way it's, but at the same time manages to touch all the chord of the soul! Talk about what is Bioshock Infinite - senselessly,  uselessly, mindlessly! You must to play... No, this word does not fit here. THIS IS NOT A GAME! YOU MUST TO SEE IT!________________________________________________BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea - Episode 1 is amazing! The first full-fledged storyline Bioshock Infinite addon manages to surpass in part hitherto in any game not seen (the closest was DMC 4), fantastic art, better even than in original game. For the first half hour of the game I made about 120 screenshots, 69 of them were selected for display in the gallery of screenshots. Yes, again - the game logical problems reflected even in the framework of such a linear world that prevent immerse yourself in the atmosphere at 100%, but it is not so important when the game gives you such inexpressible sensations. These games come out once in 5, 10 years. They move... Must move the industry forward and set new levels of quality. Again, this is not a 10/10, but its solid 9/10 game definitely deserves. This is one of those games after the exit of which, you has long can't get yourself under all sorts of impressions and own the grumbling want to shove away...________________________________________________			"

												BioShock Infinite.At first, i felt this game was too over-hyped. I mean its another FPS game. I was wrong. This game is worth playing but even more so when you get all the content (DLC packs)At first i was disappointed that the main story campaign only takes an average of 9 Hours to finish even with exploration and a bit of backtracking, the atmosphere was superb, the graphics were phenomenal, the voice acting was superb, and i really fell for the overall feel of Columbia. Then when i finished the campaign, i just kinda let it sit in my library.But then as soon as the Burial at sea Episodes unlocked, i got sucked back into the world of Bioshock. I tell you, they really did a great job on the damn story on this one. The story is superbly thought out and was simply a pleasure to experience.I really felt for Booker, i empathized with him and at one point i felt like i was him. Clinging to this tiny shred of hope that maybe, just maybe i can redeem myself and save this girl for i have already doomed her in another reality. And i really sympathized with Elizabeth. The loneliness and the feeling of being caged off from the world outside the walls she knows so very very well.The game made me question choices and the illusion of free will for you are given a few choices but with pre-determined outcomes. Despite all the good that it has, it has flaws as well.The atmosphere is great but i wish that i could interact with more of the environment aside from the vendors, the trash cans and etc. I'd like to have a conversation with a random civilian and have that person acknowledge me (me as booker at least) and not feign back to the scripted, backgroundish routine that it follows. The plasmids kinda just help you shoot people better, they are useful for stopping your enemies or holding them in place or disabling them so you can deliver some lead to their systems. After a while, i get tired of the phrase ""BOOKER, CATCH!""I particularly like the SkyHook feature as it allows me to sucker punch an unsuspecting enemy into oblivion (if he were standing on a floating piece of real estate in Columbia) I believe that despite the feeling of it being over-hyped, its a great game.It is a masterpiece that can only be done through the gaming medium. Movies, books and music can only hope to scratch the surface of what Bioshock Infinite's story has done. I doubt that any other medium could deliver this story quite as well as the game has already done. But i wouldn't mind seeing some books, graphic novels and other things about BioShock.This sets the bar for storytelling in games that are centered around a full bodied plot.The DLC's story was a perfect example of content that gives you the kind of clarity that you get when you get to the conclusion of a long fairy tale.The final DLC hits the nail on the head, and is a fitting final goodbye from Irrational Games. Get it on sale and get the season pass.Its a hefty Download but damn its worth it.Would you kindly play the game?			"

												Well, although  not the best game in the universe, this game does both right and wrong things all at the same time. The main complaint I have with BioShock Infinite are its two contrasting themes of parallel dimensions mixed in with themes of religiousism, idolfication, the constitution of the United States of America, sexism, hedonism and people in black sheep's clothing, it does too much. There is no separate transition from this main theme towards the other themes of tears, parallel dimensions Elizabeth can will by the power of her memories.  If this was removed the game would be so much better.Let's get down to the breakdown of the game.Gameplay: Gameplay as others have mentioned I am sure already is the repetitive gunplay. There are many situations where you are forced through the in-game script to pick-up weapons you may not want to use in the situations they make you use them in. This is problematic in one of the toughest battles later in the game against warships, zepplins. The guns however do feel nice to use. The sounds of them might be a little unrealistic or barely noted to pay attention to.Story:      This is my largest complaint with the game , even more so then the repetitive gameplay without much variation. Much of the game is told through kinetoscopes which tell majority of the story through a type of film projected roll of film in black-white old cinematic style. However, the story is better presented through non-verbal actions when you meet Elizabeth and when she interacts with you within the world she was trapped in. However, you as an outsider don't understand everything that Elizabeth understands and knows about the world in which she lives in as an insider. This is why they had to put parallel dimensions in this game to make sense of both an insider and outsider perspective of the situations at hand. However, it is poorly executed and done. Religion:     Many of you that are not religous or even Christian for that matter will not understand some of the biblical references to the garden of eden, Sodom of Gomorrah and washing away the debt of sins. However, without spoiling the story too much, one guy comes to you and says you can wash away the debt of your sins if you give your own daughter away; though, it is really unclear if it is yours or Elizabeth when she was a girl. I assumed it was Elizabeth since she is the one they wanted to take Lady Comstock's place in the end .     Themes:Idolfication: The story takes place in the early 1900's. There are points in the game where you enter in upon factory workers being enslaved and  people are  being tortured for heresy against a rising secular cult of people that are not following the true Gospel of God. Everyone in this game is blinded by idolfication. Even the people who follow Comstock, they are just his followers; nothing more. He is the actual false prophet in the game, though they frame you as the AntiChrist when instead you play the role of Jesus. Your job is not to minister to people but to tell them that they are wrong about following this skeptical guy Comstock and his teachings. He is the one that actually should be accused of heresy. However, during this time, Columbia is promised an eternal state of Heaven. However, they believe it has to be done through a human sacrifice of Elizabeth through the baptism of Booker De Witt. Racisim: They have black and white wash stations characteristic of slavery days. There are various jargon and little things I will not be going over as that would spoil the game's experience for you. Take note that there is much racisim and questions regarding the philosophies of the world along with branding people's names of the last sins they have commited upon death. If it takes place in the 1900's sins should be wiped away through Jesus Christ. Ultimately they believe Booker is the AntiChrist. Yet in many parallel dimensions he is seen as the hero and savior of the world of Columbia.Overall: Do I think Christians should play this game though it stands as one of the most controversial triple AAA games out there currently in the bounds of the Christian worldview and modern world? Yes I think you should. This game teaches you what the nation is like and the times we live in today with modernisim using parallel dimensions and universes as the main driving point and vehicle for the message. It shows you both the good and bad things of religion. What works right when religion is performed in a manner based on biblical teachings, then what goes wrong when those biblical teachings are reprimanded when man's leadership is based on the teachings of our country's founders.7/10 Only because many games don't have the courage to discuss idolfication, racisim, sexism and politics in a worldly sphere and through alternative realities relating to the secular realities of men and women on this earth. Even though the game is just your average shooter, it is worth at least for you to check it out for yourself.			"

												INTRODUCTION:Bioshock Infinite is the third installment to the popular Bioshock series. Set in a city in the sky as opposed to the city underwater, this game features a revamped combat mechanic featuring Sky-lines rails and and a new AI companion, all the while, retaining some of the old features of the previous games.You play as Booker DeWitt, a former 7th Cavalry soldier turned Pinkerton who was tasked by unknown individuals to recover a girl, Elizabeth, from the floating city of Colombia. A simple recovery mission quickly turns sour when the girl you have to take turns out to be a very important figure head.PROS:+ Story: -Needless to say, the one primary factor that drives the Bioshock games is they are narrative-driven. This game delivers a very compelling, interesting and immersive story that makes you want to know more about the city and world of Colombia.+ Graphics: -Stunning visuals and magnificent world design makes Bioshock infinite one of the prettiest games of the franchise. Breathtaking scenery, beautiful texture quality and character designs makes the world alive.+ Elizabeth: -I normally frown at escort missions, specially if the AI is poorly programed for, but Bioshock Infinite (despite being an escort mission start to finish) got past that  by introducing an companion AI who is helpful and doesn’t get in the way. She assists the player through support roles providing money, ammo, and regenerative potions all throughout the game. She's not the revolutionary AI companion that everyone was excited about, but she's the closest one we have.+ Optimization: -Was optimized enough for the PC to allow even mid-range desktops or laptops to play the game in relatively high or medium-high settings.CONS:- Combat: -Retains the fun and high paced combat with guns and magic of the previous titles BUT seriously fails due to the poor decision of limiting the player with only TWO weapons carry limit which does not live up to the previous games who had several weapons at the player's disposal. Too many: (1) Kill Bad Guys, (2) Elizabeth Opens Door, Repeat step one, sequences.- Poor Antagonist (No Spoiler): -Explaining this is a bit hard without spoilers. We were introduced with a great antagonist by the name of Andrew Ryan in the first game but I can't help but feel that the new Antagonist, Comstock falls short. Anything more would be a spoiler. Now even the new Songbird creature (kinda like a buffed up Big Daddy) makes very, very limited appearances and its role in the whole story somewhat becomes pointless once you progress.- No sense of Danger: -This has been an illness since the first game. Death in the Bioshock franchise is more of a minor inconvenience than an actual penalty. Vita-Chambers in the first and second Bioshock games made death pointless. This was carried over to Bioshock Infinite where the Vita-Chambers beeing replaced by Elizabeth reviving you every time you get incapacitated. This totally eliminates any sense of dread that you should be feeling in a high combat scenario.CONCLUSION:AN OVERALL GREAT GAME. Though it has its short comings, I would still recommend Bioshock Infinite to any fan of the franchise. It provides a satisfying narrative and introduces new characters that leave a lasting impact.Although I would still RECOMMEND this game to NEW players in the Bioshock franchise, I think this is best appreciated by people who already gone through the first and second games.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												Gameplay 7/10 - For your standard first person shooter mechanics, This game can get repetitive and fast. I mean it's just liek the standard really but still fun none-the-less! The Vigors add that special touch to gameplay, I mean come on...Who doesn't want to throw a bunch of crows at someones face or hurl them 20ft into the air and shoot the hell out of them? Graphics 9/10 - The artistic direction in this game combined with everything else is, in my honest opinion, flawless. They present the city you enter as an ""Eden"" and when you first lay eyes on it, That's exactly what you feel. The colouring is gorgeous and being in a city in the clouds makes it even more eye popping. Only reason I have not gave it a 10/10 is because all the NPC's start to look identical unless they serve some sort of purpose. But hey, who cares? I just couldn't give it the full 10/10 for graphics solely for that purpose and it's not exactly a major issue.Story 10/10 -  The story is epic. I think it's by far the best of all the Bioshock games, Without a doubt. I love the fact we learn more about Elizabeth and how she develops as a character. You see sides to her that are unexpected and really throw a spanner in the works! I cant really go into too much detail without giving too much away but in my opinion the story will have you gripped frmo the first moment.			"

												Bioshock Infinite is, in a word, amazing. It's difficult to put into words just what an overbearing accomplishment of the industry this game represents. This is one of those achievements that prove that video games can have equal stories to that of books or films, or in this case, even blow a large majority of them out of the water.This is one of those games that really sticks with you long after the credits (and amazing post-credits sequence) have rolled, and in my case puts me off playing any other video game for days on end. Everything else just pales in comparison.Before this I held that the original Bioshock had the best story of the series, and the sequel the best combat, but now Infinite combines the best of, and exceeds both in an emotionally driven work of art that has, remarkably, surpassed the brilliance of the original.

												Bioshock Infinite is, in a word, amazing. It's difficult to put into words just what an overbearing accomplishment of the industry this game represents. This is one of those achievements that prove that video games can have equal stories to that of books or films, or in this case, even blow a large majority of them out of the water.This is one of those games that really sticks with you long after the credits (and amazing post-credits sequence) have rolled, and in my case puts me off playing any other video game for days on end. Everything else just pales in comparison.Before this I held that the original Bioshock had the best story of the series, and the sequel the best combat, but now Infinite combines the best of, and exceeds both in an emotionally driven work of art that has, remarkably, surpassed the brilliance of the original.

												oh wow , i personally didn't expect that this game was that amazing. because basically it has perfect everything , didn't feel bored for a moment during the whole scenario and gameplay.-Graphics are awesome and perfectly done , along with the artwork and the cool retro steampunk atmosphere that bioshock is well known with it.-Gameplay is very smooth , you wont face any problems with controls/dynamics no bugs no glitches.-Story is amazing , but abit shocking at the end , full of plot twists actually its one huge plot twist itself :D-Artwork is so amazing that u wont stop taking screenshots to use them as desktop backgrounds...i personally did :D-Its an FPS , game with almost no puzzle efforts unless you want to unlock everything , also the navigation in this game is more than perfect that you wont spend a second trying to figure where u should go.-The game itself features an adventure of a desperate man who wants to wash away his debts , so he is assigned to rescuce and bring back a ''girl'' bla bla don't want to spoiler. but the game is amazing and strongly recommending. 10/10 worth either full or discount prices.

												I'm the type of person who doesn't review games but this game really got too me. I'm not going to write down any ""pros"" or ""cons"" but I will talk about abit of my experience with this game.This game was laying around my house in a case, I was abit sceptical about playing this game considering the games I usually play consists of open world RPG type games so I wasn't really sure how I would enjoy playing a story following game. I have played story games before and I particularly enjoyed portal 2 and beyond two souls (ps exclusive) but I generally would always feel incomplete when I finish a game and I’m unable to keep playing more the often I would be disappointed with an ending and then I would feel as if i wasted my time playing a game that lead nowhere or too have a good story build up for it just too end on a crappy note. This game on the other hand I was actually so happy too finish, it gave me a sense of fulfilment that I generally don’t achieve with this type of game. I was worried about jumping straight into this game because I actually haven't played the first two games but coming to a realisation that Bioshock Infinite had nothing to do with the older games gave me the all clear and I can tell you now that I really want too play the first two before I have a go at the DLC (also because the first two is on sale at the moment) I really don’t know how to write reviews about games without spoiling it but what I can say is that this is the most smart games I’ve ever played it literally is the game that craps all over those people who say that games are unintelligent and that they make you unintelligent when there is heaps too think about when it comes too this game, I finished that game but I am still interested too learn more about the story because I’m sure there are alot of theory’s out there that are going too make this game stay alive. I just wanted too thank my boyfriend for buying me this game and 2K games for publishing this wonderful journey (if I may). Yes this game was an experience I would never forget and I am trying to convince my boyfriend too give it a try now.10/10 -Bree			"

												When I initially saw the trailer for this game before it came out, I was a bit put off. The trailer left me wondering ""WTF is this? Why is this a game about a city in the sky now? Where are the big daddies? What happened to the little sisters? Where's all the water? And why the ♥♥♥♥ is George Washington in this game!?So I finally purchased the game expecting to hate it, wishing through out the whole time that it was like the first 2 games. It only took about 10 minutes for all of that to go out the window. The new world  in Bioshock Infinite is beautiful. Definitely better than  Rapture. Rapture is grimy and there is very little to look at. In Colombia, the atmosphere is a lot more lively. Everywhere you turn there is something to look at, It's like a giant theme-park. Colombia is a lot more open than Rapture, so it allows for combat to be more spread out and not so in your face as in the previous 2 games. The shooting feels a lot better. At first i was a bit bummed like most players about only being able to carry 2 weapons, unlike the previous game were you could carry 8 (I think). It took me a while to see how this 2 weapon system is a lot better IMO. In Bioshock 1 & 2, I pretty much just used 2-3 weapons and it was a pain fumbling around with all the other weapons I had no interest in using. In Infinite you find a lot of the other weapons you aren't carrying around anyway, so it's not like you get stuck with crappy weapons you don't want. Plasmids are still in the game, but now called Vigors. Rather than leveling them up with Adam, you just upgrade them with money in vending machines. No big deal really. The new vending machines are an improvement over the old circus of value ones, I like them. The hacking is gone, don't really care really, after a while it became annoying in the previous games.This game is not about just eye candy, it has a fantastic story just like the previous Bioshock games.  But it does a better job at presenting it. The story is more interactive in this game than the previous, where it was pretty much all driven by the audio logs. Overall i really enjoyed the game. I finished it in 3 sittings. That is something i rarely do, I usually just play like 1/4 of the game and come back to it a few months later in episodes until i finish it. This kept my interest and never really felt dull. It is a great installment in the franchise and I can't wait to see where they take it from here.			"

												One year later... where to start.... Bioshock Infinite has to be one of the most gripping and best stories, if not THE best story I've ever played in a video game. The mechanics are solid, the sky city of Columbia is beautiful, the prodigious voice acting and character development are outstanding, and last, but certainly not least-the story. The ending will stick in your head for a long time. The game leaves a mark. Like I said, it's gripping. Highly recommended. 10/10			"

You start playing and you just step into another world! The graphics, the style, the story... this game is pure art. <3This is definitely one of the best games I've played.

												Since I started gaming year 1999 this game is easily one of my top 5 best games i've ever played. The interactions between the two characters, the story, and the combat makes this a very appealing game. The last 15 minutes of the game will be a total mind♥♥♥♥ and you'll probably gonna have to visit Youtube for clarification and it will also leave you depressed and wondering how they can make dlc after it so play the dlc to find out how. Be aware that it's singleplayer only so if you're looking fo multiplayer then you're out of luck. A MUST own for everyone with amazing graphics that can be pulled off with a rather old PC. 9/10, it would be a 10/10 if not for the ending although the fact that this game has affected me so much after spending 14 hours to finish the story it has to get a high grade. Buy it now!			"

 Bioshock Infinite  The third part of this series considered to be one of my favorite games and why, let me explain to you. The story itself is brilliantly written the same as the characteristics of the major characters. The main character is Booker DeWitt who was a detective in Pinkerton agency. Our hero Going to Columbia on a mission to save a girl and pay off debts. The graphics are very pretty but the biggest role in my opinion, plays here the lighting is simply wonderful.Textures are nice but only on the main characters, ordinary residents, guards, etc... does not differ much from each other. The area on which we will give you a lot of freedom of action and the possibility of exploration btw. in the major areas will move on the ribbons with the help of the hook attached to the wrist. To survive we will use different types of weapons and vigors and the hook which also giving us a food melee weapon and nicely executed finishes. I recommend this game to all, this game is not that difficult but it is not that easy, and for demanding i recommend ""1999 Mode"". :)  "

												boy oh boy where do i start Visuals + Even tho i played on medium, the game still looks AMAZING. i didnt experience any fps drops. (Capped 60)- If you watched the gameplay trailer for this, it looks really diffrent from the game you're gonna play. I never watched it, so its okay for me.10/10 Story + Amazing story. it kept me hooked and i always wondered what's gonna happen next.+ There are some choices you can make, but its very limited. i wouldn't mind more choices (imo)- There's no real other character other than Booker,Elizabeth and Comstock.(Sure, there's Slate and fitzroy etc. but they really dont have personalities and they just advance the plot.)This doesn't bother me much, the game is amazing anyway. - The ending is confusing af9.7/10 Gameplay You can carry 2 weapons at once, and you have a melee weapon wich you can't equip. And vigors. These are basically spell like things. they cost salt, (mana) there's 8 of them and they unlock throughout the game. You can upgrade all of these by spending money.If i go on like this, this is gonna turn into a guide so...+ Weapons, there aren't many of them, but i used all of them at some point. Because...Ammo!Finding ammo is hard. you can loot ammo on guys u killed but it doesnt drop a lot. Even if it does most of the time its not for the weapons you have. So even tho some weapons are really OP (yes, i'm looking at you hand cannon) you cant always use them. this was a good move imo.+ gunfights are good+ Loot system wich is fun+ New game+ option wich i like- control's are a bit diffrent from a classic FPS if this is your first Bioshock game. (Z for aim down sites etc.) but you can easily change it. - IRRATIONAL GAMES, YOU HAD THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THIS GAME AN OPEN WORLD. I mean look at the city. It's AMAZING, yet we dont get to explore it ? we even have the railroad things to move around quickly. This could've been game changing, and could've made this game the best game i ever played. (its still in top 5 tough)9/10 Elizabeth ''Dude this is the best companion ever''-me+ Congrats to irrational games for really nailing this.As we know from RPG's, escort missions can be really,really BORING. Can you imagine how bad this game would be if this was the case? since she's like %80 of the game.+ Her dialog is very good. She doesnt sound generic and boring. +During battle, she will supply you with ammo,health kits and salts. and money if she finds some, while you're safe.SPOILER+Also,she can drag weapons,medical supplies,some additional cover,turrets etc. from other dimensions via tears she can open.END OF SPOILER LOL10/10 Overall 96/100 Easily one of the best games i have ever played.

												This game is perfect for you if you are a fan of really great world and story. You can start with this Bioshock game or with previous ones. You can understand the story without playing Bioshock 1&2 but there are some elements connected with previous games (especially in Burial At Sea DLC). If you want understand the story you should listen to audio journals. Elisabeth might become your favourite video game character ever. The gameplay itself maybe a little bit tiring especially after the first half of the game (a lot of enemies). Personally I love this game and would recommend 10/10.			"

												Bring us the girl. Wipe away the debt.Bioshock Infinite is a fantastic First-Person shooter in the sense that it has fun gameplay with a strong narrative behind it,driving the game forward. You take the role as Booker Dewitt, a man we know nothing about, and you are asked to find the girl and if done so, you will wipe away the debt. The story seems to be simple but as the game goes along, it gets more intricate and by the end it had me in awe. Even the second time around. The dialogue and voice acting is some of the best I have ever heard (Troy Baker is God) and it really helps immerse the player into the world of Columbia. I found myself finding and playing every single voxophone, small voice recordings of characters, because I loved the side/back stories behind all the characters introduced.Elizabeth, the girl, is a strong female lead for the game because she is very likable. She has some great AI mechanics which do not hinder the fastpaced gameplay but instead make it more interesting and fun as Elizabeth throws whatever she can at your aid to benefit you. The gun mechanics feel very smooth and the added Vigors allow more variety to be in play from ""shock powers"" to ""calling in a swarm of crows"" powers and it really helps make the game so much more fun. Another aspect which makes the game so much fun is introduced a little into the game and it is the skylines. The skylines allow the player to ride above the ground and land off and attack or flank enemies from all over the area. The main story clocked in for me at about nine hours which I think was the perfect length for a game like this. I played the game originally when it released on the Playstation 3 and I enjoyed the feel of the game a whole lot more on PC. It runs better, it looks better, it plays better, it feels better, and it is better on the PC than the consoles. With some great dialogue, an intriguing story that keeps unraveling until the very end, and some very fun first person shooter combat, Bioshock Infinite is just one fantastic game. 9/10			"

												Wow.That's all I could say when I finished the game, this wasn't just another game, it was an experience, one of the best gaming experiences I've had yet.I loved the first two Bioshock games, but after several hours, rapture began to feel repetitive even it was an unique and interesting enviroment.Bioshock Infinite doesn't suffer from this problem at all, Columbia feels vibrant, alive and unique without dragging on one aspect from the city too long.Many will say that they feared that the FPS genre had reached it's capabilities, but this game is ""the savior of FPSs"" we've been waiting for, I think this game will reach the legendary status of Half Life 2 and the original Deus Ex.Every part of Columbia has a story to tell, even the restrooms!Let's take the restrooms for example here, the game is set in 1912 and the city of Columbia is an attempt to realise the American Dream, but the city relies heavily on immigrant workforces, while the well situated citizens have restrooms that looks almost like a palace, the restrooms of the african and asain workers are just tiles and broken sinks.There is also a ton of propaganda, posters and art all around Columbia which all serve a purpose and make the game even more immersive.The gameplay feels fluent and well executed, especially in the larger battles where you can jump on the so called ""sky-lines"" to soar across the battliefield and strike foes from above or even shoot them while riding the sky-line.The enemy AI isn't dumb either, they will follow you on sky-lines and try to block your way, handymen will even electrocute the whole line to force you off.The weapons and vigors (plasmids) also work great and a lot of combinations are possible, you could for instance lift a whole group of foes up in the air with the ""Bucking Bronco"" vigor and then let a swarm of vicious crows loose on them, and if you want you can lights said crown on fire as well!I've said ""no game is perfect"" many times, but I can't really come up with anything that this game doesn't execute well.10/10, absolutely worth every penny if you're a FPS lover or a sucker for an amazing story!

												After the great Bioshock (one of my most favourite games of all times) and a quite mediocre Bioshock 2 I was curious if Bioshock Infinite would be so amazing as the previews mentioned. Now I am glad I just bought it on Steam Autumn Sale for less than 10 €...Bioshock 3 is a shooter, quite different from the previous titles. By the setting in a town, floating in the sky, it lost all of it's dark and terrifying atmosphere which made Bioshock once so great.So let's start by the good things:Bioshock 3 isn't bad at all. Technical:Graphically fitting you walk through a shiny world, see scyscrapers and go by the sky-line railsystem from platform to the other. I played the game with highest graphics, but it is only mediocre. Sound is ok, but not overwhelming.Fighting:Weapons are varying and for every taste you get some weapons. In my case the huntsman carbine and the pig flak volley gun... *cough*Enemies act not too stupid. Only few enemy types.The vigors, Jedi-like forces that support in quite funny ways, are quite different and function quite good. Story:The story seems easy at the start, but gets very twisted later. You might need more than playthrough to get everything of the story. Some few hidden places you can find while playing, giving you special equipment like hats and stuff.Now the bad things:I am totally disappointed. Forget the trailers...Technical:Graphically it is ok, but that's it. Nothing special.Another nuisance is the ""invisible wall"". In games from the 1990's an invisible wall as level-border can be accepted. In games from 2012/2013 NOT. Dear programmers, do me a favour: stop creating the illusion I could walk somewhere when I CAN'T!Fighting:Fights are mostly too chaotic. And the enemies can see through walls (in some cases also SHOOT through walls...).A lot of vigors, the half of it would have been already enough. I just used shock jockey, possession (only at the last airship level) and devil's kiss (which traps didn't work sometimes....). The rest is a nice idea. I missed a freezing power. Oh wait... THAT you get in a dlc. Amazing..............................Story:I enjoyed the story, it was pushing you forward, wanting to know what happens next. I really didn't expect the turns, ups and downs of the story. But the end: At first I was irritated, then thought of it all. Remebered the game.... and uninstalled. Seriously? After all these hours? Dear writers, I love good written stories. You did a pretty good job there, but this ending is the most stupid I have ever seen in a game. Ok, maybe not THE worst, but it is very close to that rank.Things that COULD have made Bioshock Infinite better:There could have been so many possibilities to play with the fear of heights of the players, but this chance was missed.I have a fear of heights, but wasn't one time afraid of falling down somewhere.Bugs like waving textures (really annoying in ingame-cutscenes), missing textures or missing sounds should be fixed before selling a game.Only three persons are consistant in this game, the player, Elizabeth, and the prophet.

												I am not a FPS person, but the Bioshock series is the only FPS series that I like to play.Infinite is different than the previous games when you look at the atmosphere. It is still in an Art Deco setting, but it seems to be a lot brighter at first sight. But it gets darker when you get more into the storyline.I liked the graphics and artstyle a lot. I love the city of Columbia. And you can fly around on a rails through the city, how cool is that?The story is very interesting as well. It is quite complicated, but when you progress you can understand it a lot better. I also think that Elizabeth is a good sidekick, she was quite helpful to me (as a FPS noob hehe). The vigours are a good addition as well, in my opinion.And the DLC are good to play as well. They are not superlong, but give you a better insight of the story.Would I recommend this game? Yes, definitely! My rating for this game: 9/10.			"

												I have to say, without further adue, this game is above a decent level. However, I do have my problems with it, coming from a Bioshock 1 fan. I find the openness of the environment to be tiresome, I see many opportunities for this game to be completed easily - especially then atleast at a medium or hard mode.  As I played it, I found the plot to become more and more predictable. I felt as if the concept of Columbia being a bigger wonder than Rapture, yet not being featured as a first game in the series, was sort of confusing. They harness the same knowledge as the founders of Rapture, hell, maybe even more, and they've built a city in the skies... I truly hope there will be a Bioshock 3 and that Infinite is simply a spin-off. I liked the combat mechanics alot. I have to say though - what I truly am thankful for is that I got this on sale, and I'm sorry to bring such a negative review to such talented devs, but this game is not in my taste.			"

												Bioshock Infinite is one of those games where you start playing and you quickly lose track of time because of how much you enjoy the game.+ The gameplay is fantastic, you several special abilities (Vigor's) to use as well as an assortment of weapons to switch between that doesn't get boring+ Skyhooking everywhere is fun+ The plot is amazing and captivating, and the ending will leave you in a stupor much like Inception+ The character developement is awesome, between Booker, the Twins, Elizabeth <3, and even Comstock, the game does an amazing job of getting you to like and hate certain characters+ Imagine you're playing kill the Westboro Baptist Church members simulatorI wanted to play it again after I played through the rest of the Bioshock family in order like my friends recommend, but I eventually got too lazy and distracted as other games came out, but I definitely regret not going back and doing that.9/10			"

Elizabeth is completely ignored by enemies so why is Booker protecting her and not just getting the heck out?

												Should you get ""Bioshock Infinite"" if you loved the previous Bioshock games? Well, maybe. Part of me is satisfied, and the other part is let down. I missed the iconic Big Daddy and Little Sisters , yet Songbird and Elizabeth were incredible characters in their own rights. ""Bioshock Infinite"" takes everything you loved from the depths of Rapture and molds it into something brilliant located in the flying city of Columbia, where a surprising sense of isolation will lure you into its world accompanied with a gorgeous visual style, unbelievably detailed textures and some of the generation's best voice acting. I still miss Rapture when I revisit Columbia, yet ""Bioshock Infinite"" is a game that pulled me in and didn't let go far after I've completed it, and that's something I love about videogames.			"

												When I was done playing Bioshock, I'd assumed that we had a once in a decade game, and anything to come further would just be piloting off of a fluke. Bioshock 2 came along and my convictions seemed confirmed; and then this title's extremely high score was simply because of a level of funding that 2 didn't get, and I'd prepare for it to be not as great as what the 'bought reviews' might say, but still playing it out of respect to the original.I was wrong. The score is justified. It took the original and it transcended.There was a man, there was a game, there was a profound sense of satisfaction.			"

												BioShock Infinite... one of the most critically overhyped game, is THE biggest disappointment of the year for me by FAR.The game starts out very, very strong by showing you our character, Booker DeWitt and explaining why he has the mission to find a mysterious girl by the name of Elizabeth, and so is sent to the world of Columbia, a colossal city in atop the sky. I say it starts out strong is because it wastes no time in immersing you into what you immediately see a vast city filled with life and soul, but it quickly drops after you're introduced to the actual game.~Visuals           Right at the very beginning, you can see how beautiful the game is. With vibrant colors and clean textures for most of what you see. Although some items thruought the world of Columbia have muddy textures and just things that look downright lazy, it's essentially a nitpick when you see what the real focus of the game is - however those items are still present and detract from the overall ambiance. Enemy models and the such are varied throught the game when it switches the standard Columbia militia for members of a cult organization to supernatural entities.~Sound           Not much to say for this game. The game has a few ambiance setting melodies throughout to keep the mood running the way the situation calls for it, though generally you won't notice the music running in the background at all, there aren't any real unforgettable scores other than Elizabeth's Theme. The rest of the game does a fairly well job of relaying how guns work, the enemies yelling in the background mocking you, the distance of their gunshots, etc. My best mention sound wise, is the soundwork for Songbird - it is genually as creepy as the Big Daddy's cry in the original BioShock.~Gameplay            Sadly though, this is actually where the game faulters. The game quickly starts you on a shooting romp that is seemingly never ending without much variation. From the very first gunfight you have in the game, the only things that change is when you get more weapons, more vigors and Elizabeth starts using her powers, most of which, with the exception of Elizabeth, do nothing to improve the base gameplay the game has to offer.           You can use vigors (very similar to that of BioShock 1 & 2, but in here, you're better off going the ""gung ho"" way as the vigors on this game are pretty underpowered, nearly all of them, except for the ""Shock Jockey"" vigor, are damn near useless or do same thing as others do or does next to nothing at all(Lol wash away your enemies). Elizabeth presents the most to the gameplay as the game (I'm aware of the 90's mode the game has) gets incredibly easier when she tags along. Elizabeth can activate turrets, robots to help you get the enemy, decoys, cover, health, etc to help you in your battles, while there's not variation here either - it's still a welcome addition that's also pretty original in any game.           Sadly, the rest of the game can be summed up with one description: Shooting Gallery. The game literally consists of you moving from room to room in what the game tries to illusionate is an open world, but is actually a long corridor - you effectively run from room to room shooting dozens of enemies, kill them, run in a straight line to another room, kill more dozens of enemies ~ rinse and repeat. It tries to incorporate strategy by incorporating the ""Skyhook"" as a means to move about the combat area, but that only serves to be a cheap way of ""saving bullets"" and killing enemies and it generally very useless outside of combat and in areas that don't have a rail on 'em. All in all, the game was a disappointment for me as I was expecting more story and interactivity from a game that had promised just that. Instead I believe we got a game with an unsettling pace, extremely linear gameplay, a forgettable soundtrack and it was just overall a forgettable, generic experience.**Just to clear up some misconception - No, BioShock Infinite is not a bad game. It's not inherently broken or buggy (PC wise, it's actually one of the better ports out there), this is just what it is, an opinion, to me this game was one of the most repetitive experiences I've had this year and the story bits were too scarce for me to really get into it. I don't have fun mindlessly shooting wave after wave of enemies, if you do, then by all means get the game.			"

This game feels weaker in all of those regards in exchange for a more  engaging story, gun focassed combat and linear set pieces. Its not the Bioshock I fell in love with and frankly, I found the game to be dull and a bit to linear.			"

												Bioshock Infinite is the third in the Bioshock trilogy, bringing to a close the story of our Protagonist. A Steampunk-styled, dystopian alternate universe; However, instead of traveling to city at the bottom of the ocean, you are transported to a sky city where everything is Heaven-flavored, that is until it all goes to Hell. Fast. I have to admit, I sort of fell in love with the series after a short time playing the very first Bioshock. I found myself wanting to immerse myself in the story and learn all I could, while trying to survive not only the hidden things lurking around corners, but the scattered people who seem to have gone completely insane. This Bioshock was different. In this, the people of the sky city are told by their rulers, whom they almost seem to worship, that you are The Marked One, who must be killed. So instead of encountering people who are completely insane, you are chased, cornered, and attacked by people of thinly veiled sanity, from a once seemingly utopian society. I would recommend this game, as well as the entire Trilogy, as it was fun, exciting, and worth at least a playthough.			"

												If it weren't a BioShock game, I might have liked it better.I'll skip the poetic details and get straight into my gripes, in no specific order:-Repetitive gameplay that provides little challenge, even on the hardest difficulty.-Extremely linear level design that provides no challenge for advancing the game.-Whereas the previous BioShock games had level design that could convincable be used as a city, Infinite's Columbia wouldn't be mistaken for an actual city in a hundred years. Each area was clearly designed solely to be a combat arena, with the mere aesthetic of a city.-Boring, generic characters that all fit at least one archetypical mold.-The story, though sort of interesting in its own right, was predictable, anticlimactic, and ultimately strayed too far from the original BioShock storyline.-The ""vigors"" we too powerful, the AI was unintelligent, and the weapon/""vigor"" upgrade system was way too easy to access, all of which leads back into the point of unchallenging gameplay.-The hacking system has been removed entirely.-Alternate Ammo Types have been removed (the Vox Varients could arguably be ""ammo types,"" but that's stretching it).-The shield system makes the game very easy (ProTip: Invest in shields, not HP. Shields regenerate).-When your health does manage to get too low, you have to rely on Elizibeth for aid, because Health Packs have been removed.-Elizibeth's ability to open ""tears"" that give you another advantage in the fight were pure cheese.-Most of the weapons were far outshined by other weapons (I used the Carbine and Triple-R the whole game).-The ""Equipment System"" is a crappy reissue (downgrade, imo) of the Gene Tonic system.-The ""Boss Enemies"" are not a challenge.-There was only one real boss fight (two, if you count that the same boss is used twice).and lastly, and most firmly,-The Skylines. Whilst on them, you are practically invulnerable. When diving from them, your attack is a one hit kill. If a Skyline is in one of the fighting areas, I cheesed it to no end because why shouldn't I? That's what it's there for.All in all, the game would have been better had it not been called a BioShock game, but that only alleviates any problems I had with story and/or systems crossed over from previous games being changed for the worse (gene tonics to equipment, health packs to Elizibeth giving you health, etc.). The DLCs are actually more fun than the base game, but they are woefully short.I would recommend this game to Matthew Perry, the actor that portrayed Chandler in the extremely over-rated SitCom ""FRIENDS.""I hate Matthew Perry.

												Visually stunning and there are areas you enter that make you stand and just take it all in. Without a word of a lie, the music and visuals in the first main room took my breath way. My first walk in city streets left me in awe.And creepy. Do ""they"" need to look at me intensely, even as I walk away?Alas, gameplay got up my nose. Not because it was overly difficult but because it was too cluttered. There were certain scenes that completely flumoxed me because I simply could not see or identify what was going on. OK, I am ""older"" than the average FPS gamer so hamfisted and blurred vision after 1 or 2 scotches is quite common but I just can't escape the fact that I stopped wanting to play extended sessions because it became too much.Some really scary moments if you're not careful and a clever story line with some rather crude references to some belief systems. Some conjecture was raised about racism on the Steam forums but they were taken out of context. Such references imho, acutely remind us of the past and must be seen for what they are.I had some issue with the controls for quite sometime. Coming from Bioshock, I was pressing keys ""instinctively"" in some fight scenes and it made it harder than it could have been. Weapon selection and ""plasmid"" selection tripped me up more than once. Some keys were even difficult to get to when it was full on. (tbh, I didn't check if there was an ability to change bindings and if there is, some may chose to for reasons just mentioned.)One small point if I may, weapon choices started to get silly. When entering a hostile area, the weapon ""choice"" offered sort of gave away what was coming so the element of surprise was taken away. I repeatedly found myself sticking with the carbine and the sniper rifle and not bothering much with some ""ïnteresting"" weapons that just didn't do the damage I expected given their implied ""awesomeness"". This was a let down in my view.Even some of the choices of the ""secondary weapon""system"" became confusing and I found I stopped using them at times because the effects were marginal or even completely unknown.All in all, a good game, beautifully presented and it held a special fascination for me. I just wish the playing field was a little less cluttered but perhaps, given other highly regarded reviews, it's just my age showing through.Pretty intense at times and without giving away too much, employing ""AI"" to assist at times was very well done. 8.5/10gg			"

Posted: January 17, 2014
												BioShock Infinite, yet another game in the beloved BioShock series.  Or is it?The game is set in the year 1912.  Booker Dewitt accepts a job to travel to Columbia, a city suspended in the air, in order to retrieve a girl (Elizabeth) and wipe away his ""debts"".  I don't know how much else I can say without spoiling some bits, so I'll just get right into the review.You see, Inifinite not only has a different setting.  It's very, very different to the first two games, in fact.  So different to the point where one could easily say that it's just a game that only has a different, original setting (as well as some lovely throwback references to the series) in common with it's franchise.  That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the game and find it to be a great addition.The game itself is fantastic.  The story was good, combat was quite good, the setting was fantastic and I found myself enjoying the characters (Elizabeth, The Lutece Twins and Songbird were probably my favourites.  Yes, even Songbird).One who tries to play this game as if it were the original BioShock (or the second) will not do too well.  This game is more of an open-ish world shooter with large areas to move around while in combat.  As well as this, the player can utilize Columbia's transport system (Sky-Lines, metal lines that one can traverse with a grappeling hook) to fight foes and move around the city.  It's a cool feature in general.When watching the game be played, the main fear I had was that Elizabeth would be constantly forced as a character I desperately needed to care about.  While this is true in some respects, I didn't neccesarily find her overbearing.  In fact, I began to enjoy her company as well as the character throughout the game.  That being said, though, she definitely isn't a companion; more of a follower.One thing to note is that you can no longer carry more than two weapons.  Apparently the downloadable-content ""Burial at Sea"" allows this once again as the player returns to the city of Rapture but since this is about the main game I'll just say it's a bit of a letdown.  I'm not thrilled that the change was made, but it's not something I believe you should focus on.Another thing to note is that the little ""boss"" characters that the character finds throughout the game aren't utilized very well.  I find that they're nowhere near as memorable as the Big Daddy characters that the player encounters in the first game.  It's a letdown indeed.  That brings me onto another topic; Plasmids.  Plasmids, or ""Vigors"" as they are now called, just aren't as memorable as the ones you encounter in Rapture.  On top of that, I only found myself using two or three of them on a regular basis compared to the first two games where I would use a wide variety.To sum it up, this is a good game that should keep you occupied.  If you're one who likes to play through games multiple times once you get it I'm sure this could keep you entertained for a while.  That being said, I still can't overcome my biased attitude towards the first game in the series and would definitely reccommend that, if you're willing to pay for this game, you at least consider getting the first one as well.

												As a gamer, I was of course excited to hear about another BioShock title in development, but I was skeptical towards its potential success. Upon release, BioShock: Infinite was praised with positive reviews that I personally noted, but they did not alter my skepticism. How wrong was I? Completely. Totally. Utterly. Rarely does any medium of entertainment--from books to movies---challenge my perceptions or affect my emotions. BioShock: Infinite did and I'm not sure why. The game is a virtual rollercoaster ride that mixes strong dramatization, story, characters and new gameplay mechanics that build up another one of Ken Levine's twisted dystopias. The game also offers one of the most compelling non-playable characters (NPCs) to date that will ultimately lure you into the world of BioShock. The game is beautiful, varied and philosophical in its representation. BioShock: Infinite has displaced the Mass Effect series as my all-time favorite game which is a statement unto itself considering the length of one game versus a trilogy. You owe it to yourself to enjoy the BioShock experience!			"

												Quedé completamente fascinado con el juego. Es sublime tanto gráfica como artísticamente, se nota enseguida que es una obra maestra. El modelado y la IA de Elizabeth son tremendos.El gameplay es genial, no aburre. Los plásmidos esta vez son menos pero se pueden combinar mejor y tienen un modo de uso alternativo. Hay suficientes armas, aunque sólo podés llevar dos a la vez. El juego en hard es muy complicado en momentos puntuales, lo que a mi gusto le suma puntos. Luego de pasarlo se desbloquea el modo 1999, un reto que le otorga rejugabilidad.La trama atrapa enseguida. Hay grandes momentos con grandes personajes y muy buenos diálogos. El final... el final es de los mejores que tuve el placer de ver, me dejó con la pija en mano.Claramente está a un nivel superior a la mayoría de los juegos. Se nota que está muy cuidado. Seguramente se convierta en un juego de culto. Ken Levine lo volvió a hacer.			"

YouTube™ Video: Bioshock Infinite, Burial at Sea Episode 2: Impressions 

			Views: 307		

			Bioshock Infinite: Burial at Sea Part 2 We talk about the last installment to Bioshock Infinite. Burial at Sea Part 2. We go into what set this installment apart from previous installments, as well...		

The video above is my impressions of BURIAL AT SEA PART 2! and not of the Core infinite game.Bioshock infinite as a whole is a quality game, with break taking visuals and amazing sound assets. The story will leave you awe struck, as the characters are interesting and well fleshed out.The expansions of this game will vary in quality.Burial at seas pt.1:This expansion was interesting, I enjoyed it quite a lot. It's really more of the same, but with an expanded story and it takes place in the good ol' Rapture!Burial at seas pt.2:This installment in my opinion was more interesting than pt.1. Though both good on their own, part 2 mixed this up by focusing on stealth, and allowing you to play from Elizabeth's perspective.Clash in the Clouds:This is ok. It's nothing to right home about. Basically an arena style arcade version of the core. Allows you to keep fighting and keep upgrading for ever. Alright if you are hooked to the combat of this game, but otherwise, kind of a filler.Overall the core game is fantastic, and the expansion pack not too shabby.			"

												Visually stunning and there are areas you enter that make you stand and just take it all in. Without a word of a lie, the music and visuals in the first main room took my breath way. My first walk in city streets left me in awe.And creepy. Do ""they"" need to look at me intensely, even as I walk away?Alas, gameplay got up my nose. Not because it was overly difficult but because it was too cluttered. There were certain scenes that completely flumoxed me because I simply could not see or identify what was going on. OK, I am ""older"" than the average FPS gamer so hamfisted and blurred vision after 1 or 2 scotches is quite common but I just can't escape the fact that I stopped wanting to play extended sessions because it became too much.Some really scary moments if you're not careful and a clever story line with some rather crude references to some belief systems. Some conjecture was raised about racism on the Steam forums but they were taken out of context. Such references imho, acutely remind us of the past and must be seen for what they are.I had some issue with the controls for quite sometime. Coming from Bioshock, I was pressing keys ""instinctively"" in some fight scenes and it made it harder than it could have been. Weapon selection and ""plasmid"" selection tripped me up more than once. Some keys were even difficult to get to when it was full on. (tbh, I didn't check if there was an ability to change bindings and if there is, some may chose to for reasons just mentioned.)One small point if I may, weapon choices started to get silly. When entering a hostile area, the weapon ""choice"" offered sort of gave away what was coming so the element of surprise was taken away. I repeatedly found myself sticking with the carbine and the sniper rifle and not bothering much with some ""ïnteresting"" weapons that just didn't do the damage I expected given their implied ""awesomeness"". This was a let down in my view.Even some of the choices of the ""secondary weapon""system"" became confusing and I found I stopped using them at times because the effects were marginal or even completely unknown.All in all, a good game, beautifully presented and it held a special fascination for me. I just wish the playing field was a little less cluttered but perhaps, given other highly regarded reviews, it's just my age showing through.Pretty intense at times and without giving away too much, employing ""AI"" to assist at times was very well done. 8.5/10gg			"

												Querida gente, me gustaria presentarles bioshock infinite.Para dejar libre de spoilers solo puedo decirlos en que es una experiencia al fondo y mas alla de lo posiblemente razonable en estas eras, un juego que brilla por su complejidad, por su cantidad de tension emocional, y por una historia mas alla de lo comprensible.de seguro ya sabran que es un juego sobre la ciudad columbia, una ciudad voladora, donde te ponen en la piel de booker dewitt, para buscar a una niña, ELLIZABETH, para terminar una deudasi les digo algo, es que una vez que terminas este juego, sabes que nada es lo que creias que era, nada, desde la religion, la ciencia, la politica, y el trauma de un hombre, por hacer lo indudable, por las premocioniones de una persona, por vender a su hija, por todo el centro, cuando uno logra darse cuenta a finales del juego que tu eres el centro, es impensable como una historia tan compleja se divide en 2 lineas temporales que crean un circulo infinito donde alguien intentta encontrar la redemcion, pero que falla siempre y el mundo decae ante su incompetencia, como logra darse cuenta quien fue quien es y  que hizo, que sus recuerdos se borran a la linea temporal, la relacion que haces con ellizabeth, es tmuy profunda, y al conclusion rompe esta relacion a uno de los finales, no AL FINAL MAS ESPECTACULAR EN UN VIDEOJUEGO, donde se solidifica que era el todo y como es tan inteligente la historia que logra explicar la primera entrega de bioshock, explica infinite, explica las lineas temporales, hasta lo mas basico como quien eres tu, y como sabes que para lograr acabar el loop infinito de dolor, es siendo bautizado en las aguas puras hasta que estas llenen tus pulmones.bioshock infinite usa mcuhos temas y lo tratas de forma impecable.Politica,Redemcion,Ciencia,Fisica,Teorias combinandolo con la Fé,Las premoniciones, y encadenando esas preguntas tan vanales en una respuesta hecha con una tinta jamás vista por tus ojos, el juego va mas alla que eso. es tan emocional, y tan impactante.Finalmente mi veredicto es chorrosientas estrellas 20.000 awards pero hablando enserio, es de esos juegos que debes jugar antes de morir, de esos que cuando en 200 años mas hablen de videojuegos, la saga BioShock Sea el pilar mas culminante y brillante hasta ahora, y esque las palabras no explican lo brillante que este videojuego es, debes jugarlo por ti mismo.te advierto que es dificil, y es muy complejo, ademas que aborda temas que edades muy cortas no entenderian, llamarlo una obra de arte es desprestigiarlo, es mucho mas que eso, es la obra culminante de un artista que ha emprendido todo un viaje para terminar su obra.10/10. MEJOR JUEGO DEL AÑO ADELANTADO. Espinazos en la espalda garantizados, Lagrimas garantizadas, Accion garantizadas, argumento increible y brillante garantizado, Una experiencia que sea tan increible, que probablemente se tache a fuego en tu mente, como una experiencia inolvidable 100% GARANTIZADO!

												This game was very impressive, a great treat for anyone that likes the idea of time travel, steam punk outfits and the lifestyle or anyone who enjoys FPS. This game i felt was intirely on it's own when it came to the bioshock series introducing Elizabeth and Booker who have all these adventures through the floating city of Columbia which has alot of american history elements to the game, while playing as booker and meeting elizabeth you find out little tears that can actually stop time and go further into the past but they soon find out that if you change something throughout time there is consequences. As to gameplay this game is extremly smooth running on my AMD card and i had zero issues with any part in the game, as to weapons and customizable features you can add to the weapons i thought that was really fun, using the grappling hook to travel to different parts of the world was very amusing and it can also be used as a weapon! Very enjoyable game i highly reccomend this game to all my friends and to anyone that wants to play something new! it's really worth every dollar!			"

Bioshock fans onlyFirst of all, I'm a Bioshock fan.That's said, let's talk about Infinite. The universe of Infinite is good, not as good as Rapture in Bioshock1/2 but they tried to make something very original, they added another ""dimension"" of the game but it's kinda tricky and the universe of Bioshock was enough original to not add this part. I think they went too far in the mind **** and if you are not a fan, it's easy to be lost in the scenario.The mechanics of the game are basically the same as the first one, with few new features. It's clean and good, nothing to add. The game is really good in all aspects except the scenario as I mentionned. The combats are great, not too easy or too hard, there are a lot of things hidden and depending the play-style you choosed/accepted (sometimes you take what you found) you can manage the situations differently but at the end it's always painful for the ennemies.Gameplay: 8/10Graphics: 8/10Music: 7/10Story for fans: 7/10Story for newcomers: 4/10 "

												Some people say its the worst game in the bioshock triplet and they maybe right, because the first two were too damn good.But some people even say this game isn't worth playing compared to the other parts of the series.But that isn't right.This game offers everything i loved in the other bioshock games: a unique setting, an interesting story, nice visuals (not as outstanding for its time like bioshock 1, but who cares? still good), surprisingly many ways to play the game and some really good voice actors (at least if you play the game in the original language).If you come from other shootergames you may be surprised of the length of the story, another pro.Bioshock infinite offers some funny mechanics, with even more possibilities as in the first two games, simply because of yoour new friend: the hook.Also, its another game i would recommend to play a second time, not just for the achievements, but also to discover some more little twists in the awesome plot you don't get on the first run.After all, i would give 9/10 points for Bioshock Infinite, just to show there is allways the possibility to get better.

												(Just to let you know, I got only like 3-5 hours into Bioshock Infinite on my Ps3, so I can't get all things right since it has been quite a while.)Bioshock Infinite is a lot more different than the last two. Unlike the creepiness on Bioshock 1 and 2, this is more focused on Action. Your name is Booker, and you are trying to find this girl named Elizabeth who has some very strange, yet amazing powers. But the reason why this Town of Heaven went to Hell because AD is on your right hand, and the people are racist. So while you are on your quest, you have to kill police and other enemies.The combat can get intense, and sometimes you don't even know what is going on. Don't get me wrong, the combat is crazy fun, but sometimes it can get a bit out of hand. In Bioshock Infinite, you use Vigors (almost the same as plasmids) to get your powers, and you use Salt to cast some more. It can come from throwing Fireballs to summoning Crows to damage your enemies. The rail grinding, it can be the most fun thing in the game. Rail Grinding plus The Intense Action equals The Most Fun Out Of This Game.But since the combat is different, the controls were changed. V is the Melee, Q is to switch Vigors, and E to switch weapons. You can change the controls, but I think that getting used to the normal controls is the smartest idea.OVERALL:If you were expecting for this to be like actual Bioshock 1 or 2, you might be disappointed. But If you love intense action FPSs, you will love this game. I can't recommend this enough!			"

												This series is more story than game at this point. I felt like I was shooting enemies just so I could earn the next bit of exposition at times. One of the criticisms leveled against the first Bioshock was the drop in quality during the third act, after the climax. Infinite attempts to address this by ending the base campaign right after the appropriate moment. Those unhappy with the ending are welcome to try the DLC, although I doubt anyone looking for a happy ending will be satisfied with that either. I like sad stories so of course I thoroughly enjoyed it. As always, the value here depends heavily on your expectations. I have to agree with zero punctuation on this one - it's not perfect, you can point out the flaws, but its way more ambitious than most anything else that came out in the same year, which makes it GOTY. Sad that it didn't make enough money to keep the devs in business. AAA games may have to take a rest until they find a business model.			"

												BioShock Infinite is one of those games that you must play before you die, whether you are a fan of the FPS genre or not. The gameplay may be lacking in some parts if you compare it to the previous two titles (BioShock 1 in particular since both 1 and Infinite were made by Irrational), but it still provides a unique experience that you can't find in other shooter games. The story is also compelling enough to keep you interested. The concept of parallel universes, constants and variables can get very confusing down the line, and eventually you'll be left with feelings like ""WTF just happened"". But once you understand it, you can appreciate the story for what it is, and maybe even want more. The two central characters, Booker and Elizabeth, are also very well-designed. Troy Baker and Courtnee Draper's voice acting is top-notch. They really bring the characters to life, leaving a very good impression in the players.All in all, this game deserves to be called a masterpiece. 10/10, no discussion. Thank you Irrational and Ken Levine for making this game. Hope to see more projects from you guys in the future.			"

												Coming from someone who's beaten this game about 3 or 4 times now, with having beaten it very recently, I can definitely give this game two thumbs up from me! BioShock Infinite serves as an excellent addition to the BioShock franchise and if I must say, has become my favorite game of the series. It's a game that has an excellent story, interesting and loveable characters, amazing settings, and more. With the previous two games having both taken place in the underwater city of Rapture, it's nice to see this game take a departure from there and instead, having it take place a completely brand new, different setting, which is the floating city of Columbia. I also enjoyed the game's soundtrack and as well, was taken in by the graphics of the game. It isn't the top of the line realism graphics, but graphics that I find to be quite beautiful. And then there's Elizabeth! She has to be one of my favorite companions of any game. I could honestly go on about her for ages, but in short, she's a character I easily grew to love and who has a very interesting personality, as well as backstory. As well, a companion who is actually seems real as opposed to a not so smart AI. One of my favorite things of this game though is that the city of Columbia as a whole and it's people, as well as so much of the game taking place in bright settings like outside and such, at first glance, it seems like one of those bright, positive games. While this game does have it's brighter, cheerful moments, underneath all that, at the core, I believe BioShock Infinite to be a darker game, when you consider certain parts of the storyline and such, especially when delving deep into the story. Overall, I've had loads of fun playing this game and think it to be a masterpiece of a game, if I do say so myself. I'd recommend this game to anyone without second thoughts!			"

												I want to love this game, but it just doesn't seem to like me. Unfortunately, I don't think this game plays well on all hardware setups. I have yet to get more than 30 minutes into this game before it decides it wants to crash on me. Highly dissapointing. There seems to be a small percentage of gamers who are having this issue, but if you aren't the unlucky few then I am sure this is a really fun game. The sad part is, even though gamers report these huge problems, they don't seem to ever get fixed. Some people have been waiting since release for a fix and still nothing. If anything I will think twice before buying something from this company again. It's really sad because the game looks so good.			"

												Picked this up on Steam sale with Bioshock 1 and 2. First of all why get rid of when you can save? That instantly gets minus 50 points on my scale of game play ability. O look your game crashed please redo the game from the start.  O look you have a known graphics glitch happen go back 3 hours. O look another crash 2 hours gone. Secondly minus 20 points lack of telling you you are leaving a section of an area and can't back track.  Third minus 30 points unable to have more than 2 weapons, upgrades too expensive, lack of 'tonic' choices like the first two.   This game gets a 10 out of 100 from me and that is me being generous. I also have a high end computer so it is not my PC that is the issue. This game is buggy as all hell and too much 'first person shooter in a hallway for my liking. ' Thankfully Bioshock 1 and 2 made up for the awesome series or I would have felt very ripped off.			"

												As rich as the Rapture environement was in the first two installments, Columbia is even more so. Interacting with the NPC's feels natural almost to the point of being creepy. There is a ""Stepford"" feel to the citizens of Columbia. You can tell that they would do whatever their Prophet asked without hesitation which left me with a sense of uneasiness that I had only felt in games like Quake. Great replay value too.

												Never has a game touched my emotions as much as this bioshock has. Had me since the very start and left wanting even more at the very end, so much so that I might even replay it a couple of times more. Beautiful ending, amazing visuals, goodbye elizabeth and dewitt.If only there was a way I could forget this game so I could experience playing it once again.			"

												I just finished the last DLC of this game (Burial at Sea Episode 2), and I'm just blown away by this amazing work of art.This game is simply amazing. There will be spoilers ahead for anyone who hasn't played this yet. Story ----------------------------------Bioshock Infinite's story is possibly one of the most complex stories that I've ever encountered in a game. The whole concept of infinite universes and 'constants and variables' is an ever present theme throughout the series. After completing the base game, I was left with a few questions, but the two follow-up DLCs: Burial at Sea 1 & 2, gave me such an emotional and satisfying ending that I was left with no ill-feelings. I'll just say straight up that if you love a good story, which is so massive and complex, yet understandable, this game is perfect for you. Gameplay ----------------------------------Bioshock Infinite has some very enjoyable gameplay. Combining FPS, with rapid skylines, and vigors (special abilities), makes this game mind blowingly awesome. Every shot, every power, feels impactful. The visual detail is stunning for a game which has an almost 'cartoony' feel to it. Riding skylines, and hopping from location to location feels amazing and action-filled as you quickly hop off to take down an enemy, only to run back and swing along looking for your next target. For the more tactical players, setting off vigor traps, or possessing enemy structures can turn the tide of battle in an instant. The weapons....oh man the weapons. The time period of this game brings back all the 'old-school' weapons which have a certain kind of feel to them which can't be explained. The detail of the gun models, the sounds, the firing rate, and the damage it inflicts just gives a satisfying feeling at the end of a battle. There are all kinds of weapons for any kind of player. Snipers, pistols, shotguns, grenade launchers, and a ton more. Gameplay wise, this game deserves a playthrough at the very least...but no, there's more...Characters----------------------------------Oh my god, where do I begin?? First off, Elizabeth is possibly the most lovable, attractive, helpful character I've ever seen in a game, period.The voice actors for both Booker, and Elizabeth are simply amazing. They made the characters feel so real, so personal, and the story could not have gone anywhere without top quality voice actors.There's literally paragraphs upon paragraphs I could write about this masterpiece of a game, but no, buy this game and it's DLCs. Play it. Enjoy it. 9.9/10  I wanted Elizabeth to live :'( If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												Picked this up on Steam sale with Bioshock 1 and 2. First of all why get rid of when you can save? That instantly gets minus 50 points on my scale of game play ability. O look your game crashed please redo the game from the start.  O look you have a known graphics glitch happen go back 3 hours. O look another crash 2 hours gone. Secondly minus 20 points lack of telling you you are leaving a section of an area and can't back track.  Third minus 30 points unable to have more than 2 weapons, upgrades too expensive, lack of 'tonic' choices like the first two.   This game gets a 10 out of 100 from me and that is me being generous. I also have a high end computer so it is not my PC that is the issue. This game is buggy as all hell and too much 'first person shooter in a hallway for my liking. ' Thankfully Bioshock 1 and 2 made up for the awesome series or I would have felt very ripped off.			"

												I want to love this game, but it just doesn't seem to like me. Unfortunately, I don't think this game plays well on all hardware setups. I have yet to get more than 30 minutes into this game before it decides it wants to crash on me. Highly dissapointing. There seems to be a small percentage of gamers who are having this issue, but if you aren't the unlucky few then I am sure this is a really fun game. The sad part is, even though gamers report these huge problems, they don't seem to ever get fixed. Some people have been waiting since release for a fix and still nothing. If anything I will think twice before buying something from this company again. It's really sad because the game looks so good.			"

THIS GAME IS A MUST HAVEI remember playing this game this pas summer and my mind was absolutely blown by the story. I'm not going to spoil anything but if you have never played this game and it's on sale, BUY IT. Trust me you will not regrett playing it. It took me about 8 sweet hours to complete the story and that is because i just wanted to do the story, i did not do anything else on the side such as exploring the world. The world is breathtaking. The graphics are 10/10. Runs smooth like butter on my GTX 980 on ultra graphics.Smart AI, Interesting types of enemies, amazing gunplay, fu**ing 10/10 music, etc.. This is just the top of the iceberg, there is so much more to this game and i feel like i can't put some of the things to words.In my 8-9 hours of gameplay i did not see any FPS drops or frozen moments. The game runs at a consistant FPS and never drops. Honestly i don't have any complains about the game. The only thing i would want is being able to carry more than 2 weapons at a time. Thats the only thing honestly and even that is not noticable unless you don't know which guns are the most powerful.Overall 10/10 game would play again "

												★★★★★ - ""Do not miss this game"" PROS:- It has an intelligent narrative, memorable characters and varied enemies- Above everything though is the gameplay, which is fast, fluid and adventurous- Infinite is a vivid experience which will live long in the memory, for its unique and beautiful setting- Easy to go back to for the fun had with its exciting combination of Vigors and shooting mechanics- Best in the trilogyCONS:- DLC holds its price wellVERDICT?Never a dull moment in Columbia.

												Bioshock Infinite is a memorable action game that is somewhat let down by its game mechanics and story.Let get this clear: the world that Bioshock Infinite presents is truly breathtaking as if the creators knew exactly what people had in mind when they imagined a city above the clouds. The city of Columbia is a marvel to look at, and its exploration stays enjoyable until the very end of the game. It is a breathing, living world that really makes this game remarkable and for this reason alone I recommend getting the game and playing through it at least once.However, I wish I could say the same things about the gameplay and the story. While the skyrail is a joy to use, the shooting simply does not feel satisfying and the enemies are too bullet-spongy. Even though you gain superhuman powers throughout the course of the game, you simply do not feel powerful.It doesn't help that I played the game on 1999 mode which in itself, is a joke, because there is simply nothing ""1999ish"" about it. Your health regenerates, exploration for ammo and health is very limited, and the checkpoint system also does not improve on the situation. The developers thought they made this mode harder because you can only die a number of times (I'm not sure if I remember this correctly), but you can easily cheat the system if you just reload the checkpoint before the death animation finishes. Sure, you could spam the quicksave-quickload buttons back in 1999, but you still were on the edge of your seat due to conserving ammo and health.(Not to mention the fact that every time you reload the game, the item drops RANDOMIZE. I have no idea who thought this was a good idea. Sure, some bullets or health here and there could vary I guess, but even the gameplay-affecting modifiers too?)The story, while it starts out strong, it gets way too stuck up its own♥♥♥♥♥towards the end of the game. While I enjoy a complex story and even the dimension-jumping element was a good surprise ( I also managed to get around 70 of the audiologs), explaining what the hell happened in the last 5 minutes is not good storytelling. It seems as if the developers had all these crazy ideas what should happen throughout the campaign but ultimately failed to wrap things up nicely.Ultimately, I give this a recommendation because the game really shines in its world-building and atmosphere. If you go in expecting a remarkable if somewhat flawed shooter, you're going to get your money's worth out of Bioshock Infinite.However, if you're a Shock-fan that has played through the System Shocks and the first Bioshock, I recommend waiting for a sale.

												Bioshock Infinite is an OK game. Let’s just put that on the table. This is pretty good. But that whole “the defining game of our generation” crap swirled around in the media by “reviewing” sites such as IGN are wrong. This game is not revolutionary.First off, the game-play. Bioshock Infinites game-play plays disappointingly similar to the original Bioshock, that’s not to say it’s bad, just not very different. Plasmids from Bioshock 1 have been replaced by Vigors which carry slightly different abilities and are taken orally instead of through injection. Some abilities are really fun to play around with, such as Possession, allowing you to take control of nearby enemies and make them fight for you for a brief period. Another good one is Return to Sender, allowing you to blast back damage taken from enemies and absorb attacks. It seems however, all other 6 Vigors are just means to either straight up damage your enemies, or disable them for a short time to allow you to shoot them. You tend to pick two or three Vigors you like using (for me it was Shock Jocky, Possesion and Bucking Bronco) while all the others are sort of just forgotten about. However, playing on harder difficulty mode does sort of force you to use other Vigors to get little creative. Another thing I found strange was that some of the Vigors, namely Undertow and Return to Sender are only entered into the game in the last few hours, leaving no really chance to get a feel for them.Gun-play is solid; each gun feeling like it has strong differences to the others the others, allowing you to choose which is best for you. However, the upgrade system for the guns is really poor. They basically give damage bonuses, recoil reduction and increased clip size in exchange for in-game currency. No form of attachments or customizations on the guns at all, which while not really necessary, would have been nice.The soundtrack, visuals and voice acting are all exquisite, couldn’t really fault them if I tried. I played this back on my old PC at low Graphics and game still looks amazing.Now, the story. If you're interested enough to play the game, stop reading here, just to avoid any minor spoilers.It is to me at least, decently executed and fits into the feel of the game. All the characters are well-written, especially Elizabeth, whose backstory and mysterious powers is the most interesting aspect of the story. The point when the plot becomes controversial however is the end. There is a huge plot twist that is hinted slightly throughout the game but never really realised until the end that will leave many people a little dumb-founded. Some people love this shock factor in media. That said, while being starling, it is by no means original, it’s be done before and been done better. Regardless, the game is still executed well and the story is of enough credit enough to warrant a play-through.Don’t believe the hype of this game, it is, like all other hyped games, nowhere near as good as people say it is. But don’t let stop you from playing.			"

												""Booker, are you afraid of God?""Amazing Game.Pros:1.Beautiful stage and world design.2.Good gameplay mechanics, the 8 Vigors available in the game can set you up for fun and creative combos.3.Pacing is where it needs to be, the game doesn't rush you nor does it stay in one place for too long.4.Story and character development is amazing, even the supporting cast is made of great characters.5.The game doesn't hold your hands through the game like most titles these days, some things in the game you learn to do by yourself.6.The optional side quest/puzzles are actually really fun, they aren't those boring 'fetch quest' that most games are plague with.7.Elizabeth's AI is really good and very helpful, expect when you have to go through tight hallways and corridors.8.Magical ******9.Skylines, need I say why?Cons:1.More than likely you will find several bugs on your playthrough, but non of them are gamebreaking though.2.Too easy, of course that depends on your play style. Play on hard to really experience the full potential of the game. Play on lower difficulty if you'd like to rush.3.Plots and how the world works might be hard for some people to understand, especially if you rush through it.4.Linear world, I haven't played the first two games so I don't know how they compare. Columbia is beautiful and breathtaking world. I just want to explore every nook and cranny of it.5.Lack of skylines and places to use the hook, I want more please.The Cons Can't Pull the Pros Down, even with all this little thing, this game is an almost imperfect piece of art. The message the world tries to convey is really touching.Note:This is a story driven game so if you don't have the patience 'play' the game or just have a short attention span then you will be left very confused by the end of the game. offtopic: Throughout my game I dunno why but I kept calling Elizabeth Emily and Booker, Corvor.""One man goes into the waters of baptism. A different man comes out, born again. But who is that man who lies submerged? Perhaps that swimmer is both sinner and saint until he is revealed onto the eyes of man."" - Zachary Hale Comstock			"

												I got it when it was $7.50 (the price one buys a game at influences their perception of it). I played it once through on hard difficulty, which took 11 hours for one playthrough. So keep that in mind for this review.Well, definitely great graphics wise. Combat feels fluid and fun, though since I played on hard I spent much of my time hiding and taking potshots at enemies. Plot is overall great for a video game, though there are a few inconsistencies that are present within the plot that is provided to you (which you can wave your hand at and still enjoy the game).The vigor system is more fun to mess with than in Bioshock; the upgraded 8th vigor is insanely good. The enemies you face are relatively smart and challenging (that siren boss killed me 20 times in a row before randomly dying (I was hiding behind a building, and suddenly she died without me doing anything)).I'd have to give it a 9.5/10. In all areas it was good, but it felt a tad short and not all that replayable (to me).			"

												A worthy successor of the first Bioshock, and at the same time a very different experience. Gameplay is impressive, skylines add even more tactics and shooting mechanics are solid. Enemy's DI is only mediocre, but lets not forget Elizabeth. She is not only interesting, living person, but she also helpful in combat. The story is there game really shines, it's really deep and combined with excellent voice acting creates an amazing atmosphere. Columbia, city in the sky, looks believable with unique visual style. And lastly, the music which simply leaves you breathless in many epic moments. 1999 difficulty is not too hard and I recommend it for a second playthough.Overall, Bioshock Infinite is my second favorite game in 2013 (close to The Last of Us).ReDiR's rating: 9.5/10			"

												Rating 9/10Overview: First Person ShooterThe Good:+ As is the case with every Bioshock game proceeding this one, the world, setting and atmosphere is the main attraction and this game is no different. The city of Columbia is beautiful and one of the most interesting and unique game settings to play in. + Graphically both artistically and technically this game is gorgeous. Easily one of the best looking games on PC to date. + The story is fantastic dealing with major themes such as racism, morality, religion and faith. A game that should leave a lasting impression on you long after you finish it. + Elizabeth one of the main NPC's is incredibly helpful in and out of combat, providing you with health, ammo, money etc. The developers did a great job making her realistic and helpful and not a hindrance.  + The game introduces vigors (identical to plasmids from previous Bioshock games) that give you special powers such as charging enemies, shocking, possessing etc that give you an advantage in combat.+ Plenty of weapons/vigors to fit your play style. You can charge in and blast your enemies with shotguns or stay back and snipe with a sniper rifle. + The game introduces skylines for you to ride on adding an extra gameplay element to combat. You can jump on and off the the skylines at will to either attack enemies from above or to escape a potentially dangerous situation. +The three pieces of DLC are very enjoyable. Clashes in the Clouds is a horde mode across 4 levels and 15 waves each. The goal obviously is to survive each wave and if possible complete the bonus objective. Burial at Sea part 1 and 2 tie in the story of Infinite with the events of the first game. Although the story may be a bit contrived in doing so it was still nice to revisit Rapture from a different point of view. Each episode introduces some new gameplay elements. The first episode being more action oriented while the second being more stealth oriented. + Great music and soundAverage- Other than the inclusion of skylines the gunplay introduces nothing new. You can also only carry 2 weapons at one time which feels very limiting compared to the previous games. - Throughout the game you will find pieces of equipment for you to wear. You can equip a total of 4 pieces. The problem is the vast majority of equipment you find is terrible and offers little to no value. The few that are good can really break the game. There is no balance. -The last gameplay segment is uninspiring. I got the feeling the developers ran out of time/creative ideas.ConclusionYou really have to love the world, story and characters to really appreciate this game. If you play it solely for the gameplay you may find yourself a tad disappointed. I personally loved the game I only wish the world was more open ended for me to explore at my own pace. "

												Bioshock Infinite is easily one of the greatest games I've had the pleasure of playing.Graphically, it ushers in a new standard for the PC. Set in a backdrop of a 1930s city, the environment is vibrant and colorful, but not distracting towards gameplay, although the same cannot be said for the heroine Elizabeth ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). The textures and intricate details put into the surroundings and characters allow for a spectacularly immersive experience, all the while being well optimised and running smoothly for most mid to high end computers.Just like its predecessors, the storyline for Bioshock Infinite is fairly dark. This certainly does not seem to be the case at first when you enter the idyllic, utopian city in the sky that is Coloumbia–it appears nothing like the dingy underwater city of Rapture in the past two games. However it soon becomes evident that there is much more than meets the eye.Instead of the generic, faceless protagonist in many FPS games, you play as Booker Dewitt, a man with his own agenda, motivations...and regrets. Tasked with retrieving a girl named Elizabeth from the city of Coloumbia, the two develop a complicated bond as they rely upon and learn about each other in their bid to escape from Coloumbia. There is very strong character development in both Booker and Elizabeth as the story progresses, on par with a well-written novel. The plot also progresses at a enjoyable pace with many twists along the way. Although the story is linear, there are moral choices that the player has to make along the way, and you are constantly reminded of that choice for the rest of the game. Despite several plot holes, the story was one of the best I have experienced for a video game, to the extent that I feel that the game would have remained a masterpiece even if combat gameplay was removed and it was made into a visual novel with the same cutscenes.Therein lies the only mediocre aspect of Bioshock Infinite: the actual combat. Although there are some fairly innovative features, such as shooting while moving along aerial rails at high speed, much of the FPS elements fail to leave a big impression. The weapons and abilities that you can use feel largely similar, just as most of the enemies that you fight. There seems to be little variation in tactics involved, the player simply guns baddies down from one area to the next. This is further limited by the fact that you can only have 2 weapons and 2 active abilities at a time. Combat is also hardly challenging with little disincentive to dying. On death the player respawns at the location, with only the surviving enemies from the past engagement healed–already killed enemies do not respawn. This means that you could just slowly try to kill an enemy one at a time before dying if you are having difficulty in a fight, rinse and repeat until you manage to clear it.Despite these drawbacks, I feel that Bioshock Infinite has redefined videogames and the FPS genre as a storytelling medium, and I certainly look forward to replaying it again. (In fact, this lengthy review was written in a bid to stave off that feeling of dejection that one gets after clearing a really good game/book. I hope that stands as a testament to how brilliant this game is.)10/10			"

												I really can't find any words for tims game... I just ended the game like 2 minutes ago and all I can think abuot is one big ""WTF?!"". My brain just gone crazy so sorry if it will be... Chaotic.Story: 11/10I just can't find any game, ANY, that was pulling me more and more to play like this. I was just in needed to find what's more about Elizabeth and Comstock and just everything. There was not any single think that I dislike in story and how it gone.Music: 10/10Really nice, really climatic, really standing in mind. Graphic: 11/10Breath taking. Perfect. Wonderful. Whole scenery was climatic and was having so many details. Even if my comupers was allowing me to play on worst and the lowest options ever, everything was still looking very amazing. Sometimes I was wpending few minutes on just looking around me because I was so amazed by Columbia, whole BioShock Infinite world.Elizabeth: 11/10If some of you check my profile, you cen se that i took many... Oh boy, really many pictures of her. She took my heart first time when i saw her. She's just perfect in way that she looks, talks, and just is - she's the most usefull character in gaming world.All: ∞/10This game... This game... I still can'd find words in my head. If you thinking about buying this game, I have an answer - buy it. Buy it and spend few next hours of your life on making it to the end! :D			"

A lighthouse, a cryptic message, and an impossible city. The stage is set for another adventure through the grim, but surprisingly sunny, world of Bioshock. The original Bioshock is a landmark in immersive videogame narrative and incredible design. It combined wonderfully designed aestethics with cool gameplay elements and a nice story to boot. For those who were truly interested there was plenty of room to explore and learn more of the fallen city of Rapture. Infinite then had a lot to live up to.Infinite takes you to the flying city of Columbia, a seceded state from early America that left the blasphemous world below behind to ascend to a plane closer to god. You're former private eye with a checkered past who is hired to retrieve a girl from this flying utopia. How hard can it be?Plenty hard. As it turns out, you're expected, and they're not happy. Inifite has you duke it out in the streets of Columbia while listening to the zealous chants of radical prophets and out of control rebels. The atmosphere is piled on at every turn and the game spares no expense to show you new and crazier things than you held possible. It is an exercise in world building of the highest order that adresses social, racial and religious themes to make you, the player, contemplate your actions and you make your way through the game. However, for all the grandeur and splendor found in its presentation, the execution leaves something to be desired. Do not misunderstand, the story unfolds perfectly and you're still given room to explore. The problem is in the gameplay. Infinite borrows much of its combat from the original Bioshock, but trims away a lot of the fat and only leaves a bare bones set of options. Most battles revolve around bullet pumping and a bit of power flailing, while the combat systems in Bioshock 2 introduced so many cool things. This is Infinite's main problem. After a few hours, the sun doesn't shine so bright anymore while you stride into another gunfight. Luckily, Infinite spares no expense to keep the pace up so you can make your way through the story at a proper pace. This makes it a game to be enjoyed for its content, while it skimps a bit on the gameplay. That said, if you fancy yourself a masochist, feel free to dive into the 1999 mode. A super hard mode that leaves you reeling if you don't prepare. That'll keep you occupied for a while. Still, Bioshock Infinite is an experience you will need to try at least once.			"

												This is a good game on it's own. But compared to the original Bioshock and System Shock it is crap. As far as a Shock game i was very dissapointed even though I played through it twise (one time on 1999 mode, hoping for a bit of the old feel, but no).While Bishock and Systemshock feelt ""real"" and dynamic in a way few games do, Infinite feels more like a bland rail shooter. It is not really a shock game anymore, you don't even have a map! (because you don't need one in this ""corridor"" shooter!) And while the splicers in the original Bioshock feelt very thoughtout and fitting to the setting, they just copied them to what is supposed to be regular humans in Infinite, taking another well thought out game setting and turning it totally unlogical. In Bioshock, crazy splicers jumping at you in frenzy make total sense. In Infinte regular policemen doing the same, not so much. They had the good sense to not involve nps:s in the first Shock games to much, in Infinte again, they just screw it up with populating the world in some areas with these ""robots"", just taking away from the feeling this is a real place. The best things about the game are Elizabeth as a character and as an AI. Very impressive. Also the story is interesting, but not as involving as in the original Bioshock.Juding this as a stand alone game with nothing to do with the Shock series I would say it is a good game and give this a honest 7-8/10As a Shock game it is a huge dissappointment : 3/10			"

Weak feeling weapons and spongey enemies ruin the series, and I don't find plasmids or salts to be any more than renamed spells from other, REAL RPGs.I recommend watching an entire lets play of this game to get the story, but i wouldn't buy it to play it			"

												I have to say three good things about Bioshock Infinite: it's visually gorgeous, it's very clever in terms of ambient storytelling and Elizabeth is a great charachter. But that's it... there's not a lot to say about the rest: the relation with Elizabeth was the only reason I finished the game. Problem is: just like the rest of the series, the good aspects are only  a nice dress for a linear shooting experience. Story and gameplay don't even try to reconcile and there's nothing substantial about the backstory and its ""philosophy"". It's just a convoluted excuse to blow heads off with guns and magic: the gameplay has been dumbed down for the casual crowd when compared to Bioshock 1 & 2. There's no survival or rpg-lite element. Just... shooting. The story does not make any kind of sense, but that's a given for the Bioshock series. Overall, Infinite is one of the most overrated game I ever played. Vote: 5,5			"

												This game has quite nice art/graphics. That's the only good thing I can say that did right. The gameplay is so ♥♥♥♥ing boring. Not even ""bad"", just boring. Wave of enemies come, you shot them, they drop, maybe if you are  feeling creative you can use the sky rail, but even those get boring after some hours playing this game. The vigors could be used to add more depth, but mostly all of them are just some sort of stun(so it's easier to shot your enemies!) and even the ones that aren't, are completely non-relevant to the game.Story wise, it's a really letdown. It introduces nice themes early, just to be dropped two hours later, with convoluted and shallow plot twists. Soundtrack is okay, but quite forgettable. Can't really recommend this for anyone, if you want story-driven FPS games, there's way better ones out there, like Deus Ex, Half-Life and even the first Bioshock.			"

												I know its kinda weird to write this review. first of all i've got no hours recorded on steam, second one, its already late cause it was released two years ago.but **** it i love this game. in fact i already finished it on ps3 and on pc with ""another"" versionyeah this game is remarkable, the city of colombia is so beautiful, atmospheric and mesmerizing, the setting and art style are so unique, the gameplay with combinations of arms, sky-lines and vigor is so awesome (yeah this is my first game on bioshock series).icing on the cake is the story, the story of bioshock are so unforgettable its like watching a great movie, the feeling and emotions its so real. the issues of patriotism, nationalism, racism, and religion was brought so well.you will love all the characters in this game especially the lovely Elizabeth. its like you have the bond between you as the main character (booker) with elizabeth and you understand what's her feeling and have to protect her at all cost.The best part of this game is the end of story. you're gonna be mind****** in the end. if you love some sci-fi movie like donnie darko, predestination etc, well you're gonna love this one too. the story has stirred me speechless and after i finished this game i cant stop thinking about it.This game absolutely my favorite. so thats why im bought this game (probably because it was discounted) just to write this review after such a long time. 9/10			"

												It's undeniable that the first Bioshock has advanced the narrative in this medium quite a bit, and Infinite is just another step in the right direction. Of course you get the amazing narrative you'd expect; Elizabeth is one of the best companions in gaming. The developers took their time in developing her character and build the relationship between her & Booker. A character of this quality has not been done since Half Life 2, and even then the comparison falls in Infinite's favor.The level design is another standout. The addition of the skyline was ingenious as it allowed the developers to open up the map in a way where it complimented the setting of a city in space.Superpowers, now called vigors instead of plasmids, allows the player to mix a match their play style. There's a decent selection of vigors that allows the player to experiment with certain combos and leads to some replay value. Some of the returning powers from the old game have been streamlined to allow for easier management. For example, instead of having to switch between enemy specific plasmids, the power of possession now encompasses all enemies. This aids the somewhat clumsy interface that plagued the first game.There is simply no other game like Infinite at the moment. It is frankly one of the most memorable games I've ever had the luxury of playing. Thanks to the superb narrative and game design, Infinite will sit in my mind for days to come.			"

												Bioshock Infinite is not a game about Christian fundamentalism or race relations or political extremism or expansionist wars. There’s a little bit of all of those things but not enough to be meaningful or interesting. It’s rather belittling to the seriousness of the topics that are invoked that nothing is ever done with them. I endured the entirety of this game not caring about anything that happened.Separate Bioshock Infinite from Ken Levine and Bioshock, and technically it is a fine game. Everything functions properly. Voice acting is OK. Little details in zones means there’s something cute around every corner. But these sorts of things don’t make a game a masterpiece. It just means the devs had the time and money.On top of the muddled storytelling is the rather lackluster ending that gives the impression Levine simply tried to dress up what was already a terrible, half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥idea with pretentious intellectualism.I wish I had played the game everyone else seems to be raving about.

The DLC in particular is a love story to the orginal Bioshock game. It ties together all the loose ends between Bioshock 1 and Infinite forming a complete story between the two. The joining of Bioshock 1 and Infinite were masterful with a fantastic ending. The DLC is a must play if you loved Bioshock.			"

												After playing this game numerous times (once on Normal, once on 1999) I can safely say it's one of the best stories of all time. The game, however, sucks.Lemmie explain. In the original Bioshock, you had 7 weapons (8 if you include the Camera) that you can carry on you at any given time. This, coupled with the 3 types of ammo for nearly every weapon, allowed you to approach situations and adjust to them as they came. In addition to the interesting weapons, their upgrades were even more fascinating. The ability to freeze somebody by smacking them over the head, then shoot them with fire bullets? Why not?! The possibilites for an interesting combat experience were endless.Bosses in the original also had depth, and were interesting characters. You knew them, you saw what they'd done, you'd heard their words, and agreed with why they must die for you to continue onwards. They also had a habbit for knowing when it was high time to fall over, meaning, after their primary mechanic was exploited, their minutes quickly became numbered, creating a fast paced, difficult, non mundane boss fighting experience. It wasn't just the bosses that died without a ridiculous amount of bullets being pumped into their face, regular enemies didn't take half a nuclear arsenal to bring down, and with good reason; they were just drug heads in t-shirts with the occasional power. Nothing more.My apologies for ranting, but there's a point to this. The reason I mentioned the previous two things in those long drawn out excuses for paragraphs it to show what Infinite is lacking. You can hold a maximum of two weapons (the melee weapon now passively always being attached) and thus decreasing the possible methods of dealing with an issue by an exponentional amount. The upgrades for weapons in Infinite are also a joke, being the standard ""Reduced Recoil, Increase Damage, Increase Ammo Capacity"". That is boring. This is why I mark off the weapon system as terrible.The second thing to complain about in this game is the combat sections (if they can even be called that). Interesting locations and cool locales taken thrown headfirst into a game of ""Who can be the biggest bullet sponge."" The enemies act with a reckless disregard for their own safety and recieve no penalty for it because they can take more hits than an IS-2 tank. It's not interesting fighting enemies who can run up to you and tank all the damage and just punch you in the face. The mess of a combat system quickly becomes a chore when you realize who Ken Levine called in when the bosses all called in sick: Handymen, a dude on fire, and a Spooky Scary Ghost. The Handymen might quite possibly be the worst enemy I have ever faced in a game (besides of course the Lopers from Return to Castle Wolfenstein). They're not enemies so much as they're trucks that can fly. They take a ridiculous amount of punishment and just don't die after being hit in the ""Weak Spot"" at least 20 times by 12 guage slugs. You also need to fight them every 10 or so minutes, so you spend 1/3 of the game playing and about 2/3s fighting these fun champs, who quickly lose appeal after the first encounter. Now onto the good part: The story. Horrible combat aside, Bioshock Infinite is a must buy. The enviroments are diverse and feel real and full of life (until you start shooting but hey then it's full of Up-Till-Recently life), the big enemies/friends you encounter all feel like part of something much bigger than yourself, and the story itself and watching Columbia fall apart is absolutely golden and shouldn't be missed.An 9/10 story coupled with 3/10 gameplay could easily total to a solid 7.5 game. Highly recommend. "

												The short: Starts out kinda slow, but it's a great alternate world of the Guilded Age that's achingly beautiful to play in. The shooting mechanic is fun but generic, as is the spellcasting/Vigors powers which is a little dissappointing. This is all secondary towards the story telling which is excellently voiced and written, though pacing in the beginning needs work. There are plot holes (the ending, the mother story thread, etc) and jarring game mechanics (Elizabeth's powers) but nothing preventing you from wanting  to see how this all unveils. For all my quibbles, it's smoothed out with the charming characters and world that Infinite presents.The Long:After 2 hours in to Infinite, I stopped playing this game. I felt bored, and as pretty as the world was presented in this wonderous alternate steam-punk reality of a cotton candied 1910-esque US, it just wasn't enought to keep me interested because I've seen this theme many times in lower detail and quality, and after 10 minutes wondering around, it all felt familiar. The clever plot points were slipped in from early on, but a bit too obvious and/or heavy handedly but at least a good attempt was made.  The gun play is typical, movement was typical, vigors/spells were unique enough but nothing unheard of. And that's when I stopped. The story was being too subtle, especially for a player like me, who wants to see all places presented, thus making the story even slower.  After some nudging from friends, I booted it back on and trudged forward. Once you meet Elizabeth, everything this world and story was building upon started to click. Factions, trials, wonders, backstory, expositories, trageties, horrors, betrayals and tender moments all come at you like a torrential storm surge, each trying to overwhelm the other in waves. Weirdly, through this maelstrom of motivations and hatched plots, the characters and why the world is the way it is, was and/or to be all make some semblance of sense, albeit broken sense if you're not caught up in the spectical/revelation and think about it a bit. The voice acting and dialog is wonderful and believable, there is chemistry between Booker and Elisabeth in their voicing and 3D depictions. You get the sense of balance between tragedy and resilience from Elisabeth, while Booker is definately a man with a past and skin he's not comfortable in anymore.The ending... I'll let you be the judge due to the nature of it. It's definitely you take what you will with it since there really isn't a proper answer besides speculation to be honest. The one the game presents is possible but flawed in my mind, but given the game's title, who am I to really judge? Play it and see if you choose to believe it as it is one of the infinite possibilities.			"

												Trying to keep this spoiler free.....I both recommend and don't recommend this game. The main issue I had was I got all 3 Bioshocks, never played them until now, so I ran through all 3 of them and Infinite is clearly the weak link and it's really not a Bioshock game.... The first 2 create this atmosphere and semi suspenseful style of gameplay. Creeping around this dark ruined city under the ocean filled with psychos and genetic freaks. You can hear them shouting their crazy phrases and your sitting there wondering ""Where the hell are they?!"". Every time you encounter a Big Daddy instantly what came to my mind was ""Awwww ♥♥♥♥♥t. Here we go!"". But in Infinite honestly it was NOTHING like the older games. Your wandering around a bright city killing random soldiers and every day people. Nothings even remotely suspenseful or similar to the first 2 games in any way shape or form. There are no Big roaming sort of bosses like in the first 2 with Big Daddies. It's basically just arena gameplay which I never played Call of Duty but it definitely felt like a generic shooter. Just run into an area and start shooting. You can clearly see they lost any element of suspense with the ridiculous introduction of a damn shield. That completely ruins any aspect of surprise because if someone catches me off guard who cares..... It didn't break through my shield and actually hurt me. What's worse is everythings shared through just generic money. Want to upgrade your powers? Use money..... Want to upgrade that weapon? Use money. Non of the upgrades ever had any actual impact on your weapons appearance like the old games. I found it hillarious using a double chamber revolver shotgun in the old ones that totes electricity through the chambers. This one you can't even hold more than 2 weapons. So why would I even care about these weapons which I'm going to have to keep swapping in and out? I can choose a favorite but this area calls for a Sniper rifle so I have to ditch one of my favorites and oh look Elizabeth tossed me a sniper rifle. I can rant forever but it's just.... .... not Bioshock. The story tries to be clever and almost mirror the events of the first game in a vague sense. But the story is just generic and kind of pretentious.			"

												For me, BioShock Infinite was sometimes fun, mostly not so. The art design is certainly fantastic, with most praise reserved for the first act. After that, there isn’t much worth looking at. The gameplay as stated is largely the same as the original only with a diminished progression system and the weaknesses in the original’s mechanics are exposed by the frequent intense combat. I hesitate to use the word “overrated” due to how frequently it is misused but I wouldn’t be surprised if this is an adjective commonly associated (and not unreasonably) with BioShock Infinite in the near future.*From an original review on Another-Castle.com "

												WOW what can i say, this game is a superb follow on from the previous games, and if you havnt played any of them then this is still amazing, this has to be one of my favourites of 2013 and would recommend this to everyone.Its an old fasioned steampunk style world, with amazing scenery and graphics, all high up in the clouds.Its a first person action shooter with your basic but cool weapons and magic, that will lock you in for hours of gameplay (atleast 15hrs).Controls are simple to use and easy to adjust if required, and the gameplay is wonderful, really entertaining and enjoyable and ive found no problems so far.DLC is great too, both are short but both are great, quality not quantity as they say.Buy it! you wont regret it.

												The game had a nice intro, and cool concept. However, as you play, you will start to notice how shallow the game is. Environments dont respond to you, NPCs dont respond to you, and you feel like the game has no soul. The flying city did not feel like a flying city. You spend most of the time in rooms and hallways. You get a few chances to take to the clouds, but I really wished there was more emphasis on living in the sky and was hoping for more air fights. At many points in turns into a call of duty duck and cover til you win strategy type of game. The combat gets boring, the vigors get boring, the 'boss battle' is freaking rediculous - but with a great ending - I still felt somewhat satisfied and happy to have played it. If this game were a movie, Id suggest waiting to catch it on TV.			"

												Recent convo with a dear friend with questionable taste made me want to go a bit more in depth on why I have a problem with this game. Forgive my ranting, derivitive wording, and sloppy editing. Ill probably do something about that at some point in the future.Allosaurus Rex, a youtuber I quite respect, described interactive media as running on parallel lines of narrative devices and player interaction; A games predetermined narrative, the players input into the interactive gamespace, and how those two lines influence each other. If the parallel runs properly, then player input should serve as a narrative device on its own, even in a mechanically linear game. Take for example Hotline Miami, its usage of neon psychedelia and bass thumping combat queues to reinforce the players disconnect from the games violence, and binding it to the player characters own disconnect. The game uses its interactivity to reinforce the narrative and connect the player and character headspaces; The gameplay means the same to the player what the actions its portraying mean to the character. The narrative flows and the gameplay flows with it. The core thematic and narrative concept of Bioshock Infinite, as is traditional of the franchise, is the father-child relationship of the protaganist's filtered through a lens of idealistic extremism, with Randian Objectivism replaced as the focus of satire with colonial American Nationalism. The Father-Child of the story being the player character Booker and his ward Elizabeth. The scripted narrative wants us to feel connected to and ultimately protective of this ward, as the authorities want her back under their control. Protect Elizabeth, that’s the narrative line. The game itself is a linear shooter. Once combat, the gameplay proper, kicks in Elizabeth recedes to the background, immune to damage and only interacting with the player to interrupt the flow of combat to spoon-feed them health and ammo, completely ignored by enemies. That’s the player line. The parallel is obviously not well maintained. A narrative focusing entirely on a cast of two characters and their interactions and how Booker, the vehicle for the player to experience and connect to this story, grows connected to Elizabeth cannot subsist on script alone, something mechanical, something involving the player, needs to be established for that relationship to mean anything. A character as critical to the scripted narrative as Elizabeth cannot be a non-entity in gameplay. Even the excessivity of the violence becomes jarring in the games narrative context. In the original Bioshock the body count made sense within the games world; Jack was engineered to take and dole out damage, and the mentally unstable enemies made suspension of disbelief for their behavior easy, but in Infinite there’s no real logical reason that arguably rational people would be so happy to zerg rush a killing machine like Booker. Going even more basic than that, its a failure. One of the first (ultimately pointless) moral choices the player is confronted with is a pseudo-lynching of an inter-racial couple that the player is forced to participate in. You are given a ball and told to throw it at the couple. At its most basic level, a shooter requires two forms of input: aim and shoot projectiles. So when given a projectile and a target to aim at, of ♥♥♥♥ing course you make the choice with button prompts. Instead of letting the player choose this on their own, potentially letting the setting influence the choice as the pressure of the moment is on them, its reduced to binary hand holding. Without a mechanical factor to bridge the gap between player gameplay and character action, you stop being able to connect to the story as a factor in it and just become a spectator to it. You’re just shooting♥♥♥♥♥♥ and that is a criminal waste of potential in an interactive medium. Its a sloppiness that persists even to the scripted narrative alone. Its heavily praised usage of themes like racial inequality and nationalism are barely present. Compared to real-world racism in real-world America at the time, what goes down in Columbia is tame. Barely any mention of abuse, either physical or verbal, of the black and irish underclass is present in the dialogue. And by the half-way point these ostensibly critical aspects of the game world are thrown out the window for a nonsensical many-worlds plotline that ultimately devolves into the most basic of grandfather paradoxes that uses quantum mechanics as a synonym for magic.Instead of solving the core issues with the concepts presented, like escort missions or enemy AI, the developers over-simplified or cut it out to the detriment of the narrative as a whole. This is a pretty consistent issue; The vigors are a glaring leftover from the Rapture setting. They make no sense in the context of Columbia and its culture, and even in gameplay terms they quickly become redundant to the player, as half of your vigors overlap in use. Even the shooting mechanics end up inconsistent and frustrating. A game with a two weapon limit has no business having a weapon upgrade system. Ammo will never be consistent enough for the player to keep their favored weapons, and the curve of weapon introduction insures that at several critical moments of the game the player is left with un-upgraded weaponry as their only valid option. It limits your arsenal, disrupts its own upgrade system, and leaves the player to deal with its schizophrenic ammo drop system where enemies most of the time drop ammo for weapons that you don’t have and can’t get. TL;DR This game is a pretentious, badly designed mess. For all its praised as being this fresh innovative piece or art, its just another sloppy shooter with a bad story in an industry over-poluted with sloppy shooters with bad stories.			"

Posted: December 7, 2013
												This game is heralded as the second coming of Jesus by many. Is it?Well, no. It's possibly not onlt one of the most overrated games of all time, but probably one of the most boring AAA first person shooters ever released to boot.The one thing the game has going for it is its phenominal art direction. This is promply ruined by some utterly hillarious character models, props and textures that look like something out of Quake 2. Who needs feet on a cahracter when you can just have flesh coloured matchboxes? Who needs barrels of fruit at a market when you can just have a low resolution texture of fruit put over a polygonal surface? And on top of all this it runs like absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥ even on a relatively beefy rig like mine.Now, what about the gameplay? The grand irony of Bioshock Infinite is that it's heralded as a renaissance from all of those dumb, brainless corridor shooters spat out by big publishers for 12 year old boys, but is in reality unfathomably linear and brainless; more-so than the likes of COD. Enemies are brainless, incompletent bullet sponges who charge toward you like wooden targets for you to effortlessly mow down with your weedy, unsatisfying, royal-free sound effect guns. You might remember the original Bioshock for its ferocious and desperate combat. You won't find that here. You might also remember the brilliant plasmids from Bioshock and the variety they brought to the game. You won't find that here. Well, the plasmids are back (why a society of racial puritans would even think of permanently desecrating their bodies I'll never know (the secret society of crow people being a hillariously bad example which the game never explains)), but I'm not exagerating when I say they all do the exact same thing, just with different, console grade eye candy. One click to stun someone (with an easy instakill if you headshot him), or hold it for a trap (which is useless given the AI). Upgrades all consist of having said effect spread to multiple enemies. You'll probably only ever find yourself using the lightning plasmid. In addition to all of this, instead of actually, say, balance and design their levels properly, the vast majority of the game will consist of you being unable to find ammo or items, but your parter tossing conveniently needed items in your direction every five seconds. And if that isn't bad enough, the game effectively eliminates any and all challenge by having absolutely no penalty for death. Yes, that's right, if you die, you just carry on as usual. You'll lose some money, but as you'll soon find it's utterly worthless as there's nothing you can spend it on that won't be pelted in your direction the second you need it.Yet again, this renaissance of the FPS genre is actually even more casualised and patronising than even the dumbest of COD clones. BUT SERIOUSLY, GUYS! IT'S THE GREATEST GAME EVER MADE!The final thing this game is primarily heralded for is its story. It's an emotional and political tour de force! It sets the standards of storytelling for every game that follows it! Well, I can safely say that's complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.The game is set in what is initially an enthralling and interesting universe of what is essentially Utah; an isolantionist state of religious puritans all brought together in their love for their prophet, of whom live in absolute luxury on the backs of slave labour and show utter disdain for whom they view as racially inferior. Eventually all hell breaks loose as the underclass revolts in a bloody civil war against their opressors. All the while you are sent to save a girl for a mysterious unexplained reason from this heavenly hellhole, of whom you then have to save.The universe the game is set in is intially fascinating and deals with what appear to be some great themes; the metamorphasis of religion and government, a post-modernist interpretation of popular revolutions and their fall from grace from the years of hatred the populace has endured. But this is all quickly abandoned in favour of a multiverse plot. Yes. Alternate universes.You skip universes so much in the main story line that you wonder what the point in even being attached to anything going on is, as you're ultimately abandoning it five minutes after you even hear about it. And when it does go back to the themes it was obviously supposed to cover but forgot at the last minute, it does so in the most juvenile, brain dead, shallow manner.OH MY GOD! THEY'RE GOING TO PELT THAT INTERATIAL COUPLE WITH ROTTEN FRUIT!Well, that's quite literally about as far as the game covers racism. Mississipi Burning, this aint.OH MY GOD! THE LEADER OF THE REVOLUTION WANTS TO KILL A KID FOR NO APPARENT REASON! THE HORROR!Animal Farm this isn't.And to top it all off, it ends in possibly the laziest ""OMG SO DEEEEP"" ending imaginable. You may remember Bioshock's (mostly) incredible ending/final act plot twist that revealed you to simply be a puppet of the game and those offering you guidance; both a great narrative plot twist, and a brilliant commentary on our own delusions of free will in what is purported to be a free environment where we make our own descisions, and gamer's general tendency to simply do as they're told because they're told to do it. The ending of this game, however, without spoilers, quite literally amounts to ""what does doing anything even matter any way? You're just gonna die in the end anyway. ♥♥♥♥ it."". Kind of lazy for the Citizen Kane of FPS.Upon criticising the story, you'll likely be criticised for being too stupid to understand its brilliance, at which point the plot in its entirety will be explained to you. The problem is in proping up this game as a literary masterpiece, the fact that its a convoluted, non-sensical, 12 year old's fanfiction of a wreck of a story the fact that it's confusing, or has serious plot holes, or has the political intruige of the graffiti in the sixth form toilets, it's considered as ""ambitious"", or ""deep"", or a ""poltiical commentary"". It's really not any of those. If you find yourself confused at any point, it's not that the story is too complex for you, it's that it's just poorly written, cobbled together tripe.The other grand irony of this game is the way Elizabeth is fawned over as some revolutionary, amazing female role model for video games. It's become incredibly common for pseudo-intellectual third wave feminism to be considered acceptable in gaming journalism (and as a convenient means of demonizing consumers and protecting massive corporations like the one that published this game), but I can't help but find it ironic that THIS character is an incredible female lead, when she's quite literally  a coddled, ignorant and clueless baby (not my criticism, it's a basic plot point of the game), who requires rescuing from a big prison from a big bad man, regardless of the fact SHE CAN BEND TIME AND SPACE TO HER WILL. Outside of the story she's relegated to a useless bumblbing idiot who throws health potions at you and cowers behind cover in combat, only using her incredible powers when you tell her to. Yep, you've never heard a female character being criticsed for being useless for these reasons before, have you?There's an awful lot wrong with this game, and an awful lot wrong with the people who love it so much. Criticising it will often lead you to be swarmed with gaggles of fanboys telling you to ""GO BACK TO COD YOU 12 YEAR OLD!"". It's a shame they're so unaware of themselves that they don't realise that they're playing something with worse gameplay, worse graphics, worse story, and worse replayability than even COD.Perhaps worth it for your own curiousity, but it's far from the second coming of Jesus that the gaming press declares it to be, and it's definitely not worth your time or money if you want a game that's actually competent in the areas a game should be competent in.

												I really enjoyed the first 2 Bioshock games and I was looking for this one to see if Bioshock game can still offer really good gameplay, and a great strory with a great setting. This is why I decided to get the game Day 1 and after reading the reviews I got the idea that it would deliver but after playing the game I was really dissapointed with it as I founded to be the weakest Bioshock game in the series. I will start with the good I would say that the game does look really good, does have some nice areas to explore and it does have an interesting story. However, I realised that the story can become a little bit predictible towards the end as the second half of the game really drags on for quite some time, but it does have a really strong beggining and ending. The story is also riddled with plot holes that really don't make sense once you start thinkinh about it. Then theres the gameplay which the weakest. As for a Bioshock game, the shooting is lackluster and as a FPS it is also lackluster. I have just happened to play better FPS games like Crysis 2 and 3 or FarCry 3, whereas Infinte tries way too hard to be a FPS. The vigors are also pretty useless as you will only find yourself using one or two whereas the rest are not that interesting or fun to use, and the same can be said for the weapons. And finally, the vigor and weapon upgrades are also useless as they don't make your guns or vigors that powerful, no matter how many times you upgrade them. Overall I honestly wouldn't recomend buying Bioshock Infinte but instead go for Bioshock 1 and 2 as they are much better games.			"

												Going to try reviewing this again now that I gave it a fair shot and played it to completion. Long story short: It's still not good in any particular way. It looks and plays rather dated. The game is meanspirited, ugly and not as immersive or intelligent as it likes to pretend it is. Almost everything it does well another game or story does better. Want chaotic shoot and loot gameplay with customizable upgrades with oddly frequent vending machines? Borderlands 2 is all that but non-linear. Want to delve into an immersive dystopia presented in a linear fashion? Try Dishonored. Want trippy pandimensional storytelling that doesn't take itself too seriously? There's a lot of good anime like that, try Steins;Gate. Bioshock Infinite isn't bad but it is mediocre and tiresome, practically presented like a Halo level that threatens to never end. On the plus side, if religious racist political zealots grind your gears the game does serve as a nice anger outlet, but I wouldn't pay more than $15 for the whole thing including DLC. It does have a few neat characers like the Lutece twins that are worth seeing, but they're not enough to salvage the game.			"

												I'm not sure what to make of this.The presentation is very good, the story keeps you going, but there's an enormous amount of inconsistency within the narrative. The game wants to talk about racism but sugar-coats it enormously, to a point that's almost more offensive than the issue it's trying to present. You're ex-military white guy with a gritty voice and dark past #79614, but you have no qualms with killing 600 goons to set the record straight about your guilt.I still liked the game, and if you don't think about the story for more than five seconds you'll like it too... but it's tip-toeing the line between ""recommended"" and ""not recommended"" in my opinion, for this reason.

The gameplay is boring, the story feels poorly written and rushed, and the graphics are woefully inconsistent.The original BioShock was a very in-depth game where strategy was key. This game is a Call of Duty clone with a steampunk setting and the BioShock name slapped on.I do not recommend this game to anyone, for any price. Avoid at all costs!			"

												What the hell is wrong with you, guys? No, not you gamers, the developers. They removed everything bioshock... well, technically system shock, but I wont split THOSE hairs right now, from this game. Choice is meaningless. Kill everyone you want, it doesn't matter. Make all your in game choices by flipping a coin, it doesn't matter. Dozens of plots are dropped into your lap and then shatter away to be forgotten without a thought. I hope you kids enjoy Songbird... for all 15 seconds you will see him. He's hyped to hell, but has absolutely no impact on the story or the game in general. But I can forgive a lot, I can... I will not, however, forgive this game's ending. I saw it and stared quietly for some time going ""huh?"" until I managed to piece it together myself and come to a conclusion. The writers were extremely high. Not the good ""purple haze"" kind of high, but the stoner in the basement giggling about God spelled backwards kind of high. In the span of 3 minutes you render the entire game moot, undo your own story, then actually go back and retroactively write the first two games out of existance. I'm not kidding about that, BTW, the forshadowing is strong with this and there are little clues that state the first two games are just this game in a different universe... and you proceed to unmake them all. You not only ruined your current game, you went back in time and ruined your first two games as well. What the HELL is wrong with you? Then you have the nerve to release this DLC featuring Rapture... even though you changed things in such a way that the city couldn't even exist. Your writing is so horrible you lost track of your own ending while you were writing it then forgot it again when you made your DLC. Oh, and before I forget, your game play was utter crap. Two weapon rule wasn't fun in the 90s, it damn sure isn't fun now. Your combat is boring enough to be seen as a chore. In short, you could not have failed harder as a game publisher if you'd simply sent us a fresh turd in a box.			"

Posted: November 26, 2013
												Okay, let me preface this by acknowledging that this game is reasonably well polished, visually impressive and doesn't really contain any content that is particularly offensive.But otherwise this game is incredibly bad, and I am going to lay out why. I think the first thing to do is to comment on the gameplay in comparison with it's forebears, Bioshock and Bioshock 2. This game does not play much like them, yet it plays too much like them. The gameplay was stripped down, with numerous features removed and replaced, and yet no significant work was done to improve the combat. This is a problem because Bioshock combat isn't good, it needs elements to it to give it flavour and strategy, such as hacking, interacting with elements in the environment and making enemies target one another, etc. Infinite only has possession as a function for replacing hacking and mind control but it does this with no flair at all. Hacked turrents/enemies are invincible when they are your ally meaning when the ability runs out you have to deal with them then. The Vigors have almost no narrative reason to be in the game and they lack variety even moreso than the Plasmids from prior games.The weapons are a massive disappointment. Only allowing for two weapons carried massively cuts down on variety of gameplay yet again, their upgrades are not interesting and just change some stats. And you're penalised for not focusing on upgrading only a couple of weapons that you will use all the time. The gunplay is terrible, enemies are bullet sponges making the combat slow and monotonous. I also think that though some areas of the game are very pretty, much of the game takes place in pretty nondescript corridors, or generic open areas.Enemies simply spawn in waves or wander around randomly. They never use tactics, there's only a handful of enemy types. The most interesting part of the game is a fairly standard stealth section and the one ""boss"" fight it has was a massive slog. At no point is this game every truly fun to play for all the obscene amount of money that clearly went into it. Having said that, the story and characters are somehow even worse. Elizabeth, for whom much of the game centres on, is a lifeless and annoying character whom it's almost impossible to feel any kind of bond with because once you are meant to protect her... you don't. She doesn't exist as far as the game's enemies are concerned, and thus you do not at any point ever protect her. You simply mass murder your way through Columbia whilst she can randomly spawn ammo, health or money for you. Despite her years of confinement, she acts like a ditzy disney princess for most of the game and when things do get more serious, she has a complete personality turn and becomes a relentless and single minded fool who spouts meaningless philosophical nonsense. The ending is incredibly stupid, makes no logical sense and is intensely cruel and evil. In the end this game doesn't manage to be about anything. It has no real message to it, no moral, and no interesting insight into any of it's characters or setting, the setting of Columbia is explored for about an hour at the start and then simply becomes a linear tube for Booker to violently fight through. All of it's characters are stock, reprehensible and pretty much at no point is it possible to sympathise with any of them as they perpetuate a cycle of greed, intolerance and murder. At least in Bioshock Rapture had an ideal built on foundations of intellectualism and free knowledge, Columbia is little more than an idealised floating American city circa 1901. If you're familiar enough with the time period, the game makes very few attempts to use that knowledge for gain, like I've seen in other historical period games like Assassins Creed. And above all, it does not serve any of it's narrative aims by being a poor shooter that doesn't even meet the most basic criteria to be a fun game. "

												I used to say that story did not matter in a game if there was a lot to do and a lot of variety. This game proves me wrong. It is an amazing story based game. There are some bugs and glitches but that did not bother me, I was so wrapped up in the story and trying to figure out what was going on as I was playing (not confused just wanted to know the whole plot). There were Easter Eggs and hints at the ending through the game which were hard to pick up on. It is just a FPS nothing special but the story makes the game more than worth it! There are some different guns, some stradegy required at times and some pretty awesome special abilities. Plus the soundtrack in my opinion is pretty awesome too. Highly recommend!Any game that leaves me dropping my controller, just saying ""no... no that... no?!"" because I was so in to the story makes it worth while. And just as a warning, it will hit your feels a little. haha Awesome game!			"

												Can't get into the game no matter how many times I try.  I'm 7 hours in at this point, and I really don't care if I ever play it again.  The first two I enjoyed, and played through all the way to the end, not wanting to stop at times.  I thought the dlc might help, but most reviews I've seen on the dlc say it's mostly garbage.  Not really sure what they were thinking with this game.  I mostly find the girl annoying, the story attrocious, and main character forgettable.  And I realize they're trying to tell a story here, but they literally put the game on rails.  I might go back to the game at some point, but there are too many games that are actually enjoyable to play that I want to get to.			"

												While the game has a decent storyline and nice environments, it provides very little freedom as to how you can interact with the world. It feels very on-rails and doesn't allow enough freedom to truly get immersed in its otherwise amazing setting. The game is a bit of a disappointment and not worth picking up at the full price, though probably a good deal if bought on a sale.			"

												""Press F to comfort Elizabeth""I am really on the fence about this game. I liked it overall, but I find it hard to see past it's major flaws. On one hand it's an insanely polished, slick and smooth AAA shooter with amazing visuals. On the other, it's hand-holding, repetitive and casual one with all the tropes and cliches of any shooter made within the last 10 years.The gameplay and shooting are great. It feels awesome shooting enemies, but later on they become bullet sponges to the extreme. The reused environments don't help this at all and I could predict easily when a fight is about to break out. Fighting in the same arena three times so I can progress past some artificial boundry is just dumb. Combat is not challenging at all, there is nearly no penalty for death other than losing a bit of cash. If you die, you're right back into it almost instantaneously (with extra ammo to boot.) With no penalty for death all tension is lost and gunfights become boring. This game needs a harder diffculty with better AI that doesn't just increase enemy health. Playing on hard is barely a challenge. The only time this game shows any semblance of difficulty is when you are tossed into an arena crawling with bullet sponges and no ammo for your weapons. (Which happens more than it should and I doubt that  was fully intended.) A dedicated weapon stand would have helped this issue. Most of my deaths came from handymen who are the biggest bullet sponges of them all and sometimes the game doesn't provide you with the necessary cover/space to evade their cheetah speed attacks. Deaths from these guys always felt cheap to me.(UPDATE:) There is a HUGE diffculty spike in the last hour or so of the game. What the hell? I've never seen anything quite like this. Nine hours of straight easy, then you have to defend an airship from hundreds of attackers. It was quite jarring being to be honest, but a welcome challenge.) It's almost as if the devs are trying to extend the life of the game as far as they can by making the last stage so much more difficult. It sticks out like a sore thumb.The power ups and weapons are fun, but most of them are redundant. You can beat the whole game easily by using the carbine and shock jockey almost exclusively. The sniper rifle is too good when it's fully upgraded. Just shock everyone and shoot them in the head. The weapon upgrades are fine, but I hated how some of them are artificially locked until you progress further, it just feels like another linear element put in to give the player the illusion of choice.This game also suffers from the same thing any game does that tells a linear story. There are far too many scripted parts that take control away from the character. I was stuck in one part for nearly 10 minutes because I wasn't looking at a book the right way to trigger a short cutscene. This game pretty much plays itself when you aren't in one of the many shooting gallerys. Some puzzles or other mechanics would really help to break up the monotony of the endless shooting.The story itself is okay, but nothing really groundbreaking. It's very predictable at times and could really use a better villain with more ""screen time."" It also seems to drag on way too long, I actually was hoping it would end a couple of times (which is never a good thing.) I'll keep this spoiler free, so I won't go any further. I can see the appeal of this game and there are parts I really liked in it. It seems I've played far too many linear action fps games ike it in the last decade to fully enjoy it. Maybe I am just spoiled. I'd give it a half thumbs up if I could.6.5/10(BY THE WAY, PLEASE FIX THE CRASHING ISSUES IN BIOSHOCK 1 AND 2 REMASTERED PLEASE.)			"

												REWRITTEN AS OF MAY 10th, 2014!First off, I have very little that is good to say about this game.Graphics: The graphics are amazing and beautiful, same as the previous Bioshock games at the time of their release, however a beautiful world does not make up for the fact that the rest of this game is bad and it certainly doesn't make up for the fact that the level design is very poor, but I'll get to that later.Gameplay/Combat: This game makes a very poor use of the already old and tired Halo combat mechanics. You get a shield that absorbs damage until it's broken, then you must get behind cover and not get damaged to get your shield recharged. You're also arbitrarily limited to a grand total of two weapons, not counting your melee, which is just a button you hit and not actually selectable. Aside from that, the combat itself is very poor consisting entirely of ""shoot these guys."" Sometimes you can get Elizebeth to summon an unlimited item cache or an automated turret from an alternate reality, but the turret dies pretty quickly and is pretty much useless, as are the item caches since Elizebeth is a fountain of free items, but I'll get to that later.Story: The story is the most nonsensical convoluted garbage I've ever had the displeasure to endure. I'll try not to spoil anything, but this game makes use of alternate realities as a plot device, which can be really good if done well. Sadly this is not the case. The alternate realities are just a convenient excuse to explain away anything that doesn't make sense, essentially the equivalent of ""a wizard did it."" The antagonist of the game, Comstock, is an evil, radical, super racist, psychotic religious leader and self-proclaimed prophet who built a flying city whose whole reason for being all that is literally the fact that he got some water poured on him, otherwise he would be a poor, drunk war veteran living in a cheap apartment regretting his actions in the civil war. I am not joking, that is literally the whole reason he's evil. The final moments of the game consist of twenty minutes of exposition because the entire plot is such a tangled mess that this was the only way the writers could attempt to make sense of it. And they failed. Miserably.Elizebeth has these powers to open ""tears"" or portals to alternate realities and as you jump from reality to reality over and over you lose track of which was the original, but the charcaters don't seem to care at all, despite their entire world changing each time.Level Design: Each and every level in this game consists of two things. You either get a mob arena, or a small enclosed area for some story to happen or poorly written exposition. I've really got nothing else to say here.Characters: I feel all the characters and their motivations are poorly written in this game, especially the antagonist, Comstock, who I've already talked about. Without spoiling anything, Booker is looking to pay off a debt he owes...By bringing them this girl, Elizebeth. I'm sorry, but what kind of good guy takes a woman he doesn't know to some seriously shady people to pay off a debt? Literally all other characters are cardboard cut outs. You've got greedy corprate shill who shows up for five seconds, strong independent black woman who don't need no man and mysterious duo who are mysterious for ♥♥♥♥♥ 'n giggles.Enemies: 90% of the enemies you face in this game are generic soldiers who use guns. Sometimes you will face a pyromaniac, a dude who sends flocks of ravens at you and a giant part mechanical man who is a bit of a tank, he's essentially the replacement for the Big Daddy, but you don't have a choice of fighting him, he just shows up and attacks you. Last, but not least, you have this annoying ghost-like banshee that makes literally no sense, she ressurects anything in the area and constantly sends them after you. Of course the explination for her existing is alternate realities, because of course it is.Graphics: 9/10Gameplay: 2/10Story: 1/10Level Design: 1/10Characters: 2/10Enemies: 1/10Overall (Average based upon above): 2.6/10Don't buy this garbage game, even if it's on sale. Just save yourself the time and the money.			"

												Today's Review: BioShock InfiniteOverview: Long i've waited to make a review of this game, and for as much i've played that exact same time is as much as i've enjoyed it, this game is a gorgeous masterpiece of gaming art and a company that sadly do not exist anymore but it can surely teach some other big companies, how to make an exceptional game.Graphics: One word: Amazing. This masterpiece puts on your screen a high quality for a low GPU, giving you a variety of properties to modify but still running on minimum you can see how marvelous this game is.Optimization: *NEW* This might be the best game's optimization in the history of games, and one of my best 10 games of all times, simply flawless in any escale.Sound: Bullet sounds, Music is set in the early 30 and 40's tho the game (between the original game and the dlc Burial at sea) is set with a game of about 40 years difference, voice acting is top quality and you get to feel what the characters experience during the game right until the end.Metascore: 97/100 ""Masterpiece of all times and GOTY 2013, a MUST BUY for any gamer out there""			"

It might be slightly confusing as to what's going on a few hours in, but it'll kick in. You have to pay attention foremost. Irrational Games went a different route in scenery this time.

So no, don't worry about being a Leon from RE4.Top voice acting, a story that is better than anything Hollywood can ever come up with and fluid gameplay. If you want to play one of the best single players, get Infinite.			"

												Clearly one of the most beautiful game designs I've ever seen, Infinite gives a awesome story just like every BioShock fan could expect. Or better. The combat system is pretty similar to the previous titles, kinda easy actually, with the addition of Elizabeth, a lovely and charismatic character who helps Booker in Combat. I finished the game in about 10h, so I guess thats the only weak point of the game. I wished it could last for many more hours.To me, GOTY 2013 is here.9.5/10			"

Here are a few:Do you enjoy complex, involved stories with interesting characters and fantastic settings?  Do you like games that make you think about their stories and meanings for weeks after you've finished them?  What about games that are unlike almost anything else you've played?If that's your style, then Bioshock Infinite is just the game for you.			"

Para análise em português, leia mais abaixo.Bioshock Infinite - Review: The Garden of Eden and the Apple of SinFrom an acclaimed franchise, Infinite had a difficult task for the series: Bring new breath to the Bioshock universe, without lose the characteristics that have made fans in the decaying underwater city of Rapture.Infinite leaves the deep water to travel to the skies. Columbia, 1912. An utopia floating in the heavens. A city of peace and harmony as mankind has never seen before. The new Eden, free from sins.And then, it all fell apart. Behind the masks of the holy city, political, religious, philosophical and scientific conflicts corrode that self imposed image. Nothing is what it seems. You're Booker DeWitt, sent to Columbia to rescue the young Elisabeth, held captive since an early age. What secrets the city hides? How important is the girl? And who is she?With a wonderful ambientation, a steampunk reality of the 20s, mixing the culture of this time with a strangely advanced technology. The soundtrack perfectly composes the plot as you cross several different and well made scenarios​​. You can really feel yourself in that place.Open your mind, prepare your heart and come see all the beauties and obscurities of Columbia.  My Personal Score   Fun: 9/10   Gameplay: 9/10   Ambientation: 10/10   History: 10/10   Replayability: 3/10   Multiplayer: 0/10 --Bioshock Infinite - Análise: O Jardim do Éden e a Maçã do PecadoPartindo de uma franquia aclamada, Infinite possuía uma difícil missão para a série: Trazer novo fôlego ao universo de Bioshock, sem perder as características que conquistaram os fãs na decadente cidade submarina de Rapture.Infinite abandona as águas profundas para viajar a céu aberto. Columbia, 1912. Uma utopia flutuando nos céus. Uma cidade de paz e harmonia como a humanidade jamais vira antes. O novo Éden, livre de pecados.E então, tudo desabou. Por trás das máscaras da santa cidade, conflitos políticos, religiosos, filosóficos e científicos corróem esta imagem que se impõe. Nada é o que parece. Você é Booker DeWitt, enviado a Columbia para resgatar a jovem Elisabeth, mantida em cativeiro desde tenra idade. Quais segredos escondem a cidade? Qual a importância da menina? E quem é ela?Com uma ambientação maravilhosa, uma realidade steampunk dos anos 20 mistura a cultura da época com uma tecnologia estranhamente avançada. A trilha sonora compõe perfeitamente a trama, enquanto vocês cruza diversos cenários diferentes e bem feitos. É possível realmente se sentir no local.Abra sua mente, prepare seu coração e venha conhecer todas as belezas e obscuridades de Columbia.  Minhas Notas Pessoais   Diversão: 9/10   Gameplay: 9/10   Ambientação: 10/10   História: 10/10   Rejogabilidade: 3/10   Multiplayer: 0/10  "

												STORY : 10/10A great novel for video game. It's good enough for make a movie.it's very complex but it'll make u surprise in climax.  GAMEPLAY : 7/10Shoot, smash, use vigor(magic skill) for kill enemy.Find out for money for upgrade ur gun and vigor, infusion potion for upgrade ur stats(shield,health,vigor).It's linear gameplay in bigmap.Will be much more better if weapon slot is 4 or more.GRAPHIC and SOUND : 9/10Very fantastic but not the best.Like a combination with realistic and cartoon. Great Bloody Fantasy.OST. is very good. The game has a lot of nice music.If u wanna play a real bioshock infinite, I suggest u to play 1999 mode for more challenge and achievement.(after complete the game once in normal or easy mode)When I complete the game once in hard mode, I thought the gameplay is so common. But 1999mode make me like the gameplay. This mode's very hard. especially, Lady Comstock fight.I suggest u to upgrade just Possession, Shock, Sender vigor and only weapon damage for all(except pistol, hail fire and burst gun) but upgrade all for repeater and RPG for the last fight.and don't buy anything from Dollar Bill for ""Scavenger Hunt"" achievement.Equip Winter Shield and Sky-Line Reloader when u can use skyline, u'll become immortal.

												This isn't a video game, this is a piece of artwork (on par with other moving paintings like Shadow of the Colossus) that you have the privilege of experiencing.  The story and characters will transport you to another place entirely, a city in the clouds where the idea of white, American, Christian, capitalist culture has been turned into what can only be described as a haunting cult. Don't go into this game expecting to find the greatest shooting mechanics ever created; that isn't what it's about (which isn't to say the shooting and fighting isn't fantastic).  It's about the immersion from the brilliantly crafted storyline and beautiful writing.  This is one of those rare games where you truly sympathize and connect with the characters, especially Elizabeth - they feel alive, largely in due to the amazing voice acting.  Honestly,  if this had been written as a novel as opposed to a video game, it would be a modern classic.I never thought any video game could come close to making me re-live the emotion I first felt when playing Ocarina of Time (my favorite title ever) but this comes extremely close.  If Ocarina is a 10, this is a 9.99999999999999999~.Play the game.  Wipe away the debt. "

												After playing this game I'm wondering if there is a universe in which I didn't like it. The answer is probably NOT, because this is one of the most ridiculously beautiful game I've ever played.Does it have amazing graphics? Yes, it does.Does it have amazing voice acting? Yes, it does.Does it have the most realistic, fun and talented female companion of all time? Yes, it does.Does it have great variety of combat scenarios? Yes, it does.Does it have a complex, incredibly beautiful, engaging, feelingful storyline? The tears of sadness and joy in my face says so.Does it have a satisfying ending? F*CK YEAH IT DOES!Sadly, I don't have enough knowledge of the English language to come up with any more adjectives to rate this game. This isn't even a game, it's a work of art. Those who say that games can't have the same impact as movies or books ARE F. STUPID. And those who say this game in particular does not have at least one of the best storylines ever didn't understand it. I guarantee it! Read a guide online and be amazed.I rate it 10/10 for the story. I'll add another 3 for combat mechanics, 2 for graphics and scenery, and 2 more for the game longevity. So, 17/10.Oh wait, did I mention Elizabeth? The companion? She's great, oh so great, that I think I'll add OVER 9000 points because of her. Yes, that sounds fine.So yeah... my final rating for this game is an astounding OVER 9000/10. SHUT UP, the king can do as he likes!I also loved the Rapture reference from Bioshock 1. One more point for that.  Play this game. PLAY IT.Did I mention how great this story is?			"

												Kind of like Baccano anime, at first you will understand some and some what confused not to worry because by the end, everything will be tied up and you will be compeletly confused.No matter how you interpret the story of the game, it will leave you pleased, bought it for much cheaper but seems like steam sales are getting worse every year, better pick it up before they never even put it on sale			"

												BioShock Infinite is an artistic masterpiece. Beautiful, suspenseful, and haunting at times; it captures a blending of history and myth to create something both wonderfully unique and familiar. Elizabeth is one of the best characters to ever appear in a game and the world is beautiful.Story: 10/10 As we all come to expect from Irrational, the plot of this game is bursting with rich parallels, powerful emotional imagery and an ending (brilliantly foreshadowed throughout) that will leave you both satisfied and begging for more. Ambiance: 10/10 This is where the game really shines. Each set-piece alone could be a work of art, each architectural blend, each cultural costume. All of the visual splendor mixed together with a score that perfectly juxtaposes the glamor and grit of what Columbia represents. Gamplay: 10/10 I expected a rich story and beautiful visuals/music, what I did not expect was game-play (particularly combat) that surpassed Irrationals previous games in terms of enjoyment and dynamic action. This game takes everything that we loved from previous BioShock games and adds a whole new level of tactical planning and on the fly improvisation. Each combat area is a stage set for a brilliant play, each enemy adding new challenge, each weapon a chance to master. Never has combat been so challenging and satisfying in a BioShock game.			"

												Despite dragging itself a little in some parts, the amazing level design, the magnificence of Columbia, the supremely satisfying shooter and the superbly crafted story (with a mind-blowing ending) are more than enough to turn Bioshock Infinite into 2013 GOTY, hands-down. It's almost unfair to all the other games that are still to come.			"

												This isn't a video game, this is a piece of artwork (on par with other moving paintings like Shadow of the Colossus) that you have the privilege of experiencing.  The story and characters will transport you to another place entirely, a city in the clouds where the idea of white, American, Christian, capitalist culture has been turned into what can only be described as a haunting cult. Don't go into this game expecting to find the greatest shooting mechanics ever created; that isn't what it's about (which isn't to say the shooting and fighting isn't fantastic).  It's about the immersion from the brilliantly crafted storyline and beautiful writing.  This is one of those rare games where you truly sympathize and connect with the characters, especially Elizabeth - they feel alive, largely in due to the amazing voice acting.  Honestly,  if this had been written as a novel as opposed to a video game, it would be a modern classic.I never thought any video game could come close to making me re-live the emotion I first felt when playing Ocarina of Time (my favorite title ever) but this comes extremely close.  If Ocarina is a 10, this is a 9.99999999999999999~.Play the game.  Wipe away the debt. "

												I love this game and strongly dislike shooters. Yes, it’s a shooter, and there is a lot of shooting, but this game is more about the story and less about the shooting. The story is absolutely engrossing. The game world pulls you in and makes you want to know more and more about the city of Columbia. I highly recommend taking your time and listening and viewing all that collectibles. The collectible really do a good job of fleshing out the city’s history and the history of its main citizens. The city is fully realized and I could spend hours walking through it and taking it all in. The character of the city is beautiful at first. Then as you start listening more and more to the chatter of the citizens and you start reading the billboards and advertisements you soon realize this city is not the Eden you thought.While the city of Columbia as a character is completely fascinating, Elizabeth, your female partner which the entire story hinges on, is even more interesting. She exudes innocence, naivety, curiosity, empathy, adventure, courageousness, bravery, and sadness. I’ve never played a game that caused me to feel guilty and sadness towards a character. Elizabeth takes you on an emotional roller coaster that I never wanted to end.When the ride was over, and the last piano key was struck, I just sat in my chair, staring at my monitor. The emotional tug of the game had left me immobile and speechless. I wanted more time with these characters. I didn't want the game to end. I wanted to know more about the city, about Comstock, about Booker, and about Elizabeth. I didn't want this to be the end.As I sat there, mindlessly watching the credits roll by, and listening as the various music played I replayed the entire game in my head. Then, during the credits you get to watch the voice actors sing the song, Will the Circle Be Unbroken?. I listened to the words; I then understood what the song meant and how it relates to the game and the ending.After all is said-and-done, no game I have ever played has caused in me such an emotional reaction. No game has made me want to save a character more and no game has made me sit and stare off into space when it was over. The ending hit me like the LOST series finale. It's over......and I'm sad that it is.			"

												After playing this game I'm wondering if there is a universe in which I didn't like it. The answer is probably NOT, because this is one of the most ridiculously beautiful game I've ever played.Does it have amazing graphics? Yes, it does.Does it have amazing voice acting? Yes, it does.Does it have the most realistic, fun and talented female companion of all time? Yes, it does.Does it have great variety of combat scenarios? Yes, it does.Does it have a complex, incredibly beautiful, engaging, feelingful storyline? The tears of sadness and joy in my face says so.Does it have a satisfying ending? F*CK YEAH IT DOES!Sadly, I don't have enough knowledge of the English language to come up with any more adjectives to rate this game. This isn't even a game, it's a work of art. Those who say that games can't have the same impact as movies or books ARE F. STUPID. And those who say this game in particular does not have at least one of the best storylines ever didn't understand it. I guarantee it! Read a guide online and be amazed.I rate it 10/10 for the story. I'll add another 3 for combat mechanics, 2 for graphics and scenery, and 2 more for the game longevity. So, 17/10.Oh wait, did I mention Elizabeth? The companion? She's great, oh so great, that I think I'll add OVER 9000 points because of her. Yes, that sounds fine.So yeah... my final rating for this game is an astounding OVER 9000/10. SHUT UP, the king can do as he likes!I also loved the Rapture reference from Bioshock 1. One more point for that.  Play this game. PLAY IT.Did I mention how great this story is?			"

Gladius Dei or ""same, same but different!""Bioshock Infinite is basically a revamped version of BS2 in a new environment. The gameplay is superior over the other episodes and much better balanced. The story is nearly as good as the first one. It cares for the female player, got lotsa eye-candy and has the highest grade of replayability compared to the other parts. In my opinion, balancing story and gameplay, the best of all 3 Bioshock games. If you liked the others, you will also like this one. At best, you played just BS1 and not the 2nd part beforehand (unless you wanna play all 3).storyThough BS2 had not a bad story, the Would you kindly? moment was missing. Now, you got a repackaged BS2 story which takes care of that. It is somewhat unrelated to the other episodes and you could use it as a starter to the Bioshock world, though due to graphics and gameplay, I advise against it.It definitely tries to get the girls to the consoles as in a slightly female colour scheme, a female hero w/o mega♥♥♥♥♥♥nor skin tight leather... and to top that up, even a change of hair dressing is included! ;P That said, there is enough blood, dirt and gore and Bioshock manages once more to combine high morals with bloodiest violence and beautiful sceneries.A lot has been recycled from BS2, though: It feels a bit like the Syren Alley level and its objective being a whole game combined with the Eleanor meta story. In Ryan's Amusements you had to get a Plasmid inside a propaganda amusement park for kids in order to continue a journey on a train. In Soldier's Field the difference is only that Plasmids are called Vigors and that you continue your journey in a Gondola. Besides an obstacle blocks your carriage and you have to get the Plasmid/Vigor inside a children's propaganda theme park. Fink and his stage reminded me a bit of The Great Alexander - There are many moments which feel like BS2.gameplayUsed to be the biggest pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥on its predecessors, but the Bioshock team seems to learn by trial and error. Each part gets better gameplay-wise and now, the mindless spawning and many shortcomings of BS1 and BS2 are gone.The gameplay is much better balanced due to:* ""Killer""-Plasmids are mostly gone in the main game (like Winter Blast for example).* Plasmids are generally better balanced and thus less powerful than before.* Adam is gone as character building source it is now ""all about money"". Since corpses contain money, the infinite spawning of enemies is gone in BS Infinite.* the marvellous Green Arrow which gives you directions on demand!  No more ""Should I turn the quest arrow on or off?"" A+++* The research system is gone and nobody will miss it!* Sadly, the mini-games are gone, too. Elizabeth lockpicks the doors, safes and chests for you now.* Enemies and gear are revamped but the same: Houdinis, now called Zealots, are fewer but tougher. Handymen are basically extra fiery Brute Splicers and the Rumbler returns in a downgraded version as Beasts; there is even a  Mark Meltzer moment. Insect Swarm is also far less powerful now and replaced by Murder of Crows - which is a good thing, since Insect Swarm and Winter Blast was all you needed, even on the most difficult settings.* generally, the gameplay is more stream-lined, though there are more collectibles.* Negative: More CoD-like in the sense of a less tactical approach and the shortage of resources.* Many tutorial elements in the game are too short or simply missing. Vigor Combos for example, though there would have been enough chance for it on some fair stand. * The skyline could be better integrated into the gameplay, but as mentioned below, it seems to be technically the most critical part.graphics, bugs & CoRan it on Win7 64bit with a Geforce GTX760 on highest settings w/o problems. Only major bugs I encountered was on the skyline, there I got stuck under certain circumstances. Also, the only minor bug I am aware of is as well connected to the skyline. It let's Liz circle the skyline for hours, once I am already off - but it doesn't hinder progress and at some stage she is back.Unfair to compare graphics, since I played both old parts on XP, but lotsa eye-candy indeed. And as I found just far more ""picturesque"". Burial at SeaHaven't played it as of yet....Btw: Si tacuisses... !Hm, a game that costs soo much money to produce and is so in love with detail, ridicules itself by misuse of professionell knowledge?The first steps into Columbia makes you believe you entered an alternate world of idiots: * Gladium is like clavem an Accusative version of the words gladius,-i and clavis,-e.* 2 Lockpicks will never open a lock, but inserting a tension wrench[/i] and a lockpick will. Besides but important: Locks don't get damaged by picking (but picking can be detected forensicly). "

												Not everyone was entirely happy or impressed with where the developers chose to take this third entry in the almost-legendary Bioshock series, but in my opinion the decisions made were mostly the ""right"" ones.  MOSTLY.      Let me just say straight up - and this may well be an opinion subject to change given that I've played the first two games twice and this one but once - that this is probably my ""least favourite"" of the three games.  This is a purely personal thing:  I am, on the whole, more a fan of ""horror"" than other fantasy-related genres, and while the first two games were perhaps not strictly of said genre, they certainly leaned more heavily toward that side of things than this latest instalment does.     Which brings us to the first two significant decisions made during the development of this game:  first up, the change of setting from ruined, claustrophobic underwater city to a city in the clouds rapidly HEADED towards downfall; and secondly, the shifting of the main ""enemy"" type from insane, physically-deformed mutants (some with the rough equivalent of supernatural powers) to well-armed soldiers and revolutionaries caught in a power-struggle to either defend or bring down the mad ""prophet"" who founded their would-be utopia.     It's obviously a matter of purely personal taste which of these two ""tones"" one prefers...but in spite of myself generally favouring the former, I do have to say that they really COULD NOT have gotten away with a third game set in the city of Rapture.  So all things considered, I'm conceding that they probably made the ""right"" decision.  It was due time to change things up a little, and they've done so in a way which is equal parts ""obvious"" (moving from a city under the sea to a city in the clouds) and ""inspired"" (they really could have just done another POST-apocalyptic scenario, but instead chose to tell an entirely different story...and good for them)!    This said, the actual GAMEPLAY is remarkably similar to the earlier games, with one important exception:  they've replaced a bunch of lovable (if slightly creepy) little girls with a single grown woman, and this is arguably where things become most different.  Say goodbye to the oddly endearing task of liberating and/or baby-sitting ""Little Sisters"", and say hello to a sassy, would-be ""romantic"" interest who's constantly torn between despising our (anti-) hero for his ""brute""-like behaviour, and being strangely attracted to him for, well, basically the same reasons (hmmph...women)!     Not only does this change the tone of the piece quite significantly - call me a sap and/or misogynist, but I was actually quite moved by all the ""take care of the cute little gals"" antics of parts 1 and 2 - but in effect also makes this a much more linear experience than the first two games. Our only reason to ""backtrack"" now is to get more goodies hidden behind doors which our female companion can helpfully pick the locks of, rather than the far more involved task of harvesting ""ADAM"" required in the first two games.     In short, we've lost a bit of tiny bit of strategizing along the way, in favour of a more straight-forwardly arcade-y experience of moving from location to location and killing lots of things and picking up a bunch of stuff.  Again...personal preference will decide for the individual whether this is a good or bad thing.  I myself found it all a bit repetitive and ""draggy"" towards the end, and found myself mainly using only two of the eight ""vigors""/special powers on offer, but y'know...that's just me.      Whichever way you look at it, this is still a pretty smart, classy game.  It boasts some of the best graphics in video game history (think an ultraviolent ""Disney"" cartoon, and you're getting warm), and a pretty interesting storyline to boot (though I gotta say, the people who made such a huge fuss over the supposedly ""controversial"" ending...you people really need to read more, or at the very least stop watching all those ♥♥♥♥ing Michael Bay and Marvel movies, 'cause it really wasn't THAT much of a mind-blowing revelation at the end).     There's every chance I'll even find myself utterly adoring it the second time around, but right now...frankly, I'm a little ""spectacular""-ed out.  Which is a way of saying this game isn't exactly anyone's definition of ""subtle"", so if that's what you're looking for...I dunno, maybe try Gone Home or something instead.  But if it's slam-bang action and jaw-dropping scenery you want, with just a pinch of cleverness and mind-♥♥♥♥ing thrown into the narration to add a bit of spice, there's not much risk of finding disappointment here.  Verdict: 9/10.			"

												I played this game and loved it, but I am not going to pretend it was perfect. While it's considered a game, the game parts are above-avarage at best. I'll go over it.Story: You are Looker DeWitt, a man hired to find a certain girl in the lands of columbia for a price. That's how it starts at least. Throughout the story you meet Elizabeth, and unlike most followers in games, she isn't useless and is actually rather charming. The story shows their tale... tales... I don't even know how to describe it because the ending is a mind breaker, but i won't spoil it. Either way you'll see them learn and progress. Especially Elizabeth changes over time. Starting as an innocent lady and eventually becoming a badass. The story is easily the strongest part of the game, even if it's all over the place at times due to the cheap way of ""Alternate Timelines/Dimensions"" yada yada. But in this game it was actually implemented in a very good way. For story alone I would recommend the game. But I'm not done yet.Graphics:The graphics are stellar. Columbia is really beautiful and other areas in the game are aswell, but in a different way. You can see how bad something is going just by looking around in later areas and it's a really beautiful but also a kind of sad place at times. The game is beautiful, no doubt about it.Racism?:Yeah yeah you heard it from everyone, hur durr racist game. Seriously, don't even pretend racism doesn't exist. In fact, I would say it's a strong point of the game. Gives you more of a reason to hate the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in charge. So those who complain about this game being racist, IT'S FOR A REASON.Audio design:The music in areas really add to the atmosphere of the game. Both for the darker and lighter places in Bioshock infinite, the music makes the areas really stand out. Sound effects are pretty good aswell. I would say the gun sound effects COULD be better, but it's not bad. It's pretty good. Other than that the sound in the game is great! The voice acting is done extremely well and the actors really helped you get attached to eachother and the emotions the characters felt were well translated by the voice actors.Gameplay:Look. Like I said. The Gameplay is above avarage at best. You have two spots for guns. While this could be used for strategy, there is no reason to. It's clear which guns are better for you and it's not like you're running out of ammo anytime soon. Or health for that matter, as Elizabeth keeps throwing health pickups, ammo pickups and salt (explaining that later) pickups. The only time you ever really get in trouble is when Elizabeth isn't there. And that's a really small portion of the game. Elizabeth kinda feels overpowered, but either way everything around you contains health, ammo and salt too. Seriously, if you have elizabeth with you, shoot away! You won't run out of ammo, at least I didnt.You also have these vigors (or plasmids). They are really fun to use I'll admit. But besides watching crows kill people or lighting people on fire, there is no reason to use it. The upgrades for the vigors and weapons arent anything to be excited about either. Then there is the skylines... A neat feature. But really not that useful for anything other than escaping some mad men. Good luck aiming when you're turning around a corner on the skyline. Now, is Bioshock Infintie worth the price tag?... I'll be honest, it is if you care about story and graphics. If you want it purely for gameplay, then please wait for when it's a decent price, like on sales. But the price tag now is pretty appropriate for this game. It's not the best game ever, but it's damn good at what it wants to do. Create an atmospheric experience with excellent story and graphics. Sadly, they sacrificed Gameplay for it, but it's definitely something anyone must experience. Just wait untill the price is appropriate for you, and then get it.			"

												The Story is amazing. It's the Inception of Video games.But unfortunately the FPS-mechanics aren't brilliant to be honest.And that's a shame, when a big part of the game is fighting.Nevertheless, I've still enjoyed myself a lot when playing this, so I couldn't say anything less than that it's amazing!I've played it three times now and I'm thinking of playing it a fourth.Definitely recommended!

												Even though I might be a little late to the party, I still wanted to play this game; which I was finally able to now, during the Steam Summer Sales.I have played the first part of the game and up until now, it has been looking beautiful; the level design better than that of the previous two games; and the main game concepts very similar.The worst thing so far in this game, however, are the controls. Why put melee on 'v'? That's a terrible default place for a melee weapon, especially considering that opening crates/looting bodies has been put on the 'f'-key. Which of those two will you need in the stressfull situations in which you might die within a second? Punching the guy in front of you with your hook-arm-thing, or looting the dead bodies strewn around, because they might just contain some +health? Exactly. [I swapped the two buttons immediately, when I learned that melee was 'v']Other than the infuriating controls, I would still recommend this game, for both the stunning visuals and the fact that people have been rating this game highly. Now let's hope that I finish this game sometime within ten years...			"

												If you had not followed this games hype, and you had not played Bioshock 1 & 2, then this game is fantastic, buy it, get sucked into the narrative.If not?Then you're like me. I wanted to like this game, I really did. But the issues begin when the game was first announced. All the ads, all the hype for it went into overdrive, even if you avoided it, it was there in a wave that would easily wash over you. When the game was first announced, it really seemed as if it would be a succesor to the game famous for its storyline, setting, and twists. When it was announced, the game was nothing like it is now. And if you followed just how they set up the game before it was released, all the hype of Handymen and Boys of Silence, then you would be kicked in the groin as you realize the two enemies are thrown into the final version of the game as little more than an afterthought. The game boasted its many possible choices, all the good and bad things you could do with your magical partner in crime...But when it came down to it, not a single choice you made mattered five seconds after making it. Sure, Bioshock 1 & 2 were similar, the Little Sisters gave you mana, but the game actually changed depending on those decisions. The Little Sisters would tremble in fear of the infamous Boogieman who had slaughtered every child he had gotten his topsider hands on, or the Bad Daddy who had no heart unto that steel carapace. And on those lines, Bioshock Infinite took the concept of Vigors/Plasmids and ruined it. It became a gimic, where every single power ultimately did the same thing. The only difference was that an enemy who was obviously well versed with that power was immune. The vigors were almost useless throughout the game, their only use being to incapacitate enemies for short periods of time so you could focus on the much better developed guns. No longer could you work so hard at sacrificing power for quite some time so you could gain a power that earns you a temporary but nigh-invulnerable protector, that would simply be too easy wouldn't it? Enemies you hypnotize seem to lose their effectiveness by at least half, moving in sluggish hazes as compared to the devoutly loyal you could possess in this games predecesors. And on my final point, one of my biggest issues with Bioshock Infinite was its take on the Big Daddy. Songbird. A grotesque beast trapped within confines of leather and metal. The game constantly boasts its strength, unmatched and undefeated. And for a while, running into the beast was exhilerating, I could see why people simply loved the single, giant creature that replaced the numerous abominations of Rapture.  And then, one day, I came upon a realization that ruined it for me.Songbird was not a threat.Various scenes have you running from Songbird, trying to prepare for its arrival, or simply trying to thwart the beast. But at any point where the creature confronts you, at any point where you may be challenged, you lose control of the character. You watch a cutscene of Booker somehow escaping the beast, and then going on to have Elizabeth rant about how powerful Songbird was. There is a type of horror in creatures in a sense of ""show, don't tell,"" and it feels like the makers of this game tried a version of that. Thing is, the illusion of the threat and horror is simply too thin.This is an amazing game, believe me. It simply is not the perfect work of art people claim it to be.			"

It has an absolutely intriguing story, it's visuals are absolutely gorgeous, the gameplay is incredibly fun and the design, from begining to end, shines with brilliance. This is without a shadow of a doubt one of my all time favourite games at this point, and you will be doing yourself a great dishonor if you don't experience this for yourself.			"

												I've never really had a favourite game. Favourite book? Yes, Favourite film? Yes. But never a game, there were so many great ones that I couldn't separate. At least until I played Bioshock Infinite & it took my Number 1 slot by a mile! In fact, before I would put the game on such a pedestall, I played it again within 6 months. I actually enjoyed it even more than the first time.I was gifted Biosock 1 by a friend as I like immersive, story driven games. Not only was the plot engaging & inovative, & the gameplay interesting & open to different styles, the game was a set in a fabulously good looking location. However, it built itself up so well, that a boss fight wasn't enough to do the story justice & I was left wishing they'd actually finished the plot, instead of simply ending the game. Bioshock 2 was more of the same, adding lots to the universe but resolving little. A good game on it's own, but didin't really do anything new.I expected more of the same from Bioshock Infinite, but I'm happy to say, I was left utterly, stupidly & soundly corrected.Bioshock Infinite takes what made Bioshock 1 & 2 great while learning the lessons of the earlier game & in the process did something I have never seen in a game: make an NPC the lead character...The game is set in 1912, in a cloud city called Columbia, which is another beautiful setting to play out the story, with a clever rail system you can travel along & dive-bomb onto enemies or gun them down from the rail. Either way, you can become death from above & is a brilliant addition & makes Columbia feel like it is in the air. And yes, you can fall to your death. Or make an enemy fall to their death. Great fun.The guns are period weapons, & like all Bioshock games, they can be upgraded for bigger clips, reduced recoil, bigger hitting power etc, but unlike Bioshock 1, the guns dont change appearances. Previously, guns have gained mechaincal devices that are doing the job of the upgrade. It feels like a step backwards, but it's a small gripe & one of the few I can find. Ammo can become scarce for certain weapons as you go through the game, but as before, there are vending machines dishing out health & ammo, so if you have the money, you can keep your guns stocked. You also have Vigours; abilities that let you shoot electric bots or fireballs, or even flocks of deadly crows. You need Salt to 'power' these & is picked up or purchased like ammo. Known as Plasmids in Bioshock 1 & 2. They give great tactical flexibility, you can use them or not, the game leaves it up to you. The variety is nice & I found I used all the different Vigours more often than Plasmids, although I did stick to combos that worked with the type of weapons I choose.The plot is layered really nicely. If you just want to shoot stuff, then there is a fairly simple ""get this girl & bring her back"" plot to enjoy, with a fairly relentless & fanatical antagonist (Comstock) pursuing you. However, delve deeper & there are ideas & commentaries on equality, racism, revolutionaries, religion, fanaticism, science, morality & even time travel. There are so many levels to engage on & this helps to hide the fact that Bioshock Infinite is a pretty stright, linear FPS, no sandboxing here my friend, but this helps pacing so well that, trust me, you won't notice it at all. On my second play through, even knowing the plot, I felt like I got more involved in the game as I know the characters & their stories.On the characters, there are the Letuce twins, who provide some comedic & satarical relief, hiding the fact they are actually important components of the story, Comtock; a fanatical, charismatic leader who after a few taunts at your character, you really want to beat. Your character, a guy called Booker De Witt & I should tell you, he is a complete a*rehole. In fact, 1st play through, I almost wanted him to end up the bad guy & get what he deserves! You character is pretty unlikable throughout, although he does develop into a better man towards the end, but he remains a perfect anti-hero because he never really becomes the hero. The other thing to say about Booker is that the story of Bishock Infintite is NOT primarily about him. Of course, he is a major character in the story, as is Comstock, but the story is about an NPC, the girl you are sent to Columbia to recover; Elizibeth. Elizabeth is one of my truly favourite things about Bioshock Infinite in that the decision to make her the main character & keep her with the player throughout was made early & stuck to relentlessly by Irrational Games. Even when it seemed impossible to make her work the way they wanted her too, Irrational stuck at it. And this tenacity makes Bioshock Infinite stand head & shoulders above all but a handfull of games, of any type.During combat, Elizabeth ducks out of the way, keeping out of the line of fire, but chucking you ammo, health & salt occasionally, but you can't rely on this all of the time as the supply varies throughout the game. Once the combat ends, she emerges safe & sound. Occasionally, when she's ahead of you, she is in enemy sight, but they ignore her but open fire instantly when you're spotted. Again, a slight flaw, but it happens on few occasions so is one I'm happy to forgive. This means, the rest of the time, she can make conversation with Booker, grow as a character & give the player a chance to invest in the story that unfolds around you both. She has a wonderful, stubborn niavity that is steady worn down through the game & she matures into a much 'older' version of herself, which is reflected as her clothes get damaged & torn, she cuts her hair & she picks up injuries at set pieces.For some reason, my first thought when I saw her was that she reminded me of Belle from Disney's Beuty & The Beast, both in her initial character, dress & hair syle, but it may just be me. Either way, Elizabeth is a fantastic innovation both as a character to grow, develop & revolve a plot around & as a technical acheviement of making her function properly through what is occasionally a frantic FPS.I mentioned Irrational learning lessons from the previous 2 Bioshock's & the biggest is how to end a plot, which is not finished by a boss fight & a cut-scene. There is a boss fight, a fairly tough one, but after that, there is about 20mins of 'game' left as you are taken through the plot, tying up all the strings that have been laid down into a fabulous bundle that left me really, really wanting more, but utterly satisied all the same. There's no combat, very few choices the player needs to make, but I was so enthralled I barely noticed 1st time around. It was only when I reached the actual end, when the story was finally unravelled& revealled that I noticed I'd finished the FPS bit some time ago. It wasn't quite the ultimate hairs-standing-on-end, but a few stood up for me, even the second time around.Basically, if you like immersive, story driven games with good characters & a beautiful setting to play it all out in, then Bioshock Infinite is a game you absolutely MUST play, as it is one of the best. No argument. So go buy it at what ever price it's at & play it.I cannot put into words how highly I recommend Bioshock Infinite.			"

												BioShock Infinite is a really fun game with a very unique story. If you haven't played this game yet but intend to, do yourself a favor and DO NOT spoil the twist ending for youself. Like any game, it has its imperfections: I feel like the new Health/Salts system is nowhere as good as the system in the first BioShock Health/Eve system. Here, instead of having several health kits and even hypos on you that allow you to refresh your health and eve in a battle, you need to actively look for those items in your environment which can often be a hassle because the salts are so scarce. While under different circumstances this system might have worked, in BioShock Infinite it just becomes annoying after a while. Another qualm that I have is the Vigors themselves. While each of the vigors is unique and can be combo'd with another vigor, most of the vigors do essentially the same thing: they disable enemies in an area for a few seconds and deal some damage. There are some exceptions but ultimately out of the entire arsenal of vigors you end up just going around using one of them to do all the work. Unlike BioShock 1 and 2, the storyline is now much more linear and while some sandbox elements were added such as a couple of secret locations, they're barely noticeable. The Haevy Hitters, which are the equivalents of the Big Daddies from previous games have been reduced from enemies that you need to carefully plan your fights with to simple bullet sponges. Ultimately, despite these flaws the game is still very fun and enjoyable, has a great story and I do recommend, but it doesn't live up to the original BioShock. "

												BioShock Infinite is a prequel to the original BioShock and BioShock 2, as opposed to being in the underwater city of Rapture, the main character is launched up into the clouds to the floating city of Columbia... Visually, the game is absolutely beautiful, the settings are breathtaking, the buildings and items and people, so much detail went into them all... The gameplay is perfection, movements are fluid and easy to work with, between your weapons and your vigors, and the combination between them all, it just feels right (my personal preference for most of the time is Shock Jockey and the Hand Cannon)... The story line is awesome, and really makes you think about what is reality, who you are, what you're doing, the people you interact with, and so on... it was very touching and compelling... The characters are amazing and memorable... Booker, Elizabeth, Comstock, the Luteces, Slate, Fink, Fitzroy, all great... Overall, everything works together perfectly, and I couldn't ask for anything better, absolutely well-made, 10/10, highly recommended!EDIT: as of Feb 6, 2016, I have played through this game multiple times, and its DLCs, and have collected every achievement to 100%, so you can take my word for it, I have played everything thoroughly ;)			"

												Bioshock Infinite is the third in the Bioshock series and takes place in a different environment. Both Bioshock 1 & 2 took place in the underwater city of Rapture, while Infinite takes place in the flying city of Columbia. In general though, the gameplay between the three games is very similar and if you liked parts 1 & 2, you should like Infinite as well.A recap in case you haven’t played any of the Bioshock games yet:Bioshock 1 showed what might happen in a world ruled by extreme practicality, everyone looking out for their own best interest. A man named Andrew Ryan created the equivalent of Atlas Shrugged’s “Atlantis.” In the underwater city of Rapture, there was economics without government oversight, art without censorship, and science without ethics. Imagine what the Olympics would be like if all athletes were allowed to take steroids or be otherwise enhanced. Rapture collapsed (figuratively) when people started “splicing” freely.  A substance called Adam was discovered from deep sea slugs that could be used to transfer modified genetic material to people. Everyone could buy these “plasmids” giving themselves superhuman powers and other genetic modifications. Unfortunately people became addicted to this “self-improvement” and a kind of civil war broke out which ended up leaving the city a ghost town. You show up in the final days of the city and try to find your way back to the surface.In Bioshock 2, you learn more about the final days of Rapture, as well as what happened after the fall. A psychiatrist Sofia Lamb came to Rapture to try to solve the city’s problems, but she ended up creating an even bigger divide amongst the citizens. Dr. Lamb saw the potential to create a true Utopia (perfect world) but realized that to have a Utopian city requires Utopian citizens (everyone living to serve the greater good).  She tried to create the first Utopian using Adam gene splicing, with the result being a superhuman with all the memories and super powers of everyone in the city (bad idea). You play a different character from the first game trying to rescue someone held captive in the city a couple years after the events of Bioshock 1.The story of Bioshock Infinite actually takes place before parts 1 or 2. In the flying city of Columbia, the opposite of Rapture has happened. The city is ruled by religion and actually seems like a great place (if you’re not a racial minority). Bear in mind that this takes place in the early 1900’s so there’s a lot of racism and discrimination. The first half hour of the game you might be shocked at how awesome Columbia is, with no crime, and everything is on the honor system. People don’t need to watch their stores because nobody steals. Instead of worshipping God, the people of Columbia seem to worship the Founding Fathers of the United States (George Washington, Ben Franklin, etc.). The city is controlled by “the Prophet” with the people gladly giving their lives for him if needed. As you go along you find that under the surface, the city is on the verge of revolution. You play the character Booker DeWitt, a private detective looking for a girl being held prisoner somewhere in Columbia. When you find the girl Elizabeth, you realize that she has the power to create dimensional rifts and is revered (and feared) by the people of Columbia as a kind of messiah who will bring destruction to the sinful world below. The story is pretty complicated since it involves dimensional travel (maybe time travel?) and a lot of shifting loyalties. I’m still not 100% sure of what happened in the end but it’s a gripping ride nevertheless.Bioshock Infinite is a First Person Shooter similar to Half-Life 2 in that it has no out of body “cut scenes.” You see everything from the view of Booker DeWitt with the story happening around you. There isn’t too much variety in weapons, although a few of the weapons have different “versions” since they’re used by different factions in the story. The game has “vigors” which are basically the same as plasmids in the first 2 Bioshock games. Think of them as magic powers that you find along the way. You have a health bar and a “salts” bar (mana) and you find a lot of health and salt pickups, many of which are dropped by enemies when they die. The game also seems easier than Bioshock 1 & 2 because Elizabeth is with you most of the time as your ammo / health supplier. You don’t need to escort her and she tosses you items occasionally when you’re almost overwhelmed.Pros:+Excellent story that you “live” instead of read about. In Bioshock 1 & 2, you mostly learn the story by listening to recordings.+Decently long game with a lot of replay value. I’ve played through the game 3 times and I’m keeping it on my hard drive to play again.+There’s a lot of variety in environment. You’re not stuck in an underwater city this time. You can fight in the sunny outdoors, flying along skylines, or in a “haunted house.”+The price is pretty low for this game. It was so critically acclaimed that it’s constantly a sale headliner.Cons:-No multiplayer, but frankly I don’t see how multiplayer would add much. Maybe a co-op mode would be nice but is unnecessary.-A huge bunch of the Steam achievements are for the game’s DLCs. I usually don’t buy DLCs and the Season Pass for the game is as expensive as the main game :(Overall, Bioshock Infinite is definitely recommended to fans of shooter games and good stories. So many people seem to have the game that you could probably use Steam’s family sharing to play it off of your friends’ accounts. It’s a pretty big download but definitely worth it.  "

												BioShock Infinite is a prequel to the original BioShock and BioShock 2, as opposed to being in the underwater city of Rapture, the main character is launched up into the clouds to the floating city of Columbia... Visually, the game is absolutely beautiful, the settings are breathtaking, the buildings and items and people, so much detail went into them all... The gameplay is perfection, movements are fluid and easy to work with, between your weapons and your vigors, and the combination between them all, it just feels right (my personal preference for most of the time is Shock Jockey and the Hand Cannon)... The story line is awesome, and really makes you think about what is reality, who you are, what you're doing, the people you interact with, and so on... it was very touching and compelling... The characters are amazing and memorable... Booker, Elizabeth, Comstock, the Luteces, Slate, Fink, Fitzroy, all great... Overall, everything works together perfectly, and I couldn't ask for anything better, absolutely well-made, 10/10, highly recommended!EDIT: as of Feb 6, 2016, I have played through this game multiple times, and its DLCs, and have collected every achievement to 100%, so you can take my word for it, I have played everything thoroughly ;)			"

												Short summary: best story in Bioshock games so far, but worst gameplay.First, I will list everything that went wrong with Bioshock Infinite: Levels are mostly linear: just run and gun from point A to B, very little incentive to explore. There are no level maps. With the ability to ride sky lines, Bioshok Infinite is literally a rail shooter.In rare cases when you find some ""secret"" stuff, game lists it as a secondary objective: ""you found a closed box, go look for the key"". Thankfully, there's no path marker leading to the key.No combination locks. Instead you pick up generic lockpicks and use them to unlock any locked door or safe. There's one door locked with obligatory 0451 code, but it's opened in a cutscene without player's input. You can only carry two weapons. If you run out of ammo for both equipped guns, you're forced to run around the battlefield and search for a new weapon to swap or sit in cover and wait until Elizabeth throws a loaded weapon at you. There is only one ammo type per weapon. Weapons and their upgrades are more boring now: ordinary pistols, shotguns, grenade launchers etc. Upgrades do not change how the weapon looks. No more crazy revolvers with two cylinders, electric shotguns and spear launchers.No passive tonics. Partially replaced by gear, but it's limited to four slots total: hat, shirt, pants and boots, with no ability to increase this limit. Also you cannot mix and match any effects as you wish, as every gear piece can only be equipped in its designated slot.No first aid kits or EVE hypos. When you're getting low on health in a fight you're have to drop everything and run around searching for a tear with health packs or you're dead. The're a small shield that regenerates when not under attack, but enemies destroy it in couple of hits (on hard difficulty at least).No vita chambers. You're probably wondering why is it a bad thing - it's because in previous two games vita chambers could be disabled in settings. In Infinite you have no choice but to accept your ""revival"" and lose money in the process. There are no manual saves anymore too, so there are no reasonable way to bypass that if you liked to play without vita chambers before.  Hacking was removed. There's a plasmid (or vigour, how they call them here) that serves a similar purpose, but it only works for a short time and huge drain on salt (EVE). Using it on a vending machine makes it drop a small amount of money instead of decreasing sell prices.I'm still recommending to play Bioshock Infinite for the story - it's worth it regardless of shooting mechanics and exploration. Just set the difficulty to easy, don't repeat my mistake.			"

												BioShock Infinite is an artistic masterpiece. Beautiful, suspenseful, and haunting at times; it captures a blending of history and myth to create something both wonderfully unique and familiar. Elizabeth is one of the best characters to ever appear in a game and the world is beautiful.Story: 10/10 As we all come to expect from Irrational, the plot of this game is bursting with rich parallels, powerful emotional imagery and an ending (brilliantly foreshadowed throughout) that will leave you both satisfied and begging for more. Ambiance: 10/10 This is where the game really shines. Each set-piece alone could be a work of art, each architectural blend, each cultural costume. All of the visual splendor mixed together with a score that perfectly juxtaposes the glamor and grit of what Columbia represents. Gamplay: 10/10 I expected a rich story and beautiful visuals/music, what I did not expect was game-play (particularly combat) that surpassed Irrationals previous games in terms of enjoyment and dynamic action. This game takes everything that we loved from previous BioShock games and adds a whole new level of tactical planning and on the fly improvisation. Each combat area is a stage set for a brilliant play, each enemy adding new challenge, each weapon a chance to master. Never has combat been so challenging and satisfying in a BioShock game.			"

												9/10""As you can see, Booker, the inmates run the asylum."" Four years on from its release this game is still a gem, proving to be a pyschological thriller with mystifying twists and turns. While some of the game does lag and is noticeably boring in parts, the eventual tying of the story in of itself, and to the Bioshock franchise as a whole, is thoroughly well thought out and expertly crafted. Bioshock unlike most other games allows players the freedom and diversity of a well equiped arsenal that can be upgraded, leading to you changing your approach in dealing with different foes. The graphics are beautiful and not at all dated; while the textures and lighting are also superb. The game feels easier than Bioshock 1 and 2 and, Elizabeth, plays her part in this by routinely finding you ammo and coins to stock up on. That said the final fights of the game are much more challenging. If you pay £10 or under for this game you've found yourself a bargain.			"

												I'd been saving this game until I got an upgraded PC that could run it on high settings because I'd heard it was beautiful and I didn't want to rob myself of part of the experience. It was true, Columbia is beautiful. I'd also heard this was the greatest BioShock of all. Unfortunately, I found the content to be lackluster. This game was good, but I don't think it's a classic. At several points I found myself asking, ""What's so-and-so's motivation here?"" For me that's always a bad sign. Normally, I love timebending twists and turns but here I just found it convoluted and disjointed. And that's even after additional playthroughs so I could really understand what happened. The story quality is definitely a step up from BioShock 2 but falls short of equaling BioShock 1.The combat should be much more open compared to 1 and 2 because you're on a floating city in the sky versus battling in sunken city hallways but instead it ended up feeling boring.Also the achievement for a total stealth playthrough of Burial at Sea - Episode 2 is called ""Taffer's Delight"" and that's just swell.

												(9 from 10)Bioshock:Infinite was more in the vein what I had originally wanted from Bioshock 1. And here is why: 1.	It shows the high times of this unique society and its downfall. Unlike the first Bioshock, were you pretty much arrive when most people already left, or died or gone complete crazy.2.	You had a sweet and helpful companion with you (Elizabeth), which in my book is always a plus.3.	It had an interesting ending overall. While you had an extraordinary revelation during mid/endgame of Bioshock 1. The real ending of Bioshock 1 was as generic as it gets.4.	Skyhooks added a certain variety to the generic shooting experience in Bioshock 1. They tried that in Bioshock 1 by adding odd minigames.5.	Graphics are improved, still you often see for which platform it was aimed for (Protip: It was not the PC). They worked with graphical tricks to improve memory management and sometimes it gets ugly.So If not just like to kill some time, but get emotionally involved into an unusual game and its world, you should give it a try!

												I ran out of words for how amazing and groundbreaking this game is. Oh, wait, I just used a few. It didn't impress a lot, but it sure did impress me. Very few games offer a narrative so engaging and so involving. Gameplay felt smooth and the writing was good enough for me to keep guessing what is what and who is who, until it finally revealed itself like a blooming flower. Also, one of the few games that actually offered an amazing DLC. Usually, by the time I play a DLC for a game, I would have lost interest in what it had to offer, but not with this one, I assure you. Just be sure to get the whole pack for it. and yes, I recommend it. At full price. Not on a sale. Worth.			"

												I had very few issues with this game. There were a few times when it felt as though I was being spoon-fed the plot; I didn't feel rushed, but the narrative of the game pulled very strongly. That being said, I think it was appropriate and ultimately well-handled. The characters were quite believable, the combat was engaging, and the story went places I never could have expected. BioShock Infinite is one of the best games I've played since... well, since BioShock 1, actually.			"

												Bioshock Infinite is absolutely amazing, the shere attention to detail and the gripping story made all the time spent looking in every corner of every random lane and fighting wave after wave of interesting (but occaisionally dull) enemies a blast and had justified the 20+ hours I have spent on this game. I found the story in the beginning a bit slow and uneventful, but the bright and glamorous world made up for that with interesting dialogue, spoken by the people lining the streets and the great showcase of the indoctrination of the people by Father Comstock. As the story/game progresses things change dramatically, throwing in plenty of combat and spicing up the story perfectly.After ruthlessly slaughtering countless numbers of enemies I found the combat got a bit dull, and in a way a bit easy after getting most of the upgrades and new weapons/vigors. The enemies are also a bit on the bland side, since most of them are just a darkish colour and little detail on the uniforms I found my self killing what I thought was the same person over and over again, this was especially prevalent towards the end of the game.The combat incorperates a lot of 'fantasy' into it, with things like Vigors and more modern guns with a little less realism and less punch. The physics of the weapons felt great too, they were not way too unrealistic but they weren't too reaslistic either, which provided a nice blend making those heads look as bigger target as always. If I were to have 1 major complaint about the guns it would be how underpowered some guns can be towards the end of the game, where I ran out of ammo for  my sniper and had only a pistol as a replacement. The pistol been my main weapon at the beginning of the game and could take down enemies in what felt like 1 blow, but the pistol had no such effect when taking down the same enemies later on, making one have to completely spray all their ammo at the opponents head to actually take them down.At the end of the story things get very weird and confusing but when the game ends, most previous events in the game begin to come together, but some do not leading to a lot of confusion and possibly sequels (?). The end left me wanting to play again, so that I can find all those little events that link to the main plot and then giggle, thinking about ""how could I have not noticed this before?""This game is one of a small ammount of games that have left me happy and satisfied at the end, and I can definately see myself playing it again sometime in the future. To get a game this great for only $10 was itself amazing. I have seen games that cost a lot more and has been realeased a lot earlier, that are absolutely terrible. Overall I believe Bioshock Infinite to be well worth the time and money, and that Irration games & 2K have done an exellent job, creating what is probably, a masterpiece. I would definately recommend getting this game, and I guarantee (A guarantee? Who has time for all that paperwork?)  you will have fun!  I give it a 10/10			"

												Bioshock Infinite is one of the best games ever constructed.  If you like shooters with an interesting story, then you’re bound to like this game.  I don’t play shooters very often, but Bioshock Infinite is a game that I can play again and again.Pro:- Richly detailed world- Believable characters- Unique combat- A few puzzles to solves- Optional side missions- Lengthily game play- Engaging storyline- Plot twistCons:- Only one ending, but it’s the right one.The original Bioshock was a fantastic game, but Infinite eclipsed it.  At the time of this review, Bioshock Infinite was selling for $29.99.  Well worth it in my opinion.  If you want to wait for a sale, by all means, but I think it’s worth $30.			"

												I've had some time to think about this game, and here are my overall thoughts. (SPOILER-FREE)Bioshock Infinite is at its core an average single-player shooter game. However, this is not what compelled me to pick it up. I picked this game up for around 10 bucks during the Steam Black Friday sale, hearing that the story was excellent, and far better than what you'd see in an everyday shooter. After about a month of letting it sit in my library, I gave it a try. Damn, were my friends right. The story is what MADE the game. The world of Colombia is sprawling and full of life, which is surprising due to the subject matter. The character of Elizabeth gave the game heart and a way to convey its story through someone else's eyes, rather than the focused and violent sight of Mr. Booker Dewitt. The ending left me speechless, and I talked to my friends about it for hours. I tried the other Bioshocks, but they were not even close to the fun I had with Infinite. They were far too dark and overall lacked the polish of Infinite. Infinite's choice of a lighter atmosphere and a gripping story reeled me in and gave me an overall great experience. It was worth every penny.			"

												Love Bioshock! Played all releases and never been disappointed.  This instalment of Infinite is just great, some many changes from the first two, but highly enjoyable and graphically sound.Story is very complex and a little hard to understand or picture, but if you get the DLC's especially Ep1 & 2 BAS then this will explain better, and blow your mind.If you like FPS and played Bioshock 1&2 then get it, you won’t regret it. If you’re new to Bioshock then playing this first is ok.  I would recommend purchasing all editions to benefit the story and references of characters.Just Awesome! "

												I've always been a fan of the Bioshock series and irrational games as a company, I even thought Bioshock 2, made by 2K was a great game, not as good as the others in the series but definitely worth your time.March 2013, the release of Bioshock: Infinite.Who knew, that a game could have such an emotional pull on someone. That it could make you feel and care for the characters, so much that you would be thinking about them, worrying for them and doing everything in your humanly power to make sure that everything went the way you wanted it too. That is the feeling Bioshock: Infinite will bring to you and anyone who plays this game and truly immerses themselves in the story, putting yourself in the shoes of Booker Dewitt and getting the feeling that these in game events are actually happening and that you are involved.This is the best game in the Bioshock series, without a doubt, simple things like the main character being able to speak and having a companion,to huge things like the world being fueled by slavery, racism and capitalism, not to mention the fact that the game is absolutely stunning visually and the added feature of zipping through parts of columbia on sky hooks and landing on enemies heads to send them flying through the air and off the map are all features that make this game such a unique and mind blowing experience.The characters are amazing, the gameplay is easy to pick up and the story is the best story I have ever experienced in a game, the link up with the city in the sky Columbia to the underwater utopia that is Rapture is special and the added DLC of Burial at Sea parts 1 and 2 that bring the Bioshock series to a close, is some of the finest storytelling that not just gaming has ever seen, ENTERTAINMENT has ever seen (Yes better than TLOU).In short, buy this game and play it, I have completed this game 3 times already on the Xbox (where my original playthroughs are) completed all the DLC, and I fully expect to be going back to play this game time and time again, I 100% hope this isn't the end of Bioshock as a series, but if it is, all I can say is it has been an amazing journey, and Bioshock sits at the top of my most treasured games list and will for a long time.

												This game is a contendor for Game of The Year only for its story, the gameplay is subpar. The Story is as you come to expect from the creators of Bioshock, you wander around a city for awhile trying to complete a goal that will lead you to the big twist at the end of the game. It was done very well because of the voice acting, pacing, writing, and its impact. However, the gameplay was extremely boring. First off, all you did was verse the same 2 enemy types that never change over the course of the 17 hour campaign. Then you have the vigors , which are explained in a cool way but are just various forms of stun that distract the enemy for about half a second. The Handymen  and the Motorized Patriots were sad attempts at trying to recreate the Big Daddy that didn't offer any reward. Next, you can only carry 2 weapons that never seem to have enough ammo and make you feel underpowered. Finally you can't carry salts or health packs, so when you run out you have to wait for Elizabeth to ""fetch"" you some. If you like a good storybased game then i would recommand this game for you. But if your a fps junky then this game will annoy you too much to finish it.			"

												What a total waste of $$$ and time.  This is one of the worst games ever. I seriously tried to like this game. How did it sell so many copies? How did it get such great reviews?  These are just a couple of the questions i asked myself while playing this game. Maybe it is just because i played the first 2 Bioshock games, but i doubt it. I feel like the game was a quick job to get alot of money from a known franchise. This game is nothing like the first 2.If you played Bioshock 1 & 2 and loved playing them, then avoid this game if you can. Although, if you've played Bioshock 1 & 2, you may feel compelled to finish the story. I think you will be seriously disapointed in this sequel for everything except the story.  Play the first Bioshock if you've never played before. This game will ruin it for you			"

This game comes out of the gates hot with its hype and irrefutable beauty; which apparently is all you need to sell a game these days. Anyone who has played previous Bioshocks can tell you that Ken Levine can't write an ending to save his life, and this game is only different than its predecessors in as it falls from greater heights at a much earlier point in the story. As fast as the characters' qualities and personalities are developed they are confused and lost. Pepare for all your questions of the mysteries of this game to be answered by questions and those questions to be answered with riddles so vague that you could comfortably fill in the blanks yourself out of confusion and a desire to know what is not there; but I'm not biting.  Its a cup and ball trick story, whichever cup you choose you can be sure that the real answer is in Levine's pocket.  "

												A must-play!One of the least glitchy games I've played.I bought it and played it only a few days after launch and was surprised by the amount of polish.Emotionally poked the cockles of my heart with the greatest side-kick ever since Alyx Vance of Half-Life 2.Not gonna mention much in this review as it has already been hyped to epic proportions.Disappointments:Obviously no game is without flaws.Infinite felt a bit rushed in terms of the story especially at the end.Some elements of the plot and characters seem to be just thrown in the later bits.A certain character turns against you much too soon which made it an anti-climax.The writers/devs are much better than that.Other stuff:Being a Christian myself,I was happy to see a piece of media brave enough to question the tendency of humans to follow certain religions blindly without questioning the chaos they cause.The primary antagonist is the perfect portrayal of what a person is capable of doing in the name of religion.I just hope people don't forget that there are actual sensible Christians around but I digress.Kudos for questioning the authority of those with the most selfish of ambitions currently in power.Skoar: 9/10 pootis points			"

The only complaint i have is that you can only carry 2 guns, while in the DLC you can carry allll of them in a spinny thing just like vigors/plasmids. I really enjoy the enviroment the game is set in as well, its beautifully vintage while still being allll kinds of futuristic when it comes to the technology behind the floating city and the machines that create tears. idk if that was a spoiler or not lol but this game is amazing and a good time to play. You even get to feel the relationship develop between Booker and Elizabeth which im very fond of in games. Character development is a big deal to me and this game definitely delivered.			"

												They say there is no such thing as a perfect game, but BioShock Infinite certainly almost makes it. Thrown into a submersive plot, in a beautiful but deadly world, BioShock Infinite pushes the boundaries by not keeping to traditional gaming writing.Full of twists and turns, shocks and surprises, tears and emotion, this game feels as if you are not playing it, but rather experiencing it.And that doesn't even scratch the surface of this game. You are accompanied by the amazing Elizabeth through out. With the most amazing AI I have ever seen in a game, Elizabeth feels more like a human than a string of code....BioShock Infinite is a huge step up from the original BioShock, and is the sequel it truly deserves...If you read other reviews for this, and see words like ""unmissable"", ""fantastic"" or ""amazing"" they are not lying...10/10 Game of the year, Game of the generation, and quite possibly the game of my life...

												At first I only bought this game when it was on sale because my brother suggested it to me but now it's one of my favorite games ever. The story is great, the gameplay is great. There really isn't anything I don't like about this game. I recommend people to buy this game for the ending alone. Trust me, it's good.  "

												Without a doubt the best storytelling in a game. I'm more than grateful that I spent $40.00 for this game, because I got the biggest emotional and sympathical experience in BioShock: Infinite than any other game before.10/10Pros+Immersive storytelling+Great PC port with a wide variety of graphical options+Interesting characters+INCREDIBLE voice actingThough an almost perfect game does have some cons-Boring weapon variety-Boring weapon upgrades-FOV slider only goes to about 85Buy it and trust me, you'll have a great time with it.

Set in Columbia, an impossible floating city comprised of a multitude of structures, Bioshock Infinite approaches a similar layout to the first game in the series-not taking into account the System Shock video games-and redefines it from a horror-based open-world story set in the underwater city of Rapture to a more linear swashbuckling adventure with intricate combat sequences as well as platforming elements. I understand that a lot of individuals who favored the first game did so because of very specific ideals-myself being one of them-but I must admit that Bioshock Infinite is still a solid, enjoyable experience; they are both special in their own ways, and should both be given a chance. You play as Booker Dewitt as he travels to said city of Columbia in search of a young woman, Elizabeth, whom he plans to hand over to wipe away a debt he owes; this results in an exciting tale of hardship and intense action.Here are just a few of the features that I enjoyed about Bioshock Infinite:Theme - I am not one to hold a ‘controversial’ theme to my heart because I understand completely that the developers had no intension of offending anyone, so whoever protests “racism” toward this title can listen to one of my favorite Eagles songs titled Get Over It. Most of Columbia’s history melds closely around issues similar to the Civil War, when African American citizens were identified as property, so Bioshock Infinite utilizes the concept of slavery to demonize the majority of citizens and ruling party throughout the game. Comstock chooses African Americans as a favored enemy-therefore receiving a bonus to all attack a damage rolls when facing against them in combat (Dungeons and Dragons joke, do not mind me)-and believes them to be an impure race; this, as well as religious affiliations, paints a majority of individuals within Columbia whom endlessly idolize Comstock as members of a blind faith, and believe him to be some sort of messiah. This hook (pun intended) is a twisted yet interesting one to exploit since the first Bioshock game also features few pseudohistorical references.  Along with the cast of this game, the theme develops into quite a gripping tale unlike many.Gameplay - The key feature that separates Infinite from other ‘Shock’ titles is the swashbuckling gameplay revolving around the Skyhook. With the ability to magnetize to hanging rails above, this new item allows the player to melee strike without the need to switch weapons, perform executions on damaged enemies, and even adds an element of platforming to the fray. Vigors reappear within Infinite’s story but modify play as an addition to combat such as in previous Bioshock titles. Fluid gameplay is also included in this installment, though players may only carry two weapons at a time; though this is one of the newer features to the ‘Shock’ games, it is also one which previous fanatics did not enjoy due to it too closely resembling a modern first person shooter title while also shying away from the first game. Overall, despite its minor setbacks in its combat system, Bioshock Infinite’s gameplay blends very well with story elements and sequences.(Partially) Open World - Though certain sections are closed off after specific story progressions, Bioshock Infinite permits the player to backtrack through previous segments to loot silver dollars-the currency in this title-, health and salt boosts, and to finish side quests, which generally direct players off-route in order to gain other helpful advances. This system is just open enough to fit the swashbuckling style without sacrificing story elements.Clothing/Perk System - Within the numerous actions Booker Dewitt can perform are an array of combination attacks and tactics; however, a player may become too accustomed to one set of combat maneuvers to attempt any of the other functions of the games such as the Skyhook’s flying melee attack. This is where the clothing system comes into play. Clothing acts as a perk or upgrade system since various actions-such as said Skyhook drop-can be modified to obtain additional effects. For example, there is an article of clothing that grants all of the player’s melee attacks chained electrical damage as well as the base melee damage, which would entice players to attempt using melee attacks more frequently. This system, though, could be considered a double-edged blade as it may also provoke players to adopt new strategies or cause them to become dependent on a specific set of upgrades and, subsequently, actions; either way, it is an interesting concept.1999 Mode - Unlocked after completing the game’s campaign at least once, 1999 mode offers a challenge to players that seek it. In this mode, players take increased damage from enemy attacks and the respawn system is dramatically altered in that you lose one hundred silver dollars when you die. Not being able to pay this fee upon death means losing all progress in the current save slot. This offers a fun and challenging experience to those that believe they have mastered this game and wish to juggle expenses between vending machines and life itself.TL:DR - It is difficult  to say what has already been said about this award-winning title. Bioshock Infinite blends well with the gameplay of its predecessors while also retaining some original elements, as well as telling an outstanding story packed with intense action, twists, and sorrow. Infinite is certainly a title to explore if you have not done so, prior fanatic to the series or not. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews?

Bioshock Infinite is my absolute favorite game of all time. No other story I have seen has managed to do what infinite does. An essential part of the experience is the DLC, Burial at Sea 1 & 2. You have to play those. If you don't, you are missing a tremendous part of the story and experience. Especially episode 2. It's one of the most moving experiences I have ever had. Some people may not like this game, for some reason,  but if you like an amazing story, characters, and a ton of fun, pick this up. You won't forget it.			"

												Here is a great game. Good story ( Even though its hard to grasp at first) and Beautiful visuals. I can't stress that enough. I hope the first sentence is enough to get you guys to buy the game. Anyways, Pros*Good story and character development. *Gorgeous visuals and vibrant colors. *A game world which is alive. *Elizabeth is not another ""Damesel in distress"" and is very helpful and supportive (And does not block your path like   Lydia in Skyrim :3) *♥♥♥♥ing sky hook. Cons*Enemy Ai spots you instantly (Even with the gear sometimes) and makes sneaking pointless. *It lacks a manual save system. *Melee combat feels a little dull.*Game feels a bit linear.And the biggest problem is that you have to purchase the DLC to experience the whole story. Mind you I am not saying that the game is a half cooked meal or anything like that. But because the DLC ties in with the original bioshock.   Thats all I have to say. GLHF :)			"

												One of the best game i've ever played.I'm not gonna go too far in graphics, because i play it on my crappy laptop, at low settings, but still, the graphics were pretty goods, i still can see in-depth details, blend together with the overall scenery. And yeah, it's good to play without spme serious lag (LoL).About the storyline. I gotta say after the ending, i was like: ""WTF just happend?"" Seriously, after finishing the game, it took me a few hours to dig deep in the BioShock wiki, as well as listening back the voxophones over and over again. Also, throughout the game, there're also a few plot twists that I couldn't understand clearly. I really have to play the game again to understand further the ending (mind♥♥♥♥ simulator LoL).Gameplay? At first, i was astonished by the scenery of Columbia, the old 1912 steampunk style got me right in the first place. I mean, what could be better than a gunfight in the old, classic environment, along with some crazy vigors? The AI is easy to beat, but they are challenging enough in order for you not to beat them so easily. They surely will bring you some real satisfaction after winning a gunfight. The sounds in general a pretty well designed in the game, brings you the experience of a 1912 setting, but also include some modern soundtracks.Characters design maybe is one of the main factor that made the game so awesome, from Booker, Elizabeth, the Comstocks, Songbird,.... Everyone in the game has something unique, together, they give you an unforgettable experience, from their appearance, to their inner feelings.Overall, if you're considering bringing this game into your library , I suggest you stop it, and, you know, just buy the game already. You definitely won't regret it. 10/10 recommended.			"

												Whatever I write doesn't give justice to how good this game actually is. Where do I even start?Bioshock Infinite will make you feel and I stand by this claim.The storyline is so complex and wonderfully written it will make you think about this title even long after you finish it. My hat is off to Mr. Ken Levine.Scenery is beautiful, you will try to experience every little corner of Colombia.Soundtrack is on point, it enhances the experience of whatever is happening wonderfully.Voice actors are top notch, Courtnee and Troy did a phenomenal job to make Elizabeth and Booker come to life.AI is intelligent. Elizabeth is superb.I would say watch  Creating Elizabeth  to see how much depth this character has.If you're thinking about whether or not you should be playing this game, the answer is yes. Everyone should play through it at least once. It's a masterpiece.			"

												This game is a contendor for Game of The Year only for its story, the gameplay is subpar. The Story is as you come to expect from the creators of Bioshock, you wander around a city for awhile trying to complete a goal that will lead you to the big twist at the end of the game. It was done very well because of the voice acting, pacing, writing, and its impact. However, the gameplay was extremely boring. First off, all you did was verse the same 2 enemy types that never change over the course of the 17 hour campaign. Then you have the vigors , which are explained in a cool way but are just various forms of stun that distract the enemy for about half a second. The Handymen  and the Motorized Patriots were sad attempts at trying to recreate the Big Daddy that didn't offer any reward. Next, you can only carry 2 weapons that never seem to have enough ammo and make you feel underpowered. Finally you can't carry salts or health packs, so when you run out you have to wait for Elizabeth to ""fetch"" you some. If you like a good storybased game then i would recommand this game for you. But if your a fps junky then this game will annoy you too much to finish it.			"

												What a total waste of $$$ and time.  This is one of the worst games ever. I seriously tried to like this game. How did it sell so many copies? How did it get such great reviews?  These are just a couple of the questions i asked myself while playing this game. Maybe it is just because i played the first 2 Bioshock games, but i doubt it. I feel like the game was a quick job to get alot of money from a known franchise. This game is nothing like the first 2.If you played Bioshock 1 & 2 and loved playing them, then avoid this game if you can. Although, if you've played Bioshock 1 & 2, you may feel compelled to finish the story. I think you will be seriously disapointed in this sequel for everything except the story.  Play the first Bioshock if you've never played before. This game will ruin it for you			"

												Normally I'm not the shooter loving guy. For me they are too repetitive and sometomes boring. But not this game! Despite you plunge right into the story and it's kind of hard to follow sometimes, at least there is a story. And not a bad one either!My most favorite thing about this game is the incredible setting and the dense atmosphere: a flying city, seems kind of odd, but works out and looks great!In addition to this a have to say, that the grafics are just okay and in comparison to titles from 2013 and years before kind of outdated. But still for the comic-like-look of this game totally acceptable.So all in all my pros are: incredible setting  atmosphere Elisabeth (great innovation for a shooter) story soundtrack did I say GREAT SETTING?!?? variety of guns, enemies, locations.Cons: controls are just so-so outdated grafics sometimes you get caught on corners or thing which would indeed tumble overUpdate:This game has some serious stories to tell. Man, it's art!! Kind of hard to follow but damn that end totally amazed and puzzled me!! Great!			"

												Bioshock Infinite is one of the best games ever constructed.  If you like shooters with an interesting story, then you’re bound to like this game.  I don’t play shooters very often, but Bioshock Infinite is a game that I can play again and again.Pro:- Richly detailed world- Believable characters- Unique combat- A few puzzles to solves- Optional side missions- Lengthily game play- Engaging storyline- Plot twistCons:- Only one ending, but it’s the right one.The original Bioshock was a fantastic game, but Infinite eclipsed it.  At the time of this review, Bioshock Infinite was selling for $29.99.  Well worth it in my opinion.  If you want to wait for a sale, by all means, but I think it’s worth $30.			"

												I've had some time to think about this game, and here are my overall thoughts. (SPOILER-FREE)Bioshock Infinite is at its core an average single-player shooter game. However, this is not what compelled me to pick it up. I picked this game up for around 10 bucks during the Steam Black Friday sale, hearing that the story was excellent, and far better than what you'd see in an everyday shooter. After about a month of letting it sit in my library, I gave it a try. Damn, were my friends right. The story is what MADE the game. The world of Colombia is sprawling and full of life, which is surprising due to the subject matter. The character of Elizabeth gave the game heart and a way to convey its story through someone else's eyes, rather than the focused and violent sight of Mr. Booker Dewitt. The ending left me speechless, and I talked to my friends about it for hours. I tried the other Bioshocks, but they were not even close to the fun I had with Infinite. They were far too dark and overall lacked the polish of Infinite. Infinite's choice of a lighter atmosphere and a gripping story reeled me in and gave me an overall great experience. It was worth every penny.			"

												Love Bioshock! Played all releases and never been disappointed.  This instalment of Infinite is just great, some many changes from the first two, but highly enjoyable and graphically sound.Story is very complex and a little hard to understand or picture, but if you get the DLC's especially Ep1 & 2 BAS then this will explain better, and blow your mind.If you like FPS and played Bioshock 1&2 then get it, you won’t regret it. If you’re new to Bioshock then playing this first is ok.  I would recommend purchasing all editions to benefit the story and references of characters.Just Awesome! "

												I've always been a fan of the Bioshock series and irrational games as a company, I even thought Bioshock 2, made by 2K was a great game, not as good as the others in the series but definitely worth your time.March 2013, the release of Bioshock: Infinite.Who knew, that a game could have such an emotional pull on someone. That it could make you feel and care for the characters, so much that you would be thinking about them, worrying for them and doing everything in your humanly power to make sure that everything went the way you wanted it too. That is the feeling Bioshock: Infinite will bring to you and anyone who plays this game and truly immerses themselves in the story, putting yourself in the shoes of Booker Dewitt and getting the feeling that these in game events are actually happening and that you are involved.This is the best game in the Bioshock series, without a doubt, simple things like the main character being able to speak and having a companion,to huge things like the world being fueled by slavery, racism and capitalism, not to mention the fact that the game is absolutely stunning visually and the added feature of zipping through parts of columbia on sky hooks and landing on enemies heads to send them flying through the air and off the map are all features that make this game such a unique and mind blowing experience.The characters are amazing, the gameplay is easy to pick up and the story is the best story I have ever experienced in a game, the link up with the city in the sky Columbia to the underwater utopia that is Rapture is special and the added DLC of Burial at Sea parts 1 and 2 that bring the Bioshock series to a close, is some of the finest storytelling that not just gaming has ever seen, ENTERTAINMENT has ever seen (Yes better than TLOU).In short, buy this game and play it, I have completed this game 3 times already on the Xbox (where my original playthroughs are) completed all the DLC, and I fully expect to be going back to play this game time and time again, I 100% hope this isn't the end of Bioshock as a series, but if it is, all I can say is it has been an amazing journey, and Bioshock sits at the top of my most treasured games list and will for a long time.

												If all you want is a pretty game with decent gameplay and don't care about / don't pay attention to story, in terms of for example dramatic pacing or coherence, then BioInf is the game for you. Otherwise you may want to read this review to contrast the fanboy fawning from the industry and previous fans of the series.This is my opinion: BioInf is a beautiful game, with mediocre gameplay where longer healthbars simulate difficulty, and a story that pretends to be deep while it's really mostly pretentious, chopped up, and doesn't ""handle"" and of the issues it briefly touches on. I could write you an essay about all the plot flaws; examples being blatantly ignoring huge character events, having Booker act like a total retard (and I mean extra everything total retard even in game terms) to make the story even more convoluted, and not keeping to their own in-universe laws. They introduce story elements like travel in time and between worlds in the multiverse, but don't seem to take into account the obvious consequences; for example, why does Booker assume that if they pass into a new world, his old deal with someone would be valid over there? And concerning all the deep issues it handles; you get hammered by racism, then all the black people go murderbrawl and you have to mindlessly shoot them all, is that what people mean by the game ""handling big and important issues""?Now, I don't think BioInf is a worthless game; it can be fun at times. The intro is fantastically beautiful, for example. But if the question is simply: did I think it was worth my time and money spent? then my answer is no. The original idea of this game may have been brilliant, and the story complex and beautiful, but it feels like it's been compromised too many times in development, and consequently can't hold itself together. It may have benefited from not taking up quite so many ""deep and important issues"" and not branching out into quite so many things. It ends up trying very hard to be something it isn't: a good story.			"

												This review is more about preference than quality.This was a tough one for me, as the visuals and presentation were outstanding, but sadly there is a lot wrong with this game, and it's all in the gameplay. I'll start by saying that all of the amazing things shown in the E3 demos was cut for some reason and replaced by more basic and less interesting content.The game itself is extremely linear run-and-gun, but slower and less convenient. Rather than explore a city, you get locked into small arenas with a circular railway circuit and are forced to fight a number of respawning enemies until a timer runs out and you're allowed to leave.The complexity of levels is comparable to more faster-paced, more straightforward shooters like Serious Sam, but scaled up in size immensely, which while looks impressive, also means it takes ages to move down pretty basic paths. Exploration involves backtracking miles to find secret buttons or clues, meaning a bad hunch can waste over 20 minutes of walking (which happened to me a few times).Combat is run-and-gun, but slowed down with combat mechanics that are interesting at first (and I'm sure many gamers would love it), but for me gets jarring and annoying quickly. You get Elizabeth to spawn in infinite ammo boxes, minor barricades or friendly versions of NPCs to distract enemies (and no escape routes or secret passages as previously planned). You then use a basic 'stun' attack with the vigors and then shoot the enemy in their weak spot to kill them, and you have to do this a LOT and the pace of the game gets annoyingly slow as a result. Because you are expected very strongly to use the vigors, the guns are extremely unreliable. To make matters worse, you have only two weapon slots, you can only switch guns with dropped weapons, and ammo can completely vanish in certain areas, with many areas that strongly lean towards specific weapon types- which skews gameplay in many annoying and frustrating ways.Story was ok-ish, and the presentation of the story was certainly excellent. But again, compared to the trailers, nowhere near as good. The vibrant living atmosphere of a city full of paranoid psychos where Booker tries his best to blend in at his own peril when they could turn on him any minute? Wasn't there. After the opening sequence, the streets are deserted for the rest of the game except for the badguys (police or rebels) waiting to fight you and its a standard first-person shooter. Another problem is the majority of the story is delivered solely via voxophones (audio logs), which are mostly hidden and easily interrupted by scripted character speech, meaning the player must wait for a quiet spot, turn it on, and just sit around listening to it. Some in-world spoken information is easy to miss by being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Overall, it's very easy to miss what is going on.Overall, it was a pity, as it could have been outstanding, and there is nothing in the game that is legitimately botched or crappy, and to its further credit, the drawbacks I listed were all fairly ambitious ideas and mechanics that I think many people will love (that I simply didn't), and never to poor or unimaginative design that plagues many other games. If you think an approach like this, or a theatrical experience, is worthwhile in itself, and don't mind the gameplay style, then certainly buy it, if you're like me- maybe not.			"

The gameplay is unique and is very well done. Many combinations to use to fit your style. There isn't much to really learn throughout the game, it is a very simple gameplay experience and works so well. It is one of my favorite games of all time.

												There are a lot of positive reviews for this game, which was initially what compelled me to purcahse it upon release. It was praised for its ""excellent story"" and immersive qualities. While it does have a decently gripping plot, Bioshock Infinite suffers from lack of gameplay quality. Enough so that I would not recommend this game to most players.Bioshock Infinite holds a scary resemblence to Assassin's Creed (the first one) not in the sense that the setting or story are the same, but both have a great story and terrible gameplay. Like in Assassin's Creed, Bioshock Infinite has you doing the same things in the same scenarios over and over again while trying to switch it up by adding new elements to the same system. This repetitive style of development is completely transparent after your first handful of encounters and while not even halfway through the game, you can tell there is no end in sight to the repetition. In order to get through the plot, one has to hack and slash one's way through the dull gameplay; an uphill battle from which I chose to retreat from after about a third of the way into the game.I applaud both Bioshock Infinite and Assassin's Creed for their efforts in storytelling, as it's a quality that is severely lacking in the video game industry and rarely explored. The Assassin's Creed team learned from their mistakes and hit a homerun with their second installment, Assassin's Creed II. Hopefully the Bioshock team will also learn from theirs and create a game that can tell a riveting tale as well as engage the player. However, Bioshock Infinite simply does not cut it.			"

Posted: March 26, 2014
												First of all I want to start off by saying I am a huge fan of the Bioshock series and fell in love with System Shock a long, long time ago. I can recommend this game if only for the story. This has by far been the most disappointing entry in the series for me. Let's get to the basics shall we?-Structure: One of the biggest let downs of the title. While there have always been directives and objectives and overall goals sewn into the games, this one follows one core goal to the next in a very linear fashion compared to the others. You have a mission and there isn't any deviating or experimenting afoot, you might have a few instances where you can veer off briefly and grab a new piece of clothing or boost,  but these opportunities are few and far between. You have one autosave checkpoint to the next and if by God for some reason you were to get lost, a simple tap of the up on the Dpad will paint a line showing you where to go next. It's essentially a strict path to follow from one story bullet to the next. 4/10-Game play: Another disappointing occurrence in what could have been something amazing. The game play in this title is never fully actualized or as fleshed out as it could have been. What you have is a sprawling city atop the clouds and they're all intertwined and connected with these sky-lines. This game could have been as grand and diverse as the original Bioshock but what you essentially get is a connected roller coaster to fly on from one checkpoint to the next. The gun play leaves something to be desired, weapons feel different in their own right but the feeling has been lost from Bioshock. When you would round a corner and see a group of enemies or a Big Daddy and then mentally prepare on how to tackle it. You could lay down some mines or trip wire, stay close to a puddle of water to electrocute your prey and just have a variety of well planned destruction at your disposal. With this game all you really need to do is throw a bronco and or toss some grenades and empty your clip and wait for Elizabeth to toss you another needed resource. 6/10Presentation: This is where the game really shines and shows that if most things are lost in an Irrational title, they can still tell one hell of a story. What you're presented with is a story that dissects culture as we've come to know. A brainwashed patriotism powered by slavery and a bunch of other somewhat touchy areas throughout history. Racism is thrown up at every corner, and it feels like it fits for an early 1900's era.You can still see some of the overzealous Christian overtones and theme they shove down your throat, for story telling purposes. The graphics are beautiful and colorful with the vivid image of Red, White, and Blue painting the sky and interiors of all the places you'll come to see. While the story crosses into some nonsensical territory, overall it's brought to you in a beautiful way and I expected nothing less. The shining beacon of light in this game is the story so hang on every word it might be all you have or can take from it. 10/10Overall I'm not sure what you intend to take from this game, I wanted to love it, I really did but the story is the only basis I can recommend this title for. Your game time will stretch further than a lot of other FPS games will these days but that's it's job, after all it's Bioshock and not Call of Duty. If you bought this on sale you may very well get your money's worth, just see yourself as paying for a really damn good story. Just remember, there's always a lighthouse, there's always a man, and there's always a city. You'll know it when you need to.			"

												Don't let that Metascore fool you, this game is pretty bad.  If anything it is average at best.  Very linear, the sound sucks, graphics are pretty bad up close even on highest detail setting, the weapons are all just different variations of pistol, shotgun machine gun, and rocket launcher.  The different special abilites are all pretty much the same.  You can either use the ability as an attack or set a trap that stuns enemies.  The game ends up being VERY repetitive.  I do not recommend this game to anyone who would pay more than $5 for it.  I could go into more detail but seriously all you have to do is read the negative reviews and you'll get a very realistic explanation of what to expect from this game.  I'd give it a 4.5/10			"

												""10/10"" ""100%"" ""A+""Every review of this game (every. single. one) gave this game the highest marks in all of human history. Every review seems like the person reviewing the game actually lived in the Bioshock universe. Every review praised the story and gameplay for ""innovation"" and ""breaking boundries"" (look up a review and I will guarantee that they use those words). Bioshock Infinite was the most mediocre game I have ever played. It was more mediocre than every Call Of Duty game ever. (I haven't played Ghosts, but I think it will be better than Bioshock) I have a hard time comprehending the praise this game (or any Bioshock game) gets. As for the story or setting or whatever, it was average at best and just a bit stupid. The entire game was just navigating your way through a dumb, heavy handed, and tired message about how American Exceptionalism is bad. It's the video game equivalent of the guy standing next to some skyscraper in NYC holding wearing a sandwhich board listing all the evils of capitalism.			"

												Would I recommend this? Honestly, as much good as I heard about it before I played, I have to disagree with what I heard and say no. At best it's a mediocre experience. In every aspect it falls short of the original game, even with borrowed combat that manages to feel even worse than it did 5 years ago. After clearing area after area of bullet-sponge enemies, I really questioned how the combat tied into the story at all. Indeed, this game suffers because of this disconnect. The characters were honestly rather bland and I still didn't really care about them by the end of the game. Even the ending was rather under-done and felt like more of a cop-out than a well tailored finale.On a more positive note, the environment was done very well. Visually this game is pleasing and just as stunning as my first playthrough in Rapture from the original.Overall, this game was a big disappointment to see from such a good developer. If played without comparing it to the original Bioshock, it is a decent game but by no means a ""must-play."" I think 10 or 15 dollars is as much as this game is worth.			"

												An awesome game that you simply have to experience for yourself.It has an insanely deep atmosphere and it makes you really become a part of the game.That game was truly fun even at hard difficulty since it forced you to play slower, strategise a bit and save ammo.Also, the amount of hidden items that you can find is insane. Secret rooms, occasional side quests, money, lootableobjects, new upgrades for your character,... That's what was truly awesome about this game.Of course, I wasn't even talking about the story because the story is just a great piece of art. It stayed in game head days after I completed the game.Some people may find it quite repetitive and I have to agree with them. It is. But if you're the type of person who enjoysand doesn't mind repetitive games, then you must play this game while you're alive.Also, grab it on a sale so you won't regret paying 30€ just in case you didn't like it.I'd give this game a 10/10 but I can't. It wouldn't be fair.So I'll give it 10/10 for the story and 8/10 for the rest of the game mechanics.			"

												Bioshock games have always had the ability to tell strong stories and create impactful moments, but nothing that the studio has done before has come close to Infinite.You're thrown into a world where you ponder the sanity of the residents, you question your mission, and you gravitate slowly towards your companion. The long distance visuals are excellent, but the detail is lacking in the textures, making it feel more like a port than a PC game.You've always had your guns and your abilities in previous games, but never a companion like Elizabeth. She will help you in ways you've never been assisted in before, and you'll start taking her for granted. She's beautifully written and the work and detail put into her character brings her to life like never before seen in a video game.The biggest disappointment is the environment, almost nothing responds to you. Sure, you can walk by a couple and hear a quip, but try to enter nine out of every ten stores and you'll get a lovely low-res texture and a non-response. The environment feels rich in certain areas, like the opening sequence, and then completely dead in others. The action elements are pretty standard, but the story will leave you with many questions and plenty to ponder long after. It's a great discussion piece, and there are moments that can really stick with you.Overall, Bioshock is a beautiful game with beautiful moments. The story and characters elevate the weaker gameplay elements, and it's like living in an old movie. It's an unforgettable experience.			"

It's one of those games where you just wanna erase your memory and play it all again, and although I came late to the party by finishing this game pretty recently, it didn't matter. This game is a timeless effigy to the extent a game can make you feel and care for the characters and is a real testament to incredible gameplay and game design. Not only is it a great entry to the Bioshock series as a whole, it's a game that will always make you crack a smile when you see it in your library, remembering all the unexpected twists the story had (and how it made you ponder the ending for days afterward).Overall, Bioshock: Infinite is a requirement for anybody with even a slight video game interest and the SUPERIOR 'Infinite' game after the new COD was announced with the same name.  If I would rate it a number, it would be a solid 10/10			"

												One of the most over-rated games I've played in years. It feels like a step backwards for the series. So much of the game world is wide open, and yet so empty. The combat is bland and often unbalanced. I'm not convinced that the story is written very well, either (although if I explained why, I'd be spoiling it).The best thing I can say about it is that one scene very early on in the game was quite immersive and did a good job of making me feel very uncomfortable. The developers also did a good job of making escorting Elizabeth not feel like a chore; she generally stays out of the way during combat and even pops in to help when you're in trouble. Nevertheless, it's not enough to make the whole experience worthwhile.			"

												Talk about the perfect game...If you have not attained this beautiful masterpiece then you are missing out. It blows the other 2 bioshock games out of the water combined. The plot, action, scenery, mystery, and suspense will keep you playing this game until you either pass out in front of your computer or your console. I implore any gamer to buy Bioshock Infinite essentially if you haven't understood my pleas to make your wallet cry some more in protest. Booker DeWitt and Elizabeth's characters are so unique and engaging that it instantly captures ones attention and enthralls you. You play as the main character (DeWitt), and Elizabeth is your companion. You may be thinking ""Oh great another pointless npc who will get in the way."" WRONG Elizabeth is crucial to almost all aspects in the game including gun fights. To me, Elizabeth isn't just some pretty face or a damsel in distress--she is the best damn wingman to ever don a dress. There are also a wide variety of new guns and plasmids, err vigors, at your disposal to use that were very much needed in comparison to its' predecesors choice of weaponry. I will stop now before I reveal too much more as I could still go on about this game. Let me just reiterate that this is indeed well worth every last penny you put into this game. At the very least, you should give it a shot at some point in your life, even if you must borrow it from a friend. ~Buy. Now.~			"

												Leaving Andrew Ryan behind and scouring the figure of a comparable autocrat/antagonist for a new BioShock title was no easy task for the developers; I acknowledge that, but I cannot pretend I did not forget Comstock's voice and assertions as the story progressed. Unlike Rapture's idealiser, Columbia's had little imposing density in his character. But BioShock is not entirely about its self-righteous and paradoxical authority personalities, and Infinite shines outside this conceptual bubble. In spawning a more ancient, more morally delusional - and picturesque - society, the game becomes more satirical, thus more interesting to add to. A vivid city, Columbia exposes the illnesses of the American ""Thule"", so to speak. Over those clouds lurks a shadow of disguised hate and disciplined stupidity, much like the idealisation of national rights of John Gast's Columbia and the dangerous romanticising of the Manifest Destiny. Only this time, America went airborne, not westwards.Infinite triumphs on this premise. As it unfolds - so subtly -, its characters become less of casual citizens and more of monsters, just as its astonishing streets become filthy paths exposed by rebellious graffiti and mauled bodies. Its beautiful design and graphics provide the eye with constant awe, as though those bright windows and doorways far into the sky were veritable man-made stars. It is a joy to witness the game's visual ascension as you attempt Elizabeth's ""rescue"" and learn more about that floating pseudo-paradise.Oh, and speaking of Elizabeth. Although I expected more than an almost quintessential damsel in distress, voice acting and writing often gave me hope; and her background, fears and convictions throughout the story - not to mention her in-game functions, tacit but exciting as they are - forced me to think back to previous milestones of the story and look at the whole scenario from a standpoint which was not that of Booker DeWitt's. That was unique, I have got to say.BioShock Infinite may not cause as much thematic bewitchment or those dialogue goose pimples, but it offers decent food for thought; which is the safe haven of the series. Its virtue may not lie in character conception or in the renewal of the plasmid feature, for example, but its well-paced and extremely pleasurable gameplay, its audiovisual style, its sidekick system and its plotline premise hold consistency to the end of the chapter, refusing to even steer close to collapse. The BioShock name, though currently with a relatively uncertain future, still shines.			"

												BioShock Infinite is by no means a terrible game, but compared to its predecessor, it has many of the same flaws and lacks the redeeming poetry and vision.BioShock is now a modern classic. Its successor, BioShock Infinite, takes us to a new world that is superficially just as captivating as Rapture, but the similarities are purely superficial. Where BioShock had ideas, Infinite simply has plot devices. Where BioShock asked us to choose, Infinite just asks us to run and shoot.Part of what made BioShock special was that its ideas, emotions, story content, and gameplay were all coherent in a thematically consistent way. Ultimately BioShock told a story that was thematically compatible, and even thematically harmonious, with the conceits and conventions of FPS games. BioShock Infinite tries to tell a story, but the dissonance between the narrative/emotional content and the gameplay content is jarring in the new installment. It doesn't help that the story, though told with exquisite craft and care, ultimately is for all its artistry utterly inane.With a story that is so thoroughly undermined by the gameplay mechanics, Infinite needs to lean heavily on gameplay to be entertainment. Unfortunately, like BioShock, Infinite is merely a competent shooter from a gameplay perspective. Worse, the level designs are now more linear.In sum, it's a competent but underwhelming game, and outright disappointing when set against its predecessor.			"

												With Bioshock Infinite comes a game like you would never expect it these days !I just finished it and i was blowed away by this ending but i dont wanna spoiler anything.Take the gameplay from the first Bioshocks and make it a little bit better, give it more graphic (Atleast from the distance these graphics are SO damn good! See my screenshots) and throw in a fantastic story and let them develop it for 3 or more years and you get a game that deserves its 96 Metacritic score.To me one of the best games i played in my life and easily the best game of the year, if not of the decade (2010-2020).I cant understand why other games cant do this,  i can only come up with one reason for this, the Publishers ! The best example is EA... they destroyed Bioware, you can see this in looking at their old games and compare them to those new ones.Just stop buying games from such publishers and maybe they will return to let devs make good games such as this one again.I beat it in 15 hours on hard difficulty, tried to collect everything.And i highly recommend playing it on hard.Whatever, thanks Irrational Games for giving me this awesome experience with your game.

												Had loads of fun with this game. Everything is beautifully crafted, especially the set designs that come in a huge variety but all remain fresh and equally interesting. As with the original Bioshock, the intricate presentation of social themes and ideologies are an important part of the overarching design, and Bioshock Infinite is no different. They are gripping and clearly presented, while refraining from distracting the player from the main narrative. The story, while confusing and even overbearing at times, is intriguing, reaching a fascinating crescendo during the last 20 minutes of the game.The game is by no means 'perfect', but the clear amount of affection and care that has been put into every small detail in all of its many, many different components results in something that is thoroughly remarkable and enjoyable. It's a game that should be respected, and more importantly enjoyed, for a sum of all its parts.			"

												The only thing this game has going for it is it's beautiful graphics. The story is terrible in general and hard to follow especially if you're comparing it to its prequels. If you played the first two games, just skip this one. The gameplay mechanics are worst (the main example is that they introduce a stupid and mindless mechanic of ""press F to receive a reward from Elizabeth"", which interrupts all combat, and makes you invulnerable during the action so there is no strategy involved, just press F anytime the game tells you to and receive your reward) and interface for dealing with the vending machines is still not improved, the entire game is very linear and there are no choices to make.

												The story line in this game is good, but its not very clear unless you spend time actually trying to go along with it. The graphics are outstanding, the gameplay is fun but can be tricky at times. I will say its very overpriced for the amount of gameplay you get, 8 hours if you just casual play and get stuck at bits (my experience) and probably around 12 if you spend time trying to do extras.

												5/10While fun was had, the game was mediocre overall. Just because I had fun doesn't mean others should look for it in a dissappointing game.Pros:-Artistic Direction was great.-Sound/VA very well done.-Skyrails make fights more interesting than previous bioshocks.Cons:-Story was convoluted and generally bad. It doesn't explore the difficult situations that it presents, and roughly halfway through the game the plot dissappears due to multiverse theory. The ending only exacerbates the muddy storytelling.-The choices made in game were pointless.-Voxophones were nowhere near as interesting as audio diaries or audio logs.-Characterization of Comstock, Fink, Fitzroy, Slate, etc. just fall flat compared to Ryan, Fontaine, Cohen, Steinman, or even Delacroix, Polito, Shodan, and Xerxes.-While we're on the subject Elizabeth was not very well done either.-Corridor shooter.-Not enough Skyrails, and conceptually they make no sense.-2 gun limit.-Shields for no reason.-Vigors overly similar in terms of utility.-No hacking or Research Camera.-Enemies lack variety.-Difficulty was implemented poorly, giving enemies more health just makes playing tedious.

												Jack of all trades, master of none.Bioshock infinite is a shooter based on the existing franchise, however the gameplay felt poorly planned.  The firefights were uninspired bouts of you against massive bullet sponges.  There is little incentive to use your elemental powers as the enemies are easily defeated without.  The combat seems to encourage the use of cover, however it lacks a key component: usable cover.  Each fight is approached the same way, and although the game lets you use your powers to place traps, you will almost never find yourself in a place to use them.  Each fight is a head-on bout of how many bullets of your seemingly infinite supply it will take to progress in the story.speaking of the story, it has no focus.  In the beginning, it is a portrayal of a society in the clouds full of religious bigotry and racism.  It soon turns into a completely pointless display of how much Ken Levine knows about theoretical physics, apparently just enough to think he knows what he's doing when he has really only scratched the surface.  Although at times interesting, by the end it does not make sense with itself and still baffles the community and even Levine himself.  The story will leave you feeling empty, as it makes no remark on the social injustice happening in columbia.The game tries to do too many stories and fails to complete them effectively, making the whole game feel both unguided and lazily put together.  If there was a more clear direction as to where they wanted to go with the story, it would have been at least redeemable in that aspect.  The gameplay should be completely revamped, as the actual first-person-shooter aspect is neither fun nor rewarding.  Every weapon uninspired, every special ability almost pointless to use.Bioshock: Infinite gets a 2/5			"

												This is my fave Bioshock game,  better characters that I actually felt like I cared about,  I like that the characters talk to each other and have banter, previous games only chatter you'd get is from audio logs or a radio message telling you what to do next, environment is visually gorgeous and has an immersive if somewhat convoluted story.I like Columbia much more than I do Rapture,  swinging around on sky hooks and using a sky hook to swoop down and kill an enemy. I was starting to get sick of Rapture and am glad this game has a different setting.The game gives the illusion of a vast expansive sky city, it does not have the stuffy claustrophobic feel of the underwater city Rapture. In Columbia you just want to soar and swoop at every chance you can. Though it does make my stomach churn at times using a sky rail is almost like riding a roller coaster.Elizabeth is an interesting character though at first she reminded me a lot of a Disney princess, the way she moves, expressions in an over exagerated disney princess way, she's almost a rip off of Belle from Beauty and the Beast in how she looks, she has same hairstyle, big over large eyes.You have a variety of ways to kill enemies you can ask elizabeth to open a tear so you can have more cover, a hook for swinging off, medical kits, guns, turrets, though that is limited as you can only have 1 tear open and active at a time.But the game is not without frustration.You can only carry 2 guns at a time which is very limiting, though you can swap 1 gun you are carrying for a gun that's on the ground, you can never carry more than 2 at a time.Vigors are often the most fun and versatile ways to kill which are the replacement for plasmids but are much more limited in their use as you can't carry salts on you, you seem to run out of salts way too quickly though  (salts are the blue energy metre simular to eve) to replenish salts you have to find some sort of drink or a bottle of salts. Usually there are salts nearby or Elizabeth will find and toss you some.You can't carry first aid kits either but you have a energy shield which is better, you don't lose health unless your shield is fully depleted and if that happens you can just hide till it replenishes.But even so I found the battles more fast paced and enjoyable than the previous Bioshocks.I dislike most  that there is only auto save and you can't save your game when you want. I wanted to stop playing but it said my last auto save was 10 minutes ago, so had to keep playing for 10 more minutes to get the next checkpoint. It makes it so I have to replay again if I just want to quit playing. The most annoying thing about the game. I had to leave the game running when I wanted a break as my last checkpoint save was half an hour ago, auto saves should be at least every 10 minutes.There is no hacking, I miss that.The only thing that is a tiny bit like it is that Elizabeth can pick locks for you, but there is no mini game associated with it.To sumarise it overall the game is better in some ways than the other Bioshocks but also worse in other aspects.The story overall is rather freaky, tragic and messes with your head, I did a lot of reading about it to understand the story fully. But I better not say anything else as I don't want to spoil it for those who have not played and completed the game.Mostly though it feels enjoyable, fun, scary in some ways and exciting. Though unlike others I would not got so far as to say it's one of the best games I've played. Almost would rate it an 8, but there is too many negatives that the game should not have, it does not deserve more than 7/10.			"

												This game was really disappointing. The story was fine and surprising. However the gameplay was going strictly for FPS fun but did not deliver. It was dull, the guns have no heft and even upgrading them did give them extra oomph. It doesn't help that I am not that creative with my powers but still I did not care for the final battle. I thought the songbird would have branched ending but it looks like it made no difference. Oh well, I can see why people said it sucked. Try it out if you never played any of the Bioshock games and then play the first one to get something really cool. 2/5			"

												""Are you a bad man?"" ""I am a bad man"" ""No you're not a bad man."" *Killing about twenty people* ""Are you a bad man?"" ""That guy is a bad man."" ""That guy is a bad man.""Bioshock Infinite wants to be a game about the nature of ""what-if"" and choice, framed in a story about ex-military officer Booker DeWitt sent to a mystical city in the clouds to rescue the mysterious waif Elizabeth, whose strange world-altering powers and sheltered childhood lends itself to an unfolding narrative of mutual cooperation; encouraging the player to care for an NPC as the two of you battle an unjust world out to get you.What it *is*, is a game about shooting dudes in the face. Lots of them, in hectic combat where you tend to get disoriented a lot and your low health and lack of carriable healing items causes you to run around from cover to cover like a headless chicken looking for that precious popcorn or abandoned soda to boost your all-too-fragile health. And when the red mist is over you are left with a pile of dead police officers and ordinary, well-intentioned people convinced you are a bad guy. Which, after having killed about twenty of them, you kind of sort of feel like. Racists they may be, but nothing in-game ever convinced me these people *needed* to die, and especially not in such crude, gore-tastic manners.Bioshock Infinite has a real issue with story-and-gameplay integration: The story and presentation leaves me ill-motivated to care about the main characters or anything they do. The gameplay, even if it had been better (it is certainly the weakest of the Bioshock games to date, sacrificing the last vestiges of System Shock on the altar of Call of Duty) creates a sharp divide between the themes of caring for someone and cooperating with them and killing endless hordes of very human cannon fodder with nary a thought; apparently only the hopes and dreams of the main character are worth diving into. Booker's dismissing of practically everything about this magical cloud wonderland he finds himself in, or his refusal to engage in any form of self-reflection about himself or his actions, certainly don't help matters.In fact, if I may be so bold I might say this game's core excellence is as a showpiece for the ideas promoted by Spec Ops: The Line. Do I feel like a hero yet? No, Bioshock Infinite. No, I do not.			"

												BioShock Infinite has lofty ambitions. It tries to tackle some social and existential questions, provide entertaining gameplay, and wrap it all up in an emotionally moving package. Unfortunately, the game's polish belies its shallow depth.The gunplay brings absolutely nothing new to the table. While the addition of Sky-Lines was an interesting idea, the implementation reduces it mostly to a form of locomotion, rather than a primary form of combat. The game provides challenge through tough, not intelligent enemies, especially on later difficulties where several headshots may be necessary for a simple grunt.As for the story, it attempts to bring in elements of multiverse theory and explores ideas of choice and consequence for each of the characters in the game. However, in doing so, it contradicts itself several times over in its conclusion. I won't spoil that here; there are several videos you can watch to see the ending, along with interpretations if you wish.While the game paints a pretty picture and plays a few nice tunes, it fails to sufficiently answer many of the questions the early portions will give you. What one is left with, then, is contradictions and loose threads, and the game provides very little to alleviate these issues.			"

												To quote someone else, Bioshock Infinite is wasted potential. The art deco, like Bioshock, is amazing. But, just like Bioshock again, any topics they bring up like racism for example has no commentary or explanation for it which is just bad. This is because it makes the setting and characters feel shallow, and because commentary and explanation can be interesting and informative in it's own right. The interactions between Booker and Elizabeth are interesting and will probably keep you engage enough to see the story to the end, but most of the game is bad shoot people gameplay. People will argue that the gameplay is bad because B:I got rid of basically all the RPG elements in Bioshock and also made the map design completely linear, but I disagree with this. These people don't remember that Bioshock already had shallow RPG mechanics and poor map design. The maps were design so that each path was a deadend that the player had to backtrack through once a mission was done... instead of making things loop around. This happens in B:I still, but the linearity negates most of it to optional missions. In B:I the vigors (plasmids) nearly all do the same thing (LMB to attack, RMB to make a trap) removing any strategy on which one to choose and removing any reason to mix them together (which atleast Bioshock had). You also can only hold 2 weapons, which ruins any chance of mixing up the gameplay. Like you have limited resources so you have to choose wisely on what weapons to upgrade so you'll probably only hold the same 2 weapons you've upgraded through the game because if you upgraded a 3rd weapon you won't be able to use it unless you randomly find it on the ground in the middle of the fight. Also since you don't have an inventory Elizabeth will randomly throw you items that you need during a fight which means there isn't really any strategy to refilling your health/magic in the middle of combat. Yes there are items that have small refilling benefits but that doesn't replace potions. You also can buy refill potions that are applied instantly and also random refill areas in combat arenas so just abuse these locations?But while they basically stripped down the gameplay to a bare FPS minimum, I think it was a step in the right direction for these developers. But they needed to go one step further, remove the gameplay entirely. Seriously, if this was a Themepark Simulator there would have been more time to flesh out the narrative, characters, and setting which the game greatly needed.I played the game on medium and I would not recommend playing it on higher difficulties because there are bullet sponge enemies and the only boss fight in the game is a bullet sponge that infinitely spawns enemies in which you fight the boss multiple times. I can't recommend this game because of the poor gameplay. I would recommend instead watching an LP (Let's Play or Long Play depending on your perspective c;) and buying some cool looking merchandise from Irrational Games instead https://store.irrationalgames.com/ "

												Bioshock is what I hope HL:Episode 3 would be like, except it has magic. Well, it doesn't call it magic, but it's the same idea. You're a private investigator who can't investigate for♥♥♥♥♥♥and gets pulled along by the undertow of fate and personalities in the universe. And that's just fine. You can switch between two kinetic weapons out of quite a few in the game ranging from pistols to RPGs. Some are better than others, and at one point the overvariety of similar weapons gets a bit overbearing. You also have the power of 'vigors' (spells). I find these similar to the weapons in that there are some stand-outs that I love using but many fall into the ""me-too"" category, particularly those that are only obtained late in the game. The very first vigor, possession, is by far the most useful and fun in general combat situations. There is also a grusome (if fun) melee attack that tends to become obsolete early due to the prevelence of guns unless you find the right gear to improve it when more difficult enemies appear.The most similar aspect to the HL2 series is your companion, Elizabeth, who assists you for much of the game. Unlike Alyx in the aformentioned series, Elizabeth doesn't engage in (and outshine you at) combat. Instead she will throw items to the player and effectively act as an engineer by pulling turrents and other defensive items out of her tear. Oh, tears... those are ""rips in dimensional time and space, revealing an alternate universe, which does not exist in the current world."" Don't worry, it makes sense in context. While Elizabeth's role could be otherwise filled, she is useful in combat and does not require guarding, a good choice by the devs. She's a compelling character that is the real star of the story, not the player controlled 'Booker."" And the story is quite good, though it's confusing at times and feels like it has a few aborted endings. Most of the time it's compelling, though, and makes you want to keep playing to find out what's going on through the time loops and dimensional warps that occur. The ending is a powerful gut punch, and not wishy-washy at all. There are some choices in the game, but none matter. Or perhaps they all matter, but none can alter the ending- further explanation would be spoilerish and get into the philosophy of determinism. There are plot holes, as with any story that involves some sort of time/space warp, but it's a good story with a puncuated ending that I needed to sit back and recover from afterwards.  Then I quickly restarted so I could get back to the more carefree portions of the game and also start to see the events from the hindsight of knowing how everything plays out. There's a lot of backstory lying unobtrusively around for those who want to look for it in a playthrough.Cons include an awful save system (this is 2015, why can't we figure this out?) and a couple of portions of the game that are too repetitive with no payoff.I'd say the game is a steal at sale prices under $30.I didn't play the first bioshock but I think it might be a good time to pick it up...

												There's a cool storyline but it gives itself away far too soon.  And the game is very pretty but you are on rails most of the time so the levels often feel plastic and static (like a Doom level but with modern smoke and flare effects).  So, you are left with obviously demarked shooting areas and then a cutscene --  rinse, repeat.  The shooting is frenetic but not very strategic.   You can swap out your abilities at any time which sounds like fun but it quickly becomes apparent that the differing abilities often amount to the exact same thing.  It is far too easy to hide and shoot thru every dang level.  As a point of reference and as shooters go?   I would still play the first Far Cry over this game.      In that old game, fighting was strategic and varied and the large levels offered tactical choices.    Bottomline -- ""Infinite"" is sadly a C+ game with an A- story.			"

												A remarkable story that puts the Bioshock franchise in a place where anything can happen next and everything from the series were placed together.Deep and engaging characters, astonishing visuals and a truly rich backstory fulfilled with a mixture of history and fantasy, covering aspects of our society like the struggle of social classes or religion and state exploit, make one of the best games of all time.Bugs at the beginning, some boring mechanics, unjustified excessive violence, bad design/budget decisions, the well known millions of chain quests covering the same places over and over, and mostly the unbelievable absence of a decent save system almost ruin the game or make it average, but the good points are just awesome and hold Bioshock Infinite like an awesome, over the top game.It's a good mix of action and story - entertainment and art excellence.(some technical mess, but it's all right)____________________________________________PS For those who needs the subtitle help in a foreign language:You may get lost at the end of the story, because it's deep and explained too fast. Play it again or simply search for the story explained via web to help you understand it if needed.			"

												This is the most overrated game that I know of. You walk around, from what is basically arena to arena, shooting bullet spongey enemies. The game only allows you to carry two guns at once, meaning combat is very boring, and spend most of your looking around for ammo. The vigors are very boring, mostly just push/pull enemies, or attack/ set mines. The story is passable, but it really bashes you over the head with 'racism is bad', and is made convoluted with to much fighting in an effort to try and make the game longer. The graphics are quite nice, and it's a good pc port, but this does not make up for the absolutly terrible combat.			"

												After months of trying to stop myself from playing the game, I have finally beaten (after getting it from the sale) the game in 2 days. The result is that I am not one of of hte many fans of the game. Now, please ignore this review if you are a fan of bioshock, this may indeed anger you.Ok. First off, I want to say that yes this game has a great story. the story is simple but is a well done story that has some scifi elements that made me say, I want to see a bit more. The ending is really good as it deals with a twist that was kinda unseen in the game. The characters, though likeable, I would say a bit forgetable. The characters I think are more memorable is the twins, who are pretty funny because they have a bit of the ""out of this world"" characteristic that you can enjoy. Elizabeth, the main female protagonist does indeed seems to be a very like able character, though not exactly a outstanding character as people would make her to be. However, the biggest problem with the game is the game, which I'm sorry to say, is subpar. Originally, I though that the original game wasn't that interesting to me because the combat system was too easy and too dull for me to continue playing the game. In Bioshock Infinite, I felt that combat felt less impressive than the first game. Fewer weapons and limits to what weapons you can have often drives me nuts when playing games. It even worst that the guns feel less impactful and that combat also felt like a chore for me. The only weapons that felt good to use were the pistols, revolver and the Air Grabber.The special abilities that you collect are also a real dull choice as it's possible to only use 1 or 2 of them throughout the game without even using others more than one moment. The enemies in the game are also a real annoyance, Some enemies, such as the RPG and Handy man, felt really overpowered and that the hints given about the handy man's weak point do not even result in doing any damage. The Ghost level is what I considered the worst level becauuse of how poorly done it is and how even the objective pointer after the 2nd tear was extremely broken because they only lead you aroudn the whole map.Overall, despite the great story, I cannot say this game is considerd a 9s or even the 10s that it recieved. I wasnt' surprised to see this game get awards at all. Overall, this game isnt' not the game we need or want.			"

												Brilliant presentation, mediocre gameplay, badly written storyline.All style and no substance. The story consists of plot twists for no reason other than to have plot twists, regardless of the mess it makes of the narrative, or what messages it ends up conveying. One character has the special ability to literally tear holes in the plot. As the ""alternate universes"" angle comes in, any reason to care about the characters goes out the window - if they're all alternate versions, with alternate realities, why care about any of them? Why is one reality/timeline objectively better, or more valid, than any other? On top of that, the gameplay is frankly boring. It does absolutely nothing to advance the shooter genre - on the contrary it's bland and derivative. It is VERY pretty though, I'll give it that.------SPOILERS BELOW------When I say ""The story consists of plot twists for no reason other than to have plot twists, regardless of the mess it makes of the narrative, or what messages it ends up conveying"" I'm referring to the Vox Populi turning on you.The game starts out with the premise that you're fighting against some really awful people, really vile racists and bigots. By introducing the plot twist that you must now fight the Vox Pop, though the developers almost certainly did not intend it, what their game is now saying is ""You know who the REAL evil people are? They're not really the oppressors, they're the downtrodden minorities!"" It's an absurd position to take, and it's an absurd situation to be in. There is no justification for having to fight the people you've been fighting to save, other than it being a hackneyed ""shocking"" plot twist just for the sake of having a plot twist.You can tell that at least one person at 2K had an inkling that this might be the case because before you have to fight them the Vox Pop are mostly black folks, but you only ever fight Irish folks. You can tell because it would make the offensive absurdity of the situation starkly obvious if the second half of the game was all about massacring black people!""♥♥♥♥ minorities, up with Whitey"" obviously wasn't what 2K had in mind when they set out to make this game. But because whoever wrote the plot didn't stop and think that is what their creation says.Then there's simple, silly things it does to the plot. We jump through a portal into an alternate universe after failing to save the weapons dealer. Ok, so how does it help anything at all to defeat Comstock in this new universe? We've still left behind a universe where he wins. Why is this new universe objectively any different?Why does Booker ultimately drowning himself change anything at all? He's just ONE iteration of Booker; why does the death of that universe's Booker have any impact on any others?			"

												Despite this game receiving a majority of popular feedback, I find it falls very short as a game. I do however feel that it is a fantastic piece of art. The environments are gorgeous, and exploring Colombia were rather enjoyable. Also the story was well told and quite moving despite some gaps in continuity. However that's the extent of its positive qualities.As game it fails to be challenging, even on Hard mode the combat is incredibly trivial. Elizabeth can keep you feed with an infinite supply of ammo, health, and salts, which you don't even need because you can just kill everything with the skyhook. Aside from the combat the game was incredibly linear, with very few secrets, and of those that did exist none really provided any substantial benefit because the combat was so easy to begin with.And again back to the problems with it being so linear, I can't help but compare it to the first Bioshock, which was also linear, however at least had multiple endings. With Bioshock: Infinite there is one ending, and honestly it's not that good. For a game that has a theme of infinite worlds with infinite possibilities you have only one ending? Really?To sum it all up it's just not a good game; like I said the story was pretty good, but the combat is poor, and the player cannot change the outcome of the ending. In terms of gameplay it's more like Myst or Riven than a shooter. It's just a beautiful enviornment to explore. However, unlike Myst or Riven, Bioshock: Infinate is devoid of any choice or challenge. Overall I'd have to say that you would probably be better off just watching all the cutscenes on youtube, because it would make a better movie than a game.			"

Its a discussion about history and politics written by someone who took a 100 level college class and likes to argue at parties. It's an -interesting- world but none of it makes any sense no matter how you try to suspend your disbelief.It's not an awful game, the production is AAA quality as one would expect. It's just shallow and soulless beyond its beautiful facade. I keep asking myself, ""Why are these people shooting at me?"" and I literally never have an asnwer. Furthermore the system to direct you tothe nect objective will literally run you in a never ending circle and provide you aboslutely no direction as to how to proceed in the game.Why are these people shooting at me? Where am I supposed to go? Why is plot consistancy so hard? Why can't anyone make a twist ending in a videogame that actually makes any sense without ignoring absolutely everything that happened in the entire game?			"

												After letting this game stew for a while, I find my opinion has worsened from even my lackluster feelings after beating the game. Before you begin in with cries of you don't get it or you can't compare it to bioshock, I will bisect those two arguments right here and now. First off, yes, I may have missed bits of the subtext but I understood what was going on and it was a bit of a mess. Being pretentious does not mean being misunderstood, it means pretending to be making points and being smarter than you are, and this game is not nearly as intelligent or interwoven as it would like you to think it is. Secondly, yes I can compare it to bioshock because its called bioshock infinite, has psuedo-plasmids and similar combat and even blanketly steals sound assets from the first. The very name invited the comparison and therefore invites criticism regarding that. Now with that out of the  way, no I would not reccomend this game at full price, though at a sale price I can reccomend it for a playthrough at least. The game squanders its potential by not focusing on the more interesting bits, like talking to citizens and exploring the town with dull combat, that is infinitely more boring than Bioshock. Theres no real sense of progression, the fights are just long and drawn out and the abilities are mostly uninterestinhg or just copies of the original games plasmids. And speaking on that, the vigors are just reskinnned plasmids, just without any of the lore, intrigue or even real relation to the universe that Bioshock and even a game that I consider in some ways to be better, Bioshock 2 had. Theres no interwoven lore, the world is just there, the physics♥♥♥♥♥♥is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t pretentious and the main villian and city are uninteresting. I don't like how no one took this game to task for its issues, because maybe I am being pretty critical but the game is not as perfect as advertised. It got talked up and talked up and talked up, and even when I tempered exprectations I was left dissapointed. Its infinitely weaker than Bioshock, lorewise and world building wise and I just don't like it. I also really don't like how a game that did everything better than this one was overshadowed by this one because it was so hyped and deep and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Its not that deep, and when you have a line like ""The city doesn't float cause of the ballons, it floats cause physics!!!"" you know its trying to be that game without understanding that by trying and not doing it falls flat. Worth a playthrough, but bewared the hype, as I personally felt it was far weaker than advertised. Go play  the much better Bioshock, or even Bioshock 2, or hell, go play Spec ops if you want to play a truly great game, and if you want to see what this game could've been, go play the game it helped push away from the perhiphery, Metro Last light, because that game for all its flaws is much better than this one.

												This game is literally driving me crazy! I can't stop thinking about it. Somebody might say that an average man thinks about sex every 7 second. Well I think about this game every damn seven seconds! It's just that GOOD! Only if I could remove my memory to experience it all over again... I've been seriously depressed lately because of this.I think I made it very clear that this game is worth playing. I loved every second of it and it did make me very confused sometimes, but I did figure it all out eventually. This game has the best story in a videogame I have ever seen, and the athmosphere of Columbia is just perfect. Characters are near perfection, especially Elizabeth. The gameplay is... good. It's not bad, not at all, but usually I just want to quickly shoot my way trough enemies just to start scavenging around and progressing into the story. Just as I said, the story is somewhat confusing to wrap around your head, but you'll figure it out. The dlc:s are also worth playing. I could almost say that I enjoyed burial at sea even more than the main game. I won't spoil anything, but the ending made me cry like a little ♥♥♥♥♥. OVERALL THIS GAME IS WORTH EVERY CENT AND IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY THIS DO GET THE SEASON PASS AND PLAY TROUGH BIOSHOCK 1 BEFORE BURIAL AT SEA JUST TO GET THE FULL EXPERIENCE!			"

												A very very beautiful game. You do not need a amazing computer, but one that is playable with alot of res, and graphics. All the work put into this game is amazing. All the graphics are amazing even the small tiny things. At the start of the game when you get up in the clouds in Columbia. Take adventage of it. Take screenshots of everything. Bands, Shops and especially elizabthes tower. I think what made me love the game so much, was the era it is set in. It looks like it was set in the early 19th century 1910 or 1920's perhaps?, that may not be correct but i really love how it is set. I think the most beautiful part of the game is at the start when you go to Columbia .Overall i recommend this game to everyone and i rate it 10 out of 10			"

												An incredible mix of atmosphere and setting that are marred by awful FOV and gameplay, Bioshock Infinite was a huge disappointment.If you liked the first Bioshock, this is a lot more of that same combat, just without any of teh challenge. Finding anything in the enviroment is impossible, as your FOV is so small you have to scan for an hour to get that one Voxophone you want. Guns are floaty and the powers are all the same mix of ""Damage, damage, oh and the same disable you already have, but CROWS NOW!"". Stuck with it because the story was interesting, but even that was ruined by a terrible ending. Wouldn't reccomend this game to anyone that didn't love the combat of the first game.			"

												Game started out fantastic. Beautiful design, engaging themes, and entertaining situations. Fast forward to around the sixth hour of gameplay: redundant fights, annoying combat, unsatisfying powers, and (if playing on the highest difficulty) maddeningly frustrating fights with the Handyman. Seriously, if you disagree with me, try to beat the Handyman in one of the last fights on the hardest difficulty. There is nothing gratifying with the combat structure in this game.Most reviews that I see gush over the game's story. Look, I get it: the idea of alternate universes, travel between them, and consequences of choices that can alter future choices is intriguing. Unfortunately, getting to these themes involved introducing multiple, underdeveloped characters that just seemed like more and more names being thrown at you. The games storyline with the revolution and the overall ""alternate universes"" theme conflicted and annoyed me for the latter part of the game. Fighting animated patriot machines was... dumb. It seemed like the developers felt they could get away with putting any stupid scenario in the game just because in one of the infinite universes it was possible.I would recommend many other games over Bioshock Infinite. I strongly feel that its success is a product of strong advertising. Not GOTY in terms of atmosphere, story, and combat mechanics.			"

												Bioshock Infinite started out a great and incredibly beautiful, but after many hours it started dragging out for far too long. Combat turned from fun to an empty, churny and uninspired chore between story nibblets. It felt like the team lost track of ""fun"" 70% or so into the game. As such, the promise the game made with its fantastic first hours turned out to be a huge lie towards the end. The many many faults with the nimble-as-a-refridgerator controls were at first totally forgivable, but when everything but the visuals crumbled and came tumbling down around it, the painful dance with those blaring faults were pretty much all that was left. The payoff the game convinced me it could deliver was just reduced to a dirty rag tossed to the side.Playing on hard can be a real challenge towards the end, but I find that most of my deaths through the game came from getting stuck in basic geometry, the character not running, or simply not jumping to the various hook-spots when he was supposed to. Bioshock Infinite is also a perfect reminder of why enemies using hit-scan weapons in shooters just aren't fun.I will try to beat it as I'm most probably just one small hill from the end, just to get it over with, and certainly not because I find it entertaining anymore. I'm actually even rather uninterested by the story at this point, as all the characters decided to just muddle up their believability with just stupid and inconsistent behavior.It honestly feels like the original team of the game were not, at all, the same people who made the latter hours of it. Weird. Disappointing.I really wanted to recommend this. I was looking forward to finishing it so I could look up the DLC. I had it in my list of favorites. But I can't recommend it anymore. And I will certainly not touch the DLC. "

												I'm a Bioshock fan and I've been looking forward to play this... I finally got my hands on it but just didn't want to believe what I've seen...Two weapon limit and combat mechanics just feel wrong. Enemies are way too precise and feel non-human. Combat feels rushed and hectic. Enemy dialogs are repeatative and annoying. Resources are too tight which makes the scavenge around most of the time instead of focusing on the atmosphere. Elizabeth does help you with ammunition however it does become annoying when she interrupts the combat to throw coins and salts and ammo at you...graphics are good... however if you want to explore Columbia more you'll have invisible boundaries blocking you.So far [after 9 hours] story is also really predictable. Also the NPCs around you almost don't respond to you at all. They all look and act like bunch of robots...To sum up after the first two Bioshock games this game is a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. I just don't understand how this game attracts more attention and better reviews than first two. Save your money for some other game...EDIT:I've just played it through, I must admit that the story did get better than at the beginning (very good ending), however I still find the first two games of the franchise better. Weapons and plasmids were much more fun to use. Combat felt right and fair. And the storytelling was better than in Bioshock Infinite. Instead of a weak start and a good end they were consistently good. It's sad to see one of my favourite games becoming something so dull...			"

												This game felt like one of those ""great"" films everyone says is amazing but while experiencing it I atleast didn't really feel it. The visuals are very nice, the voice acting top notch and the atmosphere is interesting, which is normally enough for me, but for whatever reason, it wasn't enough. I found the combat/gameplay tedious, with a few moments of fun, and the story elements are so convoluted it is difficult to admire as a whole, but yes there are some very nice ""moments."" Like those great films I may look back on it and see its brilliance but with the over reliance on long combat sequences and optional side information I doubt I will find the time. Would perhaps be better suited as a film, as the story is so linear and the gameplay not that interesting.			"

Do you remember when you carried a whole arsenal and you combined them with the plasmids? Well... forget it! You carry only 2 weapons. The Hack has gone! The Selling Machines for me were worthless too.In the half of the game I was saying to myself: keep playing, just finish the game, you paid it, just finish it! Every mission I had, I was rushing to finish it because I didn't wanted to play this game anymore!The end was♥♥♥♥♥♥.. and the whole storyline!Generally, this game is a big letdown!

												I can't recommend this game -Don't get me wrong, the art style and story are great, the gameplay is challenging and the game is fun, overall.If you can play it for more than 5 minutes at a time.  I wish I'd done some research before buying, but Google search results and Steam's support forum don't lie - there's a world of hurt awaiting a lot of random people that try to play this game, primarily in the form of direct to desktop crashes after random periods of time in-game.I'm no newb to troubleshooting hardware, drivers and software issues, but nothing has worked for me, although your mileage may vary.  2K Games is basically ignoring anyone that reports this issue, unfortunately.  It's really a shame, because the game makes me want to finish it, but I can't stand replaying the same parts over and over, hoping to hit a save checkpoint before the next crash.  So, long story short, it's buggy and basically unplayable for me.  It might work just fine for you, but if I'd known so many people were having issues with it, I'd have spent my money elsewhere.			"

												Being a huge fan of BioShock 1 and 2, I was excited about this game coming out. For months I avoided everything the /r/gaming ♥♥♥♥♥ had to say about it, avoided spoilers, avoided gameplay videos. Anything to just not spoil what I assumed would be the story behind the awesomeness that was the first two games.I was wrong. So very wrong. This game is terrible. It's a bigger piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥than Assassin's Creed 3. The entire game is comprised of the dev team sucking each other's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥for 6-12 hours while moaning ""mmmmm fatalism nnnngggggggg"" over and over. The combat is garbage - you can overpower everything easily without having to worry about things like needing to find all the weapons. The plasmids are pointless. Other than the game forcing you to use some of them to advance the storyline, you can just pick the one you like best and annihilate everything. Or you know, abuse the Tears to just cheese turrets and the like. They respawn, so if yours dies, just hop up on the sky rail and wait it out, then re-Tear them. Or do like I do in all games - walk the ♥♥♥♥ up to mobs, beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them melee style, and laugh as you plunder the soggy remains of their bodies for cash and food. Let's talk about food for a minute. It's everywhere in this city. People just carry tons of it in their pockets. One guy had a pineapple in his pocket. Seriously. A pineapple. Could you tell from looking at him that he was sporting such an epic bulge? No. And it's not like he had some unique brand of pants that enabled him to stuff a whole pineapple in there - they were the same pants everyone else had. Good news for guys hung like a moose, and good news for guys who don't believe in carrying grocery bags.The gameworld is pretty, as long as you don't look at things like the very flat grass and plant life. There's a lot of detail to things - cigarette butts around the trash bins, books with fine detail, and some very questionable artwork, which brings me to my next point.The entire game is a very long and drawn out story about how the white man is superior, and you should persecute non-whites, as well as the Jews. And why would you do this? Because you're super religious and that's what your prophet wants of you. A fair amount of blatant and subtle racism takes place, and the story expects you to just roll with it. The whole thing was more of a cheap addition of ""lolz look racism mmmm fatalism"" instead of making people look at moral or ethical decisions.Early on the game they even present that to you - you make the moral and ethical choice of choosing Elizabeth's broach - a  free bird or a cage. I chose cage, because ♥♥♥♥ that constipated ♥♥♥♥♥. As I played along with someone who chose the bird, I noticed that the game is identical. No matter which path you chose, it ends at the same conclusion and they wrap it up with ""well that's just how it is, everything is decided for you"" and circle jerk it a bit harder. Normally I would add a spoiler warning, but I'm not in this case, because I want to prevent other people from wasting their time and money on this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Elizabeth is your daughter, and you end up dead. Oh and it was also multiple realities, so she's not dead, and you're not dead. It then implies that BioShock 1 and 2 are also alternate realities. At this point I was so annoyed by the level of terrible going on that I let the credits roll in case it was a joke. When I realized it wasn't a joke, I uninstalled the game. Since then I have reinstalled it to play the Season Pass that was thankfully $5 during the Steam sale, thinking it would finally give me the great content I wanted. (I am told that the multiplayer for BioShock 2 is actually the game I was expecting, so we'll see)Nope. You start out exactly how I pictured the game - in Rapture, it's gritty, gorgeous, and how the damn thing should have been. Then Elizabeth leads you on a 45 minute circle jerk about fatalism and alternate realities. You meet the Little Sisters as they first form, which is cool, and then you're trying to rescue one. You fight a Big Daddy, which is a joke - just cheese the Tears and you win. Then you see the rest of your flashbacks, which are the other realities, and then Elizabeth kills you with the help of a Big Daddy because you're an evil man in another reality. In summary: the people who made this game took a massive religious♥♥♥♥♥♥ then wiped their collective asses with the BioShock name and called it a game. Don't buy it. Just don't. Take the money and stuff it in a stripper's thong. Or buy something else, like Super Meat Boy. Or Recettear. Or $30 worth of chicken nuggets. All of these things are far more valuable than this♥♥♥♥♥♥show. "

So many broken livesThis game has the most beatiful graphics, outstanding detailed universe along with most terrifying and disgusting story.Game plot defines 'shock' part of its name - the shocking story of human vices, multiplied by infinity.I wish game was more 'open world', so I could discover more of secret corners and got deeper into people of Columbia lives.I wish it has more options to chose from at every moment, so I don't always have to slaughter inhabitants and cause that many deaths indirectly.But all that would make playthrough even longer and mentally staying in Columbia was not pleasant sojourn the deeper I got into its history.Techically, game is a masterpiece - graphics, level design, enemies AI, user interface - every part of gameplay is amazingly good. As for story, it is something everyone should try to go through and see how long could it take to fix single hasty careless action (won't you agree it is not typical for games?). So, yeah, game is matchless.More kills per minute and more screnshots made than I could predict.PS: even though I was trying to thoroughly learn storyline during walkthrough, I was either too dumb or inattentive to understand the story and had to read wiki to make things clear. So, bear in mind the story is bigger than the main game and maybe even bigger than that DLCs hold.			"

												Most people seem to praise this game for it's story. However, the story itself is unfocused, doesn't push any limits, and uses the timeframe poorly. The parts about quantum physics also make little sense and seem to written by somebody who has no understanding of the science behind it.Gameplay is abysmal. There's no exploration like there was in Bioshock 1. The gunplay is cut and pasted straight from the Call of Duty games, two weapon limit and all. Most the vigors work as stuns so you'll probably only be using one.The only positives I can say it the sound effects are nice, the graphics are pretty at times, and the earlier parts have a cool atmosphere. This game is really only worth 5 bucks though.			"

												Bioshock Infinite, also known as Run Forward While Shooting, Ayn Rand edition.Most game play actually did not consist of Running Forward While Shooting, but rather it was more boring as I stood perfectly still lining up incredibly boring headshots on AI that would generally stand pefectly still.Now, I am not a 'hardcore' game player by any respect. I enjoy my shooters arena like and my plots sufficient in narrative capacities. I don't want to devote hours to learning Meta outside of a game. But when a game has AI that cannot even be arsed to move and shoot competently, I can't even handle how completely bored I am.Definitely an excellent example of why not to buy games from EA.			"

												I bought this when it came out for 360 because I was a huge BioShock fan. Mistake.This game is NOT bad, it is a downright overhyped dissapointment. It looks great and works generally fine, there is no amazing soundtrack (not that big a deal), but where it falls short is the content.GAMEPLAY: Gameplay is horribly repetitive. The false sense of open space is actually more confining than the actual confined space found in the first two games. Gameplay consists of pathetic ""vigors"" that have no taste and all have trap versions. The guns are underpowered generally, don't seem cool, and the removal of the weapon wheel is a bust as ammo is no longer conserved. The sky-hook is insanely broken. What could have been the selling point of the game (and kinda was) was boring, repetitive, and screwed up your objective beacon. The Elizabeth tears were alright but anoyying and the constant backtracking was a strain.ENVIRONMENT: The environment is dirt. At first, the environment is cool; walking around a steampunk 1900s racist city and all, seeing the magical tech at work. As soon as the tears start happening and you start running around, you realize how boring it all is. The game doesn't feel like a fight for survival and freedom on a floating city - it feels like MMO quests in first-person on a bunch of blimps. The best level when a ""scare""-factor is actually involved comes too few and too late.STORY: The story is linear and bland. The main story is fairly guessable and not fleshed out. Voxophones, which are like the audiorecorders of old Bioshock, offer little and are too hard to get too. The DLC storylines are too blatant in their fit to the paradoxy of Infinite, getting those weak fools who enjoy this game to drool over the worst dialogue ever.CONCLUSION: A total buchery of one of the best games I've ever played. Removes all the good elements of bioshock 1 & 2, has a ridiculous story, awful environment, and the vigors (the point of bioshock) are extremely underplayed and have no story implementation. What was once a survival horror game is now the posterchild of absurd MetaCritic scores.A good game, not what it should have been. Kind of like a Halo 4 but even more dissapointing. 75/100			"

Positives however include a wonderful (if not fully realized) setting, good performance, pretty grafix and good sound design. It's also about 12 or 14 hours long.6/10 its alright.			"

												Bioshock is classed by me as the best FPS game of all time. People say it's like Systemshock and in that case i say i have to buy Systemshock!The first Bioshock was such a good game that i got it through means that i would rather not discuss at first. Played all the way through. Bought it for the Xbox and seriously think if i should buy if on steam just to have it on my computer! I love it THAT much.Bioshock 2 got a lot of flak but i think it still is a good game. It's not as good as the first one but it's a worthy successor to a great game IMO.Now we got Infinite. I saw the trailers and got hyped out of my mind! It's Bioshock but it's in the sky and in a different time? COOL! Maybe we'll get something else, something new something that is just as good with a new twist!Well, what we go was a confusing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥with♥♥♥♥♥♥gameplay! yay?At first i didnt know what to think. The game wasnt horrible. But the more i think about it the more i realised that Bioshock Infinite is just the devs trying to hard to ♥♥♥♥ with your mind.""OOOOOH. Look multiverse theory! Are you confused yet?"" No. Im not confused since i realise that you are seriously just trying to mess with me.Thats the problem with a multiverse theory it gets hard to follow and messy in a heartbeat and they did it so poorly that i wanna smash my head against a beltsander in frustration! The settings go from one to another without really setting the mood and 90% of the time i dont really care since im going on to next version of Columbia in a few minutes.Thats the main problem for me. It doesnt matter if i kill characters in this universe since it  has no impact and in another universe and im supposed to care about said characters! Sometimes i see them die and they dissapear since we never hear from them again and leaves me wondering if they are alive in this universe but maybe they didnt even exist in this universe. So dont bother about them.The gameplay is downplayed so much it's stupid! In the first Bioshock you had the protagonist pockets. You ran around with half an army in your pockets and guided what weapons you should use with ammo! In this they went with the Duke Nukem Forever approch! 2 weapons no ammo! In Bioshock they put care and thought into the design of the weapons. Rapture had a weapons ban so people smuggled in weapons or made their own. You could see that with the grenadelauncher made of soupcans and the crossbow made from a pianowire and a bunch or spareparts! The shotgun looks like something you find over a fireplace and gets cooler as it gets upgraded. In Infinite the weapons act the same. They are boring and the upgrades offer no visual representation to show that you'upgraded them. In Bioshock you find the ""power to the people"" stations. Again made from junk that you find in Rapture. Very cool concept. The resistance fighters made their own weapons and fought Andrew Ryan and theres layers upon layers of cool backstory that you find out regarding Frank Fontaine, Andrew Ryan , Suchong and Tennenbaum all over the place. Backstory sprinkled with codes to safes and tips about stashes of loot everywhere. COOL♥♥♥♥♥♥ But in Infinite even the audiologs are boring! No backstory or anything just rants about how people were stupid and racist back in the days! Woopie! All to preserve the twist at the end and they couldnt even do that right!Booker is combstock! BOOM! just saved you 20 hours of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! you can thank me later. Seriously the only half decent thing they managed to put in this crap is Elisabeth. I like her but she's just a tool to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!She's one of the main reasons this game falls short! She's the one opening the rifts into other worlds and she's the carrot at the end of the stick. She's also the most aggrevating person to chase after in video game history. Theres a scene where Booker tries to talk some sense into her after he's clearly shown that he's taking her to a place she clearly does not want to go (New York and i dont blame her) She wants to go to Paris (Wrong move there too sweetheart!) and she slows him down with everything from parades to balloons! (CURSE THOSE DASTARDLY HELIUMBALLS!).I didnt have to pay for bioshock Infinite (Thankfully) But i did have to trade away my timestopper. If i had to choose Timestopper or Infinite i'd be paying a whole lot more Faceless void!			"

The art work and other aethestic talent poured into this game deserve props but the actual game underneath is a fairly linear, simple shooter.  Put bluntly,  on the PC it's a sprinkle-covered, hollowed-out dog turd but console-wise it's an enjoyable yet just slightly memorable experience that has a pretty face.			"

												Very few games move me enough to have me consider a second play through. BioShock Infinite is one of those games. From the story to the combat, I have enjoyed every last second of the Columbia experience. Please don't compare this to previous games with similar titles... and as such I will not compare them in this recommendation. What I will do is explain what I love about Infinite, and if it jives with what you also love in games, then you will enjoy this experience as well.For one, without any spoilers, the story is tremendous. Not Dickens or Shakespeare, but for Sci-Fi fans who enjoy stories that try to stretch the imagination, this definitely satisfies. Columbia itself is nicely fleshed-out with a lot of details. It's nice to see a city that is seemingly pleasant until you see the underlying fanaticism and bigotry. It is almost uncomfortable and off-putting, but makes the experience that much more real.Besides story and setting, the remaining piece would be combat, of which I found quite satisfying. If you're not a fan of bullet-spongy baddies you've definitely come to the wrong place. I played through on Hard the first time, and the game definitely gave me a challenge. With only two weapons to swap between and a limited amount of Salt for Vigors (read Plasmids), I had to be very careful. It was easy to get myself killed by running out into the open; movement and cover is key. Most of the weapons are satisfying although at first I was a bit confused by the red and blue ammo (each faction has similar weapons with their own sets of ammo); I think subsequent play-throughs I will focus on upgrading a handful of specific ones instead of spreading myself so thin. As far as Vigors are concerned, I have to admit I enjoyed some more than others. While many where useful, when I eventually got ""Return to Sender"" and ""Bucking Bronco"", I was in love. There is a good variety of the usual suspects such as fire and electricity, and some interesting combos you can get (and there is an achievement for finding them all if you're into that sort of thing) by say lighting someone on fire and then charging them to create a bunch of fire-bombs that spread throughout the area. Character building in Infinite is mostly about what weapons you upgrade, what Vigors you buy and upgrade, but also is a little bit about clothing. There are four pieces of clothing Booker can wear, each with its own passive bonus. A lot of the best clothing is found through exploration, so make sure you poke around the levels if you want to find something good. Over time you will find a set of gear that will complement your play style which is especially satisfying.For me, this is a game that will stay on my hard drive for a long while. I'm not much for clutter, so usually uninstall games after completion. While not as consistently replayable as Borderlands, I certainly expect to go through this story again as well as the two Burial at Sea DLC packs. If what I've written piques your interest, then go ahead and buy this game. Still unsure? It's old enough that you can find it somewhere online at a discount, so you really don't have much to lose. It's time for you to go visit Columbia today!			"

												This is the first game that I've ever played that was bad enough to bother writing a negative review for. The uninspired combat system (and controls that leave no middle ground between ""not turning"" and ""spinning in circles"", even with an adjustable sensitivity mouse) doesn't hold up to those of the previous games, this game's plasmid equivalents (""vigors"") provide uninteresting powers, and without them being a central plot point, or even having any obvious significance in the story, it seems that they exist solely so that Infinite could be called a Bioshock game.The story itself is so ridiculous that, if you read it in a book, you'd think it was a satire (and Poe's law be damned, no one could take it seriously). It follows the story of a floating city filled with a fanatical religion dedicated to the (literal) worship of America's founding fathers and also racism, possibly best exemplified by a bar where the the most prominent feature is a mural of a haloed John Wilkes Booth shooting Abraham Lincoln (complete with horns and red skin), visited not long after hearing a sermon about Washington crossing the Delaware (Incidentally, said mural was the point at which I closed the game and started looking up reveiws and ""let's plays"" to see if it got any better. Spoiler alert: It doesn't.). I surmise that the rationalization behind this schizophrenic mix of ideological parodies is this: the average person is not, in fact, violently opposed to either nationalism or religion, so to properly vilify your opponents (the general populace of Columbia) heavy handed (even anvilicious) racism was tacked on to remove moral ambiguity and guilt the other aforementioned ideologies by association, thereby justify shooting all the people who were literally just giving you free food and money.The writing was painful, too. The shift to a vocal protagonist was by no means a good one, since being reminded of what you should be thinking by your own character's voice makes for a shallow experience (""Augh! These heights are so scary!"" during a mediocre above-ground experience where falling to your death is, in fact, impossible), not to mention that every third voice clip was to the tune of ""huh?"" or  ""what's going on?"".I won't even get into the time-traveling multiverse garbage.It's really a shame, because I really enjoyed the previous 2 games in the series, but Infinite seems like a poor attempt to capitalize on the reputation of a popular franchise in spite of, essentially, being the worst possible political commentary on nothing at all.In the interest of fairness, I have to admit that the game looks really nice, but fancy graphics do not a good game make.

												If you like games where there's an amazing world (if you have the rendering muscle) you'll probably like this game. If you're looking for a game that rewards your mental sentiment or a game that even gives you a choice in the end; look elsewhere. My favorite BioShock is the first one. It had the right ballance of puzzles (hacking mini games) action (""zap'em then whack'em!) the right amount of plot twists (""Would you kindly"") the right amount of philosophy (worlds grity, you don't get to choose how you start but in the end you're what you make of yourself) So, my recomendation: meh. I could go on about rewarding failure but this is much much better than BioShock 2 (seriously, no backtracking!?)			"

												Everyone I know, knows I hate this game with an absolutely searing passion.Heavy spoilers, obviously.Before it's release, I was pretty excited for this game, pre-ordered a physical copy, paid extra for release date delivery. Besides the factor of simple hype, the previews made the game appear promising, made it look like a genuine innovation.The game pretended to extend an offer of deep, layered gameplay, varied enemy types, upgradable powers, and multiple ways to navigate given situations. It made a pretense of suggesting that it would tell a fulfilling and engaging story, one that, like it's predecessors, was enveloped in stories about extremist ideologies and their effects.If you expected any of these things from this game, that would be a mistake.However, I'm here not only to argue that the game is pitifully mediocre when stood next to the other two games in the franchise; rather, I'm also going to argue that the game is just pitifully mediocre all things considered.Let's get the positives out of the way.The game is beautiful, the colorful saturation of Columbia is great. Additionally, there's some great, albeit wasted, potential for a good story in the themes the game plays around with about sin and rebirth.Now, to the bulk of it, why this game is horrifically overrated and not even anything above mediocre.On its concept, this is supposed to be a city of nativists, of Americans who want to limit admittance to 'some' and exclude the 'foreign hordes'. There's lots of insane worship of the founding fathers and a lot of racism. Totalitarian collectivism too. Solid foundation for a setting, you could tell a story with all these different issues right? Well, Infinite isn't doing that, it has no interest in doing that.None of these ideas or problems are explored with any nuance or even with any gravity, there's no bite to the racism and no force to the ideology -- it is nothing BUT a setting, the game isn't commenting on or even showing different perspectives about any of these ideas. Instead, we're served up half-baked 'dad rescues his daughter multiverse adventure'! Yay!I think, when you analyze the twists and turns of the story, there's plenty of absolutely absurd and ridiculous plotholes in all the universe hopping that Elizabeth and Booker participate in -- I've heard plenty of rationalization, it doesn't work, this isn't well thought out, it's not a masterpiece, stop.However, I don't think that it's bad because of those plotholes. I think, even leaving those aside or assuming they don't exist, it's just a pretty weak story that lacks for any sort of meaning. The problem isn't the plotholes, the problem is that the writers decided to forgo crafting an interesting world that is telling human stories to write this ridiculous multiverse tale that is essentially one giant wink at the player.BioShock and BioShock 2 tell stories with specific characters, they have antagonists, protagonists, conflicts and resolutions. BioShock Infinite on the other hand, just like Star Wars Episode VII, is essentially just a huge, obnoxious wink saying, 'Hey, remember BioShock?'This story is the BioShock of all the BioShocks! All those BioShocks were just crude reflections of this BioShock, this is the real one! -- is what the writers are trying to communicate to the player.It's as if Ken Levine, looking at the previous entries to the series, the stories they told, and faced with the daunting task of telling a new story, presenting a new world, just shrugged his shoulders and said, 'What if we just presented the *appearance* of a new world and a new story, but actually, it was just this 'meta' wink and nod to the previous games and wasn't a story of it's own at all?Even worse, it's as if Levine couldn't convince himself that he was really making something new or interesting, so he retroactively explains the plots of the previous two games as simply different iterations of Infinite's. It's like he knows, he knows that this story has obnoxious similarities to them, he knows he's creatively bankrupt, and he knows that he's not trying to tell a new story here.Don't despair, says Levine, it's actually a brilliant stroke of genius! There's always a lighthouse, a man, a city, etc.! No! I didn't run out of ideas! Shut up! It's really clever! No one will notice how stupid and utterly empty of meaningful content this is!It's true, the other two games also had lighthouses, men and cities. You know what else they had? Real characters who received real development and real characterization. A city that had an actual history and had real themes to present. The common elements never made the game, rather the writing, the characters, and the environmental storytelling did.Here, Ken Levine is left in the figurative shadow of the lighthouse, and, unable to be bothered to tell a new story, this game's story is some strange attempt to convince the player that the shadow of the lighthouse and the city, the simple, boring frame of the elements common to all 3 games ARE THEMSELVES a sort of meta-narrative about a father who sold his daughter, who sinned and atoned, and who ultimately rescues her.Can I just ask a question? What in God's name IS this garbage? Why does it exist? If Ken Levine wanted to tell a story about a father who sinned and lost his daughter but ultimately made it right, why didn't he just do that? The basic framework I just described does NOT require that it be linked through multiverse sci-fi magic BS to the other titles, it doesn't require any multiverse magic nonsense at all!It's not even a good story if you think of it not as a BioShock game. It's hardly even a story as much as it is just some weird-sounding BioShock fanfiction. GUISE WHAT IF, LIKE, ALL THE BIOSHOCKS BOIL DOWN TO A MAN TRYING TO SAVE HIS DAUGHTER FROM AN IDEOLOGICALLY EXTREME CITY? THEN THE NEW GAME WILL JUST BE THIS CONSTANT WINK THAT SAYS, 'OUR WRITERS GAVE UP!' WOULDN'T THAT BE EPIC AND A GOOD FOUNDATION FOR A STORY?NO! THE ANSWER IS NO!What if, in Halo 4, there was no narrative, it was actually this pseudo-intellectual garbage where, in the end, Cortana explains that in an alternate universe, Chief IS the didact and they're just playing out the latest iteration of Chief's attempt to save her, but in reality, there's always a Spartan, there's always a girl, there's always the covenant.Essentially, what if you take the elements common to all the games and then try to tell a meta-narrative that makes all the conflicts and characters insignificant as it explains them as simply another iteration of the same, unavoidable pattern? Does that make for a brief 'wow' moment when the player has this explained to them? Yes. Does it make for a good story? No, no it doesn't.It is, at it's core, the absence of a real story or of real writing. It happens when the writers mistake the common elements for actual writing or simply run out of ideas.Hey, though, that's just the story, right? What about the gameplay? It's bad too!Hi! What is a gun-upgrade system in a game with a two weapon limit where you switch weapons frequently b/c of limited ammo? The correct answer is pointless!What are a series of powers and abilities against enemies that all die in a few shots in constrained, linear shooting galleries? Useless? Yes!What is a rail system that allows for some amount of mobility but is mostly just used as a transition or for cutscene setpieces? A gimmick? Yes!What are transdimensional tears in reality? Are they varying ways to approach a given situation? No, they're not, they're just pointless!What is a 10-hour long campaign of shooting galleries that plays like a Call of Duty campaign but with a plot that is less-well executed, with all of the mechanics and depth that made its predecessors interesting removed? One of the most critically-acclaimed games of all time? For some reason, haha, yes! Kill me!Haha, wow this game sucks!			"

												One of the worst sequels ever made. Everything is a step down from the original: Story, gameplay, setting. Everything.Gameplay is Call of Duty tier: kill hordes of mundane enemies over and over completely lacking any thought or satisfaction in the deed.  Guns are terrible. Seriously, there is not one gun in the game I do not reflect back upon with utter distain. In the original Bioshock weapon and plasmid upgrades were bought through separate resource pools. But in this game, EVERYTHING, and I mean EVERYTHING, is bought through the same pool. This means you don't have any room to experiment with the ""Vigor's"" (which are just cut & pastes from the older game), and have to invest in solid shoot'em'up tactics because when you get right down to it, Vigor's are just something to call this game a ""Shock"" game and not a ""Call of Dutes"" game. You can only carry two guns at once, and there is easily 10+♥♥♥♥♥♥tier guns polluting the gun pool with their ammo. Which means in certain engagements, your main upgraded guns will likely run out of ammo and you'll be forced to use terrible re-skins in their place. Shooting guns is sticky, slow, tedious and all around not fun.Story takes a dive 1/4th into the game and from there on its a run and gun shoot'em up, all the way to the end with its exceptionally ill thought out ending (which doesn't resolve anything), but makes scrubs who don't want to feel stupid for not getting the ending shower it in praise for ""depth"", when in actuality it's simple, dull & poorly thought out. Ken Levine Scrapped the real Bioshock Infinite when he ran out of time wasting it on MP no one wanted, and was forced to put this♥♥♥♥♥♥out on the market. Literally, nothing promised in the original hype was delivered. Everything was recycled from the REAL Bioshock Infinite to create a presentable new game, and it certainly shows. Especially in character dialogue.Setting is un-imaginative and in comparison with Rapture, Columbia doesn't hold any water (no pun intended). In Rapture, the city felt like a living enemy. The ocean and crumbling city always loomed with you, and you were always aware that you were in a tin-can with a sheet of flexi-glass between you and death. In Columbia, you can just jump off the side and insta respawn with no consequences Super Meat Boy style. Enemies lack explanation or purpose in the world of Columbia, (take the fireman & patriot) & those that do are incredibly un-original or just half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥(crow racist people, Handy-Man).If you buy this game, I have no sympathy for you. Enjoy your middle of the game♥♥♥♥♥♥tier boss battle with Ghost lady 3 times over, while trying to justify your purchase by telling people like me ""it was 2deep4u"".			"

												There will be Spoilers.I was very disappointed with this game, having played it after finishing the first Bioshock game. The writing seemed very lazy, offering cliche time travel explanations for much of the experience, and unrealistic character behavior left and right. The character of Elizabeth was not particularly likable and was a complete Mary Sue (pretty much flawless, unrealistically skilled in various implausible facets). The storyline concerning her didn't very much interest me. I could not relate to her at all.The main Protagonist, Booker Dewitt, was a bumbling nobody who toppled an entire nation, capable of challenging the United States, single handedly. We have all seen many games able to pull off this type of protagonist in more believable ways than Infinite. He comes off as some cliche "" evil with a heart of gold""  type of guy. I happen to be sick of this type of character.I didn't like the low amounts of ammo found in the game, and how you would have to abandon your upgraded weapon for a cheap handgun many times due to the lack of ammunition and the limited number of carried weapons allowed at one time. Superior weapons found near the end of the game also reminded you of the useless thousands of dollars spent into upgrading the earlier weapons.I am used to the tedium of backtracking in video games and I don't usually count it against a game unless it is exceptionally tedious. In a game where there are MULTIPLE UNIVERSES, why are the revisited areas almost exactly the same? Some color being different, or a swapped out statue in one universe was not enough to impress me, and it felt cheap and lazy (Does the same architect posess the ability to traverse worlds and walk planes of realitiy through tears in space/time, just like Elizabeth?Seriously?).Vigors. Useless, useless vigors. I was very disappointed with the vigors. Throughout the entirety of the game, as soon as the lightning Vigor was available, it became the exclusive one used. Barring the times where the game needed you to use a different Vigor ability to progress, Lightning was more than enough to get through the game easily, especially with the upgrades it unlocks. That is not to say I would have wanted to use any of the other vigors anyway, they seemed so boring and useless to use. Why don't enemies use Vigors? Except for those few special enemies with increased health, why don't average Columbians use Vigors? What's up with that?Elizabeth being able to lockpick seems like a forced reminder to keep the illusion of how useful she is. It's strange how many large, important places of interest have their security entrusted to the same cheap, flimsy lock. Columbia sure would be a breeze for Jill, the master of unlocking, to get around in.Only two weapons at a time. You can only carry two. Irrational games decided to hate fun this time around, I suppose. It's not like there is any large tactical advantage or disadvantage to carrying one over the other, it's like they tried to go for realism in this lone, weird gesture, when they tried it with nothing else. All it did was leave you no option, in some situations, but to weild a rocket launcher in a small narrow corridor, ensuring that you would lose precious health.Constants and Variables. That is what Elizabeth tells you after you inquire about the nature of the tears in space/time. ""Constants and Variables?"" ""Yes."" and it is left at that.Yeah, whatever you say, Irrational Games.You cannot carry medkits or salts. Why not? ""Because we said so"", say the men in the cubicles.This game sucked.			"

												Bioshock Infinite has the biggest potential yet failed quite hard. Gameplay is nothing like from the previews while the actual gameplay really needed to be polished. The game storywise is a huge messed, keeps on jumping to theme and theme while making me care less for characters as the story goes on and there’s certain plot elements that does not make sense. Elizabeth is the most likable character yet there is some strange characterization to the context of her situation and the previews show that she supposed to be more helpful outside of giving ammo and potions. Environments graphics are good but character details, besides Elizabeth, is very poor and the game keeps struggling with my computer even when I but the game at its lowest graphics. If you’re still curious of this game despite my warnings then I highly recommend you to buy this game on a HUGE discount.Atleast the game better than Mass Effect 3 :P			"

												BioShock Infinite - игра в жанре шутера от первого лица,последняя часть серии BioShock,разработанная компанией Irrational Games и издана 2K Games.Сюжет разворачивается в 1912 году,в городе Колумбия,городе,который парит в воздухе,с помощью дирижаблей или иначе Квантовой Левитацией. Девитта Букера доставляют Роберт и Ризалинда Лютес на остров с маяком, они ему поручают привести им девушку по имени Элизабет,в уплату долгов.Так же вышло 2 дополнительных эпизода Burial at Sea, действие готорых происходило в декорациях 1 части и 2 частях игры. Букер работает частным детективом в подводном городе Восторг. К нему приходит Элизабет,которая просит найти девочку Салли,.Дополнение сменило жанр игры,теперь это стелс-экшен. Второй эпизод даёт  влзможность сыграть нам за Элизабет,которая всё так же ищет девочку пропавшую Салли. Её чуть не убивает Атлас,здешний атнтагонист,но она сказала ему,что может помочь ему добраться до Колумбии и поэтому он не убил её.Этот эпизод тоже стелс-экшен,но в нём Элизабет не многое может противопоставить вргам,так что здесь ещё большая скрытность.Оценки Геймплей 8Графика 8Музыка 8Сюжет 9В игре особенно  хорошо выдались сюжет и  визуальная составляющая. Прекрсный финал всей серии.			"

												The combat in this game was pretty fun.  It was fresh and exciting, at least at first. The skylines were fun to zip around and made for some challenging fast paced combat. The amount of detail that went into building this new world to explore was insane. It had a distinctive voice of it's own but still fit in with the rest of the franchise very nicely. However, I did find the gameplay to get a bit repetitive towards the end. There wasn't a whole lot of strategy that went into the combat and I found I could stumble through any encounter without too much thought. I also just didn't care for the story much, this could just be me but,  it felt like they just kept dragging on the ending for eternity and it made the last two hours or so of gameplay horrifically boring. I understand in this genre of story telling that its intentional to leave a lot questions unanswered and have the audience wondering just what exactly they experienced but, it just felt poorly executed in the long run.In general, I'd say I would've felt better if I had perhaps rented this rather then spend the forty bucks on it. I don't regret playing it but, I just wasn't terribly impressed and probably won't play it again. "

												This game is absolutely amazing. You can tell that there was an enormous amount of thought put into every detail, down to the very last corner. Bioshock Infinite is my favorite game to date, no question about it.To start, the art direction is very good. Everything is arranged to be very appealing, and the colors are very balanced. I loved just walking around the city and soaking it all up. There are 1912 style shops to go into, and they are all populated. In one area, there is even a good, three-minute quartet that you can just sit and listen to. I was very impressed with the magnitude of everything. Seldom are you placed in a small, dark room or hallway. Most of the game is set in colorful areas with large statues and airy buildings.I liked that it did not actually put you in the dark, but gave a dark feeling when it was appropriate. As per the Bioshock games, some of the events are quite dark, and I liked the uneasy feeling without the dark corridors of Rapture.Combat is a step up from other games in the genre. The introduction of ""skylines"" allows you to jump quickly from place to place, making everything very fast paced. I didn't quite like the inventory management as much as in the original Bioshock, however. I found it much harder to deal with my Vigors, mainly because you couldn't just scroll through them like in the other game. Still, you get used to it - that's a fairly minor gripe.I can not say much about the story. If I told you what was so great about it, I would spoil it for you. I can say that it puzzled me, and it was a few hours after finishing the game that I worked everything out. I felt like some of the points were repeated too much though. I get that they try to help everyone understand it well, but I would rather just have it all thrown at me - that way it's more fun to work out on my own.Overall, Irrational Games has gone above and beyond what anyone expected. The only way you would find this game worse than the original is if you are somewhat nostalgic. Even if you did not like the first or second game, I highly recommend that you still give Bioshock Infinite a try. As a side note, there are a few things that you will not quite understand if you skip the first game. They are little details, but in a game like Bioshock Infinite, it is the little details that really count.This game is worth every cent. If you can not afford it, you can wait until the next sale. The trilogy tends to go for $15~.Some screenshots:

												Bioshock infinite is a typical sequel that is quite lazy, even though techinally it isn't a sequel it still feels like it.Columbia is a nice world to explore however this does not excuse the gunplay being one of the worst I've seen in my life, however you could say this is just my opinion but they went for the boring 2 weapon system that forces you into certain weapons or else the game will be very hard.The vigors are basically reskinned from Bioshock and they made even less sense then in Bioshock 1 considering these things are just magic from the looks of it ingame.Many people praise the story and the apparent non-linearity but I disagree with those people because it follows the typical damsel in distress(providing some money/supplies help is a very small expection) with no real morals. And it is so short I got about 8 hours out of it and I didn't rush through it, hell I spend like 2 hours walking around but the story is so short that it made me think I was halfway at a point but the game was over then. And the plot gets so bad and illogical eventaully with certain aspects being cheaply used.At least the game is very polished and bug free.4/10 Somewhat intresting story but incredible short, bad in gameplay and overpriced for what it is. Just my opinion though.			"

												I got to say that this game was a huge dissapointment and this is coming from a fan of the original bioshock titles. Almost everything is worse in infinite compared to bioshock 1 and 2.You can only hold 2 weapons at once which makes it so the game has the typical modern ""we only give you the weapon you need for the situation"" style. The weapons are all very boring, a rifle, a machine gun, shotgun, sniper... Very unoriginal and boring weapons and the upgrades for them are only ""better ammo capacity"", ""more damage"". Very generic and unoriginal. There is a noticably lower amount of vigours/plasmids/powers in infinite and there is a more limited amount of salt/eve so you can'ät use them as much. The levels are very linear and are therefor not very interesting and you never have any problems with resources such as ammo or health. Another very dissapointing aspect is that several of the special enemies did not get implemented the way they were promised too especially the more interesting ones. The only redeeming aspect is the story of the game and that might be worth your time but for the full price I can seriously not recomend this game for anyone as long as you don't believe that the story alone is worth it.Play the first two games if you want something really good and skip this one or pick it up on sale but for full price I would say no.

												(Mostly spoiler free)When all's said and done, a fairly disappointing game. The gameplay is certainly subpar, with lots of elements removed from previous titles. There is a nicely large variety of weapons, but this is completely undermined by the utterly unnecessary two weapons limit, which serves only to stifle player choice and undermine the upgrade system as well. Enemy variation isn't much to write home about. The regenerating shield is the first time that regenerating health has been tried in this series, and unfortunately really hurts the combat, since it makes cowering behind boxes and popping out to fire one of the most effective combat tactics. Also the only boss fights which occur in this game are terrible. Not just hard, but horribly designed: infinitely respawning enemies, limited weapons and a bullet sponge boss, with money deducted and enemy health restored every time you die.The story starts off quite strongly, although as more of the plot is revealed, plot holes spring up all over the place and the conclusion is confusing, rife with its own plot holes and unsatisfying. The world is also poorly constructed, with the player murdering hundreds of innocent people for the crime of being law enforcement officers, then continuing to have normal conversations with Elizabeth, making Booker seem completely insane. Vigors are an adapation of plasmids from earlier games, but while plasmids were integral to the plot in Bioshock, vigors are very much an afterthought, with basically no bearing on how the city operates.Elizabeth as a character is confusing. She has spent her whole life locked up in a tower, yet seems to be normally socially adjusted, which seems unusual. As a gameplay element, she is strangely shoehorned in. She cannot be injured or captured by enemies, who will completely ignore her, and can occasionally ""find"" ammo, health or salt (vigor power) around the battlefield, although these are not available through standard searching, only through Elizabeth. Her addition to gameplay is redundant, and only serves as an excuse for poor design in terms of ammo.Visual design is fantastic, but there is little else to recommend about this short game, especially replay value. Don't buy it.			"

I am as passionate about this series as any fanatic is about whatever they are obsessed with.BioShock will always have a special place in my life post of completing Infinite.I would recommend not only this game, but BioShock, BioShock 2 also.If you are thinking about buying this, do it, have fun, and pay attention.

												If you are bored of endless mmos and rpgs, if you are craving for a story that will change your world perception for the rest of your life and, simply have a good taste, then BioShock Infinite is definitely for you. Third part in the game series (without counting the DLCs) has one of the most mind-blowing stories you've ever seen/read/written. The whole of BioShock keeps you hooked on till the end, but this one is something different.The great and powerful Prophet and brave and self-sacrificial Booker DeWitt along with charming and stuff-out-of-nowhere Elizabeth will lead you through a beautiful and magnificent world of Columbia, so thoroughly built by Irrational Games. Until the very end you will be questionning the whole point of the game and wonder why someone would put so much effort into a story that you cannot even understand. Tell you what - it is worth it. As soon as you finish the game and in madness go on multiple forums to find the answers to your questions, you will be blown away by what has really happened under your nose.     Buy it, download it, copy from your friend's computer - do anything you can to enjoy this piece of a true artwork.			"

Well (if you can call them that) one particular boss battle dragged on for too long (in my opinion), but please don't let that take you away from the experience. In short, this game if a fine work of art and a good standard for FPS games, adventure games and videogames in general.10/10 would get mind♥♥♥♥ed again :)			"

												Bioshock Infinite is a gorgeous first person shooter that takes place in a utopian, steampunk version of early 20th century America. The story centers around Booker Dewitt, a man who enters the floating city of ""Columbia"" looking to capture a certain girl as part of a deal to have his debts ""wiped away."" This game is very pretty to look at, and the gameplay is solid for a shooter game.Pros:+Solid shooter gameplay. The ability to purchase ammo from vending machines means you can often keep your preferred weapon for a long time, rather than simply using whatever you find like in most shooters. There is a wide variety of weaponry to choose from.+""Vigors,"" basically supernatural attacks with limited use, also add to the gameplay.+The game takes place in a utopian city in the sky. The amount of detailing put in to the environments is very high. It's a very pretty game to look at from start to finish.+Probably one of the most unique stories I've seen in a game. Having seceded from the Union, the city of Columbia flew into the sky. Now ruled by a corrupt religious cult, the city's beautiful exterior hides the intense racial discrimination and corrupt religious practices going on within.+The ending is unexpected and stuck with me for a while after finishing the game.+Multiple difficulties available, plus an extra hard ""1999 mode"" that gets unlocked after beating the game.+Above average Linux port.Cons:-Only lasted me 19 hours, and I play slow.-No multiplayer.-Ocassionally the game gives too many hints rather than just letting the player just figure things out for themself. However, this game is almost 100% combat and no puzzles, so this problem is almost negligible.-Sometimes the game makes you hit odd keyboard keys, like the enter key for example. This is a horrible key choice, since hitting enter means I have to reach all the way across the keyboard. However, this is never requested of the player during combat, so it isn't a real problem.This game's length can change drastically based on how much the player goes out of their way to explore the environment. Exploration yields money, ammo, health and other things. I tried to explore every area as much as possible, so my 19 hour game time is probably higher than average.Overall this game is a sight to behold. For those for whom FPS is their favorite genre, missing this game would be like stabbing yourself in the foot. Back when it was new and on a $60 price tag, the game's underwhelming length would have been a discouragement for some. But now that it is a couple years old and half the price, it's more than worth it.			"

												First 3 hours amazing, last 3 hours good. Everything in between was meh. Still the same bleh combat from every other bioshock, I reccomend just youtubing it unless you really like sci fi.Why WHYYY diddnt they just stick with alternate history. John Wilkes booth house was best part of game, downhill from there if you played it for the historical factor.			"

												Awesome story, combat is somewhat repetitive. The addition of skyhooks made the game more vibrant and generally more fun to play. You are restricted to two weapons at a time; this can be annoying as you have little chance to prepare for what's coming up next. You should definitely get this game, despite its minor flaws.			"

												Bioshock Infinite review,What can I say? This game pushed the boundries of the original bioshock, literally. From a city under the sea, to a city in the sky. This game was simply amazing. A private detective named Booker Dewwit has been involed in a indebting with the wrong people, so, he is sent by them to find a girl named 'Elizabeth' who has been trapped in the city in the sky. (AKA. Colombia). Booker soon finds out that this is no ordanariy job, but in fact, something above his standards (Pun intended). As he explores the town of colombia, The backstory of the founder (Zachary Hale Comestuck), and every single barrel and garbage bin for coins and food. He soon finds out that there is a man who is called the 'False Shepard', an enemy to colombia. as you go deeper into the city you find out that the 'false shepard' has a sort of signiture for himself, two initials  on the back of his hand spelling A.D. Which to his suprize are the excact same initials Booker has on the back of his hand.The game always keeps you guessing from the start, and even to the end. With the genres switching from an action to a sort of horror. With reacurring enimies with increaced difficulty. And what bioshock is best at, The twists.This is one of the most enjoyable and mysterious games i have ever played with as little flaws as possible. I would reccomend it to anyone who asks me about it.I give it a 9.5/10			"

												Bioshock infinite is one of the best fps of all time. There are multible weapons with several upgrades that feel really different and there are also vigors which are unique powers that help you in battle, for example possession can control enemy humans and machines making them on your side for a while and when its over they do sucide. It also has the best video game buddy of all time, 1 you dont have to protect her 2 She gives you money,ammo,health, and salts exactly when you need them. She can open tears which are different dimesions that can give you weapons, sentry buddy, health and more. All that plus a very good setting and story that is complex and intriguing makes this a absolute buy. 10\10 It can be bought on steam for 30$ and it is well worth it			"

												Oh. My. God. This game. There are not enough words to describe in such a MAGNIFICENT game in such a short recommendation. First and foremost, one of the most beatiful, most emotional, and active story lines EVER in a game. I would recommend it just based on that. But no! It gets better. The combat is INNOVATIVE, FUN, and does NOT get boring. Although unlike the original bioshocks, you can only carry 2 weapons at once. The vigors (plasmids) are fun, but I usually only stuck to one or two myself. Finally, the characters. My god. The characters. So engaging, so entertaining, and they make you feel so connected to them. One of the best games of 2013, one of the best games ever. Do NOT, I repeat, no NOT be the one to miss out on this game, this experience!			"

												While this game looks stunning and the story is pretty good, the gameplay lets it down.Having played the first two i expected the combat to be improved, but it just got dumbed down.This game is story first with some shooting thrown in.When you first start playing you will be blown away by great visual scenes.You get to walk through some really cool looking areas, which help set the scene of the story.But other than that has little to offer. Combat is mostly arena style areas which only becomes challenging after you've completed the game and unlocked 1999 mode.So as far as the FPS side if it goes, its very boring and felt like an after thought.Being pretty short without any replayability, its definately not worth the full price, but if you can pick it up on sale its worth it.But really you're better off getting the first two.Game of the Year? i think not.So i would recommend only if its cheap			"

												Bioshock Infinite.No game has made me care more than this. No game has left me wanting more than this. No game can compair to this. This game is not JUST a game, It's a medium. A medium for all games now. This is a game that you can hold up to people who are against games as a medium, and show them that games CAN and SHOULD be taken seriously. This is a game that has been perfected to the very highest that is humanly possible. Not only are the game functions amazing, what adds to this game and makes it what it is, are the Characters, Story, Setting, and Voice Acting. No other game has had this high of a production value in a very long time, delayed three times, Worked on since 2006, 7 years in the making. This game shows that now, gaming as a medium can be just as good as this, maybe even better. The aesthetics and atmosphere add for immersion, the characters are beleivable, And you CARE about them, The gamplay, while simple, can bring players even further into the immersion. You can't mention Bioshock Infinite without bringing up Elizabeth, She's the, If you will, ""Brains"" of the game. The game would not be the same without her. Her movements are realistic, her expressions are full of life, and her personality is lovable. During combat she throws you supplies and can get you in to all kinds of locked gates, doors, and safes, Which in turn makes her even better; as she adds to the gameplay immersion while not being in the way. There are plenty of weapons, vigors, and you can't forget the fast-paced Skylines. The story is what makes this game what it is as well. From the start you know something is wrong with the city, some...dark undertone that you can't put your finger on. Since the Original bioshock was such a shocker with its chilling twists and turns in the plot, Everyone expects this game to have a twist, you'll be waiting for it, thinking you're ready, but when it comes...Oh trust me; You will NOT be ready. This game is revoutionary, it does new things, while keeping that old Bioshock feeling, The city of Columbia feels life-like, Elizabeth is possibly, The best A.I. ever, And the story keeps you entertained, and by the end; you'll be wanting so much more. Buy this game. It's worth it. If you don't like games, get it. If you are just a casual gamer, this is a game you can hold up and be proud that you spent your time on it. If you can't stand Bioshock 1, still, get it. It does new and old, while adapting to this day and age of games, it stays true, while doing so much more, and reaching new goals and hights. Whoever you are, This game will appeal to you, no doubt. Because this is a game that will be remembered for years. A game that, years later, will be looked upon as the one that changed everything. This game, is a true sequel, and one of the best damn games I ever have, and will play. And you need to experience it for yourself.What do I rate it? 10/10 - A Must Own			"

The game is very confusing but after watching some theory videos on Youtube, the game gets even better. For any that are thinking about buying this game, I highly suggest getting it ASAP! This game and its expansions will make you love and hate each character and ultimately want more of them after playing through.Also as a warning, the end of Episode 2 will make you cry your heart out.

 ""Booker, are you afraid of God?""""No, I'm afraid of you."" Disclaimer: While I don't talk about things that are major to the plot, I WILL talk about things that were revealed before the game was released.TL;DR: Overall, it's amazing. The story is great, but sometimes illogical and clichéd. The combat has been downgraded from BioShock 2, but it is still good enough that you can have fun for probably like 2 playthoughs(enough to see everything the game has to offer). Everything else is great, especially the sound.BioShock Infinite is the third installment to the BioShock series, and if you really look at it, it's BioShock 2. The real BioShock 2 is an expansion more than anything to BioShock 1. So, BioShock Infinite is as tradition, a story-driven narrative FPS game. It's been critically acclaimed and is considered the 'best FPS ever made', and I met a LOT of people calling it 'perfect'. A lot more than you would definitely expect. Then is BioShock Infinite that good? Not really. But that happens with games. And this game is still really really good.The game takes place in the flying city of Columbia. You are Booker DeWitt, a former Pinkerton and now a hired gun, sent to Columbia to rescue a girl trapped within the city in order to pay off a debt. The most interesting of all choices Irrational made with BioShock Infinite is that they implemented a talking protagonist- not just a talking protagonist, but there are backstories and plot-related things that are surrounding him. Ken Levin himself, the head writer for BioShock 1 and this game, said that making a talking protagonist was a LOT harder to write with then a silent one. So seeing that change was a bit surprising, but not that major since this game takes in a completely different but similar environment than the previous games.Columbia, in hindsight, is a beautiful city, but you'll quickly find out that the entire city is built on Nationalism(specifically on America) and Racism, and the city is a social commentary on these issues, and I enjoyed them. Though, the city is also built on religion, which at first was weird because BioShock 2 was a bit about religion, but Ken Levine was NOT involved in BioShock 2 whatsoever, so that can be accepted.But the entire game is actually in fact NOT about these philosophies. For some reason, folks at Irrational wanted to make BioShock Infinite about alternate dimensions. Huh. Weird approach, but I really liked it. Not very original, but they still somehow managed to fit it in with the world and the execution was great.So let's elaborate on these alternate dimensions. Elizabeth, the girl you have to save, has the power to open 'Tears', which is a doorway to another world. It works both in gameplay AND the plot; you can summon guns or cover and such from the other worlds to aid you in battle, or sometimes you'll just go to another world! Though you can't just make Tears out of thin air(the game say Elizabeth COULD, but now she can't).I won't talk about the story longer- but trust me, it's really good. I don't think it's as good as what people say, and I think it's not THAT original and clever, but the character interaction(which I can't talk about for long) and the writing itself really won me over. But... let's face it, in BioShock games; in ANY FPS games, you're going to be running around and shooting people. Then shoot people again. Watch a cutscene(not in this game though, there aren't that many cutscenes), and shoot some more people. At least, for 50% the time, you're going to be shooting people, not listening to characters talk. That's why the gameplay is so important, and this is where BioShock Infinite fails only a bit.First problem. You can only carry around two weapons. ...yes. There are NO explanations for this, even though in the previous BioShock games you could carry around 10 ♥♥♥♥ing guns at once, in this game, you can't do that. This really limits the tactical choices you can do in the combat because you can't predict the future. There'll be a point where you would say ""I wish I had this and this gun right now"", and that's not good. It prevents the player from having fun.There is also a lot of stuff they took out such as the Research Camera. Now I'll admit it, the Research Cameras in BioShock 1 and 2 were a broken mess gameplay-wise, but they still somehow worked and it fit right in the sci-fi heavy world that BioShock games have. They could have easily fixed it and put it into the game, put they decided it wasn't worth their time.This game also has some RPG elements with upgrades and such, which was present with BioShock even before it came out with System Shock. But the upgrades in Infinite are really dull and disappointing. You have your generic 'Damage Boost 1/2', 'Recoil Decrease', 'Reload Increase', etc. Really really dull. And I'm emphasizing this because BioShock 2 had great upgrades that were tied in with the Cameras. With the Rivet Gun, if you upgrade it fully, you can set people on fire! How cool is that! Not very useful admitibly in late-game, but still cool and it shows they put effort into it. Not in Infinite though.They HAVE implemented a brand new feature: Gears. You can get different kind of hats, shirts, pants and boots and they will give you passive upgrades to you, similar to Gene Tonics from the previous games. Unlike weapons, you can switch out Gears at ANY TIME. Wow. They did this with Gears but not weapons. I still don't understand that... but anyways, the gears are actually pretty fun to use(unlike Gene Tonics) and it also heavily encourages exploration as they will be your prime rewards for exploring the world, and BioShock has always been about exploration.There are also not a lot of enemy types, and this one enemy called the 'Siren' is basically just a chore to fight in higher difficulties. While this is a thing with a LOT of FPSs, it still doesn't excuse it. What I DO like about the gameplay is just the rest of it: the guns overall feel satisfying, but the actual gun variety is also pretty small. And 'Vigors', which are basically Plasmids, has more of the same concept, but the execution is done MUCH better then Plasmids. But again, sadly, there are only a few Vigors in the game.One things I also really like are the Sky-Lines and the Freight Hooks. You can climb on to a Freight Hook and gain height advantage, or ride around in these semi-monorails and fling around and such, It's really fun to use and the Gears also encourage the players to use Sky-Lines since there are a lot of Sky-Line related Gears. There is also a 'Shield' mechanic in the game; not original and not very well executed. A lot of times it pops out of nowhere and ruins the immersion.Let's talk about some minor parts. The graphics are vastly improved, and the world is very colourful. But there are some parts that are reminiscent of the original horror-type environments of BioShock 1 and 2. The sound design is AMAZING. Occasionally, you will hear present-day Classic Rock songs converted into 1910s-type western-feel songs, and boy, they are amazing covers. They are definitely one of the best part in the entire frickin' game.I COULD'VE gone for another paragraph about the game's story(and how it sometimes doesn't make sense), but the writing is just great in general and the storytelling is also great that you should experience it yourself. I personally thought some parts didn't add up, and some parts are only explained in the DLC, and some parts are just clichéd, but overall it was great.Overall, BioShock Infinite is an amazing game. Definetely would have been GOTY if it wasn't for the best game ever made(GTA V, wink wink) that also came out in 2013. I urge you to grab ALL of the BioShock games, and grab the Season Pass for this game as it adds a story DLC that wraps the entire series up nicely. I give BioShock Infinite a 8.8/10, it's a must own for its fairly cheap price tag.			"

												When this was coming out, everyone was calling it Game of the Year, that is, until The Last of Us came out, an then GTA V came out. While I didn't play any of these two, I can definietely say that Bioshock Infinite deserves to be called Game of the Year.Many FPS games today are basically multiplayer with little to no single player campaign. This is not the case. This is a big, well-made singleplayer adventure set in the floating city of Columbia , in the year 1912. The story is told in a good way with all the cutscenes done in-game.Graphically, the game is stunning, the environment are beautiful and sometimes artistic and the lighting effects are amazing. The characters have a rather semi-realistic look, nut that doesn't mean the game is not serious. This is what this genre lacks in general: COLORS. It's really nice to see a living, more colorful areas instead of gray or brown. The animations were smooth and nice too.I really liked the music and all those radios etc. playing in the city. It really makes you feel like you're the part of the world. I really liked the voice acting as well. When it comes to gameplay... I loved it, and I'm not a great fan of first person shooters. You get to use a range of different weapons as well as several powers to use against your enemies. The combat is solid and works well. Aside from weapons and powers you can also use melee attacks with a Sky-Hook that also allows you to cling onto freight hooks and go along rails in the air which is awesome. There're other things to do aside from just going to your goal and killing those who oppose you. All throught the world you'll find audio files of different characters, which add some detail to the story, as well as small old-school videos and telescope to look into. Even upgrades for health, salts and shield are often well-hidden, so the game really wants you to explore more, instead of just going from point A to point B. The game took 11 hours to beat for me and I have found majority of collectibles, I still had some left. The game still was a little short in my standards. It was still REALLY worth it, especially for the price since I loved every second of it. I loved the presentation, I loved the gameplay, the powers, the characters. It is clearly a game where developers put EFFORT into it.I'll probably get the DLC and the previous games in the series because I just want more.

												Buy. This. Game. Now....no seriously. I'll wait. Oh, you haven’t bought it yet? And you want a (average) review on it? Alright then, here it goes. This is a masterpiece. People are relating it to Half Life 2, and Uncharted based on how good it is. It currently holds a meta critic score of 96/100 which is almost unseen of. The graphics and visuals in this game are absolutely stunning. You can easily get lost in this game's atmosphere looking for money, looting every corner of every place you visit, listening to the conversations between NPCs, reading the extremely well-designed advertisements located on walls, posters etc... I can go on all day. The amount of love and craftsmanship that went into this excellent piece of work is jaw-dropping. If you have the chance play this game on Ultra Settings, the graphics are almost better than life, its that good. Take the time to look at the detail on your weapon, or a poster on a wall, and I assure you, you WILL NOT see any sort of distortion or pixels (except when zooming in with a sniper). That my friends, is how detailed the world is. The gameplay pretty decent honestly, but nothing to special. You have your standard FPS gameplay, shooting your weapons, blowing off enemies’ heads and what not, but also has its own twist. Similar to the old bioshock titles, you can equip and weapon in one hand while casting lightening spells at your enemies with the other, or perhaps sending a flock of crows to eat away at your enemies flesh as you gun him down. The story as you progress is very good. You start to form a relationship with the character Elizabeth as she aids you throughout the game (also her character design is awesome, like something out of a Pixar movie). Toward the end of Bioshock Infinite the story starts to go full circle. But without spoiling, I did scratch my head for a good 5 minutes toward the last 30 seconds of the game, trying to figure out what just happened. But once I figured this interestingly beautiful (in an odd way) ending, I was satisfied. Sadly thought this game took me about 8 hours to complete on Medium, which is quite decent. I also play a lot of FPS games so there wasn’t much challenge for me. But next time I get the chance I will be doing a Hard run, just to give myself a bit more of a challenge, and to relive the atmosphere.Turn off all the lights in your room, put on some high quality headphones, turn the graphics on Ultra (if you can), and strap in because Bioshock Infinite, is easily going to take hours of your life away, as you explore this beautiful and extremely detailed world. Bioshock Infinite easily earns a 9 / 10. "

												""Best Game Ever 2014"" is a FPS story based shooter. The story is exceptionally well and if you take your time it will become very immersive. The environments and graphics throughout the game are immersive and atmospheric. The game has a lot to take in at the start and becomes even better later on. Not spoiling anything but the ending was amazing, even to this day i am finding out more and more about the Bioshock universe. It is very detailed and will blow your mind.Gunplay and other game mechanics are solid and AI is not annoying.Best Game Ever 2014 gets a 10/10			"

												Throat-constrictingly intense combat to make you feel robust and savvy, art direction and atmosphere to overwhelm and astound you, a licensed soundtrack to die (a million million times) for, a cartoony doe-eyed sidekick throwing a tantrum for a million gamers' waifu status, and spectacle of a very high magnitude all do a wonderful job of making sure you never think hard enough to notice the story doesn't actually make a great deal of sense. An excellent game and worthy experience, but a greater, craftily clever ode to and excuse for Ken Levine's rusty toolkit.			"

												Most of us have all played the stellar Bioshock 1 and 2, and we've all made the obvious comparisons in our head when we think of Bioshock Infinite: the weapon limit, linear level structure, and a new mind-bending story. Among the top complaints are these three nuances that play an exceptional and pivotal role in Infinite; to some, the streets of Columbia are too linear when compared to the openness of Rapture, to others, the new weapon system doesn't adequately compliment the new baddies, and to a stubborn select few, the story simply either makes no sense or isn't quite as memorable as the first installment. To each his own, I suppose, but when we consider these ""faults"" to hold the experience back, we make room for further diminishing of the series as a whole. We have to feel some empathy for the developers at Irrational and understand what kind of thought was put not only into Rapture's cavernous tunnels, but Columbia's banner-ridden streets.Unfortunately, I won't go into any detail about that stuff, because I don't (or didn't) work at Irrational, I wasn't there for the writing process, and I've never seen how these concepts fly into Ken Levine's head. What I CAN do, lacking this information, is NOT compare Rapture and Colombia at all. Bioshock Infinite is in a completely new setting, with completely new characters, and while it may follow some similar ideas and share a basic plotline, what we know about either game is so NOT subjective, so NOT interchangeable that it makes no sense to start comparing at all. They share the same title, so what? Vigors or Plasmids? Who cares? What difference does it make if Bioshock wants to take us into the sky for an adventure we can't quite explore so well as an underwater palace? There's a lot less room for walking up in the sky, mind you.If you found fault in the game not because you found inconsistencies regarding this and the 2007 giant, but because you simply couldn't get a grip on the controls, the mechanics, or the story, by all means, you have your victory, and there's no sense in fighting over a cause you've already won. However, I have one message to those who insist to deem such tremendous games to be similar only because they share rather malleable concepts: BREAK THOSE CHAINS. ARE YOU A MAN, OR ARE YOU A SLAVE? I'm not trying to insult, I'm not trying to incite argument, I'm only trying to remove the slight tarnish that comes with a reputation, be it good or evil. When Bioshock decides to move a few miles up out of the water, you COMMIT, you don't QUESTION why it's moved or try to calculate the actual distance between the two.Again, to each his own, but I don't like sitting back and watching a game become progressively reviled because it is by law a member of the Bioshock series and therefore must be treated as inferior to its predecessor. In time, all things will eventually pass, and I should save my ranting for the future, but for now, I hereby declare that you will find no error in any three of these games. Should you find error in any of them, please make certain that you are judging the game in its own right. While there are some franchises that DESERVE the compare/contrast treatment (Assassin's Creed and Call of Duty are the ostensible ones), Bioshock is NOT one of them.Buy it, play it, love it. Just don't let the gritty bluish sepia of another masterpiece ruin this one.			"

												If there was ever a video game that I would call literature, it would be this game. It's story is clear, concise, and creative. The characters invite you in, and I felt genuine emotions as the charactes felt it, along witha complete mind♥♥♥♥ ending. It explores morality, with it's main enemy being who he is, and the problems faced towards him (I would go more into depth, however, that would bhe going into some serious spoilers). It has you thinking the whole time into the world of the game, as it is set in 1912, and has the societal issues that came out of that time period, and with those being well integraeted into the plot. The character development is amazing, as the two main characters essentially swap personalities and feelings, and how sickening it feels to have someone in that situation evolve in the way theat they do.  The collectables in this game are audio recordings, and give an extra layer of depth into the characters, and setting.This game isn't a hard game, and I feel that anyone who needs to love video games should be given this game to enjoy.

												Bioshock Infinite is an absolutely awesome game. With beautiful graphic and great optimization it runs really smoothly on my machine. The story is gripping and very satisfying which is accompanied by a great soundtrack. The only thing I thought wasn't so great about the experience was the combat. It was very same-ey throughout the game and often detracted away from the main plotline.Either way I thoroughly reccommend this experience!			"

												I've never really had a favourite game. Favourite book? Yes, Favourite film? Yes. But never a game, there were so many great ones that I couldn't separate. At least until I played Bioshock Infinite & it took my Number 1 slot by a mile! In fact, before I would put the game on such a pedestall, I played it again within 6 months. I actually enjoyed it even more than the first time.I was gifted Biosock 1 by a friend as I like immersive, story driven games. Not only was the plot engaging & inovative, & the gameplay interesting & open to different styles, the game was a set in a fabulously good looking location. However, it built itself up so well, that a boss fight wasn't enough to do the story justice & I was left wishing they'd actually finished the plot, instead of simply ending the game.Bioshock 2 was more of the same, adding lots to the universe but resolving little. A good game on it's own, but didin't really do anything new.I expected more of the same from Bioshock Infinite, but I'm happy to say, I was left utterly, stupidly & soundly corrected.Bioshock Infinite takes what made Bioshock 1 & 2 great while learning the lessons of the earlier game & in the process did something I have never seen in a game: make an NPC the lead character...The game is set in 1912, in a cloud city called Columbia, which is another beautiful setting to play out the story, with a clever rail system you can travel along & dive-bomb onto enemies or gun them down from the rail. Either way, you can become death from above & is a brilliant addition & makes Columbia feel like it is in the air. And yes, you can fall to your death. Or make an enemy fall to their death. Great fun.The guns are period weapons, & like all Bioshock games, they can be upgraded for bigger clips, reduced recoil, bigger hitting power etc, but unlike Bioshock 1, the guns dont change appearances. Previously, guns have gained mechaincal devices that are doing the job of the upgrade. It feels like a step backwards, but it's a small gripe & one of the few I can find. Ammo can become scarce for certain weapons as you go through the game, but as before, there are vending machines dishing out health & ammo, so if you have the money, you can keep your guns stocked.You also have Vigours; abilities that let you shoot electric bots or fireballs, or even flocks of deadly crows. You need Salt to 'power' these & is picked up or purchased like ammo. Known as Plasmids in Bioshock 1 & 2. They give great tactical flexibility, you can use them or not, the game leaves it up to you. The variety is nice & I found I used all the different Vigours more often than Plasmids, although I did stick to combos that worked with the type of weapons I choose.The plot is layered really nicely. If you just want to shoot stuff, then there is a fairly simple ""get this girl & bring her back"" plot to enjoy, with a fairly relentless & fanatical antagonist (Comstock) pursuing you. However, delve deeper & there are ideas & commentaries on equality, racism, revolutionaries, religion, fanaticism, science, morality & even time travel. There are son many levels tp engage on & this helps to hide the fact that Bioshock Infinite is a pretty stright, linear FPS, no sandboxing here my friend, but this helps pacing so well that, trust me, you won't notice it at all. On my second play through, even knowing the plot, I felt like I got more involved in the game as I know the characters & their stories.On the characters, there are the Letuce twins, who provide some comedic & satarical relief, hiding the fact they are actually important componetns of the story, Comtock; a fanatical, charismatic leader who after a few taunts at your character, you really want to beat. Your character, a guy called Booker De Witt & I should tell you, he is a complete a*rehole. In fact, 1st play through, I almost wanted him to end up the bad guy & get what he deserves! You character is pretty unlikable throughout, although he does develop into a better man towards the end, but he remains a perfect anti-hero because he never really becomes the hero. The other thing to say about Booker is that the story of Bishock Infintite is NOT primarily about him. Of course, he is a major character in the story, as is Comstock, but the story is about an NPC, the girl you are sent to Columbia to recover; Elizibeth.Elizabeth is one of my truly favourite things about Bioshock Infinite in that the decision to make her the main character & keep her with the player throughout was made early & stuck to relentlessly by Irrational Games. Even when it seemed impossible to make her work the way they wanted her too, Irrational stuck at it. And this tenacity makes Bioshock Infinite stand head & shoulders above all but a handfull of games, of any type.During combat, Elizabeth ducks out of the way, keeping out of the line of fire, but chucking you ammo, health & salt occasionally, but you can't rely on this all of the time as the supply varies throughout the game. Once the combat ends, she emerges safe & sound. Occasionally, when she's ahead of you, she is in enemy sight, but they ignore her but open fire instantly when you're spotted. Again, a slight flaw, but it happens on few occasions so is one I'm happy to forgive. This means, the rest of the time, she can make conversation with Booker, grow as a character & give the player a chance to invest in the story that unfolds around you both. She has a wonderful, stubborn niavity that is steady worn down through the game & she matures into a much 'older' version of herself, which is reflected as her clothes get damaged & torn, she cuts her hair & she picks up injuries at set pieces.For some reason, my first thought when I saw her was that she reminded me of Belle from Disney's Beuty & The Beast, both in her initial character, dress & hair syle, but it may just be me. Either way, Elizabeth is a fantastic innovation both as a character to grow, develop & revolve a plot around & as a technical acheviement of making her function properly through what is occasionally a frantic FPS.I mentioned Irrational learning lessons from the previous 2 Bioshock's & the biggest is how to end a plot, which is not finished by a boss fight & a cut-scene. There is a boss fight, a fairly tough one, but after that, there is about 20mins of 'game' left as you are taken through the plot, tying up all the strings that have been laid down into a fabulous bundle that left me really, really wanting more, but utterly satified all the same. There's no combat, very few choices the player needs to make, but I was so enthralled I barely noticed 1st time around. It was only when I reached the actual end, when the story was finally unravelled& revealled that I noticed I'd finished the FPS bit some time ago. It wasn't quite the ultimate hairs-standing-on-end, but a few stood up for me, even the second time around.Basically, if you like immersive, story driven games with good characters & a beautiful setting to play it all out in, then Bioshock Infinite is a game you absolutely MUST play, as it is one of the best. No argument. So go & buy it before it's too late, as there are rumours all 3 games are due to pulled from Steam.I cannot put into words how highly I recommend Bioshock Infinite.			"

There's a variety of powers and weapons for each person's skill set and like's-Dislike's. Without a doubt This deserves to be played and if you feel like you have the time and recources i highly recomend it and I can promise you one playthrough won't let you get everything possible. And the combat is unbeatabe when it comes to uniqueness and it allows air combat. All im trying to get at is that this game is phanomanal and i reccomend it highly if i had to give it a rating 9.5/10 only reason there's not the other .5/10 is beacuse i want to play it even longer.

												No game will ever affect me as much as BioShock Infinite did.After playing through the game three times (twice on Xbox 360 & once on PC) it still upsets me that Irrational signed over the series permanently.I'm going to keep this clean of any spoilers and say that this was a brilliant end to the revolution of the trilogy, and that Burial at Sea episodes One & Two are to be considered absolutely mandatory if you are to play this game properly.This game has been one of only a few games, that has brought me to tears on more than one occasion. I am as passionate about this series as any fanatic is about whatever they are obsessed with.BioShock will always have a special place in my life post of completing Infinite.I would recommend not only this game, but BioShock, BioShock 2 also.If you are thinking about buying this, do it, have fun, and pay attention.

Chances are, you already know this game has received an enormous, glittering pile of Game Of The Year awards.Infinite has intriguing characters, gorgeous visuals, thrilling combat, and a deliciously layered, twisty plot. My only complaints are the two-guns limit and the increased reliance on ironsights compared to the previous games, but, honestly? Those are silly nitpicks in an otherwise flawless experience.I honestly don't think I could have enjoyed this more.			"

												Okay. This is going to be an in-depth review of the game as a stand-alone game, and as a part of the series, divided by the various elements that make a game, well, you know, a game.Gameplay:As a Part of The Bioshock Series (assuming you have already played them):Seriously lacking. They replaced the Power To The People Station with simple and cheap ways of weapon upgrades, which is, as a part of the series, a dissapointment. They replaced the plasmids with vigors which are frankly awesome, but not THAT new. What was new was the introduction to traps, which was very well handled. But what I cannot forgive is that they took away the ADAM gathering, and moved away its upgrades to simple vending machines, giving the game a much easier experience, apart from the serie's particular difficulty. 8/10As a Stand-Alone Game:Different, innovating, thrilling and rewarding, not to mention hard. Vigors kept the experience fresh, and the guns were well balanced. Good work. 9/10StorylineAs a part of the Bioshock Series: Good enough. It provided new and fresh ideas, but keeping the feel of being a Bioshock game. The unfolding of the story trough voxophones is brilliant, and, as compared to the stories in previous games, much, much more coherent and entertaining. 9/10As a Stand-Alone game:An absolute Masterpiece. Mind-blowing, exciting and amazing in every way. The characters are beautiful, the voice-acting is tremendously well done, and, not to spoiler anything, an ending worth crying for. 10/10Other elements:Animation: Perfect in every way. Very well done. Way better than the series (due to the fact that most of the main character in previous installments had little to no screen time) 9/10Soundtrack: Very well put toghether as actual parts of the storyline. 9/10DLC's: Absolute must haves. (Maybe Clash In the Clouds not as much) but the Burial at Sea series are definetly worth getting. ESPECIALLY if you played both previous Bioshock games. They may have their own reviews later on.Graphics/art: The art, as it's common among the Bioshock games is absolutely, amazingly beautiful. Therefore, the graphics are really, really good. 10/10Overall:As a part of the Bioshock Series: 8.5/10.    The gameplay changes were a serious letdown.As a Stand Alone Game: 9.7/10			"

												It was definitly worth the wait for this game to be released. Although i had a big graphical bug when this game got released which somehow got patched up recently . All i can say is the story is great. The characters are awesome ... just prepare yourself for a seriously mind blowing adventure. ""Live , Lived, Has Lived. Die , Died , has Died"" 10/10			"

												Oh. My. God. This game. There are not enough words to describe in such a MAGNIFICENT game in such a short recommendation. First and foremost, one of the most beatiful, most emotional, and active story lines EVER in a game. I would recommend it just based on that. But no! It gets better. The combat is INNOVATIVE, FUN, and does NOT get boring. Although unlike the original bioshocks, you can only carry 2 weapons at once. The vigors (plasmids) are fun, but I usually only stuck to one or two myself. Finally, the characters. My god. The characters. So engaging, so entertaining, and they make you feel so connected to them. One of the best games of 2013, one of the best games ever. Do NOT, I repeat, no NOT be the one to miss out on this game, this experience!			"

												Bioshock infinite is a game that I would recommend to those people searching for a game that has a really good story. the character development for each individual in the game was very good , it made the player feel closer to the characters. The gameplay was amazing, the use of different vigors to take out groups of enemies was definitely fun , combined with different variations of guns that would suit different play styles and strategies.I did encounter a bug once or twice during gameplay, it was not really a big deal but it♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me offENJOY THE GAME			"

 ""Booker, are you afraid of God?""""No, I'm afraid of you."" Disclaimer: While I don't talk about things that are major to the plot, I WILL talk about things that were revealed before the game was released.TL;DR: Overall, it's amazing. The story is great, but sometimes illogical and clichéd. The combat has been downgraded from BioShock 2, but it is still good enough that you can have fun for probably like 2 playthoughs(enough to see everything the game has to offer). Everything else is great, especially the sound.BioShock Infinite is the third installment to the BioShock series, and if you really look at it, it's BioShock 2. The real BioShock 2 is an expansion more than anything to BioShock 1. So, BioShock Infinite is as tradition, a story-driven narrative FPS game. It's been critically acclaimed and is considered the 'best FPS ever made', and I met a LOT of people calling it 'perfect'. A lot more than you would definitely expect. Then is BioShock Infinite that good? Not really. But that happens with games. And this game is still really really good.The game takes place in the flying city of Columbia. You are Booker DeWitt, a former Pinkerton and now a hired gun, sent to Columbia to rescue a girl trapped within the city in order to pay off a debt. The most interesting of all choices Irrational made with BioShock Infinite is that they implemented a talking protagonist- not just a talking protagonist, but there are backstories and plot-related things that are surrounding him. Ken Levin himself, the head writer for BioShock 1 and this game, said that making a talking protagonist was a LOT harder to write with then a silent one. So seeing that change was a bit surprising, but not that major since this game takes in a completely different but similar environment than the previous games.Columbia, in hindsight, is a beautiful city, but you'll quickly find out that the entire city is built on Nationalism(specifically on America) and Racism, and the city is a social commentary on these issues, and I enjoyed them. Though, the city is also built on religion, which at first was weird because BioShock 2 was a bit about religion, but Ken Levine was NOT involved in BioShock 2 whatsoever, so that can be accepted.But the entire game is actually in fact NOT about these philosophies. For some reason, folks at Irrational wanted to make BioShock Infinite about alternate dimensions. Huh. Weird approach, but I really liked it. Not very original, but they still somehow managed to fit it in with the world and the execution was great.So let's elaborate on these alternate dimensions. Elizabeth, the girl you have to save, has the power to open 'Tears', which is a doorway to another world. It works both in gameplay AND the plot; you can summon guns or cover and such from the other worlds to aid you in battle, or sometimes you'll just go to another world! Though you can't just make Tears out of thin air(the game say Elizabeth COULD, but now she can't).I won't talk about the story longer- but trust me, it's really good. I don't think it's as good as what people say, and I think it's not THAT original and clever, but the character interaction(which I can't talk about for long) and the writing itself really won me over. But... let's face it, in BioShock games; in ANY FPS games, you're going to be running around and shooting people. Then shoot people again. Watch a cutscene(not in this game though, there aren't that many cutscenes), and shoot some more people. At least, for 50% the time, you're going to be shooting people, not listening to characters talk. That's why the gameplay is so important, and this is where BioShock Infinite fails only a bit.First problem. You can only carry around two weapons. ...yes. There are NO explanations for this, even though in the previous BioShock games you could carry around 10 ♥♥♥♥ing guns at once, in this game, you can't do that. This really limits the tactical choices you can do in the combat because you can't predict the future. There'll be a point where you would say ""I wish I had this and this gun right now"", and that's not good. It prevents the player from having fun.There is also a lot of stuff they took out such as the Research Camera. Now I'll admit it, the Research Cameras in BioShock 1 and 2 were a broken mess gameplay-wise, but they still somehow worked and it fit right in the sci-fi heavy world that BioShock games have. They could have easily fixed it and put it into the game, put they decided it wasn't worth their time.This game also has some RPG elements with upgrades and such, which was present with BioShock even before it came out with System Shock. But the upgrades in Infinite are really dull and disappointing. You have your generic 'Damage Boost 1/2', 'Recoil Decrease', 'Reload Increase', etc. Really really dull. And I'm emphasizing this because BioShock 2 had great upgrades that were tied in with the Cameras. With the Rivet Gun, if you upgrade it fully, you can set people on fire! How cool is that! Not very useful admitibly in late-game, but still cool and it shows they put effort into it. Not in Infinite though.They HAVE implemented a brand new feature: Gears. You can get different kind of hats, shirts, pants and boots and they will give you passive upgrades to you, similar to Gene Tonics from the previous games. Unlike weapons, you can switch out Gears at ANY TIME. Wow. They did this with Gears but not weapons. I still don't understand that... but anyways, the gears are actually pretty fun to use(unlike Gene Tonics) and it also heavily encourages exploration as they will be your prime rewards for exploring the world, and BioShock has always been about exploration.There are also not a lot of enemy types, and this one enemy called the 'Siren' is basically just a chore to fight in higher difficulties. While this is a thing with a LOT of FPSs, it still doesn't excuse it. What I DO like about the gameplay is just the rest of it: the guns overall feel satisfying, but the actual gun variety is also pretty small. And 'Vigors', which are basically Plasmids, has more of the same concept, but the execution is done MUCH better then Plasmids. But again, sadly, there are only a few Vigors in the game.One things I also really like are the Sky-Lines and the Freight Hooks. You can climb on to a Freight Hook and gain height advantage, or ride around in these semi-monorails and fling around and such, It's really fun to use and the Gears also encourage the players to use Sky-Lines since there are a lot of Sky-Line related Gears. There is also a 'Shield' mechanic in the game; not original and not very well executed. A lot of times it pops out of nowhere and ruins the immersion.Let's talk about some minor parts. The graphics are vastly improved, and the world is very colourful. But there are some parts that are reminiscent of the original horror-type environments of BioShock 1 and 2. The sound design is AMAZING. Occasionally, you will hear present-day Classic Rock songs converted into 1910s-type western-feel songs, and boy, they are amazing covers. They are definitely one of the best part in the entire frickin' game.I COULD'VE gone for another paragraph about the game's story(and how it sometimes doesn't make sense), but the writing is just great in general and the storytelling is also great that you should experience it yourself. I personally thought some parts didn't add up, and some parts are only explained in the DLC, and some parts are just clichéd, but overall it was great.Overall, BioShock Infinite is an amazing game. Definetely would have been GOTY if it wasn't for the best game ever made(GTA V, wink wink) that also came out in 2013. I urge you to grab ALL of the BioShock games, and grab the Season Pass for this game as it adds a story DLC that wraps the entire series up nicely. I give BioShock Infinite a 8.8/10, it's a must own for its fairly cheap price tag.			"

												When this was coming out, everyone was calling it Game of the Year, that is, until The Last of Us came out, an then GTA V came out. While I didn't play any of these two, I can definietely say that Bioshock Infinite deserves to be called Game of the Year.Many FPS games today are basically multiplayer with little to no single player campaign. This is not the case. This is a big, well-made singleplayer adventure set in the floating city of Columbia , in the year 1912. The story is told in a good way with all the cutscenes done in-game.Graphically, the game is stunning, the environment are beautiful and sometimes artistic and the lighting effects are amazing. The characters have a rather semi-realistic look, nut that doesn't mean the game is not serious. This is what this genre lacks in general: COLORS. It's really nice to see a living, more colorful areas instead of gray or brown. The animations were smooth and nice too.I really liked the music and all those radios etc. playing in the city. It really makes you feel like you're the part of the world. I really liked the voice acting as well. When it comes to gameplay... I loved it, and I'm not a great fan of first person shooters. You get to use a range of different weapons as well as several powers to use against your enemies. The combat is solid and works well. Aside from weapons and powers you can also use melee attacks with a Sky-Hook that also allows you to cling onto freight hooks and go along rails in the air which is awesome. There're other things to do aside from just going to your goal and killing those who oppose you. All throught the world you'll find audio files of different characters, which add some detail to the story, as well as small old-school videos and telescope to look into. Even upgrades for health, salts and shield are often well-hidden, so the game really wants you to explore more, instead of just going from point A to point B. The game took 11 hours to beat for me and I have found majority of collectibles, I still had some left. The game still was a little short in my standards. It was still REALLY worth it, especially for the price since I loved every second of it. I loved the presentation, I loved the gameplay, the powers, the characters. It is clearly a game where developers put EFFORT into it.I'll probably get the DLC and the previous games in the series because I just want more.

												One of the best stories ever told in videogame history, and one of the most elevate peaks in artistic direction ever reached by the industry. Too bad that the gameplay is not at the same level, in fact it has been simplified so much that it's several steps behind to the original Bioshock, which to date remains the most balanced fusion of deep narration and great FPS mechanics. Anyway Infinite compensates with plot and characters, and still remains a must play.About the DLCs...they made a mess. Completely. I won't even talk about the ""Clash in the Clouds"" one because the only thing that crap is good for is proving that the combat mechanics of Infinite are very, very poor. About Burial at Sea...aside from the fact that splitting the new story arc in two was a really, really bad idea, after playing them you will be amazed and about to scream ""MASTERPIECE"" out of the window at first, but then you'll realize that everything you just saw literally made no sense with the premises left by the main game. Which is a terrible pity. They wanted to go full circle with the first Bioshock installment and make a deep and dramatic conclusion, but they just rushed things too much and made a lot of mistakes. Too bad, really.At least they gave us the noir version of Elizabeth. Which really compensates a lot. Believe me.			"

												Buy. This. Game. Now....no seriously. I'll wait. Oh, you haven’t bought it yet? And you want a (average) review on it? Alright then, here it goes. This is a masterpiece. People are relating it to Half Life 2, and Uncharted based on how good it is. It currently holds a meta critic score of 96/100 which is almost unseen of. The graphics and visuals in this game are absolutely stunning. You can easily get lost in this game's atmosphere looking for money, looting every corner of every place you visit, listening to the conversations between NPCs, reading the extremely well-designed advertisements located on walls, posters etc... I can go on all day. The amount of love and craftsmanship that went into this excellent piece of work is jaw-dropping. If you have the chance play this game on Ultra Settings, the graphics are almost better than life, its that good. Take the time to look at the detail on your weapon, or a poster on a wall, and I assure you, you WILL NOT see any sort of distortion or pixels (except when zooming in with a sniper). That my friends, is how detailed the world is. The gameplay pretty decent honestly, but nothing to special. You have your standard FPS gameplay, shooting your weapons, blowing off enemies’ heads and what not, but also has its own twist. Similar to the old bioshock titles, you can equip and weapon in one hand while casting lightening spells at your enemies with the other, or perhaps sending a flock of crows to eat away at your enemies flesh as you gun him down. The story as you progress is very good. You start to form a relationship with the character Elizabeth as she aids you throughout the game (also her character design is awesome, like something out of a Pixar movie). Toward the end of Bioshock Infinite the story starts to go full circle. But without spoiling, I did scratch my head for a good 5 minutes toward the last 30 seconds of the game, trying to figure out what just happened. But once I figured this interestingly beautiful (in an odd way) ending, I was satisfied. Sadly thought this game took me about 8 hours to complete on Medium, which is quite decent. I also play a lot of FPS games so there wasn’t much challenge for me. But next time I get the chance I will be doing a Hard run, just to give myself a bit more of a challenge, and to relive the atmosphere.Turn off all the lights in your room, put on some high quality headphones, turn the graphics on Ultra (if you can), and strap in because Bioshock Infinite, is easily going to take hours of your life away, as you explore this beautiful and extremely detailed world. Bioshock Infinite easily earns a 9 / 10. "

												""Best Game Ever 2014"" is a FPS story based shooter. The story is exceptionally well and if you take your time it will become very immersive. The environments and graphics throughout the game are immersive and atmospheric. The game has a lot to take in at the start and becomes even better later on. Not spoiling anything but the ending was amazing, even to this day i am finding out more and more about the Bioshock universe. It is very detailed and will blow your mind.Gunplay and other game mechanics are solid and AI is not annoying.Best Game Ever 2014 gets a 10/10			"

												Throat-constrictingly intense combat to make you feel robust and savvy, art direction and atmosphere to overwhelm and astound you, a licensed soundtrack to die (a million million times) for, a cartoony doe-eyed sidekick throwing a tantrum for a million gamers' waifu status, and spectacle of a very high magnitude all do a wonderful job of making sure you never think hard enough to notice the story doesn't actually make a great deal of sense. An excellent game and worthy experience, but a greater, craftily clever ode to and excuse for Ken Levine's rusty toolkit.			"

												In total, I give this game a 9/10, here is why:PROS:- Amazing Storyline- Easy to understand controls- Amazing Scenery (even on the lowest setting)- Variety of weapons, and way to go about the levels- Freedom to move around a bit (None linear levels in a way)- Many characters that are easy to understand and keep track of- Good variety of missions- Really tests your moral: Do what is right if it hurts people? Do what is wrong if it means no one will get hurt?- Elizabeth's ally skillsCONS:- Not a large variety of enemy types- Random ammo locations and ammo drops makes it hard to keep the weapons you want- Over viscious enemies that will not give inBoth, depending on your preference:- Jumpscare (Only one, but you won't be expecting it :P )A bit of spoilers beliw, but the main spoiler is at the bottom, so you can rwad below, and not spoil the ending,     The game is about a Mr. Booker De Witt, the character the player plays as, arriving to a light house, where a letter claims that Booker De Witt must bring ""The Girl,"" in order to repay his debt. While exploring the lighthouse, he stumbles upon a chair that shoots him up into the sky, where he finds a floating city known as Columbia. There the people of the city seceeded from the U.S. due to Abraham Lincoln's Civil War, and became its own ""state."" There, the people worship George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin, and follow the prophet and leader of their city: Mr. Comstock. Booker, bewidered by the place he stumbled upon walks around, allowng the player to learn how to play the game and ue each vigor as a carnival is going on show casing the different abilities the player will be experiencing. Everywhere he looks he sees posters of Comstock, and posters saying how he is the greatest man ever, and other posters claiming to avoid the ""False Prophet,"" created to ""stray the lamb away."" One poster in particular claims that the ""False Prophet,"" has the letter ""AD"" engraved on his hand, at this point Booker raises his hand to show the player that ""AD"" is on his own hand. As you are walking through the street, a note is handed to you, telling the player to NOT get #77 when playing the raffel that the city is doing that day. Lo and Behold, when you go and play the raffel and win, you got #77. You are given a baseball bat, and a black woman and Irish man is dragged out onto the stage and the announcer tells the player to throw it at them as the couple begs them. Here the player learns that the town is racist. The player is given their first choice in the game, throw it at the couple or throw it at the announcer. [I chose to throw it at the announcer] The player raises his hand, where a police officer grabs his arm, and points out the ""AD,"" is on his hand. Instantly, people run, and you kill the police officer, stealing his gun, and the real game begins. You use the gun to shoot at the officer. The game progresses like this until you reach a tower, where you learn that the tower holds a girl hostage, Elizabeth. You free her, learn she can open tears (doors into other dimensions,) and that she is possibly the daughter of Comstock. The rest of the game is trying to find out who Elizabeth really is, and how to defeat Comstock and fix your life.      To begin, the storyline is amazing, and is constantly keeping me wanting more. While I played it on hard (for the first time,) I was constantly having a challenge and to me, that was fun. The characters developed nicely, evolving as the plot developed, which also fitted nicely into the journey your character was embarking on. However, while I say that, the main character seemed to not develope in character as in how the character percieved certain things or how the player reacted to certain events, it was always the same, a gritty ""I don't want to be here,"" attitude; while this may be part of his character, it did seem to get a bit repetative.     Guns sounded nice, and did what guns are supposed to do. kill enemies in a realistic way. Upgrades could be purchased for the weapons and I admit that I did purchase a lot of them, but it is entirely up to player to buy upgrades, not only for the guns but for vigors as well. Vigors are powerups that the characters can use giving him special abilities, my favorite being possession; I rarely used the others however, but again, it is up to the player. Enemy variety is low, all characters that look one way also have the same type of gun, but do not carry the same gear when you search their dead bodies. These enemies range from anything to enemies with simple weapons and barely any armor (the police in the beginning,) to extremely hard (the helpers.) I will admit though, I did enjoy fighting all enemies when they showed up.)     Elizabeth, the character probably most people are familiar with, is an amazing ally. Constantly finding ammo, salts (item to use vigor,) health and pointing out items in the room you can grab. Without her, the player would have a hard time fighting. Her facial expressions are nicely done, changing as the story progresses. She mad at you? She will show anger, and talk to you differently. She will throw things to you without speaking, and show the player her anger by facing away from the main character: Booker De Witt.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The ending to the game was not something I could expect, especially when you find out Elizabeth is your daughter. It really makes you think about how you treated her in the game, and all the stuff that happened to her. Bottom line, you sold her.			"

												Had this game on Ps3 when it came out, and found it very indulging in story to the point where I may have spent a bit too much time playing it over and over for a week straight. The gameplay is just your average FPS variant due to the combination of guns and special powers called vigors that work in a similar way to plasmids from the first 2 games. The story is a fairly average one until you get more towards the end of the game where it finally all hits you and mind****s the hell out of you, and I did thoroughly enjoy it. Whilst the twist may not have had the same impact as the first Bioshock's twist did, it still was pretty much unseen for the most part and is worthy of appreciation as much as the first game was.If you have played the first 2 games, I think you will really enjoy this one. In my personal opinion I would put it ahead of Bioshock 2, but behind the original Bioshock, yet still a game worthy of the hype it received. If you like to play games based on the gameplay, and you're looking for a very good FPS, this MIGHT fit the bill but I would recommend it far more for the immersive story, the connections that can be made to the old Bioshocks, and the refreshing colour tones it brings for most of the game. (Oh - And of course all the crazy fan theories people come up with).Very enjoyable and well worth the download. Personal verdict - 9.5/10.			"

												Wow, just wow. this is what you will feel like upon completing this game. This has to be one of my favorite games of all time. The story was gripping and exciting, filled with little things that one who has exposure to media, pop culture, and literature can pick up on rather quickly. The gameplay was extremely good as it was all done by player action, you did everything. No quick time events, or anything, so you end up feeling like a total bauss when you fight a huge horde of people. This game was phenomanal and is something everyone should experience. Out of 5 i would rate it a 5/5, and if you have a beefy computer, then this would be candy for your eyes.			"

												Okay. This is going to be an in-depth review of the game as a stand-alone game, and as a part of the series, divided by the various elements that make a game, well, you know, a game.Gameplay:As a Part of The Bioshock Series (assuming you have already played them):Seriously lacking. They replaced the Power To The People Station with simple and cheap ways of weapon upgrades, which is, as a part of the series, a dissapointment. They replaced the plasmids with vigors which are frankly awesome, but not THAT new. What was new was the introduction to traps, which was very well handled. But what I cannot forgive is that they took away the ADAM gathering, and moved away its upgrades to simple vending machines, giving the game a much easier experience, apart from the serie's particular difficulty. 8/10As a Stand-Alone Game:Different, innovating, thrilling and rewarding, not to mention hard. Vigors kept the experience fresh, and the guns were well balanced. Good work. 9/10StorylineAs a part of the Bioshock Series: Good enough. It provided new and fresh ideas, but keeping the feel of being a Bioshock game. The unfolding of the story trough voxophones is brilliant, and, as compared to the stories in previous games, much, much more coherent and entertaining. 9/10As a Stand-Alone game:An absolute Masterpiece. Mind-blowing, exciting and amazing in every way. The characters are beautiful, the voice-acting is tremendously well done, and, not to spoiler anything, an ending worth crying for. 10/10Other elements:Animation: Perfect in every way. Very well done. Way better than the series (due to the fact that most of the main character in previous installments had little to no screen time) 9/10Soundtrack: Very well put toghether as actual parts of the storyline. 9/10DLC's: Absolute must haves. (Maybe Clash In the Clouds not as much) but the Burial at Sea series are definetly worth getting. ESPECIALLY if you played both previous Bioshock games. They may have their own reviews later on.Graphics/art: The art, as it's common among the Bioshock games is absolutely, amazingly beautiful. Therefore, the graphics are really, really good. 10/10Overall:As a part of the Bioshock Series: 8.5/10.    The gameplay changes were a serious letdown.As a Stand Alone Game: 9.7/10			"

First and foremost, one of the most beatiful, most emotional, and active story lines EVER in a game. I would recommend it just based on that. But no! It gets better. The combat is INNOVATIVE, FUN, and does NOT get boring. Although unlike the original bioshocks, you can only carry 2 weapons at once. The vigors (plasmids) are fun, but I usually only stuck to one or two myself. Finally, the characters. My god. The characters. So engaging, so entertaining, and they make you feel so connected to them. One of the best games of 2013, one of the best games ever.

												The  third instalement of the Bioshock universe, the FPS classic. What was great about previous ones (story, gameplay, atmosphere, great universe, interesting characters) is also present in this third and last game in the franchise. The atmosphere here feels a little bit more ""vintage"" so to speak as the game takes place in the early 20th century. But that doesnt hurt the game at all (Unfortunetaly my favourite character A.R. from original isn't present... well sort of) I found the new setting rather refreshing and interesting and once again very creative. The DLC content is also great especially for those who suffer from nostalgia for the Rapture :). Same as the first game in the franchise this one also offers an interesting twist and story. What I find especially great is that your in-game ""companion"" - Elizabeth - who you are supposed to help doesn't get in you way as it is case with most games that want you to escort someone or safe someone. Here it is direct opposite and it sets an example of how to do this kind of stuff right as Elizabeth is quite helpful, usually scouting around for ammo when you need it during the combat as well as med packs, coins etc. She also has a useful ability that player can utilize. It is a great addition to already great gameplay basics that was laid down by its predecessors. This game great, definiteley buy, you won't regret spending your money on this one,  and I can guarantee that this will be one of those games that will be stuck in your memmory for a long long time as it offers a great gameplay and emersive story experience. 10/10			"

The story, the weapons, the enemies, all the aspects of the game just saomehow fit together in this game. It's a piece of art in my opinion. It 's worth the full price but it's often on sales and it'll save you over 50% if you get it then. Anyway, I highly recommend this game for any price.

												2 words. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game is probably one of the best games I have ever played. I have followed the Bioshock series since its creation and this game... This is just- I am at a loss of words for it. It brings the feels hard, makes you feel like a mutated badass in combat with the ""Vigors"" and it is so cinematic it is as if you aren't playing a video game, it's as iff you are playing a movie. The art is over-the-top and the character development is amazing. My final rating? 10/10. If you are considering purchasing this game it is well worth the money.			"

												Irrational Games does it again. I never would have thought it possible to overshadow the first Bioshock, Game of the Year in 2007, but they found a way to do it. Amazingly fun gameplay and great fluid controls. Graphics are unbelievable and you can really see the emotion on Elizabeths face as she goes thru all the turmoil of being a caged prisoner to roaming the streets of Columbia and seeing the world for what it is. The story telling is incredible, with a lot of twists and things to make you scratch your head. The story comes to a beautiful and mind blowing close in only the way Ken Levine can create. I cannot recommend this game enough for anyone who wants to enjoy some FPS action with some great story telling, and really, really fun skyhook battles. 10/10 and my Game of the Year choice for 2013.

												A lot of the things i didn't like about the older BioShock games seem to be fixed very well here. The two-weapon restriction is far less annoying than in feared and works really well. As it suits itself for a BioShock game, the settings are absolutely astonishing, the combat intense, brutal and dramatic and the story is as always exploring the extremes of sociological corruption.I am very pleased with Infinite, especially the last part of the game was astonishingly powerful, and the ending was mind blowing.

												Bioshock Infinite is the third installment in the Bioshock series. It takes a dramatic change from the previous two as you are no longer in an underwater city. Instead you play as Booker in a city high up in the sky. The storyline is good and this is a good singleplayer game. There is no multiplayer action like as in Bioshock 2 but the game is worth it for the campaign. Wait for a sale before getting it as the game has been out a while.			"

												All of my yes. This is easily one of the greatest games I've had the pleasure of experiencing in years. Artistic style, setting, storytelling as well as the story itself, topics and their exploration, voice cast, writing, everything about this game is top-notch. I've heard complaints that the gameplay has been simplified from it's predecessors, but as someone who hasn't played them, I found it to be quite nice, and it suited the game well.The game certainly handles the companion thing incredibly well. They're never in the way or a nuissance, and very helpful, especially in firefights, where you really wouldn't notice her if she wasn't saving your life. The amount of detail put into her character while roaming or idling is extreme.From a technical standpoint, there are some minor yet glaring graphical errors (horribly stretched/skewed/misaligned textures, occasionally glitchy speculars, primarily) but nothing too noticeable. There are quite a few clipping issues throughout where you can get stuck on invisible solids or edges which can be very annoying when moving urgently. Load times are short, and it also runs well on lower-end hardware.			"

												Great job Irrational Games. This is the kind of game I want. It's not perfect, the gameplay has some issues to fix, there are not reasons to use all the vigors for example (maybe they want you to choose what power you like), you can carry only two weapons at the same time or other little things like that (I think the gameplay works more than decently however), but all the other things are greatly done.The setting is brilliant in every feature, I like the design, the idea of the city in the sky is awesome. The most important thing is: Columbia is alive. It's a ""full"" city, with its spirit, its believes and its problems. They've done an intersting work with Elizabeth, she interacts a lot with the environment and with the player. She is helpful in battle and soo human in all the scene where she is involved, expecially in the little scene where she is alone with Booker (essentially with you). You feel her feelings.I don't wanna say anything about the story, I just say there are not many games with a plot and a narration of this level.In conclusion I really enjoy the game and it could become one of my favs.My final advice is: try it, love it.

												It's great, but heavily overrated.The gameplay is a bit of a letdown as it was repetitive, the emotional impact is also a bit of a letdown to when compared to the original, but it's heavy in story and even beating the whole game can leave out huge bits of information requiring looking up.In the original, fighting felt more like a natural purpose, as everyone in Rapture pretty much went insane, but as this one you're running from police and stuff it just doesn't have the same purpose of escape as the first/Despite that, this game has a two weapon limit for realism and to further make it a challange when deciding ranges, you will only have enough money to upgrade a few guns, so pick wisely.The vigors have a few flaws too, some of them greatly overpower others or become situational. The combat is tense on higher difficulties, but is a walk in the park on lower difficulty, but the secret 1998 mode is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to play; I don't think 1998 is a good word to describe it, its like playing Mario but you have 30 seconds, every enemy is a hammer brother and there's only 1 life.

												Bioshock Infinite is one of the most shocking games I've ever played; it's stunning graphics combined with intensive gamelplay matchup for a winning combination. While the storyline is somewhat linear, it's an FPS; what do you think will happen? The actual plot is quite intricate; I won't ruin it for you, but it isn't the ""hero meets and saves princess"" kind of thing. Instead, it comes with twists and turns, suprising the player with each move. Bioshock Infinite is a game that should DEFINITELY be bought!			"

You'll find plenty of awesome stuff that has to do with the story-line and, believe me, it's amazing.However the game is a bit on the short side, but it's still one of the best games out there.If you're looking for a mainly story driven game, you should buy this			"

												Bioshock Infinite is a perfect example of what a videogame must be. The storyline is fantastic and will keep you thinking about it for several days after you complete it. This game is set in a floating city above the clouds, so you cannot expect a dark and scary environment like the one found in Rapture.But that is largely compensated by the immersive plot and stunning graphics.It is very hard to speak about the plot without spoiling it, so I can only say that the whole story, up until its very end, is very intellectually rewarding.

												Bioshock Infinite, what a brilliant change of pace for the First Person Shooter genre. It seems this game could easily be a saving grace amongst the average dystopia brown and gunmetal gray shooters of this modern era we live in.In Bioshock Infinite, you play as Detective Booker DeWitt, who seems to owe some large debt to some very dangerous people. Booker is sent to Colombia, a city in the sky, to retrieve a girl, Elizabeth.In most of my reviews I'd say ""Now that we've gotten the basics out of the way,"" and get to the actual review, but the main point in Bioshock Infinite that truly made me flip my proverbial lid was the story plot. It was a glorious thrillride of emotional turmoil between Booker and Elizabeth, gunfights and brutal hookblade finishers that kept me interested until the very end, in which the game gloriously exploded into a-... Well, anything I say about that would spoil the ending.Another point I'd say I truly liked about this game, was that it was a true sequel to the original. Sure, it takes place in the same universe, but it's truly a completely different game. In Bioshock you could stuff your weapons into seemingly neverending orifices, but in Infinite, you can carry only two, and must rely on Elizabeth to keep you stocked on weapons, ammo, salts, and health. Elizabeth is a character of neverending personality who can sometimes be hard to understand, which is a shocker to me. Most support characters are simply blatant cookie cutter stereotypes who are easily predictable and quite boring. Infinite, however, does not follow this suit. If I DID have to complain about something, (which I do, that's why it's a review) I'd complain that there isn't a large variance in the gameplay. You fight guys with guns and the occasional mini-boss, BUT OH LOOK, NOW THESE ARE DIFFERENT GUYS WITH DIFFERENT GUNS, but the mini-bosses are kinda the same, as essentially so are the baddies. But please, don't mistake this as saying the game is repetitive, which it isn't, if you play on a decent difficulty instead of coasting through life on the Easy mode... Casuals...TL;DR: Bioshock Infinite is an amazing game in which the main point is the changing relationship between Elizabeth and Booker, though the gameplay may be A LITTLE repetitive, that does not mean it is bad. You cannot have too much of a good thing.			"

												I love and recommend this game, however, it is not as good as the big gaming websites/magazines claim it to be. I would definitely give it an 8/10 for story and gameplay, but this is nothing if not a Bioshock clone. It's Bioshock as you've NEVER seen it before, but Bioshock nonetheless. Also, it is crazy short! You can beat the game in under 10 hours. I don't know about you, but personally, a $60 game should at least give 30 hours of play. Anyway, other than those complaints it was crazy fun to play, so get it! (on sale)			"

												There's nothing positive I can say about this game that hasn't already been said better.  Overall it was interesting, weird, fun, and thoughtful.  The atmosphere was superb, the gameplay smooth, the voice acting top-notch, and the world was very well put together.  I found the game extremely linear, with some environments reused here and there when it made sense to do so.  It's linearity wasn't a bad thing; it had a story to tell and an open world wouldn't have facilitated that process.  Still, it was a shame there was this rich and gorgeous world floating there and the game ended before I felt like I'd really seen everything Columbia had to offer.  My one complaint, and one that is entirely my own fault, is that I'd been led to believe that finishing the game opened up a new game mode (1999), and that the story would continue there.  Instead 1999 mode is just the same game with a dash of extra difficulty, and I was sad my adventure with Elizabeth was over.  Oh, also, it annoyed me there was a scene in the trailer that doesn't even remotely happen in the game, which sucked because it was awesome.  :(Anyway, Bioshock: Infinite deserves all the praise it has received and more.  Absolutely splendid game.			"

												This game was probably the only bioshock in the series that i actually started playing and did not stop playing until i beat it.The gameplay is smooth and fun, the atmosphere is so detailed, and the theme is mature. The story will keep you interested specially with the small details that even from the first second to start playing the game you have to notice. Alot of effort has been put into this game and it clearly shows. Easily deserves its critical acclaim.Pros+Main protagonist actually has a personality/character compared to the first two Bioshock games+The buddy system with Elizabeth is a unique and fresh breath of air to the series+The setting and environment is nicely done - has a mixture of the dark atmosphere that BS1 had and a unique colorful vibrant atmosphere as well unique to the game+The DLC consists of two episodes which continues the storyline but with a twst and also contains a arena mode type of mini game allowing you to challenge yourself in combat+The story adds humor and dramatic story telling compared to the previous games+Voice acting is fantastic and goes well with the storytelling+Many key elements from the original Bioshock games come back both in the main game and in the DLCCons-In the main campaign you can only carry two weapons at a time however in the DLC you can carry as many like in Bioshock 1-Not many mini games in Infinite compared to Bioshock 1 except until episode 2 of Burial at Sea DLC-Difficulty in Bioshock Infinite gun game combat is easier than previous games			"

												I recently ( 2 days ago ) I bought the triple pack of Bioshocks. Once again I made a risk , one that AGAIN got compensated with a wonderful game ( I only played Bioshock infinite, now I am going to play the Bioshock 1 ).I finished the game in 2 days, and the first thing I want to say is that the game got me hooked on it , and it is really rare for me to get hooked on in a game and finish it so quickly.I will makee this analyze divided in some parts so yea.The Graphics: 80/100 - I started with the graphics because, as you can see by the specs of my computer I am not specialist in the subject, but , still playing in Very Low with the resolution on 1024x768 and with 40 fps , I found in Bioshock Infinite a completely GORGEOUS game.The Story 97/100 - FINALLY , a game in the XXI century that cared more about the story than the graphics, a story that at the first impression could look more complex , but when you reflex about it , its  a good written story and very appealing. I also would like to say that both Booker and Elizabeth make a beautyfull pair that works VERY WELLThe Sounds 90/100 - When i entered the church in the game, the sounds that I heard were awesome , and as soon as i heard those sounds i knew this game was going to be awesome I dont want to seem cocky , but one thing i think it misses here is a sort of multiplayer , this game could have a co-op , or a sort of Battling GroundSo , at the end my evaluation is 89/100			"

												Okay so I thought I'd update my review that I posted about 3 years ago now. Looking back at it, this game is really a master of pulling you into the gameworld and just engulfing you completely. The story might not ""click"" for some people but if it does, boy it does.The graphics are on a technical level not really something to write home about but I have to give big props to the art direction. No matter where you are or in which direction you look, this game screams personality and is just gorgeous all around. The gameplay didn't change too much from the first two Bioshock games. There's still the plasmids which are now called vigors and you still shoot enemies with guns. They did add something new called a Skyhook which adds a new dynamic to the game (Atleast in the areas where you have tracks for it). Let's get to the story. Without spoiling much, the story definitely is the highlight of this game. It starts off very strong and subconciously plants a lot of questions in your mind that you want answered. This leads to the player never really being bored. It kind off falls off for some time in the middle but it ends again with a big bang. Especially the two Burial At Sea episodes wrap up the whole series quite nicely. Top Voice acting performed by notable people like Troy Baker elevates it to something truly special. There are some people who don't like this game. I get why. The gameplay is sometimes wonky and if you only play games for gameplay, this might not be the best experience you can have. But if you want to experience a truly special world, this is exactly the game for you. I for myself, love it.There's nothing like it.			"

												Bioshock Infinite is the sequel to Bioshock and is easily one of my favorite games, and I've played a lot of games. The writing, art, and characters of Bioshock games are always outstandingly well done, but Infinite adds to this fact and expands the universe to a crazy scale. I highly recommend.  It will blow you're mind, and the DLC will make you feels.			"

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. I honestly don't like the combat too much, because I think there is way too much of it for such a story driven game, plus I suck at it. The story, though, is amazing. It doesn't make any sence at first but if you look back at everything closely you can see how it does.			"

 ""Booker, are you afraid of God?""""No, I'm afraid of you."" Disclaimer: While I don't talk about things that are major to the plot, I WILL talk about things that were revealed before the game was released.TL;DR: Overall, it's amazing. The story is great, but sometimes illogical and clichéd. The combat has been downgraded from BioShock 2, but it is still good enough that you can have fun for probably like 2 playthoughs(enough to see everything the game has to offer). Everything else is great, especially the sound.BioShock Infinite is the third installment to the BioShock series, and if you really look at it, it's BioShock 2. The real BioShock 2 is an expansion more than anything to BioShock 1. So, BioShock Infinite is as tradition, a story-driven narrative FPS game. It's been critically acclaimed and is considered the 'best FPS ever made', and I met a LOT of people calling it 'perfect'. A lot more than you would definitely expect. Then is BioShock Infinite that good? Not really. But that happens with games. And this game is still really really good.The game takes place in the flying city of Columbia. You are Booker DeWitt, a former Pinkerton and now a hired gun, sent to Columbia to rescue a girl trapped within the city in order to pay off a debt. The most interesting of all choices Irrational made with BioShock Infinite is that they implemented a talking protagonist- not just a talking protagonist, but there are backstories and plot-related things that are surrounding him. Ken Levin himself, the head writer for BioShock 1 and this game, said that making a talking protagonist was a LOT harder to write with then a silent one. So seeing that change was a bit surprising, but not that major since this game takes in a completely different but similar environment than the previous games.Columbia, in hindsight, is a beautiful city, but you'll quickly find out that the entire city is built on Nationalism(specifically on America) and Racism, and the city is a social commentary on these issues, and I enjoyed them. Though, the city is also built on religion, which at first was weird because BioShock 2 was a bit about religion, but Ken Levine was NOT involved in BioShock 2 whatsoever, so that can be accepted.But the entire game is actually in fact NOT about these philosophies. For some reason, folks at Irrational wanted to make BioShock Infinite about alternate dimensions. Huh. Weird approach, but I really liked it. Not very original, but they still somehow managed to fit it in with the world and the execution was great.So let's elaborate on these alternate dimensions. Elizabeth, the girl you have to save, has the power to open 'Tears', which is a doorway to another world. It works both in gameplay AND the plot; you can summon guns or cover and such from the other worlds to aid you in battle, or sometimes you'll just go to another world! Though you can't just make Tears out of thin air(the game say Elizabeth COULD, but now she can't).I won't talk about the story longer- but trust me, it's really good. I don't think it's as good as what people say, and I think it's not THAT original and clever, but the character interaction(which I can't talk about for long) and the writing itself really won me over. But... let's face it, in BioShock games; in ANY FPS games, you're going to be running around and shooting people. Then shoot people again. Watch a cutscene(not in this game though, there aren't that many cutscenes), and shoot some more people. At least, for 50% the time, you're going to be shooting people, not listening to characters talk. That's why the gameplay is so important, and this is where BioShock Infinite fails only a bit.First problem. You can only carry around two weapons. ...yes. There are NO explanations for this, even though in the previous BioShock games you could carry around 10 ♥♥♥♥ing guns at once, in this game, you can't do that. This really limits the tactical choices you can do in the combat because you can't predict the future. There'll be a point where you would say ""I wish I had this and this gun right now"", and that's not good. It prevents the player from having fun.There is also a lot of stuff they took out such as the Research Camera. Now I'll admit it, the Research Cameras in BioShock 1 and 2 were a broken mess gameplay-wise, but they still somehow worked and it fit right in the sci-fi heavy world that BioShock games have. They could have easily fixed it and put it into the game, put they decided it wasn't worth their time.This game also has some RPG elements with upgrades and such, which was present with BioShock even before it came out with System Shock. But the upgrades in Infinite are really dull and disappointing. You have your generic 'Damage Boost 1/2', 'Recoil Decrease', 'Reload Increase', etc. Really really dull. And I'm emphasizing this because BioShock 2 had great upgrades that were tied in with the Cameras. With the Rivet Gun, if you upgrade it fully, you can set people on fire! How cool is that! Not very useful admitibly in late-game, but still cool and it shows they put effort into it. Not in Infinite though.They HAVE implemented a brand new feature: Gears. You can get different kind of hats, shirts, pants and boots and they will give you passive upgrades to you, similar to Gene Tonics from the previous games. Unlike weapons, you can switch out Gears at ANY TIME. Wow. They did this with Gears but not weapons. I still don't understand that... but anyways, the gears are actually pretty fun to use(unlike Gene Tonics) and it also heavily encourages exploration as they will be your prime rewards for exploring the world, and BioShock has always been about exploration.There are also not a lot of enemy types, and this one enemy called the 'Siren' is basically just a chore to fight in higher difficulties. While this is a thing with a LOT of FPSs, it still doesn't excuse it. What I DO like about the gameplay is just the rest of it: the guns overall feel satisfying, but the actual gun variety is also pretty small. And 'Vigors', which are basically Plasmids, has more of the same concept, but the execution is done MUCH better then Plasmids. But again, sadly, there are only a few Vigors in the game.One things I also really like are the Sky-Lines and the Freight Hooks. You can climb on to a Freight Hook and gain height advantage, or ride around in these semi-monorails and fling around and such, It's really fun to use and the Gears also encourage the players to use Sky-Lines since there are a lot of Sky-Line related Gears. There is also a 'Shield' mechanic in the game; not original and not very well executed. A lot of times it pops out of nowhere and ruins the immersion.Let's talk about some minor parts. The graphics are vastly improved, and the world is very colourful. But there are some parts that are reminiscent of the original horror-type environments of BioShock 1 and 2. The sound design is AMAZING. Occasionally, you will hear present-day Classic Rock songs converted into 1910s-type western-feel songs, and boy, they are amazing covers. They are definitely one of the best part in the entire frickin' game.I COULD'VE gone for another paragraph about the game's story(and how it sometimes doesn't make sense), but the writing is just great in general and the storytelling is also great that you should experience it yourself. I personally thought some parts didn't add up, and some parts are only explained in the DLC, and some parts are just clichéd, but overall it was great.Overall, BioShock Infinite is an amazing game. Definetely would have been GOTY if it wasn't for the best game ever made(GTA V, wink wink) that also came out in 2013. I urge you to grab ALL of the BioShock games, and grab the Season Pass for this game as it adds a story DLC that wraps the entire series up nicely. I give BioShock Infinite a 8.8/10, it's a must own for its fairly cheap price tag.			"

												When this was coming out, everyone was calling it Game of the Year, that is, until The Last of Us came out, an then GTA V came out. While I didn't play any of these two, I can definietely say that Bioshock Infinite deserves to be called Game of the Year.Many FPS games today are basically multiplayer with little to no single player campaign. This is not the case. This is a big, well-made singleplayer adventure set in the floating city of Columbia , in the year 1912. The story is told in a good way with all the cutscenes done in-game.Graphically, the game is stunning, the environment are beautiful and sometimes artistic and the lighting effects are amazing. The characters have a rather semi-realistic look, nut that doesn't mean the game is not serious. This is what this genre lacks in general: COLORS. It's really nice to see a living, more colorful areas instead of gray or brown. The animations were smooth and nice too.I really liked the music and all those radios etc. playing in the city. It really makes you feel like you're the part of the world. I really liked the voice acting as well. When it comes to gameplay... I loved it, and I'm not a great fan of first person shooters. You get to use a range of different weapons as well as several powers to use against your enemies. The combat is solid and works well. Aside from weapons and powers you can also use melee attacks with a Sky-Hook that also allows you to cling onto freight hooks and go along rails in the air which is awesome. There're other things to do aside from just going to your goal and killing those who oppose you. All throught the world you'll find audio files of different characters, which add some detail to the story, as well as small old-school videos and telescope to look into. Even upgrades for health, salts and shield are often well-hidden, so the game really wants you to explore more, instead of just going from point A to point B. The game took 11 hours to beat for me and I have found majority of collectibles, I still had some left. The game still was a little short in my standards. It was still REALLY worth it, especially for the price since I loved every second of it. I loved the presentation, I loved the gameplay, the powers, the characters. It is clearly a game where developers put EFFORT into it.I'll probably get the DLC and the previous games in the series because I just want more.

												Я влюбился в эту игру с самого начала самой серии!!!Как только я увидел био в стиме я не задумываясь его купил и сразу же сел за его прохождение,прошел,дальше вторая часть,прошел и ее. Боже,как я благодарен Кену за эти прекрасные две части полные мрака и боли.А дальше вышел инфинити,который я ждал хренову тучу времени.Правда меня разочаровало то,что действие происходило не в Восторге который понравился мне еще в первой и во второй части,но инфинит не подвел(в плане сюжета) Кен в своем стиле опять сделал мрачный и запутанный конец с которым я после прохождения разбирался в течении месяца,а то и двух. А потом я понял,может история био и Великого Кена подошла к концу,но такую игру ,а почему игру то? Все три части и + дополнения должны пройти все,на♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ на графон ,на♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥,что тебе не понравился он в плане шутора,на♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥,просто на♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. ТЫ ,ДА ТЫ,ИМЕННО ТЫ ДОЛЖЕН ПРОЙТИ ВСЕ. И насладиться этим,как насладился этим когда то я.И в заключении хочу сказать,что Круче игры я не встречал.Конец.Вдохновение закончилось,так бы еще написал.Ну теперь точно конец.Да точно.Ах да и еще кое-что ,потратить косарь не жалко,на такое уж точно не жалко.Если назовут донатером,забей болт,ведь у тебя будут эти три чудесные части.На ктоторые даже времени не жалко.И еще,друзья,я рыдал в конце инфинити)Ахах "

												Buy. This. Game. Now....no seriously. I'll wait. Oh, you haven’t bought it yet? And you want a (average) review on it? Alright then, here it goes. This is a masterpiece. People are relating it to Half Life 2, and Uncharted based on how good it is. It currently holds a meta critic score of 96/100 which is almost unseen of. The graphics and visuals in this game are absolutely stunning. You can easily get lost in this game's atmosphere looking for money, looting every corner of every place you visit, listening to the conversations between NPCs, reading the extremely well-designed advertisements located on walls, posters etc... I can go on all day. The amount of love and craftsmanship that went into this excellent piece of work is jaw-dropping. If you have the chance play this game on Ultra Settings, the graphics are almost better than life, its that good. Take the time to look at the detail on your weapon, or a poster on a wall, and I assure you, you WILL NOT see any sort of distortion or pixels (except when zooming in with a sniper). That my friends, is how detailed the world is. The gameplay pretty decent honestly, but nothing to special. You have your standard FPS gameplay, shooting your weapons, blowing off enemies’ heads and what not, but also has its own twist. Similar to the old bioshock titles, you can equip and weapon in one hand while casting lightening spells at your enemies with the other, or perhaps sending a flock of crows to eat away at your enemies flesh as you gun him down. The story as you progress is very good. You start to form a relationship with the character Elizabeth as she aids you throughout the game (also her character design is awesome, like something out of a Pixar movie). Toward the end of Bioshock Infinite the story starts to go full circle. But without spoiling, I did scratch my head for a good 5 minutes toward the last 30 seconds of the game, trying to figure out what just happened. But once I figured this interestingly beautiful (in an odd way) ending, I was satisfied. Sadly thought this game took me about 8 hours to complete on Medium, which is quite decent. I also play a lot of FPS games so there wasn’t much challenge for me. But next time I get the chance I will be doing a Hard run, just to give myself a bit more of a challenge, and to relive the atmosphere.Turn off all the lights in your room, put on some high quality headphones, turn the graphics on Ultra (if you can), and strap in because Bioshock Infinite, is easily going to take hours of your life away, as you explore this beautiful and extremely detailed world. Bioshock Infinite easily earns a 9 / 10. "

												It's been months since I've first played this game, and let me tell you. I am still absolutely awestricken by this game. THE GRAPHICS: Amazing, very smooth and nice to look at. THE ENVIRONMENT: Though it seems to be a happy and cheerful environment at first, the environment can really show its sick and twisted underbelly. Which is exactly this game's intention. The environment in this game really says a lot about it and is most like nothing you could have seen before.GAMEPLAY: Though it has very similar gameplay to its predecessors in the franchise, it has features that are not of the previous that make it fun and unique. The main part in this being the character, Elizibeth, who can bring new things into the area and help you with things such as HP and replenish your ammuntion.THE STORY: Man, the story on this game is absolutely a work of art. A masterpiece, if you will. It will always keep you guessing and is filled with twists and turns. With the Burial at Sea DLC it really ties all of it together.THE CHARACTERS: Arguably the best thing about this game is its characters. The characters work very well in their environment, are very dynamic, and can be very relatable. A man fallen on hard times, a girl hidden from the eyes of the world, or a few people who just want to have a sense of freedom.Another thing I say this game does greatly is give the main protagonist a personality. Whereas the main protagonist in  the first game, Jack, has no definate personality, Booker Dewitt has a very definate one. Some protagonists' personalities  don't work quite well with them, but with Booker, you really get a sense of what he's thinking and his goals in mind. He's a great character, well written, with a great and definate personality. Don't even get me started on Elizabeth, either. She's arguably one of the most dynamic characters I've ever seen.I figure I've spent enough time on this review. You want to know more about this game, you say? Buy it, it is worth every last cent.I rate this game 10/10. Has played, and will play, over, and over, and over, again.			"

												""Best Game Ever 2014"" is a FPS story based shooter. The story is exceptionally well and if you take your time it will become very immersive. The environments and graphics throughout the game are immersive and atmospheric. The game has a lot to take in at the start and becomes even better later on. Not spoiling anything but the ending was amazing, even to this day i am finding out more and more about the Bioshock universe. It is very detailed and will blow your mind.Gunplay and other game mechanics are solid and AI is not annoying.Best Game Ever 2014 gets a 10/10			"

												This is not a game. This is an experience. A piece of art. The level of thought and care that the developers put in the world is mindblowing. The story is probably the best story you will ever see in a video game ever.Its complex, and its absolutely perfect. The level of imersion is also insane, columbia is absolutely stunning, and Booker & Elizabeth are both remarkable, mature , and well thought out characters. I am not going to go into gameplay on this review, but know that it sure isn't the best part of the game, but i doesn't get in the way of the storytelling, atleas it didn't in my experience. Bioshock Infinite Sets a new bar for shooters. It shows that shooters can have very good story, while being enjoyable at the same time. I can't express how much i like this game with words only. Its a thing you need to experience yourself.Please, do me a favor, and buy this game. Please. I promise that if you like good stories, you won't regret it.			"

												Buy. This. Game. Now....no seriously. I'll wait. Oh, you haven’t bought it yet? And you want a (average) review on it? Alright then, here it goes. This is a masterpiece. People are relating it to Half Life 2, and Uncharted based on how good it is. It currently holds a meta critic score of 96/100 which is almost unseen of. The graphics and visuals in this game are absolutely stunning. You can easily get lost in this game's atmosphere looking for money, looting every corner of every place you visit, listening to the conversations between NPCs, reading the extremely well-designed advertisements located on walls, posters etc... I can go on all day. The amount of love and craftsmanship that went into this excellent piece of work is jaw-dropping. If you have the chance play this game on Ultra Settings, the graphics are almost better than life, its that good. Take the time to look at the detail on your weapon, or a poster on a wall, and I assure you, you WILL NOT see any sort of distortion or pixels (except when zooming in with a sniper). That my friends, is how detailed the world is. The gameplay pretty decent honestly, but nothing to special. You have your standard FPS gameplay, shooting your weapons, blowing off enemies’ heads and what not, but also has its own twist.

												Bioshock Infinite is a beautiful game with interesting characters and an engaging story that jumps the shark toward the end and lost my interest.The mechanics of the game do not live up to the aesthetic and story. The gunplay is very average. Some guns have some nice kick and decent variety, but I never was extremely entertained by the combat. Also, the looting system left me searching every nook for lockpicks and money fearing that without the upgrades I'd get from these I'd be helpless in later combat. That distracted too much from the narrative and prevented me from truely enjoying the story to its fullest potential.The city is beautifully designed and creates a visual representation of the extreme contrast between the rich and the poor in the Guilded Age, the time following the American Civil War up to the early 1910s. Rich parts of town look bright and beautiful while the ghettos are run down and dark.The story and characters of Bioshock Infinite may be its greatest achievement after its art style. While the story kept me engaged for almost the whole game, the last few hours or so of the story became very odd. I was very disappointed, and I was hoping for a simpler resolution than the grand drama the last few hours became. Also, there are far too many plot twists. I started feeling like the game was trying to hard to draw itself out. Overall, the story is worth experiencing despite its flaws.While Bioshock Infinite's mechanics and ending detract from its engaging plot and aesthetic, Bioshock Infinite is still a brilliant narrative driven game that is a joy to experience.

The environment the developers have created is a ton of fun and really draws you into the mood and period the game is set in. The graphics are a perfect match and the game play is amazing.

												Bioshock Infinite seems, at first glance, to be a rather significant departure from the norm in this series: where Rapture was worn down and decaying, your first view of Columbia is of a radiant and lively city (in the clouds).Thematically, however, it is just as ambitious as the first Bioshock, and has more than a few parallels to it.In terms of story, it excels: one of my favorite narratives in games, and I do not give that praise lightly.In terms of game mechanics, it doesn't deviate that much from the tried and true Bioshock formula. In fact, one of the few problems that I found with it is that it oversimplifies it: gear (which substitutes tonics) is nothing but an afterthought in normal difficulty and, barring a few places, I found the game rather easy (and I'm no pro). It has, however, one of the finest implementations of sidekicks in FPS of all time: not only is Elizabeth actually helpful (I lost count of the times she offered my health or ammo just when I needed it), but she is a interesting, developed character. Hell, it might be argued that she, and not you, is the main character of the game.Also, great, great, great music, and more related to the plot that it may appear at first glance.So, short version: great game, excepcional story, a bit easy, game mechanics needlessly simplified. Not a perfect game, but a game that you really should play, even if FPS are not your favorite genre.			"

												There is really nothing I can say about this game that hasn't been said already.  This is by far one of the best games I've played in many years.  From the storyline to the gameplay, this is a winner.  It keeps you interested all the way through, and once you finally get 1999 Mode, the action becomes something truly incredible.  If you havn't bought this, or say it hasn't lived up to the hype...play it, or play it again.  Its a masterpiece in gaming, and one owes it to themselves to at least try it, to at least experience the beginning.Edit: I keep thinking over my original review, and I feel I should kinda make it, you know, a proper review, and give the goods with the bads.  I'm a little bit biased, as I LOVE this game, and would go as far as to say it's one of, if not the best video game that has come out since the golden age of gaming.  Yes, that's a bold statement, but I think I can back it up.First of all, I should state what isn't so good: the combat.  I just got the dlc, and honestly, I hadn't played in a little while, so I was rusty.  Slowly but surely, I started to notice that even though it was fun to play and shoot stuff, it didn't have the impact so many other games like it have.  A lot of people don't like gore, but really, it's here to stay.  Many gorier games have combat that's just plain gut-wrenching, where you literally feel the bullets fly out of your fun.  This game doesn't have that as much, and with the storyline it has got, the combat shouldnt only look viseral, it should sound and feel viseral too.  I can say that's my only complaint, and it isn't much of one either, as it's still fun to play, just not as good as could be hoped. Now, to what I bypassed in the original review: the attention to detail.  The world of Infinite is a living, breathing society.  It has relatable characters, even in it's villains, (cough cough like Andrew Ryan cough) and an incredible vision of this world.  The future songs reverted to the music of years past.  The scenes of the future, and the confusion of these from the protagonist.  The ruddy landscape, like heaven itself, gleaming down upon you!  This game, in terms of what it sometimes doesn't say, and in terms of how the makers of it worked, is damn near perfect.  I've never just not wanted the game to end, and afterwards, not even want a sequel to it, as it couldn't even compare to it's predecessor.  If you haven't played this game, please...would you kindly pay the money, and pay attention to what isn't said in this masterpiece?  Don't just play the game: with mouse or controller in hand, live it.  That's the only way to appreciate it fully.			"

												THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BIOSHOCK INFINITE DLC, BURIAL AT SEA EPISODE 2. THIS IS NOT A REVIEW OF BIOSHOCK INFINITE. This is without a doubt the best DLC I've ever played. I liked Burial at Sea Episode 2 more than BioShock Infinite itself. Maybe the reason why I enjoyed this so much is because I'm a huge fan of the original BioShock, but at the same time I really liked Elizabeth's character and the way she interacted with characters from the original game. The Schrodinger's Cat stuff is still present due to this being an expansion of BioShock Infinite's story. This doesn't really bother me, though, seeing as the story is presented in a way where the player can actually take a moment to digest everything that's been happening - as opposed to BioShock Infinite. I'm not into the whole multiple dimensions thing, but if I absolutely had to have a story with it - this is how I'd want it done. Pros- Stealth combat that feels fresh after BioShock and BioShock Infinite's manic gunplay.- A plot that isn't as hard to swallow as BioShock Infinite's.- Great atmosphere - fans of the original BioShock will love it.- A couple new vigors/plasmids are introduced for the first time.- A great wrap-up to BioShock Infinite and a fantastic prequel for the original BioShock.- Sheds light on a few previously unseen areas and factoids of Rapture.Cons- The plot can seem kind of far out sometimes.- Plot holes, depending on how hard you want to look.- The Peeping Tom plasmid can kind of break the game's stealth mechanics. - The fact that the game tries to push you into playing stealthily as opposed to all guns blazing.- Going back to Colombia.- I wish it were longer!Overall, this is an amazing DLC that is definitely worth the admission fee. If you liked the first BioShock and didn't care too much for Infinite, this is basically a love letter to you from Irrational Games. Would you kindly kick back and enjoy your return to Rapture?			"

												Alright then. First run review. Will update at end of game.After playing Bioshock 1 & 2 previous to this game I was a bit taken aback as the usual underwater confined space environment had changed greatly to a more open air less intimidating environment, as I am still at the starting stages I can't go into to much more detail. The initial loading(using a elevator form) to start the story backbone hasn't changed much and still gets the needed info down.So far so good. I'll be back later with more details till then 8/10 worth it's weight.Edit: Alright Review v2.I've now made some interesting progress but have to admit to a bit of a sin now xD this game has made me stay up till 5am in the middle of the working week! with this achievement done story is rated at, at least 8-9/10.Game play: Usual RPG FPS good at most parts, something that does spice it up a bit is the ""tear"", where you ask Elizabeth to pull an object/open a hole in the TimeSpace etc. Now I'm going to spare the theories behind all that but the concept and usage seem to have been implemented well :).Rating 8/10.EDIT: Review v.3 final endgame.Right so before we get started I got something to admit. I came into this game thinking the with a bit of a snooze of this type of combat so normal difficulty caused me to miss the defence a bit in the final battle. That said.Le Usuals: Game play good very interactive, bit buggy on getting that bird to target sometimes with keyboard and mouse, attempted with controller similar issues. GFX: Bit bright at times but I guess that is the effect, setup on first run well worth it. Story:........Right so for le kiddies I gotta kinda star some of this out but lets give a moment just to say thank you Irrational Games! Right now... excuse my less intellegent version... It was a rightous skullf**k. I won't go into detail as that would absolutely destroy the point of experiencing it but wow thinking it over a few times really gives me the chills :) at the same time completely destructive effect. My brain hurts for over thinking the details but deffinately a story worth telling over and over. Wow.Again thanks to Irrational Games for the solid mindf*** you just gave me.Final Rating 9/10 Worth its weight in MUR! HAHAHAHA *pop*			"

												Bioshock Infinite is an amazing game. In this instalment, you play as Booker DeWitt, an ex-Pinkerton who travels to the floating city Columbia in search of a girl.Similar to the other Bioshock games, this is a single player story driven FPS. Along with the typical run and gun controls, you're given various powers along with a sky-hook which allows for fast paced rail platforming.The art direction and narrative are well done, however I don't think it quite lives up to first Bioshock as I personally preferred Rapture's atmosphere. The combat is a bit too easy as well.A mind blowing, visually stunning thrillride! There's absolutely zero reason not to give this game a shot. In my opinion it's the strongest contender for Game of the Year title			"

												It's been months since I've first played this game, and let me tell you. I am still absolutely awestricken by this game. THE GRAPHICS: Amazing, very smooth and nice to look at. THE ENVIRONMENT: Though it seems to be a happy and cheerful environment at first, the environment can really show its sick and twisted underbelly. Which is exactly this game's intention. The environment in this game really says a lot about it and is most like nothing you could have seen before.GAMEPLAY: Though it has very similar gameplay to its predecessors in the franchise, it has features that are not of the previous that make it fun and unique. The main part in this being the character, Elizibeth, who can bring new things into the area and help you with things such as HP and replenish your ammuntion.THE STORY: Man, the story on this game is absolutely a work of art. A masterpiece, if you will. It will always keep you guessing and is filled with twists and turns. With the Burial at Sea DLC it really ties all of it together.THE CHARACTERS: Arguably the best thing about this game is its characters. The characters work very well in their environment, are very dynamic, and can be very relatable. A man fallen on hard times, a girl hidden from the eyes of the world, or a few people who just want to have a sense of freedom.Another thing I say this game does greatly is give the main protagonist a personality. Whereas the main protagonist in  the first game, Jack, has no definate personality, Booker Dewitt has a very definate one. Some protagonists' personalities  don't work quite well with them, but with Booker, you really get a sense of what he's thinking and his goals in mind. He's a great character, well written, with a great and definate personality. Don't even get me started on Elizabeth, either. She's arguably one of the most dynamic characters I've ever seen.I figure I've spent enough time on this review. You want to know more about this game, you say? Buy it, it is worth every last cent.I rate this game 10/10. Has played, and will play, over, and over, and over, again.			"

												BioShock Infinite is definitely my favorite game of all times. The  first thing you will see when playing the game is that the visuals are really amazing (they were already amazing on XBOX360, so imagine how good they are on PC). On top of that, the soundtrack fits the game perfectly. The combat gameplay is really fun. The different vigors are really fun to use and experiment with on different enemies. Plus, Elizabeth being able to bring supplies and allies (such as turrets) through tears is a great gameplay element. Finally, the plot in this game is one of the best ever, but no spoilers here. The bottom line is: this is a wonderful game, and you should go buy it right now!			"

												This is a game that meets standards that nearly no other game can even make comparison to. A game that engulfs you in it's environment  making you feel and see, what the protagonist would. This game changes my expectations for what standard upcoming ones should be held up to compared to this. You may ask why, my reason being this is the greatest game I have ever played. It's just that good of a game to me. I would happily suffer a severe concussion if it would make me forget all about it, thereby allowing me to play it for the first time again, because the first experienced playthrough of this game, is like no other in the world. Thus hurting me emotionally,  physically, and drowning my mind with Infinite. 10/10			"

												All of my yes. This is easily one of the greatest games I've had the pleasure of experiencing in years. Artistic style, setting, storytelling as well as the story itself, topics and their exploration, voice cast, writing, everything about this game is top-notch. I've heard complaints that the gameplay has been simplified from it's predecessors, but as someone who hasn't played them, I found it to be quite nice, and it suited the game well.The game certainly handles the companion thing incredibly well. They're never in the way or a nuissance, and very helpful, especially in firefights, where you really wouldn't notice her if she wasn't saving your life. The amount of detail put into her character while roaming or idling is extreme.From a technical standpoint, there are some minor yet glaring graphical errors (horribly stretched/skewed/misaligned textures, occasionally glitchy speculars, primarily) but nothing too noticeable. There are quite a few clipping issues throughout where you can get stuck on invisible solids or edges which can be very annoying when moving urgently. Load times are short, and it also runs well on lower-end hardware.			"

												Bioshock Infinite is the third installment in the Bioshock series. It takes a dramatic change from the previous two as you are no longer in an underwater city. Instead you play as Booker in a city high up in the sky. The storyline is good and this is a good singleplayer game. There is no multiplayer action like as in Bioshock 2 but the game is worth it for the campaign. Wait for a sale before getting it as the game has been out a while.			"

												Completed it in 18.6 hours on hard, almost a full investigation of all areas since it seems I missed 4 voxophones (aka audio diaries). Very deep and involving plot, to really appreciate the ending, you must search for all of the voxophones to really get a feel for the world they have created. A little too much exposition at the end though, which can be quite jarring if were just blazing through the game. I'd be lying if I said I didn't tear up.Also, make sure you watch the credits. Halfway through you see a video of the voice actors sing a song in the game, once that's over, keep waiting until the veeery end.Elizabeth is one of the strongest female characters in a game I've seen, in the sense of good characterisation. She's not weak enough to be damsel in distress (technically, she's invulnerable to damage anyway, no annoying escort quests here) aside from one section of the game which is both creepy but downright depressing. The tears she creates make her extremely useful, as well as those little moments when she find you money, health, ammo and salts. By creating this pseudo-interaction with her, you really begin to grow attached to her. also, she tends to point out interesting things like hidden lockpicks and whatnot. Her reactions to you vary throughout the game, and her posture reflects this.Boss battles don't really exist, just large enemies, but you'll grow to hate them. Handymen especially are the worst, I died around fifteen times in one battle until I found the trick to beat them. The same with 'another' boss who I will not name.Overall, a must play. There are no mulitple endings apparently, though some may disagree. Saying any more would spoil the game :)			"

												There's nothing positive I can say about this game that hasn't already been said better.  Overall it was interesting, weird, fun, and thoughtful.  The atmosphere was superb, the gameplay smooth, the voice acting top-notch, and the world was very well put together.  I found the game extremely linear, with some environments reused here and there when it made sense to do so.  It's linearity wasn't a bad thing; it had a story to tell and an open world wouldn't have facilitated that process.  Still, it was a shame there was this rich and gorgeous world floating there and the game ended before I felt like I'd really seen everything Columbia had to offer.  My one complaint, and one that is entirely my own fault, is that I'd been led to believe that finishing the game opened up a new game mode (1999), and that the story would continue there.  Instead 1999 mode is just the same game with a dash of extra difficulty, and I was sad my adventure with Elizabeth was over.  Oh, also, it annoyed me there was a scene in the trailer that doesn't even remotely happen in the game, which sucked because it was awesome.  :(Anyway, Bioshock: Infinite deserves all the praise it has received and more.  Absolutely splendid game.			"

However Bioshock is a truly great game and might have topped the list in most other years. The environment the developers have created is a ton of fun and really draws you into the mood and period the game is set in. The graphics are a perfect match and the game play is amazing.

												There is very little I want to say about the game to draw you in that hasn't been already said, but it's one of those games that'll stay with you a long time after you've finished it.As an experience, it ranks among those from Homestuck, Fate/stay night, Spec Ops: The Line, and anything in between which blows your ♥♥♥♥ing mind with its buildup.Play this game, and when you're done come talk to me about it. We'll have lots to discuss.			"

Everything about the game is well made and true to the art of all things game design. I will continue to play and this looks like a 9/10. Would definitely recommend playing this and the first.			"

												Indeed, this video game speaks to me. I believe that the symbolism of Booker attempting to find his daughter is a perfect example of everyday life and attempting to fullfil our goals. I must say, Booker's enthusiasm is quite admirable.On the whole a very pleasing episode! and I can't wait for more!Jack Morgan﻿			"

twitter - @verticalspriteBioshock Burial At Sea Part 2Many games these days play it safe, not veering from the popular or well worn. Burial At Sea part 2 not only provides unique and mature content, but shows how DLC can be just as significant as the main game.When Burial At Sea Episode 1 ended it was possible to feel slightly let down. The content was of good quality but no real risks were taken. Episode 2 mixes up the gameplay, gives us the chance to play as Elizabeth and in the process tie up loose ends regarding Rapture and Columbia.Although the story follows on from Burial At Sea episode 1 you could be wondering why, as Elisabeth, you wake up in Paris with an opening set piece that's very similar to Infinite's. Walking down the street you see a beautifully crafted world, with locals greeting you in French and going about their day to day business. But Elisabeth doesn't stay in this wonderland for long. Before you know it you are back in Rapture and trying to rescue Sally. It wont be easy though, Sally is being held as ransom by Atlas, who is more calculating and sinister as ever.  Being a veteran player of the Bioshock games wont help you here. The gameplay is significantly changed from everything gone before. Elisabeth is weaker not able to open tears or see past doors thus limiting what she can do. Realising early on she wont win in a gun battle Elisabeth relies on her wits and outsmarting the enemy. You can kill or take down splicers but it's a slower and more tense experience. Its essentially a stealth and explore game, forcing you to duck, hide and stay out of sight while collecting scraps of information, trying to meet Atlas's demands. You know the task at hand is never as easy as its first made out to be but seeing the twists and turns of several storylines unravel in front of you is fantastic.Playing as Elisabeth is genuinely a new experience making you look at levels differently and adapt your play style to match your gear. Certain sections aren't dissimilar to challenge style rooms forcing you to think on your feet and cover all angles of attack. If your spotted you wont be fighting your way out of it. Laying traps and using stun darts tactically are the order of the day almost forcing you to be more absorbed in Raptures world as you play at a different pace. If you ever wondered how Elisabeth picked those locks, then it's answered here in the form of a mini-game where you can either get a noisemaking dart to aid you or set off an alarm which alerts nearby splicers. Its not complicated, simply being a test of reflexes but its better then simply needing enough lock picks to proceed.  Burial At Sea episode 2 doesn't have that much backtracking although the main portion of the game takes place in a ""hub"" of sorts giving you freedom to roam as you see fit. Follow the story and you will see most of what this DLC has to offer, yet even with the game basically telling you to explore and discover its still possible to miss that door code via audio log or that nod towards previous games hidden in a corner. Just by chance opening a door which was almost missed and not  part of any objective, led to a whole new area with upgrades and supplies. Another time curiosity may reward you with one of the biggest jump scares in recent times, almost seeming like Bioshock is saying ""told you so"".  Out of all of Bioshocks content on offer Burial At Sea part 2 nails the atmosphere perfectly. There are many areas of Rapture that are beyond eerie, and being forced to take your time due to your abilities only heightens the tension. Some very limited assets are re-used but they never seem shoehorned it to simply lengthen the DLC. Everything on offer here is present for a reason making Burial At Sea as powerful as any of the main Bioshock games.Episode 1 was very generic in its approach to Rapture giving you only a hand full of tools and a style of play seen many times. Episode 2 does not make the same mistake. There are a very few minor missteps like re-spawning enemies from time to time or the odd difficulty spike. You have plenty of weapons at your disposal to fall back on but the slower stealth mechanics of Elisabeth makes sense and it forces you to play differently. Also seeing parts of Rapture that easily surpass that of anything offered in Bioshock 1 or 2 was a huge welcome, being able to observe the relationship between Big Daddy and Little Sister evolve  or realising the ties between Rapture and Columbia go way deeper then ever thought possible, Burial At Sea Episode 2 is worth the season pass asking price alone. Clocking in at over 3 hours this DLC a massive fan service to both Infinite and the original Bioshock games that no-one should miss.Phenomenal PlotEerie AtmosphereTies up loose endsFitting Conclusion5/5 "

Posted: October 3, 2015
												When I first played this game back in 2013 I bought all the hype and thought it was a perfect masterpiece and all that crap. Over the next while I slowly started to see its flaws and began resenting it for being so overrated compared to some games that I believed to be far better. Until the point that I pretty much hated it just because it got too much praise.I recently replayed it and I'm somewhere in between those things now. It's definitely a good overall game with some very compelling qualities, but it's not the same game that MetaCritic will tell you it is.The combat is in no way tactically demanding, but it's fast-paced and satisfying. If I could use one word to describe it, I would probably call it very ""juicy"" (shut up Whitely). Some examples of straightup bad game design are handymen, the pathfinding feature, the final fight's level design, and above all else the decision to limit the player to two guns. I seriously will never understand that...Presentation is completely stunning, I don't think anyone can argue that. The models, textures, animations, effects, and especially the lighting build powerful atmosphere even when the story falls flat at times. The score, voice acting, and sound design help as well.But the thing everyone talks about is the story, which is where I actually have the biggest problem. It's ridiculously full of itself. In fact I don't think there's another game as laughably pretentious as this one.The relationship between Booker and Elizabeth is sooo clunky (with scattered exceptions), the ending is poorly delivered (while nobly ambitious), and the side characters are completely boring.Despite its flaws that people seemed to completely overlook at launch, I do think that everyone should play this game. If nothing else because it tried. It deserves to be recognized as something special, as an example of a company who was brave enough to go outside the comfort box of the FPS industry.			"

The level of imersion is also insane, columbia is absolutely stunning, and Booker & Elizabeth are both remarkable, mature , and well thought out characters. I am not going to go into gameplay on this review, but know that it sure isn't the best part of the game, but i doesn't get in the way of the storytelling, atleas it didn't in my experience. Bioshock Infinite Sets a new bar for shooters. It shows that shooters can have very good story, while being enjoyable at the same time. I can't express how much i like this game with words only.

The gameplay is good but not great. Where this game really REALLY excels is in the plot. When everything finally enfolds and is revealed, your jaw will hit the floor. The last one hour might be overwhelming for some with all the mysteries/questions answered and revealed and of couse, a plot twist. You might have to go online and find an explanation for the ending of this game because it is seriously complex.When you do understand it though, you will understand why countless people have love for this game. 9/10, probably one of the best games of 2013, no♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

This was a game that had character and I genuinely felt hatred towards the antagonists. Also, the way they expressed Elizabeth's emotions and the way she felt through dialogue was perfect.The best thing about this game however is the ending. The whole rest of the game is just a giant volcano, buliding up and up until the ending blows your mind with astonishment.Last thing, the only problems I felt with the game is that the gameplay was slightly lacking, besides that, I give it a 9/10.

												The end is just SO awesome! Even after the 30th time not less spectacular ... who has not played this game, missed one of the best stories that can be experienced. Guys, buy this game! Even 10 times, even if you dont like it (but this will certainly not happen). Support such manufacturers for more such fantastic, epic, genius games.Bioshock Infinite is beyond what my eyes could ever had imagined. My love for this game has no words... I just cant describe it. Its beautiful, its indescribable. Long Live Ken Levine and the rest of the Irattional Games Team. My Love for you guys is Infinite! <3			"

												I haven't played Bioshock 2 so I can only compare my experiences to the first game, and I'm happy to say that I had a much better experience than I did with the first game.The story is a time-travel / alt universe story that plays out pretty well I think, and I think one of the reasons it plays out so well because the devs put quite a bit of work into making the aesthetic and setting of the game really add to the story.  A lot of environments are pretty impressive and genuinely pleasing to behold, and I definitely took my time to appreciate quite a few of them.  The setting feels pretty well set out and character personalities feel right and topics such as racism and religion are well integrated and dont feel shoehorned in at all.  Elizabeth as second -main- character who has personality and importance to the story also adds a lot to the game, and gives the game a much better sense of reality than BS1 or other FPS games I have played do where side characters die off or don't have much depth to them.In some ways the weakest part of the game was probably the gameplay itself.  Guns and powers and their related upgrades feel a bit lacking in 'oomph' and there just a bit too many of them, and the game presents only a few enemies with the same powers you have.  There is quite a bit of combat in the game, a topic which I have seen other players complain about, but it didn't seem too excessive compared to other main-genre FPS games I have played, and it was at the least MUCH better than the combat in BS1.  The skyrail platforming works for quick movement and elevation-changing but just feels a bit too awkward in combat.  All that being said, I don't feel like the gameplay was a detriment or a displeasure at all.  It's just not amazing, and theres nothing wrong with that.The setting isn't without its flaws either, although minor.  For real, there needs to be more guard rails since falling off the city would be a huge hazard.  I don't have any problems with the story, I liked it as is without much need to contend with any details despite one or two specific points I am a little perplexed on.  On principle I don't like the mechanic of delivering the story in voicemail recordings, as I feel like its a little bit too much of a modern throwaway mechanic to give the player a digestable plot, but that's how it is these days and the story was good enough that I didn't mind it either.The game ran well with everything set on High / Very High.  Although fraps gave my FPS to be about 30-45 most of the time, my rig isn't amazing and the game never stuttered or felt like it was performing badly.Overall, I enjoyed the game a lot, much more than my usual FPS experience.   I'd reccommend the game, and would like to thank the person who gifted it to me.  I had fun.I haven't played the DLC but it has been reccommended to me.  I'll update this review when I get the chance to play it.			"

												Bioshock Infinite far surpassed my expectations. While it is immediately apparent that it's the most visually stunning game of all time, to direct similar praise to the game itself takes a while longer. But at this point I can say with confidence that this is, BY FAR, the best single player FPS game of all time, standing far above the likes of Call of Duty and Half-Life. It's also worth noting that I never bothered finishing the first two games, but this one just keeps getting better and better.			"

The writing, art, and characters of Bioshock games are always outstandingly well done, but Infinite adds to this fact and expands the universe to a crazy scale. I highly recommend.

												I recently ( 2 days ago ) I bought the triple pack of Bioshocks. Once again I made a risk , one that AGAIN got compensated with a wonderful game ( I only played Bioshock infinite, now I am going to play the Bioshock 1 ).I finished the game in 2 days, and the first thing I want to say is that the game got me hooked on it , and it is really rare for me to get hooked on in a game and finish it so quickly.I will makee this analyze divided in some parts so yea.The Graphics: 80/100 - I started with the graphics because, as you can see by the specs of my computer I am not specialist in the subject, but , still playing in Very Low with the resolution on 1024x768 and with 40 fps , I found in Bioshock Infinite a completely GORGEOUS game.The Story 97/100 - FINALLY , a game in the XXI century that cared more about the story than the graphics, a story that at the first impression could look more complex , but when you reflex about it , its  a good written story and very appealing. I also would like to say that both Booker and Elizabeth make a beautyfull pair that works VERY WELLThe Sounds 90/100 - When i entered the church in the game, the sounds that I heard were awesome , and as soon as i heard those sounds i knew this game was going to be awesome I dont want to seem cocky , but one thing i think it misses here is a sort of multiplayer , this game could have a co-op , or a sort of Battling GroundSo , at the end my evaluation is 89/100			"

												What a glorious Eton Mess of a game! Sloppily assembled, gorgeously presented and honed to a razor finish with a story that doesn't coalesce until the last line of dialogue is uttered - Infinite is a movie masquerading as a game, peppered with interactive arenas and exploration, dressed as half homage to America and half damnation of the very same. Well worth the ~13 hours it takes to see through, but don't spend more than $40 on it.			"

												BioShock Infinite is definitely my favorite game of all times. The  first thing you will see when playing the game is that the visuals are really amazing (they were already amazing on XBOX360, so imagine how good they are on PC). On top of that, the soundtrack fits the game perfectly. The combat gameplay is really fun. The different vigors are really fun to use and experiment with on different enemies. Plus, Elizabeth being able to bring supplies and allies (such as turrets) through tears is a great gameplay element. Finally, the plot in this game is one of the best ever, but no spoilers here. The bottom line is: this is a wonderful game, and you should go buy it right now!			"

												Okay so I thought I'd update my review that I posted about 3 years ago now. Looking back at it, this game is really a master of pulling you into the gameworld and just engulfing you completely. The story might not ""click"" for some people but if it does, boy it does.The graphics are on a technical level not really something to write home about but I have to give big props to the art direction. No matter where you are or in which direction you look, this game screams personality and is just gorgeous all around. The gameplay didn't change too much from the first two Bioshock games. There's still the plasmids which are now called vigors and you still shoot enemies with guns. They did add something new called a Skyhook which adds a new dynamic to the game (Atleast in the areas where you have tracks for it). Let's get to the story. Without spoiling much, the story definitely is the highlight of this game. It starts off very strong and subconciously plants a lot of questions in your mind that you want answered. This leads to the player never really being bored. It kind off falls off for some time in the middle but it ends again with a big bang. Especially the two Burial At Sea episodes wrap up the whole series quite nicely. Top Voice acting performed by notable people like Troy Baker elevates it to something truly special. There are some people who don't like this game. I get why. The gameplay is sometimes wonky and if you only play games for gameplay, this might not be the best experience you can have. But if you want to experience a truly special world, this is exactly the game for you. I for myself, love it.There's nothing like it.			"

												very good game with an amazing ending, as a story, the bioshock franchise stands above all, and infinite follows suit. It not only produces an amazing standalone game, but links the universe together without being cheesy and/or over complicated. Also the intricate character development makes the twist at the end even more devastating, although it could have been wrapped up quicker, that's the only thing i can see wrong with it plot-wise. As always the devs have created a utopiam/dystopian world depending on where you stand, the aesthetics are perfect and although the gameplay can feel repetitive at times, for the most part it's sound, also, the social and political allegorys may be obvious, but they are very effective.

The story is great, and it carries the game. Also, THE GRAPHICS. Yeah yeah they may not be as good as some of the newer ones, but they are still smokin hot.

												In order:1. Woah.2. Elizabeth.3. Hot Elizabeth. <34. Oh no! Elizabeth!!!5. Old Elizabeth.6. Hot Elizabeth.7. Baby Eliza..beth??8. Many Elizabeths.9. No more Elizabeth.0. Is that you, Eliza..beth?Game is all about Elizabeth <310/10 would Elizabeth again.Edit (2nd play through): Booker is so consumed with guilt that he developed a condition called Buttonphobia. This is clearly demonstrated in the game as he has the uncontrollable urge to slam his fist into every elevator button, in an attempt to smash it out of its metallic existence. I decided to replay the main game after getting the Season Pass on a sale, and also to complete some easy steam achievements that I've missed.Edit (Completed DLCs): The 2 Burial at Sea episodes really brings the story together. The plot is well written and matches seamlessly to BS1. I would say the combat in BAS episodes shies away from that of Infinite, especially the stealth approach in BAS2, and was really enjoyable for me.However, I am really disappointed in the lack of slamming of elevator buttons. Elizabeth did not honor her only friend (in her own words) by mimicking Booker's Buttonphobia. KappaAfter playing the entire Bioshock series, I can safely say these will remain my favourite games for a long while.			"

												To start, this is a great game and is defnintely worth your time and money.But first, I will state my only gripe with the game, which is the repetitive gameplay - but it is still fun - you just might need a small break and play through another game after progressing halfway through BI, then come back and finsh it.The presentation is amazing. The game looks great if you have the hardware to run it at high enough settings. The structures of the buildings, the designs of the vehicles, the character models, the music and ambient sound, and the dialogue all blend together to create a fantastic old-timey, early-1900's setting and enviornment that is mostly believable (it IS floating in the sky, though) and interesting to play through.The gameplay is solid. It is more or less a straightforward FPS. It's simple to play, and the game gives you enough tools to have a little variety in how you kill the bad guys. Again, it can get a bit repetitive, but nothing that feels like the Halo: Combat Evolved level ""The Library."" The story is fine. I liked the ending. Won't say too much to avoid spoilers. Defnitely buy the game, even if you decide to wait for a sale - it is better to play it eventually than not play it at all.Oh, and the controls are fine. I switched to a gamepad for the more relaxed feel, but K&M work just fine.			"

												Out of the two Bioshock games, Infinite has over thrown over the original Bioshock just by the skin of its teeth.(Yes I said two. That God awful game called Bioshock 2 does not count.) The thing that caught my attention immediately was the atmosphere and look of Infinite. It was an alien to the series, not just because it wasn't under water anymore but with the colors, the atmosphere and THE COLORS. The city of Rapture had a feeling of isolation and despair to its world. It had the colors of a dying rainbow, dont get me wrong I loved that about it. I thought that was a key feature for the series, but I was wrong. Columbia was a ""happier"" place to be in. It was bright, colorful and the old American feel to it was outstanding as well. Columbia was just a better world to roam around than Rapture. Because it has that open feel to it that the tubes of Rapture failed to  give, thus I found myself covering every inch of the world. A big factor I noticed in Infinite Vigors (Plasmids in the old Bioshock) was not an actual highlight to the story. There is no build up to it you just literally pick it up and drink it. That was an odd thing for me. Enough about the world time for the characters.Bioshock Infinte produced a handful of memorable character compared to the first one. Your character Booker Dewitt actually talks often so it just gives him more character than just another generic piece of meat that you control. He is further highlighted by his sidekick whom I think is the star of the game. Elizabeth the girl nextdoor type or rather the girl next to a cage(I laughed at my joke more than I should.). She's smart and has a lovely feel. It's an odd feeling to see someone so happy in a game that you actually feel happy for them. Play the game and you'll know what I mean. Sadly her character development was altered faster than expected maybe it was because of the things that happening in the story. I hoped for more dialogue between Dewitt and Elizabeth because it was charming and funny how they spoke to each other. The Lutece siblings were terrific. They added a depth to the pool of characters in the game. Maybe because they were british? A game is only as good as its gameplay and Infinite's gameplay is what won me over. The added sky line feature was a major touch to it. It just adds that momentum feel to it, rather than just running around, it different I can tell you that. The Vigors available in the game worked perfectly together and was fun to think of new combos that would destroy your enemies. Weapons were abundant but I just used 3-4. There is no more hacking in the game which for was a good thing. I was never really a fan of that. Now you just have to find lockpicks for Elizabeth to use. Oh and Elizabeth is an amazing sidekick. she is actually useful. The game is now a ""loot fest"" as you can pick up a lot of things for your health, vigor and ammo. You dont have health kits anymore you need to pick up a lot of things to regenerate your health(Which I like). The enemies are'nt that memorable because they're just normal people so you'll probably miss the good old splicers. It's still a solid FPS game. My finaly Verdict is that Bioshock is a soild 9/10 game. Now I say 8 because the story is an odd one. Not that I dont get it I played the game twice just to see that I actually got it being that Im an idiot. Sadly it feels that it tried so hard to shove the story down your throat. The last 25 minutes of the game is where all of it actually makes sense rather than just spread the story through out the game so that player would slowly ""decode"" it and form their own theories as they are playing the game so that the plot twist would have been a bigger shocker. Saddly it was not as good as the first Bioshock. It had way to much sub-plots that makes you lose sight of the main story. A shame really, if only the plots intertwined as good as I hoped them to be. non the less its a good game I recommend you buying it. Just wait for sales though I noticed that this game is almost free when it goes on sale so keep that in mind. or just buy the trilogy the down side is you'll get Bioshock 2. (Sorry for some of my grammar this is my first review and English is not my mother tounge.)			"

This is a long review so if you just want a brief summary of why I recommend BioShock Infinite then skip to Results and read from there.Irrational Games takes what 2K started did and pushes it above and beyond reality. One cannot come to words for how to describe BioShock Infinite as there are no words that possibly capture its essence. Story:As you sit in your little office you are given an offer, one that will allow you to be free of all that you owe. Two people, a man and a woman, provide you with an ultimatum with you accept. You are given the opportunity to go to a world in the clouds and retrieve a girl. As you push through your mission you will learn more about yourself than you ever wanted to know. Campaign:BioShock Infinite campaign is of decent length. Depending on the difficulty you chose and your play-style you get through this game from anywhere between 10-16 hours. I would recommend taking your time as this game is more about the story than the gameplay and missing the smallest element can result in a completely different understanding. The campaign is divvied up across 40-chapters, all varying in length, some take only a minute, while others you’ll be wondering for at-least an hour. An interesting element in Infinite is that almost all of the cinematics involve player interaction. You control basic camera elements, as well as in some scenes interaction with the environment. This provides a more immersive campaign than traditional games. Gameplay:BioShock Infinite does away with tonics, ADAM, and limited weapon upgrades. Instead of Plasmids you use Vigors, which are essentially the same thing with a different name. The only currency in the game is Silver Eagles, most likely based on the US Silver Dollar and Half-Dollar. You can use this money to buy weapon upgrades, Vigor upgrades, and ammo/health/salts. Unlike in the first two you no longer need to acquire Adam to get Vigor upgrades, which means you can customize your gameplay based on what you plan to use more. I was weapon intensive so I spent all my cash on weapon upgrades, and only upgraded on Vigor for the achievement. You also don’t buy Vigors instead you unlock them for free throughout the campaign which means you will have every single one by the end of the game. There are 14-weapons that you will find throughout the campaign: Sky-Hook, Broadsider Pistol, China Boom Shotgun, Triple R Machine Gun, Huntsman Carbine, Bird’s Eye Sniper Rifle, Paddywhacker Hand Cannon, Peppermill Crank Gun, Pig Flak Volley Gun, Heater, Burstgun, Repeater, and Hail Fire. So you won’t feel limited in this game by your weapon choice, as you have more than you can ever imagine. Although despite all these choices you can only ever carry two-weapons at one time. So you will more than likely stick to what you like, as you may not get it back for a while if you let it go. A new feature to the series is Infusions; infusions are vials found throughout the campaign that allow you to increase your health, shield, or salts (mana). Depending on your play-style you may find more or less of these throughout the campaign, but you will probably not find them all. Some are in secret areas, while others are right infront of your very eyes. Infusions allow you to customize yourself without limiting your capital.Results:BioShock Infinite is an amazingly beautiful game that is aweing and terrifying at the same time. Like all BioShocks you will enter confused and cautious, but as the game unfolds you will never want to put it down. The story is beautiful, the gameplay is fantastic, the music is breathtaking, and the environment is inspirational. As you play you will learn more about yourself that you can imagine through even the simplest choices, heads or tails?Pros:+Amazing story, amazing doesn’t even breach how brilliant it is.+Beautiful environment, you will stand there just to look at how beautiful the architecture is, how elegant the people are, how clean the world is.+Amazing music, the music is simple but rather still brings much depth to the game. Even the combat music draws shivers up your spine.+Great graphics engine, as well as a fantastic optimization tool. +Awesome boss battles, which keep you on your toesCons:-The enemies are kind of lacking (Most of them are the same enemy with a different gun)-The combat AI is rather limited, I found myself taking advantage of how stupid they were on many occasions.-They got rid of the manual saves (if you have a busy schedule you sometimes don’t have time to find a checkpoint).

												Summary: If you haven't purchased this game yet...DO IT NOWI think that very few words can truly describe the amazing game that is Bioshock Infinite. It is, by far, the best game FPS I have ever played! I could go on for hours telling you about all the things that make Infinite such a ridiculously amazing game, so I will leave the body of my review down below. I would recommend this game to everyone I know. I love the game, the world of Columbia, and I am most impressed with Infinite.Fluid game mechanics, excellent character development and a solid virtual environment all serve to transport the gamer into the world of Columbia. In contrast to the original two Bioshock games, Infinite maintains a more light-hearted and less stygian atmosphere throughout the game. The introduction of character-to-character interaction leads the user to understand the plot, goals, and underlying motives of each and every character.The NPC's of columbia stand out with unique personalities and attitudes during the game. They help the player comphrehend the attitudes of other game characters by presenting him/her with these multiple perspectives. For instance, the early NPC's of Columbia introduce topics, like the Vox Populi, which are not fully explained until halfway through the game. Some may argue that this is counterproductive, but I believe it holds some strategic merit. Oh, and the Lutece Twins, my favorite side characters from Infinite, are exceptional examples of how game characters can really connect to the player! After all, they ""are where [they] are needed and needed where [they] are""...			"

												After finishing the main story play of Bioshock Infinite I literally had to jump up out of my seat and splash cold water on my face.  The story took me through twists and turns and arcs, then led me to a conclusion that was not definitive in itself, but captivating in its possibility for multiple interpretations.  It reads like a Haruki Murakami novel, lavished with so many smoke and mirrors--while there is the impression of plot, one cannot be sure of its essence.  The combat is unique and challenging for a shooter.  The visuals are supreme.  The impressions of philosophy and quantum theory weaved throughout the tapestry of the game was excellent.  The development of the characters and break from standard morality and heroism is sublime.  One cannot help but fall in love with the characters.  The mirror the game atmosphere holds up to the inequities of society today and yesterday is heart-wrenching.  After playing, you might not know what's real or not in your life anymore.Basically this game is f*cking amazing.  Go get it and play it.  Get mind-f*cked and enjoy!			"

												It’s old, it’s been covered, the plot has been spoiled and the DLC produced, yet somehow I never got caught in the media blaze that was hailing Bioshock Infinite for being one of the best narratives in gaming. In fact, I actually managed to play it completely blind well over two years after it’s release in 2013. So here’s my verdict for this once near-idolized FPS RPG: Eh it’s a pretty good game I guess.I remember the ravings and the discussions over just how mind blowing the story was and how everyone just melted into an ooze of wonder when they hit the big plot twist, but it was just good. I think whoever wrote the story did a great job and I hope they were well commended for it, but the game on the whole was nothing revolutionary. The formula was refined but essentially handled like the other BioShock titles. The gunplay wasn’t weak but certainly didn’t carry much weight. The vigors even lacked depth; I found myself only ever really using the shock/fireball/charm vigors, and I only fired the shield and tentacle one just to say I tried. If there is anything to praise about BioShock Infinite, it’s Elizabeth. No not because her “story is so fantastic” and the narrative she delivers is “mind-bending”. Honestly, she could have had next to no involvement in the plot and I would have still been blown away simply for the fact that I did not hate every single action she took. I have not seen an AI companion in a game be this not-terrible since Half Life. Every game that ever wants to do AI companions or even escort missions needs to take a good hard look at how Elizabeth behaves both in and out of combat. She never gets stuck, never halts progression, never runs into a hail of bullets to find cover behind a nearby piece of paper, doesn’t require you to hold her hand through every single encounter and in fact reliably keeps you in relatively good shape during combat by tossing you ammo, health and salts.BioShock Infinite is alright, well worth picking it up on sale for 10 or 15 bucks, but in my mind the most amazing thing about it is that someone finally made an AI companion that wasn’t the absolute worst thing on the face of the earth.

												BIoshock Infinite... where to begin?The story of Bioshock is one that we all have come to love. The first game was memoriable not because of the new gameplay elements it introducted with plasma, but because the story was so gripping. I played that game in ONE SITTING because i was so into the game. It was one of the only games that i have every done that with. Bioshock 2 takes place 8 years after the first but left a hole in the plot and was almost a copy and paste version of the first.Now Bioshock Infinite comes out.Bioshock Infinite may not offer the newest shooting elements, nor will it win any awards for the multiplayer, but this game stands out as a TRUE sequel to the first Bioshock. The characters, the story, the enviroment, everything stands out just like it did in the first Bioshock. It starts with Booker DeWitt and he is searching for a woman named Elizabeth. The reasoning behind this is vague,cloudy and adds to the development of the story. ""Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt"". Columbia feels different than Rapture...yet strangely familiar. You will be impressed looking around just as you did with the first Bioshock.Columbia's world sucks you straight in and never let's up. I was surprised to see countless themes put into this new world. Racism, Social Class System, Socialism, War, Rebellion, Revolt, everything that was found in the early 20th Century.Some people might be turned off because of the ""religious"" theme that is found throughout the story, but believe me it does not turn the story off. i HIGHELY RECOMMEND that you search for all the VOXOPHONES to get the entire story of Bioshock Infinite.The graphics in Bioshock Infinite are right up there with some of the best and  current PC games. Whether it comes to a keyboard or a controller the controls are tight and responsive either way. Take the time to look around and see the detail and hidden secrets that the world of Columbia has to offer. This is probably my GOT for 2013.I look forward to the newest installment of Bioshock through DLC and maybe a sequel? Who Knows?10/10			"

												I can proudly say that this is the best game that I have in my library and I will be very surprised if I find something that I love more. Bioshock Infinite, the sequal of the hit 2008 game Bioshock (and no I don't count Bioshock 2 because of obviouse reasons), is a thrilling game that runs buttery smooth and offers an experience like no other, allowing the player to gun down enemies by the boat-load all the while flying through the sky via an easy-to-use grapple system (it involves a track and a thing on your arm that doubles as a tool and a weapon).Not only does the game look and play great, the charaters you meet along the way are very engaging and it'll be a long time before I forget any of them, especially an entertaining pair of ginger scientists. But most importantly, you will never grow tired of your companion Elizabeth, who will always provide you with intriguing dialogue and the unique ability of picking up useful items and throwing them to you, a mechanic that has saved my♥♥♥♥♥more than once.On the whole, this is a game that you need to play at least once in your life. With excellent writing, setting, characters and gameplay, Bioshock Infinite is deffinatly a game that leaves you satisfied yet perplexed when you see the ending credits roll.			"

												I recommend this game to completely everyone (just get the trilogy and play in sequence).The good points:StoryGameplay/ControlsAI (enemies are not particularily difficult, but the AI was smooth and polished, especially the Elizabeth's AI)The greatest point of this game is the story.The ending for this game was something I've not experienced in another video game. And I simply accepted it, sat through the credits thinking and putting it all together and it made perfectly enjoyable non-sense.I am not sure if reading a bit about quantum mechanics would increase the satisfaction of experiencing the story, or would just give you spoilers...or both (superposition if you know what i mean).P.S. If you can't digest any story other than: ""Hero X saves the Y"" then maybe you would also consider the ending as ""bad"". Constants and variables.			"

												I was unsure whether I would like this at first, as I haven't properly played a first person shooter game enough to get into the genre and the gameplay looked pretty standard to me from what I had seen. But when I started playing I immediately got invested in the world, story, characters, atmosphere and even the gameplay - which was the main thing I was unsure of. It blends all of these elements together so well to make one of my favourite games of 2013. The vigors are vastly different to one another and create a new spin on the gameplay and always keep it exciting, the guns also feel quite a bit different to each other, but I'd say the vigors and sky-rails make the gameplay much more interesting. The story is really interestingly told and thought provoking, especially the ending. Which should create a lot of discussion of views on the whole experience and different interpretations.Should you buy this game?Short answer: Yes.Long answer: Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees!

												This game is truly amazing. The visuals are beautful, the story pulls you in, the voice acting is perfect, the guns feel like they have real wieght to them (especially when you combine them with Vigors/Plasmids), and Elizabeth is the best companion you could ask for. She helps you thoughout the game by throwing you money and ammo and also by picking locks. You really feel like these are real people and are really doing what they're doing. The ending will give you chills.The DLC is even better. It connects this game to the first one by showing you the events that lead up to the fall of Rapture and also by answering many of the questons that the first Bioshock raised. In the DLC you dont get as much ammo and weapons that you get in the main game, and you need to use stealth in order to get by. Its just as dark and creepy as you remember.			"

												BioShock Infinite is a beautiful game, suffice it to say. It's a wonderfully crafted story that tackles so many different concepts, you'll wonder how they could have fit so much thinking in one game. Free will, betrayal, racism, religion, human life, faith, the unseen, and of course, interdimensional travel. I have lots to say about this game so I think I will break it up into a few different segments.Graphics-The graphics in BioShock Infinite are utterly gorgeous. There is no other way to put it. The artistic vision and realistic textures are blended together in a splendid way.Character Development-It is impossible not to become infatuated with Elizabeth when she first appears. Her naivete, her identity crisis, her piercing blue eyes... Simply wonderful, that one. Elizabeth is like something out of a Disney movie, with a bit of a dark side. Her commentary on Booker's actions is quite thought-provoking.Plot-I had to sit and think about it for a while. The only thing that got ""rekt"" here was my brain. A few of the concepts I latched onto quite easily, but I quickly dove into the trippy♥♥♥♥♥ending, and things became a lot more fuzzy. The amount of brain power it took to write and create such a great plot is Matrix-level impressive.Allusions/Commentary-The game takes on faith in a very interesting way. If anyone actually read those transition cards that the game shows with Booker's writing on loading screens, one of them mentions the power of peoples' beliefs, which is portrayed in a very amusing way in the game. Essentially, BioShock Infinite demonstrates that faith is a tool that can be used for good or for evil. I've read some reviews calling this game racist, and that is downright disappointing. Simply because a game portrays a society that supports racism does not mean it is a ""racist game."" That would be like calling George Orwell's ""1984"" a book that glorifies authoritarianism. Anyone who calls this game racist has blatantly misunderstood most of its messages. Racism is not glorified in any way, nor is religious extremism or murder. As for the clever references, props to 2K for all of their work! In fact, when  Elizabeth opens that tear to Paris, you can see the movie advertisement says ""Revanche du Jedi."" Does that suggest some kind of alternate universe where George Lucas made Jedis the villains of the Star wars Saga? Someone give me an answer in the comments.  All in all, Infinite is somewhat of a fairy tale for adults; a bit of a cross between Inception and Rapunzel. BioShock Infinite is quite possibly the most amazing game I have ever played. So, what are you waiting for? Buy it, beat it, and talk to me about it! Maybe we can swap theories sometime over a flask of Vigor.			"

												Very good sequel to a very good series of games. Bioshock Infinite is not the 10/10 a lot of people say it is. The combat is not as good, the characters not as well written and the atmosphere not as tense as Bioshock 1. But that does not make this a Bad Game. It is still a very good game with one of the best written storylines in any game ever. The conclusion to this will have you brains spinning for days on out. Play it if you have already played the other Bioshock games!			"

												I have played a good amount of first person shooters over the past couple of years and I can, without a doubt, say that this is my favorite. World: No game I have ever played feels as alive as this one. As soon as you reach Columbia you can tell it's a living, breathing, world. You can see pedestrians living their lives as if nothing will ever change. You can hear the conversations of people who are talking about the world around them. And the world of Columbia is beautiful, it's filled with color, music and life. Every couple of minutes there is a sight worthy of being put in a picture frame and hung up. World: 10/10Graphics: The world complements the visuals of the game itself. The graphics in this game aren't exactly ""realistic"" but they are beautiful in an artistic way. There are some very small areas that don't look too great though, such as the apples in a basket, which are just a flat texture. If you can max out this game I highly recommend you do, it will make your experience with this game even better. Graphics: 9.8/10Sound: Bioshock infinite chooses great sound to go with most situations. Whenever you get into a fight intense music is played to go along with it. If you cut off or shoot off an enemy's head or brutally murder an enemy it plays a sharp sound as if to say, ""That’s ♥♥♥♥ed up."" In the background you can hear music that really helps capture the 1900 feelling. The sound while just walking around or firing a weapon is also great. Sound 10/10.Gameplay: Most of the gameplay consists of fighting enemies. Although that doesn't sound too great, the game implements it in a way that is fun and refreshing compared to other shooters. You can ride on skylines and fight and the same time, making fighting very fast paced. While fighting, Elizabeth can help by throwing you some supplies such as ammo and health packs. This makes Elizabeth helpful and not annoying to have around. Gameplay 9.5/10Story: There is a huge mindf**k at the end and one day you will finally understand it… I’m sorry I didn’t explain much, the story is best experienced knowing nothing going in. Story: 10/10 This game permanently changed what I thought a video game could be. If I had to give it an overall rating I’d say 10/10. This isn’t just a videogame, this is a work of art.   BUY IT NOW!!! Average from 5 criteria: 9.86			"

												As you are probably aware 'Bioshock infinite' is part of the contemporary prequel fad. Therefore, like Deux EX: HR or Serious Sam: BFE it takes place before the events of the original game. Instead of being in Rapture, an underwater utopia gone wrong, you are up in the air, in the city of Columbia. A totally different environment from the dark claustrophobic post-apocaliptic feel of the original games. The idea is most welcome, having a huge open and sunny playground with skylines connecting different floating platforms sure sounds like fun. But ultimately the strategy element of the original games (using the elements of each room to your advantage) gives place to more classic arcade action battles and the enemies are less imaginative. You get to see the city shining and falling apart as you progress through the game and although it has great moments, the dissonance and dark humor are less present than before. If the combat and actual set pieces are definetly aimed at a wider audience, the convoluted storyline is more niche oriented and ambitious. The uprising of the masses and the multiverse deliver many twists that other FPS wouldn't. All in all a solid 20 hours of gameplay, a fun ride despite the lack of real challenges even in hard mode (I have yet to test 1999 mode). The final product seems a bit rushed to actually call it a masterpiece but it's a worthy addition to the series and I bet the DLC's in Rapture are grand!			"

												I haven't quite beaten the game yet, but I am pretty darn close, so I think it is appropriate to write a review. So, what makes this game a great game? Well, this game DOES things to a person. The music during battle that is played is eerie, and adds a whole new level of depth to whenever you are in a fight scene. The story is great, and it carries the game. Also, THE GRAPHICS. Yeah yeah they may not be as good as some of the newer ones, but they are still smokin hot. Like, they must have 11 protons because they are sodium fine (Get it anyone? Heh, heh, k). Overall it is a great game, but since I don't have any of the previous Bioshock games, I am unable to say that is is better than Bioshock 2.			"

Posted: September 15, 2015
												Out of the two Bioshock games, Infinite has over thrown over the original Bioshock just by the skin of its teeth.(Yes I said two. That God awful game called Bioshock 2 does not count.) The thing that caught my attention immediately was the atmosphere and look of Infinite. It was an alien to the series, not just because it wasn't under water anymore but with the colors, the atmosphere and THE COLORS. The city of Rapture had a feeling of isolation and despair to its world. It had the colors of a dying rainbow, dont get me wrong I loved that about it. I thought that was a key feature for the series, but I was wrong. Columbia was a ""happier"" place to be in. It was bright, colorful and the old American feel to it was outstanding as well. Columbia was just a better world to roam around than Rapture. Because it has that open feel to it that the tubes of Rapture failed to  give, thus I found myself covering every inch of the world. A big factor I noticed in Infinite Vigors (Plasmids in the old Bioshock) was not an actual highlight to the story. There is no build up to it you just literally pick it up and drink it. That was an odd thing for me. Enough about the world time for the characters.Bioshock Infinte produced a handful of memorable character compared to the first one. Your character Booker Dewitt actually talks often so it just gives him more character than just another generic piece of meat that you control. He is further highlighted by his sidekick whom I think is the star of the game. Elizabeth the girl nextdoor type or rather the girl next to a cage(I laughed at my joke more than I should.). She's smart and has a lovely feel. It's an odd feeling to see someone so happy in a game that you actually feel happy for them. Play the game and you'll know what I mean. Sadly her character development was altered faster than expected maybe it was because of the things that happening in the story. I hoped for more dialogue between Dewitt and Elizabeth because it was charming and funny how they spoke to each other. The Lutece siblings were terrific. They added a depth to the pool of characters in the game. Maybe because they were british? A game is only as good as its gameplay and Infinite's gameplay is what won me over. The added sky line feature was a major touch to it. It just adds that momentum feel to it, rather than just running around, it different I can tell you that. The Vigors available in the game worked perfectly together and was fun to think of new combos that would destroy your enemies. Weapons were abundant but I just used 3-4. There is no more hacking in the game which for was a good thing. I was never really a fan of that. Now you just have to find lockpicks for Elizabeth to use. Oh and Elizabeth is an amazing sidekick. she is actually useful. The game is now a ""loot fest"" as you can pick up a lot of things for your health, vigor and ammo. You dont have health kits anymore you need to pick up a lot of things to regenerate your health(Which I like). The enemies are'nt that memorable because they're just normal people so you'll probably miss the good old splicers. It's still a solid FPS game. My finaly Verdict is that Bioshock is a soild 9/10 game. Now I say 8 because the story is an odd one. Not that I dont get it I played the game twice just to see that I actually got it being that Im an idiot. Sadly it feels that it tried so hard to shove the story down your throat. The last 25 minutes of the game is where all of it actually makes sense rather than just spread the story through out the game so that player would slowly ""decode"" it and form their own theories as they are playing the game so that the plot twist would have been a bigger shocker. Saddly it was not as good as the first Bioshock. It had way to much sub-plots that makes you lose sight of the main story. A shame really, if only the plots intertwined as good as I hoped them to be. non the less its a good game I recommend you buying it. Just wait for sales though I noticed that this game is almost free when it goes on sale so keep that in mind. or just buy the trilogy the down side is you'll get Bioshock 2. (Sorry for some of my grammar this is my first review and English is not my mother tounge.)			"

This is a long review so if you just want a brief summary of why I recommend BioShock Infinite then skip to Results and read from there.Irrational Games takes what 2K started did and pushes it above and beyond reality. One cannot come to words for how to describe BioShock Infinite as there are no words that possibly capture its essence. Story:As you sit in your little office you are given an offer, one that will allow you to be free of all that you owe. Two people, a man and a woman, provide you with an ultimatum with you accept. You are given the opportunity to go to a world in the clouds and retrieve a girl. As you push through your mission you will learn more about yourself than you ever wanted to know. Campaign:BioShock Infinite campaign is of decent length. Depending on the difficulty you chose and your play-style you get through this game from anywhere between 10-16 hours. I would recommend taking your time as this game is more about the story than the gameplay and missing the smallest element can result in a completely different understanding. The campaign is divvied up across 40-chapters, all varying in length, some take only a minute, while others you’ll be wondering for at-least an hour. An interesting element in Infinite is that almost all of the cinematics involve player interaction. You control basic camera elements, as well as in some scenes interaction with the environment. This provides a more immersive campaign than traditional games. Gameplay:BioShock Infinite does away with tonics, ADAM, and limited weapon upgrades. Instead of Plasmids you use Vigors, which are essentially the same thing with a different name. The only currency in the game is Silver Eagles, most likely based on the US Silver Dollar and Half-Dollar. You can use this money to buy weapon upgrades, Vigor upgrades, and ammo/health/salts. Unlike in the first two you no longer need to acquire Adam to get Vigor upgrades, which means you can customize your gameplay based on what you plan to use more. I was weapon intensive so I spent all my cash on weapon upgrades, and only upgraded on Vigor for the achievement. You also don’t buy Vigors instead you unlock them for free throughout the campaign which means you will have every single one by the end of the game. There are 14-weapons that you will find throughout the campaign: Sky-Hook, Broadsider Pistol, China Boom Shotgun, Triple R Machine Gun, Huntsman Carbine, Bird’s Eye Sniper Rifle, Paddywhacker Hand Cannon, Peppermill Crank Gun, Pig Flak Volley Gun, Heater, Burstgun, Repeater, and Hail Fire. So you won’t feel limited in this game by your weapon choice, as you have more than you can ever imagine. Although despite all these choices you can only ever carry two-weapons at one time. So you will more than likely stick to what you like, as you may not get it back for a while if you let it go. A new feature to the series is Infusions; infusions are vials found throughout the campaign that allow you to increase your health, shield, or salts (mana). Depending on your play-style you may find more or less of these throughout the campaign, but you will probably not find them all. Some are in secret areas, while others are right infront of your very eyes. Infusions allow you to customize yourself without limiting your capital.Results:BioShock Infinite is an amazingly beautiful game that is aweing and terrifying at the same time. Like all BioShocks you will enter confused and cautious, but as the game unfolds you will never want to put it down. The story is beautiful, the gameplay is fantastic, the music is breathtaking, and the environment is inspirational. As you play you will learn more about yourself that you can imagine through even the simplest choices, heads or tails?Pros:+Amazing story, amazing doesn’t even breach how brilliant it is.+Beautiful environment, you will stand there just to look at how beautiful the architecture is, how elegant the people are, how clean the world is.+Amazing music, the music is simple but rather still brings much depth to the game. Even the combat music draws shivers up your spine.+Great graphics engine, as well as a fantastic optimization tool. +Awesome boss battles, which keep you on your toesCons:-The enemies are kind of lacking (Most of them are the same enemy with a different gun)-The combat AI is rather limited, I found myself taking advantage of how stupid they were on many occasions.-They got rid of the manual saves (if you have a busy schedule you sometimes don’t have time to find a checkpoint).

												Unlike so many other games, this is a story first and an action game second. The story is absolutely amazing, and Elizabeth is unlike any NPC I've ever seen. She's not a ball-and-chain to lug around, she's a character to meet and experience. I've never related with a video game character more than I've related with Elizabeth.This is an amazing game and Irrational has shown us again that they're great at wrapping a story in a video game. I'd highly recommend this. Unless something else blows me away this year to this magnitude (which I highly doubt), this is my GOTY.			"

												The sheer beauty about this game is the abject horror that exists in the colorful dreamy cloud city of Columbia. The notion that this is some kind of heaven for folk with the psychological hold it's master has on the populace, and how the denizens have wilfully given that control to him is a disturbing portrayal of how deep the rabbit hole goes when moral codes are twisted to the corrupt ends of corrupt minds. 10/10 gives me chills each time I think of it			"

												YES!!!! This was how Bioshock 1 &2 should have played!This game was fantastic! It was gorgeous as far as graphics are concerned, and it played smoother than any game i've gotten on steam. honestly, my compter is a bit of a potato by today's standars but aside from a small handful of bugs i didn't have any problems that turned me away from the game, or ruined the fun.The atmosphere is very different from the first two. It's still a looter shooter of course, but it REWARDS you for exploring and explore you will! The immersion, especially in the first few parts, is what gaming is all about. It isn't a horror game like you might consider the first two. In Fact, save for a desperate scramble to reconnect the plot to the series in the end like a high school freshman half assing a paper rambling off topic from his thesis a half an hour before class(Not that i'd know... cough*), it has nothing to do with the first two. It's creepy in some parts, but the dark and gritty horror environments generated in the first two just weren't implemented.The combat is SO MUCH SMOOTHER. There are actual stagger mechanics, and the guns don't feel like pea shooters. While there's still potential for difficulty, when you pick up a mini gun... YOU HAVE A MINIGUN. It makes heads explode like watermelons and it's too satisfying. The melee finishing moves are grisly, and add a little more fluidity than just beating splicers over the head with a drill. Upgrades come timely, and seem to be at apropriate costs and scales. You feel rewarded for saving up all those pennis you scavenged for and put into your carbine.The plot.... I can't defend.It started out wonderful, and you're just excited to be playing and on an adventure. Save the damsel in distress, escape and save the day after shooting out like a bandit. BUT that Hottie you and SHOULD be sipping champagne with in paris at the end turns out to be your daughter. And she drowns you. The end. It seems that bioshock does well with plot, UNTIL they try and make it deep. It only turns out convoluded, and in the end you're absolutely baffled at the uselessness of your ending. There are some major holes, and the ""rippin and the tearin!"" time travel/alternate reality thing. If bioshock makes another game, im going to make sure they dont kill you off yet AGAIN by your own daughter before i buy it. If plot is super important to you, you'll be disappointed.Got this game for 3 dolars in a bundle and i have to say, it was worth the cost of the bundle and made up for bioshock 1 and 2. I'll definitely play this through again, though the plot is absolutely annoying.Steam issues:I had virtually none with this game, which i could only kindd of scratch my head at. This is by far the most demanding game ive played as far as requirements go and i didnt half a tenth of the issues i normally get from games on steam, and were even present in the first two older games.i had a blast, and i think if you enjoy first person shooters and immersive experiences and SMOOTH GAMEPLAY, you wont be disappointed you bought this, but ecstatic.

												Bioshock Infinite is not your casual first person shooter. It's set in Columbia, in 1912, where you are Pinkerton agent called Booker Dewitt and your mission is to save Elizabeth who was imprisoned at her childhood. You must fight your way trough Columbia, using large scale of different guns, vigors and skylines. But the story doesen't end in rescuing Elizabeth, you also have to get her back to New York. Bioshock Infite has an amazing story with thrills and suprises, amazing and deep characters and deep emotional moments. After finishing the main story I can't wait to get my hands on the seasonpass. 5/5, Elizabeth is hot as ♥♥♥♥.			"

												I've always been particularly into dystopias, and I recently learned what a classy example of one Bioshock franchise is.The first game was purely awesome, though it did have some gameplay lacks and some incompleteness but the story and setting were totally deep and stunning.So, the same is with Bioshock Infinite. Its story, setting, art design (you bet!) left me absolutely marvelled. I mean, in what other game could you find quantum mechanics as the basis for the whole plot? This game made me seriously interested in this science and I actually went a bit crazy already dwelling on what we really are, how we are and ""why do you ask ""what"", when the delicious question is ""when""? The characters are also brilliant (Fink, Luteces, Slate) and I am certainly not the only one who fell in love with Elizabeth.But when it comes to gameplay, this game has some issues. For instance, the system of Vigors in my opinion is far from perfect. Having completed the game on PS3, I found with regret that some vigors I simply didn't need (that despite I was playing with gamepad without aim assist, so I was forced to use Vigors creatively). It is even worse with weapons, as many of them are virtually useless and would rather get you yourself killed than your enemies, and even upgrades are a slack argument for carrying them, especially as you can carry two pieces only, which I think is rather good and challenging. Besides, the whole gameplay could be less linear and repetitious. They could put those mechanical horses to use somehow, or add telekinesis, like in the first game. But no. Enjoy the great story between call-of-duty style shoot-outs with electromagnetic field in place of regenerating health. But as I have already stated, the story is so absolutely fantastic and overwhelming that I, for one, intend to play it over and over again countless number of times, discovering new details and building new theories about what actually is behind all of these ideas.Thank you, Ken levine. A must-have masterpiece, still there is nothing perfect.			"

												The sheer beauty about this game is the abject horror that exists in the colorful dreamy cloud city of Columbia. The notion that this is some kind of heaven for folk with the psychological hold it's master has on the populace, and how the denizens have wilfully given that control to him is a disturbing portrayal of how deep the rabbit hole goes when moral codes are twisted to the corrupt ends of corrupt minds. 10/10 gives me chills each time I think of it			"

												YES!!!! This was how Bioshock 1 &2 should have played!This game was fantastic! It was gorgeous as far as graphics are concerned, and it played smoother than any game i've gotten on steam. honestly, my compter is a bit of a potato by today's standars but aside from a small handful of bugs i didn't have any problems that turned me away from the game, or ruined the fun.The atmosphere is very different from the first two. It's still a looter shooter of course, but it REWARDS you for exploring and explore you will! The immersion, especially in the first few parts, is what gaming is all about. It isn't a horror game like you might consider the first two. In Fact, save for a desperate scramble to reconnect the plot to the series in the end like a high school freshman half assing a paper rambling off topic from his thesis a half an hour before class(Not that i'd know... cough*), it has nothing to do with the first two. It's creepy in some parts, but the dark and gritty horror environments generated in the first two just weren't implemented.The combat is SO MUCH SMOOTHER. There are actual stagger mechanics, and the guns don't feel like pea shooters. While there's still potential for difficulty, when you pick up a mini gun... YOU HAVE A MINIGUN. It makes heads explode like watermelons and it's too satisfying. The melee finishing moves are grisly, and add a little more fluidity than just beating splicers over the head with a drill. Upgrades come timely, and seem to be at apropriate costs and scales. You feel rewarded for saving up all those pennis you scavenged for and put into your carbine.The plot.... I can't defend.It started out wonderful, and you're just excited to be playing and on an adventure. Save the damsel in distress, escape and save the day after shooting out like a bandit. BUT that Hottie you and SHOULD be sipping champagne with in paris at the end turns out to be your daughter. And she drowns you. The end. It seems that bioshock does well with plot, UNTIL they try and make it deep. It only turns out convoluded, and in the end you're absolutely baffled at the uselessness of your ending. There are some major holes, and the ""rippin and the tearin!"" time travel/alternate reality thing. If bioshock makes another game, im going to make sure they dont kill you off yet AGAIN by your own daughter before i buy it. If plot is super important to you, you'll be disappointed.Got this game for 3 dolars in a bundle and i have to say, it was worth the cost of the bundle and made up for bioshock 1 and 2. I'll definitely play this through again, though the plot is absolutely annoying.Steam issues:I had virtually none with this game, which i could only kindd of scratch my head at. This is by far the most demanding game ive played as far as requirements go and i didnt half a tenth of the issues i normally get from games on steam, and were even present in the first two older games.i had a blast, and i think if you enjoy first person shooters and immersive experiences and SMOOTH GAMEPLAY, you wont be disappointed you bought this, but ecstatic.

												This will be a rare instance that I brand something my 'favorite'.  NO spoilers. TL;DR at the bottom. This story will break your brain, and make you cry. The writing in this game is phenomenal to a point that if you have never played this game before, you are doing yourself a discredit. Don't look it up, don't watch some autaud play it on youtube, just play it through for yourself. I personally promise you that it lives to all the hype and accolades it received when it came out in 2013. I haven't loved, like actually feel fuzzy for a game, a game since the original Bioshock (2 was ok). This being my second play through (first played on PS3) and the -SPOILER- still had a big impact on me. The world is gorgeous, and fun to explore, and each area feels distinct even though it's all in one big city. The set pieces are amazing, and I found myself just staring at stuff in game, admiring the super vibrant decor, posters, etc. Everything looks and feels alive. Visually and audibly, it's simply amazing. have I said that already? It's amazing.The core game play while fun and engaging, at points can border on tedium (it IS an fps after all). There aren't many enemy types, and for the most part are just squishy humans. Save for the 'Handymen', and the steampunk nightmare fuel that are the 'Patriots'. Luckily you get those nifty Vigors to spice things up. By that I mean, Setting dudes on fire. Or sending crows to peck their eyes out. Or any number of combinations you find more amusing. My personal favorite is launching people off the side and wondering if they landed in some poor NPCs living room, 20,000 feet below. ...heh.While the main purpose of re-buying the game was for the DLC campaigns, which I didn't have on PS3. I have yet to complete them yet so I wont get into them here. I just know that going back to Rapture is gonna be, and I quote, 'SIIIIIIIICK!' 1999 mode is also something I never really played, so I'll have to make a point to do so.TL;DRThis is the best game I've personally ever played. And I play a lot of f**king games, bro. As it stands nearly 3 years after it's initial release, it still has enough power to put me in existential crisis. Also Elizabeth is hot, and I feel terrible for saying that, all things considered....			"

												This is a beautiful looking game, and the story sucked me in. I'm a fan of time and domino effect stories, and as you search for answers about your past and Elizabeth's history and abilities, you'll be fully immersed in the world. As for the FPS aspect, it's fun to have a few different elements besides just guns. Having powers to lay waste to enemies, plus using the rails to jump around and travel quickly, makes for one of the best games I've played in recent years.			"

												Absolutely a must buy title! If you haven't played this game i urge you that you go and play this game. It has an incredible story (which kept me hooked until the end), amazing visuals(esspecially the lightning) and top notch gameplay. The best thing about this game is that it has a great replay value, i just beat the game like an hour or so ago and i feel like giving the campaign another go. There are only a handful of games which have a great replay value (like dishonored and assassins creed 2) and this game definately makes it to the list. The PC version feels like a completely different game compared to the console version of this game, the textures and the bloom effects are so much more appreciatable on the PC version rather than the console version of the game. Not to forget that this game is very well optimized for the PC, keeping stable FPS (above 30) even on low-end PC's(though i do recommend you play on 60fps for the best possible experience).

												Bioshock Infinite is the BEST first person shooter I have played in quite a while.  Gameplay is super fluid and never ceases to make you feel powerful.  Combat really is comprised of four different facets. Gunplay which is interesting on its own and has many different weapons to try out. Vigors (a return of plasmid like powers from the first game) that give you incredible powers that let you be more creative with your approach on combat and the enviroment. Skyhooks (the most awesome gameplay addition in my opinion) allow you to move through a battle with ease and strike down foes from above. Lastly, are Elizabeths powers to create tears which open up things like turrets, hooks, cover, or many other items or combat options which can help change the tide of a battle.  These main facets to gameplay make the game feel fresh and fun.  Everytime you aproach a group of bad guys gives you a new opportunity to experiment with the myriad of options to take out your foes.The thing of course that makes Infinite interesting is its world and story.  Columbia is a very interesting place to visit with many beautiful views and interesting characters all around.  Booker and Elizabeth have a very interesting connection ,not as deep as Joel and Ellie in The Last of Us per se ,but still great enough to keep the story interesting.Bioshock Infinite is one of those games that will be remembered for quite a while just like the first Bioshock. It's definentley a great game to close out this generation along with The Last of Us and GTAV. Bioshock Infintite 9.7/10			"

												My personal game of the year, maybe my favorite game this generation. Amazing story, probably the best ever told in videogames, paced perfectly with interesting characters that interact in ways that tend to feel more genuine than most games. Drew Holems and Ken Levine wrote a masterpiece here, fleshed out by flawless performances from Troy Baker and Courtney Draper, and bolstered by often times frantic, highly kenetic, chaotic combat that plays like no other first person shooter.What you have here are genuinely intimidating heavy hitter boss fights, especially on the higher dificulty settings. To take them down you'll get arsenal of superpowers and guns of varying flavors, enviornmental interaction ranging from suspended roller coaster rides to pulling weapons, hazards, allies, and ammo from alternate dimensions, all on the fly, and youll need them all to surviveAlso, this games has my favorite ending ever, so classily done, very touching, and not something I saw coming.The DLC has been well worth the price of the season pass thus far too, with the return to rapture providing an engaging narritive and Clash in the Clouds setting up a welcome and challenging return to Columbia's combat.Cant wait to see what Irrational does next.

												This game. There are good games and bad games. Some games can't be rated. Some games have good gameplay but horrible story as others function viceversa. This game is just perfect. That's all. I had never ever played something like this before. I just finished it (2:06 P.M 23/12/2014) and I just don't want to play anyother game. This story. This story was just too much for me. Thanks 2K Games. Thanks a lot.			"

												Bioshock Infinite is a little gem. A wonderful, shining sun displaying it's brilliance over Columbia. There is no need to have played the previous Bioshocks (I didn't at the time) to play the MAIN storyline. Not sure about the DLC, since it seems you go into Rapture during it. But DLC aside, this is a wonderful game. Now that's enough of personal love, time for some pros/cons.Pros:-Beautiful art style and graphics-Nice voice acting-Fast-paced combat, perfect for a shooter of this kind-A good melee alternative-A pretty good TV Spot trailer (despite being not right to the game), with a pretty good song. Look it up.Cons:-Horribly randomized weapon upgrades (Want an upgrade? Well let's hope the upgrade store has the one you want)-AI friend is quite random in the health/ammo/mana (bath salt) distribution-One boss is quite tough, takes strategy. That's fine. But another you have to fight three times, and is insanely difficult. THREE TIMES!-Not enough consCONCLUSION: A wonderful game, reminiscent of an uncut diamond, fresh and glistening in a Columbia sun.			"

Posted: September 15, 2015
												Out of the two Bioshock games, Infinite has over thrown over the original Bioshock just by the skin of its teeth.(Yes I said two. That God awful game called Bioshock 2 does not count.) The thing that caught my attention immediately was the atmosphere and look of Infinite. It was an alien to the series, not just because it wasn't under water anymore but with the colors, the atmosphere and THE COLORS. The city of Rapture had a feeling of isolation and despair to its world. It had the colors of a dying rainbow, dont get me wrong I loved that about it. I thought that was a key feature for the series, but I was wrong. Columbia was a ""happier"" place to be in. It was bright, colorful and the old American feel to it was outstanding as well. Columbia was just a better world to roam around than Rapture. Because it has that open feel to it that the tubes of Rapture failed to  give, thus I found myself covering every inch of the world. A big factor I noticed in Infinite Vigors (Plasmids in the old Bioshock) was not an actual highlight to the story. There is no build up to it you just literally pick it up and drink it. That was an odd thing for me. Enough about the world time for the characters.Bioshock Infinte produced a handful of memorable character compared to the first one. Your character Booker Dewitt actually talks often so it just gives him more character than just another generic piece of meat that you control. He is further highlighted by his sidekick whom I think is the star of the game. Elizabeth the girl nextdoor type or rather the girl next to a cage(I laughed at my joke more than I should.). She's smart and has a lovely feel. It's an odd feeling to see someone so happy in a game that you actually feel happy for them. Play the game and you'll know what I mean. Sadly her character development was altered faster than expected maybe it was because of the things that happening in the story. I hoped for more dialogue between Dewitt and Elizabeth because it was charming and funny how they spoke to each other. The Lutece siblings were terrific. They added a depth to the pool of characters in the game. Maybe because they were british? A game is only as good as its gameplay and Infinite's gameplay is what won me over. The added sky line feature was a major touch to it. It just adds that momentum feel to it, rather than just running around, it different I can tell you that. The Vigors available in the game worked perfectly together and was fun to think of new combos that would destroy your enemies. Weapons were abundant but I just used 3-4. There is no more hacking in the game which for was a good thing. I was never really a fan of that. Now you just have to find lockpicks for Elizabeth to use. Oh and Elizabeth is an amazing sidekick. she is actually useful. The game is now a ""loot fest"" as you can pick up a lot of things for your health, vigor and ammo. You dont have health kits anymore you need to pick up a lot of things to regenerate your health(Which I like). The enemies are'nt that memorable because they're just normal people so you'll probably miss the good old splicers. It's still a solid FPS game. My finaly Verdict is that Bioshock is a soild 9/10 game. Now I say 8 because the story is an odd one. Not that I dont get it I played the game twice just to see that I actually got it being that Im an idiot. Sadly it feels that it tried so hard to shove the story down your throat. The last 25 minutes of the game is where all of it actually makes sense rather than just spread the story through out the game so that player would slowly ""decode"" it and form their own theories as they are playing the game so that the plot twist would have been a bigger shocker. Saddly it was not as good as the first Bioshock. It had way to much sub-plots that makes you lose sight of the main story. A shame really, if only the plots intertwined as good as I hoped them to be. non the less its a good game I recommend you buying it. Just wait for sales though I noticed that this game is almost free when it goes on sale so keep that in mind. or just buy the trilogy the down side is you'll get Bioshock 2. (Sorry for some of my grammar this is my first review and English is not my mother tounge.)			"

This is a long review so if you just want a brief summary of why I recommend BioShock Infinite then skip to Results and read from there.Irrational Games takes what 2K started did and pushes it above and beyond reality. One cannot come to words for how to describe BioShock Infinite as there are no words that possibly capture its essence. Story:As you sit in your little office you are given an offer, one that will allow you to be free of all that you owe. Two people, a man and a woman, provide you with an ultimatum with you accept. You are given the opportunity to go to a world in the clouds and retrieve a girl. As you push through your mission you will learn more about yourself than you ever wanted to know. Campaign:BioShock Infinite campaign is of decent length. Depending on the difficulty you chose and your play-style you get through this game from anywhere between 10-16 hours. I would recommend taking your time as this game is more about the story than the gameplay and missing the smallest element can result in a completely different understanding. The campaign is divvied up across 40-chapters, all varying in length, some take only a minute, while others you’ll be wondering for at-least an hour. An interesting element in Infinite is that almost all of the cinematics involve player interaction. You control basic camera elements, as well as in some scenes interaction with the environment. This provides a more immersive campaign than traditional games. Gameplay:BioShock Infinite does away with tonics, ADAM, and limited weapon upgrades. Instead of Plasmids you use Vigors, which are essentially the same thing with a different name. The only currency in the game is Silver Eagles, most likely based on the US Silver Dollar and Half-Dollar. You can use this money to buy weapon upgrades, Vigor upgrades, and ammo/health/salts. Unlike in the first two you no longer need to acquire Adam to get Vigor upgrades, which means you can customize your gameplay based on what you plan to use more. I was weapon intensive so I spent all my cash on weapon upgrades, and only upgraded on Vigor for the achievement. You also don’t buy Vigors instead you unlock them for free throughout the campaign which means you will have every single one by the end of the game. There are 14-weapons that you will find throughout the campaign: Sky-Hook, Broadsider Pistol, China Boom Shotgun, Triple R Machine Gun, Huntsman Carbine, Bird’s Eye Sniper Rifle, Paddywhacker Hand Cannon, Peppermill Crank Gun, Pig Flak Volley Gun, Heater, Burstgun, Repeater, and Hail Fire. So you won’t feel limited in this game by your weapon choice, as you have more than you can ever imagine. Although despite all these choices you can only ever carry two-weapons at one time. So you will more than likely stick to what you like, as you may not get it back for a while if you let it go. A new feature to the series is Infusions; infusions are vials found throughout the campaign that allow you to increase your health, shield, or salts (mana). Depending on your play-style you may find more or less of these throughout the campaign, but you will probably not find them all. Some are in secret areas, while others are right infront of your very eyes. Infusions allow you to customize yourself without limiting your capital.Results:BioShock Infinite is an amazingly beautiful game that is aweing and terrifying at the same time. Like all BioShocks you will enter confused and cautious, but as the game unfolds you will never want to put it down. The story is beautiful, the gameplay is fantastic, the music is breathtaking, and the environment is inspirational. As you play you will learn more about yourself that you can imagine through even the simplest choices, heads or tails?Pros:+Amazing story, amazing doesn’t even breach how brilliant it is.+Beautiful environment, you will stand there just to look at how beautiful the architecture is, how elegant the people are, how clean the world is.+Amazing music, the music is simple but rather still brings much depth to the game. Even the combat music draws shivers up your spine.+Great graphics engine, as well as a fantastic optimization tool. +Awesome boss battles, which keep you on your toesCons:-The enemies are kind of lacking (Most of them are the same enemy with a different gun)-The combat AI is rather limited, I found myself taking advantage of how stupid they were on many occasions.-They got rid of the manual saves (if you have a busy schedule you sometimes don’t have time to find a checkpoint).

												Unlike so many other games, this is a story first and an action game second. The story is absolutely amazing, and Elizabeth is unlike any NPC I've ever seen. She's not a ball-and-chain to lug around, she's a character to meet and experience. I've never related with a video game character more than I've related with Elizabeth.This is an amazing game and Irrational has shown us again that they're great at wrapping a story in a video game. I'd highly recommend this. Unless something else blows me away this year to this magnitude (which I highly doubt), this is my GOTY.			"

Posted: September 27, 2015
												It’s old, it’s been covered, the plot has been spoiled and the DLC produced, yet somehow I never got caught in the media blaze that was hailing Bioshock Infinite for being one of the best narratives in gaming. In fact, I actually managed to play it completely blind well over two years after it’s release in 2013. So here’s my verdict for this once near-idolized FPS RPG: Eh it’s a pretty good game I guess.I remember the ravings and the discussions over just how mind blowing the story was and how everyone just melted into an ooze of wonder when they hit the big plot twist, but it was just good. I think whoever wrote the story did a great job and I hope they were well commended for it, but the game on the whole was nothing revolutionary. The formula was refined but essentially handled like the other BioShock titles. The gunplay wasn’t weak but certainly didn’t carry much weight. The vigors even lacked depth; I found myself only ever really using the shock/fireball/charm vigors, and I only fired the shield and tentacle one just to say I tried. If there is anything to praise about BioShock Infinite, it’s Elizabeth. No not because her “story is so fantastic” and the narrative she delivers is “mind-bending”. Honestly, she could have had next to no involvement in the plot and I would have still been blown away simply for the fact that I did not hate every single action she took. I have not seen an AI companion in a game be this not-terrible since Half Life. Every game that ever wants to do AI companions or even escort missions needs to take a good hard look at how Elizabeth behaves both in and out of combat. She never gets stuck, never halts progression, never runs into a hail of bullets to find cover behind a nearby piece of paper, doesn’t require you to hold her hand through every single encounter and in fact reliably keeps you in relatively good shape during combat by tossing you ammo, health and salts.BioShock Infinite is alright, well worth picking it up on sale for 10 or 15 bucks, but in my mind the most amazing thing about it is that someone finally made an AI companion that wasn’t the absolute worst thing on the face of the earth.

												One of the best fps games of all time and is a worthy successor to the original Bioshock. Story will blow you away and gameplay offers fresh experiences to the increasingly common military fps games of modern times. The steampunk and brilliantly immersive environment of Coulmbia ranks amongst the best game worlds created and can really compete with Rapture from Bioshock 1 as a memorable game world. The themes are quite lofty and the ending will leave discussions open for a long time after one has finished the game. in the top 3 of my fav games pf all time for sure. 10/10			"

												Os gráficos e o gameplay são muito bons, mas onde o jogo realmente brilha é em sua história. É muito difícil não sentir algum tipo de empatia por Elizabeth durante o jogo. A cidade de Columbia é belissíma, apesar de não possuir o mesmo impacto que Rapture tinha nos dois primeiros jogos, e há uma boa variedade de inimigos pra derrotar com seus plasmids. O sistema de vida é uma mistura do clássico healthpack misturado com o autoheal de uma forma que dá certo. Há uma boa variedade de armas, apesar de que eu basicamente zerei o jogo somente com a primeira pistola. A movimentacão flui muito bem apesar de ocasionais travadas quando se pula do chão para as skylines do jogo, o que pode ser especialmente frustrante em situações de combate.As DLCs são excelente, sendo basicamente jogos completamente novos, com uma nova história e um gameplay diferenciado da campanha principal, mais voltado para o stealth, o que pode ser meio estranho no começo, mas a adaptação se dá rapidamente. Vale a pena comentar também como a DLC serviu para amarrar a história do primeiro Bioshock com esse de uma forma interessante ( ainda que um tanto forçada) enquanto concluia o arco de Elizabeth e Booker.

Is that you, Eliza..beth?Game is all about Elizabeth <310/10 would Elizabeth again.Edit (2nd play through): Booker is so consumed with guilt that he developed a condition called Buttonphobia. This is clearly demonstrated in the game as he has the uncontrollable urge to slam his fist into every elevator button, in an attempt to smash it out of its metallic existence. I decided to replay the main game after getting the Season Pass on a sale, and also to complete some easy steam achievements that I've missed.Edit (Completed DLCs): The 2 Burial at Sea episodes really brings the story together. The plot is well written and matches seamlessly to BS1. I would say the combat in BAS episodes shies away from that of Infinite, especially the stealth approach in BAS2, and was really enjoyable for me.However, I am really disappointed in the lack of slamming of elevator buttons. Elizabeth did not honor her only friend (in her own words) by mimicking Booker's Buttonphobia. KappaAfter playing the entire Bioshock series, I can safely say these will remain my favourite games for a long while.			"

For a game that has the potential to open up the franchise up to a multitude of different ideas and interpretations, BioShock Infinite can feel curiously limited.			"

												Bioshock infinite. In my opinion the best of the trilogy, a must have , one of the best game of the last ten years , the storyline is awesome, but you will understand it at the end of the game (maybe), the characters are well rounded with their particular personalities. Evryting is unforgottable the location are really well made and shows the hard work of the developers , who created evry single zone with the hightes sense of particularity. I don't wanna spoil the storyline but i hightly recommend this game. Do not watch at my hours on steam. I finished the game four times on XBOX360.my vote is 9.6/10 becouse there is no perfect game.

												I bought this game on summersale 2016 after looong consideration. I don't know why it took me such a long time X) I love this game. What kept drawing me back to thinking about buying it was the art, the game's really beautiful. Storywise I didn't know much else than the trailers. I hadn't played the first two BioShocks, so the universe was new to me. The story turned out to be so rich, intelligent, interesting and emotional, it made the game billion times even better and made me want to buy the first two! I didn't know it would be so storydriven and I'm glad it is! As someone who started from third BioShock, I think you can start from that, but to understand Burial at Sea dlc better I would recommed getting to know Rapture from the first two games.All in all, it's a great game! I play it with a xbox 360 controller and find it comfortable to play with it. Some shooters don't play well with a controller, but i found it easy and fast to learn to be good with it. The game has also beautiful music and the downloadable content are also great!10/10			"

												WOW. This game is absolutely stunning. Running it in VERY HIGH makes it seem liks it's an animation movie, not a game. The story is pretty good, and the pace of the game is amazing. You can always head into a fight or look around to find some valuable supplies. The gameplay could be a bit better though, more character movement would be nice; but then this is the general style of bioshock games. If you are looking for a great game and a unbeliavable graphics experience, this is the game for you. The story is also pretty long, so you will be entertained for some time. Definetely reccomend it.			"

Especially I want to admit designers' work. This is one of the most beautiful games I've ever seen. Elizabeth out of 10, this one is an ABSOLUTE must have and is 100% worth it.

												Bioshock Infinite is firstly a first person shooter, and secondly an entry in the Bioshock series. This makes the game feel different from previous titles in  the series, in both positive and negative ways. It has a similar feel to it aesthetic-wise, there are various audio logs in the game, you go from place to place while given various directives, and the whole thing is rather linear. You are accompanied through most of the game with your companinon Elizabeth, who thankfully cannot be damaged by enemies, or the game's difficulty would be (pardon the pun) Infintely harder. The story of the game is  questionable however, it is not difficult to understand for the most part, except the last part of the game which leaves me wondering ""what the heck just happened?"" I was shocked when I beat this game not because I was particularly blown away, but it was a sense of anger instead. I just went through all that to be given such a dissatistfying ending. I felt cheated. I probably wouldn't playthrough the game again, but it was still a half decent experience to go through. The environments and the overall feel of the game is very enjoyable, and the new sky combat which the game boasts is very fun and fast, through on ground combat is nothing short of the typical first person shooter action. I have not played the DLC's yet, nor do I intend to, as my values dictate that DLC are something to be avoided if at all possible.I'd recommend this game if you are a fan of first person shooters, and if you played the other bioshock games you might have a decent time, but find yourself wishing that your were playing Bioshock 1 again.

												Bioshock Infinite is the BEST first person shooter I have played in quite a while.  Gameplay is super fluid and never ceases to make you feel powerful.  Combat really is comprised of four different facets. Gunplay which is interesting on its own and has many different weapons to try out. Vigors (a return of plasmid like powers from the first game) that give you incredible powers that let you be more creative with your approach on combat and the enviroment. Skyhooks (the most awesome gameplay addition in my opinion) allow you to move through a battle with ease and strike down foes from above. Lastly, are Elizabeths powers to create tears which open up things like turrets, hooks, cover, or many other items or combat options which can help change the tide of a battle.  These main facets to gameplay make the game feel fresh and fun.  Everytime you aproach a group of bad guys gives you a new opportunity to experiment with the myriad of options to take out your foes.The thing of course that makes Infinite interesting is its world and story.  Columbia is a very interesting place to visit with many beautiful views and interesting characters all around.  Booker and Elizabeth have a very interesting connection ,not as deep as Joel and Ellie in The Last of Us per se ,but still great enough to keep the story interesting.Bioshock Infinite is one of those games that will be remembered for quite a while just like the first Bioshock. It's definentley a great game to close out this generation along with The Last of Us and GTAV. Bioshock Infintite 9.7/10			"

The gameplay, the characters, the setting, and most of all the story was excellent. The setting of the game had a mix of brightness, darkness, joyfulness and creepiness.

												I recommend this game to completely everyone (just get the trilogy and play in sequence).The good points:StoryGameplay/ControlsAI (enemies are not particularily difficult, but the AI was smooth and polished, especially the Elizabeth's AI)The greatest point of this game is the story.The ending for this game was something I've not experienced in another video game. And I simply accepted it, sat through the credits thinking and putting it all together and it made perfectly enjoyable non-sense.I am not sure if reading a bit about quantum mechanics would increase the satisfaction of experiencing the story, or would just give you spoilers...or both (superposition if you know what i mean).P.S. If you can't digest any story other than: ""Hero X saves the Y"" then maybe you would also consider the ending as ""bad"". Constants and variables.			"

												I can proudly say that this is the best game that I have in my library and I will be very surprised if I find something that I love more. Bioshock Infinite, the sequal of the hit 2008 game Bioshock (and no I don't count Bioshock 2 because of obviouse reasons), is a thrilling game that runs buttery smooth and offers an experience like no other, allowing the player to gun down enemies by the boat-load all the while flying through the sky via an easy-to-use grapple system (it involves a track and a thing on your arm that doubles as a tool and a weapon).Not only does the game look and play great, the charaters you meet along the way are very engaging and it'll be a long time before I forget any of them, especially an entertaining pair of ginger scientists. But most importantly, you will never grow tired of your companion Elizabeth, who will always provide you with intriguing dialogue and the unique ability of picking up useful items and throwing them to you, a mechanic that has saved my♥♥♥♥♥more than once.On the whole, this is a game that you need to play at least once in your life. With excellent writing, setting, characters and gameplay, Bioshock Infinite is deffinatly a game that leaves you satisfied yet perplexed when you see the ending credits roll.			"

												Bioshock Infinite was one of the best games I've ever played. Probably said by many but I'm not lying.                                                                                  SPOILER ALERT We can say that plot is simple, the protagonist BookerDeWitt is having huge debts. In order to mmake them disappear he must bring a girl to New York. Sounds fair enough? Booker has no idea what he's going into. He gets identified as a False Shepherd and that makes him a criminal. Travelling through the flying city of Columbia, fighting with lots of enemies and seeing things that people down there can only be jealous about. Many of the old BioShock series fans are mad that the adventures of Rapture aren't continued. I can understand that, but the game is just good in my opinion. The price is not very big.Pros:Great graphicsLots of weapons and enemiesFascinating plot and endingMind break in many moments of the gameBurial at sea episode 1 and 2 (DLC) is happening in rapture so something for the underwater city fansConsAlthough there are a few DLCs for me the game was a little bit too short10-15 hours on easy or normalI would highly recommend the game too any BioShock series fan or a FPS lover.

												First thing's first: You do not need to play the original Bioshock to enjoy this, but I believe it is best to play the original first. That being said, this game is amazing. There are a lot of similiaries and differences between this and the original Bioshock. After all, they're all about a man, a city, and a lighthouse. I didn't enjoy the mechanics in this one quite as much as the original, but it was still pretty good. Plus, the skyline mechanic is a blast. Like the first one, if you enjoy good story and good atmosphere, I highly reccommend Bioshock Infinite.			"

												All the praise this game received is well earned. The overall experiece is just outstanding. It's a sum of beautifully crafted scenarios, impressive graphics, great balance between action, exploration and storytelling and most of all, a story that could easily be an Oscar nominee if Bioshock Infinite was a movie.

												I love this game, it has it all really in terms of single player; Story, interesting characters, unique interesting guns, acrobats, and to me it is far better than Bioshock 2, which I found to be slow and clumsy in control in comparison to the original Bioshock. One thng I will say is that this game is nowhere near as spooky as the original Bioshock, that game was spooky as  having sausage dinner served to you by a zombie waiter with a few missing fingers. This game though is interesting where it  is not spooky, the whole premise is something I never really thought of until I watched the previews of this game. The twist at the end was also something that the game kept very well hidden until the last few levels of the game, very clever!  The graphics are nice too, and I haven't had any trouble running this game on ultra at all, although I guess I wouldn't having a R9 290...Still I tried this game on a system I was making for a relative based around Linux Ubuntu and it also seemed to run well on that aswell with a Nvidia 660ti. Overall the game is very pretty, interesting and has a weird charm about it!			"

												First thing's first: You do not need to play the original Bioshock to enjoy this, but I believe it is best to play the original first. That being said, this game is amazing. There are a lot of similiaries and differences between this and the original Bioshock. After all, they're all about a man, a city, and a lighthouse. I didn't enjoy the mechanics in this one quite as much as the original, but it was still pretty good. Plus, the skyline mechanic is a blast. Like the first one, if you enjoy good story and good atmosphere, I highly reccommend Bioshock Infinite.			"

I cant describe how wonderful to go back to one of my favorite places in videogames world. All i can say game design and atmosphere are incredible, I made about 200 screenshots! Well done!I love the story. Its good to meet Booker and Elizabeth again.DLC is quiet harder than the game itself, you are suffering from a lack of ammo and large amount of damage from splicers. And its a good thing!So I will give this DLC 10/10, because I got everything I was expecting from this DLC. And I`m looking forward to Episode 2! The end of the Episode 1 left me so hungry			"

												Highly reccomend this game if you catch it on sale which it often is. Similar aspects to the first 2 but still very different since you explore the city in the sky of Columbia instead of the underwater city of Rapture this time around.Again, great gameplay and beautiful graphics with very interesting and thick atmosphere, combined with a very good and deep story, especially for a first person shooter. What might seem beautiful and peaceful can turn into horror and darkness. This game offers a true thrilling experience with an ending that will leave you shocked. The Bioshock series proabably has the best and deepest storyline out of any game series.			"

												One of the most influential and satisfying experiences I have had in a game to date. I consider myself a big fan of the Bioshock series, and Infinite did not dissapoint or seem to water down my expectations and anticipation for the game. It really is the greatest. Sure, there are its points of contention that result in controversy, the inventory system and the excess amount of combat, I hear about the most. However, the lack of excessive cinematics and promotion of great atmospheric detail give this game a life of its own, as the surroundings certainly tell a great deal of the story itself. You play as Booker DeWitt, a man who- well, you should just try it out for yourself, the story gets a bit complex.If you look for a game with intense atmosphere, a compelling and dominant storyline, with a dash of nostalgia, Bioshock Infinite is a great buy.

												For a  game that took me roughly 9 hours too complete, Infinite is one of my all time favourites.The beautiful setting of Columbia is one of the most amazing experiences, unlike the dark and tragic setting of its predecessors. The only let down would be the ending. while it is insightful, its mostly depressing, and feels more like a let down. It would've been nice if it had alternate endings like the first to games, but at least it helps us understand the original setting for our protagonists quest. The fact that its also quite well-read in terms of its scientific parts is that added touch, so it has some real possibility we could have a Columbia like the one in the game...Oh yeah, Elizabeths pretty hot too.

												Bioshock Infinite is visually different from its predecessors, full of bright colors with considerably less water. Even though it's not a direct sequel to other Bioshocks, it's still somehow the same and has that particular ""Bioshock"" feel. The core mechanics remain the same, and even players who have never played any FPS games should be able to enjoy this. The stunning design of the entire game just took my breath away. The storyline is simply fantastic (I would not expect anything less from this franchise) and truly worth experiencing. Bioshock Infinite's take on religion, politics, science, and history in general will blow your mind. I expected a lot from this game. It delivered so much more. Also, Elizabeth rocks. 9,5/10.Edit: I finally bought the Season Pass and it was worth every penny. The DLCs are simply fantastic, they further the story of the entire Bioshock series (not just Bioshock Infinite) and really bring back some of the old Bioshock vibe, along with your favorite characters. A perfect ending to a perfect game.			"

												Bioshock Infinite is a definitive graphical improvement when compared to its predecessors, a game whose story its not passed in Rapture but rather in another city, a flying one by the name of Columbia.The combat system is slighty improved, the gameplay keeps the basics but adds new elements for the player to interact and also new enemies and a brand new storyline which can be very confusing at times.All in all, i had a great experience exploring every little spot of the map looking for all the recordings and listening to every bit of info that i could get my hands on. Booker and Elizabeth were interesting main characters with good enough villains to back them up. You might not understand the story in just one playthrough, especially if you just go for the quick game instead of taking some time to listen to every bit of the story told by the different characters.The DLCs were okay in a way that it gave us more time with Booker and Elizabeth and their story and you will actually realize that Rapture and Columbia were more connected that we actually thought. Its a good buy if you have the money for it.8,5/10. If you are a fan of the Bioshock series, you should get this game and dont listen to the negative reviews, play it for yourself and enjoy the experience.			"

												Might as well call the game ""Micheal Bay's generic video game Infinite"" as you just run around like a jackass killing everyone in sight with little to no story telling or character development.I personally find this the most over rated game of the year. Combat is far from fun with 40% of the game being a rail shooter with a few fetch quests & “puzzles”, however, calling them “puzzles” is a far stretch as a 3 year old could figure them out. The other 60% of the game is pressing f (pick-up/grab key) on everything that glows thanks to small ammo pool for each weapon.Combat is so basic and boring you can literally head shot everyone with out popping your shields and boss fights are the same thing over and over again regardless of the difficulty. Later in the game enemies basically become bullet sponges and running out of ammo is not due to poor aim or bad decision making but more so that the game is forcing you to pick-up random weapons for no reason to acquire more ammo and add some depth to the combat.Characters are dull with no depth and the game aims to tackle a lot of “hot topics” like religion, slavery, capitalism, revolution, etc... making it feel very pretensions while expressing nothing of importance. The story is so childish you could basically play the whole game with out knowing what's going on and understand everything at the end.I find it hard to really give this game a positive score however the gorgeous environment & character models does make the game a joy to look at, but this quickly becomes over looked as the entire game's environments are the same and nothing encourages you to look for none traditional story telling within the environments.I give BioShock Infinite a 6/10 and that's pushing it; Story, combat & characters leave much to be desired but the game runs well with no bugs/glitches, the game feels like a solid PC port from console and the environments are amazing making it hard to give it anything below 6/10 (as I consider games under 5/10 broken and unplayable).Should you play BioShock? No.“Pro” Tip:Carbine + Machine Gun + Electric Salt = Cruise control			"

												This game is a miracle. From the moment you see the Columbia for the first time, you will feel what imagination is capable of. The moment you see the Columbia in all it's glory, the moment you hear the piano strings, game will make you fall in love with  it. You will feel like a little boy who comes to an amusement park for the first time in his life. The people, the buildings, the atmosphere will feel so peaceful, you'll be in a mood where you'd just choose to roleplay in Columbia instead of shooting people. But you know what you gotta do, you gotta kill. Vigors are good enough for it and weapon carry limit doesn't ruin your fun. Only bad thing about weapons is that they don't have interesting upgrades like magnetic drill upgrade in Bioshock 2. The items you find in the game doesn't differ much from each other and a bit useless. Graphics can be messed up from time to time but in general they can be described with these two words:pure awesomeness. Story is mindblowing, but you won't probably notice this until the very ending of game. If you ask about the length, it's much better that other shooter games in these days.(You can complete the game in about 13-15 hours) It's highly replayable with it's 1999 difficulty mode which unlocks when you enter a cheat code or finish the game. That's all I gotta say, buy it and you won't regret   neither forget it.			"

												BioShock Infinite could make you feel uncomfortable. If you adhere to religious faith, or celebrate American idealism, this game may invite introspection or even anger. BioShock Infinite isn't afraid to magnify the way religious and racial extremism inform our culture and change lives. It isn't afraid to depict a less-than-holy trinity diseased by power, deception, and manipulation. As the story circles back on itself, you're left wondering whether redemption cleanses us of our atrocities, or simply invites us to commit greater ones. Once the finale comes, you will want to play again, watching each event and image through the lens of information you can never un-know. BioShock Infinite is more than just a quality game: it's an important one.			"

												This game gets a fedora out of ten.  It is beyond garbage.  A lot of the other negative reviews even highlight its story as a strong point, but it's just as weak as everything else.  It's needlessly convoluted and plays to contemporary, pseudo-intelluctual discussion about quantum mysticism (which it, sadly, labels as quantum physics/mechanics; pretty damn insulting and ignorant).  Plus, BioShock Infinite's story is VERY short.  Not saying I want tedious bits just to kill time, but somehow this short game still had those parts anyway.  What was the deal with this game allegedly having ""Hollywood-level"" writing?  Is that supposed to be a positive thing?The gameplay is nearly identical to BioShock 2, save for it's more dumbed down and includes two extra forced mechanics that are rarely helpful/needed (rifts and skyhook if you need to know).  It isn't like I expect a completely different formula for a sequel, but I also don't expect practically the same.  The corridor shooter is getting stale.  What's even sadder is Doom has more enemy variety than this game.The graphics and soundtrack are cool, but if I wanted to look at pretty pictures and listen to good music I would just do that.  This is a non-point.I seriously felt like I was robbed for buying this game when it came out.  There is no replayability save for an extra difficulty unlocked after beating the game once and the overpriced DLC (which, believe me, is overpriced for what it is).  Rent this game for console or just wait for when Steam allows friends to lend it to you.  It is a big waste of money to buy.  I'm just glad I got RNGCOM: Enemy Unknown through Steam's pre-order rewards.Alternatively, check out the System Shock series.B-B-B-B-B-B-B-BAZINGA			"

												It's a game about infinite possibilities and how everything really is of no consequence. Your enjoyment of this game will hinge largely on your ability to suspend your disbelieve and to not think too much about the mechanics or interactions of/with the game world. Hopefully you also have a very strong believe that “it’s about the journey, not the destination” (which I can’t explain further because of spoilers). This game wants you to think about its ending and the impactions ONLY, and not too much about the game itself.The gameplay is fairly average, competent but not engaging. Gunplay feels very limited despite the large selection of guns due to the player’s inability to hold more than 2 guns at a time and limited resources mean that you’ll only get to upgrade certain weapons. The fun of using vigors wear thin after a while and combat just becomes a chore as you mow down waves of enemies to get to the next plot point. The Skylines are the only fun mechanic in the game but isn’t prevalent enough to make a significant difference to the overall combat experience. Overall, gameplay doesn’t feel quite satisfying enough to justify a recommendation. It’s not terrible, but since combat is the only gameplay mechanic other than savaging for resources, its mediocrity is pretty detrimental to the overall experience of the game.The story is smart and complex but suffers from pacing issues. Most of the plot bookends the game, sandwiching several hours of boring filler where little to nothing of consequence occurs. And although the game’s twist is lauded by many to be the best in recent memory, it’s honestly not that surprising when you discover the game’s themes, nor is it very unique or unexpected for a sci-fi fantasy plot. The game is also very linear, where you basically follow the plot railroad from point to point. There is little consequence to any of your actions or choices in the game and the player has absolutely no influence on the plot.Overall the story had very little impact on me, and even though there were several emotional moments near the end of the game, the story ultimately feels meaningless and empty, neither happy or sad, nor triumphant or disappointing. It’s still a very smart story but fails to connect with me on any emotional level.The game’s environments are beautiful and striking, but since the same can be said about most AAA titles nowadays, so such praise is entirely superfluous and entirely dependent on the player. It’s neither the most aesthetically impressive nor the most technically impressive game I’ve seen.Ultimately, I feel that the game is an interesting thought exercise packaged in a fairly mediocre game. It was a game created to service a story, and to me, it sacrificed too much gameplay to achieve it. The story would have been much better conveyed in a movie/series/comic/book. "

												Have you ever really spoilt a child? What happened afterwards? Were they somewhat thankless? Did they not appreciate the effort that you went through? To some degree this game really goes out to spoil you as a gamer. It spoils you with high definition graphics and art, it spoils you with a over the top music score and sound effects. Everything in the game is large, loud, vibrant and explosive. However all this spoiling has a downside too, the worst part is that it spoils you with giving you way too much advantage. The high graded weapons are too powerful, the various clothes you can wear have added perks which make the game too easy and the plasmids/infusions you get throughout the game make the difficulty of the game pretty much a no brainer. This game is so easy thanks to things like 'winter shield' I hardly found it challenging at all with the exception of the end. Seriously. Me. The guy who can't play csgo if his life depended on it, the guy who begins to weep openly when those front doors of tf2 open up, the guy who completely soils his pants everytime he sees a child in 'no more room in hell', me the guy who practically moans in every review that the game is too hard. Yes that guy, found this game soooooooooooo easy, that i was seriously yawning at parts as I ran ahead just pulling the trigger.Is the game scary? Hell no. The infusions make you so powerful, who even needs to hide in the game? Just sprint forward and kill everything. There is no need to stealth, no sneaking around required because there is a formidable opponent just around the corner waiting for you, because lets face it, if there is, he is the one in trouble, not you.The game is designed by these people... http://irrationalgames.com/ and as you are all probably aware the Bio-shock franchise was largely inspired by this golden nugget found here  . However no matter how hard they try, none of the Bioshock games quite match the same level of brilliance as 'System Shock 2' which is where the true inspiration of the game originates from.This is the third game in the series continuing from Bio-shock and Bio-shock 2, but instead of calling it Bio-shock 3 they have opted for the tag infinite. This is largely because the game plays around with the notion of alternate parralel universes especially in the contingency of the Bio-shock realm which has already been introduced in the previous two games. The problem with writing about quantum hypotheticals is that you can pretty much come up with any mumbo jumbo and they just about have.According to the alternate realities theory. Any action you do will automatically spawn another alternate universe where the opposite action/reaction was performed. For instance if you choose not to marry a certain girl in this universe, another version of you in another universe does marry that girl, which then plays out another scenario where you can have children or do not have children. Every decision/action made branches a new universe. Hence infinite possibilties, infinite universes, infinite you.The game begins with you Mr Booker De Witt discovering that you have a specialised mission to 'bring us the girl to wipe away the debt', other than that you have very little recollection of anything else previously. Ofcourse this raises a number of questions, who is the girl? Why do i have to bring her? What is the debt? Who am i? Why can't I remember anything? Eventually as you progress you discover that the girl your looking for is Elizabeth who has the special power of opening up tears where you can travel to other alternate parrarel realities. You also find out that she is locked up in large tower by a feared and yet revered guy known as Komstock who has advertised to all his flock that a false shephard will arrive to take away the girl and that the false shepherd has a mark on the back of his hand consisting of two letters A.D. Other than warning all his flock to be on the look out for the 'False Shepherd' he has also devised a mechanical monster known as the 'songbird' inspired in creation from the 'Big Daddys' in the previous two games, two protect the girl and keep her locked up in the tower.The biggest problem with the alternate universe theory is that there really is NO official time line. EVERY decision and action will branch a new reality. The game tries to fix this by getting you to follow the official timeline of the 123rd Booker De Witt where something different happens in comparison to the 122 Booker De Witts before namely that he survives a digested potion. From this point on your creating NEW ground where every action and decision again creates another hypothetical alternate reality. To further add to this confusion is that with the power of Elizabeth you can jump about through all these alternate realities influencing them too. By the end of it all you will be spoilt with the back stories of Elizabeth, Komstock, Columbia in the sky, the song bird and the list goes on spelling out everything and nicely tying up any loose ends made in the previous games. To tell you the truth the writers did a pretty superb job in solving pretty much everything, but it does not mean that this in fact works. IT DOESN'T. There are so many loopholes in this story that one could still write a book about it.(Serious Spoilers below)For instance during the game you will work out that your opting out of baptism created a completely different character in comparison to the guy who went through it. At the end the only solution presented to you is that you must be killed so that no more Booker De Witts get created. You pretty much stand there and accept this fatality as a noble and essential happening to save mankind in general. In truth there are so many more ways the problem could have been solved. The only reason why you seek baptism is because of an attrocity you commited in the battle of 'wonded knee' therefore if you simply pulled out a gun and shot yourself in the foot before the battle began you still would have saved all mankind and yourself as well. But alas you never take such things into account and accept death. Ofcourse the fact that someone kills you in this reality automatically means that in another reality someone does not and hence the story continues infinitely.(end of spoilers)Is the game violent? The first encounter you have against hostiles is pretty much the worst when it comes to violence. You start off required to rotate a saw blade through the head of a few police and there is no way to really get around that, but it is short and before you know it your presented with a gun where you can shoot them all from a distance. As you power up the weapons though you can pretty much explode your enemies too, so keep that in mind.After all said and done, there is enough graphically and story wise to give this a solid thumbs up, however the gamers are spoilt ridiculously with having too much at their disposal. There is no horror survival, no stealth, no rationing your ammo needed here. I highly recommend you play the first two games before attempting this, I also highly recommend that you place this game on the hardest difficulty before you embark on the adventure so that you really get the most out of it. For most people the eyecandy alone will be enough for them, for other the simple fact that you get to shoot things and make things go BOOM would be another reason to love the game. However for the gamers looking for something really challenging do not get your hopes up. There is a LOT of hype with this game. Its a good game, but its by no means the GREATEST game ever.			"

I can think of many games which are far greater than this and aren't trying quite so hard. The positive: It's pretty and the weapons are inventive. Overall, I wouldn't bother, it's really not that special. "

												Might as well call the game ""Micheal Bay's generic video game Infinite"" as you just run around like a jackass killing everyone in sight with little to no story telling or character development.I personally find this the most over rated game of the year. Combat is far from fun with 40% of the game being a rail shooter with a few fetch quests & “puzzles”, however, calling them “puzzles” is a far stretch as a 3 year old could figure them out. The other 60% of the game is pressing f (pick-up/grab key) on everything that glows thanks to small ammo pool for each weapon.Combat is so basic and boring you can literally head shot everyone with out popping your shields and boss fights are the same thing over and over again regardless of the difficulty. Later in the game enemies basically become bullet sponges and running out of ammo is not due to poor aim or bad decision making but more so that the game is forcing you to pick-up random weapons for no reason to acquire more ammo and add some depth to the combat.Characters are dull with no depth and the game aims to tackle a lot of “hot topics” like religion, slavery, capitalism, revolution, etc... making it feel very pretensions while expressing nothing of importance. The story is so childish you could basically play the whole game with out knowing what's going on and understand everything at the end.I find it hard to really give this game a positive score however the gorgeous environment & character models does make the game a joy to look at, but this quickly becomes over looked as the entire game's environments are the same and nothing encourages you to look for none traditional story telling within the environments.I give BioShock Infinite a 6/10 and that's pushing it; Story, combat & characters leave much to be desired but the game runs well with no bugs/glitches, the game feels like a solid PC port from console and the environments are amazing making it hard to give it anything below 6/10 (as I consider games under 5/10 broken and unplayable).Should you play BioShock? No.“Pro” Tip:Carbine + Machine Gun + Electric Salt = Cruise control			"

Second--any game that starts to mess with time really needs to take a leason from timeshift or any other time changing games that we have seen.  This game was amazing--great story, graphics, a loveable character.  But--the ending made it terrible.  If you catch it on sale and want to finish the series, sure.  After all, you even make it back to rapture.  Otherwise, avoid.			"

												Good story, visuals, and combat mechanics.  Excellent voice acting, as is typical of the Bioshock games.  Can be a bit *too* cinematic at times, taking the player out of the game for cut-scenes.  Also by the end of the game the combat gets a bit repetitive.  Short but entertaining game, definitely worth playing.			"

												It's Gone Home with guns. False choice system, no matter what you choose (heads/tails, cage/dove) it has no effect on gameplay or ending. Those ""Boys of Silence"", I think they're called, only show up once in the entire game.Upgrades to guns have no actual change to the design like in Bioshock.			"

												Buy this game. Bioshock Infinite is no doubt the best game of 2013, if not the entire decade. The gameplay is very fun, the atmosphere is brilliantly constructed (and beautiful in places) and the story is nothing short of mind-blowing. Play it or regret it. One of the few games on Steam worth paying full price for, and quite frankly you're wasting your money if you're buying anything else and you don't already own this.10/10 (This is to gaming what Breaking Bad is to TV)Also play the DLC, the second part is better than the first, but they're both excellent additions to an incredible franchise.

												Bioshock Infinite is a definitive graphical improvement when compared to its predecessors, a game whose story its not passed in Rapture but rather in another city, a flying one by the name of Columbia.The combat system is slighty improved, the gameplay keeps the basics but adds new elements for the player to interact and also new enemies and a brand new storyline which can be very confusing at times.All in all, i had a great experience exploring every little spot of the map looking for all the recordings and listening to every bit of info that i could get my hands on. Booker and Elizabeth were interesting main characters with good enough villains to back them up. You might not understand the story in just one playthrough, especially if you just go for the quick game instead of taking some time to listen to every bit of the story told by the different characters.The DLCs were okay in a way that it gave us more time with Booker and Elizabeth and their story and you will actually realize that Rapture and Columbia were more connected that we actually thought. Its a good buy if you have the money for it.8,5/10. If you are a fan of the Bioshock series, you should get this game and dont listen to the negative reviews, play it for yourself and enjoy the experience.			"

												This game is a miracle. From the moment you see the Columbia for the first time, you will feel what imagination is capable of. The moment you see the Columbia in all it's glory, the moment you hear the piano strings, game will make you fall in love with  it. You will feel like a little boy who comes to an amusement park for the first time in his life. The people, the buildings, the atmosphere will feel so peaceful, you'll be in a mood where you'd just choose to roleplay in Columbia instead of shooting people. But you know what you gotta do, you gotta kill. Vigors are good enough for it and weapon carry limit doesn't ruin your fun. Only bad thing about weapons is that they don't have interesting upgrades like magnetic drill upgrade in Bioshock 2. The items you find in the game doesn't differ much from each other and a bit useless. Graphics can be messed up from time to time but in general they can be described with these two words:pure awesomeness. Story is mindblowing, but you won't probably notice this until the very ending of game. If you ask about the length, it's much better that other shooter games in these days.(You can complete the game in about 13-15 hours) It's highly replayable with it's 1999 difficulty mode which unlocks when you enter a cheat code or finish the game. That's all I gotta say, buy it and you won't regret   neither forget it.			"

												For a  game that took me roughly 9 hours too complete, Infinite is one of my all time favourites.The beautiful setting of Columbia is one of the most amazing experiences, unlike the dark and tragic setting of its predecessors. The only let down would be the ending. while it is insightful, its mostly depressing, and feels more like a let down. It would've been nice if it had alternate endings like the first to games, but at least it helps us understand the original setting for our protagonists quest. The fact that its also quite well-read in terms of its scientific parts is that added touch, so it has some real possibility we could have a Columbia like the one in the game...Oh yeah, Elizabeths pretty hot too. (better with the ponytail imo)			"

												Bioshock: Infinite is just gorgeus. Graphics not only are good, but also the art style of the game is awesome.Exploring never gets boring because there's always something new to see. The story is actually good, dialogues makes the characters more human and imerses you even more in this world. Actually, the amount of times that i tought of the same things as my character were various, and this is actually awesome.I just can't see how it is named ""Bioshock"". I mean, they even sayed it was kind of a prequel. But besides gameplay, i don't see anything that leads to either Bishock 1 or 2.Either way, that doesn't take aways the magic of a Bioshock game. Plasmids are various and most of them are useful. You can upgrade both weapons and plasmids, witch is awesome. And also there upgrades for shield, life and ""mana"". The only thing that i din't liked about plasmids is how Fire Plasmid was nerfed. I miss throwing fire balls at my enemies...It just doesn't feel the same here, but that's just me.Searching can be much rewardfull, there's many trinkets, voxtron and money to collect. Just like old Bioshock games. This time, exploring some areas can be different. Like in Bioshock 2, you might need a key or a decoder to acess a certain secret. Witch is okay to me, since the secrets in this areas helps a lot.The game runs pretty fine. Honestly. Even in the highest settings. Controls respond with no problem and auto-aim can help anyone who doesn't have experience with FPS games.If i can say something bad about this game is the IA. Not that they are stupid or something, but i started on hard and din't have one single death until now. I din't beat the game yet but already had some mini boss fights and...They weren't a big of a deal. I guess i was expecting a challenge like i had on Bioshock 1 (That game was hard for me). I think the shield thing let the game a bit easier for gamers of the new generation. Meh...What can i do about it?At least hardcore players should've been given the option to turn the shield off, just my opinion. I miss the times of carrying med packs and always struggling for life while fighting big dads and sentrys. That's the only feel that Infinite couldn't gave me.That said. I really recomend this game. It's awesome in many ways, mainly for it's art style and nice story.But for Bioshock fans: Watch out, you're walking in a whole new thing. Some fans may don't like what they see. Or even think that the game isn't challenging enough. If you walk in this game in a open mid, taking it like a spinoff or even a reboot, you can make your way to like it.			"

												Welp, Bioshock Infinite, A frustratingly fun game that isn't as good as the original. Why isn't it as good? Well, it's the ending and sort of the story to really. It's like they teased you with a little bit of story at the beggining, got hung up with creating the game, then loudly exclaimed. ""Oh ♥♥♥♥! John, we forgot that whole story thing in the middle. Should we just add it all in the end? Yeah, just put all the rest of the story into some sort of semi-interactive Cinematic piece thing?. Yes i'm sure it'll work. Alright we'll do it."" And so they did that and no, it doesn't work. It is a good story once you fully understand it (lots of googling) and it's a neat concept, but compaed to the original, it's lacking. Ssort of dissapointing too to find out that your choices in the game ultimately don't matter unlike in the first one where if you decided to set up your daddy-day-care-esk nursery for the little sisters then you got rewarded and got a different ending. And the patriot fights are nowhere's near as butt-clenchingly exciting as the Big Daddy fights in the original, nor are the weapons as creative as in the original. The scenery is awesome and you'll be impressed when you first begin, but it grows dull after a while. It suffers from spouts of genericitis, much like my reviews and daily meals.If you're going into this game expecting it to be better or just as good as the original, then it's a dissapointed 6/10. If not, maybe a 8/10, why no 9/10? Because holy ♥♥♥♥ is shooting the same enemies over and over ever repetative, even on medium difficulty, you litterally have to go into full grind mode just to get through some areas. Though you will be happily entertained through the game otherwise. Get it when it's bellow $10, possibly $20 if you really, really want to play it, that's what it feels like it's worth to me. "

												Not that much of a review, just some pointers that had an impact upon me, I really enjoyed the game and that is why I am recommending it.1. All those things to collect, appeal to my ocd, all the voxaphones, all the telescopes and infusions, i need to get them all...and i need to search for them for hours and hours every corner, every spot2. The little girls models are bad, and i mean quite bad.Besides the fact that all have the same clothes, the same model over and over again, like clones, they are butt ugly, husky, and look as if they suffer of cyphose (that weird hunchback), and lack any sort of personality. The boys, they seem more various, different clothes and idle actions etc. Why couldn't they use the little sisters or something close to that in Columbia?3. The story seems a bit shady so far, you mean she didn't quite question most of the stuff? A stranger came, put me in mortal perril, meh, ♥♥♥♥ it, I'll join him, cus yeah, the safety of my tower, even if i was monitored and examined etc. it's too mainstream. She could use some of her powers while still in the tower, why not evade if she wanted that so badly? Well, things do evolve so I learn not to question some stuff.4. The sky-hook, is so wrong on so many levels, how does it work?! ♥♥♥♥ing magnets. Magic! Still awesome thou!5. Mind-blowing ending, made the entire journey worth it.6. No special ammo like in bioshock, so now the gunplay feels a bit poorer than usual (except the sky-hook, no innovative non-generic weapon), I guess you have some clothes, but some effects are really useful while others are really useless.7. The Burial at Sea episodes really tie everything together it's also a nice nostalgia trip in the Rapture universe.			"

												Thanks to a mix of steam crashes, glitches, and other fun things like having the entire game delete itself when it first finished downloading, it took me almost two full weeks before I finally got this game installed on my PC. I'm not sure it if was my zombie PC or Steam being a jerk, but it was probably the worst experience i've ever had installing something on a computer in my entire life. And that's really saying something considering how long i've been playing games.When I finally got to playing the game however... it was pretty much the opposite experience of what installing it was like: I couldn't get enough of it. Before too long, I found that about 12 hours had passed and I had finished the whole game... in one sitting. And yet I could have kept going if the game was longer. Whether that is a testament to the game's ability to suck me in and keep my interest, or proof of my insanity, is uncertain. I'm thinking both.I was not a fan of Bioshock 1 (I thought it was just ok), and Bioshock 2 was just bad in pretty much all aspects. I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I did. And yet that is how things turned out. The only bad things I can say about this game is that the final boss fight is lame and that when I eventually go achievement hunting finding all those damn audio recordings is going to be a pain.*Anyway, this is a yummy one. Have fun! :D*It was. At least there were guides for it all.			"

												This game has astonishing and smart storyline. It is amazing how player gets to interact with it on almost every step, involvement and atmosphere are strong, so you actually feel and live this story through by yourself. There are couple drastic plot holes, but the fact its quite complex and wide - makes that issue hardly noticeable or just ignorable in general.Gameplay is kind of a let down. It not that bad, but its just a trivial shooter. There are no tactical aspects involved during battles. Developers added many interesting combat features, but did not any motivation to use those other than ""for fun"". There are no any sort of puzzles and all easter eggs (side missions) are quite boring (just running back and forth, searching every corner). All that makes gameplay linear and repetitive at a times.9/10 - A ""must play"" for a whole new experience that hardly any game can offer.			"

												Bioshock Infinite is visually different from its predecessors, full of bright colors with considerably less water. Even though it's not a direct sequel to other Bioshocks, it's still somehow the same and has that particular ""Bioshock"" feel. The core mechanics remain the same, and even players who have never played any FPS games should be able to enjoy this. The stunning design of the entire game just took my breath away. The storyline is simply fantastic (I would not expect anything less from this franchise) and truly worth experiencing. Bioshock Infinite's take on religion, politics, science, and history in general will blow your mind. I expected a lot from this game. It delivered so much more. Also, Elizabeth rocks. 9,5/10.Edit: I finally bought the Season Pass and it was worth every penny. The DLCs are simply fantastic, they further the story of the entire Bioshock series (not just Bioshock Infinite) and really bring back some of the old Bioshock vibe, along with your favorite characters. A perfect ending to a perfect game.			"

												Bioshock Infinite, proves that videogames can be used as an artform. The story is amazing and if you haven't already completed it, do it now. Drop everything and sink into the wonderous city of Columbia for the next 10-15 hours, you will not regret it. But, outside of the story the characters are amazingly voice acted by Troy Baker and Courtney Draper, Booker and Elizabeth respectively. They bring an element i have never seen before in a videogame, Elizabeth is like a person who you can fall in love with infinitly, no matter what. To top off all of the story and characters there is also the amazing graphics. Columbia is gorgeous even now a year and a half later. Even with everything else perfect they still included fun and innovative gameplay with the skyhook and great gunplay. I can't reccomend this game enough to anyone. Even a year and a half later from the first time i finished this masterpiece it still affects me and I continue to play it.			"

Well done!I love the story. Its good to meet Booker and Elizabeth again.DLC is quiet harder than the game itself, you are suffering from a lack of ammo and large amount of damage from splicers.

												By FAR...the best PC/Console series of this generation (as you can tell by my hours, I can't stop playing). BioShock is absolutely the most fascinating series I have played. From the original to infinite, it never seems to not please the player. It is a must buy, and a must play. However, make sure you start from the original BioShock to understand what is going on in infinite. 10/10, would play numerous amount of times, as I have done already.			"

												Hello boys and girls, step right up and experience Bioshock Infinite - The one and only video game to feature graphics that appear more stunning than the graphics in real life! That's right graphics-obsessed mainstream gamer crowd, get your salivary glands as hyped up as the fanboys of this here game, because you're in for the ride of your lives through the first literal shooter on rails!Yes, you heard me right - this game is the first shooter on rails to actually involve shooting while on rails! As you glide gracefully through the air without ever fearing for your life, you will find yourself pitted against fellow rail-riders that will also be firing at you as you fire at them. But don't worry! This game is more than ready to account for your lack of an attention span, and will gladly reduce the odds of you getting shot while riding on these rails to next to zero!Be prepared to be awed by this game's incredible involvement of the theory of relativity, which will leave you, like many fanboys, baffled and confused with its remarkable ending that completely forgets the grandfather paradox! But don't question the lack of thought put into its use of time and space, nor how people can live in a floating city like this without passing out from low oxygen! None of this should matter when you're rapidly firing a rocket launcher, and being hit in the head with a wrench by a girl you just saved!But graphics aren't all this game features, it also boasts amazing features never seen before in video game history! Features, such as; Racism, skyhook assassinations, firefights on rails (as mentioned before, but it's worth repeating!), classical music, crazy religious people, and most of all: Elizabeth's magical ability to pull weapons and money from thin air!Mainstream shooter fans rejoice! This game, unlike the others in the franchise, realizes that you're too simple-minded to possibly keep up with multiple weapons, and so it limits you to only two at once! Don't worry about figuring out which two weapons you like - they've gone out of their way to make sure that only a small portion of the handful of weapons available are actually useful in the game, so you'll be just fine!So throw your science book out the window, forget Einstein existed, and prepare to enter the floating city of Columbia through the eyes of Booker Dewitt, he's just your average ex-military gun-wielding father who is able to immediately go from retrieving a girl for a 100% legit client, to taking on an entire army of soldiers! Become immersed in his epic tale, as he rescues a Paris-obsessed girl named Elizabeth, who shows absolutely no respect for our clearly trustworthy protagonist, and will not think twice about running away, or otherwise physically harming him, despite the fact that he is the only reason she ever escaped at all!So join the hype train, and buy Bioshock Infinite - your eyes will not regret it, but your mind might!

												 Oh what can be said about this game that hasn't been said. The gameplay is solid, and the graphics are good. But, the story is amazing. I paid a dollar for this game from GMG and it is the best dollar I have spent. This is one those games you really should play.			"

												Visually intriguing, but otherwise a generic shooter, with cliched writing. The game has a few good concepts, but it never truly utilizes either of them, or in some cases, they just fall too short of being interesting. The world is set up to be big and explorable, but then changes direction, and ends up being a literal horde fest, with little to no user interaction. You can collect things, and that's about it. Most of the weapons are horrible, and you'll find yourself constanly looking for ammo. Even though you're able to buy them from dispensers, It's just never enough, and you end up running back and forth in search for it.Because of this, and the linear 'hit-n-run' objectives, the gameplay quickly becomes boring and repetitive. The game tells you at the start, that it's not always the best option to fight, however, you can't do much else, seeing how sneaking is either practically impossible, or it goes overboard and your enemies won't notice you, even after you repetadly stab them in the back.The 'Story Rich' tag is ridiculous, as the whole plot can be summed up within 2 sentences. Character development is forced, and badly timed, with idiotic symbolism, that just feels out of place. An example would be making a character randomly cut her hair, for the sake of showing a personal 'change', which is laughable and weak. A woman won't suddenly become more masculine and reliable from a change in hair style, nor will that show any determination. It's also painfully obvious, that the inclusion of such and similar tropes were for fetishistic reasons, and lazy writing. The creators tried to justify all this with a wannabe 'artistic' ending, with make-belief deepness, which ends up being half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and totally out of place.All in all, it's clear that this was made for a more casual, and child like audience, who's only reference for comparison is COD.##############################UPDATE#############################So I came back to this game after half a year, and replayed it, thinking that I might have been too harsh on it. What I came to find, wasn't that big of a difference.The thin plot not only makes me cringe, but manages to have more holes in it than an empty shopping cart. There's numerous things that don't even make sense, I bet the lead writer just thought, that using transdimensional time traveling will just 'fix itself', and 'oh well but it's just a different dimension' will be a good enough excuse for bad writing. Albeit I have to admit that one or two supporting characters are indeed interesting. The  guns aren't as horrible as I remembered, but they're definetaly bad. It doesn't help that the game misleads you either, it constantly reminds you that short bursts are more accurate, and effective against enemies, which is not true at all. If you've ever played any FPS games, you would think like that statement, and would certainly approve it, but in this game, that's not happening. Simply because there's literary no recoil on anything, and it doesn't matter how you use your weapons, the accuracy will be the exact same thing. Using small amounts of bursts against multiple 'tanks' is practically suicide in most cases, it's a lot more effective to just camp and hold down your fire button, and spam your enemy with bullets. So yeah, go and trust the game, and you'll be constantly seeing the revive animation.Vigors help you a lot, but again, the game eats your ammo as fast as a Mortal Kombat arcade machine. There are instances where it's impossible to even stock up on any ammo for any weapon, and you'll be facing a horde of enemies without any. Relying solely on your generic 'melee'' attack, makes surviving a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ I tell ya. It also doesn't help that you sometimes can get stuck in an object lying on the ground, or hear enemies, but can't see them, until you use bucking bronco, pushing them afloat in the air, because they decided to bug into the ground. In some cases, the amount of projectile, and effects makes it literary impossible to see anything, rendering you practically blind, until you somehow manage to get onto a skyline, or in a safe cover. Civillians also just randomly disappear most of the time, but I guess that's just me nitpicking too much. Oh yes, shout out to the people claiming that BI is ballsy for having 3 instances (literary that many sentences) of reference to racism: It's not.I wouldn't say it's a bad game, it's decent, and somewhat replayable, with an interesting world concept, but there's a lot of room for improvement, especially with the combat system, so my review stays negative. It could have been easily better with a coherent writer, and some gameplay elements could still be post-fixed with a patch, but I don't see that ever happening.			"

												Not that much of a review, just some pointers that had an impact upon me, I really enjoyed the game and that is why I am recommending it.1. All those things to collect, appeal to my ocd, all the voxaphones, all the telescopes and infusions, i need to get them all...and i need to search for them for hours and hours every corner, every spot2. The little girls models are bad, and i mean quite bad.Besides the fact that all have the same clothes, the same model over and over again, like clones, they are butt ugly, husky, and look as if they suffer of cyphose (that weird hunchback), and lack any sort of personality. The boys, they seem more various, different clothes and idle actions etc. Why couldn't they use the little sisters or something close to that in Columbia?3. The story seems a bit shady so far, you mean she didn't quite question most of the stuff? A stranger came, put me in mortal perril, meh, ♥♥♥♥ it, I'll join him, cus yeah, the safety of my tower, even if i was monitored and examined etc. it's too mainstream. She could use some of her powers while still in the tower, why not evade if she wanted that so badly? Well, things do evolve so I learn not to question some stuff.4. The sky-hook, is so wrong on so many levels, how does it work?! ♥♥♥♥ing magnets. Magic! Still awesome thou!5. Mind-blowing ending, made the entire journey worth it.6. No special ammo like in bioshock, so now the gunplay feels a bit poorer than usual (except the sky-hook, no innovative non-generic weapon), I guess you have some clothes, but some effects are really useful while others are really useless.7. The Burial at Sea episodes really tie everything together it's also a nice nostalgia trip in the Rapture universe.			"

Is a must-have if you really enjoy the FPS genre, but, to be honest, if you are one of those guys that really loved BioShock 1 and 2, just be careful if you haven't played this game.Short review, but this game is that kind of games, that's better to avoid any kind of spoilers and everyone just need to play it. For better performance, play this game Locked to 30FPS or Locked to 60FPS. And above Med Settings to really enjoy the experience.			"

Let me tell you this is one of the single greatest games I have ever encountered in my entire life. The story line to this game is so jawdroppingly fantastic its difficult to comprehend. The developers of this game should win every award humanly possible for producing the single greatest story plot in the history of all games. I was so awestruck at the end of this game I looked up a summary guide on what it all ment. The shortest guide I could find was 3 pages long and I read all of it becasue the story is so fantastic and it really draws you in. I would HIGHLY recommnend this game to all people. If you don't purchase this game and experince the story, im sorry but you are really missing out. 10/10			"

												Thanks to a mix of steam crashes, glitches, and other fun things like having the entire game delete itself when it first finished downloading, it took me almost two full weeks before I finally got this game installed on my PC. I'm not sure it if was my zombie PC or Steam being a jerk, but it was probably the worst experience i've ever had installing something on a computer in my entire life. And that's really saying something considering how long i've been playing games.When I finally got to playing the game however... it was pretty much the opposite experience of what installing it was like: I couldn't get enough of it. Before too long, I found that about 12 hours had passed and I had finished the whole game... in one sitting. And yet I could have kept going if the game was longer. Whether that is a testament to the game's ability to suck me in and keep my interest, or proof of my insanity, is uncertain. I'm thinking both.I was not a fan of Bioshock 1 (I thought it was just ok), and Bioshock 2 was just bad in pretty much all aspects. I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I did. And yet that is how things turned out. The only bad things I can say about this game is that the final boss fight is lame and that when I eventually go achievement hunting finding all those damn audio recordings is going to be a pain.*Anyway, this is a yummy one. Have fun! :D*It was. At least there were guides for it all.			"

												Though not as solid and near-perfect as the first BioShock, a superb game. Beautiful to look at, smooth gameplay, fun, clever AI, no fall damage and even one-click-away-navigational-help for us with orientation difficulties.There's a difficulty spike by the end fight though which is unwarranted and makes that fight repetetive and boring rather than challenging and thrilling. There are also some sound issues where the sound completely cuts off unless you stand exactly at the source of it which takes you out of the game a bit. Also very few character models, which makes the whole city of Columbia seems like one big bunch of inbreeds, but perhaps that can be worked into a point with the racism overtones. It can also be frustrating making out where you are being shot from at times.Overall though, the positives far outweighed the negatives. I particularly enjoy the enviromental narratives, music cues when all the enemies in a wave has been taken care of, Elizabeth as a companion being useful and invulnerable during the ingame fights, though she did block my path at a handful of times for just a short moment, but that's being extremely nitpicky. The enviroments are breathtakingly beautiful many times, and swinging on and from the sky hooks is a blast, just as is using this games versions of plasmids. Voice acting is also great, and I thought it was fun to have female enemies for variation and not only male ones, just like in the previous BioShocks.*MINOR SPOILERS* I personally had no issues with the ending, but then I usually don't have issues with leaving some things to be interpreted and/or left unsaid, though I can see why people like their endings neatly wrapped up. *SPOILERS END*			"

												If you are anything like me - you would of... Hang on - we are alike! Didn't we pass each other at the near end of the game when you went into your own lighthouse in the middle of the sea ala Bioshock? I was trying to come towards you and say hello but Elizabeth was forging another path for me.Or maybe we did not meet. Because you died - or maybe I died - maybe I finished the adventure you could not because you ran out of ammo. Maybe you took on the baton after I dropped it in the mental asylum having not concentrated at all on melee combat and paid a heavy price.If you are anything like me - you would be a father, perhaps have children - this game is perfect for you, perfect .I was going to write a partly negative review of this one - but I waited until I completed the game and have changed my mind a bit.This game is an average shooter - but amazing, incredible gaming experience.Firstly - let me say I have played System Shock, still have my System Shock 2 CDs and also played Bioshock 1 and 2.My biggest regret about this franchise is how it has been moving from FPS/RPG hybrid adventure type to pure FPS . Having said that - the shooter aspect has never been one of its strengths, okay by my standards, but really they have been about storytelling, imagination, creating worlds, the experience.Bioshock Infinite has dumbed down a bit - probably to accommodate the console crowd - Consolisation is happening, below is partly why:I did not like you could only carry two weapons, could only scroll through two rigours, could only have ONE save at a time?Say if my son wanted to play the game as well - he might have played on an easier mode - his saved game would have wiped out mine - now come on - what is the point of that?I found the keyboard layout a nightmare and would have liked the melee option a bit easier to use. Press V to hit with a weapon? What a daft choice!I found the use of rigours difficult - often the game would have to remind me to use them - I could have gone most of the game without them. The game interface did not help - often I could not find the right vigour for the situation. Why not tab, choose vigour option?I have never really liked the way the designers hide a lot of the backstory with the audio logs - this should be improved in future games -Plus - if you moved from the spot once turning one of these machines on - often you missed what was being said due to some other game words/text cutting through it - I would have liked to have the option to read the text on the machines. Can you press tab/ escape and read the logs all over again? Why not?It means after you played the game you need to go across the internet to find out what the hell was happening - otherwise the game can come across as lame and boring, a standard shooter, actually not even that.The using of tears (to another dimension) facility was a bit useless, Singularity did it better - and that is not saying much. It seems the designers found it quite hard to incorporate that part of the game properly. They mostly felt contrived and enforced onto the gamer.A lot more negatives by the way - don't get me started on the pants and hats and little missions to find a key to open a chest. More and more besides that...Now that stuff is out of the way - the game ended up being AMAZING, probably the most effective gaming EXPERIENCE I have ever had.The Elizabeth character - wow - completely amazing - you meet her about a quarter way in - do the whole ""I'm here to rescue you"" and most of the remaining game is in her company. I must say the designers found a winning formula here - totally brilliant. When you lose her at a key moment and try and go back and save her - can't describe how I felt - but it did feel very personal and ominous - genuinely like you did not want to let her down - genuinely concerned - she was just not another game character - the designers got that spot on. Due to the relationship build up with her beforehand, when you lose her and fail, yes, YOU FAIL, it feels quite real actually, Had a lump in my front and part of that was not knowing what the hell was going on..The relationship between your character and Elizabeth IS THE GAME, give it time, don't give up on it - the rewards come late on but will totally thrill you, haunt you and question the nature of all games.The shooter bit - this one was a bit unusual in that sometimes I could not get my bearings and find out where the shots were coming from. I thought this was a bit naff - but I am going to give the designers a bit of credit here - that was probably because your opponents could be in front, behind, above, below, to the left, to the right etc. Enemies could stand on flying ships that are above, below, left, to the right (you get the picture). The City in the Clouds combat was okay actually - will be interesting to see if anyone else comes and does it better.The graphics - simply gorgeous at key points, especially at the beginning when you enter a bright and colourful city in the clouds -  and then some other amazing graphic moments. No one creates a graphics style better - totally original and believable.So, if you are anything like me - games such as Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind and Daggerfall are the best games you ever played. System Shock 2 comes quite high on your list. Deep down, you know games will never be like that again - it's all about the graphics. Story telling either created by you or set by a games design are mostly too complicated to produce.So, if you are anything like me, you will immensely enjoy this unique gaming experience and afterwards wish you had someone to talk to about your feelings and thoughts about it. Thanks for taking on the baton after I fell. "

 A rare, beautiful, exciting and one of Gamings Shining MomentsQuite simply the best single player story driven game ever made in my opinion. It wasnt until I found myself lacking a great single player experience to be had in the past year or so that I decided to repurchase Bioshock Infinite on Steam and see how it held up. It held up great, but even moreso the gameplay, story, and experience still outshines its peers.Here is just a few things that make this game so great     It has an absolutely brilliant story! I cant say enough about how cohesive, thought out, and realized this story is. The thing that sticks out the most to me is that this game has some absolutely insane huge twists, yet your too wrapped up in the whats happening now with your character and Elizabeth that you never see it coming.Gameplay that is unrivaled. Its a first person shooter that executes well, it does this because it doesnt try to be something its not, and knows what type of experience they want you to have. You have one arm that is designated for weapons (Brutally easy to swap) and the other hand is for your vigors (powers)  that you pick up along the way. Using both of these together and often is so seamless. The game has light RPG elements only in the sense that you have to choose what weapons and vigors (powers) to upgrade with your hard earned coins you pick up. That suits this style of game lovely, as you dont stay away from the story very long flopping through in menu screens.Graphics are still really polished and do no injustice to this game what so ever. The whole art style is fantastic. It plays out like a city built in the sky to resemble Heaven and Americana Circa 1940s. The music is beautiful, and accompanies it well.The game genre I guess would be Science Fiction FPS/Adventure. The thing that makes it so hard to put this game into this category is that there are some genuinely spooky moments, some genuinely Tony Hawk and now Sunset Overdrive style gameplay flying around on Rails, and genuinely just an amazing adventure game.The Rapture DLC is a real treat for all of those who missed being in Rapture, the story is quite awesome as well. Highly Recomend it.Ok I know Im gushing here, but this game ladies and gents, is quite frankly a very rare gem. It should be had by all. I think of it as the Shawshank Redemption, Michael Jordan Game Six, Eminem the Marshall Mathers LP of video games. ** Note this is my second purchase of this game, and fourth to fifth playthrough.

												A great game, well worth the money. I recommend buying the whole series, Bioshock, Bioshock 2, and Bioshock Infinite as all the games are very good, and all tie in together. You won't regret buying the game and it will provide you with hours of fun.			"

												Though not as solid and near-perfect as the first BioShock, a superb game. Beautiful to look at, smooth gameplay, fun, clever AI, no fall damage and even one-click-away-navigational-help for us with orientation difficulties.There's a difficulty spike by the end fight though which is unwarranted and makes that fight repetetive and boring rather than challenging and thrilling. There are also some sound issues where the sound completely cuts off unless you stand exactly at the source of it which takes you out of the game a bit. Also very few character models, which makes the whole city of Columbia seems like one big bunch of inbreeds, but perhaps that can be worked into a point with the racism overtones. It can also be frustrating making out where you are being shot from at times.Overall though, the positives far outweighed the negatives. I particularly enjoy the enviromental narratives, music cues when all the enemies in a wave has been taken care of, Elizabeth as a companion being useful and invulnerable during the ingame fights, though she did block my path at a handful of times for just a short moment, but that's being extremely nitpicky. The enviroments are breathtakingly beautiful many times, and swinging on and from the sky hooks is a blast, just as is using this games versions of plasmids. Voice acting is also great, and I thought it was fun to have female enemies for variation and not only male ones, just like in the previous BioShocks.*MINOR SPOILERS* I personally had no issues with the ending, but then I usually don't have issues with leaving some things to be interpreted and/or left unsaid, though I can see why people like their endings neatly wrapped up. *SPOILERS END*			"

												In a world obsessed with Open World, Bioshock dares to write a tightly scripted story. They pull it off by  - delivering stunning visuals consistantly. - Having mountains of content in each scene (ie: all npc's have unique monologue, secret rooms) - Providing clear direction for where to go next (d-pad up) - Making combat wicked fun. Towards the end, the story drags out for 30 minutes longer than needed, but they had genuine emotional content that needed closure.9/10 wiggles			"

												Ken Levine made an absolute master piece. A FPS game taking place in Columbia, which is a floating steampunk city, set in 1912 America, where you sent to find & rescue Elizabeth, fighting the Prophet's armies as Booker DeWitt. Elizabeth is your companion assisting you in combat throwing med kits, ammo & salt (she even finds money out of combat & unlocking doors with lockpicks). The end of the game was mind blowing. If you haven't played this game yet, just do it. A solid 10/10 (gameplay, storyline, graphics & music)			"

												I have to say that I had quite enjoyed my time playing this game. The core of the game itself was a fantastic experience. The story telling itself was in my opinion pretty great. As the player I was able to empathize with the protagonist quite easily. The scenery was really impressive and the graphics were phenomenal. The game itself takes a spinoff of some original American history and asks what could be if there really was a floating city. The soundtrack was really well done. However, there were a few downsides to the game also. The gameplay was quite linear, the codes that Elizabeth can break almost feel like you are going out of your way and unlocking the chests feels quite counterproductive also.  Unlike the previous games in the series, the choices you make don’t effect the end of the game. Instead if you choose to steal from a neutral area the only con is the NPC’s will become hostile and attack you. The ending was a bit confusing, however after searching up online it made more sense as to what was happening. Overall I would rate the game a 9/10. I would totally recommend this to all of my friends to try this out.			"

												AUUGH THE PLOTTWIST IS SO REAL! I CAN'T HANDLE IT!Seriously though, this game is amazing! The story is great, the plottwist at the end is fantastic, and the overall feel/atmosphere of the game just fits perfectly. The combat can get a bit stale and/or repetitive but the vigors and the weapons usually lead to a variety of ways you can go through each battle. As the plot thickens the more inclined you are to finish the game (especially knowing there is a plot-twist in the end). The closer you get to the end of the game you're in a state of ""I want to finish the game, but I don't want to finish the game 'cause I don't want it to end.""All in all, this game is WELL worth the cost, especially considering it gets 75% off during every major sale. Definitely worth your time :)			"

												A short summary of Bioshock Infinite from my point of view. The game was entertaining but not as captivating as I thought it would be. Don’t get me wrong, I loved the art style of the game, the story is superb, and combat can get pretty gritty when mixing powers+guns+melee attacks. On the same note, combat in Bioshock Infinite felt kind of repetitive and unnecessary at times I found myself losing interest in the overall game. There are times were combat is amazing and you are jumping from hook to hook or traveling on rails to get the jump on some enemies and you really feel like a character on a mission of retribution .  However in between these moments there are sequences where it is basically, enter area, lots of enemies spawn, kill enemies, move on, repeat. Though I did say the story is superb like combat it also has these moments where you don’t get any new character development or plot revelation and again kind of dragged down my interest.All that being said, the game is relatively long and the DLC burial at sea sets up the story for the original Bioshock nicely. So is it worth the non-sale price that is currently on steam? ($29.99 or $49.99+season pass) that is a hard question for me to answer. For just Bioshock Infinite I’d say $29.99 is definitely worth it because the main game content is definitely worth the asking price. However, the season pass is still a bit pricy and the dlc Burial at Sea episode 1 and 2 are really the only thing you actually might want (the other stuff is just something to help you upgrade your character).

												Synopsis: it's a magic world filled with a great deal of drama.It would be hard and unfair to describe the game just telling it's perfect in all possible aspects, the game (DLCs are included) is a quintessence of all Bioshock series. Yet I can't say that it's the best as all of Bioshock games are unique in its perfection.Binfinite is a masterpiece that's for sure. I'm not going to describe common features like top notch graphics etc. I just want to say that the game, if played correctly (no haste, plz), will tear you apart and drain emotionally as the plot is so deep and heart-touching. The game has perfect balance between action and story-telling, yet I would advice to replay it in a while to understand the plot deeply.It was a long journey for me to Bioshock series, and Binfinite was the pioneer for me, the successful pioneer. Thx Irrational Games, thx Ken Levine, thx to all the devs. It's a pleasure to play the games like this: beautiful, story-deep and perfect in everything.PS. 2 future players: would you kindly watch the cast till the end?PPS. Last but not least. Отдельное спасибо ребятам из CGInfo, которые проделали немалую работу по локализации игры, особенно за качественное озвучивание. Как для аматорского проекта - это просто бесценно. Спасибо!PPPS: ""Clash in the Clouds"" (arcade non-story DLC) is one hell of pain in the♥♥♥♥♥!!

												Synopsis: it's a magic world filled with a great deal of drama.It would be hard and unfair to describe the game just telling it's perfect in all possible aspects, the game (DLCs are included) is a quintessence of all Bioshock series. Yet I can't say that it's the best as all of Bioshock games are unique in its perfection.Binfinite is a masterpiece that's for sure. I'm not going to describe common features like top notch graphics etc. I just want to say that the game, if played correctly (no haste, plz), will tear you apart and drain emotionally as the plot is so deep and heart-touching. The game has perfect balance between action and story-telling, yet I would advice to replay it in a while to understand the plot deeply.It was a long journey for me to Bioshock series, and Binfinite was the pioneer for me, the successful pioneer. Thx Irrational Games, thx Ken Levine, thx to all the devs. It's a pleasure to play the games like this: beautiful, story-deep and perfect in everything.PS. 2 future players: would you kindly watch the cast till the end?PPS. Last but not least. Отдельное спасибо ребятам из CGInfo, которые проделали немалую работу по локализации игры, особенно за качественное озвучивание. Как для аматорского проекта - это просто бесценно. Спасибо!PPPS: ""Clash in the Clouds"" (arcade non-story DLC) is one hell of pain in the♥♥♥♥♥!! I ate my shoes until I was able to beat it for all the achievements :)Percent score: 100 + 1% out of 100%			"

												Think I prefer BioShock 1+2 and Rapture but this grows on you while being a nice change of environment and is certainly right up there. Things feel more streamlined and limited in comparison to previous entries but what is there and when its combined, is good.Took me about 22-23hrs for main campaign, starting the campaign DLCs at around the 25hrs mark and hoping more things will make sense (Think I get the ideas, just not sure I'm buying it or happy with its price so to speak) once I've completed it, overall about 8-9 out of 10.

												What a ride! This is a very story driven game so I won't get into details about story. I will say that it was a very interesting story and while I enjoyed it thoroughly I can see why other people didn't like it.Game play I thought was very fluid. You get a gun and shoot people and you have Vigors that help you with the fighting. While the Vigors were cool I only used a few of them regularly in combat. Also I found it easiest to just shoot people with a heavy weapon and kill them quickly without all the flash and style. Playing the game on the hardest difficulty I had a great amount of challenge, but every second was enjoyable and it wasn’t too hard. If you died it was on you. Granted there is an enemy who just lays down suppressive explosive fire, but you can always find a way to end that. Vigors help in that regard.The friendly AI in video games has always been a challenge to have fluidly run next to you throughout a story, but DAMN did they nail this! She was intriguing, she was helpful in that she stayed out of the line of fire, but gave me stuff to help fight also. All I can say is bravo! The team did an excellent job on this.I’m sitting here, as I write this, trying to find a fault in this game. Maybe the only conclusion is a deeper explanation of the story. Even then I feel that it wouldn’t matter. It would be interesting, but the question of whether it is needed lies with the beholder. For this game I give it the rare 10/10Bravo! What a fantastic game. I will replay in the near future!			"

 “Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt”Bioshock Infinite is the final game in its trilogy, but can frankly stand out as its own due to its original story. The story, the art style and the characters manage to charm the player from the first glance and keep them immersed in its universe.You follow the steps of Booker Dewitt, an american citizen with a mysterious that has been given a task to retrieve a girl that resides in a city in the clouds AKA Columbia. It may have seem as your everyday rescue mission, but the second he arrives to said city things take a little twist and the story will only become more and more complex as you make progress. One of the things I loved the most is your partner Elizabeth which, unlike many other companions, you don’t feel the burden to protect her all the time or just forget about her in the middle of a battle but will actually step out and help you with health, ammo and salts without having (while this can save you on many tricky situations you can’t by any means abuse that and have her carrying you over), later on she’ll learn to control an ability that allows to pull out certain elements to aid you further in combat. Whenever you’re out of combat and just exploring the corners of Columbia, let it be a side quest, looking for special gear or infusions to upgrade, you’ll notice that she’ll let you know about certain goodies that the player might miss out (lockpicks, a certain clue or money) proving that she’s far superior than most AI companions and personally I think that the developers just made a great job with her; you feel sympathy for her to the point that you form that special bond that not many characters can evoke.The soundtrack is one of the best I’ve seen in a long time, it combines some past era music with original scores that just blend beautifully in the atmosphere. One thing that I have seen many people doing is to compare this game to its previous installments, and I consider that if you want to get the best experience of it is to try to avoid that. While they may be in the same universe they are definitely not story related and the gameplay does changes a bit (nothing groundbreaking in my opinion though). Something that I would like to point out is that this is one of the best optimized games I’ve ever seen, I’ve had the opportunity of playing it in a laptop with the lowest graphics cards, if you can call it that (obviously the settings were in no way maxed butl medium to high) and it ran smoothly for most of the game.

												One of my favorite games of all time. Probably my favorite FPS. The art style, combat/gameplay, score, story, characters and themes are all so perfect. It does everything the previous BioShock games did but perhaps even better (in my opinion). The way the story unfolds really makes you care about Booker and Elizabeth's fates. The combat is so varied and full of options and the gun mechanics themselves feel so nice and smooth. The soundtrack adds a lot of tension in fights when needed or adds a lot of atmosphere in cut-scenes. Columbia is no Rapture, but it looks beautiful in its own right and fits the general aesthetic of 1912 America. Last but not least, this game tackles a lot of turn of the century themes of poverty, divided classes, segregation and racism that a lot of other games wouldn't because they don't have the balls. The only minor issue I see is that the game loses focus about halfway through and the story progresses through a bit of Deus Ex machina. 9/10. My only regret is not being able to experience the game for the first time again.			"

												By FAR...the best PC/Console series of this generation (as you can tell by my hours, I can't stop playing). BioShock is absolutely the most fascinating series I have played. From the original to infinite, it never seems to not please the player. It is a must buy, and a must play. However, make sure you start from the original BioShock to understand what is going on in infinite. 10/10, would play numerous amount of times, as I have done already.			"

												Hello boys and girls, step right up and experience Bioshock Infinite - The one and only video game to feature graphics that appear more stunning than the graphics in real life! That's right graphics-obsessed mainstream gamer crowd, get your salivary glands as hyped up as the fanboys of this here game, because you're in for the ride of your lives through the first literal shooter on rails!Yes, you heard me right - this game is the first shooter on rails to actually involve shooting while on rails! As you glide gracefully through the air without ever fearing for your life, you will find yourself pitted against fellow rail-riders that will also be firing at you as you fire at them. But don't worry! This game is more than ready to account for your lack of an attention span, and will gladly reduce the odds of you getting shot while riding on these rails to next to zero!Be prepared to be awed by this game's incredible involvement of the theory of relativity, which will leave you, like many fanboys, baffled and confused with its remarkable ending that completely forgets the grandfather paradox! But don't question the lack of thought put into its use of time and space, nor how people can live in a floating city like this without passing out from low oxygen! None of this should matter when you're rapidly firing a rocket launcher, and being hit in the head with a wrench by a girl you just saved!But graphics aren't all this game features, it also boasts amazing features never seen before in video game history! Features, such as; Racism, skyhook assassinations, firefights on rails (as mentioned before, but it's worth repeating!), classical music, crazy religious people, and most of all: Elizabeth's magical ability to pull weapons and money from thin air!Mainstream shooter fans rejoice! This game, unlike the others in the franchise, realizes that you're too simple-minded to possibly keep up with multiple weapons, and so it limits you to only two at once! Don't worry about figuring out which two weapons you like - they've gone out of their way to make sure that only a small portion of the handful of weapons available are actually useful in the game, so you'll be just fine!So throw your science book out the window, forget Einstein existed, and prepare to enter the floating city of Columbia through the eyes of Booker Dewitt, he's just your average ex-military gun-wielding father who is able to immediately go from retrieving a girl for a 100% legit client, to taking on an entire army of soldiers! Become immersed in his epic tale, as he rescues a Paris-obsessed girl named Elizabeth, who shows absolutely no respect for our clearly trustworthy protagonist, and will not think twice about running away, or otherwise physically harming him, despite the fact that he is the only reason she ever escaped at all!So join the hype train, and buy Bioshock Infinite - your eyes will not regret it, but your mind might!

												*Note, I have not played any other bioshock gamesBioshock infinite has a good story, great graphics. This game seriously lacks in gunplay and mechanics. This game doesn't have any replayability and is fairly short. You can finish this game in 9 hours, maybe a bit more if you do sidequests. Also this game is pretty easy on normal difficulty (thats the hardest difficulty in the game by the way)However don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this game. I just  don't think its a really good game. So if you want story and graphics, youre fine. If you like shooting things like a person without a mind go buy this game. if you really like in depth-mechanics and gunplay go buy another game. Also I don't give score because you can't give criticism in a number.			"

												Having just completed this game, I feel it's time to recommend it to other people, point out why, and also point out the flaws you should be aware of before you take to the forums.I erect raise a wall of text in memory of my recent playthrough. Scroll right to the bottom for TL;DR version.Bioshock Infinite is an impressive, immersive world with a story that will swallow you in and ultimately decrease your productivity at work/college. Although it can suck you in, play-time is relatively short, as I completed it in 18 hours (two days of gameplay) - and that's with me going to explore and check out the obscure areas (and waiting at an ""Arrival/Departure"" sign for about half an hour lol).Not long after you start this game, about the time you end up in Columbia, you're met with a feeling of euphoria and you find yourself exploring, asking questions like ""Where does this path lead?"", ""Can I talk to this guy?"" and ""Who on Earth keeps a pear inside a cash register?"".Combat is great, and despite being a story-driven game the action is constant and exciting. Enemies die - they don't flop and hit the ground like in some games. You hear a sort of epic-orchestra-hit when you kill someone from a headshot (this is amazing during a certain fight in the Shantytown when you're popping head after head as you lea---). Sorry, spoiler police.You'll find yourself seamlessly ducking in and out of cover, shooting faces, throwing enemies off the edge, speeding across skylines, diving through the air, and lots of other cool stuff you can't do in real life or Call of Duty.Though this game isn't without its flaws - my major beef being with the rushed finish. About halfway through the game, you begin to notice repeated textures, chalkboards with the exact same combinations of formulae you've saw in a hundred other places (fellow engineering graduates - you'll notice this instantly), as if this one scientist works for all of Columbia.Choices don't make much difference, and while we should be glad that the story is kept on the rails at all times, it would be nice to have a more interactive world - maybe with some distractions from the story, some immersive side-quests, some random people we can empathise with (preferably who don't all look exactly the same). Maybe I'm asking this game to be something it's not - but you DID get my hopes up at the beginning.Special tip for the best experience: Don't play through this game in two days like I did. Space it out. The environment can get repetitive.Now for the TL;DR version...Good: Epic story, beautiful environment, accurate portrayal of historical attitudes and events, action-packed, fast-paced combat, fitting soundtrack, fair balance between players freedom and integrity of storyline, female companion to ease loneliness of sitting in front of your computer all day.Bad: Noticeable repitition of mid-priority textures (i.e. chalkboards, picture frames, decorations), leaves you with the cold realisation that you were playing a game all this time.I rate this game 9/10 and implore you to play it - whether you liked the first two or not, this is an amazing game.

The ending is wow, so good, seriously really good. This is in my top 10 best games ever list, and that's saying a lot considering I have played a lot of games.

												I had never before played any game from the Bioshock franchise, nor even seen one played. Other than having heard the name, I had no clue about the concept, story, genre, or game play style. I bought Bioshock Infinite for $1. My kids were silenced into disbelief when they saw it in my library. I had no idea what to expect.What can I say? I'm in shock and awe. Spectacular.A unique story-driven FPS, Bioshock Infinite is stunningly beautiful, yet surprisingly creepy and disturbing. I'm still not altogether sure wtf is happening or what I'm supposed to be doing, but I have superpowers and it looks amazing!Well done to the development team. 10/10 Highly Recommended.			"

												An awesome game with an epic story, with an unexpected plot twist at the end. The graphics style is also epic, and I didn't notice any low-res or repeated textures throughout the whole of my play. The gun play is very good and I would recommend this to anyone if you are willing to accept a very linear story. Although the levels are fairly linear towards the beginning of the game, they start to open up more later, though I still think the levels should be more open and give you more ways to tackle a situation. There is a very basic stealth system, however it is only really used once throughout the whole game.The game took me about 8-9 hours to finish.			"

												I haver to admit my opinion about this games is higly positive and mixed. What was a huge improvement is that it's first Bioshock that have a storyline, to the extent that I felt that all that shooting is not a main part of the game, but rather annoying distraction from a good story. Don't get me wrong, it's huge. If you play a game and you feel there is a good story that you want to follow and it's AAA title, it's the way it should be. However if someone is looking into Modern Warfare kind of storyline, nope, wrong title. Mood, look and feel, probably best female character since Alyx in Half Life 2, effort put by designers to create rich, highely detailed environment it's all great. So where's that mixed part? It's about storyline itself. It's like David Lynch has rewritten Butterfly Effect movie while taking strong psychoactive drugs. After finishing game probably first thing you will do is google: Bioshock Infinite storyline (google autosuggest: 'explained'). This is not in my opinion good thing. On the other hand part of me thinks that without such weird plot, there would not be such touching and emotionally loaded ending.I absolutely recommend, however if you looking for best game ever. It's just not yet there.			"

												My opinion for this game is a... complicated one, so if you don't care for specifics, just take it as positive.As someone that has been a diehard fan of the Bioshock series ever since its conception, I can't consider this game an addition to the series, and not because it's not (primarily) set in Rapture, but because it doesn't hold any common ground with any game containing ""shock"" that was headed by Ken Levine.The weapons, unlike its predecessors, are lackluster and dull, with the majority of them being useless, or phased out by far more viable guns (try finding some footage of this game where somebody isn't just using the carbine and hand cannon).The ""tonics"" by far feel like the weakest thing about the game, with all but 2-3 of them feeling worthless, and unlike the other games, the use for them to access secret areas containing additional audio logs and loot are very sparse.Now, for the additional game mechanics.The lockpick ""system"" (if you can bare over glorifying this poorly-implemented gimmick to call it that) is atrocious, and because they couldn't be ♥♥♥♥ed to think of a new hacking minigame, they just added the occasional safe or door that requires the use of your precious and rare ""lockpicks"" to find out whether or not you just got screwed over because you spent all of them opening a door to reveal some ammo that you already maxxed out on, you may see a safe up ahead that requires only 2 and without a shadow of a doubt holds some of the best loot in the game. All in all, barely thought-out and dissapointing.The Elizabeth system is trivial and dumb, and they only put it in to make the game not seem like an escort quest. The level design could have been exactly the same and it would've been fine if they just implemented the occasional hook every here-and-there, and would actually encourage the player to fan out further in order to find supplies.Sidequests- eh.The skyrails were very well done, but incredibly underused, and just came across as another gimmick to be used in a level every now-and-then.The story? Alot of people harp on about how this game has an excellent tale, with a strong supporting lore, but I would heavily disagree, even the background story provided through audio logs in Bioshock 2 (The strongest and most underrated aspect of that game, by the way) is more solid and integral than that of this game. The multi-dimensional aspect of the story is mind-mushingly simple, especially considering what they could've done with it, and I feel that it is an insult to the saga, and a disappointment after Minerva's Den for 2. Another nitpick is that when Elizabeth is supposedly depressed and undergoing complete psychological trauma, she still has it in her to yell a whimsical comment as she throws you some ammo or picks a lock. The alleged and critically acclaimed ""twists"" in it feel incredibly predictible.Character Progression- Tonics get really dull and uninteresting upgrades. There is no system similar to that of the Little Sisters. The weapon upgrades dullness is second only to that of the weapons themselves. You can only hold 2 weapons. The only remnants of the moral choice system showcased in the original display of the early version of this game is at the very beginning, and has no impact at all.As much as I've been harping on it, this is still a good game. Just not a good -----Shock game. Although many of these issues are fixed the Burial at Sea expansion pack, they still aren't part of the base game, which is by far what really counts. I thoroughly recommend this game, though you may want to pick it up at a discount...			"

												I love the original Bioshock; I played the original one on the Xbox 360, and it was one of the best single player game I have ever played. It was so cleverly made... the morality elements and story was the most compelling part about it. In Bioshock Infinite, they refreshed these factors very well much like the original (I haven't played Bioshock II yet). This game feels very, very much like the original Bioshock, but at the same time, it feels like a different game. The team that made Infinite completely redesigned the game; goodbye plasmids, we now have Vigors. No more ""hacking"", but there's possession, which does something similar. No more carrying an armory of weapons (Which kind of saddens me; you can now only carry 2 guns now), but you have an amazing partner (Elizabeth) that tosses you ammo, health, and salts (Which replaces EVE and powers vigors) when you need it. The story is very indepth, even more so than the original. I would highly recommend taking you're time while playing this game; If you just rush through it like a regular shooters game, you are TOTALLY missing the point of Bioshock. The audio logs and story just makes this game feels so complete. Not just that, the combat mechanism is fun as well and balanced. If you really enjoyed the original Bioshock, then this game will not disappoint you. PS. Elizabeth is the best NPC I have played with in a game... I think I'm in love with her.			"

												I've played Bioshock 2 and Infinite in a row. I've got the feeling that the later one was ... umm ... lost in translation. Taking action, form underwater Rapture into sky-city Columbia, compared to everything else, was actually a minor change. All (System/Bio)Shock games were centered around careful planning and resources management. To take down enemy You had to play smart. Here You have to … just play. At least on Normal difficulty. Nothing in this game (maybe beside final stage) will give You any problems at all. There is plenty ammunition/health/salt laying around. Enemies are weak and stupid. Just go gun blazing and You will be fine. I did not feel any need to actually upgrade my   weapons / vigors (I did it only for achievements). Of course You can always change difficulty setting but this will not change the fact that fight are chaotic mess that allows very little planning. On the plus side graphics are very nice (but optimization could be better, my overclocked GFX580 had problems here and there), plot is quite good, Elizabeth as character is nice but ending is a little bit disappointing. To sum it up: decent movie but a little bit weak game.			"

												I have a group of friends I grew up with, and they were really into obscure movies. I remember them raving about some movie called Donny Darko. I watched it and thought, wtf is this, this is some real artistics steaming bull crap. I mean, it had some good points but man, you really have to be into movies and sci fi and weird stuff to get into that movie. Then inception came along. I thought it was decent you know, good computer graphics, spinny worlds, spoiler alert: twist. I guess where I'm going here is that both these movies are major hype artistic crap with the twist being the main seller. Now, if we talk about games, this is where I bought put bioshock infinite. The gameplay mechanics are ok. Nothing revolutionary here. The graphics are ok. I think everything is ok and well within the 30-40 dollar price tag. But the story is what you pay your admission for. And yeah, if you liked Donny Darko, Inception then probably this is for you. It also helps to have played bioshock 1 and 2.			"

												Bioshock Infinite is some people's game of the year. An interesting setting is wasted to tell an incoherent story. The gunplay is shallow, the enemies are absolute bullet sponges, and the superpowers are necessary to use- even if they're a chore and there's never enough juice to use them. Also, Quantum Mechanics is, despite the game's apparent belief, not magic.			"

												While my feelings for Bioshock: Infinite are a bit mixed I do recommend that you check this game out.Compared to Bioshock (1) the Vigors (plasmids) and weapons don't feel nearly as inspired.  There are less overall Vigors than in 1 and they seemed all around less useful than the plasmids of Bioshock.  The effects are minimal and I never felt like they contributed much in combat aside from minor effects like stunning an enemy or increasing how much damage the baddies took, which is a shame really.  Elsewhere, there are more types of guns but the amount of customization is much more limited.  There are no longer multiple ammo types and the weapon mods (upgrades) are very strict: each gun has 4 unique upgrades that unlock as you progress through the game but must be purchased.  Finally, tonics are mostly replaced by a new mechanic called Gear.  Gear can be changed at any time and confers similar effects to tonics.  Four pieces of gear can be worn at one time, but these pieces fill specific slots (hat body legs boots).  The effects of gear seemed to be expanded upon past the tonics of Bioshock.As a warning this game is very story heavy.  The pacing is much slower at the start than it is in Bioshock and this is both good and bad.  I didn't feel like I was playing a game for a long time, and even after I was the actual gameplay was so divided by long story segments that I wondered if the gameplay was getting in the way of the story that Infinite wanteed to tell.  This clears up about a third to halfway into the game but that's a long time before it actually happens.That being said I did enjoy the story even if it did get a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ty near the end.  While it's not the most original I applaud that the themes and ideas present were used in a video game, at least until the very end.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the ending but it seemed a bit contrived, defying sense and logic.  It did make me want to go replay the game and understand the significance of everything, but eh, lazy.  Ah, and the characters are fantastic as are there interactions.Combat is more or less the same as it was in Bioshock: you shoot things and then they die.  The enemy that replaced the Big Daddy is terrifying but it also only shows up a few times within the story.  Normal enemies make a lot more sense in Infinite than they did in Bioshock.  I understood why I was fighting what I was and why they were there/attacking me in 1 but the enemies in Infinite just fit a lot better.  Later ""normal"" enemies infuriated me at times because they would take more than an entire clip to their face at point blank before they would go down, but whatever, you get over it.The sky line system is interesting but I would have liked to see it expanded a bit more as it rarely comes into play.  Sure, in some combat situations it opens up the battlefield a lot and creates for some cool moments but I never felt like the sky lines were fully implemented.  That is to say, they felt out of place in their own game: their existence in a lot of places didn't make a lot of sense and from a story point they didn't seem to frequent or connect enough areas.  Early on you use them to move from one area to another but after that they mostly stay confined to a battle arena.  Shame, really.Oh, and the game is gorgeous.  The setting is ok; if it had been more open I would have received it better than I did, but you're never really given an opportunity to explore.  Everything is linear and you see exactly what the developers want you to.  Because of the linearity I didn't feel like I was exploring a city in the clouds so much.  In fact, I felt more confined in Infinite than I ever did in Bioshock, though maybe that is partially due to the ability to backtrack.  Ah well.Yeah, Bioshock is a good game, possibily even great, but it's not without flaws.  You should almost certainly check it out and it's definitely a game that's worth talking about.			"

												2/10 and for good reason.- terrible story: the developers are too lazy to create a logical story and decided to fill every plot hole with 'OOH LOOK TIME TRAVEL ALTERNATE DIMENSIONS"" and attempt to justify their reason because science. Well, I'm sorry to say that everything they did in this game is completely wrong and the fact rings true here that just because you have a complex story doesn't mean it's good. The game is so poorly written that I was wondering how it got so many rave reviews- gameplay: quite possibly the most generic fps gameplay I have ever seen. run in, shoot generic bad guys, leave, repeat. BORING. What happened to plasmids and how they were a major plot point on the first two games? replaced with plasmids that aren't explained at all and fill the, again, generic role of powerups. - characters: booker is just another pasty emo kid who wants attention because he's distraught for losing his daughter to comstock. Elizabeth isn't much better, especially since her role is lockpicking and throwing booker guns. Also yelling booker alot, which gets annoying as hell. oh and she's booker's daughter, which was totally not obvious by the beginning of the game *wink wink nudge nudge*Overall, a generic, blatant call of duty ripoff with pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ character development and an overly complex story that not only makes no sense scientifically, fails as a story.

												I came onto BioShock Infinite fresh after making a final run at the second in the series, and was not entirely sure what to expect with this new outing.  I knew the setting had changed, but a number of the core gameplay mechanics had made the jump from the first two games. What greeted me though was something a bit different than I could have anticipated, in ways that grew on me very quickly.  The first impression was holy crap wow this is a beautiful game.  The first two were interesting, visually, more for their art stylings than actual tech, but they never really blew me away.  Within the first 5 minutes of infinite with all the settings 'turned to 11' so to speak, my jaw was pretty much on the floor.  Its not that they are technically doing something wholly new I haven't seen before, but that what they are doing is just simply done out and out superlatively.  The lighting mixed with the beautiful texturing, mixed with the motion of the air city all around you just really scratched a visual itch in a way that say, Far Cry 2, and Fl0wer for the ps3 had previously.  Just really high on the wow factor.Beyond the sheer visuals though, I was immediately and pleasantly surprised by how 'tight' the controlls felt.  One of the bigger criticisms of the first two BioShock games is that they were 'console first' designs with controls clearly meant for a gamepad, and they felt sluggish and un-responsive to a seasoned mouse and keyboard user.  Infinite could not be further from that, and it was immediately noticable.  The mouse was perfectly smooth and responsive in the way the top tier valve titles tend to be, and things coming over from consoles really never seem to hit.This also ties in very well with much *much* tighter combat.   The weapons feel powerful and generally satisfying, you are limited halo-like to only having two around at a time, so you generally have to think ahead.  Do you really want to walk into a giant mansion with tons of tight corridors and rooms with a sniper rifle, or would it maybe make more sense to swap it out for something a little faster and more mobile first?The 'powers' (aka magic sparkles that fly out of your hand and into an enemies face) take something of a back-seat this time compared to gun play, and I appreciated the changes.  The fighting in rapture in the original games felt more like a game of tic-tac-toe than actual combat.  You had to zap the right enemies with the right magic in the right order then shoot them.  Sans magic you might as well have been firing rubber bullets.  You can make it though a signigicant part of this game barely using the powers at all, or you can use them more tactically, augmenting your fighting style in appreciable and welcome ways, vs out-right dictating it to you.Also for once, your 'escort mission' is the *best* part of the game, not the worst.  Its almost cliche at this point that you have to do x and y and protect the girl or you lose and its game over would you like to retry and maybe take more of the bullets this time so your npc can skip through unscathed... and yeah.. not here, not at all.  It feels like working *with* someone, not for them, and they are wholly capable of managing themselves, and maybe even getting you the extra cover you need, etc.  The only remaining question is why has it taken 15 years for the 'gaming world' to get it this right?There are in the end a few rough edges, sometimes you can feel a little directionless, there is always a helpful arrow to show you where you 'should' go, and you can of course follow it to the end, but theres so much more going on in the game, and the levels are so huge at times that you just sort of feel helpless trying to complete all the little side quests and secrets.  a 'second playthrough' sort of 'new game plus' option would have been pretty welcome here too, as no matter *how* good you are, you are never going to be able to earn/buy/achieve everything on a single play-through.  Those are quibbles tho, a rough plastic seam on a brand new toy, annoying, but no deal breakers by any means.(9.5/10)			"

												First off. The gameplay felt like Halo 1- Which would be good, except that it isnt Halo..... and also none of the previous games limited your number of weapons and tactical versatility. The fights were all about the same and the game was too easy, even on the hardest difficulty.Next. The art style. While steampunk is pretty cool, these guys look like they were ripped from some anime instead of a mysterious unseen part of the world. I mean, who the hell hauls around a coffin on his back while trying to engage in melee? (It would have made so much sense if that were a machinegun with the ammo belt feeding into it.)Which brings me to the next point- weapons. Submachine guns werent even invented in the time period this game takes place in. The sky hook somehow allows one to leap like a (anime) ninja and somehow has the horsepower to pull off some guy's head. Though i will give a little leeway to those because a fair deal of technology in this we don't even have a grasp of today. Though as far as the advancements in tech go....THIS GAME DUN' GOOFED.OK. How are you able to just change your genetic code so easily? In Bioshock 1, it was EXTENSIVELY detailed about how ADAM adds volatile extra code to your genes for you to add plasmids onto. For infinite. No sir. And what makes plasmids so magical in 1960 when we have had ""vigors"" all this time? Don't give me ""quantum science""as an answer because that is as good as saying, ""magic"". ""Magic is why"" also seems to be the reason I can do bonus damage on headshots because I put on a new pair of pants. When did bioshock become TF2? At the very least. TF2 doesn't strive to be more than a fun game. BS Infinite seems to be trying to push some abstract political agenda towards us while clutching at straws trying to be as deep or phillosophical as its predecessors. The characters had sketchy backstories and Booker was abrasive, making it rather hard for me to like him and making it that much harder to enjoy when I am portraying a guy that is kind of a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Elizabeth seems to sometimes put up with him- at the very least helping out in combat and providing a deus ex machina every time you are out of ammo or near death- until Booker messes up again and does something that pisses the girl off. She has this Mary Sue power to open portals to almost anything and anywhere but never has the guts to go through them. She never gets injured and always has some reason to come back to Booker in spite of the obviously selfish intent he has.All in all. This is not the genetically enhanced shooter like from 2007. It is sadly quite overrated. Say what you will, critics have gone soft these days, man up. I havent much else more.			"

												After the ""somewhat"" letdown of Bioshock 2, Infinite sets the path straight once again for the franchise. Expect a good story with some twists, the same solid combat mechanics as before (plasmids included) and visually stunning levels. But the biggest addition is the best-to-date designed companion NPC (Elizabeth). Her model-animation, voice and personality are a true landmark in gaming.On the downside, it's a bit short and lacks replayability, but the great overall quality makes up for it.  "

												I suppose It would be great game around 2004 because of outstanding graphic. But the whole story is not very entertaining, despite the shocking (and for me very sick) final discovery. It makes me feel that the storywriter in the end did not know how resolve whole situation. Even the mechanic of shooting was boring. I didn´t enjoy fights, it felt somehow strange and meretricious.

												First off. The gameplay felt like Halo 1- Which would be good, except that it isnt Halo..... and also none of the previous games limited your number of weapons and tactical versatility. The fights were all about the same and the game was too easy, even on the hardest difficulty.Next. The art style. While steampunk is pretty cool, these guys look like they were ripped from some anime instead of a mysterious unseen part of the world. I mean, who the hell hauls around a coffin on his back while trying to engage in melee? (It would have made so much sense if that were a machinegun with the ammo belt feeding into it.)Which brings me to the next point- weapons. Submachine guns werent even invented in the time period this game takes place in. The sky hook somehow allows one to leap like a (anime) ninja and somehow has the horsepower to pull off some guy's head. Though i will give a little leeway to those because a fair deal of technology in this we don't even have a grasp of today. Though as far as the advancements in tech go....THIS GAME DUN' GOOFED.OK. How are you able to just change your genetic code so easily? In Bioshock 1, it was EXTENSIVELY detailed about how ADAM adds volatile extra code to your genes for you to add plasmids onto. For infinite. No sir. And what makes plasmids so magical in 1960 when we have had ""vigors"" all this time? Don't give me ""quantum science""as an answer because that is as good as saying, ""magic"". ""Magic is why"" also seems to be the reason I can do bonus damage on headshots because I put on a new pair of pants. When did bioshock become TF2? At the very least. TF2 doesn't strive to be more than a fun game. BS Infinite seems to be trying to push some abstract political agenda towards us while clutching at straws trying to be as deep or phillosophical as its predecessors. The characters had sketchy backstories and Booker was abrasive, making it rather hard for me to like him and making it that much harder to enjoy when I am portraying a guy that is kind of a♥♥♥♥♥♥ Elizabeth seems to sometimes put up with him- at the very least helping out in combat and providing a deus ex machina every time you are out of ammo or near death- until Booker messes up again and does something that pisses the girl off. She has this Mary Sue power to open portals to almost anything and anywhere but never has the guts to go through them. She never gets injured and always has some reason to come back to Booker in spite of the obviously selfish intent he has.All in all. This is not the genetically enhanced shooter like from 2007. It is sadly quite overrated. Say what you will, critics have gone soft these days, man up. I havent much else more.			"

												I've played all of the BioShock series leading up to this and I don't know what this is.  It seems that some BioShock elements were used to develop a limited, hokey shooter with silly elements added to it that have nothing to do with BioShock 1 and 2.  Furthermore, the context of the story is unnecessary, unappreciated and quite distasteful (racism...really?).  I found it sheds some negative light on our Founding Fathers, early 20th Century American society and the history of the United States albeit in some ""attempted"" humorous fashion.  I'm sure this will prove enormously entertaining to the console kiddies (hence the good reviews) with all the flashy bloom lighting effects and roller-coaster rides through the sky; but for any seasoned gamers looking for an experience anywhere near BioShock 1 and 2...forget it.  The content is just not there. I'm starting to get a bit leery of 2K Games releases.To sum it all up; if you're looking for a continuation of the epic BioShock 1 and 2 series, this isn't it.  It's a rip-off from the coattails of the former two; much like a horrible ""part 3"" of an otherwise fantastic movie series that wasn't written or directed by the team of the first two.  The only reason I'm playing through this is because I bought it...thankfully on sale.			"

One of the greatest effects was the lighting as it made the game look really nice and at times you just have to stand and take in the view.StoryThis is the element of the game that absolutely blew my mind. While the story's core principle is simple, throughout the game there are many twists and turns which makes the story very interesting. Once you get to the end of the game it will leave you with both questions and answers which is both annoying and great.This is definitely a game that everyone should pick up if they are into first person shooters!

												I came onto BioShock Infinite fresh after making a final run at the second in the series, and was not entirely sure what to expect with this new outing.  I knew the setting had changed, but a number of the core gameplay mechanics had made the jump from the first two games. What greeted me though was something a bit different than I could have anticipated, in ways that grew on me very quickly.  The first impression was holy crap wow this is a beautiful game.  The first two were interesting, visually, more for their art stylings than actual tech, but they never really blew me away.  Within the first 5 minutes of infinite with all the settings 'turned to 11' so to speak, my jaw was pretty much on the floor.  Its not that they are technically doing something wholly new I haven't seen before, but that what they are doing is just simply done out and out superlatively.  The lighting mixed with the beautiful texturing, mixed with the motion of the air city all around you just really scratched a visual itch in a way that say, Far Cry 2, and Fl0wer for the ps3 had previously.  Just really high on the wow factor.Beyond the sheer visuals though, I was immediately and pleasantly surprised by how 'tight' the controlls felt.  One of the bigger criticisms of the first two BioShock games is that they were 'console first' designs with controls clearly meant for a gamepad, and they felt sluggish and un-responsive to a seasoned mouse and keyboard user.  Infinite could not be further from that, and it was immediately noticable.  The mouse was perfectly smooth and responsive in the way the top tier valve titles tend to be, and things coming over from consoles really never seem to hit.This also ties in very well with much *much* tighter combat.   The weapons feel powerful and generally satisfying, you are limited halo-like to only having two around at a time, so you generally have to think ahead.  Do you really want to walk into a giant mansion with tons of tight corridors and rooms with a sniper rifle, or would it maybe make more sense to swap it out for something a little faster and more mobile first?The 'powers' (aka magic sparkles that fly out of your hand and into an enemies face) take something of a back-seat this time compared to gun play, and I appreciated the changes.  The fighting in rapture in the original games felt more like a game of tic-tac-toe than actual combat.  You had to zap the right enemies with the right magic in the right order then shoot them.  Sans magic you might as well have been firing rubber bullets.  You can make it though a signigicant part of this game barely using the powers at all, or you can use them more tactically, augmenting your fighting style in appreciable and welcome ways, vs out-right dictating it to you.Also for once, your 'escort mission' is the *best* part of the game, not the worst.  Its almost cliche at this point that you have to do x and y and protect the girl or you lose and its game over would you like to retry and maybe take more of the bullets this time so your npc can skip through unscathed... and yeah.. not here, not at all.  It feels like working *with* someone, not for them, and they are wholly capable of managing themselves, and maybe even getting you the extra cover you need, etc.  The only remaining question is why has it taken 15 years for the 'gaming world' to get it this right?There are in the end a few rough edges, sometimes you can feel a little directionless, there is always a helpful arrow to show you where you 'should' go, and you can of course follow it to the end, but theres so much more going on in the game, and the levels are so huge at times that you just sort of feel helpless trying to complete all the little side quests and secrets.  a 'second playthrough' sort of 'new game plus' option would have been pretty welcome here too, as no matter *how* good you are, you are never going to be able to earn/buy/achieve everything on a single play-through.  Those are quibbles tho, a rough plastic seam on a brand new toy, annoying, but no deal breakers by any means.(9.5/10)			"

												I have a group of friends I grew up with, and they were really into obscure movies. I remember them raving about some movie called Donny Darko. I watched it and thought, wtf is this, this is some real artistics steaming bull crap. I mean, it had some good points but man, you really have to be into movies and sci fi and weird stuff to get into that movie. Then inception came along. I thought it was decent you know, good computer graphics, spinny worlds, spoiler alert: twist. I guess where I'm going here is that both these movies are major hype artistic crap with the twist being the main seller. Now, if we talk about games, this is where I bought put bioshock infinite. The gameplay mechanics are ok. Nothing revolutionary here. The graphics are ok. I think everything is ok and well within the 30-40 dollar price tag. But the story is what you pay your admission for. And yeah, if you liked Donny Darko, Inception then probably this is for you. It also helps to have played bioshock 1 and 2.			"

												While my feelings for Bioshock: Infinite are a bit mixed I do recommend that you check this game out.Compared to Bioshock (1) the Vigors (plasmids) and weapons don't feel nearly as inspired.  There are less overall Vigors than in 1 and they seemed all around less useful than the plasmids of Bioshock.  The effects are minimal and I never felt like they contributed much in combat aside from minor effects like stunning an enemy or increasing how much damage the baddies took, which is a shame really.  Elsewhere, there are more types of guns but the amount of customization is much more limited.  There are no longer multiple ammo types and the weapon mods (upgrades) are very strict: each gun has 4 unique upgrades that unlock as you progress through the game but must be purchased.  Finally, tonics are mostly replaced by a new mechanic called Gear.  Gear can be changed at any time and confers similar effects to tonics.  Four pieces of gear can be worn at one time, but these pieces fill specific slots (hat body legs boots).  The effects of gear seemed to be expanded upon past the tonics of Bioshock.As a warning this game is very story heavy.  The pacing is much slower at the start than it is in Bioshock and this is both good and bad.  I didn't feel like I was playing a game for a long time, and even after I was the actual gameplay was so divided by long story segments that I wondered if the gameplay was getting in the way of the story that Infinite wanteed to tell.  This clears up about a third to halfway into the game but that's a long time before it actually happens.That being said I did enjoy the story even if it did get a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ty near the end.  While it's not the most original I applaud that the themes and ideas present were used in a video game, at least until the very end.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the ending but it seemed a bit contrived, defying sense and logic.  It did make me want to go replay the game and understand the significance of everything, but eh, lazy.  Ah, and the characters are fantastic as are there interactions.Combat is more or less the same as it was in Bioshock: you shoot things and then they die.  The enemy that replaced the Big Daddy is terrifying but it also only shows up a few times within the story.  Normal enemies make a lot more sense in Infinite than they did in Bioshock.  I understood why I was fighting what I was and why they were there/attacking me in 1 but the enemies in Infinite just fit a lot better.  Later ""normal"" enemies infuriated me at times because they would take more than an entire clip to their face at point blank before they would go down, but whatever, you get over it.The sky line system is interesting but I would have liked to see it expanded a bit more as it rarely comes into play.  Sure, in some combat situations it opens up the battlefield a lot and creates for some cool moments but I never felt like the sky lines were fully implemented.  That is to say, they felt out of place in their own game: their existence in a lot of places didn't make a lot of sense and from a story point they didn't seem to frequent or connect enough areas.  Early on you use them to move from one area to another but after that they mostly stay confined to a battle arena.  Shame, really.Oh, and the game is gorgeous.  The setting is ok; if it had been more open I would have received it better than I did, but you're never really given an opportunity to explore.  Everything is linear and you see exactly what the developers want you to.  Because of the linearity I didn't feel like I was exploring a city in the clouds so much.  In fact, I felt more confined in Infinite than I ever did in Bioshock, though maybe that is partially due to the ability to backtrack.  Ah well.Yeah, Bioshock is a good game, possibily even great, but it's not without flaws.  You should almost certainly check it out and it's definitely a game that's worth talking about.			"

												I went into this with high expectations from what I've heard.  The visual design, the story, the graphics, the soundtrack, dialogue/voice acting, the atmosphere are all 10/10.  As a cinematic experience, it's unforgettable and top notch.  When I started playing it, I remember reading that a lot of people saw the game as a huge anti-Mormon/LDS experience & that came back.  The game takes place in 1912, in the floating city of Columbia.  Post Civil War America is a growing super power, heavy themes of racism, worker oppression, big business, anti-foreigner & religious revivalism are going on with some elements of Greek mythology like the first 2 Bioshocks.  The main villain is 1/2 Joseph Smith & 1/2 Brigham Young.The actual gameplay is solid, nothing spectacular or amazing.  I played through on 1999 mode and barely used the vigors which is supposed to be a big draw in the Bioshock world.  I used Shock Jockey for stun, but everything else is basically worthless.  Then you get to the final boss fight & HAVE to use a lot of vigors, so my build made it really hard.  I like the damage numbers & critical strikes popping up on enemies like in Borderlands to see how much HP they have though.  1999 mode wasn't really that hard except for about 2 parts.  There is a recycled boss fight 3 times and a lot of Handyman (read: Big Daddy) fights, the gameplay didn't innovate much and was as long as it was for the sake of story, not because they had that many gameplay ideas.For the Season Pass, Clash in the Clouds is just a boring challenge map DLC.  It's just waves of enemies & blue ribbon challenges.  Only play it if you care about achievements.  Burial at Sea is a 2 hour story campaign that ties into the main game, but takes you to 1958 Rapture, just before the events of Bioshock 1.  It actually adds a lot to the story & is very worth playing.  As of now, I know they're coming out with Burial at Sea part 2, but I don't know if anything else is coming for it or not.Of the 3 Bioshocks, Infinite definitely has the best story & art design, but Bioshock 2 was the most fun for me.  I can appreciate Infinite tying into the previous stories in a unique way & the DLC adds to the story more.Final Verdict: 8.5/10  Definitely worth playing through, but just a bit over rated for average gameplay.

												[Comrade's 2013 Experience of the Year]After playing the game through its entirety, I was left in awe.Both this game's setting and story are simply amazing, however the only actual negative was some of the gameplay itself. The environments were great, of course, but the actual weapons felt... weak and enemies became too bullet-spongy later on in the game. Elizabeth is a pretty interesting addition, as she runs around looking for stuff you're running low on in the middle of combat which saved my♥♥♥♥♥plenty of times. Though interesting she's almost the only actual face-to-face interaction you get beyond a few non-combat areas. And the vigors were... well they were alright but mostly ripped from the previous Bioshock. It was the gun-play which was really disappointing. Things like only being able to carry two weapons pretty much forces you to carry a gun and a heavy weapon. Plus weapons have very little kick and the bulletspongy enemies make it feel like you're using a toy gun. At the end of the game ammo is very scarce and there are no vendors you can get ammo from at all. And really, it just felt terrible at points, I found myself wanting to just get combat over with just to get back to the amazing story.I'd say its definitely worth a buy, as this is easily among the best stories ever told in a game.

												NO SPOILERThe game in one word: AWESOME. The story setting is just breathtaking, the colors are very vivid and everything is combined with a very nice soundtrack, which will shake your heart and will let you fell a thrill in your spine. The story is so complex and hard to understand, and it ends with one of the more suprising end I have ever seen. When you see the outro of the game a lot of questions appear in your mind and you will start thinking about the whole story and not sleeping during the night :D.The combat system is also quite good and first of all funny, and the game difficulty is also pretty balanced related in what you choose. I started the story in the hard mode, the most difficult I could choose, and I've to admitt that was a bit frustrating in some points like boss fights.I would u really reccomend this game. My final mark is 10/10			"

												Oh man, this game. It warms my heart only writing about it. So good. First, the game looks very good, and the best thing about it is the warm color palette. Plus a very intresting art style. And killer facial animations. And that's about it about the graphics.But u aren't buying Bioshock Infinite for the graphics. You're buying it for an amazing universe, with breathtaking vistas of a floating city. For a great background. For a great story, that will mess with your brain. For real characters. For a lot of action and speed (except when you don't get any of the two).My real problem is that you just don't get enough combat. You enter a large open area, a large plaza with all sorts of ways to move around on floating mono-tracks(or whatever) and floors, and ways to dispose of enemies. And you get a handful of bad guys and that's it.Still, i heartly recomend this game. It's amazing, and even when it slows down, you will be blown away by something after the next corner.Peace.			"

												What a wonderful game! These 11 hours of gameplay are hardly going to get out of my mind!

The characters, the plot, the controls and the graphics are just remarkable!			"

												Apparently... after blowing up a beautiful city flying because of a miracle of physics, kidnapping and seducing a young girl, and killing everyone in the process... I am still the good guy... This game was quite an interesting go on parallel universes. I have to admit I did not fully understand every thing but I think I got the big picture. One of the interesting parts for me was the ego view, in which your character still talks. you don't get much of a say in it.You may do some minor decisions, but still I don't think anything really changes, no matter what you do.After a while the battles got a little boring for me... you either are slaughtering them all in the numbers... or you are a two shot for the bigger ones. But that may be the case, because I played on the highest difficulty. Some enemies, like the ""Handyman"" are quite frustrating in the case, that even their weakspot takes more ammo than you can carry around. And if you die ones they get healed by even more. Yet it stayed challenging and the enemies make the game really atmospheric. I won't compare it to the other parts, because for me the charm of Bioshock 1 & 2 was the dark, theme, everything was in some tight spot and there was no airway to the destination, while in Bioshpock infinite everything was way more open and you felt more free overall.Last to be said I really missed the Big Daddies, but the one thing that tends to satisfy me more on this game is that you finally are meeting people, instead of talking to them over the radio.Took 12 hours for the main campaign, I will play the DLCs next and refer to them in an extra review.

												Bioshock Infinite is an absolute masterpiece. Combining excellent gameplay with an immersive world and accompanied by an enthralling story, Infinite is a game that we are going to remember for a very, very long time. It's about average length (about 12-14 hours), but every frame of the game is thrilling in one way or another, and the subtext found within the game is brilliantly executed and will keep you thinking about your ideals. An absolute must play.			"

												Following on the great success of the 1st two games of this genre (bioshock 1 & 2) comes Infinite! As the core game goes I ventured upon the following differences cautiously!1. The platform or playing area/space is a LESS crowded scenario than before! In Bioshock 1 & 2, I constantly felt subdued by the environment; here there is air-to-breathe!2. I felt like there were more pick-ups in Bioshock 1 & 2. (somewhere the sense that the DLC I bought made the difference in pick-ups was a scary thought...what would I have done without them?).3. Ok, the central game, most is played in the BLUE-SKIES. Compared with the DEEP-BLUE-SEAS like in Bioshock 1 & 2 (no problem with that-the dlc has more DEPTH DIVING so to speak).4.Alright. The mad-magazine humor-me horror does continue but not to the extent it did in Bioshock 1 & 2. Bioshock 1 & 2 MADE FULL USE OF THE SCREAM QUALITY in that way of thinking! Where-in the previous installments this was an unreasonable rambling that could be ignored; with enough attention NOW there is an attempt here to LOGICATE the craziness here (MAKE IT SENSIBLE-more so than before)! The villains intellect here is higher than the ZOMBIE level it was before.5.Then the issue of saving little girls from the error of their ways (NOTE : a very moral issue) IS NOT EVEN HERE! Sure you're WITH Elizabeth and she's your partner, but it's NOT THE MAJOR ISSUE IT WAS TO BE SAVING HER! She is your partner (think co-op)! The mislead little girls aren't sprawling like they were! 6.The idea of tears is an interesting one where I have seen it repeated in the game CONTRAST (CONTRAST feels like a genuine spin-off of THIS GAME, saying that in a good light, reminiscent).The following you may want to note!A)-As a package I am pleased in purchasing Infinite! The DLC offers another 2 full on single player campaigns! Ace!B)-The cassettes with comment are interspersed throughout the game in the tradition of Bioshock.C)-If you're wanting a ""Bioshock"" game then this IS YOUR THING, get it! It does stray a little from the formula of the 1st two games but it's Bioshock all the way!Game on.			"

												Personal Rating: 9.5 of 10Bioshock series is like a perfect piece of dessert/pie/cake, made with the finest ingredients all blend together to create a perfect little masterpiece just right for the taste bud and each series is simply the same good ol' masterpiece offered in different flavour. Alas, each game will leave a strong after taste.For a FPS game, Bioshock Infinite surely doesn't fix what is not broken. Meaning you will easily get used to everything this game has to offer and feel really comfortable to play. The visual style is vibrant yet pleasant and beautiful presented with its alluring composed score makes this game a delight to play.The game is a semi-opened area where you can explore certain locations if not proceed directly to the designated locations but exploring is nonetheless rewarding. Each area will present itself with threats and ridding of those you can freely explore the area. Sounds repetitive? Not when the game offers series of powers and weapons with ever changing scenary with a strong storyline to backed it. You will never really feel bored and thats the best part. Everything the game has to offer are done so moderately even the ""Sky Rail"" which is why I mentioned it is well balanced.The game really captures your gaming experience by putting you in the world with the intense fight and the minor details they did with the environment and dialogues of NPCs.The DLCs are similar to the likes of Dishonored with 2 of them offering chunky story based content and 1 challenge pack. The story DLCs are in my opinion worth every penny as it features new locations, powers and weapons even playstyle. The challenge pack can be rather frustrating if you are trying to collect all the achievements but you get to have a museum. Like the main game, you need to collect money and upgrade your arsenal and powers but these are tracked as you can save your progress in your profile. The latter DLC is simply provides a little edge to the main game such as arsenal upgrades (which you have to pay for) and also some money, addtional gears (clothing that gives you perk) and upgrades which is really nice to have.Needless to say, as a First Person Shooter genre and Bioshock fanatic, this game is a must have.

 Games can also be masterpieces Bioshock Infinite was my first contact with the serie (year 2013), and I loved its story. Good graphics, great sounds, characters keep talking constantly, nice map construction.. everything make you feel inside this wonderful story.I was (I'm still) so impressed that I played the original BioshockAnd I get more amazed by it's story, by its philosophical questions, by this hypothetical utopia/dystopia called Rapture. And then I played Bioshock 2, and then Minerva's Den, and then I got the DLC's of Bioshock Infinite (Burial at Sea), and today (2016) I finished all games and DLC's released in the hardest difficulty. Thanks to everybody who did this games. And the last thing I have to say is the same thing I told you in the beggining: Games can also be masterpieces "

												BioShock Infinite is one of my most appreciated games of 2013. This is a piece of art. What makes it more special than the others is that the emotional impacts are not jump scares. And the idea is much better.I finished the game pretty fast, but I gotta tell ya it worths its money. The graphics were the first thing that I appreciated. After an hour of gameplay I tried to understand the story. If you don't, don't worry. You will do once you get deep in the game.The facial effects are just awesome. I don't think I am the only man who watched Elizabeth passing from a spiritual form to another. Every face in that game shows a highly detailed sensibility and interest for the story and then, the game.If you ask me about buying it, do it! It is the best game from 2013, I believe. This is one of the best games you will ever see in the next 3 years. Trust me!			"

												Bioshock Infinite is an absolute masterpiece. Combining excellent gameplay with an immersive world and accompanied by an enthralling story, Infinite is a game that we are going to remember for a very, very long time. It's about average length (about 12-14 hours), but every frame of the game is thrilling in one way or another, and the subtext found within the game is brilliantly executed and will keep you thinking about your ideals. An absolute must play.			"

												I avoided the two+ years of previews, announcements, E3 demos, trailers, and everything else hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising buys for this game. Had no clue what it was going to be about other than ""the new Bioshock game from the makers of the original one."" That's probably why I'm so impressed by it.Though I usually play games on Normal mode, I played through this one on Hard and feel like that's absolutely the way to do it. (Only 13% of players seem to have followed suit.) This isn't the sort of on-rails ""carnival ride"" that's become synonymous with ""AAA"" gaming.  Most sequences aren't scripted, and fights generally take place in open areas with lots of approaches. You'll be backtracking for health and ammo (which is often scarce), so the fact that there's a significant amount of optional story/upgrade content revealed for exploration makes you look forward to doing so. In fact, a lot of those battleground spots are wide open enough that you don't get to really see it all until after the music calms down to denote ""everyone around is dead.""Unlike Borderlands, if you're playing a recording and someone starts to talk, the recording mutes for the talking. You can't cancel out the ""this will only be said once"" dialogue so easily, and you can replay all the past recordings. Note: the ""Gameplay"" menu it keeps talking about is NOT the ""Gameplay"" menu that appears when you hit Escape. Press ""O."" That was dumb of them, to have two sub-screens with the same name. But that'll let you replay all past recordings, check your objectives, and change your gear (items that confer passive effects, many of which are quite good).Like the first Bioshock, you can only carry two weapons at a time. You can only quick toggle between two powers at once as well, though the game will pause if you want to select a new ability. Between this and the upgrade system, there's little incentive to diversify your loadout. Especially when re-enacting the Hitchcock 3D horror movie is so effective; upgrade that so it creates traps if you kill someone affected by it and you will be a BEAST. On the subject of traps: USE THEM. There are sections of the game that are intentionally quite difficult without them, and in Platinum Games fashion these are meant to be ""gates."" As in, the developers figure ""the player should really use this if they wish to proceed past this point."" Unfortunately, as is also Platinum Games fashion, almost everyone playing did not figure this out because there is no gameplay tip displayed on screen or character verbally telling you ""you probably want to try this now."" Sure, you're informed traps exist each time you get a new ability, but it's up to you to figure out to use them. Global Achievement stats tell the story: 58.1% of Bioshock Infinite owners beat the game (13% on Hard). Only 25% bothered to even USE the traps. This is why you hear people SUPER♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at the ""boss"" encounters, saying ""Irrational, you done effed it up!"" Those people opted to brute force respawn through tough encounters. Don't do this. USE THE TRAPS. If you walk into an area and see enemies unaware? SET TRAPS. You will save many, many bullets. To not do so is to resign yourself to a cyclical fate of respawning with not enough ammo.Bioshock Infinite is a damned good *game*. I'm not slogging through it just for its story and characters (both of which are also quite good). We live in a world where lots of people think ""oh, I'll just watch a Youtube video of someone playing it, because I want to treat games the same way that I treat film and television [also, I don't want to devote the money/time myself]."" The people who do that are doing the medium a disservice and only perpetuating the on-rails uber-linearity of ""AAA"" games. I say nuts to that. I say murder a bunch of dudes, then zoom the camera super close to their awesomely mutilated bodies and take screenshots.  Why, I took several hundred for this game alone!			"

												Great Story, medicore Gameplay. If you play it, start on Hard or better on 1999-Mode (enabled with Cheat) to make it a little bit of a Challenge. But definitly worth it to experience to Story.			"

												TITLE : BIOSHOCK INFINITE + Season PassDATE : 26-Apr-2017 (Completed main + extras)SETUP : Windows 10 64-Bit, MSI GT80 (980M SLI) Laptop, Logitech F710 GamepadRATING (rated as if released in 2017) Optimization : AStorytelling : AGraphics : ASound : AControl : AFun Factor : AValue : AGreat storytelling, memorable characters, good voice acting. The story keeps you guessing until the end although I have to say that the plot twist is rather cliche and I can smell it miles away. And at the end, there still things left unexplained. Visually, the game world look stunning with beautiful designs and great details. Unlike the previous dark and claustrophobic world of BioShock 1 and 2, BioShock Infinite feels more open and sunny and happy, it's like you're playing shooting game in an amusement park built above the clouds. The music is great and really help getting you immersed into this 1912 steampunk fantasy world. Combat system is fun and controlling your character in combat is smooth. I really had fun playing this game. The only thing I dislike is that this game doesn't have ""New Game Plus"". After spending time exploring every corners on every levels to find upgrades and collectibles, I really wish I can start over with all the upgrades and collectibles intact. For me, current normal price is still too high for a game released 4 years ago, so if you can find this game at a discounted price, I definitely recommend it for grab.			"

												В 1900 году Америка, находясь на пике технологического развития, построила огромный высокотехнологичный летающий город Колумбию, который должен был стать гордостью американской нации и невозможным чудом среди творений человека. Однако, через некоторое время, Колумбия вышла из-под контроля и исчезла из поля зрения. Главным героем является бывший сотрудник «Детективного агентства Пинкертона», Букер ДеВитт. В 1912 году к нему обращается некий человек, знающий местоположение Колумбии. Под предлогом списания с него долгов просит освободить оттуда девушку по имени Элизабет. Начинается всё очень безобидно, мило и невинно, однако во что всё это потом выходит? Игра восхитительна, графически красивый шутер с интересным сюжетом, запутанным и сложным (если в целом говорить). Интрига сохраняется до самого конца, если кто-нибудь не ""наспойлерил"". Общая стилистика игры отличная, но главная фишка Bioshock Infinite, Элизабет! Элизабет действительно оказалась очень милой девушкой. Элизабет обращает внимание на любую мелочь! Очень реалистично проработанный напарник, скорее почти настоящий человек. В течении всей игры, её эмоции отображались у неё лице (радость, страх, злость и т.д). P.S: Главная суть игры: существуют тысячи параллельных измерений, где один и тот-же человек, или предмет могут находится в разных ситуациях и состояниях. Оценка: Гениально 10/10. Кооператива нет, что немного огорчает			"

												I found BioShock Infinite to be another good game in the series. After tweaking a few keybindings, the game's controls felt very comfortable and I was able to enjoy the fast paced combat to its fullest. One of the strongest aspects of this game is the storyline. It keeps a decent pace and gets you emotionally connected to your companion, a peculiar girl whose manerisms and bright eyes personality make her difficult not to like. She also adds a handful of interesting mechanics that prevent her from being a random NPC who follows you.			"

												One of the greatest games I have played in a long while. I am not traditionally a FPS gamer but was sucked in by the very excellent storyline. I've played it through too many times now and always find something new. The graphics are stunning and is well thought out in terms of game play. Really, who can pass up the chance to play a game set in a steampunk city in the sky. So much fun. So many hotdogs in drawers. I have recommended this game to all my game loving friends. Even if you don't like shooter games you'll like this as the story and visuals are the most compelling element. Just play this game already.			"
