												Great helicopter sim ever based my opinion. Easy control, so we don't need have a lot time to play well. Just remember some necessary button, so we can fly and launch hellfire to enemy bunker. :),			"

												YES OH GOD YES! One of the classics! Grab your joysticks and unleash the fire! I liked Comanche 3 better, but 4 is good too. Great controls, interesting missions, challenging, fun and in-depth.Warning: it is OLD and it shows. It really does. It's not an easy game either. I recommend it with all my heart anywayedit: 2016 is ending, and this game keeps me in not-suicidal spirits. IT'S SO GOOD			"

												I still remember playing this game in 2005, a truly epic helicopter flying experience. Graphics in this game are just great and enjoyable for its time of release (2001). Gameplay combines simulation with arcade controls, missions participate on many locations were action is both on ground and air and voice acting is realistic as gameplay, which is just incredible and amazing.For me 10/10 for this nice classic sim. This is Griffon 2-6. Review completed. Returning to base "

												This game is THE helicopter game. It is an old game, yes, but personnaly I find it very amusing and nice to play! I used to play it when I was younger and now that I refound it I am so happy. You can play alone or multiplayers. It is better playing with a joystick. You actually can do everything you want with your helicopter : you can follow the mission but you can also .... get crazy! and kill your allies, destroye trucks, trains, gasoline tanks etc... . When you fight the enemy, it can be against another helicopter or against ground units. As well, you have several types of missile, rocket etc.. . Most people will dislike it because it is old and there are nowadays better helicopter games, yes but well you have to try Commanche 4 which is epic! 69 / 100			"

												Comanche 4 is quite OLD and it shows. It really does. But for a 2001 game, it is to be expected! Still, I had fun playing this helicopter simulation. The game is quite challenging as if you get destroyed, you have to restart the whole mission. Thankfully (or not), the missions aren't very long and you can beat the game under 4 hours, sadly. PROS:+Interesting missions.+Tight controls (plays very well with Keyboard and Mouse).+Gameplay is great! +Authentic and very accessible (easy learning curve).+Game works without a hitch on modern systems.CONS:-Graphics are indeed dated for modern gaming but I'd guess it wasn't that great looking back in 2001. Also, knowing Novalogic, that never were their strong suite anyway.-Might not appeal to the hard-core sim fans.-Very short campaign mode (can be beaten under 4 hours).RECOMMENDATION:To any and all fan of military helicopter simulation, I'd say give this game a whirl!RATING:7.5 / 10			"

												Tons of fun, and still runs great on Win 7 x64. Max resolution is kind of low, but overall graphics are still running fine.Comanche 4 is an enjoyable mix of fun and realism - realism to an extent that you can jump in, figure things out quickly, then play a few missions. There is no flight model, so there's really no steep learning curve. The only thing a player needs to practice is detecting anti-air and learning how to use cover to engage. I miss Novalogic, and I wish they would give some of these older games some TL&C. Comanche 4, along with Armored Fist are gem's of the past - unfortunately Armored Fist doesnt run - but bring back some great nostaglia.			"

												Flight controls and movement definitely not realistic but that's what makes it fun and easy to fly. Flight physics is done much better in Helicopter Rescue 2014 but that is a new title so it's kinda an unfair comparison. Why is it not realistic? Well turning the helicopter is like turning in an fps shooter; there's hardly any inertia or sense of weight. Ahh but who cares? it's a game so it's gotta be fun more than it needs to be real right? Yeah it's fun, landing is easy peasy, no wind drift at all, definitely not complaining.I didn't play this back in 2001 'coz i prefer speed of a fixed wing craft. Getting this in a bundle (Machines Of War) is a real steal, oops i mean deal. Game works with Windows 7 64-bit right out of the box, err i mean on the get go. The GPU detection algorithm considered my laptop PC more than enough to handle it so it said that high settings at 1280x1024 were applied which is the max setting but when i went into the game it was set at 640x480 res so that's a bit weird. Anyway, no trouble changing to the max res.Most of the games in this bundle works without any trouble. Tachyon was a bit tricky to get running. F16-Multirole fighter is hmm... was giving me a bit of a trouble, will look into that. Armored Fist 3 haven't been tested yet so i'll update the review in their respective store pages later.Overall this is a good bundle, you get six full games with no DLC shenanigans at basement prices. Definitely a steal i mean deal.

BTW almost forgot to mention. There are invisible walls around closely placed structures. For example, during the training i was tasked to blow-up fuel tanks. The tanks in front were destroyed but when i shot missiles at the one behind, they are indestructible. Had to fly around to get an unobstructed line even though it looks clear from the front. This i think is due to the technique in which 3D objects are made and the approximate way destroyed objects are presented. Not accurate but not a deal breaker for me either. Just need to remember to go around to get a clear shot.			"

												This game sort of reminds me of those apache simulator PC games, and I remember how hard it was playing those, but this game however is much easier to play with either a joystick or keyboard. This game also reminds me of Army Men: Air Attack and Air Combat, because you always blow stuff up while in the air with machine guns and missiles.			"

												I played with the expectation of comanche gold graphics, controls, and quality. I was dissapointed to say the least. However, after putting some time into it and messing around the game, I played through most of the missions succesfully. The missions are a little on the short side and a few times unclear as to what to do next but still fun to play.It is a good (old) game overall, just a bit on the simple side and of course the graphics definetly show their age.

												I really enjoyed this game from my youth, and when i got it i was happy to relive the experience, and it was not very great.There is only one problem i have with the game, and it's a big one. I have a modest computer which should have no trouble running a game this old, and yet every 5-10 seconds there would be a frame rate stutter that would last around a second. Very annoying, and i do not know if it is my computer's problem or wether it is just not optimized... or something like that.Actually there was one thing i didn't like about the gameplay. I get it, Comanche is a fast stealth helicopter with powerful weapons, and the game is not supposed to be very easy, but alot of the enemies (in later missions) all have these super powerful anti air missiles that takes just 3 seconds to lock onto you and not even the Flares will save you. but actually this is probably just my problem for wanting to go in guns blazing vs modern military force because it worked so well against Pirates with terrible weapons.

												I first played a demo of this game which came with a GeForce 4 graphics card. I thought it was fun back then in 2002 and I kept playing it occasionally even in 2008. Now, 13 years later, I remembered this thing existed and found full version of Comanche 4 on Steam.Pros:1. Militaristic feel to the game. Still somewhat immersive.2. Explosions looking good.3. Distant explosion sound travels across levels, that means you don't hear explosions instantly when they happen a mile away.4. Elevation toggle control and stuff, pretty solid controls.5. Diverse missions.Cons:1. Only few 4:3 resolution presets. No custom resolutions support, not even using .ini tweaking. This is fatal. I can stand dated graphics, but playing 4:3 on a relatively small 16:9 screen never feels good. I could use scaling though, but I doubt I can accept stretched visuals nowadays.2. You can't see much beneath you and can't shot what you don't see (unless you've locked on a target, but you need to see it in order to lock on). This is not how helicopter cannons work, m8. They should point atleast 45 down, but in this game it's limited by tilt and vertical FOV. This forces you to fly on low altitudes which is not what I'd expect from a game like this.3. All intense fighting equals ""rapidly clicking right mouse button to lock on targets and shooting down the targets with the corresponding weapon"".Will I recommend this game? If you are OK with playing on 4:3 resolutions and not afraid of♥♥♥♥♥♥ripping hardcore missions, this might be waht you seek. Otherwise, it's a thumb down.			"

												A little note on the controls:If you're expecting this to play out more like a simulator with realistic helicopter handling (e.g. Battlefield or ARMA series) - unfortunately you won't find that here. While the game tries to keep a more serious and realistic tone overall - flight model is one thing that was kept simple and arcadey. It controls more like your standard WASD shooter, with the addition of ascend/descend keys to replace jumping/crouching. This simplified flight model is very easy to get into if you find realistic controls overwhelming, however it also lacks a lot of piloting depth that more demanding players may prefer.			"

												I personally do not like this game as much i love ""Gunship!"" because that game was released in 1999 and was the MOST completed helicopter simulation game ever created and to the date there is no game which can match its level. so i came with high expectations to comanche 4 because it was newer than gunship but it does not mean the game is bad, it actually is good and it is fun to play a casual helicopter flight game. this game is no way close to a ""simulation"" so if you are hoping to face something which is realistic then do not touch it because it is not realistic at all.for its price it is a good game i do recommend it and online works fine too so have fun playing with friends, but if you are expecting a real flight challenge then you will be disappointed. for example all your weapons function like your cannon, you can aim anywhere with rockets just like you do with the cannon without facing the right direction, rocket pods rotate like cannon does in this game so yea :D LOL			"

												Another in the simulator genre, This one has you take on one of the most covert helicopters ever developed, the Comanche; The controls are a little on the confusing side if you don't have a joystick setup, this game seems to have been designed around you pretending to actually be in the cockpit of a helicopter, this isn't necessarily a bad thing but if you are a laptop gamer on the go then you might need to do some key remapping.

												I love Comanche: Gold. It was 3rd in the series plus extra maps. It was more realistic and is a simulator. Comanche 4 is more arcade-ish but that's ok. It has cutscenes and other features. They did bring back the voice actors as they are noticeable but Comanche: Gold seems to offer more variety and better graphics. Or maybe it's just my eyes. This is still a great game. I wish Steam sells the older Comanche! Novalogic is a great game developer! 9/10! Get it, if you like arcade-style flight games!			"

												This game is fantastic once you've settled on a control scheme that works for you. I say that because the menu is very convoluted when you set your controls. And you'll want an older monitor, no widescreen here. But still a fantastic game! I remember it being featured by nVidia to showcase the GeForce 4 back in 2002. Great shiny water and bump mapping. The gameplay of course is excellent with the right controller, or even just the keyboard is fine. Surprisingly satisfying targeteting mechanic and combat, Fairly good variety of missions. Although I do sometimes have this urge (that can't be satisfied) to leave the helicopter to run and gun on the ground... It is truly just a great helicopter-only game. A very great one!			"

												Mediocre game at best, extremely similar to delta force. All you do is spam bullets and missiles at ''terrorists'' and try not to die... that's about it. It's probably good for fathers who had a long day after work and they just want a simple game to pick up and play, not a lot of thought process required but can still be challenging if you are not careful. The enemy dies easily but so can you if you don't keep your distance and keep moving.			"
