												My sister and I used to play this all the time. She isn't here anymore and just having this installed on my Steam library is the most absolute important thing in my mental state.  I'm not giving a sad story however, what I'm telling you is this game will leave you with memories. Out of all the things my sister and I did, this is the strongest memory. This game is legendary and I know not many people play it at all anymore. Though this game is worth every cent put into it ever. to anyone who has played this, I know you have tons of memories too.

												♥♥♥♥ing. Hell. Yes. The Arena is a cruel, cruel Mistress - she will build you up, only to break you, & just when you think you're rid of her, she'll drag you back into her clutches.In short, for those of you who are woefully unaware, Quake 3 is hands down the pinnacle of the ""Old School"" '90s FPSs designed by the original id Software team, using an entirely different Gameplay model than the Modern FPSs of CoD & BF. A more common term for it is ""Twitch Gaming"" due to the extreme level of reaction time required to truly match up against not only other players, but also the Bots. To quote Dark Souls - ""Prepare to Die"", because you will, over, & over, & over.Seriously, buy it. Once you do, get ioQuake 3 (Google it), & the Quake 3 Widescreen Fixer Mod.As far as the Online Multiplayer portion (which is arguably 95% of the Game) fear not, for the MP Community is still extremely active, & if you're of the ultra-competitive nature, the CPMA Mod (Challenge Pro Mode Arena - the Standard in Q3 Competitive Play since nearly the very beginning) ups the ante by making an already difficult Game even harder (works both Online (PvP) & Offline (Bots).See you in the Arena, challenger.... If you dare ;DP.S. You're also going to want to check out ""Defrag"" at some point or another, if for nothing else then to just learn more about THE most insane Mod of all time, hands down.			"

												Great game, You said Battlefield? You said COD? You said CSGO?pfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff...I can prove you then when you say that these games are best. Can you launch your games on a laptop with Intel Atom? Nooo. If you do not have new hardware, these games can fail to start, and even if it does, you may feel discomfort with your FPS.You said 30 FPS is normal? No. To play FPS shooter and not feel discomfort in the game you need AT LEAST 60 FPS.Ok? you can say that I haven't money for a new processor, graphics card. ButYou said about great graphics and physics. If you often play in FPS shooters, you can know how quickly action happening on the screen. You say that you can enjoy the graphics during your play? I am no because it really everymilisecond action.Ok that's not problem. What happens if you want to play a shooter with your friends when you travel or in camp?I don't know how you setting the Peer-to-peer network to play Battlefield :DFor this game it's easy to connect.So are you still doubt that the game is cool? Than buy it and try, also rep my recommendation :DYou can also write me to offer me to buy game which you like and I write a review.			"

												This game will never die.  From 1999 to the present, this game has been at the heart of Esports throughout.  After Challenge Pro Mode Arena (CPMA) was released the competitive community divided.  Since then, the game's popularity has seen a steady decline.  Currently, there is only a small crowd of hardcore fans that still enjoy this game.  Around 2007-2008 a new iteration of this game came along as a free-to-play web version named QuakeLive.  Download QLPrism (standalone browser made specifically to run QuakeLive) to fully enjoy.  As a pro-subscriber in Quakelive you can spawn servers to run all kinds of fun gameplay from simple duels to team based games and now Quakelive even includes Race mode (Quake3 DeFRaG Mod).  Quakelive is constantly updated with new content (gametypes, maps, custom options) making it the most comprehensive Quake ever.  Quake 3 is one of the most enduring games in all of FPS history.  The gameplay is dynamic, engaging and unique.  If you are a fan of fast-paced, deathmatch style gameplay, Quake3/Quakelive is the ONLY game for you.  Takes years to master, takes seconds to become addicted.Currently, there is some debate over whom the G.O.A.T. (Greatest Of All Time) of QuakeLive is.  The greatest contenders for the title include the two finalists of Dreamhack Winter 2013, the Belarussian ""Cypher"" or the American ""Rapha.""  Other names through the years include American ""Zero4"", the Swedish aim master ""Toxjq"", and the notorious Russian ""Cooller"".In the end, I see the competition for this title always coming back to the two:  Cypher or Rapha!  After the latest Quakecon and Dreamhack tournaments in 2013 you can see why!!			"

												Quake 3 Arena isn't really an expected sequel of Quake franchise. It actually throws off single-player portion fully and focuses on mutliplayer part, which was quite wise as of that time. Arena-styled Deathmatch was still hot and at the peak of interest, you see. It came out in 1999. It's notable that in same year Unreal pulled off same trick, coming out with Unreal Tournament.It also had ports to Dreamcast and PS2. Dreamcast is awesome, supporting keyboard+mouse, 4-player split-screen, had online multiplayer and had new awesome music that PC doesn't have. PS2 version didn't had online part, but had improved single-player, with some story, from what I know. Didn't check out that one yet, but it has different final boss.As you expect, it has usual technical problems nowdays.Game doesn't support widescreen by default. But you can look up Community Guide on Steam, one explains how to set it up easily.Steam Overlay is conflicting with this game as well. If you try to immeditly play at default setup, you will be horrified by all the graphical flickers and glitches. You have to go to game's system options and disable ""GL Extension"", after that it should be fine.Though, some computers will still experience crashes here and there. In this case you will have to disable whole Steam Community for this game. Bai bai overlay.I think that auto save from Team Arena expansion may erase Quake 3 Arena save. Goes both ways. So be careful with that one.As for multiplayer community, it's somewhat alive. There are some servers with some players. Most often you will meet servers full of bots. Other times it will be pro players who will rip you apart.So, what can I say. Q3 is a classic arena, where you spawn, you stock up, you encounter, you restock. Or respawn. While strafejumping and bunnyhopping like a chicken. Everybody starts the same, they spawn in random spot with no good weapons. After that you have to grab all the goodies on the map. Weapons, ammo, health, armor and powerups. Stocking and restocking is quite important, having more armor and health than opponent will put you into superior position. If you are good at shooting and maneuvering, that is. Health and armor over 100 slowly drop down, so you want to make use of it. You also want to be the first to grab the respawning powerup, which is announced by subtle sound. Pro players time it in mind. Remaining powerups drop from defeated players. And when it comes to duel, you should make sure that opponent will not get to timed powerups and big bonuses. It's called ""Arena Control"". It'a also wise to sometimes not to encounter the opponent.It also has some physics exploits like bunnyhopping and harder to pull off strafejumping. Thankfully, bots don't use them.Weapons are designed to be balanced with each other and to be useful in each own situation. It's mostly a tried and classic combination weapon set, of rocket launchers, shotgungs, railguns and such, so people who wanted a gun that ricochets around walls and turns enemies into ice cream critized them heavily. They work really nicely though. Railgun requires at least two hits on a row for average opponent, which is always better than usual instakill of sniper rifles in other games. Shotgun is good even for medium distance and just gives off a nice hitscan punch. Rocket Launcher is universal, good for splash damage with huge direct hit damage. Good for rocketjumps too. Really, it's great to see that the game took more balanced weapon approach of Quake 2 and tried to combine it with faster pace of Quake 1.Level design is great too, with nice astethic. It's either sci-fi base or more of gothic-hellish red style. Like Quake 1 style, but more careful and even more evil at times, it's great. Has enough verticality. Just nicely done, with all the curves and corners. It also has some interesting ""platforms in black space"" levels, though those are the worse bunch as far as balance goes. Too much open space, railfun users be happy. Gets even worse on the level which has many lift-platforms, making it all look quite messy. Otherwise, nice layouts with nice looks.Soundtrack is also nice too, being ambient-like at times and more actiony techno at others. Somewhat unique.It has Free-For-All Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Duel and Capture the Flag modes. And bots are pretty bad at Capture the Flag for some reason. Expect to see them running with machine gun, failing to defend and failing to retrive the flag.Now, as far single-player, well, it's pretty much a bunch of bot matches with some progression. The in manual says that mysterious race Vadrigar teleported the greatest warrior of all time into arenas for their own amusement and they can't be fooled by Death, combatants just respawn. in the end you will beat current champion Xaero, who's spirits will leave the body and it will turn into statue. And errrr, I guess you will be still stuck in Arena. Yep, story is quite an excuse. You will not see any kind of story in game itself, just means that it has many different skins with no bio. Like Id All-Stars, including Doom, Grunt and Ranger. But hey, some skins are cool, check out huge eyeball on two hands.You should play on Hardcore if you are a good player. Normal and lower ones handicap bots actually.And yea, it's just a bunch of Deathmatch matches with boss-like duel match for each Tier. In Deathmatch you will be hunting the weakest and spamming, in Duel you better be controlling spawn of bot's favourite weapon if you want to survive. Final boss really requires it, being Railgun auto-bot pro. This ""campaign"" will fly past quickly. Oh well, at least it has some feeling of progression, better than just leaving player with skirmish only.Did I tell you that bots actually have a bit of behavior personality and favourite weapons?And if you want to go online, then as said, it doesn't have as many players. More of bots. And it has really bad server browser that no one ever liked. Can't even categorize by amount of players.To be honest, with Quake Live around, there is almost no reason to get Quake 3 for online, most of players went to Live. Quake 3 does have gibs, blood and it has Campaign of sorts, so maybe it's better for offliners who don't want to be beaten by pros.And yea, this is old game with classic DM rules. Most modern gamers will not dig it for long. No leveling or such, more duel-based than team-based. But at least it was nice at the time, even if didn't try to be as original as UT, instead giving players more of classic set.			"

												You call that AK 47 a gun? PAHSee this? This is a railgun. It fires DEPLETED URANIUM SLUGS at a speed unpresidented and uncalculatable by any means. It is capable of smashing through your bullet and carrying on through you and all of your buddies behind you. It will leave all of you as a useless pile of flesh. This thing has no recoil. no spread, and no limit to its range. It's only downside is the refire rate, but that doesn't matter if the target's dead.Step up to my level.			"

												I fired this up, bringing back a flood of nostalgia from the late 90's early 2000's FPS scene, when it was all about the frags! Fast paced arcade style action, and Quake 3 had some of the most finely tuned of this, with maps that were fast paced, as well as with their own pitfalls, camping spots, and high-risk items. My favorite part about this game was the customization, I have custom skins, models, weapon paks, maps, everything, and something about ""shaders"" makes me thrilled to see!  All and all, a fantastic game if you have a hankering for nostalgia of the time, and even if you dont, fast paced old school arcade action, with none of that regenerating health and realistic physics bogging down the gameplay. I miss these kinds of games!			"

												Oh man. I remember when my uncle and his friend would bring their monster PCs over to the house when I was 10 years old and played the crap out of this game, they had lan parties all the time. When they went to take a break I asked to play.My mind was blown. This game was amazing to play and enjoy.3 frags left.This is one of those games where investing a lot of time into it and mastering it has a lot to show. I remember when playing it I would get totally destroyed, after a while of getting dominated I'd see patterns, hops, and start seeing why I was getting decimated.Once I would adopt new strategies and work around my weaknesses I would go from getting demolished to absolutely destroying other players. You'd have people going from killing you with rail and LG, to them running away when you pick up an 8-ball or Rail.Not a lot of people play this nowadays but It is THE staple arena shooter. This is a game I'll probably play and enjoy until the end of time.			"

												Legitimately one of the greatest games ever made (ignore my playtime, I haven't had it on Steam for very long and usually play it using ioquake3).Lemme explain for a second. The skill ceiling of this game is so god damn high if you were to design a building with a similar ceiling height, that ♥♥♥♥ would get destroyed by the moon. Every single time you play you get your ♥♥♥ kicked, but every single time you play you want to keep playing because it's SO. GOD. DAMN. GOOD. Everything is perfectly balanced (okay, maybe the machine gun is a little weak, but it's the starting weapon). No loadouts, no leveling ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t- just a game of pure skill and nothing else. Quake is basically the chess of the video game world. Almost everyone is better than you (it's what, fifteen years old at this point?), but it instills this everlasting desire to still be the best there is. Very few games can do that, and it's exactly what makes Quake SO ♥♥♥♥ING GOOD HOLY ♥♥♥♥ HAVE I SAID THAT ENOUGH YET.Don't even bother with Quake Live. Recent changes have casualized the hell out of it, and messed with the balance (in a negative way). Paying $15 for this game is totally worth it, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.Very rarely do I say this, but this is, for sure, a 10/10			"

												/!\ Before you start this game ***DISABLE STEAM OVERLAY*** to get it working. /!\This game absolutely rocked the FPS world back in the day. As a young pre-teen, I played my sports outside, did my homework and when I could, I'd jump on the PC to play this. If you have played Unreal tournament, it may ring a few familiar bells while playing this. If you can tolerate old graphics, you'll able to enjoy the gameplay.What is Quake 3 : Arena? It is a first person shooter (FPS) multi-player focused game with fast pace featuring players duking it out for in front of a race called the Vadrigar. All the player movements are normal (four directional + strafing) with the addition of jumping. Mouse button 3 will allow the player to zoom and C will let the player crouch. Throughout the map there are items available for pick-up in which the player can press enter to use them. The basic strategy back in the day was jumping up and down and strafing while shooting. Playing the game today after so many years seems players have really figured out this technique and it's almost near impossible for me to hit them. Most servers are decently friendly (for n00bs as well) but some servers have some very good players. Most FPS's will demand a lot of attention from the player but this FPS will keep you moving due to paranoia. Non-stop movement is recommended.The AI within the game is actually a formidable opponent. Upon first playing the game, I had some serious trouble beating the first level. I got back on the horse eventually and was able to ride to the next tier. One player mode will have you square off against stronger and stronger opponents the more you progress. The weapons in the game are outlandish in design and style while having their strong and weak points. Some weapons will benefit the player from a long range while some will demand a shorter range. The BFG10K is a plasma based weapon that can fire rapidly. The gauntlet is a short ranged melee type weapon in which the announcer will announce ""humiliation"" if an opposing player is killed. The gauntlet does not require ammo. The lightning gun fires a beam of ""lightning"" and is useful for groups of opponents. The railgun fires a hot slug rounds at a high velocity. It would be better to use this gun from a distance. The plasma gun obviously fires burst of plasma but is slow regarding it's firing rate. There is also a rocket launcher (that is pretty self explanatory and is my favorite weapon as it can make players bounce or explode). The last two include a machine gun and a grenade launcher. All the guns are fun to use but players will find their own style which work for them.There are items scattered throughout the level and respawn after a short amount of time. The first item includes a red armor icon which has the most defense out of all armors. The yellow armor is half as good as the red and armor shards (pieces) will increase your armor by increments of +5. Besides armor, there is health around the map available for pickup. The blue health orb will replenish your health to a maximum while an orange health orb will only do half of what the blue can do. The small gold and green health orbs are the smallest units of replenishment. Also included are power ups. Power ups include a blue icon which quadruples the damage you deal, a red regeneration icon in which when you receive damage your heath will regenerate, a yellow icon which doubles your speed you fire your weapons, a purple icon which allows you to jump at unbelievable heights, invisibility (which is self explanatory) and a battle suit that can protect you from literally anything from the environment (lava, water + splash damage from opponents). Additional items include a personal teleporter (which will transport you into a random spot when in trouble), a medkit which can be activated by the user, in-place teleporters which have a pre-determined destination, jump pads which will launch the player and acceleration pads that will launch the player in the direction they are facing. Don't face the wrong side or an edge when approaching such a pad!As I've said, this game is big time multi-player focused even though it has some single player events. There are differing game-modes to keep the player engaged : Free for all (where everyone plays for themselves), team deathmatch where two teams compete for the highest ""frag"" (kill) score, tournament mode which is one versus one ending after a set time and lastly, capture the flag. Capture the flag is played on maps in which both opposing sides have the same map layout (to keep everything fair).This is a good game for hardcore FPS fan's while the casual gamer may find the graphics and gameplay lacking due to the difficulty. I would consider this one of those games where you really have to take the time to perfect your skill to get the most joy out of it. Back in the day, this game would have got a solid (8/10) rating and still can hold it's own with gameplay. Now that's it's aged :RATING : 6.95/10 Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign C+ Visuals / User Interface C+ Sounds / Music C Replay-ability B- Overall  B- "

												Classic multiplayer. Bit pricey on steam but buying the quake collection on sale would be a really good choice. Endless hours of fun with mods like defrag and CPMA. If you just want the vanilla game try Quake Live first, that being a f2p version of q3 without modding but with a better server browser and active servers. (Notice that you cant play all gamemodes or make own servers without monthly subscription). So... 1. get Q3 from steam and download CPMA  or  2. Play Quake Live for free and notice it's weaknesses and go to step 1. (Or 3. Torrent that shiz and play cpma).			"

												If you disliked Quake Live because how limited it was. Then get Quake III Arena!The main competitor to Unreal Tournament '99. This game is moddable, and you could find hundreds of custom models to play as, like Vash the Stampede, Darth Vader, and so many pop culture characters to find, download, and play as in Quake III Arena. Even you can download hundreds and hundreds of custom maps to play with others!Regardless of the complaints being multiplayer-focused, it is still super fun, jump, run n' gun fun! Even id Software was nice enough to give us a single player game to get to the top in the campaign. Also, if you want to hone your multiplayer skills, bot match that is easy to find unlike Quake Live. Also, the Multiplayer is still alive to this day, knowing that people prefer this game over Quake Live.If you were disappointed with Quake live, then get this!P.S. You can actually see people's models unlike Quake Live! And it's also completely Buy-2-Play without having to pay for some silly premium content. Just buy and have fun.			"

												I have been playing this game since it first came out when I was just a young lad. I probably have thousands of hours in it and I also used to mod the hell out of it, creating custom player models, skins, weapons, levels, textures, shaders, etc... You won't find a more fast-paced and visceral arena shooter anywhere. The gameplay still stands up to other titles today, in my opinion. The graphics are pretty dated, but if you can get past that just enjoy the haunting atmoshpere of the levels and the relentless, gory action - you are in for one hell of a ride. This is still a go-to for my friends and I when we get together for a LAN. Running through the blood-mist of your friend after you obliterate them with a well-placed rocket never gets old :P I have put countless hours into this title and regret none of them lol. Solid game. Would definitely recommend. I cannot wait for the reimagining of this game in the upcoming Quake Champions :)10/10.			"

(Or obviously the single player, which is, well, what it is.) If you wan't to play the game online i would recommend you to move over to Quake Live which has been stripped of it's F2P status and is now a purchasable game for 10 bucks and a ton of content and updates that have been made to the game over the years.

												This was a game I found lying around my computer desk as a kid. After my first experience playing Quake II, which you can check that review for the experience, I had no idea what to expect from Quake III except greatness. It could have been a new single player, an enhanced multiplayer, really anything. But the word Arena was the next word I saw on the disk. I was a pretty smart kid, so I knew it was going to have a badass multiplayer. Little did I know that it was going to be ALL multiplayer.So I booted up the game after installing it and started watching the intro. It showed some guy shooting down things and running out of ammo. The guy runs away and then decides to rush in. Immediately, I was a little unimpressed. After the Quake II intro, I was expecting awesomeness! Now it was just showing a cliche FPS sequence. Then, after diving towards the enemies, something unexpected happens. Time freezes as the guy is being teleported to some unknown place. This is where id Software did NOT disappoint! After being teleported, it then shows some gameplay of what I was going to be playing with random letters zooming out. I watched the gameplay and knew it had to be awesome. Then, the legendary words filled the CRT monitor.QUAKE III ARENAI was hyped. I could not wait. So I went to the options to peek around and noticed there was a better Player Setup screen than Quake II. You could actually see who you were choosing before you picked them. MUCH better than having to scroll through the different models in Quake II to pick your character. And yes. Before you ask, the same customization of Quake II with being able to play as many different characters is avaliable here too. After picking this weird alien thing named Flisk, I immediately went into the game.The graphics looked really nice. I was gazing upon the room I was in and noticed all the little details in the room. My eyes were like a kid in a candy store. The textures popped out like flowers in a field. The graphical detail was legend, and everything just seemed amazing. Then I noticed the mirror in the room. I gazed at my reflection and loved the little details on my character.Another thing I noticed was the sudden announcer coming through my speakers. ""WELCOME TO QUAKE III ARENA!!"" I had never heard such a thing in a video game before. It was really mindblowing at the time. I then decided to test fire the guns I had collected. The machinegun sounded like a more powerful version of the one from Quake II, and the Shotgun sounded like it was the most devastating thing in the game. I decided to go outside the room and see what was going on around the map.I immediately ran into Crash, the first enemy opponent in the game. She's like Doomguy except she's a girl. I shot her down with my shotgun and noticed that she talked to me in text like she was a friend in real life. Wow! Talk about advanced! I never had a character talk to me in text like that. It was something really special at the time and it's something games just don't do anymore. It's kinda sad, but I can see why.Alright so the gameplay. Well, it's a shooter that is a heavily polished version of Quake II's multiplayer. Even the single player is just a bunch of fights with bots. Nothing really special, but it's good practice. The weapon balancing is something id wanted to do in this game and it really works well. Each weapon has its own use, just like the single player in Quake and Quake II. The Rocket Launcher is good for if your enemy is mid range, while guns like the Lightning Gun and Machinegun are great for long range attacks. The Shotgun is definitely used best at shorter ranges because of the more realistic spread this time around.The gunplay isn't the only thing you'll want to learn in Quake III. Movement is definitely a really important skill to learn, especially if you plan on playing online. Since the original Quake engine had some bugs that made advanced moving techniques that are real useful in multiplayer possible, they decided to embrace those bugs and make them part of the physics of the game. Things like Bunnyhopping, circle jumping, and the infamous Rocket Jump are just a few examples of techniques that made Quake III very famous.Overall, I gotta say that Quake III Arena is to FPS games as Super Smash Bros. Melee is to fighting games. The really complex formulas and techniques that were present in the original Quake are improved and embraced in every way imaginable and the multiplayer community is still really strong. There was even a Dreamcast port of Quake III designed with Keyboard & Mouse controls in mind due to these special techniques that also has cross-platform capabilities with the PC version! Definitely get this game and enter the Arena!			"

												If you weren't around for the release of Quake III, you might be shocked at the furor its announcement kicked up. In the wake of heavily story-driven FPSes like Half-life, Unreal, and even Quake II, the successor of one of the biggest franchises moving to multiplayer-only was seismic. Despite the doom-saying and gnashing of teeth among series fans, Quake III proved to be an instant classic for online FPSes and helped establish the multiplayer-only genre as legitimate. But how does an online-focused classic fare nearly 20 years after the fact?I want to make fun of Quake III's story, but it's honestly about as much of one as Quake I has. Some bunch of space ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s called the Vadrigar have been grabbing badasses from across the universe to mash together in their own little lethal playhouse. This means you can play as the venerable Doom Guy, grunting wonder Ranger from Quake I, luckiest space marine ever Bitterman from Quake II, and a bunch of cooler dudes like a neon skeleton and an eyeball on legs. There's upwards of 30 characters to choose from, but honestly after Party Skeleton they seem kinda superfluous.They're put to good use though in the game's campaign mode. See, there actually IS a single-player mode in Quake III, but it pits you against bots across seven tiers of simulated deathmatches. Starting you out one-on-one against slow-moving opponents in small arenas, the game soon expands to fragfests with half a dozen foes across industrial complexes and eldritch hallways floating in the void. As predictable as they can become, the bots provide a solid challenge at each of their five difficulties so it's actually not a bad place for newcomers to learn the art or veterans to practice their technique.The weapons are simple enough to come to grips with as well. I don't know why the Quake series is so content to have incredibly generic arsenals, but it makes it easy to keep track of here. You start with a standard low-damage machine gun and can locate shotguns, rocket launchers, railguns, and plasma guns around the map, each with its own color-coded ammunition. There are health and armor pickups as well, along with a few stand-by powerups like quad damage. This pickup system, common in the Quake era, makes matches more about map control than anything else and can be a welcome change from modern loadouts and class systems.This isn't going to matter a whole lot if you can't find actual humans to play with, of course. All the games of the Quake series still have fanatics playing them but they are just that, fanatics, which means they are limited in number and absurd in skill. It's not reasonable to expect newbie-friendly servers or anything other than pros to spar with so be prepared for that if you are diving into the scene solo. On the other hand, there are few things more sublime than some classic deathmatch with your closest buddies so if you have others you can take the plunge with this is an easy sell.Barring any graphical weirdness (which for me was remedied with disabling the Steam overlay) Quake III remains a very clean and polished experience, from the sharp if simple graphics to the tinny, growling announcer. Your weapons feel thick and threatening, the gibs gush freely, and the low electric growl of quad damage taking hold never gets old. Without a story-based singleplayer to work through this one does threaten to wear out its welcome. However, a little courage and effort diving into the online community that persists will reveal a world of wonders you might have thought died long ago.			"

An Awesome and Highly Addictive Arena FPS That will Test & Develop Your FPS Skills!Quake III Arena is an awesome fast-paced arena-styled multiplayer FPS game. A pure deathmatch game at it's best. The controls are perfect, the vanilla graphics are still good today, and the gameplay... ♥♥♥♥ing awesome! One of my favorite features is the ability to play against bots with friends. Very fun if you just want to co-op in the game.I will say one thing. This game will test your skills and even help you improve your aim and reaction time as the combat is fast and fierce. After playing this game, I can say I am better at FPS games, especially ones with rocket launchers ;). This is one thing I cannot say you will get from most FPS games. This gives it another reason why this game kicks so much a$$! Not only are you having fun, but you are excersising your hand-to-eye coordination.Easy To ModThis game is also very easy to mod. All you need to do is open the .pk3 files in a program like WinZip or WinRar and you can replace the game's sound effects, graphics, and models with custom ones you either downloaded or made yourself.Talking about mods, I highly recommend downloading ioQuake3 ( http://ioquake3.org ). It replaces Quake 3's rendering engine to suit modern machines giving you better net code and the ability to match your computer's native resolution. You can also download other mods for ioQuake3 to improve the game. Some other mods I recommend is the high res texture pack ( http://ioquake3.org/extras/replacement_content ) and the Metal-Tech v2.0 mod that replaces the textures for the weapons with higher res ones ( http://www.moddb.com/mods/metal-tech-v20-revolutions ).ConclusionOn final note, this game is pure awesomeness and has a high replay value. If you are interested in playing a fast-paced FPS game to test out or improve upon your twitch skills, this is the game for you!			"

QIII is justly considered a classic, and is *still*, 15 years later, the best shooter ever made. Its rules, its physics, its weapons are as simple as they are unrealistic. Yet, it is a perfectly oiled mechanism that you will go back to because it works just right.Because its simple mechanics give you that sense of satisfaction to have played well (or at least, given your best) against worthy oponents, in a set of rules where only your own skill, not your hardware, achievements, level, buddies, equipment... made the difference.Because it is very immersive, despite the unrealism of its setting and dated graphics: its physics, its actions, its pace are just defined by running, jumping and shooting, not encumbered with clunky, over-designed interactions in the name of ""realism"".Because it just works: no bugs, imbalances, lag, slowness, flakiness, choppiness, unresponsiveness, bloated interface, unintuitive design, complexity get in the way of playing.You will simply come back to it because it is The Game, stripped of all the un-essential.

												Install OSP. The instructions suck, but all you need to do is take 4 of the files that start with ""zz"" and put them in q3base. Not the one with ""server"" in the name, that one will make it so single player games don't work. Now if you open console with ~ you can type ""/ch_crosshaircolor 1"" for example. I think names work too, like Red or Blue. Some servers don't like OSP. If you want to play on one that kicks you, take those files out. Keep the entire OSP folder in your main Q3 folder.Other important settings:     \rate 25000    \snaps 40    \cl_maxpackets 125    \com_maxfps 125    \com_hunkMegs 128    \cg_drawTeamOverlay 1    \cg_noProjectileTrail 1    \cg_enemyModel ""keel/pm""    \cg_enemyColors ""iiii""    \cg_trueLightning 1Make sure your mouses polling rate is 500 or less or your gun will get stuck firing sometimes, or not fire at all occasionally.If it keeps forcing your Game Key to Upper Case go into the games directory in Q3base and edit the key file with a text editor. Make it lowercase - save it - then right click the file and go to properties - make it read only. It may still ask for your key after a match but it's just a glitch, ignore it. As long as it doesn't do it BEFORE a match it makes no difference.			"

CONS:-""Old"" graphics, given you're a graphics snob.-ATI GPUs have issues with GL drivers, but can be fixed via ""testapp"" and turning off the GL Extension.			"

												Fantastic, brilliant multiplayer, and the Railgun. This is the only thing you need to know about this game. But regardless, here's some more info.This game naturally inherited the smooth and fast-paced gameplay of its predecessor Quake (1996). As the original Quake was THE deathmatch classic in its time, Quake III Arena successfully rose to the throne and became the new king of its own time. Music is simple, yet it does the job very well. All the characters are very nicely voiced and the maps are, as expected from an id Software game, very very good. Oh and let's not forget the Railgun.This game might be aging just like the original, but it is also timeless like the original. And just like the original, this is an important milestone in FPS genre, even if only for the multiplayer (that's what the game is about anyway!). By the way, did I mention the Railgun?			"

												Quake III was released in the year of 1999, over ten years ago. So you might be wondering why  pay $20 for a game that is the pre-2000 era? Why pay $20 for a game released in the stone ages of gaming? Well, because you can have a BFG or a mega op rocket launcher! What's more fun than hopping around like a mad man spamming a rocket launcher and blowing people apart and seeing their spine fall on the ground? Nothing! So grab yourself a copy of Quake III and end up in a mental asylum just like I did! 20/10			"

												This game is one of the best online games. It still has a very active community online and its very competative. Ive been playing this game since 99 and it is still thriving with the same players.This game never gets old. I love launching someone into the air with a rocket and then shooting them down with a rail. There are all types of game modes to all weapons, only rail and other mods that people come up. This is a very intense game, it might take some time to get used to the gameplay. The graphics to the game are great! You can customize things in the game to suit your style, for example you can choose a custom character or choose a default in game character, you can choose what your weapons look like and sound when you shoot them, there is just a bunch of things to change with the game. The single player part of the game just helps you practice and get ready when you actually face real people.This is a must have for any First Person Shooter lover. If you get it you wont regret it!

												If you've never played this game (or quake 1/2), you cant really call yourself an FPS gamer. The epitome of twitch skills in a game. The raw skill level of players who still play this game is amazing, and probably the highest average skill level of any FPS community that currently exists. Not only is reaction speed and aim awarded, but equally important is fast and accurate movement (which is a skill in itself, and amazing to watch when you see some of the top level players).Very high skill ceiling. Brutal for newbies. Rewarding to master. Makes you better at every other FPS.

												One of the best Quake games from the series, which is also a very great childhood memory for me. Quake is what started the first-person shooter adventure for me, not long before QuakeTF, and it's serious must buy if you like old, fast paced games. Or you can get a free version of Quake III, legally, from www.quakelive.com "

												After completing the campaign twice, and a few matches (I have a physical copy so those hours wont show) I can say that this is one of the best multiplayer based games I have ever played. Tight controls one expects from a PC fps are definetly put to use here, and if you wanted an example of PC over console, this is it. Story wise, this game is weeeaaak. It isnt told at all, and has unexplained cutscenes. You have to read the manual or look it up online to get what's going on, and I'm not going to tell you, as I feel it isnt to prominent in the game or this review. So that leaves the gameplay to decide how good of a game this is. the gameplay, is, amazing. As I said the controls are wonderful, and everything just works. Jumping to frag a guy and doing a 180 to frag another WHILE going dowhill onto another platform only to be propelled to a weapon of mass destruction is a great example of great gameplay, and fantastic level design. I would like to see how this game fairs on a console (Dreamcast version is all I know about unfortunately) but I cant imagine it being as good as the PC version. The soundtrack is a great metal and rock mix, full of the ambient sounds of screaming in some arenas gives off a darker mood, while the use of the metal can pump you up and ready you to blow up everyone in others. As far as characters go like I said the story is basically nill, but each has its own personality and little sayings in combat. Weapons in the game are designed well and all of them are fun to use, though it does seem a bit tedious stalking enemies with the machine gun you get right off the bat. Also, it is nice to see the BFG make an appearance.My score: 8/10Though the story is weak, I rated Half-Life a 8 or 9 and that had mediocre gameplay, so its alright. Also the game is just down right fun to play, and I will come back to it time and time again.			"

												Quake III Arena was the first FPS game that I ever played in my childhood. From there, I had gradually familiarised myself with the controls and the weapons in The Longest Yard , or Q3DM17 for some people (I wasn't adapted to the WASD movement standard yet back then). The greatest memories of that memory from that many years ago was reducing my adversaries into offal paste with the Railgun from a distance. Because of the game's intense gameplay being bolstered by its fast pace and enorphin-filling combat, I had a great time playing Quake III Arena with my fellow players; some of them being a few of my friends. If you want some something that would make you a badass lead farmer, get Quake III Arena, because this is THE god of fast-paced FPS titles before Call of Duty was cool. You know what they say: respect your freaking elders.			"

												QUAKE III has fantastic multiplayer! If you want some good competitive arena style multiplayer that takes skill to be good then you should check this game out! But if you are looking for a campaign then you might want to pass because the campaign is just multiplayer with bots, and has little to no story. Plus it is really short, it took me 2 hours to complete the campaign. Multiplayer is definitely where this game shines. I would recommend QUAKE III Arena to anyone wanting fantastic multiplayer!8/10My 1999 Game of the Year!			"

												There's absolutely no way to go wrong with this title. At a normal 20 dollars, you're probably not thinking too much of it, but, if you're reaing this the same day I put this up, it's THE best time to pick it up, as well as the Team Areana, which is pretty much team-based gameplay; mostly the same as regular Quake 3 Arena.It's the classic tournament-style shooter, consisting of free-for-all matches to conquer and rise up the tiers, only to face one badass dude at the top tier and defeat him. That's not very descriptive, and I've only played two matches with bots after finally getting this myself, but I DO intend on playing the hell out of this. This was my game back when I was like, 10 or so. I think my dad liked these kinds of games the most. He would play this for so many hours in a week, and he'd let me play, too. I was a total boss somehow. I forget what difficulty I played on, but probably just medium.Anyway, the goals are simple and you can't really get tired of this Quake game in particular. I really do recommend this ^-^			"

												Up until a few days ago I had never actually played this game. I just finished single player on skill 3, so might as well do a writeup.It can be a bit jarring getting a hang of the rocket launcher at first, so you might want to try on skill 2 or even 1 to start with. But once you've picked up a rhythm you can turn up the skill level a bit and just enjoy yourself.The soundtrack is one of the best I've encountered in a game.Remember that I've really only done *single player*. For a game that was designed mostly for *multiplayer*. And it was still hella fun.(Ignore the length of time I've spent playing this, I've mostly been playing it in ioquake3. It has red/cyan stereo support. Oh yes.)			"

												For me this was, and still is, the best multiplayer FPS game ever made. What set this game apart from titles like CounterStrike and Unreal Tournament was the depth that the game offered. Weapons are all fairly well balanced yet allowed for you to develop favorites and if you spent the time and effort to master trick jumping it allowed for real dominance over lesser opponents. Unfortunately this great game has had it's day so there are no servers active but the successor - quake live - which is basically a browser version of Q3A, is stil very much alive and free to play.

												I bought this game for at least three times: one was a copy in cracked version of CD ROM format back in nearly more than 15 years ago.2nd time: bought from a store in New Zealand with valid verification code.3rd time: bought on STEAM, ironically the verification code is invalid.game experience: this game recalls my time and sweat in childhood when my mates and me spent countless hours practicing on T2 and at that time, CPL league re-defined the gaming industry in early shape of so called' cyber-athelete'. Makavelli, Fatal1ty, Blue, the names were heroes and iconic which starts the frenzy trend of cyber gaming circel.Q3A was the only game that re-shaped the FPS world, entered new era of mass media and audience even watching on satelite TV for example: NOW. That was the earliest version of live streaming, however the nowadays live streaming only begins its birth 3 years go by Twitch.Q3A also was hardware killer with the awareness aroused by gamers for OpenGL powered 3DFX, and no ticket was given for Nvidia.More rams , more powerful display card drives the hardware industry. Interesting scene.Back to the game, it still has its unique gameplay experience with ruthless NPCs in Nightmore mode and the duels, FFA, deathmatches still co-composed the epic world of best FPS game ever.

												The Quake Series -  These games focus on Gameplay and they do it well.  Fun weapons, fast gameplay, rocket jumping, and mosters from knights to demons.  Always focused on speed and Mutiplayer Gaming.Quake III - in my opinion shares the same space as Counter Strike, Golden Eye, and Unreal Tournament.  This was hands down one of these best mutiplayer combat games ever made.  Tight controls, fun weapons, fun maps, good graphics.  I was so amazed by this game and playing it at a Lan Party one weekend... I dreamed about it in my sleep.  I sometimes wish I could fall in love with another game like this.  If you have freinds and you guys want to try some old school mutiplayer games together... buy copies of this and play against each other... youll love it!!That being said:  This game and some of the other Quake games really pushed the FPS genre into mainstreme and as a competetive sport.

												*Gnome Seal of Approval*id Software perfected the classic deathmatch multiplayer in Quake. Here they evolves it further and adds some other less successful modes. This is a pure multiplayer game with no story. The single player mode consists of deathmatch games against bots which can be set to a difficulty where they are deadly accurate.I've spent hours on end in this game in the past.			"

												The game that defines the genre. Q3 is one of my favorite games and arena fps is one of my favorite genres.If you dont already know about the game ill give you brief overview. Around the maps youll find pick-ups from weapons to ammo to health and armor, Game modes like CTF,TDM,FFA,etc... the most competitive being a 1v1 duel mode.The movment is broken you can gain speed by strafe jumping but its become a core part of the game. I recommend this game to competitive players for being a brutal and hard to master game and i also recommend this to casual players who might want to have some fun with friends.There is Quake Live which is free to play but there are pros to Q3 over QL and the other way around.

												This is one of the greatest first person shooter games out there; fast, frantic action, varying levels, and challenges. This is your classic arcade shooter action, with the simplest of instructions; kill anything that isn't you.It doesn't look as good as your current games, but don't let that deter you, a lot of work went into making this game shine. The weapons and items are balanced, the maps are creative and fun, and it controls well.Even better, is that if you get bored of the stock content, there is a wealth of content created by the community. New maps, character models/skins, weapons, even total conversion mods that turn this into a completely new game.What really dissapoints me about the Steam release is that there is no Linux support, even though id Software provided that support years ago, when the game was released. If you run Linux, like myself, go to:http://zerowing.idsoftware.com/linux/q3a/In short, great game; you are missing out if you never played this.			"

												Quake 3 comes in many different forms and comes highly recommended by me For one looking for a more up to date version may want to check out Quake LiveIt's free and I have no idea why its not on SteamThe original maps, bot campaign, and mods are a good thing to be able to play though. I mainly recommend this if you get the series bundle as the $20 price tag is absurd.My Favorite Mods/addons:ExcessivePlus for 16:9 HUDIoQuake3 High Res Texture packDreamcast Map Pack			"

												Contrary to popular belief, this is a more complete game than quake live, as it has gore, music and no frigging ads, as well as full weapon animations and other cosmetic and stylish stuff that was taken out of the game to make quake live. The question is, will you pay the money for all these, or just play quake live, which is free? I paid, and this game's worth every penny, trust me. Quake live may be free, but it's cut down to core gameplay, and that's not the only thing you come to The Arena for.			"

												Heyyo,It's Quake III Arena... need I say more? ;)I will anyways lol... graphics that still look nice to this date, very solid netcode and a decent soundtrack. Unreal Tournament (1999) is a better game than this one (in my opinion anyways) but this is still a badass game. I did enjoy the AI in Q3A more than UT99 though since they're much more intelligent which is good since back when I used to play UT99 and Q3A a lot? I was on 56k dialup so I couldn't play MP with more than 4-6 guys or I'd lag out haha.Quake Live is a better choice these days than Quake III Arena... because it's free, has better support for modern hardware and has a more active community, but this is still a very good nostalgic twitch-fps game.

I have nothing against CoD or the FPS genre. I think that CoD 4: Modern Warfare is the best in the series, same could be said for Black Ops II. Anyway, Quake III Arena is a hardcore arena-based first-person shooter, similar in vein to Unreal Tournament and Overwatch! Check this game out!			"

												Single-player is just bot-match, but at least i tried out some of the worst maps, no wonder they are not very liked in the MP. This experience made me feel some special kind of special.Gladly i played a lot of MP in my time and it is great, they removed all the dumb guns and returned great ones, though BFG10k in q3 is boring. And the levels are bright and colourful with a lot of jump-pads.It was great playing DM in 2000, but when i returned to it in 2007 i discovered the joy of TDM and CTF. Then i stumbled upon ""excessive"" mods and they are just great, they amped all weapons and gave them infinite ammo while giving players armour and health with quick regeneration. It removed the camping from the game and increased skill dependence in every fight. Besides, it's just awesome to play. Like in some versions shotgun shoots railgun slugs in spread or each BFG shot is surrounded by a lot of grenades etc.			"

												Great engine that is smooth (unlike those disgusting CoD engines). The gameplay is also fantastic and smooth and feels super tight. There is also bot support for you lonely people. The bots are also very tough for noobs like myself if you set them to be hard. They also have great AI in this respect.The level design is of course superb as well as the world design.Sound and graphic design is dated but really isn't that bad considering just how old it is, not that the graphics are what you would be playing for.Not a fan of it retrospectively though.The thing with Quake III for me is the lack of single player, making it not worth it in my eyes and making it my least favourite Quake as someone who never enjoyed playing Quake multiplayer (wrong generation etc.)If I was knockin' around when it came out, I'd like it I'm sure.Truth is with a game like this, everyone who will want a game like this most likely already has it or won’t be reading this review...So don't buy it?8/15 - ""If you are the kind of person who will buy this game, chance is, you aren't reading this review""			"

												Probably the most overrated FPS in history. Nerds think this is still cool because it is faster and more responsive than modern FPS games, which are all COD/Counterstrike clones made for Murrica fanboys. They're partly correct but there is a huge catch.The problem is that the one thing that made Quake faster, strafejumping, is a derp mechanic that just makes this game style look ♥♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous. Everyone is constantly jumping like a complete idiot. It was originally a bug, but because it made the game faster everybody just accepted it, which is fine unless you never come up with something better. A better movement system has existed for over a decade and it's called TRIBES. Not only is Tribes faster than Quake, but because it was designed to be used as such it doesn't look so damn stupid. Besides this the shooting mechanics in Tribes are also more complex than in Quake because there is velocity inheritance on the projectiles. The game is so fast that even at regular speeds this is a necessity because otherwise your bullets/discs would never catch up to the one you're chasing. This happens in Quake where it's been turned into a defrag trick, which adds some layer of complexity but again it just ends up looking like derp.In the last decade there was Warsow, an open source Quake clone which had terrible graphics but more sophisticated movement (in their own words), yet still based on strafejumping. Then there was Reflex, which is a Warsow clone with less sophisticated movement as well as terrible graphics.It's 2017 and this is what's coming: Quake Champions, which is Quake 3 with abilities and better graphics (finally). According to id Software the abilities are there to diversify combat and play into players' strengths, but we all know it's really only there because they want to catch the Overwatch crowd. Because Quake is Quake and Quake designers worked closely with Quake professionals, who are autistic, Quake Champions is going to be Quake, so it's going to be...STRAFEJUMPING.Then there is Reborn, or Balls of Fail, a game made by former Quake players, and surprise surprise, it's Quake. Unfortunately for these nerds, despite having the best intentions of making Quake great again, there's also going to be Quake, which is going to make Quake Quake again. The best thing they could come up with was to make yet another Quake, except you play as balls instead of Sarge, Anarki etc (which were irrelevant because evryone forced models to make it easier or more fair anyway), but instead of using the principle movement characteristic of balls as the basis for their game (BALLS ♥♥♥♥♥ING ROLL, YOU IDIOT), they turned it into...STRAFEJUMPING, which means everyone is going to be jumping around again like a South-Sudanese warlord with the ashes of fallen enemies rubbed on their faces. I'm not saying these games are going to be bad, I'm saying that if you think there were already enough Quakes and wanted something different than Quake, they're not going to be the Jesus of games. Neither will Lawbreakers, sorry. Lawbreakers is going to be Tribes Vengeance with facial herpes. Fun for a couple of weeks, then everyone will go back to...whatever the hell they were doing before that, probably Overwatch because they suck, or Quake because it's Quake, and then everything will be back to the way it always was, because Quake will be Quake and people play it because despite being Quake, it's still better than CSGO or xXx420xC@LLx0Fx187xDUTYx666xXx.Good luck with autism, I heard there's a final cure in the making.P.S. Midair is an upcoming Tribes clone, but it's a Kickstarter scam that will never amount to anything. Too bad, rest in peace Tribes.			"

												This game is by fare better than Quake Live. Quake Live is a clone and with all those add-ons they could have added them to this game. Then again, again who would like a dimmed down gore just so little children can play so they can make more money. I think Paying to play for a game that I already own is bs.Quake 3 is where gaming is at also IOEngine was made because of Quake 3 not Quake Live.I feel Quake Live has killed the Quake 3 gaming scene and Community if you're out there I urge you to support Quake 3 and buy this over paying subscription you will get a lot more out of this than Quake Live.

												I've been playing this game since 2001, this work of art is a fast-paced oldschool shooter gem and should be played. However the latest 1.32 build isn't my favorite, I prefer 1.16/1.11 as it's full with freeze tag servers (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90xMs158L28) *Watch the video*This game definately has its benifits, and disaventages.cons:- Outdated game engine- Incompatible with some video cards (Try using win7's compability mode)- Terrible single-player, as it's just matches against bots.pros:- Fast-paced oldschool shooter- Vast variety of maps, weapon models, player models/skins, server mods etc- Very easy to create amazing custom maps using GTKRadiant (compared to Vavle's Hammer editor)Example of a Q3A Custom map *Watch the video* :

												This is one of the franchises that I hold closest to my heart.Although it is my considered opinion that Quake 3 played second fiddle to the first Unreal Tournament, I can't deny this game. Why? Because you will not find a second fiddle anywhere near this damn good game. Hell, you won't find many first fiddles either. Honest to God: I love this game.I honestly think the era of arena shooters was too short for its own good. Although I have high hopes for the new Unreal Tournament, it might not bring the arena shooter back to the mainstream stage as many have hoped. I hope it does, but I understand it has a lot to live up to.This game has spectactular gunplay that is expected of the Quake series, that fast paced, adrenaline rushing gameplay that made arena shooters fun.The map DM17, otherwise known as The Longest Yard has become one of the most iconic FPS maps, ranking alongside Unreal Tournament's Facing Worlds. There's just no words to describe that feeling of launching off of a boost pad and sniping your enemy in midair with the Railgun. The music fits the game extremely nicely, as do the environments. The computer opponents give you some pretty amusing dialouge during the single player campaign. So what are you waiting for?Get out there and make your enemies Quake in fear!Doom got a remake, Unreal Tournament is in the works, so all we need are Half Life 3 and Quake 5 and the 90's can be here once again!A good old dose of pure 90's fun.

												When I played Quake for the first time I can't really say that I fell in love with it at first sight. I guess it's because I was expecting something more ""realistic"" like Wolfenstein (yeah, I know, at least for the most part of it). Either way, that was because so far I never had the experience of playing anything online. Back in the day I had this friend who eventually convinced me to give it a try. After I started, it didn't take long for me to get hooked on it. Time passed by and someday Quake II was released. Then again, when I tried for the first time I felt kinda disappointed with the game and can't deny that I still feel somehow like that after all those years (I guess it's because I missed that ""medieval environment"" touch from the first one). Anyway, when I first heard of Quake III, I didn't quite know what I should expect. I just read about the premise that the game was developed to be focused on the multiplayer experience. The irony was that although this title had exactly that concept in mind, that was the only one that I never had the chance to play with other people. Hmm what is there to say? For me it felt like a polished version of Quake II's multiplayer and later it wasn't hard to compare it with Unreal Tournament (which I won't deny that I liked better). Besides that, back then there were some really interesting mods involving the game's engine, like for example ""Bid for Power"", which had some DBZ characters and levels to play on. Overall, it's not a bad game, you can even play it casually if you're not in the mood to go through a whole set of matches.			"

												Interesting good game, for which you can kill a lot of hours. You can compete with bots, but you can get online, which is much harder and has already developed strong community of gamers. It is often compared to Unreal Tournament, but I believe that each of these games has its advantages. Nice graphics, beautiful arena, and quite passable scene mode, you can choose any difficulty for passing.			"

												Ok. Where do i start on this game? Although it appears that I have low play time on this game I actually played a hell of a lot of this game before I was on steam. This game is nuts, but you know..... fun nuts. The maps in this game are fun with not too many camping spots (as if you would feel the need to anyway) and are mostly quite large. Now....... The guns. Ok, so first up is the Machine Gun which is only good if you are accurate and your enemy is very inaccurate so lets skip this one. Then there is the Shotgun. One hit kill at short range of course and good damage at medium range. The Rocket Launcher is deadly to both your enemy and yourself but can also tend to take a few hits to kills if not hit directly. The Plasma Gun is basically a super Machine Gun. It has a lot more damage and similar fire rate. the Grenade Launcher in my opinion is the hardest gun to use because you have to time as well as place the grenade well. the Railgun, my favourite weapon, is basically a sniper that you have to no scope with (except unlike no scoper's in COD it actually takes skill) and is either a one or two hit kill. The Lightning Gun shoots out a stream of lightning towards your enemy and does decent damage. It's kind of like a Super Soaker except instead of water coming out there's lightning. And finally there is the BFG10K. now this gun is a one hit kill and has a fast automatic fire rate so it kicks ♥♥♥♥. Now in addition to these guns is the gauntlet, which is basically a glove with a spinning saw blade on it. Its usually a two or three hit kill but its always fun to kill someone with it. also there are several other items that can be placed on the maps such as +5, +25 and +50 health capsules, +5 armour shards, +50 and +100 armour vests, a mega health capsule, a quad damage power-up, as well as a regeneration power-up and a beast power-up. I won't take the time to explain these items (Most of which are pretty self explanatory anyway). The best piece of advice that I can give you is to aim well. You aim well and you win....Anyway I thoroughly reccomend this game to all and I hope this review helps.			"

												Quake III Arena (1998) is a memorable classic in my opinion. Consider this game if you enjoy classics and fast paced FPS gameplay. Even though I think Quake Live is a clone of this which makes it pointless to pay for this.Quake 3 Arena combines FPS gameplay with extreme speed of reflection and extreme-pace gameplay. As with old games, the game does not have much variation and no customization in comparison to today's games, but can still be a great fun.The gameplay consists of players; humanoid shaped hitboxes that move at a very fast speed without penalties, with a weapon selection including a rocket launcher, a railgun (one-hit precision killer), a shotgun and a few machine guns. The game modes at least include DM, TDM and CTF, not sure about others.The gameplay is just about maneuvering and shooting very quickly and precisely. When you die, you respawn right away and the insanely fast fun continues.			"

No time to relax and smell the flowers, this demands your full attention. But it wont give you a headache from so many tactics because there are not really many to begin with. But if you are an adrenaline gamer like myself this game is for you. Be sure to drink your favorite sugary drink and turn on some speed metal because you'll have the thrill of your summer! 9/10			"

												To many, including myself, Quake is almost a religion.It's not about hats, it's not about no-scoping, it's not about hurling verbal abuse at other players- It's about fun. And kicking ♥♥♥, fo course.The game that defined multi-player lies before you. Picking up on the massive success of Quake 2's run-n-gun style, ID focuesed an entire game on turning your fellow man into pixelated cuts of meat.Playing this game, even for a few moments, you can feel the raw creativity of ID. The level design, the balanced weapons, the interesting characters and the un-breakable engine make Quake III a simply un-missable game.The single player revolves around you blasting bots into high heaven, and now a days, the multiplayer is only occupied by elite Quake-gods.So i reconmend you go onto your internet browser and Download QUAKE LIVE: It's a free Quake 3. And you can play without getting your ♥♥♥ handed to you.Brothers, Sisters, buy this game. Buy it now. Buy it and fall in love with Quake.			"

Awesome arenas, 9 different weapons, important power-ups and a bazillion of possible strategies mixed up with good old skill will take your Multiplayer experience to a whole new level.

												When I played Quake for the first time I can't really say that I fell in love with it at first sight. I guess it's because I was expecting something more ""realistic"" like Wolfenstein (yeah, I know, at least for the most part of it). Either way, that was because so far I never had the experience of playing anything online. Back in the day I had this friend who eventually convinced me to give it a try. After I started, it didn't take long for me to get hooked on it. Time passed by and someday Quake II was released. Then again, when I tried for the first time I felt kinda disappointed with the game and can't deny that I still feel somehow like that after all those years (I guess it's because I missed that ""medieval environment"" touch from the first one). Anyway, when I first heard of Quake III, I didn't quite know what I should expect. I just read about the premise that the game was developed to be focused on the multiplayer experience. The irony was that although this title had exactly that concept in mind, that was the only one that I never had the chance to play with other people. Hmm what is there to say? For me it felt like a polished version of Quake II's multiplayer and later it wasn't hard to compare it with Unreal Tournament (which I won't deny that I liked better). Besides that, back then there were some really interesting mods involving the game's engine, like for example ""Bid for Power"", which had some DBZ characters and levels to play on. Overall, it's not a bad game, you can even play it casually if you're not in the mood to go through a whole set of matches.			"

												This is one of the franchises that I hold closest to my heart.Although it is my considered opinion that Quake 3 played second fiddle to the first Unreal Tournament, I can't deny this game. Why? Because you will not find a second fiddle anywhere near this damn good game. Hell, you won't find many first fiddles either. Honest to God: I love this game.I honestly think the era of arena shooters was too short for its own good. Although I have high hopes for the new Unreal Tournament, it might not bring the arena shooter back to the mainstream stage as many have hoped. I hope it does, but I understand it has a lot to live up to.This game has spectactular gunplay that is expected of the Quake series, that fast paced, adrenaline rushing gameplay that made arena shooters fun.The map DM17, otherwise known as The Longest Yard has become one of the most iconic FPS maps, ranking alongside Unreal Tournament's Facing Worlds. There's just no words to describe that feeling of launching off of a boost pad and sniping your enemy in midair with the Railgun. The music fits the game extremely nicely, as do the environments. The computer opponents give you some pretty amusing dialouge during the single player campaign. So what are you waiting for?Get out there and make your enemies Quake in fear!Doom got a remake, Unreal Tournament is in the works, so all we need are Half Life 3 and Quake 5 and the 90's can be here once again!A good old dose of pure 90's fun.

												No FPS game has ever been better, no FPS game ever will be better.If this was a real life bloodsport you'd all watch it, so you may as well buy it. It's the only way you're seeing aliens, robots and mutants get gibbed to bits with lasers and rockets. Let the inner bloodthirst live vicariously through video games.			"

Mean Mr. Mustard's short Quake III Arena review 1) Essential - buy it NOW 2) Recommended - buy it on sale 3) AvoidTime to complete – N/A (Played this a fair bit back in the day)Played multiplayer? NoWorth revisiting? Yes, always fun to play a few roundsBest part – The level of balance throughout the game is impeccable, from the level design to the weapons. Arena shooter in the purest formWorst part – More 'serious' than it's rival Unreal Tournament, whether that's a pro or a con is up to you			"

												What can I say? It's Quake! Although Quake III is the least played Quake I've played, it Definitely still deserves all kinds of credit. What I wouldn't give to experience playing Quake III back in 2001 when this was the hottest of the hottest. This game is very fun, I do play it sometimes, but not very much. Most servers are empty, but you can get Quake Live, their servers are full all the time. This the ultimate online multiplayer classic. The seeding game for Team Fortress (which is one of my favorite games) and a blast to play 03:00 AM in the morning with friends.			"

												This game is still very playable today with widescreen HD patches (like ioquake3). Because the AI is still great, the single player campaign is still very addictive. Environments with all the multi-textures are still gorgeous even in today's standards. Other than Rage and Doom 3, ID Software's last best game.			"

												Quake III Arena (1998) is a memorable classic in my opinion. Consider this game if you enjoy classics and fast paced FPS gameplay. Even though I think Quake Live is a clone of this which makes it pointless to pay for this.Quake 3 Arena combines FPS gameplay with extreme speed of reflection and extreme-pace gameplay. As with old games, the game does not have much variation and no customization in comparison to today's games, but can still be a great fun.The gameplay consists of players; humanoid shaped hitboxes that move at a very fast speed without penalties, with a weapon selection including a rocket launcher, a railgun (one-hit precision killer), a shotgun and a few machine guns. The game modes at least include DM, TDM and CTF, not sure about others.The gameplay is just about maneuvering and shooting very quickly and precisely. When you die, you respawn right away and the insanely fast fun continues.			"

It's not like the other shooters, you got a perfect movement & weapon feeling. It's quite challenging, it's a game you wan't to play doesn't matter for how long. I wish I would have seen it earlier in steam! 10/10 points! Just go on & give it a try it's worth!			"

												This is what the unreal tournaments try to live up to. It set the bar high, so long ago. Even with the outdated textures I find myself coming back to this game when I want a pure FPS experience. Gameplay uber alles!BTW: I'm playing on Win 7 (x64); the intro vids don't display but the game runs great. Not sure if I had to find a work-around for this as it's been a long time in my inventory but it's definitely playable through steam.Platforms TDM FTW!			"

												My most favorite game of all time and the first game I ever played. Started playing on LAN with my oldest brother when I was 3 years old. Now, I'm 19 with the Quake 3 symbol on my chest and will always love this game and remember how epic it is. I still play it as well as Quake Live when I can. I invested hours into this game growing up and wish I would have been more consistent playing it and practicing so I would have been better by now but I had fun and still do when I play it. I remember watching Fatal1ty and Own-age when I was growing up and thinking they were gods at the game (they were) and I was ecstatic to have the chance to play against Fatal1ty at Quakecon in 2012. My love for this game got me into FPS games and the experience that Quakecon brings and I couldn't be more thankful. I've been to 3 Quakecons so far and make it a point to play tons of Quake when I'm there. It just feels right. If you've never played Quake and want to experience what a real FPS is like or what a heavenly fast paced shooter is like, play it...seriously.			"

												Tired of the slow-paced, horribly inbalanced, camper friendly shooters of today? Then why not take a step back in time and play one of the most glorious arcade shooters of all time. Quake III is an extremely faced-paced twitch shooter, with game modes such as : Capture the flag, deathmatch, and team deathmatch to test your mettle. If you're looking for a shooter that relies on experience and skill, then this is it. With a steady hand and an itchy trigger finger, you'll find yourself having one of the most exhilarating experiences FPS has to offer.			"
