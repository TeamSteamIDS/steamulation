												I did not expect very much when I purchased this game.  This game was a pleasant surprise.   Although the genre is describedas action, the requirements for success are sufficient to classify Battlestations Midway as action/strategy.   The ability to controlvirtually every ship and aircraft in each scenario provides a variety of means to achieve the objectives.   At the same time youcan control all of the action and strategy with the use of the tactical map.  You have plenty of options.  In addition to the campaign, that  begins with Pearl Harbor and concludes with the last two scenarios at Midway, the ship challenge, planechallenge, and the submarine challenge will certainly test your skills as they are fairly difficult.  I highly recommend this game.			"

												This review is not really much of a review. I aim this at trying to be more helpful to people who already bought the game and were disappointed. Review part:Play this game if you love older flight sims, naval sims, strategy and micromanagement. Do not play this game if you expect an easy flight sim, easy RTS, easy naval sim, or easy sub sim. Nothing about this game is easy, it tries to do many things at once and does them all well. The challenge is in managing every little thing. Me trying to be helpful part:Tips and Tricks:1: You have finite resources, manage them well. Use fighters as bombers by equipping them with bombs, use bombers as fighters by enabling CAP (Combat air patrol), and don't send your ships into the slaughter single file. 2: Damage control isn't a myth. There is actually a damage control screen. Pay attention to your ships issues and fix them accordingly in battle.3: This game also has a RTS component. Use your map to issue orders. Your map is your friend, and your AI will hit more often than they miss (Excluding with free fire torpedos which are more likely to sink friendlies.) 4: You have to lead your targets and have a basic grasp of physics and timing. Physics is real in this game. Your speed, the speed of your target, and your overall range is not calculated for you excluding aircraft. Sometimes you have to shoot at open water now to hit your target 5 seconds later. 4.5: This can often be negated by aiming at the waterline on the very front of the enemy ship. This will usually make your shots hit their engine room and bring them to a full stop, or slow them down enough for your shots to hit their mag and blow them up. 5: Friendly fire is real, you can kill your own people. Do not shoot torpedos at enemy vessels that happen to be engaging friendlys opposite of you. Crossfire hurts. Hell, you can shoot down friendly aircraft with unlucky artillery blasts, you can dive bomb the plane you are flying by running into your bomb as it falls, I once had my own B-17 crew take out an entire group of my own torpedo bombers. 6: Use binoculars for everything you can, all the time, always. Just use them. They help. Seriously, use them. The things you see through called binoculars. These things you can see through, they can zoom, use them. Do it. If you don't, you have no reason to complain about missing your shots.  Upon reading the reviews, I realized that so many people dislike the game for BS reasons.""The controls are awkward!""That's easy to fix by hitting esc and changing your controls. ""The battles feel uneven in single player!""They are, as they are meant to be. Do you really want a game where you *Always* have an unfair advantage?""The graphics suck""Keep in mind the scale of the game and its age, not to mention the price you are getting it at.""I can't tell when my guns are reloading!""Yes, you can. If the little green dots aren't green, either that gun is reloading, damaged, or they don't have line of sight. Yes, line of sight is a real thing, it's a real issue. Guns on the back of your ship can't shoot targets in front of you. Get sideways. ""I can't fly!""The flight controls aren't arcade. Try to use your rudder rather than constantly banking. ""I can't shoot down enemy aircraft!""In air to air combat: Try to attack from above. Theres a little circle to shoot at, shoot at that, not the aircraft itself. On surface craft: There are range limitations, be sure to target them, be sure to only shoot at them when they are entering range. That being said, the negative reviews have some good points. The story is short, the gameplay is dated, the engine is old, mulitplayer no longer has a legit existance and so on. Still, it's $7 unbundled when not on sale, and an amazing game for its price and age.			"

												This is a old game, but I believe this is the best single player modern naval battle game so far. Players are able to control a abundant kinds of ships including Aircarft Carrier, Battleship, Heavy/Light Cruiser, Destroyer and even Submarine.The campaign is a little short but interesting and challenging, movies between battles are so well-made. Besides them, there are some challenge game enriching the game content. Game control was tricky at first, but really fun to play when you manage.Anyway, it is a great game for navy fans.			"

												I used to play this game a whole lot back when it first came out on Xbox 360, so I decided to give it a shot yet again. First things first, the tutorial missions may just be the most boring thing I have ever had to do in a video game. They take for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ever, but I will admit they are very useful to learn about all the things you can do in this game, which is of course their purpose. They honestly just should have found a way to make an almost 45 minute tutorial fun. Once you get into the real game though, you are automatically hit with one of the most cheesy, awful video game campaign stories ever with laughably bad dialogue and characters that look like plastic dolls and act like them too. Henry Walker and Donald's bromance makes the bromance from Pearl Harbor not look like the worst thing to come out of movies in the early 2000s. Everything else about the story is forgettable, but it does stay true to what happened in World War II's early pacific campaign which I guess gives it a few points. Graphics-wise, as mentioned earlier, it looks pretty terrible but the game is from 2007, basically 2006, so you gotta let it slide. Plus graphics don't make a game anyway.So I just trashed everything not important about this game, but I had to get it out. The gameplay is actually extremely fun, and even would I dare say replayable. It's a shame the campaign is so short, but this replayability definitely helps that fact. Some missions are just so much fun to play that its nice to go back every once and awhile to play again. However, if you are not playing on the highest difficulty (and normal on some missions), the game is laughably easy. I kind of like playing on easy though because it lets you focus on destroying every single unit the Japanese have in store without dying. The plane gameplay is extremely fun and very much like arcade mode on War Thunder, just with a lot less realism. This is definitely not some flight simulator, because I don't think the things I pull off sometimes in those planes are actually possible. Submarines are also a blast to play as for obvious reasons, they just don't show up in the campaign enough is the sad thing. Captaining boats is not the most fun thing in the world, but it could be worse. It is usually in boats, mainly aircraft carriers, where you use a lot of the tactical stuff this game has to offer. These real time strategy parts of the game are what keep it from being another average war game, and they are very well done and easy to use. Just get ready for a whole bunch of multi-tasking if you are playing on higher difficulties. There are also special missions for each class (sub, plane, ship) that are unrelated to the story though, and they are usually fun but much more difficult than the main campaign.All in all, even though this review starts with a bunch of negative stuff, everything I blasted is basically irrelevant to the game. If you are looking for a game that is a lot of fun through and through, this is one to definitely consider. I recommend this mainly for all into war games, World War II's pacific campaign (the game isn't a history channel documentary but it'll do), tactical games, and games like War Thunder, but basically anyone can probably pick this up and enjoy it. 7/10 from me. I am looking forward to trying out its sequel for the first time, Battlestations: Pacific.			"

												This game is fun, especially if you like battleships.I've always been obsessed with naval, aerial, and ground operations of the second world war.And I find this game to be not as unrealistic as I first assumed.~Ship/Sub mechanics and controls are GREAT~Airplane mechanics are meh~Airplane controls are pretty bad, and take a lot of getting used to before you can actually start comletely missions. However this game is rather old, which makes it amazing for it's time.I give it a 9/10.* Deducted the one point because of the lack of a free play mode and aggravating controls for airplanes.For a buck it's great.It's worth like 10 - 20 for what you get.

												I already have this game on disc but I just cannot get it to load these days, it just sits there ""installing"" but never gets any further. I remember it was always a difficult game to install from the disc with various crashes and hangups and that was before you got to the Windows Live fun and games.So I thought I'd gamble with my money and try it out on Steam. Many of the reviews have talked about problems with the game,but I have to say I've had no problems at all, which surprised me a little or a lot. It downloaded and installed quickly and I've played a few hours now and its fantastic, better than I remembered and with the newer  hardware these days it looks  and plays great.I'm glad I took the risk and now I can't pull myself away from the damned game.

												This game is fantastic, playing as a submarine online and trying to stay hidden in the depths while firing torpedos at your enemies is pretty intense.There are a wide variety of ships, planes and submersibles all manually controllable for you to sink, kamikaze or stay too long under water with (thus suffocating due to lack of oxygen or getting crushed due to the pressure of the depths if you go too low) and many different ways of taking them out.The game uses things like sonar, amount of munitions, level of depth and crew management to keep you constantly on your toes as you fight to dodge incoming artillery/torpedos/depth charges, sink and destroy enemy ships, bases, planes and submarines and ponder the worth of flying your plane directly into the enemy or risking heading back to the airfield/carrier to restock on explosives.In short, it's a wonderful game that was ahead of its time and still holds up well to this day. True there are other games like World of Warships that try to do something similar, but they still come off as shallow imitations (albeit a little prettier in the graphics department).If you're looking for the ultimate navy/aircraft battle simulator, then look no further, for this is it.Added Bonus - For extra fun in multiplayer, grab control of the little 3 man boats (that can be destroyed by something as tiny as flak from a ship) and try to pull off successful torpedo runs on enemy BBs (heavy battleships), it is a difficult and perilous task, but if you can master it then you can be the nautical equivalent of David and Golliath.

You are fighting against the japanese, who were attacking your base and destroying your country. You are going to take revenge and kill them! You are playing on one time on a ship, the other moment an airplane. The airplane controls are really bad. The ships controls are fine.Lot of variety.Lot of loading menu's.The scrolling up and down are reversed and you have to manually change it.The graphics were pretty good for a 2007 game.Video is decent for a 2007 game.There is a difficulty settings.Subtitles are voiced over.

You have to look past the horrendously plastic looking characters in the otherwise still-bad videos, and underneath you'll actually find some really fun, challenging, varied warfare -- from piloting planes in air-to-air and air-to-ground combat, from single small PT boats to destroyers with artillery and anti-aircraft flak, to commanding entire fleets!Missions are varied well so you do a variety of tasks with both planes and ships.  Despite not doing the ""Naval Academy"" missions as I didn't know that was the tutorial missions in the game, I picked up on the controls and the way to play the game easy enough; though I do wish I had done the Tutorial as there's a ship repair screen I still don't really understand.  The game actually has a lot to do in it and is pretty well done!You can take command of individual pieces in the war (a specific plane, ship, etc) or more manage the war from the map and just tell the pieces where to go.  It's fabulous what you can do.The GOOD:+ Great missions with a good variety of goals+ You can take control of many individual pieces:  planes (in air-to-air, air-to-ground, and air-to-ship combat), and ships (using AA guns, torpedos, depth charges, and artillery)+ You can manage the entire fleet from the map and let the computer control the individual pieces+ The game offers 3 skill levels for the missions and the ""Regular"" offered a good challenge.  I had to redo several missions a number of times.+ It's a good length of a game.  My campaign lasted 10 hours (and that's not counting the various training missions, or the other 11 challenge missions)+ The graphics.  Even factoring in the release date of the game, I think the game (gameplay) looks pretty good; better than I was expecting given its age.  The videos, granted, are terrible on a variety of levels.+ Has multiplayer, but hadn't tried it at all, but it's nice they put MP in the game.The ""OK"":~ Story.  The settings and missions themselves were great, but the videos between the missions where they tell the story of your character; that was borderline at best.~ Some missions are a little long, and being new at the game and a good challenge, if you loose, that was almost an hour you have to redo.  (Ahem, a couple more times in my case cuz I didn't want to go down to Easy!)~ I had to change the controls from the defaults on a few different pieces (eg: planes controls seem to be inverted for mouse anyway); but the game does allow you to change them to whatever.~ Planes don't seem all that manouverable when flying manually.  It was a challenge for me just to fly the plane and even SEE the enemy at times.  :-D~ Some control screens just aren't intuitive such as the ship repair screen.  Granted there's a tutorial, but it's a single screen; you'd think I could figure it out, but ... I'm not really sure what effect my changes are having.~ The UI isn't the most intuitive either.  Again, it may have been covered in the tutorial, but the red/green circles by the targeting crosshairs; that took a bit to figure out.  (Number of circles = how many turrets/torpedos you have.  Red Circle = a particular turret/torpedo can't fire in the direction aiming, Green Circle means the turret/torpedo is ready to fire.  Red Flashing Circle means that turret/torpedo is reloading.)The BAD:- The videos.  You really have to get past your plastic looking people in the animations and just enjoy the missions themselves.  Thankfully the videos and the gameplay are completely and totally different.I'm so glad I stuck with it to try the rest of the missions and look past the videos / story.  Overall 7.5 / 10. "

												my most played naval multiplayer game before world of warships.  in many ways the mechanics of BSM are vastly superior to world of warships because the devs actually knew what they were doing in designing the game and how to properly balance all the classes.  Carrier/Battleships are the top classes as they should be and cruisers/destroyers fill a support role in assiting there capital ships because without proper teamwork in BSM your going to have a very bad day.   its nice that solo warrior play is punished like it should be unlike wows where its encouraged which is very backwards and when i talk about wows balance i get very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is. litterally in wows solo cruisers cant be punished by a carrier...seriously im not kidding. cruisers with the worst AA compared to a Carrier/Battleship cant be touched by aircraft which is a huge middle finger for anyone who likes proper naval games. this game has so much potentional if only it got noticed it would easily beat world of warships.

												Battlestations Midway is an older game that still holds up over time. You take the role of a young navy lieutenant commanding a PT Boat during the Assault on Pearl Harbor. The campaign follows his rise to command from Pearl Harbor to the Midway campaign. For gameplay, you can command from the Tactical Map or personally take charge of the fight. Ship controls are easy enough, but the fighter controls are not the easilest to control using a mouse. The game has ship, fighter, and submarine challenges in addition to its campaign. I recommend it for players who like military history or want a quick diversion from the real world. This ran without any problems on my Windows 7 computer, but I did not mess with the multiplayer aspect of the game. "

												I have over 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews - Game 22Battlestations: MidwayPurchase Date: 7/23/2014I picked this up as part of the Humble Square Enix Bundle.  I admit normally I don't play World War II games, although I've always had a soft spot for the original Battlefield 1942, so I was curious to see if this game would be similar.For my hour review, I played the US Campaign.  The game offered a multiplayer option based on Gamespy, but that is now defunct, and I don't know if there is a workaround for this or not.  If you are looking specifically for multiplayer, you likely will want to look at a newer game, or do some research to see if there are any workarounds for Gamespy.The first campaign mission takes place at Pearl Harbor as the Japanese are first attacking.  Bookending each of the mission segments are video cutscenes, which bounce back and forth between the style of a historical documentary, and from the perspective of an individual soldier.Missions are broken up into segments, and in the starting segment I found myself driving a boat while also shooting at Japanese planes which are bombing the harbor.  It was a little tricky at times trying to aim the guns at planes in the sky while also trying to pilot the boat.  Often I would be at an angle where I couldn't actually see where the boat was going, and found myself ramming other ships at times.The first mission does a pretty good job of also doubling as a tutorial.  Each segment changes the vehicle being piloted and/or the vehicles the Japanese are in.  I piloted a boat for one segment, and was flying a plane of my own in another.  I shot at planes mostly, but there were also times I fought other boats or a submarine.I originally started playing with mouse and keyboard, but I wasn't the biggest fan of the controls, so I ended up switching to my XBox 360 controller, which the game also supports.  The game does also let you tweak the control scheme, which I was grateful for particularly in the flying segment where I could reverse the axis for making the plane climb and dive.One minor complaint I had is the game will occasionally give you visual cues on what to do (such as switching weapons to a depth charge to target a submarine).  The cue is supposed to include which key to press, but with the XBox controller it would occasionally display a blank space in place of the actual button, leaving me to have to use trial and error to figure it out.Overall the game is pretty straightforward.  The controls are not very complicated, and the mission objectives themselves were not that involved, at least to start with.  I definitely get the impression that things will get more involved as the game progresses, but in my first hour of play the game kept things pretty simple.My least favorite part of the game was the airplane combat.  Even with the XBox controller I struggled with the controls.  I had to restart this mission segment quite a number of times as I kept crashing.Overall I think the game is decent by today's standards, and even better judged by the time it came out.  Given the budget pricing, I think makes for a good value.			"

												The most polite way to put it is that I don't dislike this game. The graphics are decent, the cut-scenes are well done, and the first couple of missions really pulled me in and captured my excitement. But as the game story progressed, the excitement quickly wore off leaving me uncommitted to continue. Each battle became frustratingly harder, even with the difficulty setting on easy. There was no ability to save the game mid-mission which left me with a lingering bitterness every time I had to restart (which was quite often). A worthy attempt, but the developers just couldn't close the deal for me making it a tolerable air/sea shooter at best.			"

												I came across this awhile ago, and before I got into playing World of Warships (free-to-play). For the time it came out, and for the campaign, I think its pretty good. As long as you remember the graphics aren't as fancy as the game is from 2007, it is an enjoyable game. Plus I like how you can switch to another aircraft or ship mid-battle, and continue to fight that same battle. You don't have that in WoWS, as in WoWS when you get sunk you have to wait for the battle to end or switch to another ship in port. Overall, a pretty fun game!			"

												This is quite a few ""simulators"" in one. You can fly a plane, ride a battleship, dive a (not yellow) submarine and use an AA boat. All of them are really neat (although airplanes are a little ehh). There are multiple types of those watercrafts/planes. Those types that you expect to take part of World War 2 are obviously present.Now gameplay-wise it's really fun and a tad challenging, but nothing frustrating. If you even find it a bit appealing, I'd say give it a go, you'll probably like it.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												Midway owns a special area in gaming, putting you in the Pacific theatre of WW2 and offering you all of the sea/air machines involved on both sides. It does this with more scope than BF1942's gameplay, and is more arcade balanced than a serious simulator. That's not to say it's devoid of tactics/management, and a need for well timed accuracy and judgement. It's a game far from perfect in it's execution, having a limited amount of freedom by limiting itself to set campaign missions and a few challenges. It lacks singleplayer skirmishes, which multiplayer makes up for as being the most engaging multiplayer I've experienced in a game(if you can find anyone online). Overall it's a game simple in design and full of charm. I come back to it for that feeling of being in a torpedo bomber alongside my AI wingmen, getting as close as I can to the battleship that's about to ruin my mission, knowing I can't afford to miss, and might get shot down if I get too close. The entire battle hangs on those few seconds of judgement.			"

**THIS GAME DOES NOT WORK IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GAMESPY ACCOUNT [GAMESPY DOWN]**

My first impressions of this game is that the cutscenes and graphics are suprisingly amazing for a 2007 game.
The gameplay is really enjoyable, you take control of attack boats, and gunner planes while shooting down Japanese military forces.
The campaign takes place during the the attack on Pearl Harbor with two playable protagonists.

The multiplayer does not work because the shutdown of GameSpy, and if you try to register or log in to your previous account you'll get the game stuck in limbo until you delete your profile and make another without GameSpy activated.

The missions definately get more challenging, and I find myself trying to use special artillary or missles that never work so I'm stuck with a machine gun that doesn't do any damage to larger ships so I get f***ed.

Overall a pretty fun game, and look forward to the sequel.

												This is another one of those games that isn't particularly bad as far as gameplay goes. It's got solid controls for the ships, and decent controls for planes. Nothing spectacular. What really makes the game less-than-stellar for me is the main campaign. You learn about all these tactical maneuvers in the especially-long tutorial, and I was getting geared up for a lot of fun, even fights. Were they fun? Arguably. Were they even? Hardly. There are plenty of missions where I could only control so many ships that can produce so many planes, and yet the Japanese have far more ships and planes than I do, and just launch them off like they're nothing more than paper planes, which really throws me off and had me frustratingly banging my head against my laptop screen as my ship would fail because I only had fifteen planes, and the Japanese had about thirty. Of course, I died! Only a complete idiot could kill twice as many planes as their own with THESE flight mechanics! But what about the story that connected all these assorted battles over small, generic Phillipine islands over massive bodies of water? It was alright. It wasn't Oscar-winning material. It got the job done. Although, I will say that while the graphics look a step ahead of the rest of the game in the cutscenes, the animation is very stiff and robotic. I laughed during a scene where the protagonist nearly drinks some whiskey with his commanding officer, and they both raise their glasses like two preprogrammed machines. And, also the game tries to show the Japanes and Americans as equals, while at the same time completely undermining their message. I find a photograph that a Japanese pilot kept of his family (incredibly convenient, I might add), while the Japanese are shown in the cutscenes to be in the shadows, and being given a menacing look. Almost like they're inhuman demons that deserve to be shot down. I mean, this isn't Full Metal Jackets! This is a video game! We have to have SOME motivation for the player to actually kill these guys, right? ... We do, don't we?			"

												An interesting diversion when there is nothing else to play, Battlestations: Midway, allows you to helm ships, and pilot fighter craft, in various World War II Scenario's. The controls are simple, the objectives are straight-forward, and the story is a generic blend of historical information and through the eyes of a fictional sailor/soldier/pilot. It isn't bad, though the graphics are simple, but it probably isn't worth the money as a stand-alone game. There are many other military-styled or historically themed games, which are more dynamic and better quality. My advice, save up for one of those.			"

												Battlestations hasn't aged well.The graphics are barely appealing, but the gameplay feels like it was made in the N64 era.If you're expecting responsive air controls like War Thunder, you'll be dissapointed, the planes handle like a stack of plates.Warships move as you would expect, but firing with them is an absolute nightmare, half the time I'm wandering if my guns are firing at all.tl;dr It was good in 2007, but it is unplayable by today's standards.

												Action game that puts you in command of either a fighter/bomber plane, a destroyer ship, submarine, pt boat and control an aircraft carrier in Real-Time Strategy style. I had a little fun with this game and I'm sure I would've had a lot more pleasure with Battlestations: Midway if the controls were tuned and actually working properly!PROS:+Switching from controlling planes to ships to submarines is fun (but unexplained in the game... actually found out by mistyping another keystroke!).+Actual combat is pretty fun (once you get the hang of it).CONS: -Awful and questionnable controls. -Visuals both in graphical quality and models are very dated and bad looking (2007 ain't that far no?)-Gameplay can be hard at times (difficulty spikes). -Learning curve is extreme (aside from the PT Boat tutorial, you're left on your own afterwards). -Game speed is way too slow. (takes forever to reach your target only to fail and have to start all over again 'repeatedly' is frustrating. -Campaign is short and rather dull.RECOMMENDATION: I would not recommend this game to anyone other than WWII purists and even then, you surely can find better alternatives out there! Best recommendation would be to get World of Warplanes and/or War Thunder instead... much better alternatives!RATING:5.0 / 10			"

												Best part is that JFK is in this game but you don't assasinate him in this title.Its really boring and out of touch though. The writing and VO is cringe worthy and not in a funny way. Just in a ridiculously lame sort of way. The actual gameplay thus far has been slow and mind numbingly boring but has seemed like just the tutorial still. Why is there so much tutorial if that is the case? Its so boring!			"

												An old, but still brilliant game to spend some days for the campaign (it even has a plot!), and to try yourself in separate challenges. Graphics seem pretty even today (I really like just to give orders and observe the battlefield, admiring dogfights in the skies with flaming debris dropping from the heavens), and gameplay is captivating. Just imagine: you guide an aircraft carrier, give orders for B-17s to ruin enemy airfield and for torpedo bombers to hit an enemy destroyer, jump to the Flying Fortress to direct bombs yourself, switch to the Avenger to close in and drop a torpedo, change the formation of your squadron, jump to your cruiser, and fire a salvo at the enemy patrol boat - and all this happens in 2 minute time!However, there are some minor setbacks. Firstly, AI of your units is stupid. Fighters and ships can put a decent fight, but bombers... I don't really remember many times when my torpedo bombers managed to hit (not to sunk, merely to hit) a target smaller than an aircraft carrier. However, behavior of your rivals is much more commendable, and they are always coming in great numbers to give you a hard time. Secondly, although the game is fairly easy, in some missions you will have to act quick, because if you don't, enemy reinforcements won't leave you a chance to complete mission. And thirdly, I have had some problems with sound in the in-game videos, so I had to tune settings a bit to bring it back.			"

												Its a decent game! The AI is smart enough not to ditch their plane into the side of the mountain even if you do, so thats a plus. The battleship missions are the best, hang in there! No real bugs to speak of. The voice overs sound like a single person in a studio, but the mouth movement and animations are better than I've seen in current games from 2015. There isn't much for story depth, so really the game is a handful of random - historically inspired - missions.Pros:*Intelligent AI*Battleship missions*No bugs/crashesIf you're looking for, stay away:*Incredible story*Depth*Realism			"

												This is everything I've ever hoped for in a ship sim packed into one game. The learning curve is a bit steep despite the tutorials teaching you nearly every aspect of the game. Once you get thrown in at Pearl Harbour though, things get serious very fast. A logical progression of ships and a storyline that is short but interesting gives this game quality. The individual challenges test your abilities as a ship captain and add to the otherwise short campaign.			"

												What a really fun game. I played this on the Xbox 360 when I was younger and thought it was stupid. After getting it on sale and playing it all again, I saw that younger me was wrong. This game is a fun way to re-live a lot of the WW2 ship battles between the US and Japan. It lets you control all types of ship classes from PT boats all the way up to the huge carriers. You can swap between ships and planes (when you can control them) to be able to do more than just sit in the water.The difficulty scales up through the campaign fairly well. It starts you out easy but by the end, the matches can go for more than 30 minutes a level. I would recommend getting this game if you are into WW2 history and naval combat.			"
