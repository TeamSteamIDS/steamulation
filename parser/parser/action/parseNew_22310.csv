												This is by far one of the best piles of♥♥♥♥♥♥I have ever had the pleasure of playing. I have no idea what the ♥♥♥♥ is happening at any time in the story. The main character, Richard Marcinko, is one of the funniest people you will ever see. Every 5 seconds, he is shouting some random curse words at the enemy, calling them ""♥♥♥♥♥♥breath commy mother ♥♥♥♥ers"" or things along the lines of that. But aside from that, the game is just a below average FPS. The enemy A.I. is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and won't react when you RUN up behind them and get a ""stealth kill"". The game is also amazingly short.... It took me a groundbreaking 1 hour and 30 minutes to beat the entire thing. The refund time limit is 2 hours, so technically, you could just buy this game, beat it, and refund it in the same day. This game also has a multiplayer which I didn't even consider trying... No one is playing this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥online. Overall, I 100% reccomend this game to anyone into the ""So bad it's good"" type of stuff. I had a blast playing this game and loved almost every moment of it.And you can just refund it after you beat it.10/10Would call North Koreans and Russians random profanities again			"

												Rogue Warrior is horrible. Beyond Mickey Rourke's hilarious voice acting, this game is linear, poorly programmed, and very shallow. Now, that's not to say that it's not at least an enjoyable experience, but you need to know what you're getting into before you buy it, for hopefully a price below $10. I beat the game in under 3 hours, and that was with me being killed many times in certain levels. The enemies are extremely repetetive, and pose no challenge unless they gang up on you.♥♥♥♥♥♥(protagonist) moves around like a tank. The ""stealth"" aspect of this game is laughably broken. You can run up to every enemy, making as much noise as you want and kill them with a prompt that appears on the screen. The sound broke for me towards the end, which ruined the ending cutscenes. Grenades rarely ever work in this game, they're pitiful. The grenade launcher is also a piece of garbage and may kill you more often than save you. Weapon selection is extremely limited. The levels design is boring and, again, very linear.With all this in mind, this is a game that is so bad it's good. I would recommend this game if you play it with a bunch of friends just to laugh at how stupid it is. Mickey Rourke's voice acting ensures a few good laughs.""SUCK MY BALLS, MY HAIRY F*CKING BIG BALLS, WRAP THEM AROUND YOUR F*CKING MOUTH"" - real line in this game spoken by♥♥♥♥♥♥Marcinko (voiced by Mickey Rourke)			"

												*EDIT READ BOTTOM*To the People who enjoyed the books-Keep reading them.=========================After some time with the game and hating it's shallow gameplay, and overall existance, I uninstalled it, and moved on to better or crappier games in my library. A few months later me and my friends have a 'bad game beatdown' and play a collection of overall s****y games, We played awful abominations such as Mindjack, Duke Nukem Forever, Two Worlds, Rambo, and Bodycount just to name a few. We had some fun just making fun of awful acting (Mindjack), terrible stories (FF XIII), and bad gameplay (insert s**t here). But The one game we had the most fun playing was Rogue Warrior. If you want a game with the word awful wriiten all over it, than look no further than this pile of s**t! Words cannot describe the laughter and noise me and my buds made while playing this game. It can be beaten in a single sitting, so during those 90 minutes, we had more fun than any other serious highly rated AAA shooter out in the market.  Rogue Warrior is still an awful game no matter what. But with some friends, It can turn into an unforgettable enjoyable experience.			"

												Rogue Warrior isn't that bad.I mean okay yeah it sucks♥♥♥♥♥♥and it's completely terrible but it isn't that bad.It's a game about shooting people and cursing. It's over in two hours, you uninstall it, you forget it ever happened.But really it isn't THAT bad. Kill some guys with guns, then run up slice the neck of the last man standing. That's actually kinda cool. There really isn't much of a difference between the first mission and the last mission. Actually I take that back, the last mission had more explosions. That's definitely an improvement. Did I mention the expletives? Yeah I did..♥♥♥♥♥♥...I mean damn there are a ♥♥♥♥ing lot of them. Mickey Rourke must have been legitimately♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at those wacky commies when he recorded his lines.Hey wait...Explosives and Expletives? That's a fine tag line for the game. There are stealth elements too. About all the guards are good at is spotting you. No joke, I saw a guard blow himself up with his own grenade. Like I said, the game isn't that bad. I've played supposedly better games that turned out to be less fun, precisely because they didn't have moments of absolutely wonderful stupidity.  The best part of the game is the ending credits theme, just look it up on youtube. It's like the 100+ people that developed and published this piece of crap were in on the joke. Hopefully nobody paid full price for this nonsense. I don't recommend this game at all, but it isn't that bad.			"

												One of the first things I noticed about Rogue Warrior was how good the music is. In a lot of games I end up turning off the music because it’s too depressing or repetitive. The music in this game is awesome, its genuinely cool and adds to the fun. Mickey Rourke did the voice acting, for the main character here, who’s name is Rourke. His dialogue and performance are hilarious. Even though he literally sounds, like he’s not bothered on some of the parts between levels. I really enjoy when games don’t take things too seriously and with Rogue Warrior this is definitely the case.I had to tweak things a little bit, so that I could play it, at a smooth 60FPS with no stuttering. It’s easy to find some information on this with a quick search. Having made these basic changes the game runs really well for me (my specs are on my profile). Rourke's 'ultimate badass' attitude is ridiculous in the most entertaining way. His dialogue is hilariously over the top and the violence is taken to a weird level. Even though it's poorly made, even for 2009 (it looks like a PS2 remaster), this somehow also adds to the 'so bad, it's good' charm of the game. The only thing that’s a bit annoying is the poor hit detection but it works ‘okay’ enough to still be fun. I’m also assuming  that this game was not full price on consoles back in 2009 because it is crazy short. This is fine for a cheap silly game on Steam but just know that this game is basic in it’s gameplay mechanics and over very quickly. It’s a fairly challenging game though, for what it is, if you’re not careful you will die a lot (even on the standard difficulty). In my opinion, some games try to be too dramatic and this can end up ruining the fun. Rogue Warrior doesn’t have that problem, at all. It's a blast and It captures something I love about videogames. Which is when the fantastically crap and ridiculous ends up being surreal and fun.P.S: Rourke climbs ladders like a ♥♥♥♥ing machine!!			"

												2008 was Bethesda's year of antithesis, due to the publication of fallout 3, the greatest game of all time, and Rebellion's Rogue Warrior, based on the american special forces legend, Richard ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; Marcinko and although the premise is good, the game itself is a big piece of crap!Seriously, the best way to describe Rogue Warrior is you go to a concert starring Rise Against, Metallica and Foo Fighters (Nice presentation), but Tim, James and Dave got all sick and cancelled at the moment (starting to dissapoint pretty badly) and so, to substitute, Justin Bieber, One Direction and Lady Gaga appeared (before it's over, 95% of the people either left or killed themselves).Anyways, starting with the story, there is none. It's just a bunch of missions and thats it (well, the missions are related, but a ""found these papers, going to the location mentioned in these papers to stop the enemies!"" doesn't really count as a story to me...).Moving to the graphics, they are very bad,  I mean, i've seen PS2 and older PC games from like 2005 or 06 that look better than this♥♥♥♥♥♥Going to the gameplay: There is a cover system! Rarity in FPS's these days, but it's over simplistic and it feels clunky as hell! I hoped it would be like Rainbow Six:Vegas 2 which was fine, perhaps even good...but nope! Rogue Warrior has you stick to cover pressing one button and thats it.Gunplay is horrendous, the guns feel absolutely terrible, and you might want to just stick to your silenced pistol and the melee moves, oh yeah! This game has a ""press E to win"" prompt btw and if you're skilled enough, you can go through 90% of the whole game just by getting up close and personal to the enemies and pressing E (you are not vulnerable during the animation, which is even easier!) the other 10% is just dull sniping the rest of the unreachable enemies with the knife. Don't get me wrong, the melee ""cutscenes"" aren't bad, teh animation are quite good, but after the 3rd one, it gets repetitive and stupid.Moving to Multiplayer! It completely sucks! It's over simplistic, just kill and thats it! Very old school styled (pick up the weapons you find on the ground or hidden places, there aren't classes or anything like that, like i said, very simplistic and boring), you don't gain experience nor anything, you dont get rewarded for doing good or punished for sucking and that makes it kind of...boring after 10 minutes. Also, noone is playing the Multiplayer of this game, it only has 850 game Hub contributions, so...yeah...it's THAT popular...With sucky multiplayer, bad graphicss, dull and exhausting gameplay and a 3 hour long campaign (no joke!) Rogue Warrior just deserves a 1/10, miserable disappointment. And Rebellion that does great games! I got it for 2,49 € and it still feels overpriced! BTW, the game reeks of a pretty bad console port! Don't buy this, please! Save your 2€ and go buy a sandwich, it lasts longer than this game!			"

												Rogue Warrior is one of the funniest games I have ever played (but it wasn't intentional on the developers part)Rogue Warrior follows on a navy seal♥♥♥♥♥♥Marcinko who is sent to North Korea to find some missiles that will be used to fight in the cold war.This game has now become infamous and if you don't know this game by know, oh my man you are missing out on of the funniest games of all time. There's not a lot of good, but I'll try to explain everything that's bad about this game.First of all the game is incredibly short. I finished it in an hour and this is not even a joke. The game is so flawed you can just sprint into every enemy, stab him and complete each level in under 5 minutes or even less. One of the reasons this game is well known is for Mickey Rourke's performance as♥♥♥♥♥♥ Every other sentence♥♥♥♥♥♥spews out profanity and it's absolutely hilarious. One of the reasons it's worth to check the game out is the non stop swearing. It get's tiresome really fast, but the game ends so fast that it doesn't matter by the end.The shooting in this game, is absolutely horrendous. Most of my shots didn't even connect when I was pointing at the enemies head at point blank range. It's better just to stab everyone you see.Graphically the game looks ugly. Low res textures, character models look ugly as hell and every enemy looks the same. There's also a multiplayer mode, but it's dead so I can't play it, but judging from the main game, it's probably also really really bad.Overall Rogue Warrior is a terrible terrible game. But the performance Mickey Rourke puts on is almost worth it to play the game at least once. On a sale I suggest checking it out, but otherwise stay away, cause this game is terrible.Final Rating:2.5/10Pros:+ Constant swearing by♥♥♥♥♥♥is hilarious (The ending rap is also really great)...Cons:- but it gets tiresome incredibly fast- Shooting is absolutely horrendous- Short - Graphics are ugly  "

												I got this game for about 40 cents in a bundle deal. I never bothered playing it until recently just to see how bad it is based on all the reviews. The reviews make it look like a completely unplayable mess, but it's actually . In fact, it has some things done better than a lot of FPS games:pros-Instantly recognized my 120hz monitor-Enemies have a painful animation when getting shot-Crazy humor & dialog-Cool violent executionsCons-Short, Can finish in under 2 hours on normal difficulty (Almost a good thing with how repetitive it is though)-Gets boring quickly-Few glitches (Some enemies run in to the level at a super speed like they're on fast forward)All in all, I'd give this a 4/10. It's kind of fun for a bit, and the guns all handle well. As for a rating of ""Reccommended to buy"", I'd only recommend when it goes on another crazy sale, and mainly to hear the crazy dialog through the game. Easily worth a buck for that :D			"

Clunky controls, dull graphics, useless plot, terrible level design, and a lack of weapon and enemy variety are only a few of this game's many problems. Lastly I would like to point out the ""Protaganist"" Richard Marcinko voiced by none other than Mickey Rourke who gives one of the laziest and lackluster performances I have ever seen. The mix of gritty and battle hardened Navy SEAL speak and utterly terrible one-liners is laughable at best.			"

The gameplay is ok It's a rip off of rainbow six using the cover system funs feel like water pistols which is always awesome. best part is that it's 2 hours long which is the best time I ever spent into a game It was truly outstanding. Rogue warrior Is probably my favorite fps of all time actually ♥♥♥♥ it best fps i've played Demo ♥♥♥♥ is the greatest game character alive We need rogue warrior 2 immediately!10/10 Game of the centuary.

												For some reason this game has a reputation for being ""one of the worst games ever"" and honestly after playing it I really don't see why. People are comparing this game to ones such as Big Rigs and that's almost unforgivable.Story is pretty typical military nonsense with a super tough protaganist (decently voiced by Mickey Rourke with some laughably hilarious dialogue) breaking onto an enemy base and basically shoot, put bombs on missles and that's the whole game. Sounds repetitive right? If it weren't for the decent kill scenes (sneaking up to enemies and pressing E) and the surprisingly fun gunplay this game wouldn't be even remotely as fun.The unlimited ammo for the silenced pistol was actually a decent touch that added a little bit to the game overall. (It did only take me an hour and a half to beat the campaign though which is pretty lackluster) and of course multiplayer is dead.All in all, cheesy shooter that'll make you laugh and keep you entertained for an hour or two. Worth 10 bucks? For me, I was relatively satisfied so I'm gonna go with yes. However if you don't like to laugh at mediocre games, wait for a sale to try this out. Most people who play this anyways are just achievement hunting.			"

Just a plain simple run n gun with no plot, bad graphics and a very short campaign.  Game was completed in around 5 hours.  The voice acting of the main charater (Demo♥♥♥♥♥♥ is done by Mickey Rourke and it is by far the funniest voice acting I have ever heard.  I think this game has a world record for the f bomb and other combinations of filfth.  You can YouTube the ending credits of this game and you will get an idea - they made a rap song out of it.  Though I am sounding critical this game was just alright to kill an afternoon and that was about it.  I just think it was not as bad as other people have suggested and critics have written about it.  I would pick it up for maybe $2.50 but people who paid $50+ I feel sorry for them.			"

THE LOWDOWN:Rogue Warrior is an old-skool corridor shooter with limited cover mechanics and minor stealth elements.  Your objective is to one-man Rambo; an eight mission campaign, set in the Peoples Republic of North Korea.  Choose to kill by stealth but be seen and its time for gun-toting action.  The campaign is single-player but it has a multi-player arena style deathmatch with a few maps.  THE GOOD:+ Simple gameplay. Other than picking up weapons/ammo, there is little to interact with.+ Fast-paced action.+ Cheesy voice-over from Mickey Rouke.  Some great one-liners.  Sounds like it was made while sitting on the crapper!+ Who doesnt like taking on PRK enemies!? ^^+ The music is old-skool tacky, gradually getting boom-tastic at the end.  Perfect for this game!+ Nice range of achievements which are fairly fast to gain.  + On sale its very cheap.THE BAD:- Its very short.  Too short!- Cliche backstory.  But who doesnt like them right!?- Scripted levels are purely linear.- Rudimentary graphics give it a minimalistic ambience.  Well its an old game.- Mostly similar enemies that just carry different firearms.- Enemies attack in waves but even on Elite difficulty numbers are very low.- Some MP achievements require other players.  At least four.  This is a problem to get them even if there are a few die-hards on the discussion boards.- Very limited replayability.  Everything is virtually the same the second time around.- No matter what weapons you pick up in the previous chapter, they are reset at the start of the next one.AND THE ORDINARY:* Gameplay is fairly one-dimensional apart from minor stealth and cover mechanics.* A.I is adequate but nothing to write home about.* Short 8 mission campaign.* 3 difficulty levels.  Just go to elite.  Its really not that difficult!* Lite in-game story-driven cutscenes.* Arena based PvP multiplayer. If youre into that sort of thing.  Unfortunately all but dead.* Carry 2 weapons but can choose from 13 different weapons (pistols, shotguns, SMGs, assault rifle, sniper rifle, LMG and a grenade-launcer.  Unfortunately none are realistically modelled or very satisfying to use.* Decent K/M controls.  Unbidden tendency for weapon-switching to occur with mouse-wheel.* You will need to complete the game three times; once at each difficulty to get 100%.VERDICT:Rogue Warrior is frankly terrible!  Its a mediocre FPS.  Ultimately limited by its age its levels are designed to be completely linear.  Gameplay decisions mostly fall as to whether to kill with silent takedowns or alert enemies and blast them with whatever weapons you have to hand.  However Its enjoyable in a minimalistic kind of way.  Just dont expect anything like a modern-day shooter or a AAA title and you may find enough to saite your appetite.  It will appeal to fans of brainless, easy to beat FPS.  Definitely one of the 'Its so bad, its good!'  One to miss unless you love old-skool beer and pretzel-style shooters or if you are a sucker for punishment!EDIT:- After spending 4hrs trying to get 8 ppl to connect to a single host I can tell you this game has the worst MP facility of any PC game I have ever played and should be avoided at all cost, just for that alone.  I still recommend the game but only for a cheesy SP experience, dont bother thinking about the MP achievements.  They are nigh on impossible to get because you cant even get 4 ppl to consistently connect in a 2v2 game.  Abysmal. "

												Oh boy, this game. This is Bethesda's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ step-child they don't like to talk about. At one point this game was pawned off to Rebellion to finish off and in result we got a buggy mess at launch. Well the price is decent considering the price for admission to a movie cost more and is about the same run time as this game. That's right, the game from start to finish is about 2 hours or less. The bugs have been ironed out although gameplay is still hilarious at times and not in a bad way. What really makes up for this game is the main lead which is voiced by none other then Mickey Rourke. He swears more than a sailor and kicks♥♥♥♥♥like an over the top 80's action hero. The plot even plays like one of those 80's action flicks. There isn't any replay value, once you beat this game it's over. It does contain multiplayer but it's dead unless you find a Steam group for it or friends. Overall it does have it's flaws but the game is rather enjoyable for what it is. 7/10			"

The stuttering was so unbelievable immediately dropping into the game (exactly every 2 seconds) that I couldn't even move around or look without completely freezing up. Utter trash port. All of the ""fixes"" involve disabling the USB HID items in your Device Manager.

												Bethesda markets Rogue Warrior as a “character-driven first person shooter”, which is stretching the definition of character slightly. The game takes place in 1986, where North Koreans and Russians are doing sinister weapons research. This calls for our hero called♥♥♥♥♥♥ who is ready to stop them, armed with an enormous amount of lovely one-liners like “♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥breath commie ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s”. It’s like poetry.This game is only slightly better than the very worst a game can be. The music sounds like it’s from a free music library, but probably isn’t, while the graphics and audio also only meet the quality standard of free template assets. You know you’re in trouble when something as simple as “walking forward” feels bad. To the game’s credit, it only took me 109 minutes to complete. I was in the mood to play something that was total♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it certainly delivered exactly what I was hoping for. If you’re going to make a garbage game, this is the level you should aspire to hit at a minimum. I wasn’t bored by it, and it had the decency to end early. It also didn’t feel like some crap thrown together at random. They tried to make something coherent here, something that resembled a real game. But they didn’t have the means, talent or maybe even the will to make that happen. There’s a reason this game is consistently brought up as a legendary piece of crap 7 years after it came out, while thousands of other bad games are forgotten. It’s hard to put my finger on just what makes this memorable, but it’s the “right” kind of bad to leave an impression, which many mediocre games don’t. Maybe it’s simply the one-liners.			"

Do you feel like turning your brain off and just killing legions of soldiers?Two answers in the affirmative means that this game is for you. Its clunky, not too pretty and lasts a grand total of TWO hours but i had alot of fun for the above reasons.

												This has gotta be one of the worst games I've ever played. Although it has it's charms considering all the profanity it uses. ^^But that's pretty much all it is about, quickkilling enemies with the press of a button and swearing.But it's all so sloppy done by the developers, there's absolutely no finish to this game at all.Mickey Rourke does an okey enough job with his voice-performance since everything else is sub-par it fits pretty well.The guns have no feel to them what so ever. Covermechanics are so basic, it feels like a ten year old game... wait, it IS a ten year old game, say 15 years then. It's nowhere near what Gears of War delivers.The AI is very straight forward. Literally, if you're standing right next to them, they won't see you. Unless your right in front of them. Simple enough to stay out of sight if you wish it.For 2,5€, sure. It's somewhat entertaining in it's own way. You will sure as hell laugh a lot. =)2/10(It get's a 2, because it IS stable, haven't experienced any crashes on my machine, the game has som issues where ragdoll and AI and such can break a bit, but then again what game doesen't have that?)It's still better than Aliens: Colonial Marines ^^			"

In singleplayer you have 8-10 guns(dont remember)-If you will ever buy the game and play it, you will have a free DLC to learn new swears-You have lots of cover if you need it-Cool cut-scenes of Kill Moves and Finishing Moves-The game for me never had any bugs or glitches(that is really good!)CONS-Community is almost dead-For multiplayer achievements you need 4-6 players(they are hard to come by)I rate it 9/10.

												I had to see why this was rated one of the worst games made for 360/ps3 Gen.Whether or not mickey Rourke meant to be funny or maybe he didn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥while recording his lines- like others have said it's hilarious and such a welcome departure from all the me-too military shooters that are so serious and on rails it's not even fun.  But this game is! Granted, I paid around $1.60 from humble store so theres that.  I would have gladly paid $10 though. The campaign is short- like 2.5hrs.   Maybe that's why it was slammed in critic reviews I dont know,  (although I'm gonna browse metacritic after I finish writing this review).  I mean i understand if I paid $60 I'd be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥too.  I remember Homefront was really short but I enjoyed that storyline a lot. It controls fine, looks decent and another reviewer mentioned the music which I agree is really good. This game slowed has full controller support too (some reason it doesn't show up as one,  but it is). The ONLY thing that kinda bugged me was the game stutters a LOT,  (don't worry though,  there's 2 easy fixes out there and it worked like a charm for me.)   After that it runs smooth 60fps.It's silly,  funny,  and doesn't overstay its welcome.  Buy it.			"

												Worth picking up if you like shooters with an old-school feel and overdone action personalities.It is a very short game at 5-6 hours, yet the price is also very low these days.There is nothing epic about this game, there are no boss fights or anything like that.You do covert operations either in stealth or assault, and you fight the same kind of enemies over and over, As far as variation goes you won't get much of that in this game.What stands out the most is the protagonist's overdone dialogues, which is similar to action films from the 80's and 90's, It is cheesy yet very cool at the same time...I mean, its Mickey Rourke.

												Game took me about 3hrs on easy & you could probably go through it all without dying once.Mickey Rourke has that unforgettable voice but personally i didn't get the game just for all the swearing.For a 2009 game it doesn't look bad & i am sure back then it looked respectable.There isn't a whole lot to say about the game & Most ppl got it cause of Mickey Rourke.The same weapons are used pretty much from start to end.Game ran fine for me without stuttering & i had no screen tearing once i set up nvidia's ""manage 3D settings"" to use adaptive Vsync.@ the current regular price it's not bad  & it can be fairly funny watching the AI, physic's & Mickey Rourkes profanity.1 last thing, i don't think i will play this again unless to get more achievements.I would rate it about a 7/10 cause it's not bad but short.

												Imagine that a writer and a composer watched The Rock and were so inspired by Michael Bay's brilliant explosions and Hans Zimmer's catchy riffs that they decided to make a game inspired by that hit 90's movie. Except this time the protagonists are fighting foreign communists instead of domestic terrorists. They nail the superficial aspects of the style while forgetting to include any substance. That's Rogue Warrior.It's a brash, simple, and pointedly racist FPS with little that's notable about it other than the repetitive and profane one-liners voiced by Mickey Rourke. He is by far the best choice possible to pull this off, but how they convinced him to take the job I have no idea. Maybe he didn't see the script ahead of time. Or maybe that's where all the budget went.The strangest thing to me is that the game claims to be ""character-driven"" in its description while actually being the farthest thing from it. There's more character development in an alphabet book.You've only got a couple of tired weapons to choose from and a couple of dumb enemies to fight. So gameplay-wise it's even below par for standard FPS fare. Throw in an awkward cover system that forces you into third-person mode and that's all you need to know about the mechanics.The game is also terribly short. My first playthrough on the highest difficulty was just north of three hours. My second run on normal was just about an hour and a half. And my final go on easy was under an hour. There's just not much to this game in any dimension.And yet...there might be a place for it in your library. A fast, not-challenging run through of an FPS you've never played before can be a fun experience. It can scratch a certain kind of itch. If you've already beaten every Call of Duty and Battlefield there is then there might not be many other places you could look than Rogue Warrior. But it's not fundamentally good. It's just there.

												This game in not interesting, challenging, or clever. However, if you want to run through a few missions killing everyone in sight while Mikey Rourke curses them out to a basic but intese soundtrack this game is for you. I bought it on sale for $2.50 and in a few hours have beat it twice. 7/10 would have Rourke curse out people as I shoot them in the head again.			"

												It ain't horrible, but it aint good either. I'd give it like a 3/10Definitely not worth $10, maybe $2.50Beat the game in two hours on the hardest difficulty so if you're looking for a challenge look elsewhere. This is one of those games that is so bad it's funny. If you can pick it up for 75% off (or, erm, pirate it) I'd say there are worse things you can waste money on.			"

												This game deserves a better Score IMHO, a way better score. Rogue Warrior is a fun, quick shooter game with a foul mouthed soldier that takes place in the mid 80's behind north korean borders. The plan was to meet up with an informant regarding missles being developed and the plan goes sour from the get go. Mickey Rourke is a great voice actor coming up with hilarious foul mouthed sayings, that will keep you laughing for a while.  I read and saw some videos of people experiencing glitches and problems, but I had none of them tbh. Game runs well and plays well. Took me around 2 hours to beat this game, that is how short it truly is, but don't let that deter you from buying the game, its one hell of a good time.			"

												Im going to start by saying i got suprised by the lack of quality of this game published by bethesda, with their high quality standard, this game feel very misplaced at their list of published games.If you are looking for serious shooter like Battlefield, call of duty, crysis or the Fallout series released also by them, you will have a big disappoint, Rogue Warrior is no where near any of them, even the cod series with their dated engine provide a more realistic enviorement and believable world.The weapons are weak and feel unsatisfying to shoot with them, the textures are awfull most of the time and some are misplaced, dumb animations, especially the finishing moves, wich make the game hilarious at some point, the AI is unbelivable with their dumb actions and speech and very weak voice acting.The story is dumb, confusing and when he try the humor to catch the player, most of the time is ridiculous, even the sarcastic moments feel empty and dumbed.Rogue Warrior still have some fun moments, if you get this on sale can be enjoyable to see all this weak points come together, its hilarious and for that, i only recommend this game to the die hard players that play anything for fun, and for fun ONLY.

When I played it though I loved it lol especially hearing the♥♥♥♥♥♥that comes out of♥♥♥♥♥♥s mouth. Even though this game isn't great the price tag is for nostalgia. I always use the AK-74 and I just laugh at the fact the AK-74 looks exactly like an AK-47. I'm only using one USB port for my wireless mouse and I'm not suffering from this stuttering bug.. I guess I'm lucky. If your on the fence about buying this game just buy it and play it for a bit and if you don't like it refund it. You can also probably beat this game in under two hours and refund it also :)			"

												BETTER BE DEAD THAN RED - that's just one of priceless cheezy one liners that can get imprinted in your brain after playing this game !!!Another B grade production, slightly dated (2009) but most people dubbed it one of the worst games ever.  Honestly people, got no ♥♥♥♥in idea why.  It is cheezy, extremely fun to play and although both graphics and gameplay itself are slightly dated I had more fun here than in COD Ghosts campaign...If you can pick it up on sale or bundle DO IT, otherwie - IT IS GOOD BYE FREE WORLD!Another thing: one of BEST soundtracks !!!Have I mentioned Mickey Rourke? I mean FUUUCK can it get any more cool than this:

The game is good but don't spend full price for it. Get it on ebay for 5 bucks and put the cd key into your steam account to save you money. Its language is really harsh and vulgar. The F word is dropped on every kill almost. Its a game to burn some time with. It doesn't take long to beat at all too. Worth The 5 bucks if you find it at that price!			"

												I played this game and got a refund for it...And im usually open about games. This game is in no way a stealth game even though they say ""Stealth is always a good option"" and the enemies have a 6th sense saying ""Hm i feel a pressence. Must sound alarm!"" making stealth completely useless. This game has very little good story telling other then Russians are the bad guys, go mess them up. They give the main character a flat personality even though they try to make him sound like the funny bond guy mixed with a bad mouthed sailor. The gameplay is so straight forward as i said stealth isnt even needed in missions. Any mission you get caught even if you didnt get caught in the first place. For example. A mission has you infiltrate a building. You infiltrate and i did this stealthy, not raising an alarm. Then half way through i get a bunch of enemies and alarms saying ""Intruder!"" So i blast through a massive wave of guys to the end. Next mission, same thing. Next mission? SAME THING. I dont reccomend this game because its just a shooter. Not a stealth game.			"

												One of the worst games I have played in a long time. It is only 2 hours long, which actually I could say as bad as it is, this is a positive thing. It is extremely generic, and reminds me strongly of a few other games I can think of that are just like it: Damnation, Dark Sector, and Velvet Assassin. Those are all third person games, but they are all very similar in genericness. Unlike those games though this one at least has one redeeming factor, its voice acting. Mickey Rourke's lines are all hilarious, but since you can probably find all of it on Youtube, there is no reason to bother with this game even if it was free. The slow jam song at the end with Rourke's lines all edited together to rhyme was pretty funny though.Graphics look like 2005, not 2009, ai is really bad, and weapons firing sounds like kids toys. The music is extremely generic, the levels are 100% linear, and are void of any possible interaction besides hit E to open a door or plant a bomb. The stealth is as basic as it can possibly get. Crouch down and hit E to stealth kill, or just sprint to an enemy and do it. Most of the time it only lets you stealth kill a few guys then the rest of the level is designed to be bad generic gunplay.Really bad game but still better than a lot of other similar generic games like the ones I mentioned. It would be worth buying over those games if it wasn't only 2 hours long, but is still only barely a 4/10 game either way.			"

												★½ out of four.Unfortunately, it is actually technical problems that most notably hinder this game. Completing it in three hours and two sittings, my technical experience was different both times.It seems stuttering may be a problem for some configurations; I never experienced this. The first sitting the game would occasionally freeze or freeze and show my desktop and then flicker back to the game. This got very frequent and bothersome after a time. The second sitting only had this a few times, but now there was consistent screen tearing. However, the tearing was not an egregious variety -- smooth and fleeting for what it was. It seems prospective players are taking a gamble on how the game will actually run for them.FOV seems non-adjustable, but it was managable. Another massive problem was aim-down-sights on probably a bit over half of the guns is broken such that the point the bullets actually hit is down into the model of the gun itself.If you need to do some♥♥♥♥♥♥shooter, this can be cheaper and leaner than alternatives. There are no collectables, so one can enjoy going through the linear game-path. Story gets a touch less coherent at the end. There is swearing, but I would have preferred more or more additional variations at least. There are a few tracks, so sometimes you're left in the quiet, but at least the tracks have a beat to them. The broadly noted Credits track is great and a great reward, but you can always select it directly from the main menu if you must. Difficulty achievements don't stack, so I'd run on Normal and watch for standing near explosives.			"

The game is also extremely short so do not even think about buying this game for any larger amount of money. With that said i had some fun with it and you will probably too as long as you keep your expectations to the minimum. THe game had some severe screen tearing problems by the way.			"

												Review of Rogue Warrior:Brief History: Rogue warriow is based off a novel (or novel series) about Richard ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Marcinco, a US Navy SEAL. The books, including an autobiography, and several spinoff fiction books. The autobiography calls him a ""death defying"" soldier, who was in the United States's SEAL Team Six, an incredibly impressive feat.Game Summary: In this game, you control a profanity-spewing♥♥♥♥♥♥(as the game wants him to be called) Marcinko, murder hordes of communists in hilarious and over-the-top ways. You have to blow a lot of stuff up, including submarines and missles (yes, that is the entire plot). This game takes itself too seriously (like most modern shooters, Battlefield and Call of Duty to name a few), and seems like it tries too hard to earn it's M rating. Many times per mission, Marcinko spouts profanity; including every couple of hallways, every time he is hit, or just every like he says in general. The takedown cutscenes try to be brutal, but fail. The game has glitches, such as all enemies knowing where you are and enemies being able to shoot through cover, and all glitches work against you. There is one glitch where, sometimes, your guns will have no recoil while in cover, but that was all I could find. This game is incredibly short, with two hours of main campaign time. This game has lots of achievments, but sadly you cannot get them all due to some needing multiplayer (which no one plays). This game is actually tremendously funny, mostly because of lines like, ""The wind was so cold, it could freeze the balls off a f**king polar bear"" and ""F**k! F**k you, you f**king ametuer peices of s**t"" and most of all, ""Suck my balls, my giant, hairy, big f**king balls, wrap 'em around your neck you c**k-sucking motherf**kers!""I apologize for that.Upsides:This game is one of the funniest you will play in a long time.Marcinko's dialouge keeps the ""flow of gameplay"" consistant.This game has a good soundtrack.The game is surprisingly fun.Average shooter.Stealth kind of works a bit.Has a cover system that would be fantastic if improved on.Good mix of FPS and TPS (First Person and Third Person)Has the best end credits theme of all time, no joke.Downsides:Game is incredibly glitchy.Game has ways of killing you out of nowhere.Some of Marcinko's lines make you cringe. (Such as, ""Fondle my hairy nuts"")Game is WAY too short, it feels like a Call of duty: Modern Warfare DLC.Cover system breaks a bit.Random difficulty spikes. (One minute you kill twenty enemies, no problem. Then one guy pins/kills you a bunch)Difficulty levels have almost no difference.Game takes itself too seriously.Multiplayer mode.Nobody plays multiplayer mode.Most guns feel the same.No jumping.No melee attack, you get a cutscene.Cutscenes usually make no sense.Reload animation doesn't match up with actual reload.OVERALL:3/10 (Very bad)Last comments:This is one of those games that is so bad, it's good. It is a bad game, but it makes for two-three hours of intense laughter. I reccomend this game to those who want a more casual shooter that supplies fun in short bursts.Price Tag: $10.00What it is Worth: $3.00What I Paid: $5.00What I Would Pay: $5.00 "

												Hasty attempt at making a few quick bucks off of Richard Marcinko's fame.You walk along. You stab a guy. You walk along. You shoot a guy. Rinse and repeat as necessary.Low on health? Do a close combat kill move and you'll be invulnerable until the move is finished, while all the other guys are unloading rounds on you, then do the same to the next guy. If you're in a room with 5 or 6 bad guys, it's an easy way of clearing out a room.You do this for a while before realizing that that's about all there is to the game.			"

												I played this game and got a refund for it...And im usually open about games. This game is in no way a stealth game even though they say ""Stealth is always a good option"" and the enemies have a 6th sense saying ""Hm i feel a pressence. Must sound alarm!"" making stealth completely useless. This game has very little good story telling other then Russians are the bad guys, go mess them up. They give the main character a flat personality even though they try to make him sound like the funny bond guy mixed with a bad mouthed sailor. The gameplay is so straight forward as i said stealth isnt even needed in missions. Any mission you get caught even if you didnt get caught in the first place. For example. A mission has you infiltrate a building. You infiltrate and i did this stealthy, not raising an alarm. Then half way through i get a bunch of enemies and alarms saying ""Intruder!"" So i blast through a massive wave of guys to the end. Next mission, same thing. Next mission? SAME THING. I dont reccomend this game because its just a shooter. Not a stealth game.			"

												This game was painful.  Runs horribly and has screen tearing on my PC which only makes this game worse.  Couple this with generic gunplay and the worst AI ever you have created one of the generic FPSes ever.  The only thing this game has is Mickey Rourke cursing because the developers couldn't come up with anything better to have him say.  This game isn't good as a ""so bad it's good"" game it's far too painful to ever be called this.  Please I know it's $2.49 when it goes on sale but it's not worth it.  Don't torture yourself.  If you really want to see this game look up some guy let's playing it.  Please don't do it to yourself there are far better games on steam that are worth playing.			"

												rogue warrior isn't a game. rogue warrior is about richard ""demo♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; marcinko's foray into a miserable post-life hell. the only way he can function as a human being is to be commissioned by game dev studios to yell ""BOOM-TIME"" or ""ARRGHHH ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S"" into a studio microphone, jacking himself off on his testosterone-filled accomplishments while basking in his prideful mediocrity. this game is the ultimate realization of this.but you detest this with: 'cleary this is an fps computer game! i'm a gamer.'no, this isn't a game.this is an extension of marcinko's inflated ego that only serves to fumble around on a slippery public bathroom floor. you get to experience his life as a boring piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥that can only reliably exist in a dystopian ""AUGGGGHH KILL A GOOK COMMIE FOR MOMMY WHITE PRIDE"" cold war ♥♥♥♥pile.buy this if you hate yourself.

												This is an awful shooter.  Graphics are straight out of a 2000 style shooter - think of it as being along the lines of the Original Soldier of Fortune.  If this had been a 2000 title, much of it could be forgiven, but it was released in 2009.  Weapons and Grenades are awful.  Trying to use the melee system is awful as the game must stop to show a cut scene - too late if the guy cries out to alert his friends.  Exploding barrels are everywhere to shoot at, ammo for your starting weapons is almost non-existant meaning you will be swapping out weapons.  You have two weapons slots so choose your weapons carefully.  No, nevermind, just take the guns you can get ammo for.Some weapons just seem to randomly show up.  Meh!Don't spend more than $5.  It has some good ideas that are cliche, but this game coming out in 2009 and already being dated - pass it up.Mickey Rourke's voice acting is just about the only saving grace this game has.  If you've read all of Marcinkos Rogue Warrior books, then you'll already be familiar with the cursing.  An no, Marcinko's real voice does not sound like Mickey Rourke.			"

												This is really not a very good FPS game. The level design is poor, the story is absurd, and the main character uses four letter words at the rate of one every two seconds. The main character comes across as so disagreeable you find yourself running him into a fire fight just to get him killed. Not a good way to make the player associate with their game character.The level design is bad and the graphics are poor for even 2009. The enemy AI is brain-dead. Perhaps the strangest game play element is the stealth move. You can sneak up on an opponent and use the stelth move to kill them. However, you can also (if you run fast enough) rush an enemy firing their weapon in your face, use the stelth move, and kill them with a knife. I have gone through entire levels just rushing enemies with my knife and never firing a shot. Apparently, when running in stealth mode  you are immune from bullet damage.Playing more than ten minutes of this game (and you can ""beat"" the game in less than two hours), requires a strong stomach. The only bright spot is that I can use this game in my Game Design class as a bad example of how not to do an FPS game. "

												Wow. Just wow. This game ought to serve as a crash course on how not to design and execute a game. A literal crash course because I beat it in less than two hours. I would've beaten it faster if I didn't die because of so much random♥♥♥♥♥♥exploding all over the place.Let me go over all the key points that every game developer should take note of in this game, and look not to do:- It took me less than two hours to beat it. Seriously. - There was no option to adjust resolution or lighting quality. In fact, there's exactly four options on the video menu.- Thank god they allowed me to turn off the motion blur, because it's so ♥♥♥♥ing intense that it makes me nauseous just thinking about it, and I'm usually a fan of motion blur in games.- There's no vsync whatsoever, and the game has screen tears like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- The lighting quality is so inconsistent that it makes my head hurt. Some areas are completely unlit and others are really well lit.- The fire effects look pretty similar to a 90's FPS. They look atrocious.- There's grenade indicators in this game, but you're the only person that can throw grenades (WTF)- There's no subtitles. Which as I point out later, is both a good thing and a bad thing.- There's no other option besides English to play this game in.- Let's talk about controls...for starters, you can't even access half the controls without using a controller, as the scroll menu can't be scrolled down using either the mouse or the keyboard..you'll need a controller to even do that.- During the game, I was told to ""pull back on the left stick in order to move away from cover"" when I was using mouse and keyboard.- The horizontal and vertical sensitivity for the mouse aren't consistent. The vertical sensitivity is about half as sensitive as the horizontal sensitivity, if not less.- The horizontal and forward/backward movement isn't consistent either. Once again, you move almost 2x as fast when moving sideways or backwards (?!) than you do moving forwards. Wat.- Iron sights are bound to the space bar by default, and the grenade key is bound to the right mouse button. Did anyone bother to play this game on PC? Seriously..- There's only two weapons in the game, yet there's three different binds to switch weapons, all of which do the same thing. The hell?- Speaking of weapons, there's a grand total of 8 of them in the actual game, and NPCs only ever use and drop 3 of them. Every weapon is obtainable in every mission.- There's a huge amount of ammo in the game, so don't worry about running out of it.- Can one-hit-kill everything by walking up to it and pressing F.- NPCs are completely bugged, their AI is totally ♥♥♥♥ed up beyond belief.- Voice acting quality is legitimately terrible, everyone sounds like they're talking through a cardboard tube. I had to turn voice volume all the way up because I couldn't hear a damn thing that anyone was saying.- Lip sync is really really off- The volume and sensitivity options are annoying to use. Instead of being like circles or vertical bars, they're slanted boxes which makes it easy to confuse two options as being the same thing. However, if you count the number of bars filled/empty, you'll quickly realize that this isn't they aren't the same at all.- The main character is ♥♥♥♥ing irritating with all his god damn mother♥♥♥♥ing swearing about stupid ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because he's a ♥♥♥♥ing American, bro, and that's how ♥♥♥♥ing Americans ought to speak, you ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I had one hell of a ♥♥♥♥ing time shooting at fire extinguishers and having the main character ♥♥♥♥ing yell ""YOU MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING COMMIE SON OF A ♥♥♥♥♥"". Who do those ♥♥♥♥ing Red fire extinguishers think they are?- No buildup at all to the last mission, just feels like you're doing yet another mission. THE END.- There's three types of enemies in this game: Asian Commies, Russian Commies, and Russian Commies wearing helmets- Each mission: kill a few guys stealthily, suddenly you can't kill everyone stealthily so you have to go loud, and then you plant bombs on things and win. That's every single mission in a nutshell.- In the opening segment of the game, the player character rants about his team being complete badasses/hardasses. After the next loading screen, they all die in the stupidest way possible.- There's only one or two music tracks used in the entire game. You will quickly get irritated by listening to it.- There's so much random♥♥♥♥♥♥that blows up, you'll never have any clue how you actually die. There will usually be an explosion offscreen and then ""DED.""- There's no health or damage indicators, only a very very minor change in screen color when you're about to die. You'll have to squint often to see how much health you have.Seriously. Nobody wanted this game, nobody asked for this game, and I can't imagine what the hell was going on at Rebellion when this game was being made. Did people just smoke a joint, play Duke Nukem and say ""yeah, let's do this!"" That's seriously what it looks like.PS: Bethesda, stop shoveling♥♥♥♥♥♥games like these into Quakecon bundles. Thanks.

												While a bit short, this older game seems mostly bug free, has amusing (though Adult) commentary by Mickey Rourke, a few weapons, and whole lot of corpses.   Was it worth the $1.64us I paid?  Oh hell yes.  Was it a modern AAA title? Of course not, it's 7 years old already and gave me plenty of chuckles as I charged on through.   On the normal difficulty I found it quite forgiving and died more from blowing myself up, or hiding behind weapons crates that catch fire (you won't see the flames in 1st person unless you use the Cover key) and explode than from enemy fire.No bosses, just a few rather busy segments. -The silenced pistol is garbage.  Even at Kill Range a single head shot will NOT kill an enemy. Dump it for something useful. "

												Rogue warrior perhaps is the worst game publish by Bethesda. The graphc is kind of outdated for a 2009 game. Well, it is developed by Rebellion, I would not expect too much.For a decounted price, the game however worth it. It is not as bad as people said here. And yet, the game is more like running to the enemy and press E.The game is trying to be a kind of stealth game, but it kind of fail. It has potential though.			"

												Not as bad as everyone makes out to be, it’s not a 5-star game by no stretch but to sit back and laugh at all the pointless profanity and aggression is a good time. Shooting feels ok and cover it snappy. If it’s on sale and you're in a silly mood go for it, Micky Rourke hates communism.			"

												Imagine if Goldeneye had been made in 2002 for the PS2. That's Rogue Warrior. Don't knock it. A dumb shooter game with a few stealth elements tacked on. Enjoy it for what it is, and don't compare it to what it's not. You'd be amazed how much fun it is to have a game that doesn't even pretend to be clever. You shoot at the bad mans, the bad mans fall over, your character says tough guy things. A nice reminder that a game doesn't have to have to try to be more than a dumb shooter to be fun.			"

												First the bad:Short linear story, dumb ai, more cursing than i have ever heard anywhere... ever.Now the good:You don't have to think about anything or manage any inventory. It's just you and lots of dumb bad guys. Shoot them, blow them up, or just sneak(run) up on them and press a button to stab them in the face.The bottom line:It's actually alot of fun just killing everything that moves while Mickey Rourke shouts random obsene insults at them. For $5 it's totally worth it.			"

												Pros:- Hilarious voice acting by Mickey Rourke. - The kill moves are so funny and exaggerated that they make me laugh every time I see them.- Awesome one liners : the 3 lines I like the most are ''Suck my balls, my hairy fuc-king big balls and wrap'em around your fuc-king neck'', ''God damn coc-k breath commie mother-fuc-kers !!!'' and ''DIE MOTHER-FUC-KERS FU-CK'' (my favorite, which makes me laugh my @$$ off)- Enemies act like total idiots.- The rocket scientists who made this game proved with great accuracy that ''E'' is one of the most used letters in the latin alphabet (see point #2)- Has the mentality of a 1980s action comedy flick.- The rap song at the end of the game is great and worthy to be listen.- If you want to laugh and have a good time, just play this game alone or for the best, with friends.- Has less bugs than major modern PC games (see Batman: Arkham knight for example)- Game should be given to science to help fight Tourette's syndrome.- Protagonist looks like an awkward and comical combination of Steven Seagal and Chuck Norris (ponytail and beard)- Pistol has infinite ammo and is very good for headshots; unfortunately you need to reload it. It's also the best weapon in the whole fuc-king game.- You can offer this game as a gift to all the people you hate.- If Rogue warrior was a movie, it would be a lot worse than The shawshank redemption but A LOT BETTER than the 2015 Fantastic Four film.Cons:- Game is too short and not worth the price; should be less than 5 $- Choice of weapons is limited.- Plot is incoherent, while missions are ridiculously too simple.- Trailer looks better.- Can cause many symptoms to people who won't like the game...- Can mess your life.- You may need a bottle of Pepto-Bismol to ease possible stomaches (may be caused by laughing or by disgust)- I don't understand people who complained about the graphics. If they want to play a bad game with ugly graphics, they should try E.T. the extraterrestrial for Atari.			"

												This is an awful shooter.  Graphics are straight out of a 2000 style shooter - think of it as being along the lines of the Original Soldier of Fortune.  If this had been a 2000 title, much of it could be forgiven, but it was released in 2009.  Weapons and Grenades are awful.  Trying to use the melee system is awful as the game must stop to show a cut scene - too late if the guy cries out to alert his friends.  Exploding barrels are everywhere to shoot at, ammo for your starting weapons is almost non-existant meaning you will be swapping out weapons.  You have two weapons slots so choose your weapons carefully.  No, nevermind, just take the guns you can get ammo for.Some weapons just seem to randomly show up.  Meh!Don't spend more than $5.  It has some good ideas that are cliche, but this game coming out in 2009 and already being dated - pass it up.Mickey Rourke's voice acting is just about the only saving grace this game has.  If you've read all of Marcinkos Rogue Warrior books, then you'll already be familiar with the cursing.  An no, Marcinko's real voice does not sound like Mickey Rourke.			"

												This is really not a very good FPS game. The level design is poor, the story is absurd, and the main character uses four letter words at the rate of one every two seconds. The main character comes across as so disagreeable you find yourself running him into a fire fight just to get him killed. Not a good way to make the player associate with their game character.The level design is bad and the graphics are poor for even 2009. The enemy AI is brain-dead. Perhaps the strangest game play element is the stealth move. You can sneak up on an opponent and use the stelth move to kill them. However, you can also (if you run fast enough) rush an enemy firing their weapon in your face, use the stelth move, and kill them with a knife. I have gone through entire levels just rushing enemies with my knife and never firing a shot. Apparently, when running in stealth mode  you are immune from bullet damage.Playing more than ten minutes of this game (and you can ""beat"" the game in less than two hours), requires a strong stomach. The only bright spot is that I can use this game in my Game Design class as a bad example of how not to do an FPS game. "
