												Forgotten Sands is one of the best games in the Prince of Persia series, very underrated. The acrobatic platforming is amazing, mixing up powers like freezing water, making parts of the ruins reappear and rewinding time, some sequences are hard and may require flawless timing. Sadly, the story is not the best with some average combat but I do recommend this game. "

												If you're a fan of the Sands of Time or Warrior Within then this game is a mustn't have!The game takes you back seamlessly to the Princes brother's kingdom in Azad (Did you know he had a brother? I didn't know he had a brother!) where you go through the necessary tutorials to understand just how awful the controls in this game are. The basic controls are all there; jump, roll, strike, run up walls... block isn't one of them, because apparently it isn't useful when you're fighting several dozen enemies at once, with an arrogant sword combo so slow it gives you an extra half second every strike just to appreciate how much you hate the game. Oh and it's just the one weapon, no several weapons, no stealing them from monsters, or using them to throw at enemies, or infact throwing enemies at other enemies (Come on, we all did it), no instead the Prince relies on a much more effective stategy of kicking them. Yep kicking them, oh and apparently all that awesome jumpy acrobatic mid air strikes stuff just wasn't cool enough to continue. Then again this is probably for the best as Prince has difficulty moving correctly because the controls are so poorly calibrated (or at least different from the previous 3 games) made worse by the AWFUL automatic camera showing you various angles of walls and the Prince's♥♥♥♥♥♥instead of useful stuff like obsticles or enemies. Merits: Good Story, good boss characters, some new obstaclesPitfalls: Everything else.I got this game on sale and I still feel ripped off. This is the kind of game that makes you want to slap the whole of Ubisoft in the face.			"

												The polar opposite of Prince of Persia (2008), instead of fighting one enemy at a time, you fight hordes upon hordes of enemies, you have your time powers back, its not cel-shaded, and you don't have some lady sidekick following you around. I don't need an escort for my parkour mistakes, I HAVE RECALL FOR THAT!Apparently the Prince has been working on some new parkour techniques after SoT, but then forgot them in WW, (guess thats why its called Forgotten Sands) because in this game, you can infinitely wall jump, which now wall runs a bit, and then wall jump again, rinse and repeat, you get the point. Also, he must of got some beauty sleep because he looks pretty suave, and then in WW, he must of took an ugly dirt nap or something, cause in WW he looks worse than he did in SoT.This game has a pretty cool new mechanic in which you can make water solid for a short period of time, such as waterfalls, and jets of water, to make walls to wallrun and jump across, and to make poles of solid water to swing on respectively.And um... other things.... I assume theres other powers and whatnot, but honestly this is somehow the LEAST memorable PoP game. Probably because I only played through it once, then again I only played through PoP 2008 once, and I remember way more in that than I do this, mainly cause them cel-shaded environments, lack of time powers (yeah, it probably♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off enough to make me remember it more), and overly dramatic one on one battles, and its wacko ending.Also, theres a giant boss at the end where you're on a really sketchy platform in the sand, HAVE FUN!

												This Prince of Persia 1.5 (or a pre-sequel between 'Sands of Time' and 'Warrior Within') plays like a breeze and lets you do all you ever wanted with the Prince (vertical wall runs, rock climbing and special powers like invulnerability and area of effect ice and fire magic, etc...). Sure it's not as expansive or hard as the sequels and the combat system is rather inferior but the game is better and longer than I expected, with 2 new ingenious game mechanics involving freezing water and recalling ancient structures one by one whille you jump through waterfalls and disappearing pillars...And you can actually play as Ezio from Assassin's Creed 2, now that's fan service!

												WAIT TO SEE WHAT I HAVE TO SAYI'm a fan of PoP, warrior within being my favorite, if you already played a PoP game you'll understand easily what I want to sayIf you're only going to play for the platform part of jumping and running on walls, go ahead and give that game a try ! The platform part was great, you can freeze the water (freeze time for the water) which opens a totally new door for platforming. Sometime you have to freeze a fall to run on it, jump, unfreeze water to pass through a second fall and freeze it again to grab a column of water. It was really great, I had a nice timeHOWEVER, the reason why I don't recommend it is the fighting part... I was so much very a lot deceive by it. (mark my words)... In Warrior Within you had many combos, you could jump on the wall onto the ennemies, grab them break their neck and steal their weapon... great time ! The Forgotten Sands is freaking lame, you have to attack buttons, weak attack, or a stronger version of that attack, NO COMBO, NO VARIETY, NO FUN... So sad, the fighting part was no complete and incredibly dull...the fighting makes the game a bad game, but if you're willing to go over it and only play for the platforming, go ahead !			"

												It is a good game. The puzzle platforms are great, the cenarios are beatiful remembering the ones from The Two Thrones, the songs are forgetable, the story is ok and the battle system is lame, but at least there aren't many fights and they are over really quick. Let's talk about the powers. You can rewind time like on the other Prince of Persia games and now you can level up the prince and use four new spells. You can leave a trail of fire, create an impenetrable armor of sand, send forth shards of ice with each attack and release winds to push enemies back. Besides that there is a genie that will give you the hability to freeze water, materialize structures that were destroyed and jump long distances over an enemy target, which are all used for the puzzle platforms. There aren't many types of enemies and they are all super easy to kill, there is no challenge at all at killing things. There is no fancy move list, you start with the same lame slash attacks, a jump attack, a kick and with them you'll end the game. They send lots of enemies at once making it fell like you are stomping ants, but at least it is not as bad as the battle system from the PoP 2008 which also had an awful platform system. Summarizing, battle bad, but berable and platform good as it should be in a PoP game.			"

												Highly underrated game. Its acrobatic platforming is smoother, better balanced and with a greater sense of flow and action than all of the previous games. It may not have the same charm and the rich story and character interactions of Sands of Time, but for my money its gameplay alone makes it one of the best of the franchise. I suspect the reason people were so critical of this game was simply because it was released as a tie-in to the disappointing movie.			"

												Very underrated game that was ignored by many due to DRM that has since been toned down. If you liked Sands of Time this is an extension of that, only with better combat, better PC controls and of course better visuals. The platforming and combat just feel smooth from start to finish, making it a joy to play and complete.			"

												The Forgotten Sands is nothing like the PoP-Trilogy, even though it is set after ""Sands of Time"". The game is ignoring everything the previous games did right and it feels like a generic game for the stupid mass. -) The Prince's movements are not smooth, they are rough and not fitting.-) I know most of his movements are impossible in real life, but jumping against a wall, pausing and THEN start to run up the wall? COME ON!-) What happened to the fighting system? There are no combos, no special time abilities, nothing! The only thing you have to to is smashing X and and once in a while all the other buttons. WTH Ubisoft?-) The story is lame, average sequel story-crap, predictable and plain stupid. -) Sometimes the Prince is making a funny comment, but if you expect witty comments or dialogs like in ""Two Thrones"" , you'll be greatly disappointed.All in All: If you liked or loved the original Prince of Persia Trilogy, DONT BUY ""Forgotten Sands"", it's a waste of time and money. Hopefully, Ubisoft will find a way back to their former quality...			"

												One of the most beautiful and spectacular games I've ever played. An interactive fairy tale, a challenge for your fingers, a treat for your eyes, and a few thoughts for your mind as well. If you're tired of ugly, mean, violent and criminal games - this one will feel like a vacation. Fights are fun, not too difficult, as it is not the most important part of the gameplay. The character movements are realistic, voice acting is very good, the story is solid. As a fan of the original Prince Of Persia game from 1990, I was impressed by how close the gameplay follows the original concept.			"

												To all the naysayers: This game does not deserve it's ""mixed"" rating. It's a great game and it's even a good PoP game. I literally can't find much fault here. The game is unpatched (v 1.00) yet I've encountered not a single bug. The prince moves and fights smoothly and responds well to commands. I've only encountered a handful of times in which I wanted to do something that he did not (usually that's wall jump instead of wall run or vice versa, which has always been a problem). There's everything here that makes an interesting game: good platforming, interesting mechanics, devious traps and relatively diverse combat, though this is still the weakest part of the game (but thankfully after having played Sands of Time right before this one it's nowhere near as bad and actually quite enjoyable). People complain that there is no block button...you don't need it in this game. Simple as that.The platforming is extremely smooth and there are enough mechanics introduced throughout the game (about 8 hours in total) that it won't get boring. You have a few boss fights, mini bosses, etc. The story is actually rather interesting as well, though here is my one and only real gripe with the game...it's a pre-sequel. It's PoP 1.5 instead of PoP 4 for example or just an entirely new game. It interjects the overall story arch with something that wasn't necessary in my opinion and since it's about 8-13 years newer than the rest of the games it takes you out of the immersion (it's weird going from 2003 to 2010 and then back to 2004 and 2005). Apart from that I can only recommend this one. It looks good, plays seemlessly and has an interesting story.			"

												The only Prince of Persia game I have ever played (beside the classic side scrollers in the early '90s). From what I understand there is a trilogy of PoP games and Forgotten Sands is what one should call an interquel, an episode that portrays the events in between those that were explained in two other PoP games.The story follows the prince who tries to help his brother, Malik. Malik was a bad boy and unleashed an army of sand creatures so it is now up to the prince to save the world from Solomon's Army. Story-wise, it offers nothing special, but I liked the struggle between the two brothers - there is a certain tension there that makes you want to proceed and find out how it'll end.When this game came out, Ubisoft was in deep development of the 2nd or 3rd Assassins Creed game. You can only imagine how fluid the climbing in this game, right? Some of these climbing sequences are actually a bit over the top - the prince can later on solidify water to use them as columns or can rebuild the environment if it's in ruins (only for a short period of time, though). Some powers can be used against the enemies, as well, and while fighting you gain experience points and eventually, you level up. This is just a minor RPG component here as PoP is essentially an action-adventure game far from true RPGs.Forgotten Sands has a very high production value that all Ubisoft games can be associated with. It's a relatively long adventure that all gamers should participate in. If you have never heard of the Prince of Persia franchise, you might pick this one up for starters.			"

												Sigh. Where to start with this.Uplay problemsSo, I got the game, downloaded it, Uplay got installed. Couldn't create an account. Downloaded the latest version and launched the game. Right here, all of this is an insult to the players. Pirates will still pirate, all of this is useless.After that, I found out that there are ""awards"" for the game which unlocks additional content for you. Pretty sweet, eh? No. I made progress in game, earned Uplay points, went on the website and unlocked every single award, then I just needed to open Uplay from the game's main menu. But boom, the Uplay browser crashes. Every single time, and I haven't found a proper fix for it.The GameThe game sucks in many ways. ""But it's freaking Prince of Persia dude! It's a must-have for me, right?!"" that's what I thought before buying this game as well. Trust me, you will be disappointed.Ubisoft forgot how their game actually was. In the trilogy, the Prince was the serious type and in the 2008 reboot, he was humorous. This game was meant to be more like the trilogy, yet he's far away from the Prince we know. The plot is pretty light and boring. Some dialogues make you cringe. The music is pretty forgettable, just like the game itself. Nothing like the mysterious OST of Sands of Time and the reboot or the epic Warrior Within. Gameplay is really, really repetitive. You mostly do the same thing you do in every other level. The combat is extremely easy compared to the trilogy, you can almost blow the sand creatures up. All of the boss fights require the same, simple technique except for the last one.  But graphics. Who cares about that? Yeah, it's fairly improved, but it won't cover the actual content up.Overall, I'd say forget about it. Thanks for taking time and reading this.			"

												Let me make myself clear: Prince of Persia: Forgotten Sands is an extremely fun game. It follows the classic formula of the other Prince of Persia games: perform high intensity acrobatics with simplistic combat mechanics and death defying puzzles. But Forgotten Sands executes this formula so well that I want to almost say it is better than Sands of Time. Almost.It’s a high quality game and you really should play through it if you are remotely interested. The mostly challenging campaign lasts about 6-9 hours packed with AMAZING graphics. The story, while mostly original, is intriguing until you get your first super power (from there on out, it’s pretty bland).That said, PoP: FS is very repetitive with the combinations of traps (you will see atleast ONE saw-blade down every hallway) .To read more from this review: http://gamespotting.net/gameblog/review-prince-of-persia-the-forgotten-sands/Verdict: BUY IF ON SALE			"

The story is boring, the combat is simply mashing one mouse button over and over, and there is very little variety whatsoever in the monsters. I hope this is the final nail in the rotting tomb that is the Prince of Persia franchise. It's just gotten worse ever since the Sands of Time trilogy. This addition is quite frankly, an insult.I forgot to mention more bad things. It's a terrible console-port. Controls are horrible, the graphics don't support V-Sync which caused alot of stuttering, and the camera is god awful. And they ruined the Prince's facial features. They couldn't even get that right.

												From the Prince of Persia franchise, this is one of the best.The combat part is not ""I-give-up-playing-this"" hard but it's not ""now-with-only-one-hand"" easy. Sometimes there is a lot (and with lot I mean it!) of not too strong enemies, and sometimes there is two or three strong beasts and a bunch of smaller enemies to give them emotional support.The typical PoP parkour is awesome in this game, since you can't just go back in time, but freeze water too, sometimes you need a perfect domain of your hands to do some serious multitasking, specially in the end of the game where there is a stage called ""The Final Climb"", because if you clim that, you can climb everything else.The only not-that-good part of the game is the story, it's a little crude.

												This game is look like a reboot. If you play the old ones like warrior within or the two thrones, you will notice the differences.The combat system now only allowed the prince to use one sword and kick. Not like the old one that can use two swords or swords with hammer like dual wielding, (duh). Just can attack the enemies, not grabbing and execute it like the old ones.Also this game has upgrade system by killing the enemy, not like the old ones that we should explore to find it.Anyway, this is a pretty solid game and actually kinda funny because sometimes the prince will talk to himself, wondering, that show another side of prince we know as a human.When you get the new sword, a little bit funny thing is the sword will talk if you swing itP.S. : get deluxe version, so you will get free sands of time to nostalgic the glorious old one series of Prince of Persia			"

												Personally loved it!Comparison with the sands of time trilogy is unavoidable, so let's see:-Story and characters are okay, alas not at the same level as previous games. Let's just say they keep the narrative going for the game, but they are not going to be a shining beacon in the videogame world. Trap comedy never gets old for Ubisoft.-Platforming - absolutely the greatest achievement of the game. It keeps the Sands of Time trilogy basic format, adding here and there some of the features we'd seen in the reboot, plus all-new mechanics which make it so much deeper, and in my opinion better than any of the old ones. It even makes up for the need for uPlay....Ah, yes, of course, there's uPlay... *sigh*-Combat is the hard one. So... love it or hate it, I guess. The fighting system is completely different than before: it's not anymore as acrobatic and varied combo-wise as the old trilogy, but hey, if you're into cleaving through a swarm of enemies with large swipes and the occasional roll-out-of-trouble, this might suit you well. I'm personally pretty ok with the chosen style. If you played the others for the combat though, this may not be the game for you. The powers one can acquire, always in my opinion, all in all are fun and useful, probably more than the sand powers we were used to. Fights get a bit dull, as per usual, at the end with the acquisition of the ever-present ""water-sword-of-the-day"". "

												The only Prince of Persia game I have played more than 5-7 times. I know it doesn't seem that way, but that's because I first owned it on XBOX 360 before selling it a long time ago and purchasing it on sale on here about a year later.The Prince of Persia is back, and he's smoother than ever. With a new engine for the series, new visuals, new gameplay, you'll be hooked. I think besides having one of my favorite characters ever lead the way again, the other part that got me hooked was the upgrades and the upgrading system itself. I really like games that have this, even if it's minimal. I don't like being stuck with the same set of skills and powers for the entirety of a video game.The Prince is sent to study alongside his brother, Malik, in order to become a great leader. On arrival, he notices his brother's kingdom under attack again, only this time it's much worse. He is forced to rely on a mythical army to stop the invaders of his kingdom. He releases the army, and not only are the invaders turned to sand, but so too are his soldiers. The only thing that's stopping The Prince & Malik from turning are the amulets they acquire from when Malik released the army. Find out more by playing this amazing game.I really like the smoothness of everything, from the combat to the parkour we all know and love. The Prince is also able to upgrade powers he later acquire and uses, his health, energy, attack power, and more! If you're like me, and you want to stay protected during a fight, so you don't have to scavenge too much for health and energy, then upgrade the power that armors you.I recommend playing this game with a controller. Logitech gamepad's work easily with this.The developers were able to combine SoT & WW into one fantastic game, and I couldn't have kinder words about it. I only wish there was some kind of epilogue DLC, where The Prince runs into something he has to deal with on the journey back home to his father. That would've made the game even more epic.I look forward to more Prince of Persia games.Overall: 10/10PS. This was NOT a tie-in to the film, so don't expect anything to connect the two. Also, this took place BETWEEN Sands of Time and Warrior Within. A lot of people are forgetting that. I hope the next game will offer some kind of combo system, but I don't expect to see more than what I saw in Warrior Within, unless the next game is set after the trilogy.			"

												I just finished this game after beating every single PoP Game in a row on the hardest difficulty and I must say: This game really gives me hope for the PoP Franchise.After the 2008 PoP Reboot I was really worried about PoP as a whole. I beat it, was really dissapointed and moved on to the last entry of the franchise: PoP The Forgotten Sands. Now don't get me wrong, this game is by far not perfect. I would not even go as far as to say it is particularly good. Moreover it is so short that I can really understand if people who bought this game at full price or even half the full price feel betrayed. But it adresses alot of issues the well known sands of time trilogy had with fresh ideas that could lead to some really awesome PoP Games in the future. Heres a list of my personal views on this game:Story:The story is nothing special but it is serviceable. The Djinn focused setting is a really fresh and cool idea. I would love to see future PoPs delve into persian mythology instead of coming up with a generic ""we need a tie-in to the sands of time universe""-story.Presentation:The graphics are alright for my standards but people who demand flashy graphics will not be impressed. Enemy design is kind of cool but nothing extraordinary. The voice acting is surprisingly good and does not feel out of place. The animation quality is a bit of a setback since the prince does not feel as fluid in his movements as he did in the sands of time trilogy. The princes sword looks freaking badass.Fighting:The fighting is very bland. You basically only need one button and constantly hit hordes of enemies in a very slow fashion. Flashy acrobatic combos are also missing - something that upsets a lot of people. Let me say, I am not one of them. As I mentioned above I beat all PoPs that let me choose difficulty at the highest possible setting. It may be an issue with those difficulties but to me the combat system in the SoT trilogy was pretty boring. Combos were very often just blocked by enemies after the second hit and you could easily be interrupted. The most efficient way of dealing with enemies was to either dash from a wall, grab hit them until they die or jump over them and hit them until they die. So even though there were various really cool looking combos I personally did not feel rewarded for using them. At some point in Warrior Within I got so upset with the fighting system and how boring and tedious I felt it was, that I started just throwing enemies off of cliffs to dispose of them quickly. In two thrones I rather died on purpose and retried to stealth kill the enemies instead of taking the fight because those enemies had like a quadrillion health on the hardest difficulty. The fact that they added experience and a slight RPG-Style customization for the Prince in Forgotten Sands gave the fighting some purpose. I hope they can keep this formula and just replace the bland fighting system with something better. Platforming:The platforming in this game is pretty awesome for a PoP title. It is not the most difficult platforming ever. But the added water manipulation and the ability to recall structures from the past just made me feel really good when platforming. Alternating between solid and liquid water to pass waterfalls while still grabing the stream coming from the wall that I just recalled from the past in midair was just a really awesome feeling.Biggest Issues:The worst thing about this game is how short it is. You can finish it in 5 to 8 hours if you are an experienced PoP player. And even if this is your first PoP title it will probably not take you longer than 12 hours at max. Also the more european looking prince is a real bummer. But I honestly think that was just changed in order to make him resemble the movie actor.Verdict:Do I recommend this game ? Probably not to everyone. But if you are a PoP fan or just like a nice game that keeps you entertained for a few hours and you can grab it for 2 to 5 bucks then it can be a really nice game to take a little break from super engaging AAA titles and enjoy some really cool platforming. If you LOVED SoT and hope to find more SoT in this game: Stay away. This game is very unlike SoT and will dissapoint you.			"

												Still not finished, but I've had enough.Pros:+ Very, very funny level design, with the most complex and amazing exploration mechanics in the Prince of Persia franchise;+ Secondary abilities, very useful in combat, adding depth to the choice (and level up).... and that's all, because as Cons:- Combat system is shallow per se, nothing matches the amazing work of Warrior Within and alas, this came after that and is worse (also, enemies variety is ridiculous: how many types are there, like, 4?);- Camera often misleading the player to die even if not at fault - Ubisoft, it's not the first time!;- Bosses also quite shallow, no need to make up strategies: just slash them until they fall;- UPlay. I guess that's the answer to this awful bug: every once in a while, I started the game and waited in front of a neverending black loading screen. Process was stuck, not answering. Unable to start the game. It could even be a decent game, if the experience was not ruined by this bug. Oh, how many times I had to reinstall all the damn thing and it still didn't work. Warrior Within is much better, if you can cope with crappy textures and resolution.			"

												Forgettable story, linear levels, some technical snafus, boss copy-pasting, combat issues... the list of bits that don't quite cut it is long and it is all over far too quickly, yet Forgotten Sands is a fine addition to the Prince of Persia storyline that plays well and manages to capture some of the platforming magic of Sands of Time.A welcome return to the Prince we all know and love, but I think that now we know him just a little too well.It's really trying to be as brilliant and engaging as Sands of Time - but it does not succeed. Forgotten Sands is just a good, solid action-adventure with lots of fun moments, especially when it comes to acrobatics. But the combat feels blunt and the story is downright uninspired. Still, if you like the series, you should definitely give a try.			"

												If you fancy recapturing the original outing with a few new tricks while reinventing the story then forgotten sands will satisfy that itch.My only gripes are i felt detached from the new story as it wasnt for me anyway as quaint as the original, the upgradable powers werent that stunning but still useful, the genie given powers didnt come soon enough not that thats a deal breaker.On the up side i enjoyed marrying the powers and never got tired of falling of stuff through a miscalculated button press which is the way it should be rather than the on the rails feel far to many games put out these days.Its not as good as original lara croft offerings but it did even when the original was first released provide an alternative choice.An easy going pickup and play worth the effort, just not worth the standard asking price so keep in mind when in a sale.

Utterly ForgettableAs someone who loves the Sands of Time Trilogy, I absolutely cannot recommend buying this game. Reasons why are below.Plot: Not much of a plot. The Prince visits his brother (huh, he has a brother?) in Azad and they have boring banter. Something something, the brother unleashes an ancient army, something something, sand monsters, something something, brother is taken over by an evil djinn. Honestly, I took a three month hiatus from this game and when I came back wasn't overly compelled to restart, and I still don't feel like I missed much of the plot, as forgettable as it was. 1/10Characters: The three characters who have any real dialogue in the game are probably some of the most bland and slowest talkers I've ever witnessed. Where's the snappy banter between the Prince and Farah in Sands of Time and Two Thrones? Why do the cutscenes take five minutes to go over details that should be said in five seconds, details that I already know? We don't get to know much of the Prince's brother Malik aside from the fact that he's a warrior leader and thinks he's hot stuff. All we learn of Razia is that she's a good djinn who opposes the evil djinn that killed all the other good djinn. The prince is neither the witty, snarky prince of SoT, the angrier, cynical prince of WW, or the wiser but stilll sarcastic prince of TT. Overall, characters get a 0/10.Graphics: The graphics were alright, but nothing superb. The villain was a generic demonic design, the sand monsters were bland (if high-res) sand monsters. The human characters looked pretty good, but the Prince doesn't look anything like the Prince from the original trilogy. 5/10Combat Mechanics: Slow and clunky. The Prince takes forever to wind up an attack (feels like he's waiting to see if you're charging up your attack before he swings, like in the old 2D games) and will often attack an enemy nowhere near the one you were trying to hit. That's because anytime you enter combat (about every two minutes or so) you have to face at least 10, if not 20 or 30 enemies at once. There's no block button, so you have to rely on dodge-rolls to avoid attacks, and it just doesn't work well with that many enemies all trying to get a piece of you. There aren't any secondary weapons like in WW or TT, the only variation is kicking enemies that have shields to lower their guard, and you can't do any acrobatic attacks aside from jumping onto an enemy and stabbing or kicking them. They tried to make it more cinematic (you occasionally get a special kill cam where he will kick an enemy off a cliff or stab them throught he head) and, unsurprisingly, I felt more like I was watching a movie than playing a game. The only time power you have is rewind, and your other powers, as far as I can tell are useless in a fight. Once you get the sword towards the end of the game, combat becomes more of a mindless button mash than anything else, because enemies die in one hit, or two if they have a shield. Overall, combat gets a 2/10Exploration Mechanics: This is the heart and soul of a Prince of Persia title! Wall runs, jumps, rolls, using powers to get to new heights! This was the only place where the game shined at all, but unfortunately it was only a spark that died in the wind. You start the game with nothing, and once the sand army is unleashed, you get rewind. Alright, cool, you can undo mistakes. Then a bit later you get the Flow power that lets you stop water. That's pretty awesome, too! You use this to run up frozen sheets of water, swing on pillars and columns of it. They even throw in some fun tricky timing bits where you have to pause the flow of the water, jump onto it, jump off of it, unpause, then repause it to catch the next segment. Pretty cool!Then you get a power that lets you home in on enemies after jumping off a ledge. Okay, that's alright I guess, why didn't you just give me this earlier though? And then, in the last hour of gameplay, you get the ability to rebuild crumbled pieces of the architecture one at a time and that's... pretty alright, but they sort of wasted any potential for it because you use it in exactly three areas of the game leading to the final area, then not at all going to the final boss.So what gives? Why give us a new power every quarter of the game instead of introducing them in pretty quick succession? ""Here's time powers. Get used to those. Alright, now here's the flow. Learn to use that with rewind and we'll give you the glide boost. Learn to use glide boost and then we'll give you reconstruction. Now, enjoy the whole game with all these."" That makes a lot more sense than spreading them out over the course of the entire game.The free running and pole swinging and all is a lot slower compared to SoT, WW, and TT. You jump, and the prince takes a second to leap. You hit a pole you have to swing on, and he fumbles his grab, so you have to wait for him to come to a complete stop, then tilt the analog stick in the proper direction for him to swing. That's right, the swing button is no longer mapped to the same button as wall runs.While some of the mechanics are fun, the rest just sort of felt tacked on and not all that useful in the long run, and this whole game just feels really slow compared to previous games. 6/10 and I'm being generous.So, all in all, the game isn't worth getting unless you have to complete your collection. Characters are bland and nowhere near as witty, the story is utterly forgettable, the combat is somehow slow and arbitrarily hard at the same time, and the exploration mechanics are so-so. Overall score: 2.8/10 "

												This is another installment of the Sands of Time series of the Prince of Persia. While is not the best in the series, proves to add some improvements to the whole gameplay; a new and somehow fresh story about the Prince of Persia (kinda short if you ask me) has the typical elements of the series, such as: the puzzle rooms, sword fights and some confusing ""extra"" powers. One of the big differences compared to the other games is definitely the combat as this time you fight hordes of enemies which will grant you experience to unlock more skills and/or powers. At first can be fun to fight a lot of enemies, but after a while it is somehow repetitive as there are too many enemy variations.Graphics and the environments are okay and probably way better compared to the other games. Music is okay too. Probably where the game shines is in their puzzles and room exploration as you progress you will get a power which will change the room exploration greatly (you will know while going through the story, but don't want to spoil it for you).Compared to the other games this game has a challenge mode, which is pretty much survive 7 waves of enemies to get more experience and unlock the Prince's skills in story mode. Not really difficult to beat, specially if you have the sword and life upgrades already.I'd recommend this game only if you played the previous games in the series and you are curious about this game, otherwise you will feel the game is really short and doesn't have too much content, for the same reason pick it up when is on sale.

												The Prince of Persia series has a big nostalgia factor for me and I would have to say this one has been the worse one I've played.  This game commits just too many sins for me to ever be able to recommend it.The game does not go to far away from the POP formula.  You have to platform through the room to get to the next room which I typically enjoy and did enjoy in this game.  Albeit they show the path most of the time when you enter a room which really destroyed the puzzle aspect for me.  The puzzles themselves were not difficult.  I would say I probably enjoyed the first half of the game but then it started to just feel uninspired for the last half and I didn't like the final boss fight at all just fight wrong.My biggest problem with the game is it feels like ubisoft rushed it out to time it with the movie and there are multiple bugs and during my 6-7 hour playthrough (I left it on which is why my hours are inflated), it probably crashed 6 times and would become unresponsive if I opened the steam overlay whenever I wanted to chat with a friend.  It saved often enough that I didn't lose much progress but I feel that is far too frequent.  Some of the controls for the second half made it feel the prince was not listening to me.The second biggest problem for me is I was playing on the harder difficulty and the enemies just gave no issues in fact the entire combat felt boring, luckily it did not require much brain power so I could just quickly plow through it.  But the final boss final was pretty much just combat, and he had an attack that knocked me down and for some reason if the prince gets knocked down he just stays on the ground for what feels like forever (Probably 3-8 seconds).   This caused the boss would follow up with another hit killing me.  So if my prince got knocked down he was dead in this battle.  I guess they felt that's how they would make the final boss hard, but it just felt like bad design.I thought the story was servicable but entirely forgetable.  I don't expect good story from the POP series so I was not really disappointed.Overall I would say not the worse game but the worse POP game I've played.  I feel if you just want a adventure/3D platformer and you've played through all the better ones then I would give this some consideration but I feel there are just better games on the market.			"

												A pretty decent game that took a while to grow on me. The game play is really basic, and the combat is way too easy. The platforming gets a ♥♥♥♥♥ tricky by the end, and the combat really doesn't change at all. I would personally like them to take a risk with the next PoP. Climbing gets really tiring, and part of that problem stems from Asssassins Creed. Get away from repetition, and have some more variety. An alright experience for $2-$3.			"

												This game is just awesome! First of all, it has a spectacular graphics for a 2010 video game and yet it's pretty optimised, the cutscenes look amazing, all credit goes to the next-gen Anvil engine (the same award-winning engine which was used to develop video games like Assassin's Creed II). Secondly, it has an engaging story which is full of suspense with a tragic ending. The soundtracks of this game are worth praising, they're mainly battle-themed and match the situations well. The gameplay is pretty much like the older Prince of Persia games (except the combos, which are not present in this game), but the level design can often scare the hell out of you! But the game is quite short (~9 hours). Nevertheless, it's the last (and maybe the final) instalment of the Prince of Persia series and it's worth buying (the price is very low now). It's recommended to buy the deluxe edition of this game during a sale (the price drops to $9.99) as you'll get two exclusive skins, one exclusive map, the soundtrack of the game and a free digital copy of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time too!

												If you like the Prince of Persia Story then this game falls right next to the other PoP game that was released only a few years ago (the turban one). The story is pretty weak and the controls aren't that grand. The fact that you have to put a lot of work on controling water and pressing other buttons in sequence doesn't help either. I give it a 5/10 only cause I thought that it had decent graphics and interesting characters. Lastly, there is no blocking, everything is done as a role. So my fingers were hurting at the end.

												Buggy as all hell.I'm a big fan of POP, Mirror's Edge, Portal, and really any game that requires quick-thinking acrobatic feats to finish it. They're a gem. I also very much enjoyed The Sands of Time, and looked forward to the sequel. However, when I can't rotate on a pillar without finding myself falling in space surrounded by an infinite skyline, some of the puzzles are impossible. These bugs make the game unplayable.When I see that Ubisoft has finally fixed these bugs, on a very aged game, I'll be happy to take this review down. The graphics are breathtaking and detailed, and the plot line (as of yet) is quite good. However, given my inability to finish the game on this platform, I can't recommend it. These bugs are the result of sloppy programming, and should have been fixed ages ago.			"

												This Prince of Persia game, being the only of its kind for this series, thus far, has a simple battle system which stays true to the roots of the PoP fighting engine. The ability unlock system gave me optional ways to destroy my enemies as well as make the game gear more towards my advantage. The environment was gorgeous and the puzzles were complex enough for even the truest of PoP fans that it would be a decent head-scratcher. The story did move me a bit, as it was a ""fight for your kingdom"" plot, but put me to actually beomce motivated about finishing this game, which is why I believe Ubisoft did an amazing job with this wonderful game.

I remember playing these games on my phone way back and seeing it in crisp 3d is something else.I'll list down the things that make this game fun to play as well as the things that make this game annoying to play.Pros of the game:-Its a Prince of Persia game.-Simple combat system!-Powers!-Swords!-The Prince's Facial Hair!-Platforming with traps!-Hilarous Ragdolling!-Swordplay!-Kill Cam! (well..yeah, sort of kill cam)-Art style and art direction!-Voice acting!-Graphics!-Ambient sounds!-Environment Puzzles!-Skills and or powers and such!-Ezio Auditore Da Firenze Skin!-Getting stuck in the traps!-Rewind ability!-The Prince's Facial hair!-Persian prince that in no way sounds persian!-Some Alternate Outfits!-An Arena Mode!-It has a story!-SAND!Cons:-Controls get stuck and most times it is awkward as hell.-No block mechanism.-No targeting mechanism.-Platforming on some parts are laughably easy and some are frustratingly hard (Mostly cause of the awkward controls)-Animations could have been smoother.-Predictable Enemy Boss/Mini-bosses-Not much diversity when it comes to enemies.-Some of the powers are useless and some are OP-Prince does not get up fast enough when ragdolled.-Difficult camera angles + the awkward controls make for artificial difficulty.-Short story on the main campaign.-Ending was lackluster.-Somehow it feels like a blatant sequel-bait game.-Story itself was lacking depth.-Cheap♥♥♥♥♥FINAL BOSS.-The arena extends play time but i'd prefer if there were missions or a separate campaign with Malik instead (with his half of the amulet at least..oops. spoiler)-The water power could be utilized for other things other than making climbable objects but it wasn't utilized that way.-You'll only ever need the Whirlwind and Ice Blast power. The other two are obsolete and are just there as stat fodder.-You don't get to wear Malik's mask if you have the Malik skin.I give it a 6.5/10Cause its a good game which could have been great if there were more to it than just this.Pick it up on a sale cause you won't regret it if you get for less.Cheers			"

												I don't know what others are thinking, but this game is short, boring and uninspiring. I recommend playing PoP Sands of Time / Warrior Within / Two Thrones. this is not even near the latter in terms of storyline, gameplay. Hell graphics is good but who cares i would play warrior within again and again.			"

												2008's critically acclaimed series reboot ""Prince Of Persia"" was a breath of fresh air, with hip characters and a hauntingly beautiful world. But Jordan Mechner stepped in and fired everyone involved if they would not rotoscope his wiener and here is the result. Oh, it's fine, but I literally tabbed out of the game at the beginning to make sure I didn't install 2003's ""Sands of time"" by mistake. That and the fire arrows at the beginning are just lazy. This is a major step BACKWARDS and a bitter disappointment. More Elika & The Prince, please			"

												I didn't have high expectations for this one. The graphics looked dated, even when it was announced, and I just didn't like the new design of the Prince. I still think all of that, but the game itself is very cool. The combat is a bit simplistic, but it does the job. The platforming however is awesome. I had a great time with it, especially when the game introduced the ability to 'freeze' water. That's what Prince Of Persia is all about; acrobatics. The puzzles were somewhat fun, but that's not the reason I play the PoP games. One other downside is that it's too short. It can be finished in about 7-9 hours. I still recommend this one, it's worth it. Now, Ubisoft, release a new one, it's been a while.[Rating: 88/100]			"

												I was a big fan of Sands of Time when it came out but never really bothered with the series except for trying out the reboot ""Prince of Persia"". This is the first one I have bought since SoT and I'm definitely glad I did. I'll admit I was fairly sceptical about buying this game and it would never have come to my attention if it wasn't on offer but I own it now and I don't regret it. The game has an alright story, its nothing special but the characters never acted unreasonable or stupid which I had expected.The graphics aren't too bad considering it came out in 2010, definitely nothing special although the facial animations were pretty good, at least for the Prince anyway. The voice acting was also pretty decent, the characters were convincing except for the occasional interruption of a puzzle by the Prince inner monologuing about how to solve it.The parkour was up to the usual PoP level and with a few very welcome additions. The abilities to freeze water and teleport makes for some really interesting gameplay and adds a time element to the levels. However even though I could never place my finger on why, the sense of scale and feeling of progress wasn't as strong as in SoT. I regularly lost track of why I was going the way I was and the heights weren't brought to my attention very much. Luckily this didn't really take much away from gameplay.The combat conjured some very mixed feelings. It started out being very boring, just chopping at enemies and moving on. I was really dissapointed to see my favourite elements removed since SoT. No longer did I feel like I was taking down bulky enemies through agility and manuevering, now I was the bulky one and I could chop them down in a few swings. But as the game went on and I experimented more and more I found it was decently varied and not as bad as I first thought. However late into the game you are given a powered-up sword and for the first five minutes I got a kick out of killing enemies in one hit. But then I realised any and all strategy it once had was gone. The game started out as expected but entertained me throughout until the final boss, a clunky giant with lumbering swings and poor reactions, pretty standard and very boring but forgivable.Overall I really liked this game, if you have never played Prince of Persia don't go for this one, start with sands of time. If you are a fan then buy this one, it's actually pretty good.			"

												A great game that follows the styles of combat, obstacles and most things from the original trilogy of Prince Of Persia (The Sands of Time, Warrior Within and The Two Thrones).Been a fan of this series for a huge long time, I used to think the game didn't have that kind of charm and fun in adventure and platforming like the original trilogy, after the spin-off game Prince Of Persia was released back in 2008. (which in my opinion was a good game that has nice story with good characters, though it was a strange spin-off) but I'm really glad I was so wrongObstacles and platforming: - One of the two special charms of the whole series, hard to dispute this game can pull off without these beautifully made mechanism of traps, and the design of the way to guide the player through them. - Some of the obstacles are back from the Original Trilogy (the Spikes, the straight-up high walls, the swinging axes, the running saw wheel..) and some even from the 2008 spin-off game (sliding slope..)- Newer, bigger and much harder obstacles in the game (one of which is the multiple layers of water wall, which in my opinion is the hardest of all obstacles I have ever seen in the whole series, and also the swinging huge thorn tree log)- The platforming has been upgraded to a higher new level, this means whoever still got the mind back when playing the original trilogy, now can rest assured that their style of platforming will be upgraded to a higher new level. Since it requires 1 or 2 more steps to pass the ostacles.- The Saving Checkpoints were arranged nicely , typical of the whole series itselfCombat:- No longer a young prince, this guy now can make a lot of nicer attacks, combos and smoother acrobatic movements. However, The Forgotten Sands does not have the old mechanism of using 2 swords + combos (which were in the original Trilogy) , or stealth kill (The Two Thrones)- One thing has returned from The Sands of Time: You got a fight with a huge platoon of enemies by yourself! But that doesn't mean you can't take them all out.- In fact, the enemies in this game are pretty not that hard to face, which doesn't seem to be much of a concentration in this game, since the design, scenery, platforming element and story of the game are the main focus. - The new system of using 4 natural elements in this game are pretty nice to help you with all the combat, though after a while, you'll recognize that they are only useful in facing some types of enemies.- A whole new system of upgrading (which was only from the spin-off game, not the original trilogy) will help you get so much better. And I agree with this decision of Ubisoft Montreal. No more running around trying to find the upgrades and water sink to recover the health (Warrior Within), you can get Health, Energy and XP from the enemies and vases (which is an old point of the original trilogy)Design and graphic:- The design of the obstacles, the platforming in The Forgotten Sands are smooth- The color when using the elements are really nice, especially when you freeze the time flow of the water, each drop of the water wall is so clear to see and beautifully made.- However,... once again, it seems the enemies are not really the main focus of the game, so they are quite not that well designed, but it doesn't matter, what matters is what they can do to you though.I believe most people who used to play the original trilogy should check this game out and get immersed in the World of the Prince of Persia once more. Even if you haven't played the Trilogy, this game still won't make you feel disappoint at all. In fact, it may even bring you back to play the original trilogy itself!Rating: 9/10 by me. -0.5 because the Djin temple quite lacked the design and change in the 2 pictures (you'll see, they should have recorded the moments of the game) , -0.5 because the challenge mode lacks too much effort invested by Ubisoft.Have fun! P.S: Ezio is also spotted in the game, though in different shape. But who knows, maybe someday AC and POP can be brought together. - Of course, since it was released back in 2010, try to buy the game when it's on sale.			"

I understand that it is a movie tie in, but the cinematic opening wasnt needed, it makes the graphics of the game look worse, which i wouldnt have noticed had there been better continuity. The joy of Prince of persia games is the speed and fluidity of the charicter's animations, which this game didnt have. you dont get a feeling of momentum, rather waiting as he takes far too long to get to the next section			"

												This is pretty terrible.  The double DRM between Steam and Uplay causes several issues, including needing at least 3 forced terminations after clearing various popups from the services telling them to never show again after which all input is dead so you have to alt+f4 the thing.  Follow up with NO graphics settings.  None.  At all.  Move on to a bad tearing issue in the video, wonky camera stuff where you go from having pan controls to not and back again, and it goes from there.  Plays poorly, feels terrible, suffers from a lot, and that was all in the first few minutes.  I don't expect it gets any better.  I could be wrong, but given the gameplay style I'm pretty sure it's like many others of this vintage with the camera annoyances just killing it.			"

												Im a big fan of the first 3 Prince of Persia games and i have to say this one is an insult.Right now u start with a new Prince who is actually saying he is THE prince but really, he isnt, because of the following steps:-He has a new voice, not something hard to hear, its just a complett other voice-over and it sounds crappy.-The 3d-Model looks complete messy, rly it just sucks-He acts again like he did at the start of part 1 but a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥did go down in Part 1 and he isnt the same as he was before all of this All inall this new - old - young prince just seems pretty weird and i couldn`t get a attraction on him or even interest To show what i mean is proven fast, you cant block. No thats no joke you simply cant block. All you do is pressing ctrl if someone is attacking you and between pressing ctrl u do some left clicks, short for a normal attack and long for a strong one and you can combo it up to 5 times in diffrent ways means long-long-short-long-shoert, long-long-long-short-short etc. If you take it this way there are 120 combo-pssibilities! And there is a kick if someone has a shield but forget about this nonsense.No longer 2 swords and diffrent ways to combine left and right handed-hits to freaky  over-the-top moves all you are able to do is left-clicking. Even the wall-slice isnt possible any more. I got bored after the 3th fight.And thats only the fighting system...The Puzzles i met so far (i haven`t played a long time right now and i cant imagine its getting more..) are just boring and simple as hell, maybe some of you still remember the activation of the defense system in Part 1? this one was harder then all of the puzzles right now together,but i have to admit the maybe get better later on.The Sand-Monsters look... i would use some words i dont want to write down right here but they just aint cool. Its like a zombie out of an 60`s zombie movie, its like the complete cliche and the story feels like: Blablabla hit these zombies now! The story wasn`t the strongest part in the other games neither, but this one beats them all. His brother gets introduced as the new sidekick, but to compare him with farah or even.Kaileena is absurd.I played the spin-off Prince of Persia (2008) which was pretty funny for me as long as uyou dont expect too much and so i  looked forward to play this game, but im completely dissapointed and all thats left to me is telling everyone who loved the old Games and   was close to Tears when the Prince and Farah stand on the top of the Babylon palast and he starts to tell her the fairytale of the first part again, dont buy this one and left him as your memories as he are and as he deserves to be.

There are a few challenge modes that focus on combat, but nothing substantial.

												I had a more thorough review thought out, but I'll be damned if I put more thought into the review than I put into the game itself. There are worse ways to spend your money on Steam, but there are better ways. If you can get a really good sale for a pack that includes Sands of Time, or you're desperate for a Prince of Persia fix and are willing to settle, then get it. Otherwise, Forgotten Sands is competent, but forgettable.My first PoP game was Sands of Time (often considered the defining title), but that was only a couple years ago. No nostalgia blindness here. Sands of Time not only holds up after 13 years, but was a superior experience to this one. Forgotten Sands has just the right amount of minor bugs to ruin any sense of immersion without driving you from the game completely. The combat is boring, repetitive, and sometimes blatantly padded. The platforming is adequate, though far from the best in the franchise. The dialogue is competently written, but ""get the macguffin"" hardly qualifies as a plot and a character saying ""oh golly I feel less anxious about _____ now"" hardly qualifies as character development.

												Reminiscent of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, The Forgotten Sands improves combat but fails to top the platforming puzzles. It's a shorter game and enemy variety is lacking but still a fun experience if you can grab it on discount ($2.50 is about right). It also has the bonus of being a proper PC game, unlock like unfortunate ports of the Sands of Time trilogy, so you can plug in your controller and go with it. The plot and writing is as underwhelming as Sands of Time, though it lacks the sauciness and has slightly better voice acting.			"

												I'm a hardcore Prince fan, what can I say. Purple Rain is my favorite song. ...wait. Not that Prince.Forgotten Sands is pretty decent so far. I have no idea how far I am through it, but I can't be more than about 25% done (it takes me a long time to play a game, OK?). It's not the best in the franchise, and it's certainly not my favorite. But if you like Prince of Persia, eh...why not? It's super cheap on Steam right now. The music is awesome, the graphics aren't mind-blowing but they're pretty good, and the story is enganging enough that it keeps me wanting to play it.The Ubisoft start-up menu is annoying as hell. (You start the game, which starts Steam, and then it starts Ubisoft's community thing on top of that, and THEN you start the effing game, so be sure to build in an extra 10 minutes in when you want to play to get beyond all that crap! Jesus, Ubisoft!.) Also, you really, really (really, really, really) need a joystick or game pad to play and perform combos effectively unless you are some kind of a savant with WASD. I am not (I recommend the Logitech Gamepad F310 for PS3 users. If you prefer Xbox, you're on your own.).Other than that, it's the same snarky Prince we all know and love. Though this time he seems to be keeping all his clothes on. Shucks... :(			"

												Disclaimer: Did not finish the game. Played a cracked version to ~60% because Ubi servers were down when I bought (or licensed?) it some years ago. Tried this legit version only to find it no better today.+ A PoP game that captures some of the serie's essence+ Controls are not horribly set up (controller), but the combat feels like swinging a mace and not a sword+ I got 2500+ fps in the Main menu, steady 60 in game with a 980ti. The Ubisoft opening logo animation juttered between 15-25fps    - Alt tabbing, opening the Steam overlay or launching the game with my 360pad on (wireless) leads to the game not responding to anything except Alt F4. Turning the pad on after the 'Press any key to start' screen works.- Eye wounding flashing graphical glitches, almost like z-fighting but in the effect shaders, I think- Graphics settings only list Brightness (AA & Vsync can be turned on from a setup file in the game folder)			"

												Probably the best Prince of Persia game to date. I don't understand the hate for this game, it's underrated as ♥♥♥♥.Gameplay is more fluid than ever with top notch animations and completely renovated parkour mechanics as well as a mix of cool powers besides controling time, such as controling water and other cool♥♥♥♥♥♥ it makes the platforming and solving puzzles so much more ♥♥♥♥ing fun. It's also the first PoP game with which I have had trouble completing some puzzles, it's really challenging at certain points but I was never fustrated while playing it unlike some of the previous games.Thank ♥♥♥♥ for this new combat system, the combat in previous games was SUCH a drag sometimes, specially in Warrior Within, felt forced as ♥♥♥♥ but I had to push through it to get to cool platforming. In Forgotten Sands though, I actually enjoyed fighting enemies and there's a perfect balance between action and plaforming through out the whole game, the enemies themselves even serve a purpose in a lot of platforming sections which wasn't seen before in the series. You also get this skill tree system to unlock cool new powers for fighting the big waves of enemies the game throws at you. There's a cool enemy variety, as well as really cool monster designs and boss battles. The game even has a challenge mode just for pure gameplay fun.The level design and environments are absolutely top notch, my favorite in the series so far. Gorgeous graphics. Amazing soundtrack as always. The prince still has the original voice actor and still has his funny personality from Sands of Time, you get to hear his witty comments and funny remarks all the time. So it still feels like a true PoP game within the original trilogy.This game was obviously a tie in with the Sands of Time movie that came out in 2011 so the story is simple and short, and honestly, I prefer it that way. Two Thrones already set a perfect ending to the trilogy and it would suck if they started messing around with characters like Farah, The Vizier, Kaileena or even the Dahaka.Overall, this game was an absolute joy to play through, it was so fun I beat it in one day. It's quite sad it has such an unfair score\reception by people. Are they blinded by nostalgia or were they actually hoping this game would continue where the trilogy left off? This game was honestly a surprisingly really great attempt at rebooting the series and it's a shame Ubisoft didn't go through with it.			"

												I wanted to like Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands. I love the (admittedly westernized) genre of strong princes and fair princesses set against a backdrop of rocky mountains, roiling sand and Moorish castles. I was hoping to get some of that with some good graphics, music, story, and some climbing thrown in. Well, forget the story. There is one, but not so you'd notice. The game is a series of climbing puzzles / challenges, with some hack 'n slash combat every so often. The combat is fairly easy, and the puzzles, with two exceptions, are not that hard to solve. Actually playing the puzzles through, though, is intensely frustrating (I play exclusively with a keyboard + mouse). Lag is extraordinarily high. The game is sometimes not sensitive enough to input, and at other times too sensitive. Some skills and abilities are on a timer (freeze water for X number of seconds), so what seems a minor annoyance at the beginning of the game magnifies into greater and greater significance later on (expect The Aqueducts level to really give you trouble). I can put up with all that, though. The killer blow for me is the same thing I hated in Ubisoft's sister platformer, Assassin's Creed. Get into a place with one path forward, and the camera view locks up: you can't turn and look to see where you need to go without just blindly following the path indicated by the camera lock-up. I absolutely HATE this; I hated it in Assassin's Creed, and I hate it here. In this case, without the ability to look around, you'll die multiple times until you realize, oh, I need to go in X direction, so I need to do the upwards back-and-forth-between-walls climb three times to reach my objective ledge. Incredibly frustrating, and for me a game-breaker. As  I said, the story is near non-existent. An invading army is attacking the castle, so the Prince's brother Malik unleashes King Solomon's army - of sand soldiers. The Prince has to figure out a way to corral the army - and stop his brother, who seems to be accumulating the power of the sand-soldiers with each one he kills. Whatever. I never really felt a connection to any of the characters. They're just there as an excuse for some platforming. The graphics are good, even by 2010 standards - fire looks very realistic - but the water is strangely low-res. And there is a lot of water in this game. The music is suitably evocative, but after capturing the initial mood, is repetitive and unexciting (thought the orchestration uses a number of different instruments and it sounds well-played).Incredibly disappointed in The Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands. Not because it is bad per se, but because frustrating gameplay mechanics mean I'll be moving on to something else.			"

												While it's a decent addition into the Prince of Persia series, that's all it is, decent. For the PoP fans out there, that'll be enough for now to sate their appetite for a competent platformer. However, I can't recommend this game to any other type of audience. The story seems rushed, and while sure, story isn't everything in a platformer, that, combined with lackluster combat and poor camera control makes this feel scraped together. If you are looking for good platforming, it works well in that area, if you are looking for more than that, and can deal with outdated graphics, go for the Sands of Time trilogy instead.			"

												It's last big PoP game made by Ubisoft. It's not bad, but not as good as Sands of Time trilogy. I bought it on sale few years ago and finally I'm trying to finish it. Plot is rather bad, level design is average. It's probably better than PoP with Elika, but nothing more than a movie tie in.One thing about this game is that each platform has it's own game. PC version is the same the X360 and PS3 got. Wii got completely different game. Way better, with new powers, better plot, better controls with good enough graphics.If you played Sands of Time Trilogy, buy this game. If you haven't get those three great games instead.			"

This game is a blast and fun for anybody who's a fan of Tomb Raider, Prince of Persia, Assassins Creed, or pretty much any story based platforming games. My only complaint would be that it's a bit short. The prince's dialogue can also be somewhat frustrating to listen to. But freezing water and running off of walls make this game so worth it. I'd recommend getting it if it gets to $10 or cheaper.			"

												One of the better platforming action games I've ever played. I've beaten this a long time ago on console so I know it is good from start to finish. The graphics are very good (for its time) and the entire game looks outstanding. The sound is great and the controls are smooth and solid and very intuitive. The gameplay is smooth and the game engine runs flawlessly. Combat is a lot of fun, especially once you learn new skills. The levels are expertly designed and there are some pretty challenging platforming stages. The game is so much fun to play because it just looks so awesome. I really love the artwork. Overall this is well worth it when you can catch it on sale, and is even a good buy at its normal price. The only downside I've found so far is that the game exe crashes when you exit, which doesn't even matter as long as it is on exit. Doesn't make sense but oh well it doesn't affect anything. Also when you are playing if you bring up the steam overlay then go back to the game, no keyboard keys work anymore for some odd reason, but it can be quickly fixed by alt+tabbing out then back in so it's not much of a big deal. It is also a big time button masher when it's combat time. So to avoid killing your hand from left clicking insanely, use a controller to play. Great game, 8/10			"

												В глаза сразу бросается наконец современная графика, которой не было со времён четвёртой части. Хорошая анимация, сильный графический ""движок"", внимание к мелочам, например монетки вылетающие из под ног или то как принц следит за искорками из порталов. Боевая система упрощена сверх меры, оно бы было не так плохо, если при этом и акробатика не пострадала. Очень слабая планировка уровней, остановка воды многообещающая идея, так и рисующая прогулку по солёным застывшим волнам с зависшими в воздухе каплями, в исполнении обернувшаяся пресными трубами. Вода вытекает из труб и исчезает в воздухе, при остановке даже анимация продолжает играть, а все брызги исчезают и заменяются на стандартную модель. Так же остановка воды не влияется на не заскриптованную воду, например на лужи. Разработчики даже не добавили прогулок по коронам бьющих из под земли фонтанов. Да и всё использование почти не отличается от ""нажми кнопку получи упор для прохождения"", мало того убрали ""розетки"" и настенные трамплины, убрали рычаги, возможность вернуться назад и многое другое. Зато добавили прыжки по врагам в сеть акробатики. Мало того что оно совсем не реалистично, так ещё видимо не учли что видя врага начинаешь искать способ его убить и вернуться в режим акробатики, поэтому часто в упор не видишь способа продвинуться дальше. Говорящим мечом конечно никого не удивишь, но меч бубнящий заклинания при каждом взмахе - интересная идея.Больше всего это похоже на то что Darksiders смешали с Spiderman: Shattered Dimensions и декорациями из четвёртой-шестой частей.

												Sands of Time was possibly one of the greatest games of all time, perfect gameplay and perfect story, along with perfect dialouge and character arcs. So when W.W. turned out too Emo and T.T. was too♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ honestly, it is no surprise to me that Ubisoft wants to go back to when it was good and 'Start Over.'That is essentially what TFS is. It take place right after SoT, following a now square-faced Prince in his Brother's Kingdom.. forgot to mention him, ever. The first time I played this I was in a gleeful trance jumping from platforms to pillars, but felt empty. I'm not sure why but this just doesn't seem as good as the original, however, it is soaringly god-like compared to the 'Re-imaging' i.e '♥♥♥♥-UP' of Prince of Persia back in 2008. So if you are a fan of the Trilogy try this, as it is as close to the BEST one as you can get.(For me Steam over-lay doesn't work right, ♥♥♥♥s up my controls.. suggest shutting it off, since messages would just distract you from the wall plant)			"

												The game is a absolutely winner! Love the scenery, the jumps, puzzles, game mechanics and ofcourse music. I didn't like fights so much, i found them pretty hard (i love elevator part), but with combination of battle music and prince slashing his sword, you can pretty much enjoy them. Nice game and great introduction in POP series.			"

												Forgotten Sands is a solid game with a decent story. The problem is, fitting it between two parts of an existing trilogy means that by necessity, the game can't tell a story that both ties into the plot of the trilogy and is important to the trilogy's plot. As a result, Forgotten Sands is a standalone adventure which has absolutely no relevance to the overarching plot. It's also very similar mechanically and structurally to Sands of Time, but with a few new elements and small tweaks, and without the awesome framing device of the Prince telling his story (that's referenced at the beginning but is quickly abandoned). If you're a fan of the series it's worth playing, but it's not a good place to start your Prince of Persia adventures - Sands of Time is still my favourite and the best jumping-on point.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2012/08/prince-of-persia-forgotten-sands.html "

												Will not be recommending this game until Uplay stops ruining my relationship with prince of persia. First I could not log into Uplay because Uplay was down. I had recently downloaded prince of persia. So it said i couldn't play offline without logging in first. I finally got to log in after about 15 minutes. I then started my game, and immediately my game froze. I had to restart Uplay re-log into Uplay and restart my game. I got into my game and pressed the menu button and my game froze.I had to restart Uplay log back in and start up my game again. This went on for about 30 minutes. I don't know whats going on in this game and probably never will thanks Uplay, Ten dollars of my money well wasted.			"

												Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands™ is a prequel to Warrior Within and a sequel to Sands of Time. It's intended as a lost story from the prince happening right after he comes back to his brother's kingdom.However, the story is plain dumb. It mixes another kind of sands (really? always sands?) and this time the Prince has the power of the Ifrits (some kind of Arabic geniuses-gods-entities) on his side. He can basically do the same he always did: go back and forth in time, freeze it, aerobic combat... all is almost the same.The combat system is refined though, nothing like the previous games. It has more combos. And the upgrade system uses orbs, like God of War. So basically it's a ripoff of itself and other games.Finally, it uses UPlay. That's definitely a downside. Having another DRM client over Steam, needing to log into it and all that, is stupid beyond measure.Anyway, if you're a true fan, you should get it. It's not boring, but it's not magnificent as the previous installments were. Kind of a letdown, to be honest.			"

												Whereas this, in the nicest possible way, is an abomination.It's that most tragic of things: a game that literally did not need to be made. I can see the decision tree that led to it: endless discussions of why the last game didn't sell, why none of the PoP games have reviewed so well since Sands of Time, what they've been doing wrong since they are spending so many millions more on development these days. And someone said: ""Why not just remake Sands of Time?""And that man should be fired.I'm not saying that the Sands of Time was gaming's Citizen Kane - far from it, it's a relatively slight but beautiful piece of artistry, with few depths but rich and glorious shallows - but even now Hollywood doesn't try to remake Citizen Kane on the sole basis that it reviewed well.The sad thing is, it's not a bad game. It just doesn't need to exist.(And the prince looks like he's been badly burned in a house fire. Seriously dude, you need to get to a hospital)			"

												 This game is like that family member you love but sometimes wonder if they are really related to you.  In many aspects it really does feel like a refreshed portion of the trilogy while bringing in fresh new elements, other portions however veer off from what I expected from the game going in. Playing the game when it came out honestly I hated it for stupid reasons but recently replaying it I found it an excellent game and I actually look forward to playing it again sometime. Let me start by saying that this game is in NO way connected to the movie.  This installment is almost completely unconnected to the Sands of Time trilogy, in fact the only character featured in this who was in the trilogy is the Prince.  When I first played the game I really hated this, looking back however I feel a lot of care went into giving the feel of playing the trilogy while still leaving the original story alone. Parkour is where in my oppinion this game shines, it feels like the trilogy on roids in this aspect. Everything just runs so fluid and the Prince is more agile than ever.  As the game progressed you obtain powers that allow you to control the environment which just adds to the amazing vibe the parkour gives off. What else can I say aside from I feel satisfied when I run up walls? Combat is almost completely different from the trilogy, you cannot duel wield in this game which honestly is a little dissapointing from the start for me. The combat in this game seems to focus on taking down numerous enemies at a time. I would be a liar if I said that I didn't enjoy the combat in this game but it could have been greatly improved. With the trilogy it was awesome to use the environment to your advantage, this game however is parkour and combat are hardly ever connected. It's a crying shame actually as I think the abilities you unlock could have had some interesting uses in battle. All in all for me this is a welcome addition to the franchise. If you are a fan of the trilogy I definitely reccomend giving this game a shot as more than likely you will like it. Just remember this has nothing to really do with the trilogy and although that may be a disappointment to some I for one am happy that the trilogy was not tampered with.			"

												All-around solid game despite the difficulty being too easy and fights are a major drawback when compared to even Sands of Time. I would have welcomed a hard or even higher difficulty. Back in early 2000's this was a trilogy that made you buy it as soon as it came out. Now there are hundreds of IP's around, you can almost miss this one (thanks to Ubisoft's overpriced policies).Overall, one of the best deals in Steam this season. Recommended.			"

												This game was hugely disappointing. It's the camera angles. In a game where you live or die by your ability to control the prince, the game dies, because even when you can control him it's painful to do so, and he ends up doing things which look stupid, like jumping at a forty five degree angle instead of directly toward a horizontal pole when missing means death, so it just feels stupid. The rest of the ingredients are all there and if there wasn't the one fundamental flaw which makes all the great features moot it would be one of the best (if not the best) of a good series, but instead it is the worst by a fair margin. If they'd just stuck the camera behind you (or given you that option) with commensurate controls, so you could run toward a pole and jump to the pole rather than having to guess whether you should be jumping ""West"" or ""Northwest""...Seriously this is a three dimensional game, so why should I only be able to move in precisely 8 directions, and those dictated by and gimped by the camera position? So close to a great game and yet so far. "

												If you liked the Sands of Time, you will probably like this one. Sometimes the controls and automatic camera movement can get a little frustrating, but overall it's a nice game. I understand that the automatic camera movement and restrictions are necessary to understand where to go next, but sometimes it switches camera positions while doing an important move which then fails, because you need to switch directions according to the new camera position. Whichs ends up in dying and using another sand/history-slot. Anyway, the music is not as great as the Sands of Time, but the graphics really do make up for it.			"

												Prince of Persia is now back to Sands of Time universe. The Forgotten Sands is interquel happened between Sands of Time and Warrior Within. The Prince visited his brother's kingdom and end up in a war with evil mythical army created by Djinn. Though no Sands of Time involved, the Prince, besides his acrobatics, still got many powers, granted by benevolent Djinn, including time rewind, water freezing and couple of interesting powers. They are spectacular to see and add complexity and fun to traveling. Level design is also cleverly creative, utilizing all Prince's powers. Combat is fluid and dynamic though sometime repetitive. There is no life upgrade but improving with experience and upgrade points which well integrated into the game increasing depth and customization. Story is interesting and Prince's personality is cool though the ending doesn't make an impact. There are also some issues with connection and Uplay. The Forgotten Sands is true to the series and shouldn't be forgotten.			"

												Forgotten Sands is a return to the style of the Sands of Time series. If you played the whole Sands of Time trilogy, and you hunger for more, Forgotten Sands will be perfect for you. If you're hoping for a new take on the franchise, you're looking in the wrong place - Forgotten Sands is not about innovation. It has the same plot and setting as every game in the Sands of Time trilogy, the same old Prince (snarky, not angsty) as ever, and the same kinds of puzzles and fights. (To be fair, the Prince gets a couple new abilities that he's never seen before to spice things up. Nothing groundbreaking, though.) However, it has refined all these so that the bad elements - quick time events, awkward chariot races, angsty Prince from the second game - have been removed and the good ones rebalanced to make them better. It is the Sands of Time trilogy with all the burrs polished away. Don't play this one first, but if you've already done the other three, Forgotten Sands is worth your time.			"

												All-around solid game despite the difficulty being too easy and fights are a major drawback when compared to even Sands of Time. I would have welcomed a hard or even higher difficulty. Back in early 2000's this was a trilogy that made you buy it as soon as it came out. Now there are hundreds of IP's around, you can almost miss this one (thanks to Ubisoft's overpriced policies).Overall, one of the best deals in Steam this season. Recommended.			"

												 This game is like that family member you love but sometimes wonder if they are really related to you.  In many aspects it really does feel like a refreshed portion of the trilogy while bringing in fresh new elements, other portions however veer off from what I expected from the game going in. Playing the game when it came out honestly I hated it for stupid reasons but recently replaying it I found it an excellent game and I actually look forward to playing it again sometime. Let me start by saying that this game is in NO way connected to the movie.  This installment is almost completely unconnected to the Sands of Time trilogy, in fact the only character featured in this who was in the trilogy is the Prince.  When I first played the game I really hated this, looking back however I feel a lot of care went into giving the feel of playing the trilogy while still leaving the original story alone. Parkour is where in my oppinion this game shines, it feels like the trilogy on roids in this aspect. Everything just runs so fluid and the Prince is more agile than ever.  As the game progressed you obtain powers that allow you to control the environment which just adds to the amazing vibe the parkour gives off. What else can I say aside from I feel satisfied when I run up walls? Combat is almost completely different from the trilogy, you cannot duel wield in this game which honestly is a little dissapointing from the start for me. The combat in this game seems to focus on taking down numerous enemies at a time. I would be a liar if I said that I didn't enjoy the combat in this game but it could have been greatly improved. With the trilogy it was awesome to use the environment to your advantage, this game however is parkour and combat are hardly ever connected. It's a crying shame actually as I think the abilities you unlock could have had some interesting uses in battle. All in all for me this is a welcome addition to the franchise. If you are a fan of the trilogy I definitely reccomend giving this game a shot as more than likely you will like it. Just remember this has nothing to really do with the trilogy and although that may be a disappointment to some I for one am happy that the trilogy was not tampered with.			"

Oh, the new abilities in the game for mobility is probably just a minor addition to the gameplay but it's a good touch to The Forgotten Sands.

												This game was hugely disappointing. It's the camera angles. In a game where you live or die by your ability to control the prince, the game dies, because even when you can control him it's painful to do so, and he ends up doing things which look stupid, like jumping at a forty five degree angle instead of directly toward a horizontal pole when missing means death, so it just feels stupid. The rest of the ingredients are all there and if there wasn't the one fundamental flaw which makes all the great features moot it would be one of the best (if not the best) of a good series, but instead it is the worst by a fair margin. If they'd just stuck the camera behind you (or given you that option) with commensurate controls, so you could run toward a pole and jump to the pole rather than having to guess whether you should be jumping ""West"" or ""Northwest""...Seriously this is a three dimensional game, so why should I only be able to move in precisely 8 directions, and those dictated by and gimped by the camera position? So close to a great game and yet so far. "

Sometimes it gets rather complex to do wallruns, freeze, reverse time, etc. which presents a certain level of challenge.Combat is much improved in this game, and is much less boring than in the previous games.

												I have been a prince of persia fan for a long time and I've played every one of them, I would say it is one of my favorite game series of all time. I was one of the people who was disappointed with the  PoP game made in 2008, the cell shaded styled one . I enjoyed it for what it was but I felt it was a move in the wrong direction. I liked the beautiful art design but it really was just too easy.As for this game, considering it was made in 2010 the graphics were very well done. The prince and his surroundings are very detailed and everywhere you look there has been a great attention to creating a beautiful world to enjoy. From the wisps of sand moving below a swinging trap, the great use of light peering through cracks or the fine details on clothing and armor. Everything looks great. Including the newly designed prince. PoP games have always had great graphics and this game continues that tradition.As for the game play, I think it is great how the designers have added the control of elements, like water, into the great gameplay that we saw in the previous games. It really adds a welcome new twist to the action/puzzle solving style this game series has always done so well.I see alot of people knocking the combat, well for me I love it. I like that I can charge my attacks, I like that I can kick enemies down and I really like the addition of finishing moves that are stylish and enjoyable to pull off. Quite simply this is the best combat engine ever use in a PoP game. As for it being easy, well I think it just makes you feel more powerful and I for one enjoy the fact that its not frustrating. It keeps the game moving along and that is something I prefer over games that have overly difficult combat (ex : Ninja Gaiden, Dark Souls) I think it was done purposely because the game was meant to be enjoyed by more than just hardcore gamers.One thing that makes the combat seem easy is the addition of powers that you unlock with experience points. Like an RPG you can spend these points anyway you see fit to give you special abilities like stoneskin or allow you to knockdown all surrounding enemies with a wind based attack. Again I find these abilities a welcome addition to the game and I like the carrot being dangled knowing that I have more and more powerful ones to unlock as I progress through the game.As for the sound I think this was well done, just like everything else in the game. From the voice acting to that music to the background sounds everything works well and never distracts for the experience. Which for me is what good sound design is.I can't help but wonder what it is that gamers and reviewers who knock this game want from their games. This game is polished and fine tuned. It looks great and plays great. It has everything we loved about the past games while injecting some fresh new ideas into the mix. It gives you more of everything. More enemies, more abilities, more combat choice with finishers, new puzzles that use traps and timing as well as the new addition of elements like turning water solid. I think people look for the smallest imperfections when they should be enjoying what is so good in the game.Sure the camera can occasionally be out of place, but what game like this has a perfect camera ? Actually I haven't experienced any real problem with it so far anyway. It has a snap behind button and rotation control, so whats the problem ?Prince of Persia Forgotten Sands is an excellent game and in my opinion the best in the series. It has a great balance of action, combat and puzzle solving all set in a beautiful world and for me thats all I wanted and the team at ubisoft delivered in this latest PoP adventure.			"

The physics is even more ridiculous, as The Prince springs 3 meters into the air from a standing position, but this makes for absolutely delicious animations, as usual by Ubisoft. They managed to get the original voice actor but the plot is paper-thin, so it doesn't really matter. Overall a good game, not as good as SoT, but not bad either.

												Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands returns to a mixture of Sands of Time/Warrior Within combat and momvement, with touches of style from both. There is no dual-weapon combat, but the combat moves are really varied and fluid. There are many new powers/mechanics introduced in this game, and they're all quite fun. Freezing water is great, and adds a nice dimension to puzzles. The recall ability is also really interesting, though not explored as well as I had hoped.The various elemental powers you can upgrade feel like pointless extras when basic combat is maxed out and the whirlwind is maxed out. However, you need to be very careful with point expenditures to be able to unlock the 2x energy drop upgrade.If the game was longer and had a better story, I'd rank it up with the Sands of Time.			"

												Let me start by saying this is the worst Prince of Persia among the recent ones. The story is very simple and comprised of only 4 characters. The combat and character movement are terribly clunky. The camera is annoying during platforming moments (using a controller makes it less awful). The levels are as linear as they can possibly get.Boss battles are bad jokes. Really. According to Ubisoft the best way to kill a giant is to strike his foot multiple times, as he will eventually die.Why am I recommending this game? Simple: I love platforming. Even though it is a terrible game, I enjoyed the platforming sections, obstacles and climbing challenges. Fortunately, it seems like it was known that the combat was so awful that they decided it should be a minor part of the game, so it could be best enjoyed this way.			"

												Prince of Persia is the best action adventure game but this one is different from the older PoP: The Two Throne. In The Two Throne you could kill the enemies silently and fighting with many enemies was harder,We needed to be clever but in The Forgotten Sands you are like one man army,you can kill many enemy by just tapping the attack button.But the gameplay,graphics,actions are very good.

												This is one of the better ones in the series. Perhaps not the best, but still great if you enjoy the series.What is good?Well, it looks nice, has an epic feel, it runs well, the mechanics are solid and controls are tight. It has all the Prince of Persia stuff, design and atmosphere. It has some new interesting gameplay elements as well. The game is not too hard, but not super easy either. It does not become frustrating.What is not so good?It is a little cheesy, and the voice acting is a little silly, but pretty much all the games in the series has had that. It plays much better with a game pad, which is only a negative if you don't have one. There are a couple of frustrating moments in the game, where when you die, you get pushed back quite far from where you died, and you have to see the cutscene again. You can bypass it, but after the umpeenth atempt you get a litte tired. But this is not a problem in general.A causal game?Well, in the beginning I found the game does not offer much challenge, but it is still quite enjoyable as it teaches you the mechanics bit by bit. It also has good variety and pace so it never feels boring. I played through the entire game quite quickly compared to older titles, but I did not mind. At times it felt like a game to play during breaks, hence the casual feel. But it is still an enjoyable experience.			"

												The game works fine on my old PC (Core i3 2.93 GHz, 8GB RAM, Radeon HD4770, Win 7 64Bit). It crashed once, and if you hit Shift+Tab to close Steam overlay, the controller stops working. That's all the technical problems I've encountered. The game runs at 40-50 fps (fine by me) on default settings with dual monitors and HD movies running on the second screen.It's a fun platformer with fluid animation, short and sweet, but casual compared to other PoPs. This game holds your hand a lot. Hardcore fans who like puzzles, figuring out where to go on your own, and deep combat may not like this game. By the way, there's no escort/bodyguard mission. Good!

												If you like the gameplay from the Prince of Persia reboot trilogy, then you may enjoy the game. It took some of the best parts of the gameplay, and assumed that would be enough, making unoriginal puzzles to make use of them.Ignore the story. It has no soul, and the characters have no soul either. You need to walk in caring about the characters from previous games to get into them. Otherwise you're going to be bored.			"

												First of all, this is not the best PoP game, but it does tell a rather interesting story, like all the other PoP games out there.I personally bought the entire series on steam because I wanted ALL the games on pc, not just the last one, and to be fair, there are some weak points in this game.Combat: if you know what you're doing, combat is♥♥♥♥♥♥easy, if not, it may well be that it can prove to be a challenge.Acrobatics: Timing is key. this part of the game is spectacular, not much one can rag on about hereGraphics: they're just fine for a 2010 release, nothing huge here, but deffiniately beautiful from time to time, nice details here and there.Compared to the other PoP games (the 3 first game as the 4th was mediocre at best): This game has an okay story, a little wonky combat, but that doesn't mean it's the worst game ever. The original was certainly something that got me into the series, that doesn't mean it's the best, I loved Warrior Within like no other. Two thrones was a little on the meh side, but still a solid game! This however, is a totaly different game and I enjoyed it. A LOT. And to be fair, this isn't really a PoP game, yes it does share some of the powers and stuff like that, but it just isn't the same as the 3 first ones. (and for gods sake, its not as horrible as the 4th.)All in all I'd give this game a solid 7/10. If it wasn't just a cheap cash-in on a popular franchise I'd probably give it a 8/10, but oh well, here you have it.7/10, would play again. twice!			"

												A good sequel to the first game. Overall the game is very reminiscent of the first game from the platforming, some of the combat and the Prince's personality/musings. Compared to the original a bit of the platforming and much of the combat has been streamlined/tweaked in terms of jumping from poles or not having to ""finish off"" every enemy. The upgrades were rather simple/straightforward though felt like it could be expanded on. A big complaint were technical issues with the game involving a certain black screen... so if you happen to encounter that hopefully this will help http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=20207732&postcount=5 "

												The Forgotten Sands is basically a retelling of Sands of Time minus the charm and fun. The game doesn't even get good until the last couple hours. There's no way to adjust  the controls or graphics settings. The game is buggy and requires Ubisofts extra DRM scheme Uplay to for this strictly single-player only game. It's a very unwelcome intrusion to the game experience. In game bonuses are unlocked via it and it doesn't update properly. ♥♥♥♥ing thing sucks! I can not recommend any game that uses this.

												Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands returns to a mixture of Sands of Time/Warrior Within combat and momvement, with touches of style from both. There is no dual-weapon combat, but the combat moves are really varied and fluid. There are many new powers/mechanics introduced in this game, and they're all quite fun. Freezing water is great, and adds a nice dimension to puzzles. The recall ability is also really interesting, though not explored as well as I had hoped.The various elemental powers you can upgrade feel like pointless extras when basic combat is maxed out and the whirlwind is maxed out. However, you need to be very careful with point expenditures to be able to unlock the 2x energy drop upgrade.If the game was longer and had a better story, I'd rank it up with the Sands of Time.			"

												Pros: undoes the excessive streamlining of controls that mars the series up to this point. You can actually fight dozens of enemies in a single fight, and for discount Arkham combat, it's not bad. Slightly more actual enemy variety. Decent mechanics for combat, acrobatics, puzzles, traps, and great balance between how much they appear in this, albeit few to no real changes or additions. Saving Checkpoints are very well-placed. Great design all the way... everything looks and sounds great. Pretty much every good element from the series is in this, and they almost all work.Cons: as is typical for midquels: irrelevant and, yeah, forgettable, through and through: story, location, conflict, enemies, characters(other than the Prince), etc. Watered down traps. Plays it too safe. Lazy, half-hearted attempt at recapturing the, well, magic, of the Sands of Time trilogy: it especially wants to be the first of those three, with an opening way too similar. Why does control of the four elements essentially amount to a handful of parlor tricks? Bland magic powers, and they replace, rather than being added to, the use of Time manipulation during combat: all that's left is Rewinding(which in this doesn't comes from the Sands of Time. How many different magic sources in ancient Persia let you rewind time?). Stiff control of the Prince, especially with the Rewind, which feels like you have to rewind a certain amount, rather than you pinpointing the second you want to proceed from. Being knocked down half the time glitches to where it's difficult to get back up for a few seconds. Enemy AI kind of just... stops if enemies aren't in a group, and a few meters away from you. We're back to slash-at-the-calves boss fights. This is a few years into Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed producing, and so this does have some of “it looks cool but isn't that challenging”.My recommendation: if like me you love this franchise, or at least this kind of game, it's a fine installment. If not, go for one of the others, and in general, skip this one. Note that this version, for the PC, is the same as for Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, but completely different from the Wii version.			"

TL;DRThis is basically Prince of Persia: SoT, climbing puzzles and all, with a few God of War elements slipped in. It starts slow at first and man does it feel its age, but gets pretty good halfway through.How long is it? Main game is about 6 hours, NG+ and bonuses add a few more.Did you like it? Yeah, but it took a while for me to warm up to.How much should I spend on it? Around $5. Wait for a sale, or get Sands of Time.=== Overview ===Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands tries to bring back a lot of what made the Sands of Time game successful - the frantic, skill-based jumps and puzzles, the snarky main character, and the simpler combat. Problem is, where the original game shined (in story and in characters), this game fell flat on its face. The environments are so bland and same-y, the story is completely flat, and the moments where the prince's snide nature comes out are just too few and far between. Even the combat starts to feel a bit wonky and boring. Where the game really shines is in the puzzles. Swiftly leaping between traps, timing your jumps just right, was a lot of fun, especially when you get really neat special powers like the ability to stop water mid-air for some fascinating puzzles.I'll be honest though, it took me a couple times of dropping the game and coming back to it to finish it, but it got fun half-way through.=== The good ===+ Great parkour-styled puzzles+ They brought back the original Sands of Time voice actor!+ They did come up with a couple of neat settings for you solve your way through.+ Certain special powers, like the ability to stop water mid-air, was really fun. === The bad === - Flat, uninteresting characters.- Bland, one-note story.- Boring music.- The combat is snore-tastic and grindy.- Very little replay value.- The environments hardly make any sense at certain points.Bottom Line If you're bored and want a Prince of Persia game to turn your brain off and play, this'll do it for you. Just be prepared to turn your brain back on half way through the game once the devs started trying.			"

												I have been a prince of persia fan for a long time and I've played every one of them, I would say it is one of my favorite game series of all time. I was one of the people who was disappointed with the  PoP game made in 2008, the cell shaded styled one . I enjoyed it for what it was but I felt it was a move in the wrong direction. I liked the beautiful art design but it really was just too easy.As for this game, considering it was made in 2010 the graphics were very well done. The prince and his surroundings are very detailed and everywhere you look there has been a great attention to creating a beautiful world to enjoy. From the wisps of sand moving below a swinging trap, the great use of light peering through cracks or the fine details on clothing and armor. Everything looks great. Including the newly designed prince. PoP games have always had great graphics and this game continues that tradition.As for the game play, I think it is great how the designers have added the control of elements, like water, into the great gameplay that we saw in the previous games. It really adds a welcome new twist to the action/puzzle solving style this game series has always done so well.I see alot of people knocking the combat, well for me I love it. I like that I can charge my attacks, I like that I can kick enemies down and I really like the addition of finishing moves that are stylish and enjoyable to pull off. Quite simply this is the best combat engine ever use in a PoP game. As for it being easy, well I think it just makes you feel more powerful and I for one enjoy the fact that its not frustrating. It keeps the game moving along and that is something I prefer over games that have overly difficult combat (ex : Ninja Gaiden, Dark Souls) I think it was done purposely because the game was meant to be enjoyed by more than just hardcore gamers.One thing that makes the combat seem easy is the addition of powers that you unlock with experience points. Like an RPG you can spend these points anyway you see fit to give you special abilities like stoneskin or allow you to knockdown all surrounding enemies with a wind based attack. Again I find these abilities a welcome addition to the game and I like the carrot being dangled knowing that I have more and more powerful ones to unlock as I progress through the game.As for the sound I think this was well done, just like everything else in the game. From the voice acting to that music to the background sounds everything works well and never distracts for the experience. Which for me is what good sound design is.I can't help but wonder what it is that gamers and reviewers who knock this game want from their games. This game is polished and fine tuned. It looks great and plays great. It has everything we loved about the past games while injecting some fresh new ideas into the mix. It gives you more of everything. More enemies, more abilities, more combat choice with finishers, new puzzles that use traps and timing as well as the new addition of elements like turning water solid. I think people look for the smallest imperfections when they should be enjoying what is so good in the game.Sure the camera can occasionally be out of place, but what game like this has a perfect camera ? Actually I haven't experienced any real problem with it so far anyway. It has a snap behind button and rotation control, so whats the problem ?Prince of Persia Forgotten Sands is an excellent game and in my opinion the best in the series. It has a great balance of action, combat and puzzle solving all set in a beautiful world and for me thats all I wanted and the team at ubisoft delivered in this latest PoP adventure.			"

												Cliché if there ever was one. From the very start you see what will happen and if you think there is some major twist in the game that would make you go WOW, you're wrong. Characters are blander than water. No humour, no stoy, no smart comments, I swear it would be more interesting if every character would just stay silent. Also, with Ubisoft you'd expect some wonderful graphics at least. Well, I feel like the Sands of Time had better graphics. If I don't even mention PoP 2008 or what it was which was work of art in the graphics department. The prince is yellow, his liver must be failing big-time. Painfuly blue eyes, that can't be good for the retina in such sun. And muscles are showing as if there were no skin whatsoever. First thing the tutorial tells you that you can move your camera as much as you want in a very easy way. A first lie too, coz most of the jumps and whatnot are from forced perspective. Only fights are actual move-as-you-wish and not all at that.The game is short, so linear it's painful. Puzzles ... there are no puzzles, for each room the game camera pans up, following the path you have to take to get through. The fights are swarm, which is very popular, but when you have maybe 2 combos and they all consist of clicking the mouse's left button it gets kinda old very fast.The biggest challenge in the game is pressing SHIFT R-Mouse-button and ALT at the right times. And even that is not a challenge. In about 5min your hand starts working on reflex and it's right 95% of the time.Some things are worth suffering Uplay for ... this is most definitely NOT one of them.			"
