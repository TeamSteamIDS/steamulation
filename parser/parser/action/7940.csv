												This is the one that started it all.Depending on your opinion, this can either be a good or a bad thing.Before things got stupid...before we got Elysium exo-suits....before we had smart dogs...before we had Zombies....before this franchinse became synomous with ""Adding another number/title to it""...we had this.Still mindless run and gun and still incredibly overdramatic.  The spirit of Michael Bay is alive and well within this franchise even at this early stage.  However, the first foray out of World War II for the series was a refreshing breath of air at the time and the original still holds up very well.All Ghillied Up is still one of the greatest levels in ALL of Call of Duty.

												My Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Review.Ok, so I have played A LOT of this game so i feel that i'm justified in saying that this game is FANTASTIC. In this review i will go through the pros and cons of purchasing this game. I am trying to come from a perspective of someone who has played this game since 2008, I have purchased this game 4 times, for Xbox 360, PS3, Retail Box and Steam. Over the 4 versions of the game I would say that I have played a good 1000 hours. Yet I keep coming back for some reason. Cod4 is one of the games that I play each and every day. I mostly play Promod, but I dip into Non-modded every now and then.Pros:Mod Support, many, many mods for this game. There is a whole separate game of just mods. To name a few there is Prop Hunt, Promod, One in the chamber and a multitude of others. Smooth uninterrupted game play, I wish more games had this these days. From the ground up this game was made to be as smooth as possible.Developer Console, this is a biggy in my books. Not enough games these days have this. This is the command line that you can use to edit any settings that you would like, you can load maps, change Sensitivity aswell as other settings such as FOV and maxfps. With commands like cg_fov 80 and com_maxfps 250.Cons:There are very few cons for this game. Some of the biggest and most prevalent are the aim botters and silent aim users. If anything this is what will send you over the edge. Another thing is that most of the servers are unpopulated. Don’t get me wrong, there is still a huge player base in CoD4. Its just that I wish there were more.Thank you for reading this review and I hope that it will influence your purchase in a good way. Cheers, Virconium			"

												One of the best games of the franchise, the highly acclaimed Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is a must have for a fan of the Call of Duty games. The games single player experience is phenomonal. From the beginning raid on the Russian tanker, to the cataclysmic end to the U.S campaign, to the brilliant All Ghillied Up mission, the game will keep you hooked, followed by a story that is believable, but not over the top compared to the future releases in the franchise.The Multiplayer is where Call of Duty shines however, and Cod 4 is a thoroughly enjoyable experience but not without flaws due to a variety of reasons at this point in time. When Cod 4 was released, the game included many new features not seen in previous Call of Duty games, such as the now standard Create a Class, Killstreaks etc, all of which feel balanced and nothing too overpowered (except maybe the P90). Where the PC version differs to the console versions is the player count. Cod 4 supports up to 48 players per server and sometimes it's absolute madness, just like the old Call of Duty days. Make no mistake, it's still a really enjoyable experience but console players may find it somewhat jarring coming from console to PC but you can always join a server with less players. There is no Prestige, with ranks taking longer to achieve in its place, and dedicated servers are there which mean less lag compared to the console version.BUT unfortunately, as 2013, Cod 4's server browser and online experience is somewhat annoying. A LOT of servers which turn up in the browser have this annoying redirect mod, which you have to install. This means what may show up as Backlot, standard, TDM, 40 players may redirect you to a Hardcore, S&D, 3 player game. It's frustrating at times to find a decent game. All in all, the game is highly recommended and along with the original Cod, UO and Cod 2. Probably the last GREAT Cod, with future games removing much of the standard PC features and instead being a console port. Buy it.			"

												This game is one of the best examples of why newer isn't always BETTER. COD 4 (Steam) is now one of the best games I own as there are loads of community made servers so you do not have to depend on Activision keeping them up. The gameplay is great and there are now servers with some of our favourite gamemodes like DeathRun, Prop Hunt etc, alongside the classic Call Of Duty maps. Although this game isn't the same price as it's console versions, it's a different, better game entirely. I totally recommend COD 4 for Steam, and would rate it a 9/10.			"

												A Solid Call of Duty title, the first game to become the more fast paced, twitch shooter, 360 no scope, games we know and love today.In all Seriousness, the pc version of this game is great not only because of modding but because of custom servers, free mod tools and a whole bunch more.The campaign is pretty good, the multiplayer though is where its at, And i would recommend playing the star wars mod for this game cause its star wars fever currently. The current playerbase isnt that high, but still higher than ghosts or aw which is fairly sad. At least theres no micro transactions in this game or any 15$ map packs. Everything is included for the 20€. But, at its current sale price of 9.99€, its defnitely worth picking up even just for the crazy fun star wars mod.			"

												Simply the best call of duty. And one of my favorite video games of all time. I think many will agree with me on that. i have less than 100 hours simply since i have nobody to play online with,and that i played the ♥♥♥♥ out of it on ps3 and nintendo wii. and then spent even more hours making montages i would fail at.One of the best single players mode out there,with a neat arcade mode and cheats to use. so it has a lot more replayablity compared most other cods(espeically more recent ones).But the mutiplayer is what really makes this game and thankfully there is plently of servers still online on PC(including fun mod ones). so the game may be dead on consoles,but on PC its worth playing. Also joining a match is pretty quick, almost instant so if you want instant action,well there you go.The gameplay style is more simple,but with enough perks and attachments to keep it from being boring,and i think it all comes down to weapon balance and pretty much every weapon in this game is useful. you can do well with almost any weapon.So yeah the only negative is the price,its pretty fixed at 20 bucks and sales are extrememly rare,and thats coming from someone who spent hundreds of hours on. just be aware the community is much smaller and finding a decent server will take some trial and error.9/10 its like skyrim but with modern warfare			"

												Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is the series at its Finest Hour.Back in 2007, it was a big year for video games, on PC we got Orange Box, Crysis, Bioshock,etc, console players had Halo 3, AC and Mass Effect, even among those big titles, Call of Duty 4 stood out. Its predecessors, namely Call of Duty and CoD2, were already highly successful, but CoD4 was simply beyond most gamers' expectation. I still remember playing this on my roommate's PC and got totally blown away by the ""One shot, one kill"" mission.Singleplayer Story: 9/10The story is straight forward, it is not a role-playing game where you made choices, or a Hollywood movie with lots of twists, you simply move with your squad, and shoot bad guys. However, the developer still manages to put the action pieces together with a nice story, it is not perfect, but can still give you the good old ""Saving Private Ryan"" feeling (like it was in MOHAA). In comparsion, MW2's story tries to give you ""WOW"" moments, like a Michael Bay movie with lots of cool actions, but fails to deliver the glorious feel.Presentation: 9.5/10The presentation is top notch in 2007, some moments are still amazing to this day, like the mission ""All Ghillied Up"" is an instant classic, where you crawled through emeny fields in a ghillied suit, with heavy tanks and patrols moving by, it is one of the most thrilling experiences in FPS history. The graphics are surely out-dated, but they aged elegantly. The gun models, animations and battlefield atomsphere are impeccable even in today's standards, which create great immersion. The pacing of shooting scene/intermission is perfect. There are also lots of explosions, but none feels out of place. Music: 9/10The in-game music composed by Harry Gregson-Williams suits the pace and atomsphere perfectly, whether it is the middle-eastern showdown, or the desolate pripyat city, or the ICBM lauch field, the music always bring the scene to life. It may not surpass the later MW2's music by Hans Zimmer Team, but still excellent game soundtrack.Multiplayer: 9.5/10The MP mechanics was a revolution back in 2007, very fun and addictive even to this day. Most MP maps (aside from a few tiny maps) are well crafted to hold as much as 40-50 players, while still very fun to play with low player counts(8-16), also keep in mind that In later CoD (MW2 above) the player count is capped at 18, which, in my opinion, completely lost the epic battlefield feeling. This game also came before the crappy IWNet ever existed thus supports dedicated server, you can easily find a populated server with playable ping, without the worries about host-migration or host abuse, etc.The weapons are balanced and diversified, not only feel great but actually have recoil(unlike those ""laser guns"" in later CoDs). The good old 3-5-7 killstreaks are simple and effective, as well as satisfying, you won't get ridiculous powerful killstreak (like nuke or AC-130 in later CoDs) but the result is still very rewarding.End of the lineCall of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is the prime CoD experience on PC. With so many blockbuster shooters flooding the market today, you may want to pay this old game a revisit, and see what we gamers have missed all those past years.Edit: My steam profile suggests less than 1 hour CoD4 gameplay, which is not true. My in-game stats shows I played online for more than 500 hrs, coupled with another 300-400 hrs spent playing on mods, my total play time is nearly 1000 hrs. The reason is that I used Steam key on a retail copy to avoid Steam overlay/Punkbuster incompabilites. If you don't mind losing steam overlay, I suggest you do the same, the online gameplay will be much smoother.			"

												After 7 years, this game is still awesome. The story is just absolutely amazing.Multiplayer was the best part of the game, back in the Xbox 360 days basic Team Deathmatch, Search and Destroy and 1v1 level boosting lobbies.For me this was better than MW2, after MW2 the COD franchise was starting to die. Would look forward to Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Remastered.Multiplayer was more fun back in Call of Duty 4's days, you could have actual strategies in it.And of course how can you forget Campaign mission in Chernobyl, game wouldn't be like this if it wasn't included.(My hours are low, because I completed only the story on PC, basically reviewing Xbox 360's version Multiplayer.)9.0/10			"

												The last good Call of Duty.I can remember back in 2007 when I bought this game for the XBOX 360. It is by far the best Modern Warfare game of the series.Singleplayer starts the whole MW storyline, you play as ""Soap"", a soldier that just joined the SAS, and Jackson, an U.S. Marine.You never see their faces neither they talk during the campaign, which makes it much more easy to take the role of these characters. Gampeplay in SP is rather linear, as such I'm not a very big fan of it. However, from a storyline standpoint I really like it, and in my opinion it should have ended with CoD4.Multiplayer is the core of this game. It is by far the best multiplayer experience the whole series has to offer. Gameplay is much more balanced than in the other MW games, Mod support included, great weapon choices.Call of Duty died for me after this game.			"

MP: Way more minimalism as the ""newer"" titles. But still better. The mod and map community is still developing/modding stuff for MW1. (Check out Galactic Warfare, btw - it's a fully modded MW in the Star Wars universe). All in all, the game looks and feels still gorgeous . 10/10			"

												+Gunplay feels fresh and up to date. +Still thousands of active players and servers+No nuke, choppergunner, gamekilling streaks. Simple UAV, Air(fail)strike and Attack copter+10-40+ player servers+Mods+Atmospheric and interesting campaign.-No co-op. So, 7 years after release, i decided to buy the game again. This time on Steam...obviously.And guess what ? It still stands its ground. People saying that it's the best CoD game in the franchise are not full of shait or blinded by nostalgia.I first started up the singleplayer campaign. Finished the boat mission and when the text, ""Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare"", appeared after the end of the first mission, i got chills. Really. It felt just like the first time i ever played the game.And it isn't the nostalgia talking. It was like a new experience...only re-lived.The music, the atmosphere...everything in here is so well done. Atmosphere...a little sense of realism and characteristics...these are something that are missing in the latest CoD games.Since Black Ops 1 it has been just about explosions and over-the-top action. I love explosions...and i love the silly, uber-soldier action...but CoD went too far with it. You don't feel close to the characters anymore. You don't get sucked into the stories or into the world...no. It's just nonesense action. The characters in Blops games or Ghosts, they don't feel like soldiers anymore. Hell, they are not soldiers. They are superheroes. When i play a CoD game i want a game with soldiers, not a Marvel movie directed by Michael Bay...it's like Marvel Transformers...ugghhh...The campaigns in CoD4 and MW2 are the only good campaigns in the new era of CoD. Old era (CoD 1-3) is ofc good aswell, but the gameplay in the latest CoDs is just way better.EDIT: OK, WaW campaign is quite decent aswell and i did enjoy Blops2 campaign 'cus it tried to be fresh and innovative but the story and characters were still just ""MEH!"".Now the multiplayer. This is where CoD4 shines. This is where the roosters at! It still holds up.I expected a dated character movement and gunplay but i was dead wrong. The gunplay is amazing! The gunplay is, in fact, better than in Blops or MW3.Sure, the character movement is a bit smoother in, say...Blops2. But everything else is better in here.Yes, the multiplayer is still alive! Hundreds, if not thousands, of servers full of people! There are 8vs8 servers, 12vs12, 16vs16, 20vs20 even!Latest CoDs only have 8vs8 and that's about it...maybe 12vs12 max but not more. CoD4 is the only CoD where you see 40 people in one server.It also has one of the best multiplayer maps. MW2 had some really cool maps too and Blops2 had couple of decent maps (Nuketown and Hijacked) but CoD4 takes the cake! Pretty much every map is a masterpiece in here!CoD4: Modern Warfare is a must have for every FPS fan!			"

												10/10 Both Single Player and Multiplayer are functional on Windows 10 OUT OF THE BOX.I just want to confirm this for people wondering if this game is still alive. It totally is! Even after a decade, there are a TONNE of servers active with many players still playing on them. You dont need to download any mods or patches to make it work, nor do you need to even touch punkbuster. Not every single server will work because some require maps/files you may not have, but upon failing to connect, they usually give you a link to the site you can get them from. As for vanilla maps / gamemodes, this totally works!! No CD key ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, just select a server and connect! Leveling up your rank also functions just fine. In a single 30min TDM i ranked up a couple times so im not entirely sure if it was always that fast or if the server had boosted rates but it hardly matters as your rank is linked to a file on your PC. If you so choose, you can download a MP profile that has everything unlocked, or just enjoy ranking normally. If you know how, you can also port forward and host a live or dedicated server for you and friends right from the game's multiplayer menu. You can even make it public (show up on server browser) for others to join.As for the single player aspect. It's one of the best of the series (story and gameplay wise). I've played Counterstrike for multiple years and often refused to get sunked into a CoD game despite trying many of them due to their weak 'feel good' style of gameplay katered towards a smaller skill gap however CoD4 has been the only exception for me, putting hundreds of hours on Xbox 360 souly for this game many years back. I've run through the story at least 5 times and enjoyed it every time since. It's dramatic, slightly cheesy at times but overall told very well and have solid characters you surely will get attached to. The system req's are quite low as well so nearly any PC from 06 with a 128mb GPU and Pentium 4 will be able to run this game at a solid 60. I'd strongly reccomend this game considering the community is still very much active. Even when the master server goes down, many 3rd party websites offer lists of live IP's you can directly connect to without the use of the server browser. $10 is totally worth it, I couldn't be happier.

												Modern Warfare was a turning point for gaming. It was innovative, different and overall a really great game. This is a game worth playing, and a turning point for Call of Duty and the wholle videogame market. A turn for the worse that is, with the anual , recycled releases and saturated genre... But Modern Warfare is worth playing. If you ever wanted to try a CoD game, make sure it's this one.			"

												If you are reading this, buy it now. Activision must be realizing how much it is screwing up the Remastered version. First by chaining it to Infinite Warfare, then adding supply drops, now it's charging money for the DLC. Who charges money for a REMASTERED game? Every game that is remastered and re-released has the DLC bundled in for free.Plus Remastered is unmoddable. No server browser either.Coming back to the original CoD 4, it felt like a breath of fresh air. You can do whatever you want to do with it. And guess what, not only do you get to play the Variety pack for free, but also maps from MW2 and MW3 on certain servers. Let that sink in.All computers today (even those with Intel Graphics) can play this, so none of you have an excuse.			"

												First I have to say I have played COD4 alot on Xbox360, getting all the achievements and playing the Campaign over and over again.CoD on PC:-CoD2 :         Super active (Ty @Lyme)-CoD4 MW:   VERY active -CoD WaW:   Quite active-CoD MW2:    Active-CoD BO :      Active-CoD MW3:   Active -CoD BOII :    Active-CoD Ghosts: DEAD -CoD AW:       DEAD-CoD BOIII :   Active-CoD IW : In the trashcan because everyone plays CoD4 Remastered ^^#RipCoD? maybe not, but some quality has been dropping for some time even though I enjoy some of the new titles.Game Review:CoD4 is a great game, however it is not bug free or without its problems. The core gameplay, like beating the campaign & epiologue on veteran, or replaying the gun course to  beat the dev time for the bazillionth time is alot of fun. The MP experience is after all this time pretty decent too. Thanks to good maps, dedicated servers and fast paced action without too much customization.Now 9 Years later I still enjoy this game that blew my mind back in the day, before season passes and mini DLC's brought the full prices to over 120€....  8/10			"

I was one of the people who just hated people playing COD and calling them a nub. The game was on sale so I bought it as I was curious why people say that COD:MW is good. My god, I started campaign, I was in love already. I loved the story, the characters were very interesting as well. Everything is just amazing.

 Call of Duty® 4: Modern Warfare® it's still one game good of series Call of Duty Modern Warfare! It's a Good gen first-person shooter developed by the company Infinity Ward and published by Activision Company. I really like this game because the story beginssomewhere in the near future where there is a civil war involving countries US, UK, and Russia against Russian ultranationalists and rebels in a small country in Middle East.  The story was very successful and also the characters and action!  Levels are:  Prologue  F.N.G.  Crew Expendable  The Coup   Act I  Blackout   Charlie Do not Surf  The Bog  Hunted   Death From Above  War Pig  Shock and Awe   Aftermath  Act II  Safehouse  All Ghillied Up  One Shot, One Kill  Heat  The Sins of the Father  Act III  Ultimatum  All In  No Fighting In The War Room  Game Over  Epilogue  Mile High Club - Bonus mission that takes place on a plane hijacked by terrorists.  Multiplayer  After completion singleplayer campaign will be released an arcade game that prolongs life by enabling replay missions based on points awarded on various criteria, from how many enemies are killed by the time the mission ends.  Are available at Multiplayer several ways like as: Free-for-all | Team deathmatch | Search & Destroy | Domination | Headquarters |  Also you can custom your Class. The multiplayer it's good, have nice maps and it's fun to play with your friends :D  My rating about Call of Duty® 4: Modern Warfare® |  • Story: 9/10  • Graphics: 8.50/10  • Sound: 8/10  I Recommend this Call of Duty because it's a good game of series Modern Warfare :) The Story it's nice and full of action. The Multiplayer it's also good and is fun to play with friends. Graphics is pretty good and also the sound ;)  By:#CRISTIAN1ELITE  "

												The game that started and made the Modern Warfare franchise famous. I believe the record sales were not produced by this but by its sequel, still, it is the first MW game that took the CoD franchise from the WW II era to a modern setting.It is one of those FPS games that still had a very entertaining and relatively long campaign. MW's single player story takes us to places such as the Ukraine, Western-Europe and even the Middle-East. There are some surprises and the campaign ends in a climax.The richness of the game's multiplayer content and its longevity should not be mentioned. It is, after all, a Call of Duty game.As for purchasing it nowadays? I do not really know... it is very expensive considering it is a 7-year old game. Also, a warning for those of you who wishes to make a purchase: Punkbuster support seems to be discontinued and this is a must to play the game's multiplayer mode otherwise players get kicked out of servers. I believe there are some workarounds you can find on the internet.			"

												Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare is one of the most influential games of the modern era. It almost single handedly paved the way towards modern military shooters becoming a trend. Gone were the days of countless World War 2, Vietnam and space shooters. Now was the relatively untapped potential of modern day shooters.Prior to Modern Warfare, modern military shooters were usually akin to sims. Games like Rainbow Six or Full Spectrum Warrior are good examples. Very tactically complex games with little run and gun action. Modern Warfare replaces run and gun with stop and pop. You use cover to your advantage and duck out with iron sights. Call of Duty 4 is the game I see as popularizing iron sights and probably utilized them the best compared to other games at the time. Moving and firing from the hip is wildly inaccurate but holding your sights down would increase your accuracy dramatically but slow your movement and narrow your field of view. It's an extremely immersive mechanic and one that was designed to compensate for the limited accuracy of analog sticks.That's not all that Modern Warfare gave us either. Modern Warfare also paved the way for progression based multiplayer. Contrary to arena shooters, Modern Warfare instead focuses on letting you customize your arsenal with sights, scopes, underbarrel grenade launchers and even color schemes. And you unlock all of this gradually the more you play. It feels akin to an RPG where the more you play, the cooler your guns become and the more efficient you are at taking other players down. This is still the dominant system in first person shooters and even more popular franchises like Halo and Doom started to use it. And lastly the singleplayer in Modern Warfare is fairly good. It is a mostly scripted and linear shooter with plenty of good set pieces and moments. Along with prior staples of the series like having multiple protagonists and viewpoints across the story. One other thing to note is how much of a PC game Modern Warfare 1 was compared to it's sequels. It has a console, a full SDK and map editor, dedicated servers and so much more. It allowed for things like bots to be added. And even close to 10 years after release you can still find enough people who want to play this game to fill a server. As derivative as later titles in this series got, you have to admire a charismatic and influential game like Modern Warfare. Very few first person shooters have such a lasting legacy that stands the test of time.			"

												The Call of Duty series has long been set in the theatre of World War II. The fourth instalment seeks to change this and alter the formula by taking place in modern times, where the good and bad guys are harder to define, the weapons are more powerful, and the plot is more complicated than just pushing back the Third Reich. The result is a game that is fun to play, whether alone or with others, and that sets a new benchmark for FPS games.The game is neatly divided into two parts: single player, and multiplayer, with more than just human opponents differentiating the two modes. The single player charts the progress of the United States Marine Corps and the Special Air Services, the British equivalent, via a combatant in each. The story is short, and at a comfortable difficulty level, should take no more than half a dozen hours or so. But that's not to say it's lacking in content - on the contrary, the single player experience is intense and filled with memorable sequences and scenes. It's definitely worth playing through at least once.The AI in the single player game is done quite well, for both the enemies and your teammates. Your teammates will stay behind cover, poking their head out to fire at the enemies, toss grenades, follow behind you when you proceed, and in general do a good job of being teammates. A little bit more fire from them would've been appreciated, though. The enemy does the same thing, hiding from your shots and tossing grenades, but they do it a little too well.The enemy's AI, especially on the higher difficulties, borders on the ludicrous side of unfair, as they'll be able to do amazing tasks that even the best sniper couldn't. Throwing grenades a hundred feet with perfect accuracy, taking you out with three shots from an AK-47 while completely out of your view (even with a sniper rifle's scope), and even firing on you the instant you turn corners, as if they already knew you were coming. At some points, it's possible to be aiming at a doorway with a raised rifle for the enemy to appear, only to have them come through, raise their weapon, fire a couple shots, and kill you immediately, all before you could even fire once. There's a difference between a fair difficulty and a frustrating one, and COD4 definitely tends to the latter.Buying this game for the single player experience alone, however, would mean you were missing out on the bulk of the content. The multiplayer of Call of Duty 4 holds an inordinate amount of fun in it, introducing new elements and ideas that make it fresh, fun, and worth replaying again and again.The multiplayer has a variety of modes for you to play through. There's the standard deathmatch and team deathmatch, where in the PC version, entering a game with nearly fifty players can mean staying alive for half a dozen seconds before someone finds you and shoots you. Other modes include Headquarters, where two opposing teams must capture a single point on the map (the HQ) and hold it for as long as they can to rack up points. In Sabotage, your team must find a bomb and use it to blow apart a target. On their own, the multiplayer modes are pretty fun, but they're nothing really new.The Class system of COD4 is the first thing that adds some variety into the mix. Initially, you get to select one of a few pre-made classes, each with a specific primary weapon, secondary weapon, attachments and delightful little enhancements called 'perks'. These perks further flesh out your character by allowing him to do such things as hold extra grenades, take more damage, and sprint for longer distances. At first, there's not a whole lot unlocked: the weapons are mediocre, the perks average at best, and there isn't too much variety. But that's not all…Where the game really gets interesting is the ability to earn experience points as you complete objectives and defeat other players. Earn enough experience and you'll move up in rank, which means unlocking features, weapons, attachments, classes, perks, and challenges. The real point of interest is unlocking the Create-a-Class feature, which allows you to invent your own class with its own weapons, perks, and so forth. As more perks and better weapons get unlocked, you'll find yourself not so helpless anymore, as your jerky, one-shot sniper rifle is replaced by a semi-automatic, your dusty handgun is replaced by a desert eagle, and your perks include such interesting abilities as the chance to take out your handgun as you lay dying and fire a few final shots at your killer, or dropping a live grenade when you die.Challenges add yet another reason to play multiplayer. As your increase your rank, you'll unlock challenges for each weapon that, upon completion, grant you attachments and extras for that particular weapon. Additionally, there are challenges that don't involve specific tools, such as leaping and falling to your death, killing a certain number of enemies while crouching/prone, or shooting down a helicopter.Overall, the multiplayer experience of Call of Duty 4 is astounding, and probably worth the price of the game by itself, as long as you don't mind playing with others. A big issue with it, however, seems to be that once you reach level 55 on the PC version, you can't proceed any further and that somewhat tempers the experience as a whole. Other than this, however, the multiplayer portion as a whole is very well done.Call of Duty 4 is an excellent game, there's really no doubt about it. Top-notch presentation combined with tight gameplay and impressive graphics make it fun to play on the single-player, but it's in the multiplayer aspect of the game that the experience is the best. As far as first-person shooters go, this is one of the best on the market, and is something anyone that's sure to interest anyone who has dabbled in the genre.			"

												Definately one of the or the best Call of Duty games in the franchise. Solid gameplay and originality. I started on this, past World at War they have started to go downhill. If you're considering getting any Call of Duty game, play this, World at War and Modern Warfare 2. Multiplayer is still kicking but you're out of luck if you want any dedicated servers or servers without any scripts or modifications installed. However, I found found a handful of servers which aren't overboard with scripting which I play on. Another thing that should be pointed out about multiplayer is that most servers have XP raises so don't expect slow or legitimate leveling times. If you want this, just wait until the remaster arrives so there will be dedicated servers.Campaign is fantastic aswell. Story is written well and is consistant throughout. Definately worth a buy for FPS lovers.			"

												This is the first modern warfare game of thought many mistakens it as the 4th modern warfare game , wow thinking that it has been release for over 8 years already,but time doesnt change the good amount of content call of duty 4 has to offer / story wise and extended multiplayer content.Remember back then we get free map contents without having to pay for it , yeah its all here. The overall gameplay is proven superior to other next gen cod game as has a way interesting story line     and multiplayer experience any cod has to offer . The graphics might be outdated a bit but its still the best .

												The game that started it all.No, this game was and IS great. No dubstep and autism here. This was when companies were trying to make the most out of the new technology they were given. Call of Duty still had that goosebump inducing storyline, it was practically the only campaign worth replaying. This game in particular gives you a single player experience that you will remember forever. If you haven't played it, stop reading and go play it NOW, you're no good to humanity alive.The excitment didn't just stop at the single player of course. You can NEVER leave out the multiplayer that set the standard for first person shooters for years to come. Though the multiplayer has been long outvalued by the current Call of Duty games, this is where it started. For those of you just joining the franchise, it's comments like ""this game sucks"", ""the graphics are terrible"", ""mechanics are clunky"" that make you look like a fool. For those of us that have been playing Call of Duty from the very start, this game was the best on the market for us. It's insulting when people like you come around and try to criticize it. You can't and won't understand how great of a game this was for us.If you play the single player, this game holds it's value at 20 dollars. Don't expect much from multiplayer these days though. "

												Hello guy's.This is my first review of all time so dont except to much from this. ( I'll try to give my best )A little thing to say : I'll just review the Multiplayer part.First of all -> How did i get my first contact with this game?I started playing CoD 4 back in 2010 ~ i was in school and my friends told me its a great game to play.So i started and getting addicted from this game. It's not all about the graphic. I like the nostalgic gameplay without the new things ( They're great but nothing for me ), with the similar killstreak's and mods.PRO'S ~-> A lot of tactic gameplay-> Many mod's ( CoD Jumper, zombie, hide 'n seek ecc. )-> A lot of funny bugs / exploits ( Every elevator )-> Bouncing ( ! )-> Similar killstreaks-> No OP Weapon's-> Great maps with a lot of nice callouts-> Not that many cheater-> Great wallbang CON'S ~-> A ""lot"" of redirect / bot server-> It's not that much played anymore-> 'Roccat' ( :( )For the end ~I just can say it is an awesome game and everyone who loves CoD should have playd this game.

												Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is the first game of the series to break away from the tried and true World War 2 setting and into the new era of war, involving constant risks of nuclear annihilation and smaller scale, urban combat. Russia has fallen into civil war as Ultra-nationalists attempt to resurrect the Soviet Union, meanwhile an unnamed Middle Eastern country has been overthrown by a warlord with ties to said Ultra-Nationalists. We play as two main characters, one a US Marine called Paul Jackson and a British SAS Sergeant named John “Soap” MacTavish. Starting off we play as Soap who has just been accepted into a SAS squad led by series’ famous and mustached hero, John Price.You are tasked with completing some quick practice training before being briefed on your mission to familiarize you with the game. If you have played any Call of Duty game or any FPS in general over the past decade you will have no issues getting the hang of it. Introduced in this tutorial is the new feature of flash grenades designed to disorient enemies caught in its blast. Mastering these will greatly improve your chances of survival since you will now be fighting in small areas instead of the vast battlefields of WW2 and a well-placed throw can decide the outcome. By far my favorite edition is that bullets can now pass through thin objects which makes it a ton of fun as bullets penetrate all your surroundings, causing you to desperately seek cover behind something sensible.It works the other way around as well so no longer will enemies by able to use a tiny fence as indestructible cover. With that new found knowledge found in your training you are then briefed on your mission to retrieve an object from a well-guarded enemy cargo ship. It is here that you realize that the CoD series has taken a new feel to it. While previous games were more down to earth and grim with the sight of allies being killed being common place, Modern Warfare goes the Michael Bay route with tons of explosions, escaping a flooding cargo ship and jumping into the helicopter at the very last second. It's not a criticism nor a necessarily bad thing but it's a change of tone I felt was worth mentioning.The journey of playing both US and British forces take you all over Russia and the Middle East, both stories are interconnected and give you a greater view of the story instead of being there for convenient teleportation to another cool location. You play as a few other unnamed soldiers, pilots and even John Price for a bit though those are over very quickly and are just keep the game from getting stale by changing up the gameplay such as you having to provided air support and carefully shooting your missiles. Most of these extra characters feel gimmicky and are not really all that fun except for when you play as Price in Chernobyl, on an important stealth mission. That was easily the high point of the game and a moment I will remember long after I stop playing. And that is saying something as there are many high points when playing as the main protagonists.Aside from bullet penetration, the gameplay is the same as previous entries only now you have newer weaponry, gadgets and gun attachments such as a grenade launcher added under your assault rifle. Smoke grenades are back and as useful as ever to pass through heavy fire or be concealed from tanks and such. Another new addition that is extremely gimmicky and neigh on useless are the night vision goggles. You could see just fine without them and don't really serve any purpose other than a bullet point on the new features list. You're never in a position where you have to scavenge for items or ammo, they are refilled after every mission or taken away, you will always have what you need which makes sense considering these elite soldiers won't go in unprepared but feels too “hand holdy” gameplay wise.Especially when it comes to ammo. You are given an obscene amount and I have never once had to switch weapons or take an enemies weapon. That was one change to the series I did not like as you will not use any of the other weapons in the game unless you go out of your way to do so while playing through the campaign. Melee combat has been changed a bit as well, while the previous games had you use your weapons to smack an enemy, Modern Warfare has you automatically pull out a knife and lunge at him which I personally find much more satisfying. The smaller environments both harm and help Modern Warfare, on one hand it is far more obvious how linear the game is but on the other it makes it more in your face and fast paced than ever before.The campaign is short but sweet, it took me about 5 hours to fully complete though it went at break neck speedy action every step of the way and had a shockingly decent story. There is not much motivation to replay it though. 30 enemy laptops are scattered throughout the campaign and unlock cheat codes after finding enough of them yet the cheat codes are usually very underwhelming such as making your screen black and white or other pointless screen effects. The only cheat code that I've unlocked that was decent was the “Cluster grenade” which causes huge explosions once your grenades detonates. To try to motivate you to reply they also added an Arcade Mode once you finish the game that lets you replay any mission and earn points for everything you do. It offers nothing but racking up high scores and is nowhere near enough to get me to replay the campaign after just having finished it.Where the game really shined back in the day was in its multiplayer. It's RPG like progression system to unlock titles, weapons and perks was revolutionary and changed the FPS genre as a whole. For better or for worse is in the eye of the beholder. It introduced the problem that those who played longer have a significant advantage over newer players but on the other hand it is satisfying to be constantly rewarded with stuff for playing and helped differentiate each player. One may have a perk that allows them to run further without stopping, another may simply have more health and yet another player may be able to hip fire far more accurately and surprise you. It makes every firefight interesting since you never know just what tricks your foe has up his/her sleeve. Once you hit level 5 you can build up to five custom classes that will be useful for different situations and tons of fun to experiment with.Be warned though, the multiplayer will crash on start unless right click on your sound icon, go into your recording tab and then enable “Stereo Mix”. No clue as to why but that fixes the issue. Another issue is that if you are playing via Steam make sure to unbind the in-game screenshot key that defaults to F12 as that will also cause your game to crash if you take a screen-shot. Weird steps to make the multiplayer work but it is definitely still worth playing even after all these years and still has a decently sized community so finding a game won't be a problem (as of this review). In a rather cool move by Activision the 1 DLC pack released for Modern Warfare is already included. All in all, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was a breath of fresh air and finally broke the series free from it's done to death WW2 roots.			"

Infinity Ward, tired of doing the same old thing, stood up against the powers that be and shouted into the dark with all their burning indie spirit, ""ENOUGH!""

Never before had players been so deeply immersed in such a ferocious battlefield as this, and we've been hungry for more ever since.			"

												My playtime on steam does not do justice for this game. I bought it back when it came out on PC on Disc, pre-steam availbilty, and racked up hundreds of hours on the PC version. (Thousands on PS3). This game is definitely the starting point of Call of Duty, and the beginning of what was an amazing game franchise. The game is still pretty active, and there are a lot of modded servers still going such as Zombies, Star Wars etc. Definitely work picking it up if it's on deal, just bare in mind that they are releasing the Remaster of it at the end of 2016 with Infinite Warfare, and there may be a stand-alone remaster - so I'd suggest only purcasing this if it's quite cheap, as Activision have a tendency to be ♥♥♥♥ holes.Unlike all the newer COD games (Black Ops 1 onwards) this game comes with the DLC as well (as does World at War) so you'll never have to worry about not finding games, it also has the server browser which allows custom servers.Definitely a recommend.

												WARNING: This review contains spoiler. You have been warned .OK I dont know where to start. Im a veteran in CS for like 10+ years(?) and I was looking for a great gun blazing fps game with great story mode, and then I saw COD series were on sale, so I bought this for only 5 bucks I think. I chose this besides the newer series because they said this is the hardest of all of COD series.First intro scenes were cool and amusing. Then the main menu, after spending a good amount of time setting the video, sound, and control I was ready. Tutorial bla bla, classic, until that last tutorial. I finished and they recommended me to play in Regular difficulty, I was like ""WTF, I dont spend 10 years playing CS to play COD on Regular difficulty, Lets go veteran how hard would that be"" I totally regret this.It was ♥♥♥♥ing crazy, I was running when we got ambushed. 2 F**king shots then I laid down on the ground ""WTF SRSLY?!"". I repeat every mission for several times, got mad several times, rage quit several times. I must say, the Veteran is fun yet 'killing' you (pun intended) I have to come up with bunch of different strategies just to complete 1 objective. Lets skip to the end, everyone is dying, I saw one of my comrade got shot right in the ♥♥♥♥ing head when he was trying to get me to a cover, Gaz was shot dead in front of my eyes (I miss ur sexy voice Gaz), Capt Price dying, he passed the gun on his hand, I no scope the last 3 guys, credit.... it was fun until that last picture of Gaz, Capt Price, Griggs, and 1 other guy that I dont know who he is (or is he Soap?), I almost shed a tear ""it was only a short time, but why that left me with a huge sadness, it feels like I already knew them for years."" 1 ticket to feel train pls.In conclusion it is a BIG YES from me to buy this game, the story is great, Gaz with his sexy voice, hard difficulty is actually hard. 10/10 would 360 no scope a dog with an rpg again.

												Controls are easy to master. Graphics while showing their age come 2017 are serviceable. There's lots of replay value to be had from the multiplayer side of the game. Going up the ranks and earning new weapons, perks and gun camo is a lot of fun. Unlike the newer titles this game supports modding, as well as the inclusion of a server browser, which is sadly a big plus for a Call of Duty title these days.Would recommend this to any shooter fan.

												Call of Duty 4 was the second shooter I ever got into and was the game that really got me into PC gaming. I stil play this game for good reason. Along with one of the most memorable singleplayers I've ever played, this game has the back to the basics shooter feeling, with non of this new ""space-age"" Call of Duty crap. It feels genuine, and the setting, story, and characters all create a realistic feeling of combat throughout our world. The modding tools in this game is what gives its multiplayer the rare life it still has today, almost 10 years later after launch. This can't be sad for many games. Communities of great, humble people thrive on these servers. The people that play this game have stuck around, creating a mature and cleansed community, unlike the ""hip"" games of today, which are filled with people who move from title to title, spreading toxic rhetoric. This game is definitely a rarity in PC gaming: a developed and unique community, and brilliant execution of the game's mechanics and plot.			"

An Amazing GameI've played a lot of Call of Duty 4. Not just on Steam but on console as well. This game has provided me with many hours of enjoyment with my friends. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this game is still thriving almost 10 years after it was released.  It was quite refreshing to be able to play a good Call of Duty game with no exo jumps, supply drops, or microtransactions. This is what Call of Duty should be. A Surprisingly Healthy CommunityThis game is actually quite active, with a lot of servers. Different gamemodes, maps, and mods that make each experience different. The community is also quite mature and I experienced no 12 years old screaming at me about my mom. There are many different servers to accomadate many different playstyles, ranging from 24/7 Killhouse to a fairly tactical hardcore gamemode. Every server that I joined had a good amount of players in it that actually played the game and didn't flame at each other in chat. Mods This game has a substantial amount of mods that are very easy to install and can completely change the game. Whether you want a simple promod or the Galactic Warfare mod which completely changes the game to a Star Wars theme, it's all there. There are even a few mod menus out there that can be used to troll friends and whatnot (they can't be used online). Even though I haven't played very long on PC, I've already installed a few mods like Pezbot (which adds A.I. Bots for offline multiplayer) and the Galactic Wafare mod (which has no online servers that I've found unfortunately), as well as some custom maps. Installation is very easy and can be done in seconds. If you ever get bored of the core game, then mods are always an option. PROs and CONs+Thriving Community+Good performance+Mods+Mature playerbase+Nice maps+Rewarding Progression+Fun Gunplay and Weapons+No microtransactions or supply drops+Decent graphics for a game that's almost 10 years old+Very Good Campaign -Lack of Dedicated Private Match (which was available on console)-Lack of Prestige Mode (which was available on console)-Ping around 130-150 on many servers (I'm located in U.S.)Conclusion/TL;DRAlthough I haven't had a lot of hands-on time with the PC version, it's still brought back a lot of fond memories of the past. The PC verison feels very smooth and polished, and the community is very mature. The gameplay is what Call of Duty should be and the progression system feels very rewarding. The mods also provide a lot of enjoyment as well. Overall, I can see myself spending a lot of time playing this game. Overall Score 9.5/10 "

												Hello, So you like Call of Duty games, well look no further, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is the one you need.Here are some reasons:- you don`t need a strong PC to run it, but for more effects newer will always be better- more servers online, just pick the right ones- if you like zombie mod(s) there are plenty servers with no limitations (no DLCs)- small price compared to Back Ops seriesEven if your pocket is big, don`t think about buying something from Black Ops series unless you have at least 4 or more friends to play with.

												One of the best Call of Duty games ever released - this started a new era and the whole series are appraised by gamers and critics. The story is pretty interesting and takes place all over the world while playing as a British SAS Soap or US Marine Jackson. Personally I preferred the SAS missions because of the great characters, the professional team and more interesting missions. The US Marine missions are about war only where you are one of many and witness massive destruction around you. The most breathtaking missions include SPOILER the unforgetabble All ghillied up mission in Pripyat, UA where you play as a sniper with a task of assassination and the mission in the Middle East where you witness the Atomic bomb explosion from very close. END OF SPOILERAll in all, the modern graphics, action gameplay and breathtaking moments accompanied by dramatic music make this the best CoD game ever. The negative thing about it is the fact that it's multiplayer oriented and the singleplayer campaign, though totally awesome takes only 6 hours to finish, which is pretty embarassing.9/10			"

												One of the best Call of Duty games of all time. It is definitely worth the $20 price tag and is actually playable compared to the console versions of the game (same for WaW) When I was originally going to get this game for PC, I was skeptical whether or not MP would be dead, plagued with hackers, or no vanilla esc servers. Boy was I wrong. There are plenty of servers that are populated (20+ ppl per server) that use their own Anti-Cheat, so hackers are rare. If there is a hacker, they usually get banned from the server within 10 minutes by an admin. If you are also weary about not finding any Vanilla COD 4 servers don't worry either. There are several servers that run the game in its original state without mods installed. Don't get me wrong, mods are fun and almost always make games a much better experience, but its fun to go back and play the barebones version of the game. But seriously, if you have never played COD 4 before, BUY IT AND PLAY IT!			"

 Well finally, here is my review for CoD 4: Modern Warfare.  The game which revolutionized the franchise, adding excellent and unforgettable multiplayer maps, killstreaks, guns, etc. But first, let's talk about the campaign, is not a secret that it is kinda short, but it is one of the best campaigns in the story of FPS. Excellent dialogues, great escenarios, great characters and memorable soundtrack, this and more makes this game a well done shooter. Now, the multiplayer, which one is incredible fun, brings new things to the CoD franchise which ones totally change the way we used to see those games. Now we are in the modern warfare, so new weapons and technology. As I said at the beginning of this review, it has enjoyable maps, we have a selection of small and some ""big"" maps, all well done, the killstreaks are just great for this game. I can say more and more good things about this game.I used to play this game a lot a few years ago in the 360. Nowadays, the multiplayer maybe is not that great as it used to be. But don't worry, you can always find a lot of servers with people, there are still a lot of mods, etc. But yeah, my final words: If you for some reason don't have this game yet and you want to buy it, go and buy it, totally worth it.

												What can I say about this game that other people have not already said? One of the best in the franchise. The single player campaign is great and arcade mode also makes it fun. Multiplayer. It is well-balanced from perks to guns and has the set 3-5-7 killstreaks. Even better about the online multiplayer is that there are admins who watch servers for hackers so you don't have to worry about that problem! Though the game has some old graphics, nothing really matches up to it. Highly recommended.			"

												This review is way late considering this game came out when i was 12, but I am bored so let me explain why this is my favorite shooter of all time. I played on console since I was not PC master race at the time, so the playtime I have in this game, and the whole CoD series is something I would like to keep to myself...Anyways, this game marked the first cod to feature a perk system, and it is actually somewhat balanced! Yes I said it, balanced. Perks like last stand can seem annoying, but its very forgiving and has very fluid gameplay. If you are a fan of FPS/Comp. shooters.... then you will love CoD4. It will always have a special place in my gaming heart.After this game, in my opinion, the series has been on a constant downhill slump and this game will never be recreated or have a sequel that can compare to it 10/10			"

												Coming from a person who's not a fan of Infinity Ward at all, I gotta be real with you, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is amazing!Call of Duty 4 easily became my third favorite Call of Duty after only 2 hours of gameplay. I can now see why so many of my friends and other people around the world say how amazing Call of Duty 4 is. It's truly a masterpiece. Even though this is the only good game Infinity Ward has made, I still enjoy it a lot!The simplicity of the game, the classic killstreaks, the maps, the gun balance, the gamemodes, the dedicated servers, and the mods is what makes this game amazing. When people think of ""Classic CoD"" they immediately think of Call of Duty 4. While most Call of Duty's nowadays are full of broken game mechanics and poor PC optimization, CoD 4 is a nice breath of fresh air. Even though I didn't play this game back in it's prime in 2007, people are still playing and I can see why. Even haters of Call of Duty even admit that this is ""the only good CoD game"" and that's saying something to me!Even though this game lacks a friends list, co-op, and has somewhat of a low playercount, I can't recommend Call of Duty 4 enough. It's a fantastic game and definitely worth the twenty bucks.My rating 9/10			"

												Coming home to see my pops suprise me with  modern warfare the day after christmas was a breathtaking moment.  No choors or to do list just me and dooty, Plus my 90s soundtracks.  I couldent put  into words how excited I was. New gaming chairs, Mtn dew voltage, And Cool ranch doritos was all I needed to be happy. Girfreind you ask? Not a chance this was during free online days for ps3. I dident have the time to even text them back. Because I was to busy getting my kd just right, about 2000 more kills then deaths and upgrading my mp5k till I became the hero in capture the flag each game. I was the young prodigy my freinds called me until I injured my right gaming thumb (unrelated to cod)  Also My freinds used to call me that young bruce willis but that was for other reasons. Staying up for days on end with doritos stains on my white t shirt and upgraded camo guns on my mind I couldent beat it. To this day when I have the free time to hop on a game of team deathmatch or run around my  favriote map Backlot it brings a small tear to my eyes. A tear of joy, Uav online. Modern warefare was a special time in my life were everthing was just right.  Thankyou, PopsSincerly T-train99			"

												While this game is unbelievably nearing its 10 year anniversary, I still feel the need to express my thoughts and compliments towards this game. This is one of the few games I bother to write a review for, due to my extreme appreciation for it.I will be focusing my review on the story only, as there isnt much I can say about the multiplayer other than its better than the new garbage Activision puts out.I began playing this game when I was like 9, and it was simply just the most fun and cool game I had ever played as a kid. While I was probably a bit young to be playing it, it certainly gave me a lovely experience that I will never forget, what I wouldnt do to experience this game for the first time again... The story is simply beyond rich and well written, while it can be a little difficult to follow at times, it's still a near masterpiece of a campaign. That goes for all of the modern warfare series, but specifically applies to this game. It's a mixed bag of emotions with this game, it can be exciting, it can be suspenseful, and it can be saddening.The game itself isn't the prettiest for 2017, but in 2007 when this came out, it must have been like 4k is now, astonishing. Even though its almost ten years old, it still looks pretty decent.The game mechanics are standard at best, but like I've said, its from 2007 and you cant expect a Triple-A 2017 game engine.While this game has some flaws, the story makes up for it completely and has kept me coming back for countless playthroughs. I'll never forget the fantastic experience I've had playing this game.10/10 "

 Call of Duty® 4: Modern Warfare®  A series of that everyone knows and the fourth part which introduced a modern war. Currently it was released remaster of this production. which is not bad but available only when you buy CoD: Infinite Warfare what I think is pathetic. According to me, this is one of the best CoD's that you can buy. The game is designed in most for the multiplayer gameplay but the main campaign is very good but short, as it always happens with these games. Online game lasts for many hours of fun, however, as once the game was a lot of dynamic now it is about hiding in the corners and wait for the kill. There is not a lot of weapons but it's good because we do not have to check every weapon that suits us. Modes are pretty cool, standard nothing outstanding. In the game there are different kinds of perks that will improve our game for example, faster reload. And if it was not enough in the internet you can find servers with zombie mod which are really cool. I think it's great production from which I have many pleasant memories. Many hours once I lost and so far nothing has changed so much that it is a little less players and there is not that much cheaters in game. Definitely worth it to go back to the game for those few hours to play with friends.  "

												The game represents everything right about Call of Duty. It's similar yet somewhat dated movement system and game mechanics are likely to bring out the nostalgia within veterans of the series, and also offer new players a simpler more understandable way to play. This is beneficial to newcomers due to the recent Call of Duty installments being far too overcomplicated and unecessarily confusing to say the least. With a memorable campaign, a fun exciting multplayer mode and with many community made maps and servers to choose from, Modern Warfare is a gaming experience that has the ability to live on in the PC community for many years to come.

It has to be said that this game has the best multiplayer yet, even now ""9"" years after it was released!!! Even the servers are better.I've bought this game 6 times over the years (on different systems) and I keep coming back for more!Also IMO this has the best singleplayer campaign too!			"

												Best CoD multiplayer ever!Pure fun, no flying, no double jumping, no cloaking, no laser, no hearthbeat sensor, no EXO crap, no flying grenades, no pew pew. Between 3 or 4 attachment available and thats it. You can only use one of them. No stupid killstreaks, the same three for everyone. Had it years ago on PC and Xbox 360, bought it again (Lost CD key). This is Call of Duty for men, anyway the game is too barebones for kiddys.11/10 Will buy a fourth time if i have to. "

												Still lots of active players, servers and fun. Some servers are managed by single persons, some by communities/clans. Both are equally fun. If you get bored after a while, try a few mods. There are many out there that are actively played and are fun to be played. (I'd advice Freeze Tag (ftag))In my opinion, Call of Duty 4 is still the best Call of Duty out today.			"

												I discovered the Call of Duty franchise with a demo given by a French magazine. While I appreciated the WWII settings, I was less at ease with a nervous gameplay: bombing, shooting, running.... well, in other words, it was perhaps too fast for me.When I finally indulged myself in CoD Modern Warfare, I would have never though that the modern setting would be something that would make remake in my head the story. You're Soap, a new guy in Price's unit and you're going to be involded in the Russian Civil War and later, in a special team to stop the ultranationalist leader, an ex-weapon dealer. You're also Paul Jackson, a sergeant in the US Army, sent to an unknown country as part of an operation for freeing it from the rule of the new leader. You're even going to be Price but years ago...You're playing people that are in the same moment at opposite directions and your role is to survive. The gameplay isn't only shoot, load, shoot... it's also keeping your cover, destroy tanks, be silent when you need to be silent, snipe....The game is offering enough challenges to hook you up.Yet the nervous gameplay isn't still something I like. That's probably because I'm more used to Doom or Half-Life pace.The graphics are also quite good, though it's mainly revolving around a Middle East town or Russian forests. The only time you can enjoy something different is when you're in a plane above Price's team, clearing the path for them.Characters are people you're getting attached to, whether you're playing them or they're NPC. Yeah, true, it's Call of Duty, which means unexpected death. In the end, Soap is alive, though badly injured, as you're him during the end of the game. Price? You don't know, though CoD Modern Warfare 2 is featuring him. Jackson? Well, he's still somewhere in that unknown country. As for the others that were with you (Griggs, Nikolai, Vasquez, McMillan or Gaz), their fate is sealed in the game. It's up to you to follow the story to find about them.And the game is ranking high in my ""love soundtrack"" meter. Really appreciated these. Really fitting.The commands were probably the harder thing I had to master. Probably because of the cover I have to take when you're used to games without having none. And it's not always easy to fight your way through, even in the easy difficulty.Anyway, CoD Modern Warfare is really a very good game. Too bad the price is still high after all this year but hey, when there is a discount, go for it.			"

												It isn't as bad as they say, and it isn't as good as they say.As a whole it ends up a great deal on sale, and very easily the best game in the Call of Duty series, but it can't meet the hype and it isn't the atrocity the later entries have made it out to be.In essence, if you have to buy one Call of Duty it would be this one, and you wouldn't regret it anytime soon, as it includes lean (something they couldn't implement on consoles), console commands (increased fov becomes an option), dedicated servers, and mods (some of which were blatantly stolen from for features in later entries in the series), while delivering a story that isn't Michael Bay-esque and doesn't make any pretention about being incredibly gritty.

												The single player campaign is an intense, incredible experience, but it is short. To enhance the game's replay, Infinity Ward has included hidden Intel pieces in the game that, when found, unlock in-game single player cheats such as the ability to slow down the game temporarily, turn the game's colors black and white, or get infinite ammo. After finishing the game, the player also has access to an arcade mode, in which you try to get through the game or a single level with a limited amount of lives for the chance to get the high score. Call of Duty 4 comes with innovative and incredibly fun multiplayer.And now onto the multiplayer; the dedicated servers makes it lag free, which is one of the most vital things in multiplayer. The drip feed method of leveling up and unlocking guns as you progress is done at the right pace. The multiplayer consists of sixteen different maps with modes that include the traditional deathmatch and team deathmatch. Other game modes include Domination, in which players fight to secure objective points, Sabotage, in which players must plant bombs by an enemy objective, and Search and Destroy, in which one team defends an objective while the other team attacks. The multiplayer is set up for fast, frenzied gameplay, with wide open maps that have multiple methods of ingress for most areas. There aren't a lot of places in any of the maps that are conducive to camping, which forces most players to stay on the run to survive. Also, whenever you are killed, you are shown your death from the enemy's point of view. This is a cool feature, which lets you know who killed you and how, but it also reveals hiding spots and other player's strategies. The savvy player will watch the killcam replay and seek out their killer's hiding spot, which is a point of controversy, although the killcam can be turned off in private matches. Ultimately, the best strategy in multiplayer is to keep moving at all times and keep a pair of eyes in the back of your head. Customization of the guns make everyone's play style possible, and it also keeps you wanting to play to unlock more things for each gun. Everyone has a unique character, you can be a stealthy sniper, fast shot-gunner, etc. It keeps it fresh and unique. The weapons are fun to use realistic, and are balanced too. The sniper rifles are awesome, fun to use and addictive. Overall, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is an intense gaming experience from start to finish. The story is conveyed much better than the average first person shooters, the gameplay is varied enough to stay fresh, the graphics and sound both deliver, and the multiplayer is addictive. If Call of Duty 4 can attract enough fanboys away from Halo and Counter Strike to experience it, we may have a new contender for favourite first person shooter of all time. It is worth purchasing. Buy it!My Rating - ""Phenomenal"" Traditional Rating - 10/10.			"

												Way better than the new call of dutys being released will ever be. Despite the age of this game the graphics are still pretty damn good, the people online are fun to play with, and i havent really noticed any hackers or any of that crap online so far. The campaign is good but thats not what i got it for, i beat it a good couple of times on xbox 360. All in all, this is way better than advanced warfare or infinite warfare could ever be. I wish they would bring this kind of COD back. Considering how old this game is, however, the $20 dollar price point is much too expensive for a game this old, just a way for steam to make money im sure. I only had to pay $9.99 for my copy.

												This game had many top notch review ratings and still rocks. However EvenBalance's PunkBuster is no longer supported for CoD4 so you may have to disable it for both CoD4 client and server as PB is not recommended if it will kick you or your players if PB was enabled in CoD4 server. Using the PBSetup.exe won't help you to get the latest PB Client for CoD4 anymore.Activision appears to lost too much support for CoD4 - such as Punkbuster, Master server and possibly more. I've found out the best way is to install CoD 4X v1.8 patch to wipe out those bugs and server connection problems at once! I won't explain in too much detail but this appears to be the best method to resolve those CoD4 Client issues for our CoD4 players. Please try this download out now and tell us what you think!

												i remember when i first played this on ps3, it got me into cod but its went downhill since then (after blops 1) but after buying this for 19.99 i think it was worth it, you need a software like GameTracker to get online but if you can get around that its amazing, aside from the awesome singleplayer that i beat on ps3 this has mutiple mods like Galactic Warfare and plenty of zombie maps to keep me entertained for years to come... PROS - MODS, Singleplayer, Galactic Warfare (a mod but idc), arcade mode (if you beat the game and some cheats too) Cons - Honestly none, this is a masterpiece unlike the rest after blops 1 (only thing is connection errors..) 10/10(i beat the game in 7.2 hrs but i will defo play this more, if your reading this and you've not played CoD I'd recommend to buy this NOW!!!!)

												Call of Duty 4 is oddly a lot of fun. The campaign is good, however I prefer the multiplayer. Unlike the other Call of Duty games that are on the PC, there are actually a lot of solid community made multiplayer game modes. Gamemodes such as deathrun are very in depth and offer a almost never ending supply of laughs and general fun. With such a massive community of developers there will almost always be new content coming into the game. In conclusion, I highly recommend purchasing Call of Duty 4.			"

However, this game is most likely the BIGGEST EXCEPTION to any First Person Shooters because the amazing detail in the game completely makes up for it.If this video game was a screenplay, it would win every Academy Award, including Best Storyline, Best Actors, Best Soundtrack, and for at its time, Best Visual Effects. It was SO good I could not leave my computer screen for 5 entire hours (which rarely happens to me!) Why pay $90 for Ghosts when you can pay $20 for this!

												Say what you will about what the Call of Duty franchise has become, but I will not hear a bad word said about the Modern Warfare series. CoD 4, for me at least, is one of the finest examples of video games as an art form. From the story, to the writing, to the combat, music and visual - this game remains a classic, and a reminder that the name ""Call of Duty"" once carried tremendous weight.			"

												An FPS game that has stood the test of time. CoD 4 has proven that what really makes a multiplayer game such as this great is the dedicated servers--and the admins that run it. To give a specific example, the FF (Fatal Forces) servers have been around for years and still have a many dedicated admins and a large playerbase. There are even servers with different player made game modes, most notable being zombie survival.This game is also a better example of what a first person shooter should be than the later CoDs. There are less gimmicks and ridiculous exploits (like quickscoping or commando knifing) while still having mechanics like C4 traps (and knifing but without the commando perk) that can still liven and diversify the gameplay. The killstreaks are not overpowered, making it more difficult for a single player to dominate the game (especially if they are hacking) and consequently putting more emphasis on gun firefights and teamwork.So if you are ever going to buy a Call of Duty game, this is the only one you will ever need.

												This game set a standard for first person shooters in the singleplayer AND multiplayer aspects. The epic singleplayer campaign with its amazing cinematic quality is truely a marvel to play through. The multiplayer, I'll be it, is a bit unbalanced, with higher level players recieving and advantage, it is still amazing and innovative for its time. The multiplayer community is booming with mods and dedicated servers for hundreds of hours of gameplay. I would even buy it for $50 but at $20 you can't find any better deal on Steam.			"

												I bought this game to compare with the upcoming Cod: MWR, and also to experience a call of duty with high remarks as I joined call of duty on a later title, that being its sequel MW2. So here was an exciting journey. Cod4's single player is a god damn blast. Still holds a strong story with those key memberable moments and characters. Always a great campaign to play, which was the primary reason why I bought it. Now multiplayer was a shocker. The simplicity of it is a amazing. Having so many games where it just bloated with content that you have no idea what to use, it was not the case with this game. And it was refreshing. Unlocks were simple, and gameplay is still solid. That being, the maps in this game are solid. Each have their own unique characteristics about them, and rarely any are bad. It just depends on your play style, but all in all they are so good. That being there is a learning curve when it comes to checks spots, made locations, and walls that are penetrable. Also note nades are ridiculous and spammy. Surprisingly the community is still strong however most servers are tdm which is disappointing as I really wished to play SnD but that's alright. I think I got my full. All in all this game is a must play. One of gamings greatest leaps with great story, characters, and multiplayer. How Cod has changed...			"

												I am the kind of person that absolutely HATES First Person Shooters, ESPECIALLY Call of Duty. I can barely stand even the most subtle shooters such as Borderlands or Bioshock. However, this game is most likely the BIGGEST EXCEPTION to any First Person Shooters because the amazing detail in the game completely makes up for it.If this video game was a screenplay, it would win every Academy Award, including Best Storyline, Best Actors, Best Soundtrack, and for at its time, Best Visual Effects. It was SO good I could not leave my computer screen for 5 entire hours (which rarely happens to me!) Why pay $90 for Ghosts when you can pay $20 for this! Seriously though, you have not lived until you've played this, so I heavily advise you to immediately buy this game!!69/10  "

												*Single Player Review*This is what started it all. Still said to be the best by alot people today, others say it is ONE of the best....me? well what I think is it is one of the best (my fav being MW2) why do I think that is?:1.REALISM: yes while cod isn't realistic, cod 4 is based on serious situations and not on some mad up BS like AW and black ops 3. You start off training for the british sas and meeting GAZ and captain price then move onto your first mission stealing documents on an enemy ship. this is awesome becuase 1. they're britsh and not just americans 2. they are REAL. Then another person you play as is a marine, well you play as 2 (won't spoil what happens to the first).2.CHARACTERS: The best are, Britsh SAS: GAZ, CAP PRICE and Macmillian. Marines: Ssgt. Griggs and Vasquez. ENEMIES: Imran Zakheav and Khaled AL-Asad3.GAMEPLAY: Typical in this day and age of call of duty but it is so simple and fluid that you cannot hate and not have fun in cod with the gameplay.4.STORY: tbh I have to google it but it's pretty much an anti-western terriost group seized a country with oil so the americans go in to capture the leader AS-Asad and pretty folds out from there.5.CONS: If i gotta be honest i'm having a hard thinking about what's wrong...so yeah...nothing, nothing that would take away from the full experience atleast.6.CONCLUSION: COD4 is an amazing game all around without a doubt. If you have'nt played it already you are REALLY missing out go out and BUY THIS GAME. I rate Call Of Duty 4 Modern Warfare Single Player 9/10. Thank you for reading please give feedback i would really appreciate it. THANKS.			"

												I only started playing COD 4 Multiplayer in 2014. And for a 7 year old game (at that time), I had to learn how to play with the community who still plays this game. I did not play COD 4 when it was released in 2007. I have only played the Singleplayer prior to purchasing this game on steam. I have to admit that, the learning curve was steep. For the first few months, i struggled to learn the maps and the guns. At one time, i almost gave up. But i endured for 4 months, playing this game everyday. Now with 53 hours under my belt, I can safetly say that is was all worth it. The community is great, no whining 10 year old whom have somehow slept with your mom, but a community who is united to support this game, as the multiplayer here is the best of the franchise. Coming from a person who has played competitive COD at one point, I wish i was born earlier so that i could've taken part in MLG when COD 4 was around. 11/10 would buy again.			"

												A fun arena shooter with some flaws. The game is still very active and has dedicated servers that support up to 64 players. The customization and ranking up make the game pretty addicting at times, but the skill cap is much lower than that of other arena shooters such as quake and unreal tournament. However, playing objective based modes can lead to more tactical play that helps make up for the low skill cap. Despite this, there are still issues with some unbalanced perks such as last stand and martyrdom. The campaign is also a very short and very heavily linear and scripted. The game play in the campaign is just flat out boring as a result. Despite its flaws, if you want a fun, casual multiplayer shooter with support for both small and large numbers of player, as well as some mods, this is a good choice.7/10			"

												I was hoping for controller support, which it didn't have, but I'm glad the keybord and mouse were easy to learn. The story was beautifully written and the multiplayer was really fun to play. I was really surprised that people were working together in the game. It seems that even the maps themselves pushed for some level of strategy and teamwork (try finding that in Ghosts). It's also fun setting up private servers and screwing about with the console commands.			"

												There's no doubt as to why old school players prefer this Call of Duty game in comparison to the older versions of the series. The hitboxes are more accurate, the GUI is extremely simple and easy to grasp. Each gun has their own unique feel which really grasps the player into the game. The graphics from when the game was made is indeed playable, graphics isn't an issue in this game as the mechanics and engine run so smooth.I'd suggest getting this on PC due to cheat protection software, punkbuster. The servers are also player hosted and you get a server-list so that you can choose whether or not you want to play with mods and interfere with annoying hackers. Consoles do not offer this.I have yet to play the story mode so I have no review on that for the time being. Multiplayer is a must.			"

												You know, I used to think highly of Activision because of the Call of Duty series. When this game came out, everyone was losing their ♥♥♥♥ and I include myself on that. Even back then this company was sh#tting bad multiplatform crap games that most people never liked, but this one made us all forget about it. Is it good, is it worth it? Well, with the next CoD of Duty having a remake of this game, I might as well bother to review this. And as usual, I'm going to start with the stuff it does poorly. Now there's not much to that, but the issues it has are big.First and foremost, the autosave feature. Jesus #nal f#cking christ, remember when you could just save or quicksave in games!? This is one of the games that pushed the auto-save feature like it was the hot sh#t forward, like it or not. And I don't like it one bit, it's complete bullsh#t. Let me explain: Whenever the hell the game feels like, it will save. You have NO control over it, and the saves are at complete random. It can save twice in a row with barely a few seconds in between, or it might not even safe more than twice on a level. It's way more painful than you think, you can be fighting for over 5 minutes, suddenly get killed by a random RPG and suddenly have to replay most if not all of that. Even worse, it manages to ruin some of the best moments of the game. One of the missions that most people love of this game ends up with you, having to wait for an helicopter that's around 9 kilometers away. I got one auto save when that last objective was told, then I got another auto save when the helicopter was still 7 kilometers away. And guess what, those 7 last kilometers are around 6 to 10 minutes of intense shooting action with way too many enemies storming your place at the same time from all directions. And since I was playing on a high difficulty (more on that later), I died a lot, and had to replay the same area over and over. Bottom line, either have good auto-saves or just LET THE PLAYER SAVE MANUALLY.The other issue this game has is, as I said, the difficulty. Is the game really difficult? No, mainly the different difficulty modes are a standard case of artificial difficulty. You know what changes? You can take more shots, which is normal, but it also changes the amount of grenades the enemies throw, and makes enemies see you as the main target, ignoring all other NPC's. DO YOU KNOW WHAT HELL LOOKS LIKE!? HOW ABOUT A SMALL CORRIDOR CONSTANTLY BEING STORMED BY GRENADES!? It gets REALLY OLD, REALLY FAST.That being said though, this is easily the best CoD game there is. There's a reason why it's getting somewhat remastered on the new ♥♥♥♥ CoD. It really is a good experience. The story, while most people would over-look it, it's quite entertaining and decent for all the ♥♥♥♥ CoD games get these days. It's not too complex but it's catchy enough for you to want to know what's next. It also isn't too long, which is a shame, but also includes a kickass extra level that aparently is supposed to be really hard, but I kind of beated it on my second try on the Hard difficulty.Gameplay is also okay. You know how all CoD games after MW2 tried to constantly force the multiplayer unlockables into the story mode, as of to tell you ""GO PLAY THE MULTIPLAYER INSTEAD YOU F#CKING ♥♥♥♥!""? That makes the gameplay feel stupidly shallow and that doesn't happen here. You get in one mission help from a helicopter, and later the ability to call for bombs thrown by jets, that's it. I wish more CoDs just did that. It also changes the pace multiple times instead of throwing countless enemies over and over, although it does have constant respawning npc's, something I don't like at all.The mission ""All Ghillied Up"" deserves a mention of it's own. If you have played it, then you know why. It's one of the best levels I've ever played and sure as hell is memorable. It's quite inspired from games such as STALKER (funny enough I have no idea what the enemies talk about in this level but I did hear one ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥ NPC mention a ""Stalker"" through the first stage of the level), and the soundtrack of it is just perfect. The second stage also ends strong, although as I said, it's painful on high difficulties because of the auto-save.The graphics are also okay, which seems to be what most people are looking forward on the remastered edition, something that quite pisses me off. IT STILL LOOKS GOOD TODAY, YOU F#CKING IDIOTS! WHY WASTE THE MONEY BUYING A SH#T GAME FOR THE REMASTERED WHEN YOU CAN JUST BUY THIS!? The only bad thing the graphics have are the ocasional weird bugs, like NPC's ignoring each other even though they're supposed to be hostile and corpses freezing in mid air until you die and the game reloads an auto-save.Lastly, the multiplayer. I must say I usually ignore the multiplayer aspect on these reviews, specially if the game is this old, however this game did it right. All these new CoD's just flood the game with upgrades and killstreak unlockables which completely miss the point of the modes to begin with, this one kept it really simple and it's fun. However good luck finding anyone to play with. I know for a fact that it still has a strong community, but once the remastered version comes out, I don't think anyone but old school fans will stick around.Is this game worth it? Yeah. Is it worth the 20€ price-tag, though? Nah, it's good but not that much. I'd say, get it if it drops around 5€ or so, but get it if you're truly interested on it and might want to give the multiplayer a try. Otherwise, while it has really cool moments, you might wanna play something else instead.TL;DR Edition: The good CoD game. Really good controls and story, although it has some cheap difficulty crap and a quite terrible auto-save feature. It also has a quite high price tag for how old the game is, if you're truly interested you better wait for a sale, but it's a really good game.			"

												I just got this game today and I'm having a ball on the multiplayer, Kill kill and kill, so fast paced and killing is rewarding. Unlocking new guns and attachments. I do not believe the Multiplayer is as good as it is in Black ops 2, but Cod4 Definitely is worth it's $20. It's a nice casual Call of Duty so you can just sit in a 24/7 server and play for as long as you like (you'll have to play the long ♥♥♥ games though if you're playing them) Cod4 is a great starting Call of Duty for new players and will keep having tonnes of player for years to come. All though I prefer black ops 2 over this game Cod4 doesn't get dull for a second! I was having so much fun with my stealth class (Ak silencer, Usp Silenced, 3x Special Perk UAV jammer and Deep penatration Frag and Stun) I could get Quad- Five Feeds absolutely amazing game. Balanced and Fair and I never felt 1 gun was OP.Cod4 has a fun singleplayer mode, but I'll be playing multiplayer as I've finished singleplayer numerous times. 10/10			"

												This game was the one that put Activision and the whole Call of Duty franchise on the map. But unlike the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ children that it spawned, COD4 is a prime example of ""simple is better"". There are 3 killstreaks, 3, and that's all you'd ever want because it is the gameplay, the brilliant maps, and the deadliest of deadly weaponry that count in this game. The proof is in the puddin' and this game brings buckets of it. Released in 2007 (as of this review this game is 10 years old).... and the online community has adored it, and promoted it to this day and for many years to come im sure.By far my favorite shooter game everTry it out once, glance up at the clock and realize that you've been playing for 12 hours straight... that's just what it does.ENVOY RATED: 10/10			"

												Considered one of the best in the Call Of Duty series and I would have to agree. The visuals and graphics are great (as close as you'll want to get to actual combat) and the story is pretty engaging. The switching back and forth between characters is well done. By the end of the game you'll actually care who lives or dies.A warning on the difficulty level though. Set it too high and this game can get really frustrating really quick. Makes you appreciate the kind of hell real life soldiers have to go through.			"

												The fact that this game is still being used at LAN events and competitions and will continue to be used in 2016 is proof enough of this being a great game. Probably the best Call of Duty game for competitive play (MW2 is probably the second most played on console in the franchise but for PC, this game is a must have). Definitely in the top five all time. (Don't look at my play time, look at the facts.)			"

												Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is probably the highest rated Call of Duty game. The reason is not because of it's gameplay mechanics or its graphics - but its story. Throughout the game people die, people suffer, and the story is quite captivating and manages to keep on pace even if you tend to die a lot in FPS games. So get this game, if for nothing else, for the story, because it's totally worth it.Pros-Fantastic Story-Excellent Characters/Cast-Wonderful Locations-Good Graphics-Great Performance (very few buggies)Cons-Repetitive Gameplay (shooting, shooting, more shooting)-Somewhat Crappy Mechanics (can't ""feel"" the guns or explosions)-Lackluster UI/Menus (so Sarah Plain and Tall)Verdict: Get it. A game worth your time. "

												Mea, It's a great shooter game for sure. For being old graphics are defently nice. I was able to run this with high graphics on a $300 laptop without any sort of graphics card, so performance is great. Multiplayer is not so great. Whilst there are always matches to join, alot of them are modded and require something to download. If you are new to the game (like me) there are no real matches that are just a bunch of new folks. Would be nice if there were ranked matches. As for the campaign, umm, I killed some people on a boat, and got board and went to go play some AC. So over all, if your not new to mouse and keyboard shooters and you don't mind downloading mods to get in the majority of matches, this game is great, however it is just not ""my cup of tea"".			"

												The best Call of Duty.I only bought this on PC in 2016, simply because it was in the Steam Spring Sale, just for some nostalgia. The game still looks really good for its age (released in 2007), and still retains one of the best storylines in the CoD franchise. Price and Soap are lovable, and really make you want to play the story ot the end to  kill Zakhaev . The guns are also good, without too many stupid attachments and skins like you find in CoD these days, and follows a sensible setting that is quite relevant now.Overall, a great game, and in my opinion the best CoD.10/10			"

												My third stop in my journey to play all the CODs (for PC) in chronological order. Reviewed for its playability today.Pros:- Pretty good graphics- Decent story, although not particulary memorable- Some pretty sweet maps in the campaign- Great, simple multiplier with classes and ranks (and still lots of people playing)- Since this is the first of the COD games with their famous multiplayer features, it's as basic and un-bogged down as possible; good old fashioned, quick-paced gameplay- Runs smoothlyCons:- Campaign is pretty short - finished it in about 6-6.5 hours on advanced difficulty- You'll find yourself at the maximum multiplayer rank before too, too long (no prestige system or anything that I can see)- Some features you might miss from later games in multiplayer- Some cheesy dialogue in campaign, and I only found myself caring for about one or two other characters			"

This is a solid game on PC and consoles and never seems to dissapoint with the story, gameplay and suprisingly the graphics. This game is a definite recommend to new comers and veterans of the series alike!P.S: If you want to play this again (that's if you have played it on consoles a couple of years back) and don't know whether you should get the remaster just don't. The remaster is just a cheap cash in method from Infinity Ward, if anything the original looks better on PC than the remaster (just my opinion though).			"

												Definitely the best call of duty game ever made in my personal opinion. If you are contemplating getting modern warfare remastered or this (the original) I would recommend the original. it runs better even on the highest settings ( depending on the specs of your pc) and all in all it feels smoother than the remastered as the new one requires a bit more higher specs as it's new. If you are worried about the original game being barron because the remastered has been released that isn't the case as people are still playing the original because it runs better.			"

												Pretty good alternative to CSGO, since Valve is messing up pretty hard recently. CoD 4 offers a ""hard to master"" and intensive gameplay and is not comparable to the todays Call of Dutys. The game offers a server browser and full mod support which creates many different servers and difficulties.I rate 9/11Also, the story is not bad. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)			"

Reviewed for its playability today.Pros:- Pretty good graphics- Decent story, although not particulary memorable- Some pretty sweet maps in the campaign- Great, simple multiplier with classes and ranks (and still lots of people playing)- Since this is the first of the COD games with their famous multiplayer features, it's as basic and un-bogged down as possible; good old fashioned, quick-paced gameplay- Runs smoothlyCons:- Campaign is pretty short - finished it in about 6-6.5 hours on advanced difficulty- You'll find yourself at the maximum multiplayer rank before too, too long (no prestige system or anything that I can see)- Some features you might miss from later games in multiplayer- Some cheesy dialogue in campaign, and I only found myself caring for about one or two other characters			"

I am still amazed of the ammount of servers that are still alive, you can find matches easierly in CoD4 than in MW2 for example.

												I decided to rewrite a review of this game. So, it is still an amazing game. I would dare say the best call of duty ever made..... so far. As far as servers goes, there a still a decent amount up and running, but that also depends on the gamemode that you like to play. For me, hardcore and core do not do it for me anymore, hence why I only play on modded servers now, to have a different feel of realism. Either way, just a very good game. Just know that you might get bored of core pretty easily, so make sure you turn on the filter to find modded servers.			"

It's kinna crazy that a game from 2007 is better optimized on PC and just more fun in general then Infinite Warfare, a game released in 2016. If you're looking what to buy mwr or the OG cod 4 I would definitely buy this first and buy mwr for the single player later on when the price drops. Or if you're looking for a newer multiplayer experience along with this I would recommend getting black ops 2 or 3.			"

												Infinity Ward's fourth installment to the world renoun Call of Duty franchise, dubbed Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, is an instant classic and a prime example of first-person shooter multiplayer excellence.The campagin is an adrenaline-fueled ride with some serious shock moments that are still make various top ten lists today. But this game really shines in the multiplayer, both online and on your local network (LAN). Call of Duty 4 was the last game in the franchise to include native offline multiplayer/LAN play.Call of Duty 4 is the first game in the franchise that introduced the perk and levelling system for multiplayer, which has given the title incredible longevity for many players. While this has been included in every Call of Duty title since, it is the original Modern Warfare that pulled it off the best as it gave players reason to play extensively without going overboard.If you're looking for a great competitive FPS gameplay with a high replay value, extensibility and overall enjoyability, then you should purchase this game. Who knows, maybe you could host the best LAN party with your mates with this title? 10/10			"

It is terrific and holds up well to this day, the standard setter for all the derivative sequels (thanks Treyarch!) that followed.P.S. A shoutout to the old Infinity Ward... I miss you baby.			"

												CoD 4:Modern Warfare is a literal classic. A must-have for your game library. Try to think not of the argument that it's a stereotypical CoD on the multiplayer side, but that it is a very arcade version of CoD. the single player is immersive, i had alot of fun with my playthrough, and the multiplayer is more arcade-type gameplay. overall alot of fun. 10/13 headshots.

												Infinity Ward's fourth installment to the world renoun Call of Duty franchise, dubbed Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, is an instant classic and a prime example of first-person shooter multiplayer excellence.The campagin is an adrenaline-fueled ride with some serious shock moments that are still make various top ten lists today. But this game really shines in the multiplayer, both online and on your local network (LAN). Call of Duty 4 was the last game in the franchise to include native offline multiplayer/LAN play.Call of Duty 4 is the first game in the franchise that introduced the perk and levelling system for multiplayer, which has given the title incredible longevity for many players. While this has been included in every Call of Duty title since, it is the original Modern Warfare that pulled it off the best as it gave players reason to play extensively without going overboard.If you're looking for a great competitive FPS gameplay with a high replay value, extensibility and overall enjoyability, then you should purchase this game. Who knows, maybe you could host the best LAN party with your mates with this title? 10/10			"

												This, Call of Duty: World at War, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Call of Duty: Black Ops were the last good games in the series that were released after Call of Duty 3. This is a solid game on PC and consoles and never seems to dissapoint with the story, gameplay and suprisingly the graphics. This game is a definite recommend to new comers and veterans of the series alike!P.S: If you want to play this again (that's if you have played it on consoles a couple of years back) and don't know whether you should get the remaster just don't. The remaster is just a cheap cash in method from Infinity Ward, if anything the original looks better on PC than the remaster (just my opinion though).			"

												COD4 has the best multiplayer and singleplayer component of any COD to date that I've played. The campaign's missions are all creative and fun to play. All Ghillied Up, No Fighting in the War Room and Mile High Club are among the best missions in any COD. Finishing Mile High Club on Veteran was one of the most rewarding achievements I've ever recieved. Such an amazing campaign...except for that ending of One Shot, One Kill where you have to wait on the helicopter. That was horrible on veteran.Multiplayer is obviously why COD makes the billions and COD4 is arguably the peak of the franchise. Struck the perfect formula of leveling and unlocking in a competitve FPS. Subsequent CODs simply added more killstreaks, maps, guns, modes etc to keep things fresh, but they are all building off of the success that COD4 created. Amazing game.			"

												Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is one of the best call of duty games ever made and is almost like a benchmark for what other Call of Duty games should strive to be.Although out of this games greatest achivements there are a few flaws with the game. Like animations. I found that the locations in this game seemed to be either the desert or dark and grassy. I would have like to see a more wide verity of destinations because the ones in the game seemed to be exactly the same without much change in enviroment. Other than that my experience with the campaign was excellent  My other problem with the game was of the multiplayer part of it. The multiplayer while fun with lots of weapons and fun maps taken from the campaign was dificult to have fun with because of many problems with punk buster messing up or not installing in the first place. I also took issue with the fact that to even play the multiplayer I had to plug in my mic which I was not informed of earlier and took me a while to figure out without the help of one of my friends informing me.All and all though if I were to rate my experience and enjoyment with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare it would be a 8.4/10			"

												Pretty fun game I bought this during steam sales would recommend buying during sales because for how old the game is its not really worth $20 but i guess thats just activision being activision...Anyway the story line is pretty good in fact Modern Warfare 1,2 and 3 all have great a great story, (back when call of duty campains where good) in this game you play as both S.A.S and U.S.M.C fighting against both middle eastern and russain forces, and you even do a joint operation thats pretty cool I would say.Call of Duty 4 is pretty well optimized and I had no problems running this game even during a Multiplayer session with about 48 players in the game. this is probably one of few call of duty games that are well developed for pc most of the new ones get bad reviews becaues of the ports not being very well and probably suppy drops too but this one is really well done.Now lets talk about the pros and cons of this game.Pros:-Great story line it makes you want to buy the other modern warfare games to continue the story.-Well optimized -Gameplay is really solid and fun -Visuals are neat obviously this is not the BEST looking game ever but it still looks pretty nice in my honest opinion-Game has some nice mods and it even comes with a mod launcher when you purchase the game-Multiplayer is still very much active some good amount of servers you can find with no problem-all DLC is free Cons-With a game thats almost 10 years old you can expect cheaters to be in your lobbys but even then you can probably avoid them if you`re in a server with admins.-the game sometimes feels about weird when it comes to melees at least from my personal experience.-the anti-cheat is no longer suported so you might need to keep an eye on who is in your games when playing MP.that pretty much my review for this game again like I said at the begining I would defiantly recommend this game if you never played it or even if you want to play it again for nostalgia reasons but buy it on sale its worth to save some money, I hope this review helps someone. :D "

												COD4 has the best multiplayer and singleplayer component of any COD to date that I've played. The campaign's missions are all creative and fun to play. All Ghillied Up, No Fighting in the War Room and Mile High Club are among the best missions in any COD. Finishing Mile High Club on Veteran was one of the most rewarding achievements I've ever recieved. Such an amazing campaign...except for that ending of One Shot, One Kill where you have to wait on the helicopter. That was horrible on veteran.Multiplayer is obviously why COD makes the billions and COD4 is arguably the peak of the franchise. Struck the perfect formula of leveling and unlocking in a competitve FPS. Subsequent CODs simply added more killstreaks, maps, guns, modes etc to keep things fresh, but they are all building off of the success that COD4 created. Amazing game.			"

												Singleplayer:After all those years I finally played and completed the singleplayer from Call of duty 4. I can directly say that In my opinion this is the best cod in gameplay perspective. I was really emersed in many levels, and it felt like I was in the game. Sadly later it was harder to get emersed because on veteran difficulty you will see some problems. The main ones: infinite spawning enemies, some bad checkpoints, enemies spawning at triggered points and enemies throwing to many grenades. Also this game can feel at some parts a little old. The graphics are not that impressive anymore ( I still think it is good, but it could use some more color ) and the audio is not that great. I think the story wasn't that special, but I still liked that it wasn't pro-army. Afterall I would recommend for people who never played the sp from cod 4 to play it on normal because it can be irritating sometimes.Multiplayer: I can say it is still getting great support from the community. There are many great mods And there is still enough people playing even at this moment. I also think that will stay so for many years because there is no 'better' replacement for the fans. Because the later cod's don't get mod support + are seen as less balanced. I also agree that this is the best cod for multiplayer. In short:Play the game in normal. This is ( in my opinion ) the best cod if you look at the gameplay from sp & mp perspective. Game can maybe look/feel old somethimes. Multiplayer is still alive and kicking.			"

												COD 4, or Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, has long been heralded as one of the greatest Call of Duty game, if not one of the greatest first person shooters ever made. It was one of the pioneers of the combat simulation first person shooter genre of games.I can tell you first hand that all the praise for this game is well deserved. The music and story are simply astounding. The graphics, for its time, were out of this world, but I honestly think the graphics are still good enough to hold its own against the modern day (Get it? Modern Warfare? Modern day? No? Nevermind...) first person shooters.I'm not a huge COD player, but personally, I loved this game.My rating:9/10			"

												Pretty fun game I bought this during steam sales would recommend buying during sales because for how old the game is its not really worth $20 but i guess thats just activision being activision...Anyway the story line is pretty good in fact Modern Warfare 1,2 and 3 all have great a great story, (back when call of duty campains where good) in this game you play as both S.A.S and U.S.M.C fighting against both middle eastern and russain forces, and you even do a joint operation thats pretty cool I would say.Call of Duty 4 is pretty well optimized and I had no problems running this game even during a Multiplayer session with about 48 players in the game. this is probably one of few call of duty games that are well developed for pc most of the new ones get bad reviews becaues of the ports not being very well and probably suppy drops too but this one is really well done.Now lets talk about the pros and cons of this game.Pros:-Great story line it makes you want to buy the other modern warfare games to continue the story.-Well optimized -Gameplay is really solid and fun -Visuals are neat obviously this is not the BEST looking game ever but it still looks pretty nice in my honest opinion-Game has some nice mods and it even comes with a mod launcher when you purchase the game-Multiplayer is still very much active some good amount of servers you can find with no problem-all DLC is free Cons-With a game thats almost 10 years old you can expect cheaters to be in your lobbys but even then you can probably avoid them if you`re in a server with admins.-the game sometimes feels about weird when it comes to melees at least from my personal experience.-the anti-cheat is no longer suported so you might need to keep an eye on who is in your games when playing MP.that pretty much my review for this game again like I said at the begining I would defiantly recommend this game if you never played it or even if you want to play it again for nostalgia reasons but buy it on sale its worth to save some money, I hope this review helps someone. :D "

												Ghosts got you down? then drop a cool $20 on either this game or W@W and you will not miss it in the slightest. This was before Call of duty got muddled up  and full of useless excess. Like the maps in this game are unique but you still know where your going. It seems in the new Cods the maps make no sense and the Create a Classes are just overloaded.  See the beauty of it is that they could have made this game as complex as the call of duties nowadays but they knew it didn't need it.... and it was before Activision got greedy. Just good maps a few guns, attachments, game modes and addictive gameplay and BAM!!! Cod4. As a player who has put countless hours on this game across many platforms, the fact that I still enjoy playing it should speak for itself.

												Infinity Ward's fourth installment to the world renoun Call of Duty franchise, dubbed Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, is an instant classic and a prime example of first-person shooter multiplayer excellence.The campagin is an adrenaline-fueled ride with some serious shock moments that are still make various top ten lists today. But this game really shines in the multiplayer, both online and on your local network (LAN). Call of Duty 4 was the last game in the franchise to include native offline multiplayer/LAN play.Call of Duty 4 is the first game in the franchise that introduced the perk and levelling system for multiplayer, which has given the title incredible longevity for many players. While this has been included in every Call of Duty title since, it is the original Modern Warfare that pulled it off the best as it gave players reason to play extensively without going overboard.If you're looking for a great competitive FPS gameplay with a high replay value, extensibility and overall enjoyability, then you should purchase this game. Who knows, maybe you could host the best LAN party with your mates with this title? 10/10			"

The campaign is rock solid and a ton of fun. You can play it over and over again and not get bored of it, excellent campaign! The multiplayer isn't as bad as it seems, finding a game maybe a little hard, and you'll run into a hacker from time to time, but overall it's OK.Would only buy for Campaign8.5/10			"

It's kinna crazy that a game from 2007 is better optimized on PC and just more fun in general then Infinite Warfare, a game released in 2016. If you're looking what to buy mwr or the OG cod 4 I would definitely buy this first and buy mwr for the single player later on when the price drops. Or if you're looking for a newer multiplayer experience along with this I would recommend getting black ops 2 or 3.			"

												Pros:+ Good story with emphasis on the threats of our time.+ A strong atmosphere is set from the beginning with the intro mission and cut scenes.+ Great character build. Cpt. Price and the villains are very memorable.+ Weapons feel superior and powerful. You don't have to empty a whole clip into an enemy's face like in CoD2 to bring him down.+ The environments where the missions take place help to enhance the feeling of modern day warfare.+ Lot's of replay value.+ Tactical approach is supported instead of going in guns blazing.Cons:- The game's extremely short, the credits came up when I thought I was a quarter through.In general:Video games have it easy depicting modern day asymmetrical conflicts compared to historical battle arrangements. These in-and-out missions with a small number of participants involved go well with the 'one man army' concept that video games are bound to. I hated CoD 2 for that reason. World War 2 was anything but a place for a 'one man army'. It was quite the opposite, there were statistics on how many tens of thousands of men would be needed to advance 3-4 miles in Battle of Normandy and likewise. The gore, the confusion and the feeling of being overwhelmed were just not present in CoD 2. The feeling of having the upper hand on the battlefield feels just right in CoD4: Modern Warfare because the way wars are fought has changed.			"

												As much as I bash this series, this game still remains good. It was the first Black Ops game that was when I got out of the series. The story in this game is actually good, and there is still a strong multiplayer community, though, since I last played this on console, multiplayer on PC has made it so matches have tons more players, possibly too many for the map size. Still, a lot of fun, and a good reminder why I played this a lot in middle school.			"

												Still probably the best CoD ever made. Though being almost 9 years old. It still plays better than Black ops 3 and the Modern Call of duty games they throw at us each year! Highly recommend this game if you want to play for a bit of nostalgic  fun.			"

												Despite being ten years old, this game is still one of the best shooters, and arguably one of the best games ever made. The campaign isn't as handholdy as the other CoD campaigns and is really entertaining. And the multiplayer...well, does it really need an explanation to how great it is.			"

												Still the greatest call of duty ever made.  The campaign, although simple & linear, stll holds up as a satisfying experience.  The online multiplayer is the most balanced out of all cod's ever made.			"

												Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is the sucessor to Call of Duty 3. Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare takes place in modern times. Its campaign is really good and solid, whereas the multiplayer is the same way but it is no longer populated with legitamate servers. This game has a lot of Prophunt, Deathrun, and other servers if you're into that. This game is very good and at its state right now it'd rate it a 6/10			"

												Call of Duty 4 is and always will be the best in the entire CoD franchise. After MW1, the entire franchise went to hell, excluding zombies mode and spec ops.			"

												Very good game, the storyline is very good.  The story took me 8 hours to complete, the only thing is that it's multiplayer isn't working.    However, it is very fun, very emotional, you can get to attached to the characters, and it has recoil unlike a lot of the other Call of Duty games.			"
