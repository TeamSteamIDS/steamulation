												-RUSHING PRIVATE RYAN-We set out in the morning, warily checking windows, corners, anywhere the Germans could spring a trap or an ambush.  Johannson was in the lead, Garand at the ready and bayonet fixed improperly.  Rook was shadowing him, double checking each spot that Johannson had checked before.  I was in the middle with Peters, helping him carry the M2 Browning.  And Stewart was in the rear, covering our backs with his Thompson at the ready.It was quiet.  Too quiet.The bridge we had set out to capture was undefended, and we quickly set up a defensive position in case a German patrol stumbled upon us.The sound started as a low rumble.  We looked around, at each other, confused as to why the ground was shaking.  It got louder, and we could soon hear the sound of people yelling.  We readied our weapons, getting ready for the enemy to throw a grenade or fire a Panzerschreck.But nothing could prepare us for what happened next.A giant tide of German soldiers, all carrying trench shovels and primed Steilhandgranates in their hands, came around the corner, rushing at us screaming at the top of their lungs.We opened fire, but there were too many and we were quickly overrun.Stewart was the first to go, having gotten overzealous with his Thompson.  He had managed to push the wave of Germans back, when they surrounded him and began pummeling him to death with their shovels.  One of them, holding a grenade, charged Rook and Johannson from behind.  They never saw it coming.By now, it was only me and Peters, him firing his MG wildly at the advancing tide while I threw frag grenade after frag grenade.  And then Peters started to run out of ammo.Quickly, I rushed up to his position with a new box of ammunition, but by that time they were almost upon him.  Peters quickly pulled out his M1911 and managed to squeeze off a few shots, but it wasn't long before he too was buried under the mass of grey and black.I was cornered, back against a locked door while I blasted soldier after soldier back with my Sniper rifle.  But it was no use.  They descended upon me, swinging shovels indiscriminately at my already bruised and battered body.  They were relentless, beating me until at last, I succumbed to the darkness.As my vision blurred, they stopped screaming long enough for one of them to say something to me.Something that would shock me to the core.He said:""lol noob get rushed fggt""			"

YouTube™ Video: Analog Recommends: Day of Defeat Source 

			Views: 2,833		

			Join Trent as he tells you about one of the best FPS WWII shooters on PC that you might of missed out on! Written by Trent Video Capture and Editing by Valente		

Before the zeitgeist of perks, leveling and killstreaks consumed the multiplayer shooter market, Valve released an updated version of a successful team based World War 2 Half Life mod on their brand new engine and dubbed it Day of Defeat Source. Released in 2005, Day of Defeat was rooted in another industry fad—the world war 2 shooter. In the same year, Medal of Honor European Assault, Call of Duty 2, Brothers in Arms Road to Hill 30 and it's sequel Earned in Blood were all released. While the former games were largely single player story driven affairs, Day of Defeat Source was strictly a team based multiplayer game that distinguished itself by being extraordinarily balanced and offering phenomenal map design.  Players can enlist with either the U.S. Army or the German Wehrmacht and skirmish over capture points or attempt to arm bombs on strategic assets. Each side has six classes that utilize historic weaponry and almost every weapon sets itself apart from the opposite side's equivalent in some way. While the German's Mauser K98 is a single shot bolt action weapon that fires slower than the clip fed semi automatic Garand that the U.S. Army's rifleman class uses, it's also more powerful. Similarly, the Mauser M712 side arm carried by the German Panzerfaust units chews through enemies at close range but the M1 Carbine used by U.S. Rocket troops is far more versatile being semi automatic and highly effective at medium range. With these differences, players often built an allegiance to one army versus another based on their weapon preferences.  Each class also featured a set of quirks that required a bit of practice to master. Machine gunners couldn't effectively kill an enemy unless their gun was mounted, the recoil on these weapons is violent enough to have players staring at the sky box after pulling the trigger. This means that machine gunners are largely a defensive class along with snipers who are hopeless in mid range combat. The assault class utilizes early assault rifles which suffer from heavy recoil and are most effective when fired from a crouched position. Newcomers often favor the support class since their sub machine guns allow the kind of fast moving spray and pray tactics that modern shooter fans are accustomed to but the power and accuracy of rifle troops makes them easy prey at medium to long range where their automatic weapons are almost impotent. While it may be tempting to walk around with a rocket launcher, attempting to aim while moving is incredibly slow making players huge targets. These major differences in the play styles between classes make the experience rewarding and, in some cases, polarizing.  The six official maps offered with the game prove to be masterclasses of map design. In addition to the main lanes that take players to each objective, there are side routes that allow players to flank opponents and remove pesky snipers and machine gunners. Maps that are won by capturing all the territories feature a central capture point that requires at least two teammates to capture meaning it's impossible to go lone wolf and win a game. Uncoordinated teams will often find themselves entrenched in a bitter stalemate over these points—especially on Flash which is the most linear map of the bunch. Coordinating your teams efforts and making a big push toward an objective on multiple fronts often yields victory. It's a far cry from the lack of teamwork required by many modern shooter games. While six maps is a bit disappointing the community has stepped in to pad the play-list with hundreds of custom maps. Valve has continued to support Day of Defeat Source over the years, updating the game to include achievements and trading cards. It's mechanics are almost unrivaled almost a decade after release, in spite of the fact that the popularity of first person shooters has never abated. The aging visuals do little to hamper the thrill of rushing capture points and there are few things more satisfying than putting a bullet in an opponent's head while on the move with a K98. It's a shame that more shooters don't require the skill and cooperation demanded by Day of Defeat Source.			"

												I tried Day of Defeat: Source again recently and was expecting it to be dead. After all, the game is almost a decade old now. However, I was still able to find several populated servers at all hours of the day or night.  Old age hasn’t killed DOD:S.If anything age has worked in DOD:S’s favor. For example, it attracts an older and more mature crowd. I haven’t had to put up with as much drama or slurs from annoying prepubescent teammates as I do in more modern multiplayer shooters. Another example of age helping the DOD:S experience is how “old school” it feels. Despite the WW2 setting, DOD:S plays more like an arena shooter from the 1990s than today’s super serious military shooters. Forget aiming down iron sights. Secondary fire for most weapons throws solid punch instead. Expect to spend a lot of time zipping about, shooting dudes with crosshairs, punching them for good measure, and laughing at the exaggerated ragdoll physics. Day of Defeat: Source is not a masterpiece but it’s worth a look if you have a hankering for a shooter that isn’t too serious. "

												Day of Defeat Source is one of the better WWII titles on the market.  It is aging now, being from the HL2 era, but with a small market for WWII games there aren’t a lot of options.  The multiplayer format is good, using a capture point system.  The weaponry and combat is excellent, and holds up well.ProsGood authentic weapons Good gameplay (HL2 based)Good multiplayer formatFor an older game, the graphics aren’t awful ConsAs with other old multiplayer games the player base is very experienced and will pwn you.You may be forced to play a class you don’t enjoy.

												I played this game alot after i realised that i got it with the Valve source cd game, and i loved it almost immediatley after the really good player who made me rage left the server. But i always play this when it's christmas,The reason is that when i first discoverd this game i was sneaking up to play it at night, and thoose nights when i sat there shooting nazis, or mauling the muricans' with the oh so trustworthy shovel. I was accompanied by the warm glow from the lights in the christmas tree who stood in the room with me. And i hope i will never forget how that felt, and how i gleefully slept through the day. This feeling will always stay with me, as it comes back to me every christmas when i return to this game silently in the night sitting down to paly this game, in the company of the warm glow of christmas lights. Feeling like the thirteen year old boy i once was. And gleefully forgetting the troubles of adulthood at the moment the title screen pops up on the monitor.			"

												Day of Defeat: Source was, just like Counter-Strike: Source, an update to Valve's new Source engine. I'm not aware at all of how the original Day of Defeat fared, as I never played it, therefore I can't make a proper comparison between the two.What I can talk about though, is obviously Day of Defeat: Source, having played it quite a bit and having fun with it. The game is set in WW2, and while a lot of games are set in WW2, nowadays with the massive trend of current and near future FPSes lately, it is remarkably a refreshing change.Source obviously made the maps and models look much better than the original game. They still hold up quite well nowadays, much like Source itself in any case, so for most people there won't be much of a problem when it comes to graphical fidelity.While I don't know how the gameplay in the original DoD was like, if it was anything like CS 1.6 to CS: Source, it may have ruffled a few feathers on the original DoD community upon DoD: Source's release. Or maybe it didn't, because of the gameplay.The gameplay is most definitely this game's strong point by a long shot. There are several classes to pick from, varied enough to justify their presence in the game, and fully suit the setting, just like the various weapons you have. The shooting feels good, just like most of the FPSes in Source.Unfortunately, it suffers from not having a whole lot of variety to it, both in game modes and in maps. And by now, there are naturally also other FPSes set in WW2 that feel and play a lot better than DoD: Source. There's still a community present, so you should have no difficulties jumping into a multiplayer game however.I would get this game. It's cheap and can be an enjoyable and refreshing game experience once in a while. Plus it's a Valve game, and those come with a lot of obvious perks. (Garry's Mod models being an example) Just don't expect too much out of it.			"

												This is a good fun world war game, with a feeling of Medal of Honor and basic Valve physics (Jump crouch and somehow you go higher)Because all the old Medal Of Honor games are pretty much dead this is the next one along, and this game is good fun.I wish they would make a number two of Day Of Defeat.I loved Medal Of Honor Spearhead, and this game feels like that just has players init that is playing.Great game, great fun and worth the money and time to play.Graphics: The graphics are simple Valve game graphics with nothing special to look at, but smooth and simple to handle for any PC. (All Valve games look the same I noticed)Audio: The audio is the same as above, same sound clips in one with the added old style shooting weapons. Controls: The controls are the same as other Valve games, all the same silly jump and crouch mechanics and super easy to get used too. Would I recommend the game? Hell yes it's so much fun to play with teams and more fun with friends.			"

Product received for free
Day of Defeat: Source is my go to World War II shooter, and while it lacks any sort of singleplayer component, what it actually offers is surprisingly good. You play as either an Allied or Axis soldier and work with others on your team to accomplish specific goals, such as capturing objectives or capturing key locations. There are several classes to choose from, so everyone can hopefully find one they excel with. Visually, the game is (kinda/sorta) beautiful even these days, and the game's vibrant aesthetic style lends itself well to the Source engine that powers it. The models are pretty detailed, yet far from perfect. Moreover, the lighting of the game is actually a factor when picking your shots at other players, because it makes effective use of HDR lighting. So the light and dark colors contrast seamlessly. The weapons are also rendered quite realistically, and sound as such.Overall, this is a nice game that while being older, still has a decent playerbase and is tremendous fun. I particularly recommend this game!10/10 From Me Sweep "

												Fast paced, team oriented, objective based shooter. If your not working together with your teammates, then your not doing it right. The game still holds up even after all these years. The guns feel/sound great and the level design is fantastic. The community is suprisingly still very active, its always easy to find a 32 player server with good ping ( I play on the west coast).I hope that Valve remembers what a great franchise they have and make DoD2 or DOD:GO.

												Don't bother buying this game in 2017. It's been dead for years. What remains are about 8 servers with ""videogame is srs bsns"" roleplay nerds and other servers loaded with people idling all day to give the appearance of someone actually being there (that require 20 minutes of useless downloads so you can be tortured with Euro Pop) and stupid guidelines enforced via coding. IE: ""Wait five minutes before leaving spawn"" etc, etc. Gotta love half these servers (when you try to play on the RP nerd ones because nobody is on the other ones,) rules don't apply to those who pay X amount of money for these crap dedicated servers so they can test their crappy hacking devices and overall harass general users. They will list like thirty absurd rules as well. Seriously, don't waste your money on this♥♥♥♥♥♥ The ""glory days"" are long gone.			"

												If you are expecting a fast-paced shooter, then you're looking at the wrong game. This game requires patience and a hell of an eye if you want to be good. Do not expect that running around, guns blazing, will get you far. In fact, it will get you nowhere. Bullets are lethal, and you will die, over and over if you do not stay still, silent, and quietly pinpoint an enemy as soon as they are within your sight. I personally found it too difficult, but that doesn't mean it's bad.If you want a realistic battlefield, then I recommend it.			"

												Best game ever!!Ok, maybe its a little to much, but it is my personal favorite.Even though it is full of little flaws, it is brilliantly one of the best games that rewards true mouse ability.It is also perfectly balanced in order to allow a multitude of gaming styles, such as patient campers, kamikase runners or jedi snipers. It is a pity that most people do not see that. But the game is mercyless to the newbie. You get be tough and persistent to endure the first hours. It is a total carnage where you are going to die several times without even understanding what happened. But after this grimm beginning, you start to realise the hard facts that this gaming valhala is a much more complex world, with lots of room for subtleness, skills and wit. I hope you can see beyond this harsh learning curve and the dated ,yet, somewhat elegant, graphics. Valve should definitely work on a sequel. What a game...			"

												Have never played the original Day of Defeat so I can't compare it to this.I received Day of Defeat: Source through the Source Multiplayer bundle that came with Counter-Strike: Source, Day of Defeat: Source and Half-Life: Deathmatch back in early 2011.DoD:S is a really fun game I would recommend to anyone who likes WWII games and also likes First Person Shooters that require teamwork.In DoD:S you either play as the Allied Forces (U.S. Army) or the Axis (Wermacht) and each side has the same classes but with different weapons and equipment. The first three classes on each team allow an unrestricted amount of players to play as. The last three classes are restricted to a specific number of players. Only two people from each team can play as the Machine Gunner class. This also applies to the sniper class as this only allows two players from each team playing at any time. The last class; explosive class, allows only one player per team playing as them.Only downside is that because the game is old there is a lack of active servers but the game is still fun.			"

												This game is one of my personal favorites. Valve doesn't do a lot with it anymore, but it still holds up greatly if you are looking for a blast to the past. The graphics and combat are so good that some newer games that are made in this day and age lack mechanics this game has. A classic WWII deathmatch game that contains 6 fun classes that are available to play on the U.S. Team or the german Werhmacht Team. This game's graphics are very nice and easy on the eyes, the gameplay is smooth and quick to learn and play, the ambience and the deaths, (not to mention the combat) are fantastic and nostalgic. There are multiple gamemodes to choose from such as capturing flags or blowing up a control point. This game will always have a special place in my heart, if you would like to give it a shot for a cheap price, I guarantee you'll have a good opinion on it, and be very happy that it's in your collection.

 It's a mad dash as I run to the entrance of the apartment complex. I narrowly dodge MG shots as I sprint through the door, German shouting and loud, continuous gunfire behind me. I eagerly make my way up the stairs as friendly soldiers run down past me. Upon reaching the top floor I greet an allied sniper only to see him get shot in the face. I wait a few good seconds before I peek out one of the windows to see several nazis running towards a capture point. Lifting my M1 Garand to my sights, I carefully follow along and wait for the opportune moment to strike... *crack!* *crack!* *crack!* *PING!* 2 dead, 3 running. I excitedly reload to take the next set of shots, when all of a sudden *BOOM* A panzerschreck round blasts me out of the window to the rubble below... Welcome to Day of Defeat: Source, a game where you will die often and love every second of it. There are many, many first-person shooters today, so much so that's it's a genre I'm beginning to feel fatigue for. But I can still appreciate when someone does it right. Make no mistake, DoD:S does it right. Guns feel heavy and real, gunshots have force and weight, and gunfights feel fair and rewarding. Every kill is earned here; there are no cheap weapons or exploits. Just you and your mouse. All the maps are paced great and feel distinct. The weapon choice is historically accurate and the guns really do feel like their real-world counterparts. Few shooters reach this level of polish and balance and I feel the need to call that out specifically. You might get this game and hate it at first cause everyone is accurate and quick and you can't seem to hit anything. But give it a week and start to get skilled and you'll understand the appeal of this bare-bones, good-time, heavy-hitting WWII FPS			"

												If you are a WW2 fan or you love hardcore shooters, this game is for you. Its a way different approach than say, Counter Strike. (You can't compare them and that's not what i'm going to do)You have 1 gamemode, it involves around capturing flags. There are two teams, the Americans are Germans. Both teams are treated equally (which is awesome, its not like the americans are the good guys and the nazis stupid germans that scream like a girl) and have six classes each with their own sets of weapons. Each class has a ranged attack, melee and explosives (grenades). Most of the classes get a backup pistol with them.The classes are: (German equipment first, the American and then what they share)- Rifleman (Mauser Kar89k, M1 Garand and rifle grenades) Has the ability to use ironsights and focuses on long-range combat.- Assault (MP40 and M1A1 Thompson, a smoke grenade and a frag grenade) For CQB.- Support (STG-44/MP-44 and B.A.R, 2 frag grenades) For mid and close range and surpressive fire.- Sniper (Kar98K Scoped and the M1903 Springfield Scoped). No grenades. For long range and to take out classes like other snipers and machinegunners.- Machinegunner (MG-42 and Browning M1919A4 (I think)) No grenades. Anti sniper, anti machinegunner and to take out large groups of enemies. Must be deployed using the bipod to shoot accurately. (hipfire not advised lol)- Rocket (not the rocket itself, the class) Uses a Panzershreck and M1 Bazooka. As a secondary you get the Mauser C96 or M1 Carbine (my fav). Anti Sniper and machinegunner.The classes all have the same health and speed. You die fast (in 1-3 shots, always 1 shot headshot) and rushing is not advised. The game is extremely faced paced and competitive. You need to work together as a team, use your microphone or voice commands to communicate. The voice commands are awesome and well voiced. Besides that you have the option to go prone (using Z as default I think) This greatly reduced recoil and makes you harder to hit. The disadvantage of it is that when to go prone or out of prone you holster your weapon for 1-2 seconds. I've died many times of this. You get used to it after a while, though. Another option is to sprint. There is a stamina bar that lets you sprint for a few seconds. You cannot shoot while sprinting. In the realism modes, when you get shot in your arm, you drop your primary weapon. A pretty neat feature, but annoying at the same time.The gunplay itself it pretty well done, it has the same feature as Counter Strike when you are standing still, you accuracy with the most guns is near perfect and when you are moving your accuracy decreases. Almost all the guns have massive recoil, and I mean massive, it takes a lot of skill to master.The base game comes with a lot of maps and many custom maps too which I don't care about. The stock maps are good and have cool shortcuts and offer a lot of replay value.There is no singleplayer unless you download a bot mod, which I haven't tried. There are plenty of multiplayer servers to choose from.The servers mostly consist of 32 player slots, which means 16 vs 16 players.For active servers DON'T use the serverbrowser, its broken, use Gametracker to locate servers instead. The EdgeGamers servers are pretty good, their clan is EgO (I think). These servers have all the realism settings turned off and have a medic mod that lets you call a medic by typing !medic in the chat. I advise binding this to a key. The medic only heals when your health is below 25 HP (that is when the healthbar turns red). Ping isn't a problem really, but above 150 ping the game becomes unplayable (no♥♥♥♥♥♥sherlock)There are a lot of realism servers too, but its your choice on what to play.Community is awesome and mostly mature players. There are daily around 900-1100 players online across all regions.The game runs almost on every system, I have no problems with it really, and I have a low end PC.What I hate about Day of Defeat is the constant explosive spam. Grenades deal massive damage and get spammed mostly in doorways and passages. You have the option to throw the grenades back, but this is hard to do. Best to counter the spam is to flank the enemy.Do I recommend it? Heck yes!TL:DR: great game I advise you buy it, its worth the full price or wait for steam sale and buy the Valve multiplayer pack. Same price and comes with CSS. (For Gmod textures lol)			"

												The player can choose one of 6 avaible classes to play. Each class offers a set of weapons, which can be exchanged on the battlefield. This enables an easy entry to the game but some weapons like the Rifleman are harder to play. I like this class because it offers a weapon type which has a high damage output like a sniper rifle but is still playable with a crosshair.After all those hours and years I still come back every now and then to play it again. I can recommend it to player who like a WW2 shooter setting and are familar with Source Engine Games.			"

												Day of Defeat: Source is hands-down one of the very best oldschool fps games on the market. There's a reason why after 7 years this game still carries a vast legion of steadfast followers. Counterstrike source construction set in the brutal timeframe of WWII. Gameplay consists of 50% combat skill in its purest form- game sense, aim, spray control, self preservation, and utlizing special classes (sniper, machinegun, rocket); coupled with 50% down and dirty teamwork to capture flags, demolish artillery placements, and win the round. You can run a 50:1 kdr, but it's certainly not going to win you the game. Just the same, you could be sitting on a kdr of 5-50 and still crown the leaderboard for getting in there and capping flags for your team. No single player mode in this one- if you want to be the best, you're gonna have to do it together. Highly, highly recommended.			"

												I've never played this game in its heyday, so I can't comment on whether it used to be good or not. However, in its current state of relative obscurity, I would not recommend this, especially to newcomers. People who are good at this game (presumably veterans) seem to be fairly rude and not very helpful; the elitism is strong with this community. There are more grenades than World at War. It feels kind of spray-and-pray-ish to me (although I am a novice so I'm probably wrong). The recoil is crazy on the guns, which I guess is more of a nitpick than anything, but it's annoying. I think the biggest problem is simply that it gets no love, which at this point it will probably never get, and that leaves it in this state of obscurity.			"

Smooth and simple graphics.It is only 10 bucks in sale time it drops to 5 so it should be in your archive. ;Also it has VAC system that perminantly bans the cheaters so you should not worry about cheaters or hackers.Before I forget also people make too many custom maps to play. But I prefer Normandy ofc.Maybe this game will quench your trust of WW II shooter.Anyways it is worth a try.GL HF			"

												Day of Defeat is probably the best WW:II tactical game on PC, it's combat is fast-paced but can be slow at times, the range of different weapons and abilities makes the game always changing another great thing about the game is even after a couple years of being out the community is still playing it. Also the maps are some of the best WWII themed maps I have ever seen.Pros:Skill based.Alot of maps.Great design of everything.For a game of it's age it's graphics are quite good.Not that many bugs/gltiches.Authentic WWII feeling.Cons:People will normally take MG and Sniper which is quite annoying.Not many Aus servers.People normally don't play for objective.Most servers are 24/7. (Only one map EVER)Conclusion: This game is quite fun and very cheap so if you and some friends are thinking of playing something old I'd pick this up.Overall Rating 8.3/10			"

												There aren't too many successful multiplayer games in general, meaning ANY game that has multiplayer, that kept me coming back for simple endless fun. DoDS is one of them. I don't know the date of this game when it came out, but there are STILL servers that are full with 32 people. It's 2017 and I wanna say this game has been out for easily 7 years, possibly 10 or near it. It's just a great game. I won't go into detail, but the overall gameplay and community have kept me playing since I was 15, and I'm not 24. It's a bitter sweet transition from DoDS to Days of War, which is coming out on Steam on 1/26/17. I'll hate to see this game slowly fade, but it won't ever fail. I like to ask a retorical question, ""When's the last time developers made a game that was just fun for you?"" If I could make a category, label it ""Game that is 100% fun"" DoDS would be in that category. This game easily brought me over to being a PC player over a console player. Well it was definitely just ONE of the games that did. If you haven't purchased this game you need to. It'll still be alive for a few more years. Dang man, I mean... Half Life 2 Deathmatch still has full servers sometimes. If I could sum this game up in one sentence... This is one FPS game in only a handful that keep players satisfied, and wanting more at the same time.			"

												This game is quite old and dated. Many servers are dead or non-functioning. I recommend the Devildogs server on the map omaha. I would highly recomend to stay away from the (27/7) clans server snowbridge. they are very rude and have been know to ban for no reason and refuse to appeal even after one has been filed and reviewed.

												Not suprisingly the community in DOD:S is more active than that in the original game. There are several improvements brought in by the source engine. The essence of multiplayer from the first game is well-kept, and maps are amazing.The PC requirements are not very demanding so it would run well even in laptops with integrated gpu. I am running mine in 1920x1080 without fps problems.After many years it is still a great game and with a compact active community.			"

												In light of the low purchase price, worth a play!Despite the historical setting, it's definitely not attempting to be realistic or historic at all.  The performance, availability, and use of weapons is heavily adjusted for ""play balance"" rather than realism.For example, although the real M1 Garand and Mauser 98K would have had very similar performance, in terms of ability to wound/kill with a single shot, in game the 98K has been made quite easy to score one-shot kills and the Garand seems to typically require two shots to offset it's rate of fire.Every ""Rifleman"" also seems to be a grenadier, with a rifle grenade launcher and for some odd reason without hand grenades.  This deprives the German rifleman of his signature ""potato masher"" grenades.Pistols are far too common, and for some odd reason seem to do more damage per shot than the SMGs, which is exactly opposite of reality.The BAR is frequently used as more of a heavy assault rifle than an LMG as it properly should be.  The StG-44 on the other hand has been given extra recoil in order to make it into some kind of ""German BAR"", when in fact this is completely wrong.  It was the first assault rifle, and should combine the lethality of a rifle like the Mauser or Garand with the low recoil of an SMG like the Thompson or MP-40.  It really should be easy to use, incredibly deadly, and also incredibly rare.The G-43/K-43 semi-automatic rifle that the Germans fielded is completely missing, and the Bazooka and Panzerschreck, which would have been far too valuable to waste against infantry targets, are used as if they were primarily an anti-personnell weapon.In other words, there's no realism, so don't look for it.But when it's on sale for $2, it's an OK buy.

												If you look at the release date for this game July 12, 2010, you'll know it's not true. Released on Sept 26, 2005 this was a great alternative to CS:S. Which I played for many years before DOD:S. This game had something different to offer than other fps games at the time. You picked classes and also allowed you to respawn, which offered continuous gameplay.In it's hay day this game was a blast, especially for competitive league players. However this game has lost it's magic and has died. I have played this game for many many years and have 2 accounts with a combined total of 2,763 hours, I have played in many different competitive leagues, on different teams and also had my own team at one point.Out of all the fps games I've ever played (since Wolfenstein 3D, 1992) this game I have always felt discriminated against for being legitimately good. Over 75 public server perma bans, hence the 2nd account.I am not trying to gloat or brag, this is a big issue for almost every league player. Unit and clan public server admins would pretty much just ban me without notice or call me hacker/cheater than perma ban me. I would even use my 2nd account with another name and had to actually hold myself back due to threat of being banned... I just always felt this saltyness from certain servers.I have in the past uninstalled this game, due to lack of server, player and league quality.If you want to purchase an FPS game look elsewhere, this game is outdated and it's hard to find a good server to play on without mods.Plus the assault is overused and probably one the worst F$%KING weapons made by an actual human being and agreed upon to be released in a game.

												Fun, quick WWII shooter with classes, similar to TF2 (There's a machine gunner, a bazooka man, but it has several new ones like a turret gunner and rifleman) with authentic maps plus magic of creative people who've brought GunGame to this, I'd say this is a must have for people on steam if you are looking to expand their library with a fun shooter or if you like WWII games.

												Havent had the game to long but its really good. Not too many people play anymore though. You get those 10 servers that EVERYONE goes on and the rest is empty. Overall pretty good game. If you arent good with teamwork dont even bother getting it it is imperitive that you communicate.			"

												Set in the battlefields of 1944. You can play as either the Axis or Allied forces attempting to capture or defend Normandy.I love this game, it's fantastic. Pretty straight forward, however it needs more gamemodes as the regular gameplay becomes a little bit repetitive. But apart from that buy it, it's worth it.			"

												Amazing game and quite underrated in my opinion.It is like a mixture of TF2's basics with CS:GO's mechanics. The game is really fun and because of the very long rounds (they can usually last an hour, and a lot of the times, even more), you get drawn into the game. You want to help your team become victorious. It really does make it seem like in you're in some war, and I sometimes feel guilty when I have to stop playing, because I'm ""deserting"" my side.Now, if you have played it before, or you are sure that you'll like the game, it is definitely worth it. But if you're not sure if you'll like it or not, I suggest waiting until it is on sale for under $5. I got the game when the Vallve Collection Pack was going for $25, and I don't regret it from all the ""hidden gems"" I got that I normally wouldn't buy.The only disappointing thing is how there's a lack of a big community still in the game, but you'll always find a few highly dedicated servers with great people and features.Because of all this, I give it a 9/10			"

												Day of Defeat: Source is a Source-based update of the original Day of Defeat by Valve. The gameplay remains much the same, but is a little faster paced and with a smaller selection of classes and weapons. That said, DOD:S is great fun to play, provided you can find a reliable server. Unfortunately, most of the game's community has moved on to other games, leaving only a small subset of players behind. In terms of gameplay, the maps are well designed and the weapons are varied but balanced. The game has aged, but still looks acceptable. DOD:S is a worthwhile purchase if you are into arcade-like WWII shooters.			"

It has amazing graphics for a kinda old game, it makes you feel as if you are playing CS:GO which is very cool, it has a variety of classes for you to choose from, it's tons of fun and as I said earlier, it's a VALVE game!!!!!

												My gaming life has revolved around Day of Defeat after my fascination with Half-Life, the mods that came of it, and my family. My brother John (Fuzz) (I use his pseudonym because I look up to my brother and the name is catchy to me) and a few programmers at the time came up with the initial concept of DoD after my brother watched Saving Private Ryan. At an early age (8 or 9) I would watch my brother create sandbox levels within his newly created mod, Day of Defeat. My brother paved the way for Day of Defeat before his departure of the development team (focus on school and relationships) shortly before Valve purchased the mod and turned it into a Valve product. Soon after my father (Wes) (Fuzzdad) would join in on the efforts to help propel the game forward with level design. My father was a Major in the Army and a helicopter pilot for 13 years, to say he loves history is an understatement. His dedication to the game and meticulous craftsmanship of design with each level was researched, designed, tested, redesigned and re-tested for countless hours. I vividly remember walking downstairs on more than one occasion to his mancave and watching him design what is now known as dod_glider with the Hammer tool, Valve Software's map creation program for their game engine. I am grateful that my father allowed me to playtest his maps and give input. Fuzzdad went on to be a Valve-contracted level designer for dod_glider, dod_flugplatz and dod_falaise. He also created custom maps such as dod_factory and dod_Anvil (Made on Source) Fuzzdad worked directly with Matt Boone (Main Programmer for DoD/DoD:s and now works on multiple Valve games, also known as Mugsy) with game changes, community map pack releases, updates to stock maps, texture files, sounds, etc. I commend Mugsy for sticking it out as long as he did with DoD/DoD:S by helping the community and working with my father to better the game.Day of Defeat and Day of Defeat: Source are my favorite multiplayer FPS. It is evident Valve gave up on Day of Defeat: Source after Sourcefilms was tested with DoD:S (The trailers referring to specific maps like Donner) It's hard to blame Valve for lack of content or continuous updates with the game not breaking even on sales. The WW2 era FPS from the 90s and early 2000's has lost the populace favor but that doesn't mean this game is anything less than great.Do I recommend this game? Yes, yes and yes. DoD:S is a majestic game that has countless replay value and at its core is fun. It's realistic in terms of 1-2 bullet kills. While there is only one ""true"" gamemode (CTF) they also have demolition style maps, but the majority of what's left of public servers play CTF or realism. I personally wish they would release a steam workshop for the game or add gamemodes, but it would be safe to say DoD:S has lost it's prime motivation that it once had years ago. What's left of public servers is mostly realism units which you may or may not like (I personally find them more like a person trying to relive his/her military past and not fun in terms of gameplay) but you as a player might find that style of play different or fun.To conclude: Day of Defeat will always be a part of me and my future endeavours in gaming and I hope you the reader give this game a try, even if it's not in its prime anymore. It's still enjoyable to pub once in a while.I'll always have hope for a new DoD, maybe one day, maybe never, but I'll always have my memories of this great game.			"

												Perfect multiplayer fps that reqiures skill, stratergy and teamwork. The game is a great laugh sometimes and has a way of quelling any indigenous sense of nerd rage amongst the competetive player. There's nothing quite like lobbing people's obnoxious grenades back in their patient faces or going on a shovel frenzy in a building of over-secure snipers. The weapons are all remarkably flawed in their own destinctive way, which makes everything a bit nitty gritty; as a world war game should be. The classes combine better than in any other game, though I do wish people wouldn't bother shouting 'Medic!' so often. There is no medic, there is no shotgun.... wtf? I've been playing since the source version came out and just recently come back after many years to find most of the servers, mostly empty, for most of the time. I s'pose time has run it's course with this one and I would just like to say simply, gg, it's been terrific.My only real criticism was with the achievements. I'm not fussed at all about them, I just noticed a few of the progressions have a tendancy to reset to 0 and I even naded 4 people once and had the achievement for a little bit before it dissappeared mysteriously. This was the first game I ever saw achievements on, when the update came in, and probably the closest that I'll ever come to giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥- For all the days I've defeated on this one - I have to give a 10/10 ***** Felicitaions!

												Well...apparently I have to review a game to get some kind of badge or something. I've been playing DOD since the original was in Beta. I still suck at it, but I enjoy playing it. I'm bummed there are so few servers left, but games have evolved SO much since this first came out. I don't know if they'll ever try to do a mod for the Pacific Theater...That would be my only reccomendation for a resurrection of the game. Otherwise...well, I've played it since the 90's...enough said.			"

												Well, there's not much I can say about this game, except that it's quite fun. Maybe it isn't as populated as some other Valve games, but you'll always find at least 2 full servers here and there. Most of the community is kinda friendly, (Rather strict in some servers with plenty of rules), experienced, relatively small, and loyal. The gun combat is quite nice, there's plenty of game modes, lots of competitive potential, and endless community maps and mods. This game is a must have for valve/WW2 fans.The only problem is that the community is rather small, and you won't find more than a few servers with a nice ammount of players in it. And if you do, some are quite strict about their rules, so if you get banned from all of them, you're screwed, my friend.			"

												Despite Day of Defeat Source being a very old game, it still lives up to its own theme, even after all these long years, we still have avid people playing it, thats how alive and fun this WW2 first person shooter game is. I personally, would have to rate it a solid 10/10 because it was a lot of fun! Iif you dont have much space on your PC and you want a full time WW2 experience, I recommend you to buy this majestic game, Day of Defeat Source.			"

												Day of  Defeat: source is a fun WW2 shooter.This game has great maps which are very big and have actual front lines and  vantage points for sniping, The damage from the weapons  are accurate and they are balanced and none are underpowered, the recoil is decent and as i said before  the weapons  are balanced so it doesn't take for you to pump a full mag into the enemy for it to kill them. Also the weapons are  detailed and look awesome. Also this game is very challenging.I rate this game 9/10			"

												I downloaded this game last Friday cause me and my dad used to play it when I was little. Let me tell you, it has gone way down hill. Now, I do not cuss very often, nor do I ever use racial slurs. And I have been banned from about 4 of my favorite servers already. Why? Cause friendly fire is on, and people will jump in front of you, and you team kill, and then you get banned. Or, your on the mic, and say, ""oh my god"", and get kicked for using religious slurs. And no, it doesn't depend on the server. Cause one of my favorite servers, nicknamed the ""blitzreig wh*res"", banned me for team killing in a close quarters hallway with a support class. I got banned from my most favorite server because I don't know. This guy literally said, ""that's not tolerated"" and banned me. This game used to be so fun, and everyone just had a blast. Now its an uptight, strict, clan run, admin abusing embarrassment. Don't waste your ten dollars. Unless you want the WWII expirience so bad your willing to sacrafice your own fun.			"

												It's a shame a lot of people aren't playing anymore. It's a great teambased shooter that blends hearty weapons handling and frenetic pacing to offer a gameplay experience that no other Valve game is like. Great maps with thoughtful, balanced design and aesthetic, true-to-life allied and german voice call-outs, and many game modes let the player really feel like they are Running through wartorn towns, streets, fields etc.The game rewards teamwork yet still allows skillful play to shine through. Multiple and highly distinct classes top off the experience. Not os perfected as the original DoD in my opinion but this game is quite fun and can get pretty engrossing when the explosions and bullets start flying and you hear the foreign language of the enemy in the distance. If only more people were still playing. DoD needs an update/proper sequel.			"

												I believe it was in my Junior year of highschool when I was taking a Spanish class that we were tasked with creating a ""Mexican"" themed dish and bringing it to school to share with the class. Being the procrastinating and absent minded little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I was, I forgot to prepare a dish until the morning it was due. I hastily scrambled some eggs with pepper and salsa and preteneded that it was Mexican food. Of course no one wanted any and I can't blame them, so I packed up my eggs and put them in my backpack. While my pals and I were horsing around someone fell on my backpack and the eggs splattered over the inside, but I didn't really care because I was about to go home anyway.That was the last day of school before our Easter vacation which lasted about a week. I neglected to clean up the egg abomination in my backpack, and so it sat the duration of my time off from school. By some miracle I didn't notice the smell until I was at school again, and the smell sent me into a dry-heaving spasm. People around me started saying, ""What's that smell?"". I quickly stuffed the egg-ridden backpack into my locker and ran off to class. Due to some possible divine intervention no one figured out that I was the cuplrit.			"

												The best Game ever made!Valve should really think about continuing this Series because of following reasons:1. This shooter promotes Teamplay like no other comparable title.2. The catchy gameplay and it's unique system lead to thrilling games.3. Therefor it's suitable for Pro Gaming.The only lack in this Source Title is the Weapon balancing after ""the update"". If this didn't happen, people would still be playing leagues like the ESL.But as we all know selling games wins against an active communtiy, so they would probably make a more easier weapon handling, so everyone could play this game, just like we have it now... :( If they even delevop a follow up to this nice title...P.S.: https://www.change.org/p/day-of-defeat-2 "

												It's a shame a lot of people aren't playing anymore. It's a great teambased shooter that blends hearty weapons handling and frenetic pacing to offer a gameplay experience that no other Valve game is like. Great maps with thoughtful, balanced design and aesthetic, true-to-life allied and german voice call-outs, and many game modes let the player really feel like they are Running through wartorn towns, streets, fields etc.The game rewards teamwork yet still allows skillful play to shine through. Multiple and highly distinct classes top off the experience. Not os perfected as the original DoD in my opinion but this game is quite fun and can get pretty engrossing when the explosions and bullets start flying and you hear the foreign language of the enemy in the distance. If only more people were still playing. DoD needs an update/proper sequel.			"

												I really like the game, it's very good and the only thing that (probably) is missing is the addition of bots similar to TF2 (there is an external application for adding bots thought but it would be simpler). (And also I (also) would want Valve to add/make DoD:GO (Day of Defeat: Global Offensive)(even thought it doesnt make a lot of sense...))Edit: Now when it comes to think..., DoD:GO, would actually make sense, thus I want them to make that immediatedly!

												Day of Defeat: Source is my go to World War II shooter, and while it lacks any sort of singleplayer component, what it actually offers is surprisingly good. You play as either an Allied or Axis soldier and work with others on your team to accomplish specific goals, such as capturing objectives or capturing key locations. There are several classes to choose from, so everyone can hopefully find one they excel with. Visually, the game is (kinda/sorta) beautiful even these days, and the game's vibrant aesthetic style lends itself well to the Source engine that powers it. The models are pretty detailed, yet far from perfect. Moreover, the lighting of the game is actually a factor when picking your shots at other players, because it makes effective use of HDR lighting. So the light and dark colors contrast seamlessly. The weapons are also rendered quite realistically, and sound as such.Overall, this is a nice game that while being older, still has a decent playerbase and is tremendous fun. I particularly recommend this game!			"

												Do you like cookie cutter FPS titles with overpowered unlocks at high levels that promotes quick scoping and camping, where DLCs are more inportant that the players. Well this isn't the game for you. this game rewards skill and teamwork rather than 5 year olds with overpowered AKs SCREAMING I banged you mom at you. Here are the reasons I recommend it.1. it has no leveling or unlock system so every player whether your a noob or a MLG PRO GAMER you will be using the same guns.2. maps are well designed and feel authentic (all take place in France so sadly you can't fight in Russia or Germany).3. I got this game for free but I feel that $9.99 for a FPS is a great steal.4. This game will run on just about anything for expamle I have a 1 ghz motherboard, and 8 gigs of ram and I can run this thing on high graghics and get 30-40 frames.5. Theres no DLC all content is on the game.6. The weapons are feel so authentic and fun to shoot I still can't get anough of the garand ping.7. There are still servers tho most are modded (I play on a server called DoD AXl)8. The classes all serve a perpose to the team's survival9. There are very little bugs and glitchs10.

												This game is ok, it depends on when it's balanced, or when your whole entire team is bots. And I've got to say, the bots are not the best. They stand in front of enemies and don't shoot, or do a moonwalk backwards into the battle field and get shot. The game is kind of dead too. Graphics are ok. I just didn't feel that it was a good simulation of WWIII. Watching countless moonwalking soldiers go into the battlefield just to be shot. DoD 2 or something might be nice. Valve won't repeat their same mistakes again, right?			"

												I was playing on the Wehrmacht side against the US alongside with my brother on dod_flash. The americans captured the middle flag and pushed us to the last 2 remaining flags. Shortly after they captured the fourth (farm) flag and we only held our spawn flag. We were on the brink of defeat because everybody in our team were dying over and over but then the two of us stood up and started to push them back. I went around the road through the farm flag and managed to capture it, killing 3 enemies along the way while my brother cleared the houses up to the middle flag. We met up in the middle , shot everyone who where trying to get there and we took it back. Then we finally received reinforcements from our team and we were ready to push the fight to the americans. Our team charged both of their flags and won the round in just over a minute. Moments like these are awesome in this game and they alone are worth playing the game.Strategy in DoD:S is more than important and it's so awesome that this FPS game even allows you to do that, ie: well selected classes, good positioned MG's and snipers, smoke grenades - all make a difference in this game. Although alot of strategy may be involved in this game, it still kinda feels like a classic FPS arcade game with good graphics and source engine which makes it play great. The only shame is that alot of people don't want to try to play as squad or a team to capture or defend flags, in most servers there are like only 3 - 4 people of total 8-10 ppl in your team who try to work together while others are in their own little worlds.Day of Defeat: Source is a great game, much better than most modern shooters in this day and age and I rate it 9/10			"

												Lets be real. Day of Defeat: Source is a old game. (2006 to be exact) It was built on Source, the engine Valve engineered for Half-Life 2, Day of Defeat: Source features amazing graphics and physical gameplay for its time back in 2006. The main object of the game is to cap all the flags and then the round is over. Most servers that you play on unless its a 24 hour server of the same map will then change after one team caps all the flags 5 times. Day of Defeat: Source is kind of like a WW2 game of Counter Strike but with this game you can respown after you die before the round is over. There has always been cool mods for this game that make you crawing back for more and more. Game mods like Left 4 Dead (DoD:S) stile, realism mod and gun game just to name a few. The game is smooth and movement at times can feel like your just floating while in movement. What keeps me interested is the fact that the game is easy to learn but hard to master. You have to learn how to compensate for recoil of every firing weapon in the game. If you are not happy with the sights that are the defalt sights you can always change them to your liking to diffrent cross hairs and diffrent colors. There are not that many set backs to the game besides that all the models are the same. However you can go on Gamebanana and download any skin you may like and change it up a bit even change the weapon skin. At times you might feel like your team is at a disadvantage because of your map postion but thats again is what keeps you into the game. The number one thing that will keep you into the game is the community. This community is very helpful with any questions you may have about the game. Just know that if you have never played Day of Defeat: Source dont expect it to be like a Call of Duty game that is easy to play. Like said before this game is easy to learn but hard to master. Before you start to play just know your going to die and die a lot but, with time and good practice you will start to become better. Dont expect it to be like a Call of Duty game that is all about how many kills you get per round but more so about just having fun with other players. Most if not all hard core Day of Defeat: Source players HATE Call of Duty and do not appreciate when little kids talk all about how Call of Duty is so much better. The game is very cheep for what you get and you will not be let down.			"

												This game is near dead and I can see why. The servers that are left are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones that play only 1 map 24/7, or they are the stupid gun game ones where the map is something out of ♥♥♥♥ing tron. The few servers that are frequently populated are fun until you get into the same old grind. The way the game goes is that there are 5 flags. Each team spawns and they charge to capture the middle. once a team has the middle they simply camp by setting up mg bipods and snipers. The riflemen run around throwing grenades as fast as they can into the enemy spawn. As the one being trapped in the spawn, you are most likely killed when you stupidly poke your head out to fire by a sniper or mg, or by a grenade as you make the short trek to the fight. There is very little fighting in the sense of one player hunting down a sniper or two soldiers going at eachother. Probably 90% of the kills ever made in this game were with grenades. The only way to get a kill without being riddled by an mg is to bounce a grenade off a wall and hope some dumb ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ steps on it. Overall this game is dying, but not dead. Like the original Day of Defeat which I also have, There will probably be players 10 years from now still playing the same map 24/7, having hundreds of hours played and millions of grenades thrown. I don't enjoy any game that does the 24/7 one map setup because I find that veteran players know everything there is to know about a map and will completely own a noob who dares to buy a game and tries to have fun in what they thought was a cool ww2 shooter. I would avoid this game unless it's on sale. I have played maybe 7 hours and I doubt I'll be playing much more. Stay away from this game and the original if you have a temper becuase if you get banned from one of the few servers left, you will not be enjoying your game much longer either.			"

												DOD:S is one of those source games that still holds up to this day, partially in fact due to the sheer amount of custom maps/mods that exist for it and are still being created for this game today. The game (obviously) is very similar in look/feel to CS:S/TF2, so you will feel right at home if you've played those games. It's WW2 based, yet with the endless amount of mods/maps online you can find yourself in many different settings. The core gameplay is a lot of fun, with plenty of different classes that use different weapons that all play a role in the game. The game averages 1,000 players every day which is plenty of servers to use. This is just one of those games everyone should own if your a fan of other source engine games like CS:S/TF2, or you just want a good cheap ""old school"" game.For $1.99 (on sale) you can't beat it.

												I sincerely enjoy the fact that this source is still alive. Kicking it back, to the old days of Half-Life multiplayer mods, this is still one that I am glad never stopped or got too ridiculous. Granted there are quite a few that I wish were still around but for most part if you enjoyed the original then you can't go wrong giving this a try.			"

												My favourite Valve multiplayer shooter. Pure, fast paced (but not too fast!) fun, maintaining the high pace/realism balance in a pleasant way. It is focused mostly on pushing the frontline from one team's base to another in order to take over the tactical points. To win, you don't really need the best aim or reflexes, you just need to be smart and think somewhat tactical. Constant spawns don't make you rage over every death, but rather keep on trying. And the game's cheap, too!			"

												I rediscovered this game at a LAN Party. We ended up playing 4 vs 4 with 1 bomb remaining to be planted for each team. 2 defended, 2 attacked. I cannot remember the last time a game made me shout, yell, kick, sweat and curse with such intesity. Some games are just made to do that, even if they have to wait for years to be discovered, and that's a quality worth praising. DOD Source will steadily, but securely, ascent to the title of 'veteran' and be worthy of hosting fabulous evenings with friends. The mechanics are simple, the objesctives of the game are clear and the imprecision of weapons make every kill a delight. An absolute surprise and a welcomed addition to the ""always lit"" games in the Steam library.			"

												Even though this game is starting to  look  rather dated, the mechanics are still great. This game is one of the most well-made and well-polished FPS-game there is. It has silky-smooth animations, rock-solid gameplay mechanics and proper, realistic sound design. This game is what we call a no-boshiet experience. It is clean, well made and solid. If you are looking for a game that offers a proper solid FPS-experience set within a realistic setting and playing with serious yet helpful people, this is the game for you. But if you are looking for a game that has plenty of deep grinding/leveling-features with killstreaks and ballistic knifes, this game is far from anything you would enjoy. If you long back to the days of when online FPS-games were pure, solid and required skill, yet don't like that kick of nostalgia, then go for Day of Defeat: Source.			"

You then have classes.There are six classes in all. You have to go through areas and fight your way to take over a checkpoint or fight to bomb a certain place. This game is very fun and there are still people that play it. The maps do a very good job in showing what a real world war two map may have looked like back then.

It would be more fun and easier to play with friends or somebody with competitive match style.밸브의 작품답게 명작이긴 하지만, 타 밸브의 작품들에 비해 사람들이 너무 줄어들어버린 게임(하프라이프 2: 데스매치 수준으로 많이 줄어든 상태). 오래된 게임인 만큼, 경험자들도 매우 많기에 공방 서버에 가서 하면 너무 어려운 나머지 빨리 지루해질테다. 아는 사람들끼리 하는거라면, 재밌는건 둘째치고, 횔씬 쉬울것이다.

You will have to use a knife if your K/D is too good cause they cant handle getting their asses handed to them. I only recommend this game cause it's one of my favourite WWII games, but if you're an Australian then I hope you have more luck with finding a server that isn't full of man babies.			"

												I found this game very entertaining and there are still plenty of servers online with a variety of official game modes and maps as well as custom made game modes and maps.Its hard to say how much time you will get out of this game as it is multiplayer only but if you enjoy it and like the use of WW2 weapon and terrain you should be able to get at least 15-20 hours out of it. That being said i really enjoyed this and clocked 60+ hours. As for the community of players that are still playing this game; not once did i play a game that had someone screaming or typing abuse to anyone on the server, People actually use their mics for tactical direction on this game rather than telling other players how poor they are etc, that being said, i may have just been lucky with the servers that i played on and the times of day. You will need to work as a team if you have any hope of playing this game without becoming cannon fodder, If you are the type of player that likes to just run in and gun as soon as round starts then this game is going to frustrate you rather quickly as you rapidly build a negative kill to death ratio. So no grabbing an MG and running and gunning the map up, your team will rely on the covering fire so that they can move up without getting slaughtered, especially seeing as most servers limit the number of a class that can be used by one team, people may get a bit miffed if you have the only mg class and you are actively trying to take flags rather that give covering fire.I defiantely recommend this game to people if they enjoy online multiplayer and and a ww2 period setting.

												Oh man. Word of advice, do not use hax in this game regardless of how uber they are. Yeah I was at the top at one point getting 20 head shots per match, knowing exactly where to aim because I could look through walls, and laughing my butt off as enemies tried to evade me using smoke grenades. Once I got vac banned though it all went downhill from their. I was no longer allowed in 98% of the servers. People who once idealized me for being the king of head shots now spit in my face. And worst of all, I am the biggest noob when I'm not high off hax. Word of advice kids, do not do hax. I've been down that road before. Yeah it may seem glamerous being unbeatable but it will catch up to you. Do right! Play fair! Say no to hax.			"

												Ok, ever heard of Counter Strike, TF2, And WWII? Well I atleast hope you know about the WWII 1942 Times in Germany well this games relates to that time in war, it's a two team war game USA Army, and Wehrmacht, Wehrmacht are German Soldiers in WWII Times. Its TF2 Because how the gameplay and team war based of the game is, its like Counter Strike, because sorta same thing it's like CSS But DoD Aka Day of Defeat. DoD:S and CSS, I hope you know what im trying to say they have ""Source"" at the end of the names or the game and its like that hard to explain how its like CSS. I reccomend this game for ages 12+ on my opinion from how it is, yes I am 12 at the time 2014 but, does that really matter unless you are the parent reading this and does not like your young daughter or son playing games that have, Blood, Violence, and WWII 1942, because in real life 1942 WWII was bad times. I hope this review helped you parents, ladies and gentleman to know more about the game before buying it.			"

												Day of Defeat:Source is an online WW2 FPS. It starting out as a Half-Life Mod is one of Valves lesser known titles. I really enjoyed this game and still do, I hope the online communtiy can get as many players as it used too. It's game that is too good to be put down, it really stands out for me. Not only does it offer strategic gameplay,intense FPS skills, and overall replaybility, but it offers a almost immersive enviroment that I've spent some of my best gaming experinces in. I don't want to see this game die, and I hope it will become popular again.			"

												DOD is one of (if not the best) Multiplayer WW2 games to date. It is rewarding, and exciting, but you have to put the work in to get the most out of it. The community of DOD is the best I have come across, next to no squeakers, good server communities, and everyone seems to know eachother. However, what might explain this is that a large number of players have been shooting nazis since the original Half-Life mod, and are incredibly good at the game. This means that it does take a fair bit of playing to get anywhere near their level, especially if you are new to Source games. Map awareness plays a big part, so it is essential to know all of the regulars. DOD plays alot like counter strike, as there are (nearly) no scopes, and spray and pray is out of the question. It is a more tactical shooter than most FPS, but is definitley also not a realism shooter. Verdict: 7.5/10TL;DR good game, you have to put the work in to get max enjoyment out of it. great but skilled community. Tactical FPS. "

												Years have passed since the first installment of Day Of Defeat, which was only a mod to Counter Strike 1.6. Day of Defeat:Souce not only has all the fun of the original DoD, but it has become a timeless classic, pretty much like a Rolex or a good bottle of Chateau Lafite Rothschild. Unlike many newer and more modern FPS, DoD:Source has a loyal fanbase and it is easy to find an online match any time of the day, any day of the week. This is way more than can be said of games like Red Orchestra 2.Forget about modern graphics: DoD:S is rustic, and takes no toll on even the more modest graphics cards. It runs well on old hardware and even IGPs. There are no visual bells and whistles, and I like it that way. The focus of the game is on playability, and once you're on a match, there is no leveling up, no buying weapons, etc. You pick your class and try your best to kill as many enemies as possible and not to get shot.I have enjoyed this game for several years, and as long as there are online servers out there, I'll be playing, no matter what new games are released. DoD:S is a classic, immortal FPS.			"

												Of all the competitive muliplayer games Valve has released on Source this one is my personal favorite. Like TF2 it's a class based team shooter with territory control based objectives. But with a more satisfying core shooting mechanics, eg not having to shoot an enemy 6 times point blank to the head, and without no long periods of waiting ala CS:S.Classes are effective based on location and situation they are in, making using the environment and controlling the situation keys to success. Teamplay is encouraged for accomplishing objectives and maintaing frontlines, not shoved down your throat ala TF2 where the wildly large differences in classes specialties means you cannot handle certain situations as your current class. The core maps are fun, but where this game really shines is in the large selection of custom maps that keep the experience fresh and challenging. To my experience the commnity that play this game are usually friendly, laid back, and great fun. - Except realism.			"

If you like Counter Strike: Source then this should also interest you, as it kinda plays like that game. Back in they day the first thing that would cross my mind when I heard ""Steam"" was Day of Defeat because it was the only game I had. I love this game mostly because what it was to me.

												This game has been around for a very long time now, and has stood the test of it well. There are many games that have fancier graphics, better meshing and textures, and.... different faces (each player has the same face for some reason) and not to mention no other branches of the Axis and Allies besides the Americans and Germans (lame, by the way... would LOVE to have some island hopping action and a playable Japanese option). And yet... this game... I keep coming back to. I have been in many Clans over the years from the AZR, PG, SoC, and currently ARP, all who have maintained this game and probably will until the next best rendition of it comes into fruition. All I can say is that this game is quite polished, VERY balanced, and offers a good range of combat action that reminds you that it IS a game, but immerses you deep into the history of the ""great war"".

												I am a long time fanboy of Day of Defeat and played it from it's early inception as a mod of Half-Life.... spent countless hours with friends playing LAN games.... this game along with Counter-Strike and BF1942 played a huge role in inspiring me and some close friends to start The Matrix Gaming Centre in 2002, which is a lan gaming centre featuring over 100 gaming systems.... but enough about that.... Pros*Easy to learn controls and within 5-10 minutes a n00bie can be well on their way to experiencing the joy of lan gaming*Overall great balance*Smooth and realistic game-play*There is no better feeling than ""Shovelling a friend or three"" Cons*Only 6 official maps, although there are plenty of community maps but it can be a bit of a pain to filter through them to find the good ones*Dwindling online player base Overall, DOD: Source is a classic fantastic WWII fps and scores 9/10 "

												Of all the competitive muliplayer games Valve has released on Source this one is my personal favorite. Like TF2 it's a class based team shooter with territory control based objectives. But with a more satisfying core shooting mechanics, eg not having to shoot an enemy 6 times point blank to the head, and without no long periods of waiting ala CS:S.Classes are effective based on location and situation they are in, making using the environment and controlling the situation keys to success. Teamplay is encouraged for accomplishing objectives and maintaing frontlines, not shoved down your throat ala TF2 where the wildly large differences in classes specialties means you cannot handle certain situations as your current class. The core maps are fun, but where this game really shines is in the large selection of custom maps that keep the experience fresh and challenging. To my experience the commnity that play this game are usually friendly, laid back, and great fun. - Except realism.			"

												Ok, ever heard of Counter Strike, TF2, And WWII? Well I atleast hope you know about the WWII 1942 Times in Germany well this games relates to that time in war, it's a two team war game USA Army, and Wehrmacht, Wehrmacht are German Soldiers in WWII Times. Its TF2 Because how the gameplay and team war based of the game is, its like Counter Strike, because sorta same thing it's like CSS But DoD Aka Day of Defeat. DoD:S and CSS, I hope you know what im trying to say they have ""Source"" at the end of the names or the game and its like that hard to explain how its like CSS. I reccomend this game for ages 12+ on my opinion from how it is, yes I am 12 at the time 2014 but, does that really matter unless you are the parent reading this and does not like your young daughter or son playing games that have, Blood, Violence, and WWII 1942, because in real life 1942 WWII was bad times. I hope this review helped you parents, ladies and gentleman to know more about the game before buying it.			"

												The original Day of Defeat was a community-made Half-Life 1 mod. This is the Source version Valve made around the time they released Team Fortress 2. A very good team-based first-person shooter, WWII-themed. Play up to 12v12 matches  on either the American or German teams, using actual weapon loadouts and fighting on maps inspired by real battles.			"

Great community, infinite replay value, fun fun fun.Started to play it in 2003 with version 1.3, then I quit when Steam came in and Valve decided to shut down the WON servers. I'm back now after 10 years and I still enjoy the game in a grazy way. In this multiplayer game you are forced to really cooperate to win a match, you'll want to speak at your microphone, you'll become friends with enemies cause you're keeping on killing each other in the most funny ways.Should I be left with just one videogame for the rest of my life, it would be Day of Defeat.

												A classic WW2 shooter done in the source engine. The much anticipated sequel from DOD on HL was a successful release, with lots of hype and a solid playerbase upon release. The game had many online competitive ladders for the years it was being played. DODS is a relatively fast paced shooter, requiring steady aim and understanding of every gun and how it feels. Although an older game now, I feel the gameplay is similar to that of COD II but with the feel of the source engine.Worth buying in the modern day, this game still holds itself as a good WW2 era shooter.

I remember back in the day when this was still regularly played, and I played Zombie mode all day and night. The game is kind of dead now, there's still a few servers, but the zombie days are over. If you like Counter Strike: Source then this should also interest you, as it kinda plays like that game. Back in they day the first thing that would cross my mind when I heard ""Steam"" was Day of Defeat because it was the only game I had. I love this game mostly because what it was to me. It still deserves credit, it's just not maybe as good as I make it out to be.			"

It puts you into the combat boots of WW2 infantry of the axis or allies in 12 awsome maps, with more than 100 unofficial maps.

You then have classes.There are six classes in all. You have to go through areas and fight your way to take over a checkpoint or fight to bomb a certain place. This game is very fun and there are still people that play it. The maps do a very good job in showing what a real world war two map may have looked like back then.

												Normally I would have enjoyed the sunshine while sitting outside the cafe sipping a glass of wine, enjoying a lazy afternoon watching people go about their daily lives.  There a small market stall selling icecream, here another selling candy, small children clustered around gazing in wonder as the candy floss machine whirred into life.But not today.  The small Italian village with its hilltop cathedral and its large centre square was strewn with debris from the allied bombing raid the night before.  The sun baked down and we baked inside our army issue boots and regulation uniform.  We didn't notice.  We had to take the town.  As we ran up the hill ready to turn the corner into the square, the Nazi machine gun post spewed death from the cathedral tower.  The first two guys died in a hail of lead.  The rooftop snipers took out two more.  Four of us left, we steeled ourselves for the assault, and with one last look at the view behind us, we charged.			"

												This game... it's so strangely fun and addicting! This game is unintentionally realistic. For example, although the guns have unrealisticly high recoil, it creates the sensation of being in an intense firefight. Combine that with balanced maps, low health and no health regeneration, you get a very fun and ""realistic"" game!			"

												DOD:S is a first-person game set in World War 2. It's a class-based shooter I should say much the same as the older GoldScr game. You can choose between the following classes:-Rifler:Both the German and US soldiers possess a different rifle which is good for long and mid range combat. The German rifles kill in one shot, but are bolt-action, the US kill in two but are faster. Both also have rifle grenades,-Assault:Has an smg - good for close range combat, apart from the usual explosive grenade also has a smoke one.-Support:Has automatic rifles good for close and mid range combat, but still useful in long range, has a massive recoil you need to compensate for, but its pretty simple since it only goes up. Has a grenade.-Sniper:Self-explanatory, good for long range, doesn't have x-rair when unscoped but can still be used in close range like a rifler would. -Machine Gunner:Has a machine gun which can deployed with a bipod and used to defend flags and other objectives. If not deployed the MG has a GIGANTIC recoil.-Rocket:Has a Rocket Launcher that mostly kills in 1 shot. Needs to be deployed to shoot, good for eliminating snipers.Some classes are better all around than others but each have their uses. There are numerous official and custom maps and its a fun game. The problems is there aren't many players. Furthermore, quite a bit of servers have dumb rules and you may as well be kicked or banned.I would recommend this game if it's on sale.			"

												DoD:S is a plenty fun game, and has no major flaws. It's a lot slower-moving and less forgiving than a lot of modern FPS games, and it handles recoil pretty heavily - you can't W+M1 and expect to do well. You have to think about what you're doing and be pretty cautious. The community is kind of small, but weirdly they're the nicest, most courteous playerbase of any online game I've ever played. I feel like this is because most of them are mild-mannered suburban dads who like history. It also feels like most of them are pretty good, like they've been playing since the game came out.Overall, it's a fun game, and while there's nothing really wrong with it, there's nothing especially great about it either - you probably won't hate the experience, but there's not much to keep you coming back either. Still, you probably won't regret picking it up, even if you just get it so you can use the textures and files for Garry's Mod. Pick it up while it's on sale.			"

												One of the best multiplayer FPS I've played...why ?-> It's fun, especially with friends-> Source engine, meaning that you can shoot through some walls and graphics are still nice-> Several classes, each has a role to play-> Weapons handling is great, you feel the recoil,  you need to ""hold"" firmly your aim when shooting in automatic-> Communuty is good, especially when people know the goal of the game; play as a team, take flags (objectives) and plant bombs or defend positions			"

												Warning: TL;DRMe and Jim run for the door. Alex is swift to follow. Towards us come a hail of bullets, and I clasp my sniper firmly in my hands. The Wehrmacht are capturing buildings to make sure their attack works. Not if we can help it. This building will remain ours. Jim picks up his SMG and aims it at the corners. Me and Alex follow behind him, as our weapons aren't suited for the close quarters. I have a sniper. He, a mount-machinegun.The explosions outside are deafening, and the enemy fire has started again. In comes a fellow american soldier with his SMG. He runs ahead of Jim in a hurry. I don't know why. He enters the next room swiftly. We hear gunfire. Then we see him fall to the ground like a puppet. We know what to do. Jim throws a grenade into the next room. We hear shouting, and then a loud explosion followed by a final scream. A german helmet lands in front of us.Me, Jim, and Alex run up the stairs. Jim guards the stairs, just like he said he would. Alex mounts his machinegun on the windowsill, and I look through the scope and look out the window.I see hell, as dozens of Wehrmacht soldiers storm houses and execute our fellow american soldiers. Alex can't watch anymore. Wehrmacht take cover as Alex mow them down. American soldiers still fighting in the streets, being shot by snipers from other buildings thank us, though many lose their lives because of the Wehrmacht. Only the ones taking complete cover still live. And yet, a large group of US forces enter the street from home base, half of them shot to death by the large force of Wehrmacht machinegunners and snipers.Suddenly, Alex just falls down, and his helmet rolls of his head. Blood oozes out through his forehead. I will never forget the shock on Jim's face, and the expression on the face of the corpse.My turn. I like through the scope and look to the windows of Nazi-occupied windows. I pass a lot of empty windows, but then I see one with a sniper. He is aiming down the scope to the streets, right at the head of an american soldier. CRACK. Fire erupts from the barrel of the sniper, and the soldier lies dead. Now the sniper is aiming at another soldier. My turn. CRACK. A bullet meets his head, and I am happy to have fired it. His helmet flies off. I now look to the streets. A group of Wehrmacht are taking cover behind the remnants of a wall, one of them being a machinegunner, firing hundreds of bullets per second. CRACK. His gun stops shooting, and while the gunner hits the ground, the group look for me. I get down to hide, but It's too late. One of them saw me, and now shouts ""Scharfschütze!""A loud BANG erupts, and the oddly loud noise of a swish hits me. I realize what happened. A german must have fired a Panzerschrek towards me. I yell at Jim to take cover, and then a rocket hits the wall next to the window. I go deaf for a moment. Then I hear German soldier yelling at eachother below me. Jim looks at me with the face he makes when he is scared. Then he looks back down the stairs.German boots hit the ground. Sweat runs off the palms of both of us. I try telling him we need to parachute out the window, to escape, but Jim refuses. ""Stick to the plan,"" he says. Then he starts firing.I can tell he's having trouble with the recoil, because soon the bullets go further up, and a Nazi has a chance to aim at him and...The Wehrmacht soldier pulls the trigger. Jim stops shooting. Jim just looks at the ground. Then a great red puddle forms beneath him. Jim is dead. Alex is dead. That american soldier we just met. Dead. I have two choices. Jump out the window, or avenge Jim (or die trying). Second option sounds appealing. I will never bow down to this tyranny. I am a soldier, and I will fight it.I approach the stairs. I know I am going to die. I know we are going to lose this battle. But to me, that doesn't matter. I will be together with my brothers, and every day of defeat, is another chance at victory.			"

												Normally I would have enjoyed the sunshine while sitting outside the cafe sipping a glass of wine, enjoying a lazy afternoon watching people go about their daily lives.  There a small market stall selling icecream, here another selling candy, small children clustered around gazing in wonder as the candy floss machine whirred into life.But not today.  The small Italian village with its hilltop cathedral and its large centre square was strewn with debris from the allied bombing raid the night before.  The sun baked down and we baked inside our army issue boots and regulation uniform.  We didn't notice.  We had to take the town.  As we ran up the hill ready to turn the corner into the square, the Nazi machine gun post spewed death from the cathedral tower.  The first two guys died in a hail of lead.  The rooftop snipers took out two more.  Four of us left, we steeled ourselves for the assault, and with one last look at the view behind us, we charged.			"

Really Nice game better than I thought it would be when I bought It !Positive Aspects:-Decent Graphics-Challenging-Alive and active community (When you launch the game there is between 1300 and 1700 people playing it)-Excellent Game for people who play and enjoy other source engine games such as Team fortress 2 (Dod Source has 9 classes like TF2) and Counter-Strike titles -Fast Paced ShooterPositive and Negative:-The game isnt a WWII simulator like Red Orchestra , so don´t buy this if you are looking for a simulator , but unlike Red orchestra , Dod Source is much easier and you will get used to the game quickly .Negative:-Team Balance : Servers with bots , will sometimes result in teams almost filled with bots only , against teams with lots of players and few bots.-Bots are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in some ways , they head into battlefield and middle points of maps like crazy , and get shot easily , BUT they can be headed for one direction but if you are behind them , the bots Will turn really quickly and kill you , neither a good player nor a Noob would do that like they do! (Not joking , here´s a good reason for you to buy the game to check it yourselves :D )All in All , I really recommend such a great First Person Shooter!Final Verdict: 9/10 "

A remake of the mod. It features 6 classes, and teamwork is needed to win any round. There are modes similar to TF2 with having to cap the controlpoints/flags, there is also a search & destroy type mode where one team needs to blow up 3 points, while the other side defends. There is many servers with a decent amount of players. Other then the constant grenade spam on most maps I give this an 8/10			"

												Pros- Small but friendly community.- Not hard to find a populated server, especially in the EU- Pretty realistic gun mechanics. (Except Lmg's which are broken)- Alot of custom map servers.- Graphics look good still.Cons- LMG's are broken, when mounted they are almost as accurate as a rifle, they do a ton of damage, and there is no damage fall-off for the bullets, so sometimes you will be sniped across the map by a LMG.- Very small map pool. Only 9 official maps, so it wont take you long to master them all. But we have custom map servers to remedy that.- Snipers are like AWP's in CS, they do 1-shot-kills on head and body shots, so some maps you really need assault classes to smoke them.- It's not the best WW2 shooter. If you want a WW2 game that is more casual go to Call of Duty 3 or World at War, but if you want a more realistic WW2 game then go to Heroes and Generals. It trys to be like a middle ground between casual and tactical shooters, but CS in my opinon does that better. Not saying its bad, but its kinda weird in alot of aspects.8/10			"

												To get to the point,this is a great multiplayer WWII shooter.Sadly,this game was abandoned by valve shortly after release,so dont expect updates or new maps.Setting:In DOD:S  you are placed in WWII as either a Nazi or American soldier.Most official maps are based around actual historical events but dont expect to be storming a beach on D-day <--- (turn out there is a community made map for that.  9/10Maps:The game comes with 10 offical maps but most servers only play the popular ones.I cant really say the map design is good,but i cant say its bad either.Its usually whoever gets to the middle point first that wins the round.Basically,if your team has the advantage,they'll keep the advantage (but on rare occasions the match can turn around).      8/10Weapons:This game comes with your average WWII guns,ranging from a colt 45. to a panzershriek (probly didnt spell that right).Each team has 6 different classes,all of which have different weapons.For the most part,the teams have the same weapons,except for a few difference such as rate of fire or damage.All of the weapons do have a great,punchy feel to them,and are satisfying to use.   9/10Graphics:Obviously this game isnt going to be too visually impressive since its over a decade old and is made on the source engine.However,the maps and player models have enough detail to keep it  easy on the eyes.The guns obviously have the best models though,as they are extremely detailed for a decade-old game. 7/10Gameplay:The gameplay,i must say,is extremely addicting.Its fast,smooth,and can be frantic at times.All the classes come together perfectly to make a fun experience (except that damn machine gunner). 9/10Community:Once when i was on the nazi team,we all stayed in spawn and let the enemy take all but one of the control points.After waiting for around 5 minutes,we all screamed and spammed ""BLITZKREIG"" and rushed out,destroying everything in our way.We won the match. 10/10Overall:8/10 "

												Day of Defeat: Source is an old frills-free WWII multiplayer shooter, and a remake of a Half-Life mod that saw its own separate release. It's comparable to Counter-Strike in World War II - it's more accessible and arcadey than Day of Infamy, its sort-of spiritual successor.DoD:S generally has less of everything compared to the original mod, but this provides for a more streamlined, balanced experience, not to mention a less janky one. It was used as a testbed for early Source engine technology, so it has that early Source look that's starting to become a bit retro, yet still looks good - and you get ragdoll physics as well.There is still an active community of several hundred players, although most active servers belong to 'regiment' clans that are very good at killing you and can trip you up with their realism-adding plugins. Downloading the latest version of RCBot2[sourceforge.net] will let you set up bots to play by yourself, however the setup process can be fiddly.			"

												血肉横飞的战场、完美的物理引擎、真实的 HDR特效，能使玩家身临其境，彻底体会游戏的乐趣并感悟战争对人类的摧残，让人们为了全人类的和平，时刻不能忘记二战的历史。DoD和CS的区别在于，游戏脱离了目前火爆的反恐题材，取而代之是第二次世界大战背景。玩家将扮演盟军和德军中的一名士兵，使用自己独有的技能与武器，在争夺区域、守卫海滩等多种玩法模式中，从各个角度去感受战场的残酷和生命的宝贵。每个地图都力求给玩家带来真实感，宏大的室内战场，飞机震耳欲聋的轰炸，满目的残墙断壁，敌人临死前的叫喊，仿佛我们真正置身于60年前的世界大战中。在作战方面，DoD和CS有着截然不同的规则，DoD注重的不只是团队配合精神，更重要的是地形的选择以及勇敢的牺牲精神。这样的设计使得双方进攻和防守都是平等的，不会再出现CS中因地形而导致双方不齐。任何违背DoD规则的玩家，只能用鲜血来证明自己的错误。放眼望去，DoD的出现对于《半条命》发展有着深远的影响，也再次为MOD树下了一块坚实的里程碑，它让我们学会了勇敢、果断、机智与团队合作。如果你想挑战自己，就请戴上钢盔，拿起步枪，随我一起上战场吧！DoD的地图普遍要比CS所带的地图要大很多。场景力求真实，每一个窗户后面都可能隐藏着敌人的狙击手，在某个拐角处你都可能和敌人遭遇。总的来说大部分地图对德军比较有利（最明显的是诺曼底登陆地图），其实大家都很认可这种设计，二战中的每一场战役对盟军来说都是艰苦卓绝的战斗，胜利之日本身就是来之不易的。DoD现在在很多城市大有流行的趋势，很多CS玩家纷纷转业投入了DoD的阵营，并且涌现出了很多战队，像国内最早的一支DoD战队[RED'CHINA]*战队、台湾省的GFF战队和STW战队等，大家为了一个共同的爱好走到了一起交流切磋。如果你已厌烦了警匪枪战的小场景，想体验战争的真正感受，就和我们一起拿起汤姆逊去迎接胜利之日的到来吧！为了胜利的那一天奋勇前进！！！！			"

												Awesome game, large content thanks to the large community, and after so many years, a lot of great servers are online. I think it's one of the best games here if you seek for a fast and powerful FPS.Another notable fact, even with a low config, as my 8600GTS and my Pentium, it can run with more than 120fps and still have pretty good graphics.A great game for its time, and also for now !

												With the addition of eGO servers, and a substantial fan-base, you can count on this being a pretty good-going game. Not to mention the teamwork and historically 'acurate' scenery and base-line. I say 'accurate' as with myself being an axis-history buff, there's slight discrepancies with uniform and setting e.t.c, however that's just me.If you like counter-strike (AKA Camperstrike) then this will suit you, especially when you can pick it up for £3 or so on a steam-sale. It's a tad more advanced than Counter-strike, with recoil and native commands e.t.c (German commands in German), you can definitely immerse yourself in WW2, in a more friendlier and consistently changing battlefield.

												Game can be fun at times..........Other times it you just dying either from a defective team structure, everybody is just throwing grenades everywhere , people camping with rockets or mg outside of spawn, or getting one shot killed by an enemy who just came around a corner. Also most maps favor the Germans so if your playing as the Allies your screwed.			"

												I loved it. Too bad Valve won't add additional items to it. It is memorable game. I know Valve still support updates in this game, but.. if I asked for this game to have.... it's sequel... I hope I wont get stabbed and burned by struggling fans who wants HL3 if you released DOD2.ANYWAY, to be honest with you, this game needs a remake. Don't look at CoD's world war series, we all know it's bad.			"

												Ahhh. DoDS.I have been playing the DoD series since the first version on the GoldSrc engine. (My hours say like 35 or something but its really like 500+ between the two games).No you do not have perks.No their is no kill streak rewards, --sorry.No their is no weapon/player customization.However, what you have is an absolutely perfect WW2 shooter in a world of stagnant, ugly and recycled ideas in a frozen, dead genre.What you have here are mechanics that are unrivaled. In a nutshell, the mechanics are exactly the same as CS, considering it's the same engine, meaning that most of the mechanics are the same. CS is one of the most mentally demanding games on the market as of right now, and DODS isn't any different. The difference is the fun factor. Unlike CS, you can respawn every new wave of reinforcments (1-10 secs usually), and you can sit back and snipe, you can bum-rush people with automatic weapons, or you can screw around with nades/bazookas and just blow people up. GAMEPLAY wise this game has everything. Their might not be all the perks the new games have nowadays, but all that crap is just a leveling system to keep players locked in on their non-engaging game-- isn't it?All in all, this is probably the best WW2 shooter of all time, great maps, great weapons/mechanics, good community who strive for teamwork, etc. Graphics are a LITTLE bit dated, but imo this game still looks beautiful, the HDR looks great, and on full AA at high res, this game looks fantastic honestly.I say give this game a go, this may sound crazy to some, but I give it a 10/10Enjoy this classic and keep the community alive :)			"

												Well I have been a member of DoD since before steam was even created. I have been playing half-life mods for almost 20 years now. Mainly Day of Defeat, CS and TF with a few other mods in there that are no longer around. DOD is a great fast paced game and I have developed great skills at it. I do recommend this game to anyone who likes a fast paced FPS but it is because of these new people and even the people who can never progress there skills on this game that worries me. YOU CAN BE TO GOOD FOR THIS GAME NOW! This new community is killing this game for the skilled and next generation of skilled players to come. I hate that I will say i am sorry im to good for you, I am sorry you are not as good as me, I am sorry you will never be good and will continue to remain at the lvel of skill you are at. Don't blame and accuse the better of cheating, hacking, botting or whatever other term you would like to use just because they are better then you. It especially ticks me off when I get banned all for accusations of doing either of them. I wish this game worked like the law in a way, ""innocent until proven guilty"". For all my talented and skilled players of DOD hats off to you. The ones that don't hack, bot or cheat in anyways and always get accused of it. WE ARE JUST TO GOOD AND WILL BE PUNISHED BY ACCUSATIONS OF BEING TO GOOD TO BE TRUE!			"

Those features are for insecure♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥anyway. In Day of Defeat, YOU DIE ALL THE TIME. If you want to be the victor, you need to grab your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rifle, run to cover, crouch to take steady aim, and use your ironscope like it was the fist of the north star, shoot dem piercing bullets through your enemy, pull out your nade, yell PANZERSCHRECK!!!!!! at the top of your lungs, throw it, THEN LOOK DEATH IN THE EYES, and tell it TO GO ♥♥♥♥ ITSELF. In this game, it's Axis vs Wermacht. You can be 'MURRIKA, (♥♥♥♥ YEAH) or HITLER'S PERSONAL ARMY. You also get 6 classes to choose upon. 6 CLASSES. I TOLD YOU THIS GAME WAS HARDCORE.

												The most realistic war game I have ever played in my life. The graphics just jump out at me. I can hear the people next to me gasping for air as the struggle to stay alive and get exhausted after three whole seconds of running. The despair and cold, bloody battles give you the feeling that you are actually right there; you are part of the war. The explosions and lifeless bodies fly- literally fly- out of the map. This justs shows the authentic ragdolls as they fall to the floor with a sound of a sack of wheat. It's more realistic than any other game I have ever played in my life.10/10 Would WWII RP again			"

												When I first tried this, I really didn't like it. I died over and over and didn't see much to it. However, I had just finished playing Counter Strike, a much faster game, so I thought I might have been playing it wrong.Well, I was right. This game doesn't expect you to go out and blast people like a madman. It's very strategic, expecting you to plan your movements, hide behind cover and use shortcuts and alternate paths to flank your enemies. Not too interesting yet, right? But heres what the games biggest strength is: the team play. Each class has its role, whether it's taking out snipers and machine gunners or dealing massive close range damage. You're supposed to work together in your mission,which is either planting bombs or capturing points.Combine this with a lovely WWII theme, simple but unobtrusive and pretty environments and the coolest main menu music I've heard in a game and this is a great multilayer shooter, almost feeling like a cross between Team Fortress and Counter Strike.Also this remains the only Valve game so far feature iron sights. It's quite special.			"

												The Main gamemode is like a mix of control point and territorial control from TF2 and to top it all of all of the guns have recoil like in CSGO(however you can run and shoot pretty easily and theres no weapon spread)Since you die quickly and machinegun nest are hard to take down you be fighting over one point for AlONG timeand theres other times where the enemy team completely blitzkrieg the game and wins in like 1 minute(the 1st scenario is more common)The two sides each have different weapons it could just be me but all of the german weapons (besides the assault primary) are way better than the allied counter partLike in TF2, theres no all-round best class each class/gun has their advantages and drawbacks so your team has to be well balanced to winPROS:+ well designed but hard to use weapons+very well lit maps. Theres nothing more annoying than dimmly lit maps+with a 1,000+ people every second it community isnt dead+ can run on a microwave but has old graphics+well designed maps+custom maps+ community serversCONS-no valve servers-like with most old games thers alot of veteran players out there that will destoy you-asymetrical teams-even though they look good in HL2 the ragdoll physics look goofy here-not getting a constant steam of updates like the newer valve games-small servers are really unfair; play on large servers onlyverdict: recomended game espicially on sale			"

												When I first tried this, I really didn't like it. I died over and over and didn't see much to it. However, I had just finished playing Counter Strike, a much faster game, so I thought I might have been playing it wrong.Well, I was right. This game doesn't expect you to go out and blast people like a madman. It's very strategic, expecting you to plan your movements, hide behind cover and use shortcuts and alternate paths to flank your enemies. Not too interesting yet, right? But heres what the games biggest strength is: the team play. Each class has its role, whether it's taking out snipers and machine gunners or dealing massive close range damage. You're supposed to work together in your mission,which is either planting bombs or capturing points.Combine this with a lovely WWII theme, simple but unobtrusive and pretty environments and the coolest main menu music I've heard in a game and this is a great multilayer shooter, almost feeling like a cross between Team Fortress and Counter Strike.Also this remains the only Valve game so far feature iron sights. It's quite special.			"

												I honestly think that DOD:S was a letdown. I played the original game, and it seems to play much better than this one. So many things were dropped when they remade this game, going to six classes instead of the numerous other ones. I've played this game quite a lot, and the now it seems that all of the weapons do jack sh!t. In the original DOD, when you shot someone, it hit. Seems now that you can't hit anything. How did they mess up with this? You can fire at someone with a rifle, with your sights right on them, and miss every single time. The weapons are incredibly inaccurate and really only work if you have time to line up your shot, (which normally isn't the case) or are point blank in their face, which, sometimes doesn't even work. Original DOD? You get in someone's face and shoot them, they get hit. The weapons had more weight to them and actually seemed to do something, where as the source version feel like BB guns.This seems like a bootlegged version, which is so close to being the thing they're trying to rip off, but fails miserably at some of the really important things. I don't necessarily love or hate this game, but I wouldn't recommend it.			"

Rules are simple, but gameplay is solid and very enjoyable. Community created many custom maps and mods of various types.World War II multiplayer shooter with no unnecessary features.Too bad Valve forgot about DODS (I just wish they added solid bots like the one in CSS, CSGO and TF2, but what can't be done by devs, can be done by modders :D).

OverviewDODS or Day of Defeat: Source is a Source Engine game made by Valve. It is a Class-Based FPS MMO World War II Simulator featuring the U.S. VS Wehrmacht.Pros-Looks nice for the time it was created.-Gameplay is smooth and fun.-Can't capture points unless there are two people on it.-Only a select few classes so that everybody has a role to play. Assault,Support,Sniper,Rifle-Man,Launcher-Man.-Only with certain guns you can aim down the sights. I like this, it proves challenging and teaches you to handle recoil.-Killing people is realistic, It doesn't take to long nor is it too easy to kill someone. -Shovel-I HAVE SOOOOO MUCH FPS MUHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAH-You can break a wardrobe with your bare fist.-Realistic aiming sights.Cons-Sadly, it gets boring after a while. Maybe skins and customization would give this game some life.-There are die hard real world veterans and veteran supporters in this game. Don't♥♥♥♥♥♥them off.-The community is pretty bad.-Can't play offline with bots without a mod.-Needs more game-modes.ConclusionIt's pretty fun, if want to add some spice to the game, just go to gamebanana and download some mods. I would recommend this realistic team based FPS.Day of Defeat: Source Review written by Todosur. (2/6/2017)""Nothing is forgivable.""  "

												Just buy DoD Original, Not source. This game isn't horrid it just isn't the same. If you've never played either it might be a better idea to research the differences between the two. Don't worry that you'll be losing players by going to the older one, both offer just as few populated servers. I've played a lot of DoD in my day, since the first days of the mod WAY before it was overhauled into what is known as 'original dod' / Day of Defeat on the steam store. Before the overhaul the game was basically a WW2 Team Death Match with 3 points per map. Maps were very crude. Suddenly the mod was overhauled and Valve suddenly became interested after millions of people downloaded it in only a few months, essentially it was the next counter-strike in the day and fell into the hands of valve, back then that wasn't bad.Even though it say's I have 2 hours of DoD source, I've played since launch. Out of the big source port overs (CS:Source, DoD:Source, TF2) this is definetly the crappier one in contrast to it's original. They simply nerfed it and tried to simplify it, I believe they were trying to stream line it back in the day, but honestly TF2 has more variety then this, and it didn't lose any in contrast to TF:Classic. DoD for HL1 has a lot more diversity for weapon selection, sadly in this version the Axis have very 'unforgiving' weapons that may do slightly more damage, but are horrible to control, while Allies weapons may generally do less damage but are all way more forgiving for recoil; Basically, the original gave both those 'forgiving', 'unforgiving' weapons to both teams except in a couple classes.They also completely removed the british. The US didn't fight the entire war. Any 3 year old knows that.			"

												A classic WW2 FPS for the ages. I love the original Day of Defeat, and this Source Engine overhaul is no exception compared to the original. Sure the British Army was completely removed, and certain classes and weapons were also removed, and even the fact that it was made over a decade ago, but it's still fun as hell to this day and has an amazing player base, with the community still adding on to it with things such as Gungame and working parachutes. I really hope we get a sequel at some point soon with the currently still in-development Source 2 Engine, but the possibility of this happening is slim.			"

												Heh, This game doesn't have a lot to offer. With only about 6 maps (and no trench-like ones) with only 2 sides of the war, this isn't a breath of fresh air for games. I've played for about 30 minutes, and I got bored after 5. There's just nothing special or exciting about this game. Valve has definetly noticed this and scrapped Day of Defeat (DoD) Altogether, not releasing a better version like they did for Counter-Strike: Source (CS:S) with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). I, (and probably a handful of other people) only bought this game for the Gmod textures, props and or ragdolls. I recommend not buying this game.			"

												Day of Defeat Source is a World War 2 multiplayer shooter by valve and is in the style of counter strike but will you want to play CS or this ? Day of Defeat is essiantly counter strike but set in the world war. You can choose two factions the US or the Germans and you fight it out to win. So how is this game ? This game is actually pretty fun but is no where near as fun as counter strike in my eyes but its still a very good game. Theres not much i can say cause this game is just like counter strike bu there are some diffrences. The maps are way bigger and the guns take some time getting used to. But there are a few negatives i want to talk about. Its quite difficult to find people who play on the official valve servers and not some neon filled maps (even though i kinda like those) but the biggest gripe with this game is the community. If you get on a map thats quite populated you will get kicked off for pretty much anything negative you do. Talking on the mic or playing badly will get you kicked off the server quickly. Overall Day of Defeat Source is  a really good game and without a doubt if you like MP shooters get this game right now. I give Day of Defeat Source an 8/10			"

												The only ""Day"" of ""Defeat"" here is the day you play this sorry excuse for a game. Overall, it has all the elements you might think are needed to make a fun experience: the graphics are nice, the sound is appropriately chaotic, the maps are well-designed, and the Germans sound very angry. However, this is missing the #1 thing any good World War II game needs: constant, blatant ripoffs of Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers.Somehow the developers appear to have forgotten that these two things exist, or they couldn't figure out how to hook their DVD player up to their computer in order to record lines straight out of the DVDs, but for whatever reason, this game tries to forge its own vision of World War II rather than coying Spielberg. It's tough to recover from a goof like that. Skip this game and play Call of Duty or Brothers in Arms.			"

												It may not compare to other realistic WW2 shooters, but if you thought those were a bit too slow paced and too tactical, this is definitely for you. It still requires a bit of teamwork, but the game is fast paced and action enough to not make you bored and impatient.This is kind of like Counter-Strike set in the WW2 era. Except you can respawn of course.			"

												Hello Fellow Soldiers,Welcome to World War II! This game is loads of fun! If you enjoyed Counter-Strike, you'll love this game that is practically that, although without an economy and is set in the war zones of World War II. This game is a great improvement on the original Day of Defeat in several ways and I strongly recommend purchasing this one over the older version. Great game, great communities, great classes in the World War II setting, incredible objectives, it's just a load of fun! I strongly recommend it! Come join the military!-Kyle James			"

												This game is one of the very best games that I own. Here's why!Pros:*The community is nice and promote teamwork*The Graphics are good but run well because - source....*You can play as germany or America*The weapons are evened out so that combined... all the damage that one teams guns do = the other. So maybe, for instance: The German rifle is a one shot kill, but the American rilfe is semi-automatic, making the gameplay reletively even...*No game is the sameCons:*Some players are too damned good lol*Not that many maps, but the users make some so thats cool*There really isnt anything bad other than most servers are french..*too many french people.....All in all this game sucks donkey balls. and I would shove three sharpies in my♥♥♥♥♥ LOL GGTime to MG camp ;)			"

												Congratulations! You've found a game where you can shoot other people in a WWII setting. Considering the war ended almost 60 years ago, there are relatively few places where you can shoot Nazis or shoot people AS nazis anymore. This is one of those places.And every game feels fair-ish.  That is, the winner seems to go back and forth between my team and the other team regardles of whether the team I'm on has to deal with my ineptitude.Plus, this game is like, what, $10 these days? If you're looking for a WWII shooter, this is one that works as a WWII shooter that is well worth $10.Of course, Wolfenstien: Enemy Territory is just as good and costs $0, so maybe you should get that instead.

												Valve takes quite a bit of consideration into this game. It's at its time, it's realistic (fatigue for example, because of the weight of what you carry), and it's very fun. Also, most of the game requires teamwork. Capturing areas needs more than one guy to progress. Sometimes you need to distract a sniper, so have a buddy smoke, or attract with fire. Go prone for cover, etcetera. Overall, this is a great game from Valve...""Not big surprise.""			"

												great engine design yet poorly excuted level design. I don't know who directed the level design / concept, but most official maps are simply a linear maze. You either go to A or B path. While few original maps are not bad, most maps force players to go through narrow path where hell breaks loose. Not much of open field nor free room to flank or maneuver. Everything is too dense and narrow. Feels like Counter Strike Mod. Custom maps are mostly better than the official ones. Has great potential, but rather than making more modes, they should have tried to redesign map to revive the title.			"

I love COD NOT. DOD is so much better in my opinion. Anyway, the game is great, like CSGO, but WWII. Physics are great and guns are even better. Honestly, America is way over powered in this game. Ohhh say can you see by the dawns early light.What is so prudly we hail at the twilights last gleaming.Who is brought stripes and bright stars.thank you, thank you very much.Anyway, Elvis Preseley loved this game because he love food and you character loves food because his stamina is just like a pregnant cow.Heads up, there is no scoping except for the rifles.Alright, this is a great game, but it is pretty old for the current time.You know who else is pretty old?...Gandalf. Gandalf has a beard...You know who else has a beard: Willy NelsonNelson has 6 lettersWilly Nelson has 2 eyes6 divied by 2 equals 3there are 3 sides on the Illuminati triangleTherefore, DOD is Illuminati Confirmed.Hope you like my review.

												You know... this game... I have some great memories from the original DoD, and the Source updated version kept a lot of the good things about the original. The game just feels old and clunky at this point though. That, and the fact that there aren't many people to play with / against (and those who do play are usually really, really good), can lead to it really not being fun. I'm going to have to say pass on this one, unless the release a new version, which I doubt they will do.			"

												great engine design yet poorly excuted level design. I don't know who directed the level design / concept, but most official maps are simply a linear maze. You either go to A or B path. While few original maps are not bad, most maps force players to go through narrow path where hell breaks loose. Not much of open field nor free room to flank or maneuver. Everything is too dense and narrow. Feels like Counter Strike Mod. Custom maps are mostly better than the official ones. Has great potential, but rather than making more modes, they should have tried to redesign map to revive the title.			"

												A fantastic WW2 class based FPS game. You pick a class and go after control points or destroy/defend key landmarks. The weapons tend to be innaccurate but unlike most FPS games only a few bullets will kill you regardless of whether your hit in the head or foot. You have to be constantly aware, people running in and shooting blindly will get taken down quickly. The graphics are a bit dated but they still look decent enough. Overall it's a fun WW2 FPS that requires a decent amount of skill and could use an update similar to Counter-Strike Global Offensive. But as it is right now It's still a pretty good purchase.			"

I wouldn't expect much from this one after around the 100th hour of gameplay give or take, although there are plenty of custom maps for you to try.Although this was a gem at the time of release there are better options out right now in terms of content and overall depth. as a first choice it was decent for the time period. I only wish there was a sequel made, but then again we know how that goes with Valve.

												Probably not as amazing as the Counter-Strike or Portal games, but still well worth playing. The game still has a fairly active community as there are always players on and as you would expect, community servers are always filled with friendly people (in my experience*) the weapons are all just as awkward and difficult to use as they should be. Horrible kick and recoil on most guns, the snipers are both heavy and sway a lot, even the pistols are fairly useless. But that is what makes this a great game, it re-enacts WWII almost perfectly and plays like an old fashioned basic version of TF2. There may even be a third one on the way.... ;)*I am a nice person and therefore get treated with kindness. If you are a♥♥♥♥♥♥ they won't be friendly people.			"

												Day of Defeat SourceThis game is utterly amazing!, But not enough people play it! I really urge you to stop what your doing and buy it right now! here are some reasons!The game is in a really intresting setting! having a valve multiplayer shooter in world war 2 is really cool! as it just have this really realistic tone you can't find in some of the other games, at all times I really felt as if we were fighting a team and I was just a pawn on a larger board, and that really leads me into my next point there is no other game that really has the same level of team work so here's an example if you all go different ways as random classes you will lose the other team will shatter though your defenses, however if one person on your team goes on mic and organises it you can have snipers on a roof covering one point of contest and then you could have gunners ready to jump in one the machine gunner is in postion, one example is I was playing on the snowy map Colmar and we had hit a stalemate every advance my team made was rebuked by the Germans we kept going, and they attacked vice versa it was stuck around the middle point this happened for about 45mins of intense gameplay if anything went wrong there attack would succeed then suddenly we went is at team and flooded there defences we all died save two of us and those two single handly planted the bomb and won the game.And from another perspective it really shows this game is old so the people still playing are dedicted fans so every match is full of pros but kind pros not the sort who kick you if your new (cough,cough counterstrike I am looking at you cough cough) Its a great community fan made maps are amazing especially strand! which is fighting up a beach,the classes in this game are very well made each to suite a different playstile there is the in your face assualt gunner who is always on the front line or the slightly more reserved sniper or even the heavy weapons Machine Gunner vital for holding an area!Also the atmosphere is amazing each of the maps feels like are in a war and your survival is key to success each map whether its the bombarding of shells and explosians or the brilliantly designed maps unlike any game every round feels intense and atmosperhic, But this game is great cause its not WORLD WAR 2 counterstrike, counter strike is fast and requires quick descions and reactions, this game is very slow in a good way meaning a match could be broken into phases or attack, defense and much more.This game has also aged well with slighly better Graphics than CSSOURCE and for me at least on my laptop I can see frame rates 80-100+ which makes it so smooth! and I am sure those with gaming pc there will see 300+ I could go on for ever Its an amazing game honestly so good!!and if we can get support maybe we may get A ""Day of Defeat GO""the mechanics are there with a update into Source 2 I can see this being one of the biggest multiplayer shooters If your reading this Valve you know what to do! Go Buy this game everyone!			"

												A fantastic WW2 class based FPS game. You pick a class and go after control points or destroy/defend key landmarks. The weapons tend to be innaccurate but unlike most FPS games only a few bullets will kill you regardless of whether your hit in the head or foot. You have to be constantly aware, people running in and shooting blindly will get taken down quickly. The graphics are a bit dated but they still look decent enough. Overall it's a fun WW2 FPS that requires a decent amount of skill and could use an update similar to Counter-Strike Global Offensive. But as it is right now It's still a pretty good purchase.			"

												One of the best graphic war games I have ever seen. Blood, guts, limbs, guts, explosion, blood. Everything you can think of in 1 game. I recommend this game for anyone with a high gore limit as it can make serial killers dizzy. There are blood, guts, explosions, limbs, guts and blood. Everywhere. So if you like blood, guts, explosions, limbs, guts and blood I recommend this for you, because this game is full of blood, guts, limbs, bullets, blood, explosions and guts.3/10.			"

												Day of Defeat SourceThis game is utterly amazing!, But not enough people play it! I really urge you to stop what your doing and buy it right now! here are some reasons!The game is in a really intresting setting! having a valve multiplayer shooter in world war 2 is really cool! as it just have this really realistic tone you can't find in some of the other games, at all times I really felt as if we were fighting a team and I was just a pawn on a larger board, and that really leads me into my next point there is no other game that really has the same level of team work so here's an example if you all go different ways as random classes you will lose the other team will shatter though your defenses, however if one person on your team goes on mic and organises it you can have snipers on a roof covering one point of contest and then you could have gunners ready to jump in one the machine gunner is in postion, one example is I was playing on the snowy map Colmar and we had hit a stalemate every advance my team made was rebuked by the Germans we kept going, and they attacked vice versa it was stuck around the middle point this happened for about 45mins of intense gameplay if anything went wrong there attack would succeed then suddenly we went is at team and flooded there defences we all died save two of us and those two single handly planted the bomb and won the game.And from another perspective it really shows this game is old so the people still playing are dedicted fans so every match is full of pros but kind pros not the sort who kick you if your new (cough,cough counterstrike I am looking at you cough cough) Its a great community fan made maps are amazing especially strand! which is fighting up a beach,the classes in this game are very well made each to suite a different playstile there is the in your face assualt gunner who is always on the front line or the slightly more reserved sniper or even the heavy weapons Machine Gunner vital for holding an area!Also the atmosphere is amazing each of the maps feels like are in a war and your survival is key to success each map whether its the bombarding of shells and explosians or the brilliantly designed maps unlike any game every round feels intense and atmosperhic, But this game is great cause its not WORLD WAR 2 counterstrike, counter strike is fast and requires quick descions and reactions, this game is very slow in a good way meaning a match could be broken into phases or attack, defense and much more.This game has also aged well with slighly better Graphics than CSSOURCE and for me at least on my laptop I can see frame rates 80-100+ which makes it so smooth! and I am sure those with gaming pc there will see 300+ I could go on for ever Its an amazing game honestly so good!!and if we can get support maybe we may get A ""Day of Defeat GO""the mechanics are there with a update into Source 2 I can see this being one of the biggest multiplayer shooters If your reading this Valve you know what to do!

												Halfway between CS:S & TF2 in terms of gameplay, this was a stepping stone for me into the latter.

												This game is one of the best WW2 games for PC. Let me tell you why.Unlike many other games, Day Of Defeat's community is, from what I experienced, pretty mature. Overall, most of the community is good.The graphics are good. They represent well the WW2 era. I really feel like I'm in the end of the 30's and beggining of the 40's while playing this game. The controls are well done. There's not much to say. They're good, period.In gameplay, this is a simple thing. It's a flag capture gameplay. You and your teammates must capture all the flags of the map before the other team. But it is well done too. You have many class choices. Each class has its own primary weapon. The way the guns are used feels realistic too. Oh, and the level design is very good as well.Day Of Defeat Source is yet another very good FPS made by the one and only Valve. A very good one too, just as usual. The only downside I can think of is that the community isn't as active as Counter-Strike or Team Fortress. But still, there is usually always a couple of servers that are open with players on it. So that's Day Of Defeat Source for ya. An excellent FPS. Definitely worth buying. If you enjoy Counter-Strike Global Offensive and Team Fortress 2, you will love Day of Defeat Source.  :)			"

There's no magical unlocks or level ups.You take capture points and play kind of tactically.People die real easy because it's relatively realistic.Germany STRONK.			"

												if you're a fan of the Source games then yes i would recommend this game, however i do notice some cons,The Rifleman Class:    From my experience i've notice that i can get oneshot easily by this class by other players who quickly scope in, but when i try it i noticed how slow it takes to bring up the iron sights.     i understand ""well i guess i got shot in the head"" but it doesnt seem logical how quickly the enemy can use the iron sights but i cant,      i would say that this game is bad, but Red Orchestra 2 is abit more Accurate, Fun, and is just plain better,   if you have a barely good PC that can barely run TF2 and most Gmod servers,   then you're pretty much stuck playing this game.

												Of all the Valve games I have played, this is the only one that I keep going back to.    Well balanced weapons, instead of a sniper only game (CS with AWP).  Like to run and gun?  play Assault class... cowardly sniper?  or camping Squad machine gun? Standard rifleman.  There is a gun for all styles of play.  Not one of them is over powered compared to the rest.  After years of playing, there are still full servers and plenty of people playing.  Unlike many games, this game tends to attract a more mature player base.  I almost never hear some 12 yr old screaming 'NOOB"" or any other such nonsense.  The community is friendly.I really wish that Valve would update this game, but they don't seem interested in it at all.  Its too bad, because I consider this to be Valves best game.   For its price, I highly recommend it.			"

												I have been playing this game for many years and 1000+ hours, though this account only has a few logged. I also occasionally have a server up called the Blunt Club. I was never fond of the official-looking maps but orange maps and sniper maps were my stomping ground for a good 2 year period. The WAR clan hated me because I would head-shot Cobra and all of his army wannabes and the AOD admins loved having someone providing a challenge in both clans' sniper servers. Anyways, with this history in mind I must say that this game is incredibly fun. Like most games, there are things about it that irk me such as the wonky running system, but I'm more of a face value overall kind of reviewer. In that vein, I give this game:         _->      8/10     <-_			"

												This used to be a hell of a game back in the day. However, now it's just another CoD-like game with campers behind every corner. And maybe if there was more development behind it, such as new updates and map packs, it might be less annoying. But, when you have limited maps and objectives, campers take all of the fun out of it every time. After remembering all of the fun I had with hundreds of hours I had logged years ago, I had played just a few rounds before uninstalling it and vowing never to touch this game again.			"

												After watching the trailer on the store page and reading other peoples' reviews, I thought this would be a great game to play. I was disappointed. The game's recoil mechanics rendered it almost unplayable, few servers have anybody online, the graphics and audio (on max settings) were nothing to write home about. Seriously, think twice before buying, it's not worth the ten dollars I spent.			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.i like the mg  tbh			"

												Unrealistic and impractical! From the ridiculous shell shock to the game always granting 99 damage strikes on opposition it is an utter failure. The game is also loaded with unethical server administrators on public servers whom permit cheating and are engaging in it themselves (mass-scale).  Many bind the hack to a key and toggle it when needed while masquerading as something they aren't. The developer practically encourages it by allowing loop holes and exploits in the code.  They shove this vac system out there to give noobs the illusion of protection while they cheat on the game then have the nerve to call it skill.. Talk about self esteem issues, get a life already.  I guarantee if you shove all players in one room, on one secure LAN where each system has been thoroughly inspected by someone knowledgable on the subject and also closely monitor each player during play (non-affiliated with either gamer) the outcome would be a million times different. Anyone who brags about success on a multiplayer first-person shooter game like this in a public server is a moron.			"

												Terrible, comments saying it's better then COD and CS:GO. The bad things in this game: Only germans play it so you can't talk to your team, you can't even aim, there are only 5 weapons and only 2 of them are being used, it can't even download all the maps when you install it so joining takes forever, about 8 maps in total, grenade spam, not even a tuturial so i can practise how to shoot and stuff like that,  you can buy arma 2 for the same price it's way better too, and for last, battles last for 3 minutes and for really last: terrible team balancing.

												I played the original mod for Half-Life and it was great.  It was a nice change of pace when you sick of playing Team Fortress Classic.  The sequel didn't really capture the magic of the original.  Day of Defeat: Source is a World War II first person shooting game.  It's pretty good but I never really got into it.  It doesn't help that Valve basically abandoned the game very early on.  The only thing keeping this game going are 14 year old boys who like to pretend to be Nazis for a little while.Pwninator score: 7/10			"

												The WWII concept of this game is fantastic, it is fun if you are with the right groups of people. I do recommend this  if you are into WWII shooter games and joining fictional units with power hungry individuals. If you are into things that contain:Hard core dramaFictional power hungry unitsSexismand discriminationwell...this game is the right one for you.DoDs has more drama than a group of rabid wild teenage girls and the distribution of pornography of minors is just astonishing.Other than that you will meet your friendly  no life hackers and trolls who take pictures of you, photo shop them and spread them out like the sexual diseases they have contracted. Though the best part of it is the WWII fictional pretend power hungry units where  little kids think they run the world because they have ""earned"" a fictional rank in the ""military unit"", with administrative powers that give them the abilities to rage and magically make everyone disappear from the server for  span of a couple of minutes to permanent. Females will be sadly be thrown into the front lines of various horny, sexually frustrated virgins and suffocate under the constant begging for nudes. I recommend this game to anyone who is definitely looking for a drama filled environment and looking to assimilate into the norm of power hungry, sexually frustrated, horny males of all ages who cheat on their wives, girlfriends, boyfriends etc... and have absolutely no respect for themselves.-Only happens in realism community everyone else outside of that is cool as a cucumber :D			"

												At first this game was more than what I expected... WAY more....I enjoyed this game so much for a while that It seems odd now that I would write this review, my past self would n't understand and I doubt my future self will but...This game is awful.For too long I have been♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by this game so I think it was worth justing forgetting teh fun tiems that I had and remember the thousands of times I have died to some scumbag with a sniper rifle or some bellend at bellend corner...This game is starting to give me a tumor, I can FEEL IT. It could be said that this game will killing me... I havent even played it long either like most reviewers like this, but the game just has no charm left.Nothing about this game is balanced or close to logical, I die to some scumbag or lag or some wierd game mechanic 90% of the time with the 10% being an actual, worthy kill which makes sence and isnt insanely annoying or stupid... Worse still is that all the losers that hide in scembeg corner or in a window are the ones with the most kills, no the ones who use REAL guns with recoil and reloading and stuff, only ones with mgs or rockets or a sniper or something.Overall I think you should save yourselft the money, the sleepless nights and the tumors and just dont buy this pile of fetus meatus! 9/11 would develop brain tumor agian.

You have to burst fire on almost every automatic guns and it's hard to find good servers, most of them are very laggy.

												=Old Review=RIP Day of Defeat Source.  Now, this isn't a complete ""don't buy this,"" but it's definitely not the kind of thing I'd recommend to just anyone below.  Just read, it'll make sense.I regret to inform you that this game has a very low server population.  Usually, it's down to 5 servers, none of which are full.  The most played map is an Orange map, with excessive MG and ladder camping.  Sound fun?  Didn't think so.There is an exception, of course.  You can find a Steam group that holds events for old games such as DoD:S.  Play with them.  So maybe you can't just pick it up whenever you want, but it's still worth the money if you can get into matches.TL;DR: the game itself is solid and it's a lot of fun as a WWII shooter.  It also has massive improvements over DoD, which are easily visible.  In some cases, DoD classic won't be an option, since it has quite a few compatibility issues (at least for me, it does).  However, you'll need to find a Steam group or play with friends, or you won't ever get to have fun with this game.Final verdict: 8/10, but doesn't have players.=UPDATE=So yes, I originally said ""don't get the game"" simply because it didn't have players.  While I still say you shouldn't get it unless you're willing to do a bit of setup and scheduling for matches, the servers you DO get on randomly can be a lot of fun.  On this premise and the experience I've had with the last few matches I've played (not on that orange map, thank God) have been great.Overall, maybe an 8.5/10.  Not for everyone.  You might occasionally have no server to play.			"

You have epic quickscopes every time you're sniperDon't charge in into the thick of it solo, you're handing your character a death sentence (you respawn duh its a Valve game).

												I played this game for months, if not years, when it got out. It was really really fun back in 2006. If I were to write a review then, I would have given it a 10+. But since then many games have evolved, but, unfortunatelly, Valve didn't offer any attention to this wonderful game, so, now, the community has shrinked and there's not much fun as it was in the past. Many people playing DoD:S have moved to TF2 and CS:GO, or other FPSs. A multiplayer game is fun when the community is strong. If you want to invest into a WW game, I would advise you to buy Verdun. It's in its early stages of development, but at least the community will only grow from this point forward.			"

The best WWII shooter you can get on Steam in my opinion, would have to be the RO: Darkest Hour Mod. Please Valve, revamp this game and make it exactly like it used to be.			"

The Source version doesn't feel like a vast improvement over the original game, but surprisingly you can still find an occasional populated server. I suppose if you need some basic old school WWII combat, this can fit the bill.			"

There is no suppressing fire system, meaning, if i set up an MG emplacement, and begins firing at a sniper, if i don't hit and kill him, he can quickly react and shoot me.  That makes playing MG almost impossible.  Also, playing sniper is very difficult as well.  If you even think about standing still while sniper, be prepared to get shot.  I may be expierencing a learning curve of some sort, but I didn't enjoy this game.			"

												worst game ive played you shouldnt have to pay for this sack of sh*t, glitchy as hell controls are REALLY bad and you cant control what you choose ingame it seems to think that it should forcing you to use one gun unable to change anything (not even change wepon on the options it will just give you the same thing, i tried leaving the game and rejoining but it still gave me the same weapon even after changing class loads so dont get it, if it was a free to play it would be acceptable but seeming tho you have to pay for this sh*t its not worth it....

												I can't stand this game, i liked Half life, CS, but this game is one sided, americans get lower recoil guns, a semi auto rifle vs a german bolt that doesnt always kill, this has just been a headache i can get past the no ADS (with exceptions on a couple guns) but the fact that the STG 44 jumps at a 45 degree angle after one shot is infuriating, its a hip fire run n gun acrade shooterIF YOUR A BF, ARMA, OR COD PLAYER THIS IS NOT FOR YOU!

												Although Valve has irreversibly ruined what was once a great game with novel ideas since buying Day of Defeat from the original developers, the game still maintains some level of entertainment. I have no idea how much it costs because I've always owned this game - maybe 10 dollars now? - but it's still worth it. Unfortunately, there aren't any other WW2 first person shooters anymore. I highly doubt anyone plays CoD WaW anymore and Heroes and Generals is...meh. Unless people are still playing Enemy Front.I don't know about everyone else, but basically my entire time spent playing DoD source is  similar to the life of a heroin addict. I spend all my time when I play trying to relive the glorious moments possible in the original DoD, when you could set up an MG and literally slaughter SO MANY people on the other team before you got killed - if you got killed. Unfortunately, source engine has eliminated that ability because of lighting and because of how overly accurate all guns are, but that is my quest.To go into further detail:DoD, before Valve bought it, had paratrooper maps. Paratrooper maps were CS like 1-spawn only objective-based rounds, with paratroopers - obviously. So you had excellent maps like hedgerow, and you got FG42s, and the greasegun, as well as the K43 and M1 Carbine. Valve got rid of all of that. They got rid of the British team entirely, and with them the Enfield, Bren, Sten, Webley, and their grenades. In addition, they also got rid of the Bar bipod, and the MG34. This variety is what made the game so awesome from 2000 until it was bought. One of the most absurdly ridiculous things in the game is that Valve put in RPGs, and they were there for a now non-existent purpose, yet the class and weapons remain in the game. The RPG class is just ridiculous - Allies get M1 Carbine with only 3 mags, Axis gets an automatic C96 with a stock. Both of them very good  guns in the game, especially C96. Then they can drop their RPGs and get a primary. Those classes were originally put in the game for objectve maps where you actually had to destroy building parts or other objectives with them . The modern game literally has none of those maps, yet, you can still use the class. And it's completely ridiculous - I say this as someone who likes playing that class - because you can literally run around and rocket people in the face. Snipe people with rockets.Even if you get the original DoD on Steam, you're not going to find that experience. Maybe you can find some private servers of beta DoD, if you are willing to try to look at 17 year old graphics. Nonetheless, the game is irreparably broken, and Valve hasn't done a mother ♥♥♥♥ing thing to it in literally 10 years. Over10 years. They have literally never made an actual content update. The ONE thing they ever updated was the patch that introduced film grain to spectator mode and made a few other spectator adjustments. Every single gun is royally broken, overpowered, overaccurate, over-recoiled, and the hitboxes are supremely broken. The netcode, as well, is ungodly bad. It's embarrassing that this blemish exists while other Source games are so solid like Left 4 Dead or Insurgency.If you want a WW2 game that isn't complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I suggest playing Red Orchestra 2.

												If you look at the release date for this game July 12, 2010, you'll know it's not true. Released on Sept 26, 2005 this was a great alternative to CS:S. Which I played for many years before DOD:S. This game had something different to offer than other fps games at the time. You picked classes and also allowed you to respawn, which offered continuous gameplay.In it's hay day this game was a blast, especially for competitive league players. However this game has lost it's magic and has died. I have played this game for many many years and have 2 accounts with a combined total of 2,763 hours, I have played in many different competitive leagues, on different teams and also had my own team at one point.Out of all the fps games I've ever played (since Wolfenstein 3D, 1992) this game I have always felt discriminated against for being legitimately good. Over 75 public server perma bans, hence the 2nd account.I am not trying to gloat or brag, this is a big issue for almost every league player. Unit and clan public server admins would pretty much just ban me without notice or call me hacker/cheater than perma ban me. I would even use my 2nd account with another name and had to actually hold myself back due to threat of being banned... I just always felt this saltyness from certain servers.I have in the past uninstalled this game, due to lack of server, player and league quality.If you want to purchase an FPS game look elsewhere, this game is outdated and it's hard to find a good server to play on without mods.Plus the assault is overused and probably one the worst F$%KING weapons made by an actual human being and agreed upon to be released in a game.

												Today (as is 21.06.2014) the game was on Steam Summer Sale so i decided to buy it and compare the game with Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.Pros: - graphics, congrats Valve this is done right, i personally like it- no more pros Cons:- few populated servers and if you are new to this type of game you will find it hard to grasp- campers every where on the few populated servers, making the learning experience harder and not worth the time to do it- recoil on weapons is soooooooooooooooooooooooo high, the weapons on  Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory seem to have more balance at this pointIf you find the time and adjust yourself to the recoil from the weapons maybe, just maybe, you will find some fun times. Playing Day of Defeat: Source is worse if you compare it to CS:GO or CS:S, since its better to aim lower than the center of the screen to hit a player...This is not worth the time or the money even if its on Steam Summer Sale now.

												As a game published by Valve who also published Counter Strike and Team Fortress, a WW2 shooter multiplayer shooter would seem to be quite good with good reasons to buy it, after all its Valve so it must be good right? Wrong.This game seems to lacking in technically everything that Counter Strike was great for, with it having limits to its classes, boring maps, boring gameplay, simply this game misses the hit on all good stuff.The worst part of this is that is doesn't feel like it should be a multiplayer only game and that it should be a Single Player game, there is so much in this game which somehow makes it feel like it was developed to be a Single Player game but was instead made as a Online Only game.Overall opinion is to NOT buy this game - Pros:Nice IdeasLooks Great because of its Source Engine redoCons:Limited GameplayFeels Rushed for a Valve gameShould've became a Single Player game instead.Score - 4/10			"

												A dull WWII Source engine FPS. The guns fee clunky and cumbersome, and just as in all Source games, they lack iron sights. Melee combat is strange and hard to transition to, since you can't simply snap the butt of your rifle into the enemy, and are instead required to switch to the melee inventory slot, often a trench shovel, which costs you precious seconds. The maps are bland, poorly decorated, and cramped, and the graphics are straight out of 2004. If you're looking for a good WWII shooter, stick with CoD, you'll still have more fun.			"
