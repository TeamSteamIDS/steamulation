												Gameplay-No regenerating health.-One shot, one kill difficulty. Occasionally you may get wounded.-Frag grenades have a good 20 foot kill zone.-Rocket launchers have realistic back blast that can kill/wound you and your squad.-Rockets/demo charges required to destroy armor. (Not bullets/grenades)-Objectives that require specific equipment to complete.-Missions areas are very large. Learn by trial and error.-All maps can be played in adversarial or coop modes.Graphics-Supports 1080p resolution in game. (Game menu does not)-Game says it caps out at 32fps but actually runs at 60fps.-Game is from 2001 so don't expect crazy good textures.Recommendation?If you buy this game I recommend Desert Siege and Island Thunder expansion packs since they are also on steam.Also do yourself a favor and download the Heroes Unleashed mod from here. (http://www.moddb.com/mods/heroes-unleashed)When you're all said and done the game has about 175 coop missions to play. I have no idea how many weapons.If you want to use a controller I recommend Anti-micro. (https://github.com/Ryochan7/antimicro)Highly recommend the game for any fan of the tactical FPS.			"

												It's one of the best tactical FPS shooters i've ever played, this is not your ocassional FPS like call of duty or battlefield, mostly you're gonna be on stealth on this one, why?, because one hit means on kill (unless you spend some poinds on endurance but even with that you're not gonna survive), that's right if you get shoot then your squad member is dead and you cannot revive them, almost all of the missions can be completed by just killing all of the enemy forces, but on harder difficulties you're gonna think it twice, if you're tired of call of duty and it's clones, this should be a fresh game to keep you playing FPS games, i'd say buy it, but with it's 2 expansions, Desert Siege and Island Thunder, they add more missions to the game at different locations, so it's pretty neat to get away from the occasional city and use your night vision googles on the jungle looking for the enemies			"

												We all know it was a fantastic game, so let's hit on how it holds up today. This version runs great on Windows 7 - you will be able to crank it up to resolutions like 1920x1080 and still have good performance. The controls/movement is still super fluid even today, no real CFG tweaks needed either to make this run optimally.The online built in does not work, I believe to play with other people you need to use a service such as Hamachi. As far as content, you are able to find hundreds if not thousands of custom maps/missions/mods online - giving this game really hours and hours of play time. SO, yes, Ghost Recon still holds up to this day and runs great on todays computers. Other then the pain to get online to work, it's well worth the money.			"

Whenever i play this game it gives me memories of so long ago, the gameplay is just awesome so realistic in a fun way one shot and your dead, commanding your teams, hiding in the bushes with a sniper rifle i could play this game over and over it just never seems to get old one of my favourite games of all time :)			"

												♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, do you know what you're about to buy? Do you have any idea what is this ♥♥♥♥?""B-but I've p-played Rainbow S-Six and...""Don't even start. You think Rainbow Six is the unsurpassable work of Tom Clancy's history with video-games? Guess what, you're wrong. If you buy mother♥♥♥♥ing Ghost Recon, you're in for the ride of your life. Ghost Recon is the apex of Clancy's strategy shooters. Rainbow Six series was a mere distraction.In this baby you play as a team of highly trained, combat-ready soldiers from the fictional Delta company, part of the not-so-fictional 5th Special Forces Group. Google it up, kids. These guys are so good they call themselves Ghosts, as in ""I'll kill you, your friends, your family and no one will ever know who did it"". When ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan in Georgia (the country), the Ghosts are called in to kick some russian ♥♥♥. Turns out ♥♥♥♥ has hitted the fan way harder than expected, and you get to kill ultranationalists all the way to the heart of Russia itself.Now, to the gameplay. You liked the strategy system in the Rainbow Six series? All that planing ahead, sending the teams in the exact same moment into a room full of terrorists? Well, ♥♥♥♥ that ♥♥♥♥, that's for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Ghosts get to do that in the field, as the moment call for it. Ogranize your team from anywere, anytime, and you're good to go. It feels amazing, the gameplay is quick and action-packed or slow and strategy-full, as you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wish. Wanna go in guns blazing? You go get them, champ. Wanna stealth the ♥♥♥♥ out of the stage and kill every living soul before anyone spots you? You got it. Complete all the missions the way you want, you control the whole ♥♥♥♥. And don't forget to keep as many of your guys alive as you can, since they get upgrades and become ungodly soldiers if you get them through ten or so missions.The engine is the same as the other Rainbow Six's games in the same generation, so don't expect anything out of the ordinary. Graphics are a little outdated, but who cares about graphics anyway? Right guys? Right...? Well, at least I don't. The menus look like ♥♥♥♥ on most screens these days, but the game itself supports high resolutions, so you won't cry tears of blood from watching so many edges and pixelated ♥♥♥♥. Animation on soldiers and vehicles are actually pretty great, even better than your ""next-gen"" FPSs from nowadays.Multiplayer is dead, forget about it. It was never good anyways. Trust me, I've played it when it came out and went straight back to Return to Castle Wolfenstein. The singleplayer campaing is where this ♥♥♥♥ shines.All in all, this game often gets crazy cheap on Steam Sales and is worth every cent, including Island Thunder and Desert Siege. If you are not a fifteen years old kid who can't stand ♥♥♥♥♥♥ graphics and hard, thinking-heavy gameplay, you WILL like this game.Oh, one more thing. There is only one Ghost Recon game, and it is this one. If you ever mention the sequels in front of me, you will be dead to me. That ♥♥♥♥ ain't Ghost Recon.Gameplay - 10/10Soundtrack - 10/10Graphics - 6/10Content - 8/10Challenge Level - 9/10Replayability - 4/10			"

												Although, this game System Requirements says Win2000/XP only, but it appears fine on Windows 7 onwards as it appears UbiSoft created a ""forwards compatible"" patch for newer Windows.This game is so realistic, despite the old crude ""PS2 like GFX"". Unlike most FPS Action games, however your stealth and health are far more important as a few shots will instantly kill you. But this gives you a great and realistic simulation what is like to be in a live fire zone, and you can crouch and prone to camoflage in woodlands and deserts.If you are also a real life Veteran Soldier or a Marine then you will like this game to show a bit of action - as well a bit of training!The key parts to this game to winning is stay silent, spot enemies under your radar wisely and allow your Team AI players camp in a safe distance vantage point for sniping. Also you will need to be aware of needing LAW Rockets required to blow up enemy Tanks in some missions, as those monsters can actually ice you instantly.			"

												I played this game when it was released, and I was young and stupid so I died every couple of minutes and got frustrated. Re-installed it in 2006 and oh boy, what a joy it was !► The graphics don't matter here, it's a 2001 game so you can't expect much but you can set it to high resolutions. The good thing about its graphic engine it's the way in which both the enemies and your team can blend in a huge variety of environments. It is sometimes very hard to tell an enemy from a bush for instance, forcing the player to advance slowly, recon the area with the right team member, use the binoculars or the sniper before assaulting a given objective. Despite its age the game provides you with a great variety of environments starting with open woodlands under clear sky, cities, farming areas at night, snowy mountains, foggy marshes with low visiblity ahead and so on. And if that's not enough for you there's Desert Siege and Island Thunder , the game's two add-ons, adding desert environments ( DUH ) and treacherous jungles. This kind of variety is rarely seen in most tactical shooters , making Ghost Recon a must have for any player who likes the genre. ► The A.I is also great. You may experience some pathfinding problems with some of your squad members ( especially in closed environements such as houses - they sometimes get stuck behind a table or block your way upstairs, which is annoying but it doesn't happen that often , you may even finish the game without having these problems. But then again you can control any of your squad members and get them out of the way. ) The enemies have good reactions when a firefight starts, you will see them splitting up instead of sticking together like magnets or just married couples. They will try to get behind you, they advance a little, they stop for a few moments, they go right, they go left and you cannot predict the path they will take in order to find you and kill you. So hiding behind a rock and waiting for 20 russians to pop in one by one so you can shoot them is a no-no. Even in easy difficulty you'll find it challenging ( especially if it's your first time trying this game ).► Speaking of challenging, let me say a few words about something I didn't like in this game. You can save your games. Now it might sound stupid but save game options for this genre tend to ruin the experience a little bit. It is way more rewarding to finish a mission without saving your progress, it forces you to think twice before doing something, but if you fail 30 seconds before completing the last objective then it is very frustrating to start it all over again. Saving your progress is good for players who are new to tactical shooters, but the more experienced you get the less help you want to get from the game. And speaking about help, there's a radar at the bottom of the screen telling you if there are enemies around you. It doesn't tell you the number of enemies, the small circle turns red if you're approaching an enemy ( or being approached by it ). It also tells you from which direction the gunshots are coming, which is another small cheat. The problem with these tools is that they are distracting. I sometimes get shot because I spend half a second watching my radar to check the coming direction of the gunshots. Other than that, the HUD is alright, it shows your stance, level of injuries, remaining ammo and weapon used. The remaining ammunition in the magazines is another thing that should have been removed..► Overall the gameplay is good, simple but effective. You can bring up to six Ghosts to the battle, and assign them to Alpha, Bravo and Charlie squads. This gives room for nice pre-planning, you can therefore create a recon squad equiped with silenced weapons, an assault squad carrying assault rifles ( DUH ) and a sniper squad involving the sniper himself and a teamate to protect his back. This is one example among many you can use before pressing the start button. During the mission, you also have access to a tactical map, which is actually a very basic one offering you the possibility to adopt different behaviours ( Assault - fire at will /// Recon - Don't shoot /// and so on ) . You can assign waypoints to the teams allowing you to coordinate an assault for instance. But then again, careful with that tool, if the squad you're not controlling gets stuck behind a rock... there goes you planning. The map could have been greatly improved but it hasn't been, and that's a shame. Finally, the map menu also shows where your troopers have been injured. Being shot in the leg will make the Ghost move slower or will be forced to walk, whereas  an injured arm will greatly reduce his ability to shoot accurately. The objectives you have to complete stretch from capturing a high profile colonel ( and bring it back to the base - yes, you will have to go all the way back to the insertion area so pay attention more tangos incoming !! ) , blowing up planes, clearing an old castle's courtyard, assaulting a farm and a house, destroying tanks, rescuing NATO soldiers and so on and so forth. The diversity of Ghost Recon is amazing for such an old game !► It comes with 15 singleplayer missions , which is not that much but if you buy the add-ons you'll have enough for weeks . It also has a multiplayer, which I haven't tried, yet. You can also replay the missions, trying different approaches, using different squad members such as specialists ( you can unlock them by completing side objectives and they are very valuable squad members, they come with higher skills in every domain ( stealth, weapons, command, endurance ). You can upgrade the skills of each Ghost by assigning skill points, earned at the end of each mission. I recommend to upgrade the stealth skill as much as possible, I'm just saying... As a conclusion I would say that this is one of the best tactical shooters out there, and it comes at a cheap price ! What else do you need ?			"

												My play-time is very impressive indeed.Some pros:+ Tactical Game-Play+ 16 Player Co-op+ Sensible Story & Missions   (not hollywood)+ Fairly Large Maps+ No ""Forced"" Scripted Sections   (that forces you to stand still, wait for doors etc)+ No Rail-Shooter Sections+ Easy To Give Orders & BehavioursSome cons:- Dated Graphics- Lacking Weapons Variety- Can't Use VehiclesOthers:-/+ No Outside Support   (only your squad, no airstrikes etc)-/+ No Cutscenes In-Game-/+ AI Is Only Compitent-/+ You Have No/Very Little Handicap   (like more health etc)An old, but still very good tactical game. You control a squad of elite soldiers with their own stats that will improve over time. The game has perma-death so you'll have to be careful with your veterans or else they'll be replaced by rookies.The game is also fairly hard for todays standards if you play on normal/hard. You get killed in 1-3 shots, so you must use your brain. If you survive a shot you may get penalties, like moving much slower or being easier to detect.In my experience this is an harsh game where you constantly have to think of how to make your squad survive the next mission, instead of just blowing things up 24/7. If you can look past the graphics it's a very nice tactical experience, particularily in co-op.There's a mod called ""Heroes Unleashed"" that will add more than twice as many weapons to the game, fixing the weapons variety issue.

												The original Ghost Recon is straight out of the golden age of tactical shooters. I would highly recomend this to someone that wants to play a realistic shooter without going into overly detailed mechanics and clunky interface like in the ArmA series. Great music, tense perma-death gameplay, a cool story, and ""set in reality"" setting really give this game a classic Tom Clancy feel. Go ahead and jump on this if you are tired of all the samey AAA games that have flooded the shooter market in the past few years. "

												One of the Greatest tactical shooters out there.  Command up to at least three squads on very long missions.  The game is very unforgiving at times depending on how you play through the game.  Being very ballistic and balls deep will get you killed.  Taking your time and including various stealth tactics will reward you with survival.  Beating the campaign is pretty hard, pending on what difficulty you play on.  Recruit gives you the feel of the game letting you ease in and take control, Veteran makes you think before you do and plan out your attacks, Elite harder enemies, and mission timing needs to be precise and accurate for a successful mission.  Though this game is old, the core gameplay is great.  GR's today really don't give you that scratch for being an amazing squad leader.  Going back to this game after not playing it since its release sends that great nostalgia and memories back into the brain.  Playing with friends is awesome, letting you play tactically and communicating amongst each other.  Brings back the old days, playing split-screen on the PS2 and Xbox.  This game is worth the money towards it and its DLCs.  Don't forget the large mod pack that's out.  I can't remember the link so google it if ya want :D.			"

												This is objectively the best Ghost Recon game. A completely and utterly unflinching squad tactics title with a plot that's actually good and comprehensible for a Tom Clancy game, since it's from an era where the prefix ""Tom Clancy's"" meant something.My view on military shooters is: if you're gonna play a lot of them, you might as well play some that bring home the tension of war and give you an idea of what it might actually entail. Ghost Recon is a wild success in this regard because it is raw as Hell. One shot, one kill.You don't even have any weapon viewmodels to look at; presumably because your average special forces operator has drilled enough to regard their weaponry as true extensions of themselves, not worthy of more examination than necessary to clear jams. While this is arguably a negative in the looks department, you don't really play this for the looks. There is mod support that lets you upgrade textures, sounds and other things like that if it really bothers you.Ghost Recon might need tweaking to get it to run properly, and certainly needs programs like Hamachi to play multiplayer, but if tactical wargames interest you in any way I'd absolutely recommend this and its two expansions to you.

You get shot with one bullet, you either die or get a crippled arm/leg/chest which causes you to lose good aiming in case of arm and cannot run/walk and properly if leg. If you die you will controll another soldier that you've bring with you and that dead soldier will remain dead forever trought the rest of the entire game. A.I. is very good, your squad members are not stupid and neither your enemies, even if enemies dont know where you are they'll shoot in the direction of where the shot came from in case you are camouflaged and they'll split and search for you. The game structure is also amazing, you pick the men and weapons you want divided into one to three platoons to execute a mission (you can go alone if you want, one man platoon), when playing you can control the other platoons over the map with many intuitive orders or directly change the soldier you are playing. The soldiers will get awards and medals that reflect their deeds in battle. If you end a mission with an injured soldier he will remain injured unless you let him out of the next couple missions you'll do so he can recover. The weapon sounds and soldier movements are excellent. All of these missions can be done with as many friends you want or play against each other in defensive maps.10/10 for being realistic and the only of its kind, the other ghost recons are all commercial (brainless shooters like COD and etc) and suck a lot when compared to this first one because thats what sells best. Despite being old (2001) the graphics are still good.The best tactical shooter simulator EVER.			"

Be patient, use your brain, don't worry about the old graphics, and enjoy one of the best tactical shooters ever. The two expansion packs are well worth picking up.			"

												This game is a classic. If you want one hell of a shooting game, and challenging opponents (as long as you don't put it on easy), then this game is for you. I like how realistic the game feels when you use real tactics to take down the enemy; flanking, hiding, the element of surprise, etc. This is definitely worth buying.			"

												This is the most fascinating of all Ghost Recon games. It takes place in 2006-2008 and has a wonderful storyline to flow with the intense gameplay. You feel like every single life matters in this game, that even one sacrifice will mentally effect you. I've had wonderful history with this game especially since giving little 8 year old kids an original xbox with this game is a wonderful idea. But as I played this when I was little gave me common sense believe it or not to know that a person holding a firearm is a deadly person and to not approach them or even concider conversation with them unless they're millitary ""good guys"" Anyways off topic. This game is extremely fun with a long ♥♥♥ campaign PLUS DLC which adds onto the overall rating. Also, there is mods out there to make the game even bigger and more fun. I would recommend singleplayer only on this game where I have never been able to play the multiplayer version, so if anyone wants to play message me! I love this game. After this rewiew is written I am going to go play it! Make sure your enemies know you were never here, because  Ghosts don't exist to the naked eye. Have fun everyone!			"

												Still one of the best tactical shooters of all time. Sure, it isn't flashy and doesn't have all the microstances and gadgets games like Arma 3 have. What it does have is proper pacing. You have to stop and plan out your course of action if you want to win. To keep it concise, its one of the original ""Thinking Man's Shooters"".			"

												I like Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon. The enemy AI is really smart, but the friendly AI is really stupid. There is a real-time strategy component to the tactical work. Close and long range battles are combined. This tactical first-person shooter relies heavily on the player's quick decision-making and tactical control of friendly infantry to flawlessly win the missions.			"

												Great classic. Still fun to play. Brings back lots of memories. Not complaining about the graphics.It's a one-shot-one-kill game. If you complain about the enemy AI killing you then think about this: If you were a terrorist with a weapon, wouldn't you shoot anybody on sight? And I'm assuming real-life terrorists have weapons experience, so the AI in this game should too.My only downsides: -Menu resolution (Can't be changed)-Multiplayer is not fully functional-Button mapping (takes a while changing the buttons)			"

												The short amount of time on Steam betrays the 100s of hours I've dumped in this game since its release.  Before Operation Flashpoint and its successors stole my heart, this was the defacto tactical shooter for squadron based play.  Engagements are short and furious, and the AI is omniscient in true Red Storm fashion, but if you've not partaken in the red headed stepchild of the original Tom Clancy games, you're missing out.  If you like old school tactical shooters, this and its expansions are well worth the time.			"

												Tom Clansy's owned Ghost Recon is a tactical shooter in which you get to control the squad during the mission itself while being able to take control of any of them. Yep, one of realistical tactical, where you die from one shot. It was developed by Red Storm and published in 2001, with being ported onto various consoles in following two years, that are Xbox, GameCube, PS2. And yes, it was made by same people as who made Rainbow Six few years ago, and now they were challenging players by moving action from close-range to long-range open combat. Just like Delta Force, but with fog. And squad tactics.And yes, it got two more expansion packs that you can buy on Steam as well.Technically, well, it's actually fine. Sure, game came out before widescreen monitors happened, but engine can support such resolution and allows you to select it from options. Main menu and such will stay as blocky low-resolution 4:3, but as soon as you get into gameplay, it will switch to what you set in options. FOV however will not increase, so people are still chubby.Not sure about multiplayer. Never got to playing it and Internet browser in the game itself appears as completely empty. No wind, no tumbleweeds. Perhaps server browser is broken. But as far as I am aware, it's dead. And multiplayer was the main positive point of this game, so we are left with less positive single-player.So, the plot is that in 2008 ultra-super-hyper-nationalists come to power in Russia and are now going to conquer and merge with countries that were part of USSR, starting with finding the way to take on Georgia. Funny how game predicted that in 2008 there will be conflict with Georgia and Russia, though it wasn't the one where Russia is your everyday demonized baddie. Anyway, you then go and take on various mission to kill people and do objectives, being world's judge. Until you beat final mission. And then get thrown into main menu immeditly. Because screw you, it's realistical tactical lack of ending!Graphics look kinda nice, I dig the enviroment for sure. Death animations do the job. Lack of gun in view is silly though. Music is fine, just randomly placed in main menu and then sometimes playes when somebody in your team dies.You got 15 single-players missions to complete and boy, it's not going to be easy. And it wasn't supposed to be easy. As fun as it could be. Anyway, you look at the map which doesn't tell you about verticality, then pick your platoon out of 6 members, that is divided into 3 squads, each having max to 3 people. Mind it, you can order only to whole squad, so better keep specialized people, like sniper, in separate special squad. And Demolition for enemy armor and mission objectives. And Support for having big magazine. But mostly riflemans. You can actually auto-assign people, and game handles it well, even though it never picks anybody from Specialist category. Who are powerful soldiers who may even have unique weapons.You can get Specialists by completing bonus objective. Where game can screw you up, because it ends mission as soon as either you done all main objective or if killed all enemies if last objective was moving to extraction point. That, and soldiers who died in battle will not reappear. At least they level up between each mission.And so you will run, you will walk, you will duck and crawl toward enemy, to get into position to shoot them all. Well, mostly running, otherwise you will run out of patience on these big maps covered in fog. And lean around. And notice threat indicator at the bottom of the screen showing red. And snipe enemies. Who will then run toward trees and hide and wait for a moment to lean around and put bulets into your dumb AI teammate. Who you will thankfully kill first. Until you realize that somebody threw grenade and you will be hopelessly trying to switch to each member and micro-manage them to run away. But they all die and so you restart mission as you don't want to have even less soldiers to pick in next mission.A thing to note, is the way that they did aiming thing. You see, unlike other games, the aiming will drop when you are turning around. Actually, turning around punishes you more than just walking slowly! As a result, it makes flanking more important in this game.With no planning phase for giving actual order, like in Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon lets you control team during gameplay. Just bring out the map, choose the squad, and click on a map, setting waypoint and where they are supposed to look. Then erase it and do it again, as map UI seems to be unreliably at selecting the team for some reason. But at least I prefer to be able to do it during gameplay. You can also set rules for each team, one for movement: Stop, Move but stop if being supressed, Move at any cost. And rule of engangement: Recon, shoot only if shot back, which is good for ordering troops to get into good position around enemy point. Assault, shoot accurately, sometimes, which is good when on the move and don't know where enemy is. And Supress, which makes them trigger-happy, good when you set them to defend or assault from one position.And well, now that you wonder what tactics there are, here is what to expect: Always come from unexpected side. If you need to assault inner building, then switch to soldier on one side, kill one enemy, switch to soldier on opposite side, kill another enemy and so on.As far squad tactics, well, they aren't reliable. But expect to use them to cover your flank. And sometimes to assault base while staying in one position. And moving people them around on map to get closer to objectives, so you could then control a soldier from squad, with others being like your ""lives"".Yep, AI teammates aren't reliable and soon you will feel divided. As it turns into mix of FPS action and Strategy game where you can't trust either part. Because sometimes AI can actually save you, but it's rare. Most often you will be wondering why your squad keeps being wiped out, then quickload and see person ignoring 9 sneaking soldiers, after all he is behind tree, he is INVINCIBLE!The fact that command map shows no verticality in level means you will have to manually position them anyway, often.Oh, and yes, I said quickload. Which means that there is quicksave. Which means that you can shove tactics into armor's rear and quickscam your way to the victory! No, really, Rainbow Six or Delta Force never allowed you to do it. But I guess that this cheapness counter-balances against the game's cheap difficulty where enemies can always aimbot you up. For knowledge is the main decision point in this game, and if you know what to expect, you don't need to crawl. You come in and kill all ten of them. Quickloading many times to get out from ambush.And let's be honest. Most of people who praise the game had it as the first game. And others who praise it do it because of how difficult it is. Mostly of how you can die randomly easily. And thus is somehow makes you feel better if you somehow manage to pull though. Not sure, I didn't feel anything like this, just a chore. Because well, when I died, I didn't feel that it was always fair, thus I just didn't care and reloaded a save.But I still can recommend the game. Well, not fully. Mostly above average. Because sometimes it works and makes you feel rewarded for positioning your team properly. Other times, it just screws you.Actually, when you just play some missions separately - it's a blast of trying to survive and setting good positions and tactics! Then there are some missions that feel messy and less fun. Look, stealth mission! It's just that main campaign, which makes me feel that I must be overprotective as it punishes you if your soldier dies by not having him in next missions, is where I just start to abuse quicksaves and grind it and get impatient.

												Old game but great game. better than most FPS out there because this is hard and uses TACTICS, not run ion the middle of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ firefight and kill everyhitng in sight while barely taking a scratch(IM LOOKING AT YOU COD!). not only that, but this ghame has one of the best soundtracks in a game. Peroid. close to halos music. this game is to be taken slowly you you will be killed instantly, and fear is having either no snipers, or only a sniper left to use. its a cheap cost, but i would glady pay three times the price for this game if the servers were still up(the game is from 2002, they are down), but its easly woth 20-25. the game has some epic firefights, that will make your heart oump as you try to not get hit as 1-2 rounds to the upper body WILL kill you(its called realism, again im looking at you cod..), and you try to hit the enemy instead. Thrying to keeep as most of your team alive as possible is also fun, but difficult, and extremyl rewarding as your team members  that live go one future missions woth you, and after every mission they survive, they can be upgraded. also you can ear. specialts soliders that have very powerful weapons, and must be cared for, as they can support your whole team.The best way to structure your team ive found is ALPHA TEAM: RIFLEMAN AND SUPPORTBRAVO TEAM:SNIPER AND either RIFLEMAN or demo if the misson calls for andCHARLIE TEAM: same as Bravoequip snipers with supressed pistols, and BRAVO and CHARLIE rifleman with extra ammo, and demo with either charges ot T missle, depending on the mission breifing saying tanks, or not.OVERALL: get this ghame, worth every centGRAPHICS DONT MATTER GAMEPLAY DOES!!!!!!!!

												One of the first Tom Clancy titles that took FPS gameplay to the next level. I recommend this to everyone who seeks a challenging and strategic type of shooter. However it is recommended that beginners play the training mission first.In Ghost Recon you have to be careful before you take each step. It's like being a soldier in real life, where if you run out in the open you'll get spotted and shot within seconds. Enemies are often equipped with camo suits so they can hide themselves between trees, bushes and dirt. The same realism applies to the damage dealt by weapons, most of the time kills are achieved with 1 shot (except if you hit arms or legs).Although the game is based on levels, the map design makes it feel almost like a sandbox game. There are always many ways to complete the objectives. Not to mention that the quality of the foliage and nature environment is phenomenal for the date the game came out. There are also different classes and weapon sets that you can choose, which means variety in your playing style. In most games where you choose a class, you can only do that in multiplayer. You can also boost the stats of your soldiers after every mission, which in my opinion makes it a little more balanced because of the AI being challenging.Definitely recommended.			"

												I actually became a gamer because of this game 12 years ago. Especially, I liked the multiplay mode playing in the large field. Compared to today's FPS, this game feels competely different in combat. Due to the characteristic field of view, you always feel like being a sniper even with an M4 assault rifle. Due to this, there were a lot of campers online in those days. Nevertheless, camping in this game makes sense because Ghost Recon is made for that. When I was playing online in those days, no one got mad for camping because everybody knew that it's the basic strategy of this game and if you keep running around in the field you simply get shot. Probably, you would have to spend being prone all the time and move like Big Boss in MGSV to get closer to enemies. It sounds boring for some of you but if you like the movie ""Sniper"" (1993), you would love this game even today. It would be difficult to play the multiplay mode today, but the singleplay mode is still enjoyable since the enemy AI are extream sharp shooters wtih AK-47. Don't play this game like Call of Duty. Just take time as much as you like to complete the missions. That's how you truly enjoy this game.			"

Immersion is also crawling on your belly in a guillie suit, for 20 minutes, all the way across an entire map because one shot=one kill and it goes both ways in this game.I've probably played almost every military shooter out there, across all console and PC titles, all the way up to the most recent Tom Clancy's Wildlands. But this game....Look, just buy it and both its expansions for dirt cheap, search out the Heroes Unleashed mod on ModDB. which is the 15 year long masterwork of one man, and then find the first and third person view mod on the ghostrecon.net forums which brings the game up to modern FPS speed.Then enjoy the feeling of tension, the feeling of actually being scared to get shot, or scared that one of your teammates will get gunned down, but also the feeling of victory when your tactical plan comes through and you eliminate all tangos.You will literally never need another shooter.

It's not like shoot them up, you have to think of your own startegy to pass the Mission-This game is one of the more realistic games, when they shoot you 1 time, you'll probably die-In this game it is required to commander 1 or 2 teams(depends on how many teams you will take), and you can send your troops across the map with your orders because they will not move if you don't tell them to move-Max number of teams is 3(including your own team), so the game is not that hard to play-No bugs or crashes during the game-The game is forgotten but it doesn't need any updates or patches-You can make a perfect teams of Ghosts waiting for your command-The game is 15 Missions long. Not too long, not too short if you ask me-Community isn't dead but there aren't many players that patrol through the Community Hub-Models for the game are okCONS-Multiplayer is dead, ubi.com isn't working for the game. Only GameRanger supports Multiplayer now, and there is only 1 server online-You can't jump in the gameI recommend it. 8/10 Would be a Ghost again!			"

												** [[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon]] **""Tactical"" is a word many game publishers love to abuse for lacking first person shooters; Ghost Recon is not one of those games. Expect stellar gameplay with a variety of missions ranging from the jungle to the desert, weapons and customization. The campaign(s) are straight forward with a realistic approach focusing on establishing a democracy in a war-stricken land. The gameplay if a first-person shooter with a few HUD items along with a tactical map on which the player can direct his/her troops. Don't expect to get attached to the characters unless the player renames them after close companions in real life. There is a small skill tree on which the player can update units' skills including ""Leadership"", ""Marksmanship"", and more. Once the player's soldier dies in that campaign, they lose him and his skillset forever. There are a few classes to choose from with specialized weaponry corresponding to each class which makes each class valuable in its own respects. The multiplayer is dead, unless the player play it with a friend; unfortunantly, this is where the game shines. Strategizing on the map allows for dynamic gameplay; putting the player and their friends' minds together really makes the player feel as if the player is operating in a real spec ops mission. One of the downfalls to the gameplay has to be the difficulty, I recommend saving often with the ""quick-save"" and ""quick-load"" features; one wrong move can put a world of hurt on the player's team. Expect to run this game at a solid-locked 60FPS with ultra-high graphics. There is still a pretty decent modding community providing the player with extra campaign missions including a WWII campaign! Even though this game was made way back in 2000, it is still the most tactical game on my list. PROS:+ Solid Gameplay+ 60 FPS+ Variety of Mods+ Easy Integration of Mods+ Great Multiplayer With Friends+ Endless Hours of GameplayCons:- Brutal Difficulty- Dead Online Multiplayer			"

												I remember playing the old CD version of Ghost Recon back in the day. I could remember the old Windows 2000 computer powering up, and the big screen box with the visible pixelated graphics. Playing Ghost Recon on that computer was the best childhood i had... Because there was nothing like it either before or after. (Besides the release of Rainbow Six up until Lockdown came which, in my opinion, was a total piece of ♥♥♥♥ for the PC.) The wide open spaces created fear to both me and my friends of getting shot from God knows where. The slow pace of it all forced you to tread carefully, instead of taking a run-and-gun approach. The multiplayer was fantastic. I remember playing with a couple of my friends (as well as fiends, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and pure disgusting enemies just to prove it could beat them at something,) over LAN and Internet once I got this game, and it was great. We usually play coop, since that was the main point of the game, but we also game a try of the converseriel gamemodes (excuse my spelling) and found a whole 'nother world behind it. It was great....And then this came along.... The original game.... The original thing. At first i hesitated to buy it. I knew that all the multiplayer servers were down since the death of gamespy, but that didn't stop me from getting the game and it's expansion roots...And it was just like my childhood. There wer tons and tons of community servers to play on. The gaming was high definiton, rather than the good ol' 2000. Succesful mods gave the game a big bang, not to mention the community servers for those mods. It... was... EPIC!!!So i urge you, both Ghost Recon fans and not, to buy this game. It is worth your money and your while.Oh, and a word of advice...Stay the ♥♥♥♥ away from Ghost Recon Wildlands.Thank you			"

												How does it hold up in 2017? Quite honestly.. just finished the main campaign and it took me 7 hours. I did it however with the help of quicksaving. It used to be one of my all time favourite games, and oddly enough playing it again after so many years took nothing away from the fun. It´s challenging, enjoyable and a rewarding game that worked without any issues. I am going to tackle the expansion packs next, these are new to me and i have never played them before. Some thoughts.-This game does not hold you hand, only way to advance is to learn and be better Extremely rewarding and fun.-Not having visible weapon model and iron sights actually adds to the immersion, i wish modern games would do it too.-Shooting in this game still feels very satisfying. Guns are very powerfull and you need to take your time aiming.-Your squad mates are surprisingly good. Competent in firefight, seek cover etc. If you give orders sensibly they rock.-Campaign is very well paced. After a tough one theres 1-2 chill ones to just have fun with.-Game runs at 1920x1080 without any issues. Take note that menus are still 800x600.-If you worried that playing it again makes it lose the magic, certainly didn´t for me.			"

												This game has everything. It is very hard, takes a ton of skill and you will want to cry when your soldiers that have been on your first mission finally dies. This is what all FPS should be based aeound these days and not crap like COD where it is way too easy. 16 hours and I still havn't finished the campain and there are 2DLC with tons more missions as well! So worth every penny 10/10. Best thing Ubisoft every made.			"

												An amazing tactical FPS when Tom Clancy's was still a solid and honest franchise, not like today with the empty games affected by the uplay spyware to make you buy the dlc's and online requierements trying to rob your money only.This is a  "" 1 shot 1 kill "" type of game like old school shooters, you better know how to take cover.The campaigns are  Awesome !  Very hard, but you can still use as many quick saves as you want.The skirmish modes can be played like FOR EVER !The LAN MODE is the best I have seen in a game EVER : You have to manage 9 soldiers like your opponents and you can manage them from tactical screen asking them to overwatch you or to go for point, or you can pick at any time any of them to get where the action is straight away. 9 soldiers to choose on the field, at any moment, is better than any respawning system.Easy to manage, it is very quick to launch any type of game, you don't have to wait 5 minutes between each maps like insurgency.This game is from  2001  and the graphics are still more precise and shiny than todays games and sometimes I get killed because i am amazed by the moving landscapes...It still works fine on windows 7/64 or windows 10  no problemo.An amazing game that makes all the ""call of money / battlefields dlc industy / Medal of Honor My ♥♥♥ ""  look like big turds.

												Ghost Recon is fun. let me say that right up front. It's entertaining, the missions and terrain are varied, but there are some problems. The  enemy AI isn't so smart, they display some tactical sense and react to your moves, but they still manage to stand there while you kill them off. Your own team ain't much smarter. Apparently, selection for the ""Ghosts"" is long on weapons handling and PT but short on survival sense. You must rely on a command map to move your teams around. It's very clumsy to constantly switch back and forth to this map - downright fatal in the middle of a fight. I was very impressed with the sound, the noise of automatic gunfire is just dead on target, to the point that I can actually tell whether a shot was fired by a team member or a soviet soldier by sound of the weapon.

												Ghost Recon remains as one my favorite Tactical Shooters ever. I've been playing it for years and I still think its outstanding in realsim even today.Although it doesn't simulate bullet ballistics, and you cant repeal out of helos like arma, its simplicity,  with ambient sounds like wind, crickets, water and absence of music make the game feel tense and realistic.  it all creates an environment which allow the player to make tactical decisions concerning military operations in an open world, and combine simplicity and smoothness of controls, as well as immersive sounds, and engaging AI for an immersive almost  military simulation.We can only hope Ground Branch takes its place as a new true Ghost recon game.

												War is hell, but if you're gonna do it, you gotta do it right. This game is as relevant and riveting today as it was when it first came out. It makes no bones about what it is: A pure tactical simulator, geared toward getting your team out alive and completing objectives from rescuing hostages to full-scale assault on armored patrols. My only gripe with this game is that, while it has good singleplayer, the AI of your team cannot often be trusted. Sending the computers into combat situations often results in friendly casualties, meaning it is best to take control of the squad you're sending into battle at one time. This is just my experience of course, but it does hamper you in that you cannot have two teams conquering two objectives at the same time.  However, they can act as sentries if placed right, and will defend points and shoot enemy soldiers with great accuracy, just not while they are on the move. Really though, this isn't a big issue, all it means is that the missions take a little longer, and even so, time flies when you are having fun! The AI of the enemies is very good, and they'll give you a bit of a bite even on recruit. This is not an arcade shooter, its a milsim on a tactical level. And I guarantee, if you take it as that, you're gonna have a helluva time.			"

												This game is for people who won't judge it by its graphics but on how the gameplay is and how it works. I played this when I was younger and I can honestly say that this is a lot better than the newer ones, not saying the newer ones aren't good I just prefer this one. First off if you go in thinking that this is going to be like Call of Duty you can't be any more wrong. Essentially this is based on how you build your 6-man army, you will die in a max of 3-4 hits if you're lucky usually you'll die in one hit along with your enemies. If even one of your character dies you can call it game over because you might need that extra sniper of demolitions, and make every shot count because you can miss pretty easily though. "

												Ghost Recon, THE tactical shooter, what a modern military shooter should really be. What is Ghost Recon? Now it is a series displayed by the corporate greed of Ubisoft and has become a CoD esque action shooter. But, when the first game was released, it was a tactical shooter; you know? The kind where taking 1-3 shots will kill you, where movement is limited and where running in the open was a death wish.I am getting off topic. Why do I recommend this game? It's simply the best Ghost Recon, in my own opinion, feel free to disagree with me. But I believe Ghost Recon 1 is the best. The reason for this is its amazing sound design in 2001; real recorded weapons, amazing soundtrack, etcetera. Its heart-poundingly delicious gameplay where if you mess up, a single bullet can end you. So the game has the Dark Souls esque, trial and error system; before Demon Souls was released, might I add. Last but not least, the game still has a tiny bit of multiplayer life left on GameRanger.Now for the flaws: The AI can either be stupid, or insanely smart, it fluxuates. The Multiplayer has BARELY any life left, but if you are lucky, you can play an MP game. The graphics are also abysmal; even in 2001 when this game was released, the game had decent graphics, but it wasn't the same as some games at the time; even some on consoles!All in all, this is a MUST PLAY! The game is simply too fun to ignore! I even had a friend who played the demo and became addicted, so much so that I am gifting him his GR soon! See you in the Republic of Georgia!			"

												Just like I remember it on the PS2, the campaign is unforgiving, and the enemies are worth fearing. That feeling of completing a mission (like stopping an invading army with a squad of 4, or saving UN peacekeepers from an armored assault) is very satisfying. The graphics are obviously dated, and the controls can be a bit wonky, but you probably aren't playing a game from 2001 anyway if graphics are your main concern.

												I played Ghost recon when it first came and was instantly hooked. Since then the development of military FPS have rocketed away from what was – back in 2001 – quite an advanced game. Both the original game and its expansion packs (Desert Siege and Island Thunder) was built around huge maps, the management of a small team of six soldiers and sharp punishment for not thinking tactically and proceeding with some caution. The enemy had a deadly aim, even if their AI wasn’t always on top.Then came various games like Call of Duty, Battlefield, Ghost recon Future Soldier and Sniper Ghost Warrior, and more work and less time to play made me give away my Ghost Recon Gold collections box to a friend. It was just by pure chance that I earlier this year suddenly discovered that Steam sold the original Ghost Recon with its official expansion packs for “pennies” and I could not resist buying it. It can be a risky business to return to old pleasures; like a movie or a book, you remember from the past, but I found myself enjoying the gameplay as much as I did back in 2001. In addition, with the mods like frostbite and CENTCOM you may have hours of fun. Just forget about the old graphics and focus on the thrill of the mission.My advice: Play it on elite difficulty for maximum challenge and fun. "

												An old classic, but a lot of fun once you get used to it.Ghost Recon is what I would call a streamlined simulator. It doesn't have nearly the amount of details found in ARMA, but it has everything you need to have for tense and realistic engagements. Because it's streamlined, you can quickly get on it, play it for a little bit, then go about your day if your time is limited.The game is a little bit clunky, but it's something you get used to. Since Ghost Recon is about tactical movement and picking your targets wisely, it's not major. Your brain will be vital to keeping you and your soldiers alive.""Sweat saves blood, blood saves lives, but brains saves both.""

												I remember playing this when I was a kid and coming back to it now, its even more addictive than before. I highly support this game as a classic. Each mission has its own unique style to it and poses its own set of obstacles to the mission. Really the only downside is the first person can take some getting used to, but it makes the game amazing. In the entire set of Ghost Recon games, this has to be the best. Seriously, play it. It is worth it! you can have endless fun with it.			"

												Ghost Recon is a realistic tactical shooter with squad control, similar to Rainbow Six Rogue Spear, but different in that it is more ""play as you go"" and depicts U.S. Army Special Forces fighting out in the open instead of the more methodical preplanned close quarters counter terrorist manuevers. I'll compare this to its rivals; ""Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis"" / ""Arma: Cold war Assault"" and ""Delta Force: Land Warrior"".This game costs around $10 without the two expansions, $20 with, and isn't on sale frequently. DF:LW has the same price, but includes more missions and a greater number of larger and more diverse maps. OFP/Arma ranges from $6 to free, goes on sale frequently, and has much larger maps that are fewer in number (though commmunity maps for ARMA outnumber GR's).GR controls are simpler, but more limiting than OFP/Arma and DF.GR total squad and fire team sizes are limited to six and three, respectively, while the OFP/Arma limit is twelve for each category and even has a high command module allowing for control of more. Squad control is less developed than OFP/Arma, but moreso than DF.GR's smaller numbers of vehicles and craft can't be entered or operated as in OFP/Arma, but they play more of a role than in DF.The GR tactical map is less informative, and there is no compass, watch, gps, or radio as there are in OFP/Arma.GR view and engagement distances are shorter, usually being within 130m (though fogless mod can extend that out to 500m). GR lacks the external ballistics effects of DF and OFP/Arma.Movement is more restricted in general, though GR allows one to lean whereas the others don't (without mods). Weaponry and munitions can't be picked up, and total selection is smaller.GR has wind effects, but no day/night or weather cycle like OFP/Arma.GR's AI can navigate tight spaces better than the others.Overall, Ghost Recon costs more and offers less, but looks slightly better and has a built in recorder and more detailed after action review.Additional content can be found on these sites : http://www.ghostrecon.net/ (get Enhanced Realism mod) http://www.moddb.com/games/tom-clancys-ghost-recon/downloads http://www.fileplanet.com/35386/0/section/Ghost-Reconhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/realistictacticalgaming "

												A game that was set in the future with guns that were obsolete when the game was made. A game where being able to see further than your foreskin was not important despite being gibbed by AI snipers and machinegunners on the other side of the map. A game where being able to tell if a person is an enemy or on your team was nigh-impossible because by the time he came out of the fog of war, you were already dead if he was an enemy, or dead anyway because he didnt know if you were an enemy or not either. Also if the fog density wasn't bad enough, theyre was foggy levels dedicated to you being completely blind for an hour.The best ♥♥♥♥ing shooter of all time. The best ♥♥♥♥ing multiplayer of all time.

												Solid real tactical shooter held back sometimes by well... early 2000's AI pathing issues. Plays slowly enough to reward actual tacitcal decisions, and flows well enough into more difficult missions without overstaying its welcome. A solid 30 to 40 hour experience depending on how much of a completetionist you are and well worth the money even today. Ran fine for me on Windows 7/8/ and 10 with no need for mods.			"

												This is one of my favorite tactical shooters. Sure, the graphics are pretty dated, but the gameplay is truly excellent. It's realistic and challenging, so don't expect to just run and gun your way through every situation. Squad control is easy, and most of the time, it works very well. There are a ton of mods for this game that add so much new content, too, so replay value is pretty much endless. If you like tactical shooters, you will want this game.			"

												One of my favourie games of all time. Spent hundreds of hours playing single player and multi (when was available). Even today playable and can provide lots of fun everyday. Graphics a bit out of date but gameplay it's just amazing and unbeatable. Difficult and unforgiving every time when you make mistake. You're going to use F6 and F7 buttons very often - as it should be. CoD? Battlefield? You should learn guys.Highly recomended especially for the price. Set of DLCs for few quid.

												13 years later, still the best tactical shooter out there. The speed at which a combat situation can swing, coupled with the limitless ways the player can respond to that change, really make this title stand out. Just spend ten bucks and have the most fun you've had playing single player since you first played Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon back in 2001.			"

Strangely fun in its own masochistic way. Just make sure to watch your fire and where your enemies are, control your AI teammates (instead of just ordering them to move), and take your time, and the game will... still be hard as hell, but managable at least.

I recomend this game to anyone and everyone who loves realistic, tactical shooters. In my opinion this game laid the foundation for the many shooter games that came after it.

												Before Scorestreaks (or Killstreaks), before Perks, and the run-and-gun nature of modern day first person shooters--Ghost Recon was the ideal Thinking Man's Shooter. The original Ghost Recon was my first foray into competitive gaming and PC gaming in general. The maps are a work of art, the gameplay centers on skill rather than gimmicks (no AI-controlled helicopters to rack up kills for you). Ghost Recon was one of the last, and if not the best of a dying breed... the tactical first person shooter.			"

So you must think about your plan to succeed on your mission.- Amazing gameplay and missionsCones: - Graphics arnt great.

												Still one of the most hardcore and tactical shooters. Runs with no issues on Windows 10.The graphics and sound still hold up well. The game is showing its age in areas from a gameplay perspective, but never in a way that greatly detracts from the experience provided you can adapt to some of the issues. For example, squad commands are limited and given from an overlay and you can't direct your squad to a position from the first-person view, which is a little clunky. In addition, your squad generally feels like a backup selection of playable characters that tag along with you as opposed to a group of AI you'll feel you can often use tactically and trust to perform without getting themselves killed.Other issues I had included the way the game occasionally cheap-shots you by spawning a tank or truck full of enemies out of nowhere, which rolls up to your position in complete silence; and whilst the large, open maps still feel unique and fun to play on, you can't climb or step down many hills or cliffs, which tends to limit your tactical ability.Still, as I said, none of this greatly detracts from the experience as it really never feels hugely misaligned with the gameplay--they're more just indications of the game's age. The atmosphere and intensity remains intact. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend a playthrough if you're into tactical shooters.			"

												Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon®-------------------------------ONE of the best FPS/Tactical shooting i have ever played in my entire life... This one is diffrent then the other FPS games THIS is was Tactical FPS should be like Battefield? Call of Duty? PFFFT! those are kinds game against this game You are put up into 3 teams (which can be customised to around 50/90%) AlphaBravoCharlieThere is 3 diffeculties Normal Veteran Elite Sinse i have finished the game on ELITE with out loosing a single member in my squad i can say that this game... is freaking hard even on normal You have 1 life you cannot generate HP OR! revive your teammates so if you plan your move wrong... then you are dead. trust me you will plan your moves wrong so many times SO!! many timesunless you cheat... This game takes tactics to a compleat new level you can go guns blazing thinking you will hit everyone no the enemy AI haves a fast reaction to like a real life trained military man Nope you will die from that! Tips is to go sneaky sinse you can uppgrade your soliders and stuff so they can be better at stuff.I highly suggest getting both of the DLC's when you get the game to get more missions and maps  "

												I always loved the Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon games. In this game you might not feel as if your with a team, but it kinda gives you the sense of how it would feel if you went into combat for your first time. You get shot like two times your dead type of feeling. Thats not the only thing that makes the game so extraordinary. You can send any of your squads into a area to finish off any hostiles, but be warned if you do this, you have a chance of losing a squad or squad members. Every member you pick will get certain stat points so you can build up there weapon handling, stealth, endurance and etc. There are five types of classes you can pick from, Sniper, support, rifleman, demo, and specialists. You can make up to three squads Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie, but heres the cache, you can only have two members if you pick to have three squads. If you pick two squads you can have three members in it. I love that you can pick what type of members you can assign into your squad. The only thing that sucks is that if you get one of your guys wounded they stay wounded when you progress in the game, so they are pretty much dead if they get shot one more time.			"

												You can use Hamachi to play online with friends just copy the person your joining ipv4 and use that as a server ip. Enjoy!The game is old and I know that because I was playing this as a kid a very very long time ago, I loved it back then and now I still love it as an Adult. Just remember everyone go's home or we restart the mission. If you have problems with the game flickering you need to go and find the options file and change the full screen from TRUE to FALSE this will fix that issue if you run into it. Good luck and I hope you will have a ton of fun reliving the good old days of Ghost Recon before the pile of ♥♥♥♥ they threw at us.If your someone who is all about the graphics this game isn't for you, If you want to play a now old school game then this is a must. If you do buy it and want to team up for a game go ahead and add me.			"

												I got to a certain point in the game and it kept freezing up during the same mission repeatedly. I have played Tom Clancy games before and games of greater graphic requirements before. I am not sure what the issue is but I will uninstall and reload. However, I am not sure I want to go through this game again because it is so archaic. I normally like to play from the first game through the most recent to see the progress made in each subsequent game. However, I am not sure I want to go through this again.			"

												A test of patience. That's how I would sum up this game. Everything looks like everything else; the enemies blend into the backgrounds, as do your own forces. You will spend entire hours manually shifting and manuvering your forces around the maps just for the oppertunity to pull off a dozen killshots or less, most of which your squads may grab before you. Each of your units is equivilant to one life; loose them all, and you lose the scenerio. You also lose some combat effectiveness, but it's so tedious manuvering your squads that sometimes its easier to send one squad scouting around the map until it's slaughtered. Not enough reward for time invested.			"

												This game, despite being very old to date, is actually quite the gem when it comes to gameplay. If you like a strategy FPS set up, well this will be your kind of game. You are given the option to create 3 squads for each mission, which can be given orders specific to that squad. The system used to further instruct the squads is based on ""suppression"", ""assault"", ""reconnasiance"", ""advance at all costs"", ""advance"", and ""hold"". This is very simple so that the player can easily control the AI's reaction to detecting enemies in the particular squad, but overall can make for an extremely dynamic scenario. in addition to squad orders, you can change between each individual in the squad or play multiplayer with friends to achieve the same goal.Every mission has a different goal and a different map, though i have found many of the goals to be the same type on consecutive missions, which made it feel grinding until you see the action of the game. Unfortunately the game also has a sort of ""level"" system for individual soldiers, which increases the feeling of grinding despite the fact that it's advantagous. Even with the previously stated feelings on the game, i found that overall Ghost Recon® was very fun especially to people who would love to see scenarios play out rather than directly get involved in them and vice versa for people who want to be in the scenario. In fact, the nature of this game's mechanics make it possible to both see how a scenario will play out and also have you be a major part in the scenario as well.Side Notes: missions typically take up to about 15-30 minutes, so if you're a casual player you'll be making alot of quick saves on the longer term missions (sometimes a whole hour)			"

												The bottom line is that the original Ghost Recon remains as the best release in the entire series.The game shines in the non-linear, non-restrictive gameplay that has plagued many linear corridor shooters (to include Ghost Recon Future Soldier). Players have a map, and a team of men, and must apply critical thinking through mission analysis in order to be successful. The game also has an outstanding damage model that still outshines most shooters; A single 5.56mm round will kill, and players can sustain arm and leg wounds that affect their ability to shoot and move. Third person animations also reflect player damage in the form of limping and visible blood stains and gunshot wounds.There is also an RPG-like system that allows players to develop their Ghosts and apply personal attributes that will improve their performance. My only big gripe is the use of a reticule system instead of a first person weapon. Unlike Ravenshield, there is no on-screen, first person weapon. There are only a series of recitules that can be zoomed in to simulate weapon sights.			"

												GOODThe original and by far the best of the series. Dont go diving in expecting some running and gunning action, go in expecting a slow pace, methodical, fairly realistic tactical shooter.For those talented and stubborn enough to get past the first level the single player experience is quite good. It is basicly a sandbox environment with a mixture of fixed enemies and a few that spawn, unlike the sequal which is just a mad spawn frenzy.I couldnt begin to imagine what i could of accomplished with my life if i haddent pumped most of my hours into this game over the years. Its best enjoyed with friends online or LAN and is incredibly addictive and also surprisingly smart and punishing. Play only for single player for a tour'de force of when GR was good.BADBest enjoyed on XBOX 1. Unfortuantely hardly any multiplayer support anymore. Terrorist hunt is not as good as console version. View distance that affects you doesnt affect your enemies.Back in the day score 9.1Modern 6			"

												Ghost Recon is one of the all time classics of the tactical FPS genre. I have played this game many times over since the early 2000s, and it still plays great. Even if the graphics are slightly dated, the game play more than makes up for it. You have to be smart and tactical in your approach to combat and as such this game is a rarity nowadays. If you don’t plan the approach, more often than not, you will be spotted and taken out. This is also an open map style game so you can achieve your objectives from many angles, only helping its tactical appeal. Another interesting aspect is the ‘command map’ in which you can control other squads and have them move as a separate entity. Each squad has maximum of three members and you can have 3 squads but a max of 6 total characters. Each of these characters is playable through selecting him or her in the command interface. This game truly is the pinnacle of the genre so if you’re not hung up on graphics but are interested in realistic combat, then this is definitely the game for you.			"

												This game is pretty cool and challanging . I like the texture and being in control of your platoon and the verity of weapons you have . The only problem is the camera , are you suppost to be in first person or are you a ghost literally . They could have had the opnion to switch the camera view to firstperson or thirdperson but if they just had firstperson atleast make it look like it by seeing your hands and feet .			"

												This game, despite being very old to date, is actually quite the gem when it comes to gameplay. If you like a strategy FPS set up, well this will be your kind of game. You are given the option to create 3 squads for each mission, which can be given orders specific to that squad. The system used to further instruct the squads is based on ""suppression"", ""assault"", ""reconnasiance"", ""advance at all costs"", ""advance"", and ""hold"". This is very simple so that the player can easily control the AI's reaction to detecting enemies in the particular squad, but overall can make for an extremely dynamic scenario. in addition to squad orders, you can change between each individual in the squad or play multiplayer with friends to achieve the same goal.Every mission has a different goal and a different map, though i have found many of the goals to be the same type on consecutive missions, which made it feel grinding until you see the action of the game. Unfortunately the game also has a sort of ""level"" system for individual soldiers, which increases the feeling of grinding despite the fact that it's advantagous. Even with the previously stated feelings on the game, i found that overall Ghost Recon® was very fun especially to people who would love to see scenarios play out rather than directly get involved in them and vice versa for people who want to be in the scenario. In fact, the nature of this game's mechanics make it possible to both see how a scenario will play out and also have you be a major part in the scenario as well.Side Notes: missions typically take up to about 15-30 minutes, so if you're a casual player you'll be making alot of quick saves on the longer term missions (sometimes a whole hour)			"

MP is classic. and for 2001 its pretty good. except the rugged geometry, the sprite explosions. the rough models. and the lens flare sun. OK so this isnt BF3. but BF3 aint no GR.

												The bottom line is that the original Ghost Recon remains as the best release in the entire series.The game shines in the non-linear, non-restrictive gameplay that has plagued many linear corridor shooters (to include Ghost Recon Future Soldier). Players have a map, and a team of men, and must apply critical thinking through mission analysis in order to be successful. The game also has an outstanding damage model that still outshines most shooters; A single 5.56mm round will kill, and players can sustain arm and leg wounds that affect their ability to shoot and move. Third person animations also reflect player damage in the form of limping and visible blood stains and gunshot wounds.There is also an RPG-like system that allows players to develop their Ghosts and apply personal attributes that will improve their performance. My only big gripe is the use of a reticule system instead of a first person weapon. Unlike Ravenshield, there is no on-screen, first person weapon. There are only a series of recitules that can be zoomed in to simulate weapon sights.			"

												I really recommend this game!Though it's one of the ""Golden Oldies,"" this game provides the action and challenge of the modern day soldier. The enemy is as clever as though it's a real person playing against you! Also, your teammates can think for themselves whether or not to shoot, and when to stay in recon mode. The teamates have excellent leadership skills, too!As for Multiplayer, servers don't exist anymore. However, if you have a friend who also plays Ghost Recon, it is fun to host a server and play with them!Though an individual ordering system isn't available, group-ordering has never been easier! Teammates choose the shortest road when given orders to assault or suppress, and choose the safest road when given orders to go 'Recon.' A cool part is that the team-leaders show signs with their arms and hands when giving orders, instead of talking!This may be the first Ghost Recon, it may not be as advanced as 'Future Warfighter,' and it may not show a gun on 'First-Person View,' but it's still an investment that is not bad to make!My opinion: Buy the game!""Long Live Tom Clancy!""

The game is easy to learn, however it's difficult to master, which makes me still come back to it, 13 years later after it first came out.

												I played through Ghost Recon in the '90s and played through it again in the '10s. This game holds up very well. You go through the game picking out enemies without been seen and not going through as Rambo. Many missions have you choosing optimal angles of attack on targets because in 2-3 hits you're down, so you can't just walk straight at enemy strongholds.

												My thoughts on this great, old school and respectively 'simply' old tactical FPS-game. Unique in its scale, immersive and atmospheric, characterized by a realistic; 'one bullet/one kill' or, -depending on the perspective: 'one bullet/one death'-dynamic with an open-world approach to its first-person combat system what, I would say because of the nature of this game but a few games managed to portray it like this, in its ""vanilla''; almost bare-bones: ''simple''-like form of approach.It's a game all right. Doesn't feel so much when you play it, which is sort of 'counter-intuitive' for a (casual) gamer, speaking as one. This game doesn't just resemble 'any' old-school shooter though for the experience is highly tactical, systematic, rooted in realistic aesthetics therefore perceived to be as such because there is just pure action here. It's like what I would imagine to be; stepping ''into'' VR for the first time. Captivation, immersion; beyond that to me subjectively this game (also) tells an engaging story.One could label the experience as ''adrenaline-filled'' military 'arcade-sim' on a simulated wide or large ''playing''-field or 'sandbox' - filled with set objectives and goals one has to accomplish and can so go about things in an 'asymmetrical' manner in which one does not stand alone. I think this game is well worked out to focus on that what is important and to incorporate in its execution ''only'' that which truly matters; very well. The game is all about the immersive action one takes part in.A Player is a part of - and is able to control - 3 squads within the play-field, with in-game real-time planning and execution phase where you as player can give (real-time) orders to your AI-controlled squad-mates through the means of a (GPS) map. Available orders comprise of a set of basic instructions that encompass all aspects that one would need in the field in order to command your squads to victory with only thing between you and the objectives: the enemy AI, which is feisty.This focus on where the priorities of the experience lie make the game excel in its simplicity. This simplicity doesn't make the game less challenging and is something that might not cater to casual FPS-players in the sense that the game takes the player by ''surprise'' presenting certain scale and depth to this simulated, virtual open-world combat that feels very grim, realistic; calculated & precise. It puts the player under pressure. Game is difficult in a sense, because it's relatively easy to take part in but hard to control as it is ultimately hard to master. In this sense I can say that, from experience; trial and error: 'savescumming' and 'restarting' often come to mind so there is a certain learning curve involved.Non the less this is a basic and somewhat simplistic (''minimalist'') shooter that has no gun model which was considered 'unusual' at the time of release (a perception I reckon hasn't changed much in the ''meanwhile'') but at heart is a well executed action-game with a certain amount of 90's charm infused within its essence. Game bares a Tom Clancy-title or name, after all; meaning: it has got a certain techno-thriller feel to it, which I like. (nostalgia)There is something about the game that gives quite a depth to the overall experience besides the nature of the game itself, which in its essence is pretty straightforward. I think that this is mostly contributed due to the storytelling (this aspect was more evident and prevelant, I think in previous iterations of the Rainbow Six series) but equal in part to the execution of the action phase which is very smooth.'Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon' is sort of a game that stands out as almost one of a kind shooter that excels in the sense of achievement, by being an 'open world' action-'sim' and having a realistic standard similar to what 'Rogue Spear' (and original Rainbow Six) achieved before it. There where the focus solely lied on the CQB-combat in Rainbow Six, this game takes that unforgiving style of gameplay to a 'wider-scale' of game-play.			"

Weapons are incredibly innacurate, and I have very little idea how to command my troops. Despite this, the game is still good. It's kind of like ArmA, if you really appreciate tactical shooters, you can look past a lot of these things. Just don't expect much polish in this title. Bonus points for being set in 2008 and everyone is outfitted like its 1990.			"
