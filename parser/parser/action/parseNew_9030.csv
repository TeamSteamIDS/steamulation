												Second and in my opinion better expansion of Quake. You have few weapon alterations, different from first expansion, which are even more deadly.(I am big fan of multiple rockets and cluster grenades.) The game brings more items and enemies as well. You fight more fantasy foes than before, like altered knights and death knights which were turned into statues of greek warriors and minotaurs, floating swords or dark wizards who reminds me of Mental from Serious Sam. New items are Anti-Grav Belt and Power Shield. First one will make you jump higher into longer distances and second will reduce taken damage. Two new episodes contains fantasy and ancient history based levels with unique bosses like Guardians, Hephaestus or Overlord. Individual levels are pretty hard to play. Not because of lots of enemies, but because of shaking grounds, slippery surfaces (which leads to lava or void or another kind of death) and mazy levels.(Curse of Osiris!) But its really worth it. And after all these hellish fighting you spawn into final cave to face the Dragon. I recommend it highly for all FPS fans.			"

												Dissolution of Eternity is the second and final Quake 1 mission pack. It's a very fitting end to the game's official content and dovetails nicely with the previous expansion pack, Scourge of Armagon. It was developed by Rogue entertainment who also developed Strife and American McGee's Alice.Dissolution is much more fantasy based than Armagon. There's a distinctly mythological slant to the whole thing. You fight fantasy enemies like statues that come alive, these wraith like grim reaper creatures, magical swords that float and attack you, and the final boss is even a Dragon. It reminds me a lot of the original Quake's roots as a medieval fantasy game before the developers redesigned it as a first person shooter.Indeed looking at Dissolution like that it really does make the game feel like it comes full circle with the original Quake. It has a few really good boss encounters that fill in the gaps of quality that were unfortunately lacking in the original. It is also legitimately challenging and several of the levels are very long and feel almost epic length.The main negatives I would say about Dissolution of Eternity are the additional weapons they added weren't as impressive as Scourge of Armagon. You have things like a nailgun that shoots slightly more powerful nails, a rocket launcher that shoots three rockets at once, a lightning gun that just shoots a single projectile. If you play it back to back with Scourge you'll start to miss MJOLNIR.But besides that. The levels are all good, the action is still fresh, and it has a final boss encounter that more than makes up for how easy Armagon was. It makes for a fitting end to the original Quake, and it only makes you want to play through the entire saga again to experience it a second time.			"

												I love the mission pack. Quake is amazing, however, as many have already experienced, Mission Pack 2 is impossible to finish without cheating or using strange tricks. In Tomb of the Overlord, it is impossible to go up the elevator with the red arrow buttons. You can press them, but it doesn't move the elevator. You either have to rocket jump up or use the Fly cheat. I want to beat the normal way. Please fix.			"

Quake Mission Pack 2: Dissolution Of Eternity		* 8/10This second mission pack goes in an opposite direction compared to the first one.The game will be very tough as you will have to sweat longer to get new weapons, and the maps will be full of enemies, making this a real challenge.There are no new weapons but there are alternative ammos that give the player another fire option with different damage or effects, such as lava nails or multiple rockets.Level art now is more focused with meso-american, Egyptian or greek art styles prooviding more visual innovation, and according to that there will also be various minor bosses, such as guardians, or mummies.Considering the age of the game and the lack of 16:9 resolutions I would suggest to play it with any modern port available as it could provide some serious graphical update as well. I've played this with darkplaces and various texture packs.+++PROs+++ INNOVATION. This expansion provides a good product enriched with visual innovation and artistically inspired maps, not to mention the simplicity of the effective alternative ammos for the classic weapons. TOUGH. This expansion will really test you as you'll have to sweat a lot before you get something more powerful than your standard shotgun, you'll have to take down a lot of creatures with that first and going on with the game it'll be worse as there will be crowds of enemies, and you will have to wait for further weapons, making each level a tough challenge---CONs--- OLD ENGINE. The engine is quite old nowadays and lacks 16:9 resolutions. If you want higher resolutions you have to check also the DPI box in the Exe properties. Alternatively you can load the game using one of the many modern ports available around. I've used Darkplaces.I played this game on this machine:Laptop Lenovo Z50Intel Core i5-4210U8Gb RAM DDR3GeForce 840MIntel HD Graphics 4400Windows 10 Home x64 "

												This pack adds a lot more enemies and weapons, and the level design is pretty smart - the levels are much larger and average more than 100 enemies. The new weapons are very powerful - like the quad-rocket launcher - and seem a bit OP at times but it's still fun to use them on hordes of Quake's minions. The final level was pretty difficult for me, a Quake veteran. I recommend it!			"

												By far the inferior mission pack of the 2 here, the weapons are better but thats the only plus. Theres not very many levels, but the levels are absolutely HUGE. Theyre also poorly made with narrow hallways, confusing & bland areas make it easy to get lost, and in the earthquake levels and mazes (yes, mazes) make it bad. Only play if you're truly bored.  The final boss is much harder than the one in mission pack 1, thats about it.			"

												!!Important note!! You might have to use cheats to finish off the fifth level on the first chapter because the last enemy on the fifth level won’t spawn and this prevents you from finishing the level. Also people have had trouble with the lift in the Tomb of the overlord mission.What I liked about the game •	More quake. The gameplay is still very addictive and enjoyable. •	Awesome new enemies. •	Mission pack 2 doesn’t have any new weapons, but you now have different ammo types like plasma and cluster grenades. •	Top-notch level design.•	Brilliant boss battle at the end. •	Plenty of secrets to be found. What I disliked or was disappointed with •	The game is buggy, like I said the last enemy in chapter 5 won’t spawn and people have complained about the lift not working in the level Tomb of the Overlord. •	No secret levels. •	You have to patch up the game to restore the music (link below). Conclusion Not as good as the first mission pack, but still very enjoyable and the gameplay is very addictive. If you liked the first mission pack, I highly recommend this. 75/100 Ultimate quake patch

												Quake Mission Pack 2: Dissolution of Eternity is the second expansion pack released for the first Quake. It was made by  	Rogue Entertainment this time around and was released in 1997. Once again, it mostly concentrateds single-player, giving us more levels and new elements. It did have some new things for multiplayer, but eh, I doubt that anybody uses those. Probably all the stuff was ripped out when it comes to multiplayer.So, as usual, music isn't part of Steam release. Somehow I am not surprised. You will have to find CD or ripped audio yourself. And then if you have WIndows Vista or up, you will have trouble making game loop track properly. Will have to use something like _inmm. Just check guides around.It gives you choice between running in software or OpenGL mode. Software is superior. Not as muddy and gives better feel to dark world of Quake. And OpenGL has some trouble with lighting, like there is no such thing as ""full-bright"" textures.Oh, and don't forget to write ""+mlook"" in console once you start playing. This will enable mouselook.The story continues where Mission Pack left. You find piece of ""Common Prayer"" book from dead body, which explains thing that Quake wants to use time in some way or another. Meaning that you have to go and destroy time machine.Errrr, kinda confusing manual story, it kinda means that Quake wasn't just codename that human gave for unknown enemy. It implies that Quake is somebody who you haven't met yet, not original's final boss. Or something. Confusing.So, once again Quake's original atmosphere was thrown away. They didn't bring level design as realistical as in the first mission pack though. But it doesn't feel as great as in original Quake either. It has around 15 levels in total, divided into two episodes.The first episode deals with generic medieval-like setting of original Quake. You know them. Brown stone. Brown bricks. Green grass in outdoor areas. It tries to combine abstract with more of boring-real-like, like fortresses. Well, hard to say, but while in theory layouts aren't just corridors, I have trouble rememebering anything from this part. It's just weak.Second episode is where Mission Pack shows it's worth. You are sent through time and will have to visit Greece, Egypt, Mayan, some proper mediavel and elemental caves. It's like Hexen 2 before it was released, which even deals with same time periods. It's more memoriable and more interesting than the first part for sure, even if they still look quite dull. I do love Aztec level with those saw traps though.And yes, it doesn't have atmosphere, doesn't have same darkness. Just you, monsters, action and rocking soundtrack. Which was written by same person and sounds like Mission Pack 1 music but weaker. So, it's kinda meh as well if you ask me.And yes, it introduces some gameplay addition. The biggest one comes from the developers thinking ""boy, I wish the most tough enemies would die in 5 seconds"". Well, not exactly, but you can now collect additiona, stronger variety of ammo. Lava nails are just stronger, making Super Nailgun godlike. Helps with fact that mission pack has tendency to sometimes put you into corriodor with tough enemy in close range. Than there are multi-rockets. Kinda hard to use with Grenade Launcher, but once again kill stuff with Rocket Launcher. And Plasma Balls, or something, behave like splash damage mode for Lighting Gun. Kinda like what you expect from BFG.So, while it's not bunch of gimmicky weapons like in Mission Pack 1, it's still not a good addition. Makes you too overpowered. Turns tough foes into crackers. It doesn't helps that in these level sets you are given much more ammo than needed, you can just circle between your strong weapons.It also bring a many more enemies into Quake. On paper. In reality, most of them are either reskins or variations. It's not terribly interesting and is not gameplay-changer either. I do like the use of themed enemies, like mummies for Egypt levels, who behave like zombies but with more HP. But then, it got new bosses and tougher foes that are unique, more or less. The most important one is probably flying Reaper/Death thing. It's like Vore. But flies, faster. Not as much HP. But it shoots same annoying impossible-to-avoid explosive homing ball. And it's faster too. Good thing it's weaker, otherwise it would be quite horrible!Bosses are pretty good this time around. It got boss for Episode 1, which is Reaper but tougher. Wait, that one sounds lame. But bosses of Episode 2 are nice. It got mini-boss Guardian, that you have to fight few times. And final boss is a huge flying dragon. They say that one was supposed to appear in the original Quake. This one is real tough. It's a proper fight that actually lasts more than a minute, even with expansion pack's new overpowered arsenal. I salute to developers for finally bringing good bosses into Quake.It also seems to have some additions for multiplayer, but you know how it works: everything good probably was already spread around as mods.So, Mission Pack 2 is something between Quake and Mission Pack 1, having neither strong points. It's quite a weak expansion, with some problems. And it starts to become interesting only in the second half. But eh, Quake lovers will still like it.			"

												If you enjoyed QUAKE then you will enjoy this Mission Pack! This for me is way better than the last Mission Pack, this one adds a new ammo type for almost every weapon in the game! Plus there are a ton of new enemies to fight! The final boss is also challenging and awesome! This is worth more than $5. I would definitely recommend this Mission Pack for QUAKE!9/10			"

												How's THAT for a metal title? The second expansion of the original Quake held nothing back in the naming, and similarly holds nothing back in the challenge. Whereas Scourge of Armagon felt at times like The Lost Levels to Quake's Super Mario Bros, Dissolution of Eternity sometimes seems like The Loster Levels. This isn't necessarily down to good design, either, so if you're here looking for more quality Quake, you might want to read on before pulling the trigger.Whereas Quake had four episodes to choose from and Armagon had one long campaign, Dissolution has two themed episodes to frag through. The first, Hell's Fortress, is a series of sprawling castles, caves, and catacombs. The second, Corridors of Time, is an assortment of historically-themed touching on Egyptian tombs, Mayan sacrifices, and, uh, wizard towers. You might note that none of these lineups contain anything techy or eldritch, and that's an important thing to keep in mind. Dissolution's 14 levels are all roughly castle or tomb themed, skipping two of the major Quake aesthetics and leaving most of the grunts behind.A strongly-themed pack isn't a bad thing as long as the levels are executed well, but for the most part I can't say they are. The first level of Hell's Fortress is a prime example of the pack's shortcomings. It's a castle you infiltrate through towers and tunnels, but all the architecture is flat, featureless, and relies too heavily on single textures. You're going to get very, very tired of olive brick and brown caves after just a few levels, owing in part to how much longer and larger they are than base Quake maps. The later parts of episode one and parts of episode two have more interesting designs but they feel like the exception, not the rule.The gripes don't end at the architecture, either. Encounters throughout Dissolution tend to happen in cramped spaces like narrow corridors, rather than the platforms and arenas you'd expect from the prior Quake maps. Part of this is obviously owing to the heavy reliance on knight enemies, but once ogres and fiends start getting mixed in you'll find fights ending very quickly, often not in your favor. The new enemies only exacerbate this, with most of them having wide attack patterns and several exploding on death. And if that wasn't enough, most levels rely heavily on traps like collapsing floors and swinging axes to up the ante, but instant death in a lava pit only leads to frustration given the length of the levels.At least the new weapons help blunt the painful combat. They're not really new weapons, but new ammo types for your existing weapons that generally do more damage. Nailguns get lava nails, launchers get cluster explosives, and the lightning gun can be switched to a BFG-style projectile. For some reason the ammo placement doesn't seem to take the new ammo types into account, so you'll be topped off on most ordnance even through pitched battles. There are some creative item additions like shields and gravity belts, but the levels are never really designed to take advantage of them, as if the item and level designers had no idea what the other was doing.Overall, Dissolution of Eternity plays like a more immediately lethal form of Quake without much else to add. The levels are longer but not as expertly crafted in look, feel, or mechanics. Between the cramped combat and obnoxious traps you're more likely to run into bouts of frustration, and the new enemies, ammo, and items don't make much difference in the face of that. It's more Quake and more Quake is good, but if you're still jonesing after the base game and Scourge of Armagon, you might be better served with community maps.			"

												2 new episodes, loads of new weapons and ammo types (plus all the weapons and powerups from the previous expansion), better & brighter map design, and loads more music with almost every level having it's own track. Armagon was excellent for all the new stuff it added and this one continues to build on it. If these two missions packs were released today they'd be $30 DLC (or a brand-new game considering how CoD is). Considering how bad the last episode of the original Quake was I'd consider either of these mission packs better than the original for their outstanding map design and gameplay improvements.			"

The 2nd expansion of Quake trips over bad level designYea!    More Quake is never bad First episode level set is great There is a dragon Meh!    Some of the levels are designed on tight corridors and switch hunting New weapons are basically just extra damage modes Most new enemies shoot explosives and explode on deathBleh!    Lots of exploding enemies and orges that shoot grenades in tight space means lots of deaths Switch hunting is not fun Hows it run: Still runs great out of the box, but will need some mods to clean up the graphics and support modern rezs.Gist: Unfortunately mission pack 2 fails to deliver on a fun expierience as the first set had done. This mainly falls on the fact that the endless tight spaces with losts of explosives and switch hunting. The first episode was lots of fun, but the second becomes a drag, excluding the maze level in the egyptian theme. A serious quake fan will enjoy this but otherwise stick with the first set. "

												Like mission pack 1, new bosses. Not sure if i remember, but both mission 1 and 2 has new weapons. If so, expect huge carnage.Like Mission pack 1, its interesting and would suggest buying it if you want more slaughtering and exploring new maps. Give it a go.			"

												The second mission pack for Quake surpassed the bar set by the already ambitious Scourge of Armagon by adding in additional ammo types for existing weapons as opposed to simply other weapons. The quality of the levels also nears Scourge of Armagon and the new enemy types fit in pretty well with the overall setting. Locales also switch to somewhat more Aztec and Egyptian flavours, which does wonders for the new levels.Overall, an excellent expansion pack for a classic game. You can't go wrong with it.			"

												As people have mentioned, yeah, the first Episode has a level in which you can't activate a lift. You'll be forced to use cheats. It's ok though, you can just ""sv_cheats 1"" and then ""fly"" your way up there. I know there's two floors, but it is possible to just rocket jump to the one in the middle, I did that before I considered pulling cheats :PAnyway, let's get to it.Better of the two expansions for QUAKE. Introduces ammo types for existing weapons. Nice. Very nice indeed.The first thing I noticed that was better than the other expansion was the eye-candy, amazing (for its time) map design. Holy moly. Not only is it pleasant to maneuver throughout the levels, but it's also just so good to look at them. Namely the Egypt-like levels. Maan I was impressed! Double nice.Soundtrack, as expected after the first expansion, very well done! Better than the original QUAKE for sure! (IMHO ofc)It does introduce new enemies, moreso than the first one. I'm happy with the amount.The only thing that I can see wrong with it (besides the bug above) is the difficulty spike between this one and the original QUAKE but I'm pretty sure that's to be expected, what with this being an expansion and all.So, yeah, I'd say that for an expansion, this is great! Even moreso for QUAKE. Avid QUAKE players should get this, all of them. It's very well done, with only one bug making it seem unplayable but bah, cheats are always meant for getting out of a game's buggy situation :PChallengers, big-time QUAKE players, ALL OF THEM. Get this. I'm serious.It's excellent. For what it is, of course. Have fun with it if you do get it! :D			"
