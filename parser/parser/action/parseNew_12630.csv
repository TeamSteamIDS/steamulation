												A decent Diablo clone. The combat animations look really nice, although sometimes enemies teleport to make contact with your strikes. I have had a few issues with it but nothing too bad. Just make sure you install the Nvidia Physx Legacy drivers before trying to play or you will most likley have issues.			"

												I really wanted to like this game and put a fair amount of time into it, but it's simply broken. Too many bugs and glitches. This was not tested or polished before being realeased. It is a very frustrating experience. Save your money and play something thst works. Even on sale it wasn't worth it. There are many better games of this genre too.			"
