												Way to ♥♥♥♥ up your sequel Crytek. Honestly, I blame EA more for it but still. The original Crysis had complex sandbox missions with multiple approaches and secondary objectives and plenty of bad♥♥♥♥♥suit powers. Crysis had an enjoyable cast of characters that I actually cared about. Crysis had varied vehicles, all of which were drive/flyable, Crysis had BLUE aliens that froze things. Crysis had a unique blend of strategic, tactical, intense, fun combat. Crysis had an original and interesting multiplayer.This is not Crysis. This is Call of Halofield 7: Future Warfare. They traded in EVERY SINGLE THING that made the first game great. Whether it's the linear as all hell story missions, the characters that were one-dimensional, cliche and predictable to the end, the dumbed-down nanosuit that somehow manages to feel less powerful than the marines you fight with, the HORRENDOUS checkpoint system, the aliens that are the exact opposite of the first game's, the lack of Psycho's presence, the removal of the ability to carry two primary weapons AND pistols AND use your fists (in fact, fists are completely gone), you can only use humvees/APCs instead of, oh, I don't know, TANKS and VTOLS and HELICOPTERS and other awesome♥♥♥♥♥♥ the bland/generic EVERYTHING, the multiplayer that is a complete rip-off of Call of Duty (and is now full of hackers that nobody does anything about), the list goes on.Anyways, the point is DON'T BUY THIS GAME. It is an insult to the original and in fact an insult to games in general.			"

												The main strength of the campaigns of Crysis is their sandbox, unrestricted nature, and Crysis 2 is a step back from Crysis 1 and Warhead in this regard, as you run through cities with closed-in walls instead of trek through jungles. However, each specific battle (and there were many times I felt like I was facing ""boss"" enemies) takes place in a pretty large area, so I never felt particularly restricted.The guns and combat are as crisp and satisfying as they were in the first two Crysis games. The suit's powers are now accessed with keyboard shortcuts, which makes their use feel more isolated, like sprinting in other games, and power jumps are accessed with a single button (holding down space), instead of requiring an activation of strength mode, making me feel less like I was operating a special suit, and more like I was just a superhero - it's less mechanical-feeling, for better or for worse, I guess.Towards the end of the campaign, I became extremely dependent on cloaking, which is overpowered. It's much faster to sneak around the enemy strongholds, going straight for the objectives, than it is to run roughshod over every enemy one-by-one. Maybe I became so objective-oriented because I was enthralled with the campaign (wishing to finish it as soon as possible), because, in other games, I generally take the time to kill every enemy I see.My most significant complaint about Crysis 2 is that, with the closed-in areas, specific, restricted routes are required to arrive at objectives within each mission, but there is no guide system (line on the ground) to show you where to go, which would have been appreciated at several points in the campaign, as I found myself trapped in rooms, going in circles trying to open doors that wouldn't budge. If you get stuck and resort to searching online for a level guide, you'll find many other people commenting that they were stuck at the same point as you.Dying can set you back annoyingly far. Don't die.The suit's upgradability is neat, but generally not integral, and unlikely to scope an individual's tactics.There aren't a lot of people playing Crysis 2's multiplayer, although there are more than enough to have a few big games going at all times. Still, this is a game to be bought for its campaign, and I highly doubt you will be left disappointed after completing it. It's exciting, engaging, and challenging, and ranks among my favorite 10-11 hour spans of gaming.			"

												Crysis 2, like the original is a first person shooter. The game was released in early 2011. It also follows on from the plot of Crysis 1 as well. Although you don't really need to have played the original in order to follow the story. Crysis 2 was also the first game to use the CryEngine 3.The game play has all of the regular FPS style features. You play the role of a Recon Marine, called Alcatraz. You are able to customize your weapons to match the situations you are in, as well as customizing your suite to the same too. Crysis 2 is set in New York City, which is often referred to by many as an urban jungle. This does however offer various different tactical options when it comes to planning attacks; allowing players to navigate between floors and buildings, and ruined buildings.  We also see a few changes in the Nanosuit used by our character too; this time you are able to use more than one suit power at a time, the strength and power modes have been combined into the same mode, and the stealth suit has been improved slightly.Crysis 2 has AMAZING graphics; this could easily pass as a game being released recently. If you put all of your settings up to full, you are going to be in amazement at how good this game looks. You will need a beefy rig to keep a steady 60 fps, but my oh my it is worth it.I sadly see no replay-ability in Crysis 2, there are the addition of a couple of difficulty modes, but to be honest; once you have played it the once, there is no reason to play it again. The single-player campaign is a decent length though - we are looking at a 18 hour long story mode which is very good for an FPS.Thankfully I had no technical issues with Crysis 2 (unlike I did have with the original), I was able to play with every graphical setting on ultra and still had 60 frames the whole time. The only thing I will mention is there is no longer any multiplayer support since GameSpy shut it's servers down in May 2014.If you enjoyed the first Crysis game, you will basically enjoy Crysis 2, it's the same just with even better graphics, more compelling story, and stellar FPS action and did I mention the amazing graphics? People may think £20 is a bit steep for a game of this age, however I am completely happy with this price as it almost fits into the £1/hour ratio. 1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Crysis 2 is a first-person shooter developed by Crytek using the Cry Engine 3.  It serves as a sequel to the critically acclaimed 2007 game Crysis and is the first game on the franchise to be released on the consoles as opposed to the first game that was PC exclusive.The game puts the player in the shoes of a U.S. Marine named Alcatraz whose team was sent to Manhattan to assist in rescuing civilians after an epidemic has infected the city.  Shortly after arrival, an unknown enemy attacked their Submarine, thus forcing the team to swim to the surface only to be gunned down by an Alien gunship.  Luckily, Laurence ""Prophet"" Barnes, former team leader of Raptor Team (Crysis 1) and known Nano-suit user, finds Alcatraz and bestows upon him his mission (along with the Nano-suit), before shooting himself in the head.  Alcatraz now faces a city at the brink of collapse due to the on-going battle between the US Military, Cell Paramilitary Forces and the Alien race called the Ceph.PROS:+ Beautiful graphics and User Interface+ Excellent sound quality, voice acting and music+ New mechanics like cover and quick activation keys (to access Nano-suit abilities for a more dynamic gameplay)+ Good story line that delves into the true nature of the Nano-suit and the Alien Invasion+ New customization options for the Nano-suit but...(See CON #1)+ Expanded weapon selection and upgrades+ Challenging but fair difficulties which highlights the use of each Nano-suit functions and upgrades+ Collectibles that expands the story+ Multiple ways to complete an objective despite the more linear mapsCONS:- Nano-suit upgrades are limited with some of them being outright better than the others- AI glitches at some areas, especially after reloading from the last checkpoint- Gun models take up a quarter of the screen (as if the gun was being held directly near Alcatraz's face)- Horrible FOV (Field of View)CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME.  Crysis 2, like its predecessor, has some of the most amazing graphical fidelity of its time which still holds up even today as it can be seen in its high-resolution textures, dynamic lighting, and beautifully crafted levels and sceneries.  The game introduces new mechanics such as a new cover system, Nano-suit upgrade system, expanded weapon selection, and a revamped Nano-suit ability activation mechanic. Despite the occasionally glitchy but challenging AI, you'll have an intense and action packed experience.The game could last you at least 8 hours of game time with your average difficulty setting and around 10 hours with the harder ones in single player.  Do you buy this at full price?  Sure but I highly RECOMMEND you buy this as a BUNDLE (Crysis Collection) which would include Crysis 1 and Warhead.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												If you've played a FPS in the last few years - then what Crysis 2 has to offer should not be mind blowing. Machine Guns, alien swarms, sniper rifles, grenades, headshots, shotguns, etc. Shoot a red barrel and it'll explode...yeah, it's all there. Personally, I would describe myself as quite ""over"" the FPS genre as a whole. However, that being said Crysis 2 manages to do all the typical FPS shooter mechanics extremely well... and throws in a couple of unique (although still not exactly not mind-blowing) little tweaks which is what makes this a really great game, and subsequently worth your time and money.First off the single player campaign is both lengthy and well paced. The story (I have not played the original) is solid for the archetypical ""Stop The Alien Scourge"" type of deal. Coupled with really tight controls and a good swatch of weapons - it makes for a rewarding experience. The whole differentiator for the Crysis series is the suit that you are in control of. You can enter two modes which change the way you face each challenge. Being able to go ""Stealth"" (vis 'a vis the Predator effect) means that you can approach enemies unseen. Upgrades to your suit eventually allow you to perform more stealth kills and even walk through crowds of enemies unseen.The second mode is an Armored mode. This basically allows you to go whole hog for a time and survive for a couple of hits longer then you normally would in a firefight. Doesn't make you invincible but it gives you a definite edge in both taking hits and dealing them out as well.You can also run and jump which is considered ""Power"" mode, but honestly it's just another thing to drain your energy so that you can't zip around and be super armored at the same time.Combining these two modes with a variety of customizable weapons, suit up-grades and tactical approaches provides a really interesting and robust way to tackle each encounter. You can literally approach the same scenario differently each time. I found the AI in this game both challenging and interesting at the same time. Enemies actually react to getting shot, hide well and as frustrating as a stealth kill that doesn't go unseen (although you think it should be) is - it's good that game doesn't mess around. There will be times when the AI just stands there or runs around sporadically but pound-4-pound it's more of an aberration than an annoying norm. And as someone who is generally kind of over this kind of game in particular that's high praise.If you're a fan of the FPS genre then this should definitely be something you play. If you've never played a Crysis game and are burnt out on the FPS shooter genre (like myself) - this is still a great way to pass a Sunday afternoon. The graphics are indeed great, the gameplay is really tight and overall it's a really fun game.			"

The following covers only the single player portion of Crysis 2.For many, the graphical powerhouse Crysis is more notorious for its tendency to bring even cutting edge PCs to their knees, than for its gameplay. While it offered tons of eye candy for those that could run it, the fact remained that most were forced to watch from the sidelines as it was simply impossible to play on anything but the best hardware. But all that changes with Crysis 2, a ruthlessly optimized machine that finally lets all those wondering about the series a chance to see what it’s all about. Unfortunately, it never lives up to its reputation in any way than being a pretty face, and once you look past the visuals quickly evaporates into a game I couldn’t wait to leave.Everything in Crysis 2 revolves around the Nanosuit, a secret military project which grants the user superhuman powers and provides both tactical and medical support. Armor, invisibility, super strength, and Nanovision (a combination of solar and night vision) round out the list of your abilities, and for the most part you are given free range over how you use them on the battlefield.This is what sets Crysis apart from other shooters. While still linear in progression, there is a lot more freedom in how you tackle situations than you are typically allowed in a modern FPS. Maybe you’ll choose to go in guns blazing, armor at its max as bullets ricochet off like water drops, or perhaps opt for a stealthier solution and sneak through the water ducks behind enemy lines. Experimentation is encouraged by way of a helpful visor reminiscent of Metroid Prime, which highlights enemies, weapons, and different points to begin your assault. When everything is working right Crysis 2 can be an incredibly rewarding and exhilarating experience where each fight becomes its own puzzle for you to unravel. The real problem though is that these moments are few and far between.One of the main reasons for this is every feature of the suit is tied into an energy gauge. When you use one, the meter depletes leaving you completely exposed and unable to cloak or use armor. While clearly designed to keep the game from becoming too easy, it also does a fantastic job of taking away from the feeling of being a super soldier developer Crytek tries so hard to create. Getting stuck in a firefight without the suit’s abilities is a common occurrence that almost always results in a near instant death, and even passive abilities such as meleeing enemies and sprinting are tied into the bar, which leaves you essentially helpless once it runs out. Using the energy bar to regulate abilities isn’t a bad idea in theory, but the execution is constantly working against the player to create a frustrating experience constantly stifling its own potential.The other big issue are the enormous amount of bugs, most of which revolve around the comically bad enemy AI. Cloaking highlights this most, as enemies are entirely oblivious to you when you are cloaked, going so far as to ignore you taking out their comrades mere inches away (I can only assume they are used to seeing their partners suddenly fall to the ground for impromptu naps). Fall into an enemy’s line of sight however and all of a sudden every living being knows where you are. Cloaking then acts as something of an on/off switch for enemy fire which comes grinding to a halt the second you cloke, a useful if entirely unrealistic way to exit a firefight that is equally unsatisfying. Finally you have the moments when the enemy AI simply breaks, getting stuck on geometry, running in endless circles, and all around being complete fools that are almost more fun to watch than to shoot, because truth be told shooting them just isn’t very fun. When everyone acts like a broken robot it’s hard to feel as if you’ve accomplished anything when you outsmart them, and for as intelligent as Crysis 2’s mechanics may be, every enemy you come up against seems to have drawn the short straw for brains.The narrative also left me wanting, hitting every cliche in the book and topping things off with some of the most abysmal writing and voice acting I’ve had to endure in a very long time. The interesting premise and opening scene where you, a soldier on his deathbed, are given the nanosuit and along with it the memories of its previous owner, is quickly swept aside in an endless stream of betrayals, convoluted twists, and an inability to ever explain what is really going on. I lost count of the number of times you lose consciousness, only to awake with your allies once again swapped and your motives changed. The writing is overly simplistic and juvenile, turning a lackluster plot into a cringe worthy affair. Rounding out the package is the flat voice acting that never could hit the right emotional tone nor bring any life to the script, but I suppose you can only do so much when given so little.But if there is one thing everyone is wanting and expecting from Crysis 2 it’s another benchmark graphical showcase, and in that regard it does not disappoint. The level of detail in each scene is astounding, with the lighting effects in particular standing even higher above the rest. Seeing the sun breaking through the dilapidated buildings of New York is awe inspiring, and although I won’t spoil them, the later half of the game is filled with some of the most impressive set pieces I have ever seen. Few games can match the visuals found in Crysis 2 even years after its release, and the amount of optimization wizardry done to ensure it runs well even on lower end machines is nothing short of impressive. Sound design is equally well done, with deafening explosions and gunfire which threaten to blow your subs and does more than anything else to provide a much needed wow-factor to the proceedings. The great score grabbed me right from the opening menu, setting the tone for the game and adding to the overall epic feel of the game.Undeniably beautiful, Crysis 2 has a lot of good ideas but does a poor job bringing them together. The bevy of bugs and glitches, most notably the terrible enemy AI, took almost all possible enjoyment out of firefights, and the few instances where the game actually worked as intended only further displayed just how much wasted potential was left on the table. What we are left with is a below average shooter wrapped in an extremely pretty package, but one that can’t hide the dull and lifeless game underneath. It’s hard to dislike something that throws so much eye candy at you, but in this case beauty is only skin deep.Disclaimer: If you are curious why my gametime is so low, it's for the fact I originally played Crysis 2 on the Xbox 360. However my time with the PC version has confirmed that it is very much the same game, aside from the obvious graphical upgrade. If you find anything I said to be inaccurate, let me know and I will look into it and update my review accordingly.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

Action packed and beautiful to look at, but too linear for its own good.Crysis 2 was developed by Crytek Studios and released by Electronic Arts in March 2011. Four yours earlier, the same developers scored a huge success with the first game in the series, which was well-known at its time of release to be the most demanding pc game ever made. But apart from being a technical masterpiece, pushing graphics to a lever far beyond anything which had been yet achieved, the original Crysis also offered good gunplay in a fairly big theater of operations. While not being without some problems, the game impressed me and so I started playing Crysis 2 with high expectations.And that's probably exactly where the problems started: from the beginning, I compared this game to its predecessor. And so I expected a gorgeous looking, extremely demanding shooter within a rather open world, allowing for several routes to achieving one's objectives. Crysis 2 definitely managed to impress me on the visual and technical side: visually it offers anything one could wish for, taking into account the game was released over five years ago. The setting has completely shifted from the lush jungle of the first game to an impressive rendering of New York devastated by war. Although visually still impressive, with tons of details and lots of smoke and debris, the urban setting does diminish the large-scale feeling of the first game quite dramatically, and the different levels felt more constricted and definitely a lot smaller.From a purely technical point of view, this game still stands firm, although it does show that it was a console port, rather than a game originally developed for pc. The controls are less fluid and intuitive, and seem geared towards playing with an xbox controller. This was actually the first first-person shooter I've ever played with my controller – normally, I definitely prefer keyboard and mouse in this type of games. But in this case, it simply offered better and more naturally laid out controls. As far as graphical settings go – often a problem with a game first developed for consoles: they were fine, offering enough possibilites to crank up the eye-candy to stunning levels and giving (just) enough options to scale the settings for those wanting to do so. It's not the most demanding game out there anymore, but it still can tax any medium-range system: don't expect it to run at full HD on the ultra preset with anything less than a recent, fast i3 and a good midrange gpu. Given the fact that the game has been used so often as a benchmark for computer systems and graphics cards, I was slightly disappointed not to find some sort if benchmarking tool included, but that's a very minor issue.Much more problematic is the complete transformation as far as the actual gameplay goes. Gone are the open areas where there are several, often radically different, routes to one's objectives. Instead, Crysis 2 offers a series of set pieces: medium-scaled area's with primary and (sometimes) secondary objectives with one or two lines of approach. By using the ""tactical mode"" of your high-tech suit (more about this in a minute), you can scan the battlefield for enemies, supply stashes, but also for ""tactical options"", such as the ideal route if going for a stealth approach or the way to go if you want to flank the enemy. In other words: the game wants to hold you by the hand as much as possible! While this might be ok in a very linear first-person horror game, where scripted sequences are of the essence, it is in no way desired in a first-person shooter. I often tried to ignore the tactical suggestions, but mostly found out that there were no viable alternative routes, or that another approach than the one suggested almost inevitably resulted in a quick death. And with its horrendous system of saving only at set (and very irregular) waypoints, dying is something you definitely want to avoid in this game.Fortunately, not all is bad: the story definitely kept my interest throughout the game and often made me persist through a difficult section. It's not a great story – there are a lot of unbelievable plot-twists and too often a mission ends rahter abruptly – but it's better than in most ""super human rescues the world from bad guys and aliens""-games. The most interesting aspect of the game is actually the special combat suit (the nanosuit) which you use as the player throughout the game. Just like in the original Crysis this suit offers several modes of operation: strength, armor & cloak – the last one of course ideal for a stealth-approach. Since I like being stealthy, the cloak-mode turned out to be my best friend, but it's also a tad overpowered if used correctly. The nanosuit can be upgraded during the game with energy provided by killing aliens, but those upgrades often felt tucked-on and didn't offer anything really new.As far as the actual gunplay goes, Crysis 2 surely delivers big time. There are a lot of different, often high-tech weapons out there to try out, and after some playing around with them they proved to be very well balanced and offering more than enough firepower for any chosen playstyle. Especially the energy-based weapons, ideal for mowing down aliens, were great fun to use. In the end, I did enjoy this game, if taken on its own merits: I sneaked up on several guards from behind, killed them with my knife, dashed for cover when I ran out of energy for the cloak mode only to be discovered by an alien who then started to throw emp-grenades at me. Very often I could just hang on in a firefight, having to make split-second decisions in order to survive; at other points, I could move forward at leisure, popping in and out of cloak mode. It was great fun, but it wasn't a gaming experience which I'll remember for years to come.Cautiously recommended: don't compare it to the original game, but enjoy it as a decent first-person shooter. And crank up the volume: the music is fantastic. "

												Ever since its initial release in late 2007, Crysis has been touted as one of the most visually impressive games to ever to be released on the PC. But no one really talks about the gameplay too much. That could have something to do with the fact that in order to experience the wonder of said graphics and not just look on in awe as demo reels were shoved down your gullet, you needed the world's fanciest PC gaming rig. Still, there were plenty of people who did have a good enough computer to run Crysis and even more who wanted it to be available on the home consoles as well.Crysis 2 made that nanosuit-boosted leap through the air to the console market in a brilliant and impressive manner.For part two, the fight has moved from the imaginary island of Lingshan to the very real New York City; the only difference being that in this version of The Big Apple, there's a virus going around that melts people into a pile of goo and an invasion from some very squid-like alien beings. It's now up to you as the man in the fancy nanosuit to give these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s a run for their money. This time around, though, instead of just wandering around an open world and blowing all the pretty bits up, you're guided through a level-based experience that keeps the plot fluid and creates a more streamlined gaming experience.Somehow the team over at Crytek has found a way to make their sequel just as visually remarkable as the original and without the need to spend a fortune on a fancy new video card and extra RAM.The desolated streets of Manhattan have an eerie presence about them. The once bustling metropolis has a sense of recent and sudden abandon written all over it, like everyone just stopped what they were doing and disappeared. It's the most ""living"" dead city I've ever seen in a game. Anyone that's ever been to the five burroughs of NYC will probably agree with me that the essence of the city has been captured in the graphics.From a visual standpoint, the whole vibe of the game is Planet of the Apes meets Escape from New York while the gameplay itself is more Halo meets Metal Gear Solid. You can choose to go balls-out guns-a-blazing through every level like a suicidal badass, all the while utilizing the suit's armor mode much in the same way a Master Chief would, or you can use the suit's stealth mod e to sneak by the enemy undetected, creep behind him, and stab him in the head like a sneaky Snake might. It's up to you how you want to carry out missions and you're given a variety of ways to deal with situations. You could even skip combat all together and just sneak around everything if you're good enough or just bored with fighting. Obviously, there will be points where fights are unavoidable, along with some moments where you're forced to drive vehicles and run over stuff while blowing other stuff up, but overall Crysis 2 does a good job of letting you choose how to handle everything in your own way.As you progress, you can customize your nanosuit to better fit your playing style whether it be for longer lasting stealth mode, quieter footsteps, or a flying stomp attack to get the drop on enemies.For the most part, the AI does a good job of not letting you walk all over them, but there are a few times where I found myself blindly punching the crap out of my opponents with the armor mode engaged to get out of situations.The plot is also a bit boiler-plate and most of the shocks or twists are pretty easy to see coming. But even though you'll figure out that Darth Vader is Luke's father long before you should, there are still some very surprising things in store for fans of the series, though most of them seem to occur earlier rather than later in the plot.Crysis 2 has done an amazing thing here. It's a sequel that while borrowing heavily from the first Crysis, plays out absolutely nothing like it and creates its own standalone experience.This is one of the few games that dramatically enhances its previous installment.

Great gameplay and beautiful scenery with a terrible (bad) scenario!That is basically Crysis 2 in one sentence. But let's go a bit further!The good, the bad and the ugly--, I mean the derp.	The good :It's gameplay.The gameplay is what makes this game so fun to play. I'm not a huge fps fan of brainless killing and I prefer my fps to be intelligent and have a good and long interesting story. This one compensate the story part by it's very entertaining gameplay and huge variety of weapons (WICH IS GOOD FOR A FPS AM I RIGHT?). I expected this game to be more like a derp shooter where you kill everything, but I actually quite enjoyed the stealth part. But of course, the gunplay is also great.The stealth part is absolutely not forced nor necessary, but I found it the most interesting part for me. Hearing the soldiers screaming and being all scared is a sadist joy that I don't hide. It just feels really good to sneak around all stealthy with our superior armor and killing them in style.Speaking of the soldiers, there are 2 main enemies in this game. Human soldiers, and Aliens. The gameplay is quite different when facing them. When you fight soldiers, you feel like... a hunter, a predator hunting his prey. And every kills is really rewarding as you feel powerful. Op even. And feeling powerful is a good feeling (because the game is not that easy on hardest difficulty!).When facing the aliens, it's quite the opposite. They are numerous, strong and almost scary. This time I often choose to hide. Not because I enjoy stabbing them in the back, but because I'm genuinely scared to face them and their superiority. In this case, I feel like the hunted. Aliens also have some huge boss and they are pretty challenging.But all this talk about the weapons would not be enough if we don't talk about the ARMOR! Because yes, the armor has such a big role in this game. It's actually it's core mechanism. Other than having the most badass voice you ever heard for an armor, it is also packed with lot of skills and uppgrades. Stealth, superior armor, thermal vision, scanning abilities, superior jump... There are a lot of differents functions. The game is made so that you will need them at least once during the course of the game at some key parts. For instance, I often find thermal vision to be more of a gadget in most games, but here it feels really good to be able to see in heavy smoke or being able to see stealth opponents... But of course, they are usefull for the whole duration of the playthrough. Never made useless.How do you uppgrade your armor by the way...? Well, here is an interesting way of working. You get more energy by killing aliens! Seems easy right? But aren't they the kind of enemies you would rather avoid? Yes! That's the trick. It's easier to avoid them, but more rewarding to actually kill them!The graphics :Crysis 2 has always be known for being a very demanding game when it was out in 2011. And... well, even after 4 years the game is still insanely beautiful. It's not just that it is plainly  ""looking good""  but, the scenery and the actions are absolutely brillants, unique and gorgeous. You will see some scenes in this game that you never saw before in any other games. New York having a tsunami? Huge tentacle robot coming through the ground and destroying the city? Flying island? Absolutely epic collapsing of buildings and huge explosions? Yes, this game has them all and it looks astonishing.Miscs :You can also customize your weapons a little bit. Always nice to have. The game lenght is pretty good if you play a bit more stealth wise and play on hardest difficulty. I would say around 17hours for me since steam misses a few hours.The bad :It's story.Oh boy... oh boy. Well, where to start? The basic story is that Aliens are attacking earth and you are a marine in New York that is going to fight them back.And well, that's it! Enjoy!No, actualy there is a bit more. But it's just extremely cliché and uninteresting, and mostly poorly excecuted. They tried to put some ""conspiracy"" and ""betrayals"", but the characters are so stereotyped, blank and annoying that you just can't care about what is happening to them and the story. Your own character has absolutely 0 charisma and personnality. The only ""interesting character"" is actually... your armor. Yup!The game also have a kind of repeating scenario for the whole game. Something like I'm alone >>> I found my crew! >>>  I lost them and I'm almost dead D:  >>>  REPEAT! >>>  I'm alone >>>  Another crew found me! The Ai :The ai has in my opinion only one and major flaw. They kind of always know where you are even if they don't see you. This is extremely annoying and is a stupid way to try to artificialy increase the difficulty. How does this stupid functionality works? It's simple, even if they never see you or hear you, the ai will tend to move where you are and either, search, pattrol, or stand there like nothing. It makes them finding you unfunny and not ""deserved"". This almost always happens with the humans ai. Rarely with the aliens though.The design :Even though the aliens are looking great, they have a major flaw. Most of them looks very close to each other so it's very hard to know if it's a ""basic grunt"", or one very advanced type of aliens. Only a few ones have really unique look.The army feels :Here is a personal opinion. It's simple, if you love american army stuff, you will like the general feeling of the interraction with your character. If you don't, it's pretty annoying. This game has a ""oh wow army is awesome we are heroes"" feels and people seems proud to call you ""marine"", or ""soldier"" at each possiblities and you know it's done because they think it's ""awesome to hear it"", and it keep showing the american flags very often and other details like this. Also you're pretty much the most cliché ""super soldier hero"" character you can think of.The derp :Some stuff in this game are neither impressive nor bad. Like the music. It's not bad, but there are not many and seem to repeat themselves. If you are interested in the multiplayer, know that it's not working anymore. I didn't have any glitches, expect a few enemies falling from where they were (like next to a cliff or on a window). It was more funny that annoying. I heard there are modding with this game, but I didn't try it.Conclusion :If you're a huge fps fan, just take it. I think it's a good game, but being now an old game with such heavy competitors.., I only reccomend it on sale for everyone else. However the game is very fun to play... and actually, isn't that the most important?			"

												To be honest, I never liked Crysis. I always looked at it as a techdemo. It was one of those games that had numerous glitches - BSODs and audio glitches were frequent and I do not remember any other games with which I was having similar issues at the time. Also, my rig surpassed the system requirements for the game so I never understood what could have caused these issues. But the various websites and forums on the internet confirmed the same.In any case, the jungle environment was already familiar following Crytek's Far Cry. So, when the news came that the sequel to Crysis would take place in New York (now an ""urban jungle""), I looked forward to seeing and playing it. The game delivered: the destroyed cityscape of Manhattan looks superb thanks to CryEngine 3. We are to navigate between the floors of destroyed buildings and combat on the city streets is common. Finally, the aliens appear in the form of regular soldiers, too - it's not just the big monsters that you need to fight like in the first part.As for gameplay, the protagonist's nano suit has been streamlined. Strength and speed modes are now combined. We can now perform silent takedowns so following a stealthy playing mode is more rewarding. Upgrading the suit's features is a possibility based on the alien kills we perform - this is an unnecessary role playing section of the game but it does not represent any issues.Overall, I was satisfied with the sequel. Single player campaign lasts for 12-13 hours which is quite long these days. Cutscenes are frequent and Hans Zimmer's excellent score helps us with the immersion into the world of Crysis. Too bad that starting from June multiplayer mode will be unavailable for good (following the announcement of GameSpy), so, should it be discounted, it should be purchased with only the single player experience in mind.

												This is a great game! Finished the whole game in 11hrs.I will do some pros and cons for the gamePROS-The graphics are awesome-The gameplay doesn't get repetitive-Great story, picks up some years after the events on the Crysis and Crysis Warhead-So many weapons and upgrades for them-Couple of bugs, here and there. Nothing game-breaking, graphical bugs-Great cutscenes-Many collectible items like souvenirs, dog tags, emails and car keys-Enemies and allies have a variety of models, weapons which they use and the AI is pretty good-Small community still aliveCONS-The Multiplayer is broken, there are some fixes on the internet but I don't plan on fixing it right now(maybe in the future)-Low number of vehicle variety-You don't get that free roam feeling like on Crysis and Crysis WarheadI recommend this game.

												An overall great game with some shortcomings.I gotta say I really enjoyed Crysis 2. I have not played much of Crysis 1. So, playing C2 was an amazing experience.What I liked :1) The graphics & details that make up the environment.2) Nanosuit modes.3) Storyline ( although it's short ).4) Gameplay.5) Nanosuit upgradation with catalysts. 6) Excellent alien bodies with great warships.What I disliked :1) Short story. I finished the story in under 6 hrs of play time.2) Not many weapons.3) No boss alien in the end ( It's just a whole lot of casual aliens spawning in the end, no boss ).4) Cannot use alien weapons ( I think C3 has this feature ). 5) Multiplayer. It's kinda weird to me. Not much of a 'variation' in multiplayer. 6) You can carry only 2 weapons at a time ( excluding heavy weapons like JAW etc ). And so there is nothing like ""side-arm"" in secondary weapons. So, two primary guns and you cannot carry any pistol with it. So, given the things ""I"" liked the game is really worth it. Pros definitely overcome the cons. Better give it a try ;) I'd rate it 8/10.			"

												Even if I'm giving it thumb down I could recommend this game to certain people. Its a decent shooter, with nice graphics, and some great moments.However, personally, I didn't like it very much, and theres a lot of reasons for that. Comparing to its predecessor it has improved story, multiplayer, and alien design, but overall, original was a far better game (but still far from my favourite game). Original Crysis was obviously a game designed with PC in mind, and you could see that in every aspect of it - graphics, huge levels, level of destruction, and other stuff. It was ported to consoles years later, but in Crysis 2 version of engine, and with no surprise. Instead in the jungle on islands Crysis moved to the jungle on concrete, how they call New York, and very popular thing to say during this game's advertisement period. Levels are now far more stiff. Here and there you may stumble upon some more open area, but rarely, soon after you will return to your usual corridor roam. No matter how wide its corridors are, corridor shooter is still a corridor shooter. Initially, it came with only dx9 assets. It got dx11 facelift later, but even after that you can still see a lot of hidious textures, especially on the walls. Here and there you may break some glass, TV screen or a vase, but generally environment is indistructible. You can use carboard boxes as a solid cover or even hide behind cellophane wall. Which is just ridiculous comparing to the original, where you could level down structures, or even cut down the trees with shooting. But this is just a nitpicking, mostly. Despite all of that, even without highres textures, its a pretty looking game, theres no doubt about it.AI in this game is brain-dead, and I'm not even exaggerating. You may not notice it initially, because of the sheer numbers of opponents you'll be facing most of the time. But sooner or later you have to see how they love that cover... They love it so much that they won't move from it even if you stand right before them, or even after putting a bullet in their body. It happens that they forget about you after you run past them, you or they hide behind the cover, or ignoring the fight which happened just couple of metters behind them. Sometimes they won't acknowledge your presence until you shoot them, even if you are in the open in front of them, in their sight range. Other hilarious stuff includes your marine ally getting killed because he accidentally stopped where scripted event occured and jeep runned over him, killing their colleagues (or even themselves) with their own grenades, blowing themselves up after accidentally shooting the red barrel behind which they were hidding...But what I hate the most is that camera movement. PC designed original had nice and smooth aiming, unlike Crysis 2. Its not that bad, but no matter how much I'm tweaking mouse sensitivity, I just can't get rid of that feeling like I'm moving controller thumbstick, and not a mouse. Like something drags me down. Lowering settings to get some extra frames doesn't help either (game runs smooth on highest settings anyways). In SP with laughtable AI its tolerable, but in MP its a killer. Yet another sign of its console design. Similar problem I had with Halo 2 PC port, or Bioshock Infinite, yet another console-infested game.As I said, story is better this time, but again - nothing for an Oscar. You are some US Marine grunt, infiltrating New York via sub with your team. But soon hell breaks loose after alien incursion, your whole team gets killed, and you are saved by Prophet, character from the first game. You will see him just  briefly at the beginning, he is infected by the alien virus, and can't last much longer. He gives you his nano-suit, and puts a bullet in his own head to break the link with the suit. But before that gives you the order to find certain scientist, that guy who your team supposed to find anyways. For some reason, your character doesn't say a single word for the whole durration of the game, not even ""I'm not Prophet, God damnit!"" to all those people trying to murder him screaming ""Its Prophet!"", but eh.Nano-suit went through some changes. You still have the option of modding weapons with various attachements, and armor and cloak modes are working as you used to. There's an additional option: by eliminating filthy xenos you can collect nano-catalyst points from their dead bodies (aliens are coming in several types, and how much you get depends from the type), and you can use them to upgrade your suit. Abilities are divided into 4 classes, with 3 potential upgrades for each, and only one upgrade at the time can be chosen per class, (such as improved health and energy regeneration, improvements for cloaking, bullet tracing, etc), and in that way it gives you certain amount of customisation. If you have enough patience you can easily farm catalysts on certain locations, where  you can just run around and melee alien grunts, since they are no challenge anyways. Strenght and speed modes are now combined into one ""Power"" mode and its active all the time. High jumping, grabbing and kicking your opponents/items, and running is using your suit energy. While for strenght mode it makes some sense, why someone decided that simple sprinting is using your suit energy - I really have no idea. Not to mention that running in this game is on par with walking in majority of other games, and walking is painfully slow, plus when we combine that with console treated aiming... Since levels are smaller and far more linear now, designers probably thought there wasn't any need for that super-dash, or normal walking. Maybe its more realistic that way, and I'm nitpicking again, but I'm playing games for fun mostly, not for their realism (as much as the game with setting like this can relly on realism).MP is fairly basic, and fun for a while, but nothing that kept me for too long. Btw, you are required to create a 3rd party account, since this game doesn't use Steamworks. Since MP in this game is almost dead, ranked matching is not an option if you plan to play at all, so you are stuck with the custom server browser, which often results in playing with far more leveled players than you, with far better unlocks and perks (besides regular aim-bot users). You can play either in nano-suits, or as regular troopers. Playing with nano-suits is not particulary fun, its just a bunch of ghosts shooting each other, because cloaking is far too often used, and no wonder - you are literally invisible. But even without it its hard to spot someone most of the time, because design of uniforms easily blends with the envronment. Besides several pre-determined classes, with your unlocks you can create your own custom loadout, only one is available at the beginning, and if you bother to play enough you can unlock more by leveling. EDIT: With Gamespy service shutting down Crysis 1 and 2 are losing their MP support on the PC, so you are only stuck with the SP from now on.And lastly, I have to mention great sound assets, and fantastic soundtrack. You can unlock it completelly in extras by finishing campaign levels, so nothing costs you to give it a try. I recommend tracks ""SOS New York"", ""Chase"", ""Rampage"" and ""One Way In"".			"

												There is very little to say about Crysis 2 that hasn't already been said.If you are a gamer and you've never played this game, you will be surprised to be informed that you have actually played this game. There are many tropes and trends in modern gaming that have their roots in the Crysis Series, some only in Crysis and some only in Crysis 2 but they are there.That said, it's not entirely a stimulating exerperience playing Crysis 2 in 2016 when this review was written, but as I said with my BioShock review, should you have an interest in video game history this and it's predecessor holds a firm slot in the Hall of Fame of Genre Defining games and you may find something in it.Thank you for defining modern gaming, Crysis 2.

												I haven't played a single Crysis game, but I saw this game was on a discount so I thought why not. I think this game's story is decent. It's a basic story where aliens from the first game and arrive in New York. You play as a Marine, Alcatraz, who wears the Nanosuit and goes on a mission to defeat the aliens, evacuate New York with your fellow Marines, all while fighting off a PMC called C.E.L.L.So gameplay wise, it's good. You have the armor abilities that are really cool, but remind me a bit of Halo. They are Cloak and armor. Also, before you enter a combat section. Your computer tells you ""Tactical Options Availble"", where you seek the different ways to approach it. You acn go in guns blazing or sneak around the enemies.The sound design in this game is excellent. The noise, explosions and music all fit the game. But the way the character models move looks clunky sometimes, and the voice acting of Nathan Gould is a bit funny to me. Especially when his character model looks like a nut-case.So overall, I give this game a 7/10. If you're a fan of FPS, pick this game up now and go and play it.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Crytek StudiosPublishers: Electronic ArtsInitial release: Mar 2011Genre: FPS, Action#Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationThis is a Far Cry from the original Crysis.. is that not funny? Too soon? Anyways..Let me explain first by telling you why Crysis 1 was far more than a tech demo.  It was what marketing teams now popularly refer to as yielding something know as “emergent gameplay” Sure, I'll grant you it was a technical showpiece when real time shadows on foliage was ground breaking not only for technical achievement but also for your wallet regarding the new GPU you'll need to run it properly. There was real strategy to be had while playing Crysis. From cloaking yourself, sneaking behind someone and grabbing them by the throat, switching to strength mode and throwing them off a cliff. To tanking and switching in between maximum armor, strength and speed to jump over a fence and blasting unsuspecting fools with an automatic shotgun or on the fly switching between different scopes, applying a silencer, crouching, taking aim (maximum strength, to steady fire) and sniping on the fringe of a base. These are just a small percentage of what the game allowed you to do. All this was combined with a huge open terrain of varying topography. All of this is exchanged for a easy to grasp corridor shooter in Crysis 2. Now, don't get me wrong I love a good corridor shooter but the freedom of play granted in 1 turns the “freedom” into clearly labeled things within your visor such as get up high and snipe or stealth through the sewers, leaving any guesswork or self discovery out of the picture. I won't harp on the story of either as I don't think either are truly interesting however nor are they offensive. They are just or sort of latent. Regardless I still prefer the original narratively speaking because I believe the pacing to be a lot better as well as the mystery of what exactly is going on on the island. This is feels more like where else can we take this idea we started with. After all this reasoning as to why I like Crysis 1 better. Crysis 2 is still worth playing. I haven't played the multiplayer but I don't play much multiplayer anything so that info is better commented on by someone else. What I can say is the gunplay feels great, combined with the exo suits abilities. I'm sure the multiplayer is as fun and competent as the campaign and certainly will extend the life if that sort of thing floats your boat.Follow my curation for more "

Posted: November 27, 2013
												Reality 2.0. A review from New York.There is this morbid fascination with seeing New York destroyed in movies. This game does just that and does it really well.The graphics.Nothing to say here. Cry Engine 3 is going to dominate the graphics department until Frostbite 2 comes out I guess. It's going to be an interesting stand off. I did however notice some inconsistencies with water. Most water still looks great. However, some parts of the water are just outright consolish looking. As I was playing the game, I found myself constantly being distracted by the graphics whilst I was getting shot at which was annoying. However, when you are invisible, you still cast a shadow and your floating gun is also visible to the enemy. Now the game gives you the option to run around in third-person view.The story:Well, you still play as a mute character named 'Alcatraz'. Nomad actually had a voice. And they do attempt to tie in the story with the first game, somewhat. But hey, on the positive note, you can actually cast a shadow and you have legs this time around.The locations:There are 19 missions. You start off at Battery park and then you advance towards the downtown area of the city through the East side. You will visit many historic locations and some of them are going to be blown up. The scale of the buildings in the game and reality is almost 1:1. One thing is that the skyscrapers in the background are randomly picked. Apparently the devs did not wish to go through more trouble of placing the real skyscrapers in the corresponding locations. Let's get one thing straight. This is not a sandbox game. At the end of the day, you are given an area that you have to navigate through to get to the next check point. So even though that makes the game linear, the fact that there are several approaches to your destination kind of makes the city your playground. I loved seeing the old closed off Brooklyn Bridge 6 train subway stop. They have only recently re-opened it by the way.The NYC subway maps that are in the game are wrong though, not to mention some geographical errors. The devs also put the train tracks on the streets, and NYC does not have those except for the old abandoned old track that was delivering coal to a plant a hundred years ago; now it is a museum.But at least the intersecting streets and historical locations are correct.The game does give you a significant area to run around when you approach the Grand Central terminal, otherwise the entire game consists of isolated carefully constrained few blocks that you have to go through.The bottom line is that, it is not really New York as I hoped to see it, but it is New York enough.Times Square has been pulled off very well, but of course, most of its blocked up by the mysterious US Army cement blocks, seriously? The US army can barricade NYC in the matter of hours of alien attack with thousands of these blocks?Hint, when you find the head of the Statue of Liberty, go inside of it.The sound:The sound is great. Distant shots, shouts, explosions, alien growls, your gun shots - it's all there. Can't comment on the music however, since it ruins the immersion for me, no music necessary.The gameplay:Extremely smooth. Quick load times as usual, responsive keyboard and mouse. The recoil is extremely realistic, unlike other FPS games. Even throwing a grenade is bound to give your screen a shake. They slightly augmented the role of the nano suit here. This time, the energy regenerates much faster. Not only that, the energy regenerates no matter what. So even if you are swimming, your energy will eventually recharge even if you do not surface. Needless to say, that makes the game easier than the first one in that department. There is also a cover system even though I didn't use it a lot. It is reminiscent of the Killzone franchise, wherein you remain in cover and you are able to peek out and see what's going on ahead, instead of being able to see everything if you were playing a third person shooter.You can still grab the aliens by their throat and choose to either knife them, throw them or use them for cover. But you can't just take any alien by its throat. You have to either soften the alien and pump it full of lead first or punch it a few times, then you have the option to grab the poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Sliding. Not really that useful but it's nice to have the ability.The ability to climb up if you just can't reach that ledge. I found myself jumping from building to building just to grab onto the ledge and pull myself up.The strong kick. Useful in kicking large things around.You can upgrade your suit and your weapons based on your progress in the game and how many enemies you killed.Introducing the nano vision. No more night vision. This time, you can see traces of water vapor or traces of heat or enemies while everything else on the screen remains black and white.The game gives you the option to bypass your enemies completely, and most of the time you can pull that off.There is some driving, but it only last a few seconds at a time.The ammo caches are scattered throughout the city. So even though you cannot carry as much ammo at a time, you will easily find ammo elsewhere.There are a few types of aliens, but most of them are infantry. You will find some big fat ones and a tripod. You will also see a couple of cloaking aliens.Also, there really aren't that many enemies to fight in the game. In total, you will perhaps only kill around 150 foes. On one side, it will never get frustrating of getting swarmed by aliens and dying constantly. There is always plenty of room to maneuver. On the other side, it does not really feel like there's a lot of fighting going on. There's a couple of companies of the Army and the Marines roaming the city and there is only a handful of aliens.The weapons:The weapons are plenty, probably as many as in Crysis:Warhead. The ones are also introduced. I am only happy to once again comment on the realistic recoil of all weapons.The negatives:1. The aliens aren't really that menacing, but they do look like the aliens from Battle:Los Angeles.2. The invasion does not really feel like a real invasion, but a series of isolated skirmishes.3. Fighting aliens is a lot like fighting humans, not that I know what it would feel like fighting aliens. But regardless, they do take cover, they do retreat and they don't really have any special abilities.4. There is a slight re-spawn of enemies but not anything like in Call of Duty series.5. The game is not an exact replica of New York City. Maybe only 50%-60%.6. There are some bugs there and there especially with the AI. The AI is good for the most part. But this one time I was laughing my♥♥♥♥♥off when I saw an enemy soldier jump over obstacles when he actually tripped over the obstacle and fell head down and then got up. I don't know if that was just a crazy physics' engine bug or actually part of the AI algorithm that has a % 0.00001 chance of this happening.Finally, the production values are off the charts and there really is no good reason why you shouldn't buy this game. And I haven't even played the multiplayer yet.			"

On the other hand, if you just want a game that looks beautiful and you love singleplayer, this is the game for you. It has a very interesting feel and a pretty good plot line (You must have a hardy pc especially with the ultra graphics mod :). ) Due to the fact that multiplayer is gone I will have to give it a thumbs down :(			"

												I bought this game when it came out on the Xbox 360 in 2011 (which lets face it was a historical high point in the history of gaming what with this and Skyrim). I played it through three times. FFwd to 2014, I buy an uber-PC for gaming and get Crysis 1 2 and 3 in a deal. I just finished Crysis 2 for the second time on the PC.This is one of the best games I have ever played. Conceptually it is a masterpeice. Alien invaders, hostile humans, friendly humans, a terrific and engaging plot with high standards in terms of the script and voice acting. The level design is fantastic with an openess which allows many paths through areas and a game mechanic that permits stealth or force as an approach. The cutscenes do nothing to break the immersion and the scale of events around the player create a feeling of being caught up in something Earth shaking. Literally.If there was one game that I would hold up as an example to developers of How to Make Computer Games, Crysis 2 would be it. This would be in my top five games of all time. If you have never played it I cannot recommend it enough.			"

												I have to admit I prefer this one over the first Crysis. Probably I like city more than jungle. Some would say that it's not so free as first one but I simply don't care. Also I think that switching suits modes is better. About story...it's FPS so I don't need to have any storytelling, lot of people say that it has great story so believe them. ;) I enjoyed almost every chapter from mine 9 hours long playthrough, somewhere in the middle of the game I got bored but nothing serious. If you didn't appreciate first Crysis, just try this one and maybe you like it more, like me. Besides great graphics there is also excellent music. Very good FPS.			"

												I can't say that I'm dissapointed by this game, I wasn't impressed.The story is quite lame(especially when comparing to Crysis 1 and Warhead), the nanosuit was toned down(no speed and strength modes) which is a shame since no one asked for a simplified version of the nanosuit. The levels were also scaled down from the huge open world levels from Crysis to corridor levels which allow only one approach to the objective most of the time. The multiplayer also change to fit the traditional ""Call of Duty formula"".Overall, Crytek really dissapointed me by changing the pace of the game, but if you are looking for a multiplayer shooter with a nice story, it's worth a visit.

												I barely write reviews, but I figure this one was worth it. for $5.99, I finished the single player campaign in one sitting. The 8 hours, it was amazing. About $.75 per hour, but i'll probably never touch it again but the pros are:1. Gameplay (single player) (8/10)   i. Amazing combat engine, love the suit.   ii. You will use stealth mode for almost the entire game   iii. Ability to turn up the difficulty at anytime, which is fantastic.2. The storyline (8/10)   i. It was very captivating, played through and read the synopsis.3. Graphics (9/10)   i. I currently run the game on a 1440 monitor with an r7 graphics card, ran smooth as eggs,   ii. amazing graphics and visuals, no lag, on ultra.4. Multiplayer (0/10)   i. heard the servers are going down, haven't attempted to play it. so 0 rating.Final rating 7.5/10 worth $6 bucks, would not spend anymore than that.			"

												Makes Call of Duty Infinite Warfare suck even more. Excellent action scenes that you can ""try"" to approach them using stealth, make no mistake though, this ain't no MGS. Outstanding music score. The story is something I did not really care about, the only thing you need to know is that there's an alien invasion and you have a bad♥♥♥♥♥suit to protect you.

												It is rarely that I have played an FPS that managed to impress me and keep me on the edge of my seat with its action and at the same time completely impress me with its storyline. Mind you Crysis storyline might seem generic and cliche as they come and there's a definitely an element of truth to that.Having played this game in 2016, almost 5 years after its release, I can certainly say that if you told me this was a 2016 game I've would have believed you. Sure the player models might seem a little stiff and dated, especially in a gaming era where facial animations are scrutinized constantly and Crysis 2 is worthy of complaints in that matter, the textures and the environment however still look as beautiful as ever. The times of old memes (WILL IT RUN CRYSIS) are perhaps gone, but this game is certainly worthy. Still looks good, especially in the maximum edition where it features the High Res textures.Crysis 2 gameplay is also pretty damn good. There's smooth movement, decent aiming, the action flows greatly and constantly at your own pace; you can take a stealth route to eliminating your enemies or you can go guns blazing. Naturally in higher difficulites a proper combination of both strategies will net you a quite satisfying and intense experience. The gunplay is great, there's a variety of different weapons to use, each one with their own stats and modifications. Don't worry, it's super simple to customize your weapon and you can do it on the spot too! No need to go back to a bench/whatever to modify your gun.You want to stealth this part of the mission? Add a silencer and a scope. You want to fire more bullets? Add extended clip. You want a secondary function to your primary weapon? Add a grenade launcher! It is important to note that not all weapons have the same modifications and some unique and powerful weapons might not have any at all, but still this is a great feature which has unfortunately been completely ignored in the modern FPS.Last but not least, your nanosuit is essentially what makes you an unstoppable soldier. There's armor mode to reduce damage taken and stealth mode which makes you invisible and allows for a more stealthy approach. The modes are mutually exclusive which makes sense and use energy. Furthermore you can upgrade your suit as well with different enhancements which can also be done on the spot as well! Improve your armor absorb, make you stealthier, decrease the energy drain etc. Admittedly there around 15 to choose from but they are there and they can define the way you play through missions.For completionists, there are several collectibles scattered around the different levels which include: emails to expand on the lore, collectible dog tags, collectible car keys and souvenirs from New York.The level design is magnificent. The city of New York looks wonderful,   even after the Ceph invasion and destruction, the map progress allows for a semi-linear if you will completion of objectives. Don't think that this is not a linear game. It totally is, however there's a degree of freedom in which you can complete some of these objectives. You can avoid enemies if you will, flank them, use vehicles, detach turrets from barricades etc. The gameplay is absolutely great, never a dull moment and it keeps you on your toes constantly.Now for me of course, since I'm a sucker for 90s/early2000s blockbusters (The Rock, Independence Day, Armaggedon, Crimson Tide, Black Hawk Down) the story is pop-corn entertaining fun. The dialogue is as good as it gets, you get your epic speeches, your betrayals, your arrogant villains, basically all the tropes you'd expect in a movie. And you know what? It ♥♥♥♥ing works. It works so well in the concept of the game and it fits perfectly. And I cannot stress enough that all of this would otherwise seem silly if it wasn't for the exquisite soundtrack by no other that the master himself, Hans Zimmer. Hanz Zimmer is one of my favourite music composers and he's also the primary reason why I fell in love with the Single Player campaign of Modern Warfare 2. The soundtrack is epic and it intertwines with the gameplay, superb dialogue and the game itself in such a way that I think that any other soundtrack would have seriously affected the way I felt after I finished Crysis 2.Now the negatives which definitely exist but by no means take away the joy of the game. The enemy is AI is a little bit weird, don't expect smart enemies who will try to do everything in their power to kill you. Even at max difficulty, they behave is a rudimentary way. They hide behind cover, they fire, sometimes they might throw a grenade or two and they will try and move towards you. Nothing fancy and a bit on the silly side at occasions especially whenever stealth is involved. The models look a bit dated as I mentioned above and lip-syncing might be non-existant at moments. Notable example is the soldier talking to you while wearing a surgical mask, really shows that the developers didn't want to bother with lip-syncing and facial animations with the exception of some key characters. Most of the dialogue is transmitted to you via voiceover in the suitcomms however said dialogue I believe is vey well written  for the context that the game is based on.I'm not saying that this is the best dialogue in the history of gaming, but for the cheesy action packed game Crysis 2 is, the voice acting and the dialogue is brilliant.Lastly the game is a bit short, not as short as such of the 4-6 hours of modern FPS single player campaigns (I estimate around 8-10 hours if you also want to get all collectibles), there's very few Quick Time Events but there are there, cutscenes while great tend to border on the unnessecary at times but overall Crysis 2 is a one of the greater games of genre and you should have the pleasure of playing it. I got this at less than 5 euros during a sale and I think it was a steal compared with the entertainment I got out of it.tl;dr: Crysis 2 is a brilliant FPS and you should definitely have the pleasure of enjoying it yourself, strongly recommended, a true classic.

Based on the earlier titles in the Cry series I expected huge open maps, but instead this is a CoD-like completely linear campaign. An other thing I didn't expect is that this is more of a stealth-backstab game rather than a shooter. The regular Ceph aliens are bullet sponges, and their heavy units are rocket sponges, so it's much more convenient to sneak up to them and knife them from behind. I really liked that it's possible to sneak around almost all of the human enemies without killing them.The over the top heroics in the intro, and the really annoying, superfluous and unskippable tutorials at the beginning almost made me drop this game, but eventually it turned out to be quite enjoyable. The story was charmingly stupid, except for the ending, which was unsatisfyingly stupid. A little more QA would have been nice though, there are several graphical glitches, and at one point I could literally walk out of the level.			"

												Pros:Amazing graphics: Yes they are still better than Crysis 1Fast paced gunplay: With a healthy ammount of ammo and great level design, the challenge is not conserving ammo and rather quick movements and accuracy.You actually feel like a super soldier: Unlike in Crysis 1, you can quick sprint for more than 3 seconds, cloaking is actually useful, armor is actually useful and drains your energy so you're not using it for 99% of the game, and you dont have to switch modes just to jump slightly higher or pick up an enemy.Realism: When you look down, you can see your legs so there's that.Better enemies: No name-calling Koreans like in Crysis 1 to soak up bullets and hurt your feelings with their insults.Great soundtrack: Music is gud.Cons:Story: Not the best but hey it's a video game.Glitches: Some enemies like to run into walls repeatedly and some like throwing grenades at each other.Conclusion:If you like linear shooters, fast gameplay, or you just want to see your graphics card melt, pick up Crysis 2.9/10			"

												Crysis 2 is a first-person post-apocalyptic shooter developed by Crytek Studios and published by Electronic Arts. The game was released in March 2011. The story continues from Crysis 1 where the Ceph invaded the Lingshan Islands into them invading New York, USA. The player plays as Alcatraz, a member of Force Recon One, whose mission to infiltrate and capture Dr. Nathan Gould goes terribly wrong. This review will discuss the campaign and the dialogue, the gameplay and the features, performance and graphics, and the issues with the game. I did not test the multiplayer component as the online portion went offline in 2015. In addition, the Maximum Edition aspect of the game is irrelevant as all of the contents were related to multiplayer.Crysis 2 encompassed a good and logical storytelling campaign. The story expands on the Ceph invasion into America from the Lingshan Islands and the inevitable counter-attack by the Americans. Furthermore, the game provides great insight into the background of characters that carried before and through both games, notably Prophet and Jacob Hargreave. For instance, Prophet reveals that following Crysis 1, he found out it was not the last of the Ceph, rather the beginning of a new war. The story in the game made sense by the end of the campaign so I commend Crytek for elegantly telling the story. However, I do not like the massive logic gap from Crysis 1 to 2 because the sequel does not mention the aftermath of the cliff-hanger in Crysis 1 as the aftermath is explained through the Crysis comics series, which irritated me and I feel is an unwise business move. But, the dialogue in the campaign was excellent in telling the story. I completed the campaign in 10 hours and my favourite component was the team-based missions alongside the US Marines because many post-apocalyptic games result in a lonely protagonist. My second issue within the campaign was the lack of real excitement in cut scenes that clarified a major part of the overall story. For instance, when Jacob Hargreave reveals his knowledge about the Ceph, which I will not spoil, it comes across as another cut scene, not as a great storytelling moment, even if it was. Lastly, this game features some collecting aspects such as collecting dog tags on missions, collecting flashbacks, and so forth. It's not overly filler but it's not overly interesting to invest the extra time into finding the extras. Overall, the campaign is good because the story within the game, not the overall story is told with depth and precision and has minimal loopholes. The main issue of having to follow the comic series to determine what happened in the cliff-hanger from Crysis 1 does hurt my overall experience of the campaign.Crysis 2 possesses a variety of gameplay features to mostly improve the game. First, the game features a levelling system in which Alcatraz can kill the Ceph and garner Nano Catalyst points to upgrade his nanosuit. There are four different tiers with three upgrades in each, which is separated into tactical, armour, power, and stealth module tiers. This is a decent system because it allows you to improve Alcatraz's overall combat effectiveness and it has a nice balance to not overpower him but improve him because as the campaign progresses so does the difficulty of the Ceph. My major annoyance with this system was the lack of clarification if an ability is active or not once you purchase it. For instance, if I buy threat tracker, the game does not mention whether its active. The second gameplay feature is the layout of missions in the campaign. I really like the layout of the missions because despite the game being linear, you can approach a mission in a variety of ways. For instance, when Alcatraz opens his visor, he can see his tactical options for the mission, which may be going 100 metres to the right through stealth to complete the mission or going forward 30 metres and grenade the enemy. Furthermore, the weapon customisation system expands on the variety of approaches in a mission because Alcatraz can alter his gun depending on what approach he wants to take, ie. Stealth approach and a silencer. This freshens the gameplay and missions because Alcatraz has various options in completing a mission and can suit his equipment towards that approach. Lastly, the weapon combat, melee system, and vehicle movement and combat are all smooth, fluid and enjoyable. Vehicular combat does spice up the game, particularly on long distance missions. Overall, I commend the gameplay and the variety of features because it all does enhance the game experience.Crysis 2 has very consistent performance and beautiful graphics. This game reinforces why Crytek were the leaders in gorgeous games because this 2011 game is truly a stunning game. The graphics are superb, from the destruction that affects the landscape to the realism of characters to the overall tone of the post-apocalyptic atmosphere. Furthermore, I like the simplicity of the UI, which is the main menu. The performance as mentioned, is very consistent. On my mid-tier system, which specs are highlighted on my profile page, I played on very high settings and drew a constant 35-50 fps. When there were FPS drops throughout a mission, there was no stuttering, making performance steady throughout a mission. However, at the beginning of the majority of missions there would be a major freeze probably due to a massive fps drop for some unknown reason. Loading times varied in the game. Some missions took longer to load than others, which was annoying on some levels but not a major nuisance. Overall, the only hitch in performance was the start of the mission stuttering, but for the most part this was a smooth game. Likewise, the graphics was top-notch.Despite most of the review containing positives and some containing negatives, this game had a ton of bugs and glitches. I encountered six bugs and/or glitches that occurred frequently throughout the campaign. For instance, the worst was the sound engine dying, resulting in me restarting my computer. The second worst annoying bug was dialogue showing up on the screen as I had subtitles enabled and the characters that were meant to say those lines went silent, pointing to more issues likely with the sound engine. And the other bugs and glitches was mainly relating to dialogue, event sequences and gameplay. All in all, the issues did hurt the game for me.Overall, Crysis 2 is a good game that features a logical and competent campaign, great gameplay and features, a beautiful atmosphere and environment and consistent performance for the most part. This game had a deep and logical story that explained the specifics and the broader picture. It provided fluid combat and various approaches to tackling missions, freshening the linear aspect of the game. The main issues was the logic gap from Crysis 1 to Crysis 2 due to the business idea that the story should be advanced through Crysis Comic series and the amount of bugs and glitches infested into it. This game is $29.99 and you can get up to 18 hours in my opinion on the game fitting in the campaign and the extras. At $29.99, I recommend getting this on sale. However, if you are completely new to the series, I recommend getting the Crysis Collection at full price of $44.99 because there is three different games that tell a massive story and all of which have been well received.Ratings:I calculate the point system by rating each component I discuss and then averaging the total and deducting marks depending on the amount and severity of issues within the game.Campaign: 8/10Gameplay: 9/10Graphics and Performance: 9.5/10Overall: 7.75/10Thanks for reading my review!

												Coming from the original Crysis, I actually disliked the opening to this game a lot. However after sticking with the game, it grew on me and I have to say I probably prefer Crysis 2 to the original for afew things:- Story: Much better than the original and is expanded on in Crysis 2. We learn more about the Ceph and have more encounters with them over the original game and many more Ceph variant enemies to fight. - Fluid Controls: The controls are much more user friendly than the original. Yes you can remap but the way the suit handles far better in this game. - Graphics: Improved and the game is still beautiful in 2017. The game has some stunning scenes and based in NYC,- Gunplay: A larger variety of weapons and most feel unique and handle in their own way. What I disliked:- Linear: The game is very linear compared to the original. Much more on-rails shooter. I can only assume this was a design choice since Crysis 2 was 'consilized'.- Some 30fps animations: I noticed some animations in the game seem to be locked to 30fps. Firing/Reloading with certain weapons such as the Shotgun has noticeable judder and can be distracting. - Game mainly takes place in NYC and some levels/map design don't do a good job in making the feel of each level unique. Can get slightly repetitive at times. I would recommend a playthrough of Crysis 2 for Crysis fans and whilst Crysis 2 does improve on some fronts for the franchise, I still think the original Crysis series remain more true to core gameplay and map design, so newcommers make sure to not miss out on the original! 7/10			"

												It's late 2016, putting this game at up to 5 years old, and it still shines. Before I go too far, read the last paragraph on the complaints of linearity.Crytek have an amazing grasp of engine technology, juicing more visual prowess, AI and performance from a PC than many other games on the market, and it helps drive an amazing game.The setting is a well-realised New York City in the near future, with an alien attack ongoing, and several parties trying to vie for power to eliminate this threat and the various enemies in their own agendas. The story is excellent, and well acted (personally, this is my favourite SC/shooter/Super suit game - Sorry HL2), visually stunning (although a few updates now would truly put it back atop - it still is beautiful though, surprisingly so) through great texturing and lighting, and wonderful set pieces (Times Square in the soaking rain has a boss battle which oozes atmosphere, and the final level is a breathtaking idea, I won't ruin it), excellent sound (atmospheric, and great voice work), and liquid performance and controls to run it.This game jumps from £6 to £12 (figure out your own currency, folks), and it's very much worth it at either price - a much treasured gem in your collection.Now many people call this game ""linear"", compared to the first game. Honestly, you do run through streets, which feel like gauntlets, but every location has a number of options for stealth, attack and supply routes through (using your visor to plan & scan), the only real difference is that you can't wander off AS FAR. The first game was just as linear, it just had ""wider"" areas to explore, but still required you to end up at the same space to perform the same actions, from within the same level. So yeah, it may feel enclosed, but the only difference is a little less space to mess around with.I highly recommend this game. Crytek make (or did) make fantastic stuff, and this is one of the best.But can your PC run it? There's fun in the question before you even select ""campaign"".Oh finally, you may want to read up a little on the events of the first game if you never played. Some self-referencing from the start throughout can leave you questioning things.			"

-Quick Review-Crysis 2 is an Action FPS with various degrees of stealth and environmental combat. Crysis 2 Maximum Edition was developed by Crytek Studios and Published by EA, Crysis 2 was released in 2011.Disclaimer: Multiplayer is gone, so that whole aspect of the “Maximum Edition” just went down the drain.Reference: http://www.pcgamer.com/crysis-and-crysis-2-pc-multiplayer-will-shutdown-with-gamespy/-Detailed breakdown review-Story: You are the Marine “Alcatraz”, Alcatraz inherits the Nanosuit 2.0 from it's previous owner whom calls himself “Prophet”, and now everyone in the game will call you prophet for half of the game.(This greatly annoyed me... to the degree that after an NPC exclaimed, “It's Prophet! Kill him!” I would promptly turn around and pummel him to death with my rifle stock.)The story itself is a little bit tough to follow if you've not played the first game (like I haven't), but having a large repertoire of sci-fi media background I easily caught on to what was being discussed within the game. The story is about as interesting as you can expect from a FPS from 2011 (in my personal opinion that's nothing to be proud of).I've also felt that architectural cues are being lost on me, you play through the destroyed streets of New York City. I have been to NYC once, but I felt like a lot of the geometry in the game was referencing the city, but was ultimately lost on me since I'm not very familiar with NYC.

Gameplay: The gameplay was the most enjoyable feature to Crysis 2; the Nanosuit 2.0 has a variety of upgrades which can be purchased after you kill and collect samples from the extraterrestrial aliens.There are several ability enhancing traits the Nanosuit 2.0 offers: Sprint, Jump, Armor, Stealth, and Nano-vison. All of these abilities require suit energy, so there is a limited amount of time you can use these abilities, using multiple abilities drains energy even faster.

Achievements: There are no Steam achievements for Crysis 2. There were achievements for the Xbox version of the game, so someday there might be an update with achievements, but at this time there are none.

Price: Crysis 2 – Maximum Edition is priced at $29.99. Unfortunately “Maximum Edition” is a fancy way of saying “here, download extra junk you can't use, because there isn't multiplayer anymore”.Buy the game when it's on sale, the game itself should be priced lower for the content and the amount of time it will take to play through the game. One play through will take approximately 6-9 hours, depending on the difficulty and how “completionist” you are.Conclusion: All in all, Crysis 2 was a good game. Mediocre sci-fi story. Entertaining and rather flexible gameplay. No steam achievements at this time. Over priced, wait for a steam sale or bundle deal.I recommend this game to people who enjoy FPS, but unfortunately this fall into my “play and forget” game categories, so ultimately it doesn't have any niche that sets it apart from other generic story-driven FPS's out there.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update September 26, 2015:Spellchecking, thank you Angfucious.

												So here's my review for Crysis 2 :)Pros:+ Nanosuit is something fresh and unique + Dynamic and engaging gameplay. Customization option for both nano-suit and weaponry in order to complement player's game style+ Excellent campaign. I enjoyed mostly of campaign missions. + Great storyline+ Good graphics. CryEngine shows it's power and stunning visuals.+ Perfect soundtrack+ Fun multiplayerCons:- Lack of fractions- Not enough space for player, missions are pretty linear. - awkward AI- Technical glitches- Alomost no destruction, player have not enough interact with game world- Not well designed small multiplayer maps. To sum up, Crysis 2 have enjoyable singleplayer, even worth re-playing actualy. Multiplayer is something fun, but not enjoyable enough. Game have lack of open world, differently from it's sequel.

												Not usually a huge fan of FPS games, I can say I really enjoyed playing Crysis 2, the visuals are superb, the story is prety decent but doesn't get in the way, the controls are easy to work with and the normal difficulty is forgiving enough to a fairly poor player such as myself.The good:- graphics on ultra are first rate, loads of detail in the playable area and plenty to admire in the background.- there are many different approaches to almost all scenarios, take it all quite stealthy or wade in guns blazing.- length of game is fine, and there is plenty of side stuff you can busy yourself with.- plemty of checkpoints, so dying isn't too much of a painThe not so good (but dont be too put off)- I'd have liked a larger range of weapons.I didn't attempt to play the multiplayer, and the game supports 21:9 monitors natively.

It was back in the day a total new expierence for gamers like me. I really enjoyed Crytek's game and the Cryengine. Still one of the best engine's imo.Dont buy this game for the multiplayer. The multiplayer is dead. Just buy it for the single player and you will be rewarded to play this super game!			"

												Has definitely taken a step back from the original in all aspects. But then, it doesn't really feel like a Crysis-game. The nanosuit has been copied and they've made a terrible and flawed game based on it's use. The game may render faster on old hardware than the original Crysis, but it's only thanks to worse quality and less complexity. I just don't understand how people can find this ""unique"", ""engaging"", ""wonderful storyline"" - it's just the opposite. And if not dumbed down any more for consoles, save system is check-point-only - so forget openness.			"

												A visual treat of a follow-up to Crysis, the sequel completely changes direction and almost suffers from it, if not for its otherwise excellent game-play. Whilst Crysis and Warhead did very little truly interesting in the narrative department (with Warhead at least trying to do something about addressing that) the sequel quickly puts you into an entirely new environment and situation with very little explanation into a world that is a mess. Being ferried from one set-piece to the next on a strictly linear and far narrower path, I quickly realised that I was losing focus on what was going on with a conflict that seemed to spring out of nowhere and whilst there are obviously connections to the original, they seem tenuous at best. Crysis 2's narrative is a mess and whilst Crysis got away with its minimalist approach as it didn't shove it right up your face, it's hard to ignore the silliness going on in 2 as it, unfortunately, does shove it in your face.The plus of all of this is that the core game is still very fun, if not severely reduced in scope and potential variation. Replacing open objectives are checkpoints along a trail that mostly replaces the how you approach an encounter with where you approach it from; the game does at least provide different routes for you to approach fights from that can give eager travellers an upper hand. This is particularly important given that the nature of your enemies have changed and whilst you're still fighting a lot of humans, you also have various alien enemies to take out, from foot soldier equivalents to large walking annoying bosses. The removal of island openness does at least make way for some truly fun set-pieces though as the further you get into the game, the more interesting they become culminating in an extremely fun final level. As memorable as some of them may be though, there is an inherent reduction in the replayability in the game; you can only approach encounters in so many ways, set-pieces are only unique the first time and weapon variation (both in what's available and how many you can carry) limit the empowering craziness of the original and Warhead. Ultimately, 2 feels very much like an extension of the ideas in Warhead, but at double the length and losing what made Warhead a fun in-between point of Crysis' openness and general FPS linearity. By the end of this game though, whilst I had felt satisfied, I was in no rush to play it again, nor even consider how I would attempt to go back to that particular set-piece and try completing it in a different manner. Essentially, there's one good run here before the game feels like it has expired.Whilst Crysis 2 does look fantastic and has a great sound-track to boot, it lacks much of the uniqueness that its predecessors had whilst only providing minor boosts to the things that already made it a great shooter. Fun overall, but a greatly reduced experience overall.Multiplayer: There's a greater push for the MP component in 2, but it essentially plays out like many small map-based shooters. A few interesting quirks here and there, particularly in your suit-enabled movement, but otherwise an extended feeling from the main game, that of competency and not much else.			"

												Crysis 2 often isn't considered as good as its predecessor by many fans of the franchise. While it's true that the maps have gotten smaller and more linear, Crysis 2 has a lot less technical issues and makes a good job at presenting and advancing the plot line.+ Atmospheric intro video and loading screen videos+ Great soundtrack+ Stealth killing with a knife from behind is introduced to the franchise+ It looks great and runs well+ New York is neatly done and has many details- Too many alien enemies who aren't that fun to fight against as humans- While using cloak mode, enemies seem to ""randomly"" walk into the right direction towards you although they shouldn't know where you are.- Sadly, the game mechanics are a bit dumbed down because it's a console port: 1. you can't save manually anymore 2. you can't destroy the environment as much anymore. 3. nanosuit powers like maximum speed and strength are removed. 4. much more linear gameplay than before- Ending felt a bit weakI would recommend buying this game since I had fun playing it. But if you are still interested in playing this game, you should download a mod that integrates the quicksaving function.Replay value: AverageRating: 7,5/10Recommendation: Yes			"

												Although you can certainly test your computer's capabilites by running this FPS on ultra high settings, it still looks great even if your computer is a bit older, like mine :)Its a sci-fi story with mostly conventional weapons. The combat is satisfying, and you need to think your way out of tricky spots more often than expected.I found the playtime to be on the average side (20-30 hours), but I did have a lot of fun in that time.It should be a good game to try for under 10 bucks at this point.I give it an 8/10 and am only really knocking it for the relativly stright forward story and play time.Have fun!

												No...sometimes I try to go back to this shooter that now can be played in a wonderful steady 60fps ultrawide 1080p....but no, the game is just extremely boring past the first two levels. In a way it feels like crysis: the suit works, the weapons are customizable and all and gunfights are challenging. There is a very sad lack of scenery though. The whole map and scenery is completely soul-less, plain, boring, without any art at all. If in the first crysis it was wonderful to go around the enemies, surprise them, explore the forest and take a sea route, here you are confined to some urban streets, very few open small buildings (where you can even notice the copy-paste of the props), even the horizon looks closer than it should and everything feels confined, while in the original Crysis it was amazing to feel the first island (and the other levels) and the possibilities that it offered. Of course it was no Oblivion or Skyrim but it was still something much more interesting than this call-of-duty-styled sequel. It just doesn't fit it well :(			"

												2-sentence review for the solo game : if you play 2 FPS games per year (or more), Crysis 2 will bring nothing new nor memorable to the table. It is however still a decent entertainment with a few perks, despite a lot of downsides.Pro:- alien invasion gets some nice magnitude near the end of the game- the combat suit & its powers are relatively nice to play with- a few enemies are really hard and it gives a few intense fights, especially when they pair near the end of the game !- solo campaign is not too short, something like 10-15 hours if you don't speed-run all the wayCons:- rhythm is very scattered because we have to pause to regain health & power every 30 seconds- stealth is OP & too easy- spam-hitting enemies with our rifle butt is OP- often alien enemies could easily kill us from a distance, but they always feel the urge to rush to us without firing to get spam-hit in the face with our rifle butt (and it's OP ;-) )- where is the final boss ? The final battle ? Hello ? Anything ? Anyone there ?- globally too easy, with only a few hard passes- no munition management : there are just munition boxes everywhere ; there are at least 2 or 3 times more munitions than an average player needs to kill all the enemies- you have to rush to get essence out of the killed aliens before it disappears ; in normal combat, it's already painful, but if you want to be a snipper, it means you'll never get the essence, and thus you won't be able to get the enhancements based on them- story isn't even worth a B-Movie (oh, 1 of the guy giving us orders by radio will actually betray us, what a surprise ! ;-) )- you can't shoot ill ""zombied"" people, even not gib them if they're already dead ; this gives an awful Disney World ride feeling... >_<- nearly game breaking bug : a bit after half of the game, you're supposed to take down a big alien ship ; except it doesn't spawn ; the soldiers firing around don't spawn either, so there are guns firing with no one holding them, which is rather funny. Fortunately, if the boss doesn't spawn, you can just power jump up on the side and walk a bit till you reach a tunnel which is the end of the level, and it'll load the next one			"

												God dammit. God, ♥♥♥♥ing, dammit. You had it, you guys were so close. A great story, great mechanics, an open-world freestyle approach. It was all there, in the palm of your money-grabbing hands. But you ♥♥♥♥ING threw it out the window. What does this game offer me now? WHAT?!? Characters I could give less ♥♥♥♥♥ about? A few Alien mob types and the same scenario for every engagement because of the linear path? How about those enhanced graphics, huh? Oh wait, what about all those explosions and cut scenes!?Yea no, I'll just go watch a Michael Bay movie.For two years of waiting (TWO YEARS, let that sink in) you get the ability to upgrade your armor to an almost mind-numbingly un-customizable degree. And it doesn't even matter what play style you were going for because you might as well be elevated to level of God by the end of the game; you'll have every damn perk that has existed and ever will exist. Walk into the middle of a fight and just sit there as the enemy mobs♥♥♥♥♥♥their pants at the sheer might of this ♥♥♥♥ing suit that can take your crap and turn it into gold. Where is the skill you need? Where is the approach? It's gone.New York City! Awesome I can't wait to run around street to street saving the day bashing Alien heads in! Naive. So naive. I can't continue this review anymore, it's just too depressing.So pick up a copy today, I guess, if you like killing Aliens or play Call of Battlefield 16: Let's Kill Middle Eastern People and need a change of scenery.

												Crysis 2 has it's flaws but it was the most epic and enjoyable single player first person shooter I've played since half life 2. The escalation of intensity as the game progressed and the ability to improvise your way through almost every encounter really sold it for me. However it's a game you have to play along with to appreciate. If you sneak by everything or go guns blazing and don't explore all your tactical options, it won't have the same impact. Also play on Supersoldier difficulty 9.5/10!			"

												Damn I love this game.Some will argue that this game is a shadow to what Crysis originally was, however this game was a different approach to the franchise and was not meant to be like Crysis 1. Instead of having that semi-linear ""open world"" gameplay C1 and CW had, it's a linear campaign. But it's not like Call of Duty in the sense that you're just in a small corridor for the entire game, in Crysis 2 you're in one of the world's largest cities- NYC. You can go into many shops, houses, hotels, and like Crysis 1 you can hide in bushes and shadows. Using that Crysis style of gameplay, you can get through enemies however you want- You can cloak through them, run and gun with armor, or just spam grenades or run away entirely. The main villains of the game, the CELL corporation and the Ceph are a bit less intimidating than the enemies you faced last time around, but they aren't stupid either. CELL will have enemies that rush you in numbers while the Ceph has giant robots, sumo wrestler aliens, and extremely powerful gunships. The story is so much more in depth and detailed than it was in the first game. Not to bash the first game, but all it was is ""the KPA is hiding something Annnnd it's aliens"" but this time around the characters are much more memorable (I really only enjoyed Psycho in the first game). It is ridiculous that Alcatraz, the guy you play as NEVER TALKS and if he could talk CELL would have never been hostile to him. You'd have to play the game to understand what I'm saying, but trust me you'll be thinking the same thing. But other than that, I found the story to be pretty good. The campaign itself is around 7-10 hours depending on difficulty, and it's 17 missions long (18 counting that the first mission is just a long cutscene).Multiplayer isn't even online anymore so I don't have much to say about it.Since multiplayer isn't a thing anymore, and I don't hear it was that much good to begin with, I'd say 19.99 isn't really worth it. I got this for 8 dollars so I think the price I paid for it was worth it.			"

												Many fear Crysis 2 to be the franchise’s turn from an open-ended objective-based shooter into a linear shooter that parrots the gameplay trends of all the other AAA shooters these days. For the most part it is, but that doesn’t stop it from being better than almost all those games. It’s very different from the original Crysis and Crysis Warhead, but Crysis 2’s level design still has a certain quality that’s rare these days.If you can find my user reviews of Crysis and Warhead, I described those games as possibly the last examples of sandbox-style mission design where you’re free to tackle objectives how you want in absolutely massive maps. Crysis 2 chucks that whole approach for something more similar to Call of Duty or better yet Halo. Crysis 2 has obvious chest-high walls for cover everywhere, quick-time events, a storyline about aliens and mercenaries that’s generic despite having been written by a published sci-fi author, upgrades bought with experience points, and generally gives players fewer options than its predecessors. It doesn’t however shove you down straight corridors, but maintains some semblance of the franchise’s open-ended nature.Where in the original Crysis players would get a full map of an area and multiple objectives at a time, Crysis 2 will display a single waypoint at a time at the other end of a medium-sized area with maybe three or four routes through it. You might see a sky bridge flanking around some enemies, a hole in a barricade, or a small tunnel underneath the area. And the game will directly tell you all this by highlighting weapons and routes on your tactical visor, assuming you’re used to more linear shooters.For what they’re worth Crysis 2’s levels are pretty well-designed. It’s still possible to sneak through most areas of the game and play the whole thing stealthily. When firefights do break out, instead of just popping in and out of cover you have a lot of room with which to employ some positional strategy on enemies. Effectively it’s like fighting in a Halo game’s combat arenas but with fewer vehicles.The nanosuit’s powers have been adjusted a bit from the earlier games but the same general strategies apply: use cloak to sneak by or flank enemies (prone is gone by the way), throw objects and leap around with strength, etc. The main change is that armor mode is no longer the default but must now be switched on manually, so you have to factor it in when managing the suit’s energy. Speed mode is pretty much just the sprint which automatically consumes suit energy. Strength is actually just a super jump and a melee attack.The aliens in Crysis 2 are simultaneously a bit more interesting to fight and more boring in how they work. In the earlier game Crytek tried to make them feel more “alien” by having them float around in the air with vague shield abilities, which could often make combat with them feel odd. In Crysis 2 they behave a lot more like humans as they walk on land, use what look like guns, and generally behave like your human enemies. Because they have different weak points and can sometimes disable your suit energy though, you still have to approach them differently. There’s one interesting new boss-type enemy that appears a few times throughout the game, and Crysis 2’s final combat sequence manages to be an unusually interesting and challenging fight.One area in which Crysis 2 is unquestionably an improvement over the original is its visuals and its strain on your hardware. The sequel both looks and runs better than the first game, especially in DirectX 11. I guess being released on consoles meant Crytek had to actually optimize the game this time. Crysis 2’s use of lighting, post-processing, bokeh depth of field, and tessellation put it above all but a handful of games released since 2011 in terms of tech. It’s probably one of the earliest games to reach the threshold we’re seeing on PS4 and Xbox One now.On my i5 and GTX 760, on maximum DX11 settings in 1080p the game runs at 60 frames per second almost all the time, occasionally dipping down to 50, and never going below 40. However, like its predecessors Crysis 2 does suffer the problem of locking to 24Hz when played in fullscreen on a TV. Forcing a borderless windowed mode with external software can fix this.To compare, in my earlier reviews I called Crysis and Warhead simulations of 80’s action movie tropes where you can manipulate the mechanics of Predator and First Blood Part II however you want. Instead of a simulation, Crysis 2 feels like a game -- everything about its levels and mechanics has been transformed into a smaller set of rules Crytek wants you to follow, but within those rules it’s still one of the better games on the market.

												Crysis 2 is very different from the first 2 games. They've changed gameplay so much. You don't choose nanosuit modes manually now except cloak and armor. I don't know if it's good or not but game is great anyway. I loved the gameplay mechanics, enviroment and detaching the mgs. Oh, you can also upgrade your nanosuit and it comes really handy in some situations. There were no collectibles or some extra thing in first 2 games but Crysis 2 includes collectibles and it's really fun if you ask me! Only bad thing about the game is story in my opinion but apart from that, game is great.			"

												Single Player Review:I will start with saying that this game has amazing visual , but not so great story line.As a person who never played Crysis 1 or ever looked for the storyline it was a bit hard to get in to the story line of the 2nd game.Every thing you do in the game makes you feel OP or like a ninja (you can use stealth and other).There are some few problems with the being damaged fast , but this is a good game.You can play the game in a stealthy way but you will never feel like a idiot for attacking , you can always go back to the stealth mode,Voices - 8/10GFX - 10/10Gameplay - 7/10Storyline - 5/10Score : 7.5This game is great if you like feel OverPowered but not forlong  (not being op all of the game , only part of it).There are some few bugs but this game is a very good game.NOTE : right now , this review is only about the single player , after playing the multi i will edit it.

												Well, where to start? This game is a great example of corperate greed. Yeah, that sounds about right.First off, the storyline is mediocre. I wish I could understand it, I really do, but to me this is like an epilogue to a poorly written spin-off of crysis. That isn't even the beginning.Gameplay...Basically, it's Call of Duty with a nanosuit. Gun play and other mechanics mostly found in multiplayer are extremely close to CoD style, Crysis was it's own game and didn't rely too much on other games for ideas. That has come to a close with Crysis 2. Oh, and I almost forgot that everything is much more linear in the campaign than the original one was aswell.Multiplayer, yet again it's CoD with a nanosuit. In Crysis 1 you had tanks, vtols, and helicopters, and you had a CS styled buy menu, everything was bought with points you earned. Now, it's default weapons with class loadouts and unlocking new weapons requires leveling up, sound familiar? Oh, not to mention killstreaks such as Radars and Radar jammers, air strikes, and a ton of other things. Oh, and Mesa, the biggest MP map in the original crysis, is probably bigger than all of the MP maps in this game combined.""But if it's so bad, why did you get it?"" It was part of the EA Humble Bundle, I didn't have to touch the keys for it but here I am, wanting to try and play SP again to see if I can make more sense out of it than I did when I first played and beat it. TL;DR: Don't get it if you're a huge fan of the first game in the series. If you love Cawadoody but you're looking for a little bit of change in your life, this will take the cake and your wallet.

												Crysis was a let down, but The Second Edition Crysis 2 Maximum Edition is Awesome. The graphics don't look at all like a Half-Life game. If you check out my screen shots and just look at the beautiful detail as mahyem starts,(and it does A BUNCH). I love the FPS games, and since they have beefed this up with a new graphics engine.You cannot go wrong getting this thing through the first week of October 2014, and you'd be nuts not to get it. I know,... there's no multi-player, but who cares? With a big arsenal of weapons to choose from, to the Suit you wear, to the sounds you hear( I use head phones): You are bathed in combat! I love this game it's smart and fun to play. Don't allow this to get by  you at this cost!			"

												W10 Defender: HOLY CRAP IT'S A VIRUS OH MY GOD NO NO NO NO BETTER CRASH THIS THING BEFORE EXPLAINING WHAT A FALSE POSITIVE IS. Yes, the game crashes because W10 thinks it's associated with a ""severe"" malware type. I don't believe Steam would have left it on the store if that were true. Just make sure to have the Crysis 2 folder under the Common folder (SteamApps) set as an exclusion to Windows Defender and you'll be fine. Also, because of this random crap, you'll probably have to change how your admin notifications appear. Since I don't mess with piracy, torrenting or what have you, I always set the notifications to OFF. They came back up, always asking me if I wanted to make changes to ANYTHING on my hard drive before opening up any sort of application. That was annoying...Jokes aside, not done with the game but it's pretty solid. Nice combat, tactical opportunities, great visuals. The downside is that the story is dull and the performance is kinda inconsistent. I'll get random screen stuttering and artifacting but it's only occasional. Also the game does NOT like an OC'd GPU so keep that in mind. I got rid of the bizarre artifacting by going back to my factory clock speeds (ZOTAC GTX 1060 AMP). My system is well within the recommended specs so, yeah, you tell me if 16 GB of RAM and an i5 4670k @ 4.2 GHz aren't enough.Meh. Whatever, it's fun but it's not perfect. 7.5/10 baby			"

												Sequel to Crysis, this game has excellent graphics - visually it's just gorgeous. The story is ok, nothing special IMHO.Unfortunately, unlike it's older brother, which was one of the first to bring full open-world playability, Crysis 2 takes you through a much more linear fixed path. You can't walk / swim / jump your way across the terrain with the freedom you had on the original game - and this was one of the game's major virtues in an era where most if not all FPS's would literally herd you through a fixed path. Although Crysis 2 is visually stunning and has a good gameplay, it feels more like a console FPS than the groundbreaking game that Crysis was when it was released. A shame, considering it's a sequel... Still, I played through it and had a good time, so still a thumbs up.			"

												Multiplayer has shut down because EA couldn't be bothered to find a new host after gamespy shut down. They don't even give the option of direct IP or lan.Not worth your money for the campaign. Crysis 3 campaign is better, & it's actually cheaper. If you buy Crysis 2, buy it for the multiplayer - oh wait, they don't have multiplayer anymore. So save yourself the money and don't buy it at all. ...There's a reason EA has been voted ""worst company in America"" multiple years in a row. They only got passed over in 2014 cause Time Warner Cable (my service provider) managed to be so ridiculously sh**ty that the voters were basically torn between voting for Heinrich Himmler & Adolf Hitler, & in the end the a**hole with the most name reckognition won the popular vote.

												I would have to describe this game as a ""Hot Stuck-up Chick You Went to School WIth"" They are very pretty and nice to look at, but the intelligence level is not quite great and may do some stupid things but make you feel as though your the dumb one. The enemy AI is some times ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and do not even notice when you pop one of there comrades heads like a water ballon who is standing just 25 feet from them. There aim how ever is quite good, but doesn't really cause a problem since your a walking terminator with Super Strength, Agility, can go invisible for a short amount of time and pretty much can with stand alot of fire power being thrown your way. But all in all it was still an enjoyable game to play and had me eye balling the screen like I just seen my friends hot mom come out of the bathroom in nothing but a towel. I recommend this if you are looking for a good looking action game with some time to kill, or just want to play something different on one of those rainy days.			"

												A step backwards from the original game in most aspects. Dumbed down suit features, gimmicky stats ups you have to unlock. This game really lacks charm or character instead opting for 'safe' boring gameplay. The only real achievements are that the game runs very smoothly and gameplay is mostly bugfree but is that something to merit sloshing through ~9 hours of goofy dialog and subpar storytelling? The gunplay is sluggish and almost all but two of the stats ups are useful. I could only recommend this if you got it for free or nearly free.			"

												Sadly, I was disappointed with this game, it has little to do with the original. Yeah, the suit and weapon customization is there, but it's basically COD with crysis paint over it. This is one of those games where ""consolization"" can ruin a once beloved game (same thing happened with Deus Ex Invisible War, except that game was terrible) into a casual-friendly, graphics blazing, linear focused game.How much equipment you can carry?In the original crysis, you can select fists, dual wield pistols, carry 2 two-handed weapons, an RPG, different types of grenades (Flash, Frag and Smoke) and C4 charges. Here, you can't select fists, you can carry only 2 weapons (includes pistols, which is CODesque), an RPG, Frag grenades and C4. Nothing else.Weapon customizationIn the original, rifles, shotgun, sniper rifle, smg, minigun and alien minigun can be equipped with laser sights which prove useful for the hardest difficulty, where there is no crosshair. Here, laser sight completely overrides how you handle the weapon. Worse, it's almost impossible to aim properly with it and did I mention it takes the scope/sights slot?What about sights and scopes? In the original, any two-handed weapon (minus the minigun and alien minigun) can be attached with any scope or leaving them scopless.Here, you can't attach a sniper scope onto a SCARAB, SCAR or an LMG (later in crysis 3, they added that functionality again from the original, but it's too late).What about fire modes? In the original, if you had a tactical attachment or a grenade launcher on your rifle, you can select any fire mode you want - from Full auto to Semi-auto to tactical attachment or grenade launcher.Here, any attachment you attach is going to replace the Semi-auto fire mode. How does that make sense? It's designed for consoles to qucikly switch between modes.Finally, the last part.The engine - CryEngine 3It's designed for both PC and Consoles, but you can clearly see that it's optimized for consoles. Not only that, but the engine itself is really buggy. You will see sometimes dumb A.I. enemies and partners that aid you in battle by simply standing and doing nothing, shooting at walls and sometimes they go in a t-pose or simply freeze. There is also a glitch where you can carry multiple weapons (i. e. a pistol, scarab, shotgun, sniper rifle etc. instead of 2 weapons), and also there are occasions where you have to reload the checkpoint or a level, because some levels can halt your progress if you don't play in a specific way.OverallOverall, the game is not good, but not bad either. It shows how the ""consolization"" process can ruin games by removing features, making the game sometimes linear focused so that the game works good on consoles and also simultaneously disappointing PC fans of the original. Sure, you can have fun with this game, but if you loved the original, keep in mind these things I mentioned, if these disappoint you, skip this game. But if you don't care about these problems, then I'd say give it a shot, but expect bugs and glitches. Most of them are patched, but the rest are still relevant. As for my personal recommendation, I say skip it.			"

												=| Disclaimer |=I have never played a Crysis game before nor do I have that much experience with storybased shooters on a regular basis. This also is a first impressions type of review that I shall update when I finished the game. I realise that the game is out for a few years now so the ""First Impressions"" wont matter all that much to you but I cannot just put out a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥review of a game I barely played, so instead I will write my first impressions down.=| Review |=After loading the game for the first time, it stopped loading and I had to restart the game. After a restart however it seemed like everything was fine and it loaded up right quick. With the usual logos popping up that got annoying in Metro already. That sidehit out of the way, no big problems after this occured. Saying this I should also mention that a few people seemed to have problem with the steam installation. Enough problems for another user to post a discussion on the matter that it would be easier to activate your key on origin and download it from there. That being said, the gameplay awaits.[Warning. The following content of the review may or may not contain spoilers. Read at your own risk.]As I hop into the game I am greeted with real life cutscenes and soon after the first intro part of the game. I am a Marine and I am supposed to save a grand man because he seems to be important to, I honestly have no Idea. I know that they talked about Aliens and that is all that was stuck in my head. That and the behavior of one member of the team acting like a total dumbass on a team of trained professionals. But instead of actually getting on land we are being attacked by an unknown force. Most likely Aliens as I assume. We have to get out and the usual intro mission stuff kicks in. Duck, Run, Hold this to open door and get out only to get the team shot and you being the sole survivor. And then I am greeted with a quite awesome cutscene with quite awesome music.But of course, getting shot by a alien Drone (?) also has its benefits. Because now a man in a cool looking armor scares the thing that attacked you away and carries you to safety. You wont get to know him for all that long because as soon as you wake up, you not only wear his armor but also see him dead on the floor. As you pick up his gun you are greeted with what will be your mission and information about the armor. The information is broad and not explained in detail as the game wants you to learn it in active combat, which I prefer greatly. It gives you little points in the game that dont break away from the immersion (due to the fact that the tutorials are portraied by the suits interface and AI) and gives you small tutorals on how to go into stealth mode, how to activate armor and how to use the suits visor. From there it is all you and how you play the game.And here we go towards the gameplay. Apart from the usual small tutorials the game runs very nicely. My PC not being the best gaming PC to be had I dont have a full on 60fps but I also dont know if that even is a thing for the game. For all I know, it could be capped at 30 as some games do. If so, please let me know in the comments so I may correct the review for that matter. Going through on scenario after another I finally reach a bigger street with a bunch of enemies all over the place. I thought that I would just die there and not get through it in one try. Seems like I thought wrong as it was easier than I thought. The enemies after all are not bulletsponges and grenades can make the journey through the city also a fairly enjoyable one at that. Sure you will scare off all the birds but if you see one of those alien cockroaches, I am sure that you are happy about that as the aliens will have to feast on human flesh instead of those birdies. Oh wait, its equaly bad. Well at least you saved one being for now.Getting through the first part of the campaign was rather easy to say the least. I am playing on Normal difficulty and find it still challenging enough. Now having entered the second part (just after loading) and getting to fight my first enemies in the new area I immediately died. And that is where I stopped to write this review.Now to a thing that happens to not only confuse me but also upset me. You know, optimisation is a huge issue when it goes to games of this scale. And I am not talking about games that just lag like hell. No, the game runs fairly smooth all things considered. But no matter if that is the case, the optimisation of the game could be better. You cannot fully adjust your sensitivity to one specific number but have to choose between 5-10-15 and so on up to 100. The cutscenes as well seem to have a higher sensitivity when looking around which can be a tad confusing as well. That aside the main controlls are also kind of not complete for that matter. Of course the game tells you what you have to use in combat, ingame but there is no way (or at least I couldnt find one) to remap those controlls. No option to remap stealth or armor function. And bloody hell can people stop putting crouch on C? Who uses C anyways? Jokes aside, that can still cause little issues while playing when you can barely pay any attention because everything looks god damn amazing and you are overwhelmed by it.The last thing I want to mention, which is a thing that annoyed me with GTAV as well. Graphical settings. The game (for me) turned on its lowest settings. That is just fine for me but there is a little problem there. Lowest, isnt ""lowest"". Lowest is ""high"". There are no options to choose Low graphical settings which seems to be a bit confusing for such grand titles. Because for GTAV, even if it says that you can run it on the lowest possible settings, that is about all you can do. Playing it is another thing that cannot be done for that matter. But of course this isnt GTAV (which still is a good game) and its playable no matter what. Its just that these are the things that I happen to find out while playing it for about an hour. And that is all.Thank you for reading.			"

												The game starts out decent enough where you can stealth and approach obstacles with different strategies, much like the first Crysis. With that said the stealth system is broken, where you can destealth behind a cement divider and a guy 100 meters away will just start shooting at you.However the game eventually turns into a horribly paced non-stop action filled shooter (that's not a compliment) where the only thing you can do is just shoot enemies and run to the next check point. Now this wouldn't be so bad but the gun play is awkward and the suit powers are pointless besides using stealth and armor if you are dumb enough to stand in direct fire.There is so much happening every second that you just stop caring about a building falling down or another alien ship crashing or defending your comrades from attack for the effing 100th time.The story is paced poorly as well and incredibly predictable. A large poriton of the campaign feels like pure filler. About 3/4 through the game the entire plot is frozen and you spend what seems like an enternity assisting the remaining marines in evacuating a dozen civilians and performing frustrating missions.I do not recommend as a Crysis fan I did not want a COD experience. I got maybe 5-6 hours out of this game before it turned into a shooter on rails. The first part of the game wasn't exactly 10/10 either.			"

												Of all the Crytek games I've played, this is probably the most polished and consistent. Fans of Far Cry and Crysis 1/Warhead will be disappointed by the more linear structure, but it still gives you a fair bit of freedom in combat. Doesn't hit the same heights of Crysis 1, but the alien bits actually work in this one so it doesn't hit the same lows, either. Overall, just a really solid shooter			"

												At first I thought I wouldn't like this game, but it surprised me. Crysis 2 offers a good gameplay experience, by mixing great graphics, nice cinematics and solid combat moments.Speaking about combat, they are the highest point of the game, as it lets the players decide their own style (rambo, stealth, sniper, etc). The technologies of the body armor creates unique experiences in the field.The game gets a little repetitive, so it not being much long is a good thing. It ends right where it should.7/10			"

												Terrible.I played it on ""Veteran"" thinking it would be a challenge.  It was not.  The only things that were challenging were that all enemies go directly to your position while in stealth mode (watched a NPC enemy ""skate"" sideways towards me) and stealth kills would only proc about 10% of the time, both of which rendered stealth mode completely useless.I was willing to finish the game, but then on the level ""Terminus"" right after I killed the ""Pinger"" there was supposed to be a APC crashing through to drive me out of there, but it never happened.  I restarted and loaded my autosave checkpoint (no real saves in this game) and I got the same bug.Uninstalled it immediately.Eat a bag of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥EA!			"

												It's a fine game. It's certainly pretty as hell. Just as pretty as the first and the third. Along with the graphical beauty, it's an excellently paced but utterly orthodox ""hide behind cover while your shield recharges"" shooter set within narrow corridors and occasional open areas.What brings me to not be able to recommend it is the checkpoint save system. This is the PC version, so I was hoping it would have a save whenever feature. Not only does it not have that, but huge gaps in between checkpoints. So many times I have fought tough battles and barely surviving, then falling off a cliff afterwards and then then having to redo the tough battle. This one facet was so frustrating that it brings me not being able to recommend it. "

												Crysis 2 is an okay shooter, but they changed the game in a direction I'm not a fan of.In the first game, you had the option to explore the island and had the ability to takedown enemies in multiple ways. However, in this game, you don't really have any much options. The combination of being very linear and being bland (linear doesn't mean its bad)  doesn't help that the environment in this game was dull that didn't offer anything special. There's a lot less destructables in the 2nd one compared to the 1st. The story was uninteresting and unmemorable.Overall, the campaign was very short and repetitive. I wouldn't recommend this game; instead try out the first one (or even crysis warhead). The graphics and the music in this game is pretty sweet though, but that's all the charm it has.			"

												The epic sequel to the Crysis Series, maximum edition is next to useless now as the multiplayer is dead but it was pretty good for when it first came out. The game has amazing graphics and a unique single player storyline game play. It is definitely one of the best games of it's year. Alot of pc's would've struggled to run it at the time. Bought this in Humble Bundle so i am very pleased with what i got. This game wouldn't be worth it's standard $30 because it's about 10 hours game play for the campaign. Although you can wait till it's on sale to buy it and it would definitely be worth the price. Super Suit, Super Soldier 7.5/10			"

												Very nice game and a must-buy during sales. The single player campaign offers hours of game time and a very good story. The graphics are amazing and so is the sound. Crysis 2 provided a good mix of stealth, full-on action, vehicular combat and differing environments. As I played Crysis 1, Crysis Warhead and Crysis 2 one after eachother, I found Crysis 1 to have the better gameplay due to the more open environment. Crysis 2 offers the best storyline and fun. The 'tactical options' do add some choice, but seems only a thin layer above the heavily scripted game progress.I also tried multiplayer for a dozen matches. Should always be some servers around to have some fun. The multiplayer uses a reward system to progress your capabilities which means you will take alot of beating when starting. Nothing too frustrating though, as I found the mp matches fun and fast paced.Overall, a highly recommended FPS!Score: 8/10Pro: + excellent graphics+ immersive story+ nanosuit capabilities+ decent multi-playerContra:- console-ish control system sometimes suffers- 'tactical options' only suggests open game world			"

												Great addition to the Crysis franchise. I should have played this much sooner but you know how it is, more games than time to play them I guess.The game takes place after the events of the first game and warhead. The story isn't anything amazing but it does a good enough job and is better then many other shooters I've played. The graphics are not on the same level as the original Crysis when it first came out in terms of advancment from other games at the time. However, they are still great and the game looks awesome. That is using the official Dx11 ultra upgrade that is built in to this edition. The suit powers you pick on the fly are Armor, Stealth, and power is is just automatic when needed so you can't just pick it anymore. There is also a suit upgrade system that you earn points for by killing the aliens. There are 4 categories and you can have 1 upgrade from each of the 4 active at a time. None really stood out as awesome or anything but they offer gameplay enhancements llike longer lasting stealth or armor, etc. I should mention that I never bothered playing Multiplayer as it is just something I'm not interested in, so I can't comment on how that is. Overall the game is worth what I paid for it for sure and I really enjoyed my playthrough. If it goes on sale and you are wanting to grab a good shooter, pick it up.			"

												Crysis provides both a unique and engaging premise for its campaign and top-notch graphics that once again raises the graphical benchmark for gaming. Well, kind of. It may not appear as instantly striking in terms of awesomness the original did with its lush, tropical setting but it's in the finer details and when things really escalate in the single player that will blow your mind. The sheer 'destructional' splendour of New York under alien siege has to be seen and played to behold. Seeing screenshots and a few gameplay trailers does not do it justice unless you're sitting there, at your desktop, plugged into your HDTV or whatever, with full surround-sound and maybe even 3D, escaping a sinking sub yourself. This being said, graphics don't make a game. And with such refined gameplay, it sure as hell doesn't make Crysis 2.			"

												I remain ambivalent towards first-person shooters in general, and Crysis really does nothing to change that.  However, the graphics on offer are just so much better than anything else on offer that it's a noteworthy game.  Even now, several years after release, this is probably THE game to use when you want to see just what a new rig or GPU will do.  With loads of brightly colored outdoor environments, the game fortunately eschews the repetitive, bland and drab palettes of competitors like Metro.  The crispness of the textures, depth of shading, and wide range of color gamut still have the power to bewitch sixty times a second.			"

The most generic sci-fi♥♥♥♥♥♥ever-They try so hard to make you care about the crappy story that control is frequently wrested away from your character, who gets incapacitated what seems like every other level to ""shake things up.""  I was okay with that the first time but it gets old FAST.-The character animations are awkward.  Body language accompanying dialogue is either nonexistent or super exaggerated.-Dumb AI-Disappointingly linear level design.  FFS it's NEW YORK CITY but they just had to cordon off the streets (with rubble, or fences that this super soldier can't jump over for some reason) so that you could only go in one direction.  There is very little open space.  Even navigating across the rooftops feels constrained.   Ugh.Just go play Halo or something.  This game is a disappointment.			"

												As you play through the Crysis 2, you could not throw out the idea that something is missing with the game. Nearly the first half of the game is dull and boring. These parts are like the game is throwing you some unrelated maps, where you either choose a stealth aproach or go for a direct assault. Hence you feel like you are playing some challenge maps rather than playing a campaign. Combining with the poor AI, technical issues like crashes to desktop many times and falling out of map, you are highly disappointed.Luckily, with the mission that you met a crew of soldiers, the game starts to rise, both in atmosphere, gameplay and story. From this moment on, it is kind of that you step into a complete different game, and that game has its moments. It is a shame that the developers force you to play a good portion of the game in a dull manner, after you see the second part.As a conclusion, I recommend the game. Besides it's great visuals and sound effects, Crysis 2 has the essence. It is sad that this essence is not fully used, if so, we would have another Half Life 2 at hand.7/10			"

												Transferring the system demanding open world FPS mechanics of Crysis to the consoles brought us Crysis 2 - a dumbed down, much more linear game, that plays like a blend of Crysis and COD/MOH/whatever other console FPS out there. It's not always a bad thing, as the funneling can lead to more intense/concentrated fights where you can't just dart off in any direction when you hurt your knee. And besides, there ARE some pretty open parts where it feels farily open worldish (almost).The audio and visuals are terricfic - especially the graphics. I played it in DX11 mode on ""Extreme"" (there's also a ""Ultra"" setting) as it seemed like a good framerate/eye candy compromise. The blend of scorched city, lush grass/trees and alien tech looks amazing. The campaign lasted me a little short of 9 hours, which I found appropriate in length, but the story itself is pretty generic alien invasion gibberish with an attempt at a plot twist when someone you thought was your ally was actually plotting against you (oh noes!).The only really bad thing here is the A.I. Sometimes it's just plain broken. Here are a couple of examples:I come up on a fight between soldiers and aliens, and decide to let them duke it out, and then kill the hopefully few suvivours. The last 2 NPC's standing is an alien and a soldier, who apparently found friendship while trying to kill eachother and just stood there 2 feet apart facing eachother - doing NOTHING. I put them out of their misery.Two aliens standing atop a container scouting for enemies (me). The guy nearest me apparently didn't have the keen eyesight of the one behind him, because he just stood there like a statue, while somehow managing to block the path of the alien behind him. Judging by his hyperactive movement he REALLY wanted to run towards me, and climing down the container to either side to circumvent his mime colleague was just not an option. After a giggle I vent into stealth mode and sneaked off.[SPOILER ALERT]The final fight with the 4 cloaked super aliens was just a (not funny) joke. They all more or less just got semi stuck in the terrain/invisible wall and figured the best thing to do was to insist on not shooting back, but instead trying to hide by turning on the cloak, which worked 0.02 seconds until my next bullet hit it. Jeez.[/spoiler alert]For the most part I really enjoyed the experience though - 80%.			"

												Crysis 2 continues in the steps from the first game but this time taking place in New York. Much is the same from the first one, but the graphics engine has been much improved and the suit abilities have been simplified making the switch from different powers very easy, as well as upgrades have been adding allowing the player to use upgrades tailored to their playstyle. Graphics wise my frame rates always held at 60 FPS and the visuals are stunning as ever. The campaign is pretty lengthy (took me over 8 hours to complete) and there are various weapons at your disposal; as well as each level has scattered collectibles to find which unlock extra e-mails or artwork from the main menu. The levels are all visually stunning and the gameplay is rock solid. If you're a fan of the first Crysis game or looking for a top notch FPS game Crysis 2 excels.			"

Crysis 2 have better gameplay mechanic compared to Crysis 1. In this game, you can use the Nano-suit various powers seamlessly without having to open the Suit Menu. This make the combat more fluid which is a good thing. But even the fluid action can't save the game from the boring story and characters. I got so bored playing the campaign that everytime I reach the end of a level, I kept hoping the next level would be the last. The multiplayer seems interesting, but the server was closed in 2014.

												Amazing.  I wasn't sure the Crysis 2 could match the glory that was Crysis.  I was sceptical about the city setting, being that the jungle made the fist one, but they've pulled it off and I was captured by a story that just got better and better.  The battles with the marines pulling back were awesome!			"

												A visual treat of a follow-up to Crysis, the sequel completely changes direction and almost suffers from it, if not for its otherwise excellent game-play. Whilst Crysis and Warhead did very little truly interesting in the narrative department (with Warhead at least trying to do something about addressing that) the sequel quickly puts you into an entirely new environment and situation with very little explanation into a world that is a mess. Being ferried from one set-piece to the next on a strictly linear and far narrower path, I quickly realised that I was losing focus on what was going on with a conflict that seemed to spring out of nowhere and whilst there are obviously connections to the original, they seem tenuous at best. Crysis 2's narrative is a mess and whilst Crysis got away with its minimalist approach as it didn't shove it right up your face, it's hard to ignore the silliness going on in 2 as it, unfortunately, does shove it in your face.The plus of all of this is that the core game is still very fun, if not severely reduced in scope and potential variation. Replacing open objectives are checkpoints along a trail that mostly replaces the how you approach an encounter with where you approach it from; the game does at least provide different routes for you to approach fights from that can give eager travellers an upper hand. This is particularly important given that the nature of your enemies have changed and whilst you're still fighting a lot of humans, you also have various alien enemies to take out, from foot soldier equivalents to large walking annoying bosses. The removal of island openness does at least make way for some truly fun set-pieces though as the further you get into the game, the more interesting they become culminating in an extremely fun final level. As memorable as some of them may be though, there is an inherent reduction in the replayability in the game; you can only approach encounters in so many ways, set-pieces are only unique the first time and weapon variation (both in what's available and how many you can carry) limit the empowering craziness of the original and Warhead. Ultimately, 2 feels very much like an extension of the ideas in Warhead, but at double the length and losing what made Warhead a fun in-between point of Crysis' openness and general FPS linearity. By the end of this game though, whilst I had felt satisfied, I was in no rush to play it again, nor even consider how I would attempt to go back to that particular set-piece and try completing it in a different manner. Essentially, there's one good run here before the game feels like it has expired.Whilst Crysis 2 does look fantastic and has a great sound-track to boot, it lacks much of the uniqueness that its predecessors had whilst only providing minor boosts to the things that already made it a great shooter. Fun overall, but a greatly reduced experience overall.Multiplayer: There's a greater push for the MP component in 2, but it essentially plays out like many small map-based shooters. A few interesting quirks here and there, particularly in your suit-enabled movement, but otherwise an extended feeling from the main game, that of competency and not much else.			"

												Good Graphics. Ok Gameplay in the first hour or so, but it gets really repetitive and boring. Soldiers and Aliens have pretty much the same AI, walking around doing bugger all and talking to each other ocasionally. Story is average at best, and with Crysis 3 it became just a Half-Life rip-off. Can't reccomend this game.			"

Crysis 2 is like Call of Duty.By that I mean: much more linear levels, less realistic-feeling guns and lots more unnecessary explosions.  Still a fantastic game, just not quite as good as the original.Oh, and if you're looking for the non-maximum edition, it's not here. EA pulled it from Steam because they're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.			"

												This is only a barely above average shooter with some above average graphics. Sure the graphic are great, if you only compare it to a console game. Games like The Hunter and Battlefield 3 that were designed with the PC in mind, blow this game out of the water in the graphics department. Truly a shame, as that was one of Crysis' most redeeming features. You can see the influence in other areas as well. Smaller maps, less players in multi player, cut prone feature. A lot of options ended up getting cut or just tossed due to balancing around the console versions. It isn't that this is a really terrible game, it’s just if you were expecting a sequel that took FPS to a level like the original did, you will be disappoint.			"

												A sequel-thing to Crysis 1 where you run around Manhattan killing aliens and a few humans who don't like your choice of clothing. The change in environment has made this game considerably more linear than the first one, and there feels like there is alot more intense violence. In short... it feels like a modern war shooter, though thankfully in this case the story is passable and the game builds up to the major fights rather than just being all explosions all the time. And at least this time the aliens are much less annoying to fight than they were in the first game, so that's a plus.Anyway, I'll go ahead and say ""yes"" to this, but I do so with little enthusiasm. It made some improvements on the first game but lost the more open gameplay. It's still fun, but like its predecessor I don't think i'll replay this one.♥♥♥♥ EA.			"

												Loved the intro!!  Guys at every corner! My only issue was running out of ammo.. haha..  I got the game on sale (maximum edition) and I love the graphics.  It's also cool, I must admit, to be able to kick a car over with my mega powers!  I started the game and was stuck in it for 3 hours! I think it's a keeper.Since I'm only 3 hours in (at my slow pace of lurking and such), I can't give a full review I suppose but I can tell you that up to this point it is awesome! I had trouble breaking my way away from it.  The abilities to increase armor and to go into stealth are awesome. You can melee in stealth if no one's around (silent kill) and I have to practice at throwing my grenades to where I get more damage per throw.  Lots for me to learn but yeah, it's awesome, I think! I took tons of screenshots if you want to check them out & I'd like to also recommend earbuds or headphones. I prefer ear buds.. It's easy to forget your surroundings if the lights are also down!Enjoy! And for the price I paid, I can honestly say I did not waste my money!!			"

												I actually really enjoy the game, have Crysis 2 also, you actually can not deauthorize the game on your PC. Have to jump through hoops and then EA gives you another serial key. Every single time I reinstall windows it uses up one activation. It was actually easier for me to just buy this when it was on sale for $5. With internet activation in general, why not just update the game itself.. This is more of a downvote on EA in general. What I'm saying is essentially I had to re-buy Crysis 2 to play it.

Also the game gets stupidly easy once you get a sniper rifle since the AI of the enemies is completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when it comes to your stealth. The redeeming factor is that you feel like a total beast doing it. Didn't give multiplayer a go. Doesn't seem worth it even to try. Overall if you like stealthing around shredding people's (and alien's) skulls open, it's a good game. Otherwise it's a pretty ordinary shooter.			"

												hey, do you like games that take everything that was good about the original and completelty remove it leaving you and a sequel completely unfamiliar? if so play crisis 2. Crisis has been reduced to what ammounts to a cod clone with the player devoid of all the special abilities and customazations that were available to him in the 1st installment. The sandbox, freedom of movement has been eliminated, and you are on basically a rail shooter linear path, there is little or no enemy diversity in this game you fight the same 5 enemies all game, the ai sucks, music score is a run of the mill orchestral which sounds so generic id rather listen to Lionel Richie, graphics take a huge step back, and this game is intollerably long and just drags on.pass this one up folks and get an fps with some substance, or if you havent played the 1st crysis, i suggest that and skip this digital turd.

												I was looking forward for a long time to get my hands on this game. When I finally did, I was a little disappointed. I really expected more from the gameplay, especially the AI.+ Graphics are amazing+ Physics are good for a FPS- AI is worse than expected. You are given the illusion of being able to finish missions in stealth, but that is utterly not true. I was hoping I choose my own way of playing this advanced game, but looks like it has to be a mess from start to end if you really want to finish it.I only recommend it for its graphics and maybe, MAYBE, story line. Otherwise, I only have 4 hours in record and I cannot see myself playing it again.Update Jul. 2015: I decided to play the game since it was sitting and staring at me in the library. I learned how to go through it in ""stealth"", but it is still extremely difficult not to go about shooting everybody. Cloak is useful, but it's just not enough. I updated the recommendation, because after all I DID enjoy the game and want to give the developers so much credit for the obvious hard work they put into it. Alcatraz is a badass!			"

												I've just finished the game at the hardest difficulty and AI was a complete disappointment, after Cevat Yerli's comments on it, ""the most sophisticated AI you'll ever see in a video game."" Sadly no, AI was a disaster. Cloak mode and armor mode of your nanosuit are your biggest helpers in the game, and with them, ""Post-Human Warrio"" difficulty was no match. Enemies and allies, all comporting strange... Crysis 3 will be an improvement on this I hope.Scenario: Well, the story was good honestly, being compared to most FPS. Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds and Arnold Schwarzannager's Predator are big inspirations for the writers of this game, definitely. The story takes place after 3 years of the Crysis 1 and Crysis Warhead. To be able to understand it completely, you have to pay full attention to the in-game dialogues and watch entire of the Prophet's Visions videos, which are available in unlockable section in main menu. Otherswise you'll be confused with big gaps on the fiction, therefore you may not like the story. It's like a puzzle. My only criticism here to Crytek might be the bad presentation of it. And if you don't like the science-fiction/aliens genre, this is not your game.Crytek also appointed a science-fiction writer to write a novel, thay may help studying the story in a wider perspective. Lastly, Crysis Wikia will be enough to ""veneer"" your knowledge of Crysis universe, especially the page of Jacob Hargreave.And even though the game imposes the usual alien invasion theme, Nanotechnology is an important research are in 21st century, so I kinda like it how they built the story of the nanosuit and its capabilities on it. A huge potential area to tell a story, via a game.Gameplay: My biggest concern on the gameplay was ""spawning enemies"". Yeah, when you're beating the game on the hardest difficulty, spend your 30 minutes to clear a part of the map with huge effort, and after all seeing spawning enemies out of nowhere is not a nice experiment.So FFS Crytek, drop spawning enemies from your future games.There's no savegame function, but that's okay. My only complaint about it is the long time periods between the checkpoints. Dying after a large progression can take you back to a so early portion, which can ruin your gaming and enthusiasm.Lastly, abouth the ""Nanosuit Improvement"" part... You can access this part by pressing H in-game. You're granted catalyst point by killing Cephs throughout the game, the with enough accumulation, you can buy some cools improvements. But some of these improvements are so pointless. For example, de-cloaking your invicible enemies... There were only 4 invicible enemies in the game, all of them were in the last mission, at the last part of it. Which took 1 minute for me to kill them all. Unlocking this feature took 16000 catalyst points, which was also the most expensive feature of all.What were you thinking Crytek? Have you released the game without being finished?  With the distributor being Electronic Arts, that's a high possibility. EA is known for putting stress on the developers to release unfinished products in a pushed calendar.Musics composed by Hans Zimmer, who's known for his works in movies like Batman Trilogy, Rain Man, Gladiator, vice versa. The Main Theme was perfect.Graphics are alreadly critically acclaimed.So 10 points for visuals, 10 points for sound effects and musical score.And my overall score for Crysis 2 is 8/10 with all pros and cons summed up.Post Script: I haven't tried the multiplayer experience, I'll give it a shot when Crysis 3 hits.Cheers, Can			"

												Despite a reluctance to admit that the sequel lives up to the breakthrough Crysis, I concede that it meets if not surpasses it in many ways. Dx11 features are definitley the selling point on tech improvements, tesselation being chief in that regard. Ace lighting and ambient effects, dynamic shadows and sunshafts galore. I love Crysis, and this is just more of the best fps game ever made. Das ist gut, hail Crytek game limit pushers.			"

												This game turned me into a sex-crazed, baby-making machine. You will not be able to turn the women down fast enough. When they tell you to throw a rubber on your jimmy and they hear you say ""Maximum Armour"" it's too late. They have already climaxed. You get down and dirty into it and whisper in her ear ""Maximum speed"", she knows the best is about to come.This game will not only make you a better gamer, it will make you a better lover, husband, and friend....I highly recommend this and the latter number 3.BROWNCOATS FOR LIFE!!

												Techincally the third installment in the Crysis line. Overhauled the entire way the game is played. New UI, smoother and by good prettier. Much more linear which from the original is a major drawback. Less weapons are avaliable as well with less tactical options for them. A more formidable enemy brings a new threat which is super exciting. Load times were quite a pain but granted it did not crash at all during play!			"

												      Ah, Crysis. An Instant classic in my book. Gamebreaking visuals of 2007 that even some of the best PCs found to be a bit of a challenge. Amazing visuals, stunning environments - particularly the alien space ship, and every level that was completely snowed out and frozen. Great alien concept, though apparently there were people ♥♥♥♥♥ing that they resembled War of the Worlds aliens too much (as if that really matters? It was a great enemy in-game).**** TL;DR at Bottom of this Review ****   I have great memories with Crysis 2 when I bought it on xbox360 the week it came out. Stunning visuals, Still a pretty good story.    While I recently purchased C2 on steam for nostalgia purposes (although it seems I am unable to use the crysis 2 login feature for multiplayer atm..), I must say that I still have my disappointments with the game.    I'm going to go head-on with what I consider to be the CONS of the game.    Unlike the original Crysis and Crysis Warhead, Crysis 2 (and 3) change up the overall HUD/viewpoint. Crysis 1 felt more realistic to me. In Crysis, your weapon was lowered and, visually, it looked further away from your head. In Crysis 2 and 3, your weapon feels like you are hugging it with your face 24/7.    I preferred how the weapon was positioned in the first installment. It felt more realistic to me, and therefore helped immerse me.    To add to that, while they still look killer, I much prefer the original look of the weapons in the first game. The Scar looks a little too futuristic in comparison to the original Crysis 1 scar which still looked futuristic (like an updated M8 Assault Rifle) while maintaining that solid modern look. The weapon designs in Crysis 1 and 2 do look great, but my preference, flat out, is the weapon design of Crysis 1.    Again, visually, I also dislike the changes they made with the nanosuit powers. The first Crysis had a ""Maximum Speed"" power, which was completely removed as a standalone feature, and instead, sprinting drains your energy. While this feature still works well for the game, I miss the overall individuality of Max Speed, and the other abilities. In addition, Crysis features a color changing effect when those abilities are activated.Using Max Strength empowered your nanosuit with a red glow, a glow that my eyes seriously enjoyed to look at. It just looked great.And using Max Speed surged your nanosuit with a vibrant yellowish glow that as described, surged through your suit. It looked astonishing even from the fiew parts of your body you could see in the first person view.Max Armor had no effect, and of course stealth made you stealth. These two maintained between both Crysis 1 and 2.    Visually the nanosuit looked better with abilities in use, and overall more realistic from my perspective. Whereas in Crysis 2 and 3, it seems almost like Alcatraz / Prophet is too buff. The muscles of the suit are almost exaggerated, and it just bugs me, the suit still looks iconic and great.    Previous statements involve cosmetic differences between the first and second game. However, my biggest complaint with Crysis 2 is the change in alien design.   Crysis 1 featured blue-lighted robotic aliens (with pilots inside) that flew around the sky with tentacles flailing about, as the aliens shot ice projectiles and ice beams. Their entire premise was freezing the environment while flying around. This was iconic and part of why Crysis 1 is and always will be in my mind a classic. Crysis 2 features red-colored robotic aliens with a premise of basically biological warfare instead of ice-age warfare. While the premise is just as, if not more effective story-wise for mass homicide, I cannot help but dislike this change. I much prefer Crysis 1's enemies to Crysis 2.    If you're still reading this, I give you a thumbs up.These CONS of course are personal CONS, and probably do not settle the same way with most other players as they do with me.That being said, despite my biases, I do love Crysis 2, because I am open-minded and won't hate a game just because it isn't quite what I prefer.That and the game still maintains a lot of traditional Crysis feel to it.The game feels great, and the multiplayer was a blast.I definitely recommend this game, but I INSIST that anyone who considers Crysis should purchase the first Crysis game first.TL;DR Buy Crysis 1 (If you already have played it then GREAT!) THEN play Crysis 2.			"

The fact that i found no glitches was amazing as well. If youre looking for a game with a mind blowing singleplayer this is the game for you! I rate the singleplayer a pure 10/10!The multiplayer wasn't the best. It has a minor setback than the first crysis (i didnt play it but saw some videos of it) first of all maps. Alot smaller. Second the multiplayer got way too fast paced. I like fast pace. And a big fan of slow pace. But this was a little too fast for me now this is personal opinion some might love it like this. But the fact is that multiplayer runs 20 frames per second while singleplayer runs 60. Now i do like the xp system and the dog tags and all. And the pure multiplayer mechanics so i give the multiplayer a 7.5/10My conclusion is that this game is definetly worth it for the singleplayer and if you like fast pace the multiplayer as well. This game must be the best game i played in the past couple of months. So go ahead and buy it!			"

												Crysis 1 but crushingly linear and less of a mile stone graphically (albiet more optmized thank fu ck). It does streamline the suit at least but there's an annoying upgrade system to rain on your parade, enemies no longer have impressive facial animations or interesting behavior when they aren't enaged in combat and the weapons are dull. The story is a lot better than the originals which was more of a ""what if Far Cry's story didn't suck"" take on that title. The low FOV is a pain in my♥♥♥♥♥and the game has downgraded the aliens while still making them really annoying. I'm mixed and the price is far too high.			"

												I was once again about 5 years late in getting to this game. I enjoyed the gameplay of Crysis, and the powers and tactics afforded by the Nanosuit are fun. As far as the Nanosuit goes, it all seems the same from Crysis. At the cost of limited (but regenerative) Energy, you can have Super Speed, Super Strength, Super Armor, or a Stealth Cloak. Fun stuff. What's really obviously changed is an attempt at a slightly more linear experience in the vein of the Call of Duty's and Battlefield's and so on. The first Crysis took place on a massive, open tropical island where you had objective locations but you had a lot of freedom in how to approach them.The areas in Crysis 2 are much more traditional, though they're by no means over restricted. Each major encounter area gives you the option of full frontal assaults, stealth, or some kind of special item/flank (a sniper rifle, turret, rocket, sniper nest, vehicle, etc). Back when I bought it, I paid $20 for it, and it took me around 10 hours to beat the Campaign. So while the value could have been a little better for me, I have to admit I enjoyed those 10 hours. Even at 5 years old, Crysis 2 is a graphical powerhouse, and I didn't get any grief for using modern resolutions (2560x1440). There's nothing here that really sets Crysis 2 apart from a multitude of other first person shooters out there, but if you want to feel like a powerful super soldier and you've exhausted your Halo games, I recommend picking this game up on the next sale. I'm sure it would only be $5 or less.			"

												Overall, great game but not as impressive as the first. There were several great set pieces. The story is pretty much garbage, but you don't play Crysis for the story. Graphics are fantastic - as expected.			"

												As probably everyone know, this one of the best looking games in the industry and I can confirm that's true. Detailed and awesome environments built for your entire journey in a nano suit. While I beat the game in the hardest difficulty ""Post Human Warrior"", the game is all about tactics; either you want to take everyone out the old fashion way or sneak in and take one-by-one, but keep in mind, is not as simple as it sounds because the AI change their tactics and is not as predictible as you may think. Once you get used to how the nano suit works, it will become easier and easier, to the point you will be able to think faster and given the situation act accordingly. I wont say anything about the plot of the game, because if better if you experience it by yourself; all I can say is I liked it. Multiplayer is crazy and I've still some practice to do. Overall, great, great game, really fun to play!...			"

												While it may not offer the same breath of freedom in approaching situations as it's predecessor but this is a solid game and the toned-down nanosuit still offers plenty of fun options.I don't want to dwell on what was lost from the first game. Instead I want to talk about what was improved. First of all a lot of the environments are more three dimensional that those in Crysis 1. While the first game had the super jump it mostly allowed you to just scale cliffs and get onto the roofs of the mostly flat buildings the game had. In Crysis 2 the urban setting allows levels to be more layered and verticality is much more important. For this it adds a ledge climbing mechanic that gives a much nicer feel to vertical navigation than in Crysis 1. The added slide move is also really fun to use in combination with a shotgun.To say the combat against aliens has been improved from the first game would be a colossal understatement. The alien designs from Crysis have been pretty much entirely thrown out and replaced with enemies that are actually fun to fight. The Ceph, as they are called now, fight in humanoid exosuits that make them seem familiarly human but while giving them a broad range of movement. They can climb, run along walls, squeeze through small spaces and are just generally very mobile. Their weapons are actually very inaccurate compared to human ones and they often resort to melee attacks.This allows you to fight them in a very different way to the human forces, who you must mostly engage from a distance and from cover like most modern shooters. With the Ceph you can dance. Use a shotgun or SMG or just your hands and attack them up close. Get in their face and move with them, after them and away from them. Explore the arenas you are in horizontally and vertically as you hunt after them. It's a style of play so different to how you face the human forces and the game's light RPG elements (alien forces drop pickups that give you XP) incentivise this up close and personal approach.The game offers a variety of environments and set pieces to engage in and many different guns, with the customization system from the first game still in place and unlike Crysis 1 the game remains fun up to and including the final level.

												Great game, but the story and the gameplay aren't nearly as good as the ones from the prequels.It's very linear, you only drive a car at one point in the campaign, the new aliens are just Halo-type grunts and it kinda lacks innovation. The story is really weird and it doesn't explain why there's suddenly a different kind of aliens or why the aliens are being called ""Ceph"". It also lacks a real showdown in the end, you just do what you always do and suddenly you see the outro.Multiplayer doesn't work anymore.It's one of the best first person shooters I've played but it's disappointing in comparison with Crysis 1 and Crysis Warhead.

												Crysis 2 exceeds in graphics, gameplay, optimization, audio design, music, etc. Even the story is pretty good, written by Richard K. Morgan, who wrote one of my favorites, Altered Carbon.Set five years after the first game where you first witness the Ceph in all their terror on Langshan, the Ceph have made their way to NYC, an urban jungle (as described by Crytek devs). I think the most remarkable thing about Crysis 2 might be the attention to detail with the recognizable buildings and showing their true height, just looking up at them in a video game shows how massive NYC can really feel from a virtual perspective. Obviously, it helps that the CryEngine is perhaps the best engine out there in terms of graphical prowess.I really liked the story, mainly because I'm a sucker for sci-fi games. So the various twists and military factions you encounter while trying to survive from the Ceph was nice. Granted, it's rather easy to survive from the Ceph is you use cover appropriately and kind of strategize your plan of attack. Or you can stealth your way around them, I did that a few times just to see what would happen; can't do that the whole game though as really, most of the Ceph you'll have to kill just to move forward.I didn't check out the multiplayer, but I bet it's pretty cool. And the way the game ended definitely set it up for Crysis 3, gonna play that soon.9.3/10			"

												Cautions: A bit buggy with some graphics cards (however their are usually some workarounds such as underclocking your gpu, etc.).  Multiplayer master servers have been taken down so nobody plays online anymore.  Not a lot to it, you can beat it in less than 15 hours if you're good at fps, or don't feel the need to slaughter everything that walks across your path.Pluses:This game is pretty.  It's Cryengine's showcase game so that's to be expected.  Still pretty by today's standards.This game has a lot of variety.  You have objectives, and obstacles that get in the way off those objectives.  Fortunately there's a lot of ways around those obstacles.  You can snipe them, cloak and then come up behind them and knife them, charge head on with an assault rifle, throw grenades, ignore them completely and run past them, find a tank and run them over, etc.  So that's fun.  Note: It is really hard to kill the armored brute aliens by punching them to death, I advice Jaw rockets from a safe distance.Modding available and encouraged by devs.The AI is fairly clever and is fun to play against, though sometimes it feels like they're cheating when they aim at you when you're cloaked.  The story is...well really cliche'd, but mostly engaging.  You nearly die a lot, it kind of gets a bit old.  I got this game as a gift, so I'm not sure if I would pay full price for it or not - but if it's on sale go for it!Having never played Crysis before, I had no idea what was going on with the story or why there are aliens in downtown New York, but that's not really important I suppose.  I'm a nano-suit wearing badass, I'm there to shoot them in the head not ask questions.  Also I couldn't flirt with the cute girl which was disappointing (couldn't shoot her either, also disappointing), but at least she doesn't die.  That would be very disappointing.I kind of like the soundtrack.  Also Lockheart hates me.  :(  What did I ever do to him!? "

												Sneak, or Blast, or Ambush, or Gun down muscle head soldiers or alien invaders...Notice that word: ""Or"", more on that later. Enjoy my reivew of Crysis 2 Story ~Prophet did what he could, after contracting the virus he entrusts the survival of mankind with you, by giving you the Nano Suit... just before he takes his own life. Sounds simple right? Well it pretty much is, and even though the game throws a few twists at you, it never feels like it is hard to grasp.You are entrusted with saving New York from an alien threat, and it becomes apparent how important you really are when you come face to face with the Ceph, who pose a pretty large threat if you try taking them down with normal means. They put up quite a fight, even for a fully suited super tech equipted Marine. Through video instructions you are able to see just how quickly the Ceph are taking over and pose a threat to the entire country if you do not act quickly. Gameplay ~Remember all of those Ors at the top of the review? Those options are what make Crysis 2 such a wonderful game to play. The game loads sections of the map at a time, unlike the first game, and tasks you with taking-out enemies (Or sneaking past them if you can) to complete objectives. When given these options and the ability to scan the area for weapons and threats, you have all the options in the world to beat each section however you see fit!The Nano Suit boasts 3 main powers that can activated or deactivated at will:-Sleath Mode          (Sneaky)-Armor Mode           (Tanky)-Power Mode          (Stabalize/Jump/Sprint)-and Tactical Mode  (...Tactical)Pick one, or pick them all, and enjoy ripping enemies to shreds by means you chose! Presentation The game is beautiful.Look at screen shots.I dont even need to write anything here. Final Thoughts Crysis does so much right, I am a huge sucker for choice in games, and an even BIGGER sucker for stealth in games done right.Each mode you can activate feels balanced and you have to adapt yourself to each one. Stealth is of course my favorite, and I would always do my best to get assassination kills with silenced weapons because when you expose yourself, some enemies will call for backup.+Great Musical Score that hit all the right notes when it needed to+Wonderful Pacing: You always felt like you were accomplishing something+Superb Gameplay complimented by unique weapons and gadgets+Tactics encouraged!+/- Graphical glitches on Ceph were farely common when executing.-Character dialogue was cheesy...very very cheesy9/10 Loved it "

												Can't remember the last time I played an FPS campaign all the way through. Very cool mechanics, good story, beautiful visuals. My only complaint is that the story seemed a bit long. Eventually, I switched to running through the missions hidden just to get through the game. Killing every alien is fun, but it will probably quadruple the game length. Well worth the one time through. Haven't even touched the multiplay or mods yet. That could get dangerous :)			"

												Crysis 2 is epic. It is easy to get lost amongst the sheer scale of the seph-torn cityscapes of Manhattan, a city breathing with life due to the technically impressive CryEngine 2. That's right, the graphics are spectacular, with a great attention to detail, and cater to a range of builds. Other than the jaw-dropping, mouth-watering visuals, the combat in this game is excellently paced, challenging and genuinely fun. There is a large variety to weapons and suit upgrades, accommodating for a great many number of playstyles. The soundtrack does very well to harmonise with the constant action, in particular the main theme, composed with grandeur by Hans Zimmer. The story is fairly straightforward, with a foreseeable arc, although it does have its fair share of surprises.Tl;dr Crysis 2 (Maximum Edition) is an excellent first-person action game, with beautiful visuals, varied gameplay and a really enjoyable campaign.9/10			"

												What the original Crysis had in atmosphere, Crysis 2 has in game- and gunplay.  Every encounter genuinely did offer multiple routes to the objective, each with legitimate pros and cons.  It truly came down to player choice; I don't remember any situation where the game tried ""forcing"" me one way or another.  Stealth functions well and the A.I. is fair and balanced.  I really felt awesome playing in the Nano suit.C2 functioned a lot smoother than the orig. too, it felt, and looks better on-screen than C1.  Musical score by Hans Zimmer is predictibly epic.9/10  Great game.			"

												It's different from Crysis and Crysis: Warhead.Openspaced Ling Shan islands were replaced by New York City full of narrow streets, tunnels and parks. Nanosuit modes were reduced and their usage is now more comfortable. Discarded modes are integrated into suit/controls, so now we can combine e.g. superjump or steady aim with stealth.Nanosuit upgrades are good, but at some point game becomes too easy with the right combination of them (played on soldier difficulty).Rest is about the same levels as previous games - music is epic, visuals are stunning and story is great.

There are lots of cinematics and in-game cutscenes. Crytek engine lets the game look stunning just like in Crysis 1. All in all, should be a great experience for most FPS fans.			"

												One word to describe it: Beautiful. It is absolutely beautiful. Even on mid end laptops like mine, it looks incredible. The color and lighting makes this game look so realistic, and the intro video to the game is the most epic intro I have ever seen in a game. The graphic quality is on par with the best games TODAY (Despite being almost 2 years old), and easily wins over most FPS. The score is by Hans Zimmer (who also composed the Dark Knight), and is very well done. The gameplay is special - it kind of reminds me of a combo of Battlefield, Blacklight: Retribution, and Halo. Elements from each game polishes this one, and the campaign is a lot of fun. Got it from the Humble Bundle, and very happy that I donated and got this game:) Overall: Graphics: 10 out of 10. This game challenges big ones like Planetside 2 and Battlefield 3 in terms of graphics. CryEngine 3 for the win!Gameplay: 9.5 out of 10. In this game, you are more than just a character... you are a WEAPON. Stealth and strength are your main tools; you can either choose to use stealth elements and make the combat feel like an FPS Metal Gear Solid game, or use ""Maximum"" elements and go bananas on the enemies using brute force. Campaign: 9.5 out of 10. Has good replay value, and long story line. Multiplayer: 8.5 out of 10. The multiplayer is awesome, but you may need to be very patient. My first few matches online were miserable... I was confused on how to set up my classes, and the people online are very competitive. There are lobbies dedicated for ""Recruits"", but those are always filled up, so good luck on ""Standard"" or  ""Pro"" lobbies. Doesn't take long to adapt, however.Overall score: 9.5 out of 10. All I could say is... I regret not buying this game any sooner. I will buy the entire series (Crysis Maximum Edition and then Crysis 3) very soon. A MUST play.  "

												Ah, Crysis 2. This is how people with dementia must feel when they forget who they are, what are they doing, why, and what they were supposed to be doing in the first place.The connection to the previous games is so bad , a spit in the face of the franchise and fans.The ''destroyed city'' thing fails and feels like ''shooter tutorial with detritus and junk everywhere''.Too many things happening, don't even know where to look.  Or why. Oh god why i have to aid some marines to their quest?  Everyone is attacked by anthropomorphic squids before any explanation is given. What do i want here in the first place? Right, a flood brought me here with these marines. Why am i following them?What did i do before the flood? Where i was going and why?I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING! Last time i checked, there was Mysterious Korea Frozen Icy Alien Machine Octopuses.How did i come to fight militaristic mansquids? Why am i locked in a ''shaky camera &  earthquakes'' cheap ''big fight'' with some cyborg?This is just an ''ok'' generic shooter with bad story and decent eyecandy. Nothing more.			"

												A some what generic corridor COD shooter but still regardless it is still a decent addition to the crysis series, excluding its cons id give it a 6.5/10, still worth a buy if its been decently discounted.Cons:It has a appalling fov of around 55 that you can’t change by default, a huge let down that makes the game alot less enjoyable.The game doesn’t remember your own personal keybinds if you choose to have your own, so every time you play the game you have to re-enter them in(i guess they don't care enough to fix it(shameful)).

												Crysis 2 is wonderful sequel to the original Crysis storyline, but the game does not crush modern systems as its predecessors. While dissapoining to some, Crysis 2 still remains to be one of the most beautiful games out there. Although, it doesn't provide the same ""sandboxed"" feeling as the first two, the maps do still offer a variety of approaches from full head-on assaults to stealth kills. Crysis 2 does excel in a more streamlined approach to using the nano suit so the gameplay remains fast, intense and versatile. The multiplayer component, however, can be summed up as a Call of Duty-styled system with the only differential being the nano suit and its level-induced upgrades.			"

												I coudn't make a new online account, and based on other reviews assumed its broken as well as multiplayer. So this review is only of the singleplayer campaign.In my opinion, this game is not worth the full price. Story took about 7 hours at a normal pace, and really wasn't all too engaging. As far as gameplay, I am 99% certain it is locked at 30 fps which was a downer, but I suppose you don't notice it too much in the middle of a fight. There is a good mix of environments and enemies, although towards the end it does get somewhat repetitive. Luckily you have a few different options for going about combat with your suit ablities (invisibility, armor ect.). There are a few bigger alien ""bosses"" that will be thrown in here and there, and really aren't too hard to get past. Visually the game looks awesome, and there is a good pace of changing environments.So with the rather short campaign, somewhat cliche story and locked fps, I woudn't reccomend getting this game at full price. But if you can pick it up at a good discount, it is a very entertaing game for what it is and a very nice challenge. Watch some gameplay and see if the mechanics appeal to you, they really can get quite fun.			"

												Crysis 2 starts the same as Crysis 1 finished; muddled, confused and frustrating. It very often leaves you fighting for your life, without any clear idea as to what you are actually supposed to be doing. This is a fault that plagues the game at a number of different points. The game doesn't give that sense of freedom that was in 1, feeling much more constrained and scripted; much most like a console game, which of course it is. One thing I really dislike is the inability to save whenever you like. All you get is checkpoint saves. This means that a particularly tough section you may have to play and listen to all the commentary again and again and again...! Having said all that, it's still a very enjoyable game. It gathers pace as you play it, so stick at it for a while. It's a definite ""must have"" even though I still prefer Crysis 1.			"

												Crysis 2 is a far better game than its predecessor. While the original Crysis was open world and featured destructable environments, Crysis 2 is more corridors connecting open areas. However, Crysis 2 makes up for this by having more streamlined gameplay, an interesting story, and a length of around 10 hours (more if you just have to stealth kill every enemy like I did). I played this expecting a beautiful but mindless shooter, and instead found an engaging plot that I wanted to get to see through to the end. I found out the game was written by Richard Morgan, a sci-fi writer known for his dystopian worlds. Next time maybe write that drawcard on the box Crytek?			"

												True to the CryEngine legacy Crysis 2 is visually a triumph but as a deep and immersive game it falls a little short. Not to say there isn't any enjoyment or fun to be had, it's just doesn't do anything that you could say was better than just good. For me this was due mostly to two main issues. A sparse/generic/confusing plot and mechanics that are at odds with each other.As far as the plot goes some of my qualms could come from not playing the original game. It's possible that the plethora of characters, that are used without much introduction, featured in the first installment. Most of your time is spent going to places to meet people who have to move for various reasons, forcing you to go to a different place to meet them in the next level. It just felt a little padded at times and a limited weapon set (or little incentive to use most of them) and not a lot of enemy variation fail to add any spice. Speaking in generalizations the plot is pretty typical alien invasion fare, with the biggest twist being your super suit which brings up my next issue.The main mechanical difference between the Crysis series and other FPS's is the super suit your character wears. The suit allows you to either cloak (invisibility) or armor (huge damage reduction) among other things like jumping higher, kicking large objects, and throwing most objects. The issue is that the two main suit modes are at odds which is really hard to design and balance as a dev. If you've played stealth games and military shooters then you'll know that level designs between the two are completely different. Things like enemy placement, difficulty and, numbers need to be different to deliver a great experience for either style. If you rush the suits stealth upgrade it almost completely breaks the game. With the fairly open levels, great for running and gunning in armor mode, you can essentially sneak past the rest of the game with ease which is pretty boring. Before the stealth upgrade I did have some tense stealth moments, an unaware enemy closing in on me in the open with just enough power to get to my next hiding spot but for the most part a silenced sniper rifle + cloaking = cake walk.After all that it may seem like you should avoid Crysis 2 at all costs but that really isn't the case. At full price it's a little hard to swallow but on sale it probably provides enough enjoyment and it certainly is good to look at. I have only played a little multiplayer but, with the exception of playing against over-leveled opponents, it was enjoyable and had variety.			"

												Solid first person shooter. It is very much a linear game which I have nothing against. On the second hardest difficulty the enemies are tough and do hurt you if you are not careful. Humans are laughably easy later on the game and offer no challenge at all. For me sneaking was the way to go. Sometimes I got bored and didn't kill enemies at all and just sneaked trough the levels. The shooting mechanics are basic, nothing wrong in them.Game had multiple assault rifles available. I think the first one you get was the best one. You get silencer, red dot sight and singleshot firing mode later on. That was my main weapon of choise. Second slot I filled with sniper-rifle, LMG or shotgun as I saw fit for the map. There were some special weapons also but I usually found no use for them. Gauss-rifle would have been nice to carry around but you get it so late in the game that there is little use for it.I didn't care about the plot that much. I found it stupid, a bit silly, full of cliches and offered no surprices for me.Visually the game looks very good. Especially when you think it is already five years old when I write this.I did not run into any serious bugs. I think it crashed on alt-tab couple of times, but that was partly my fault. I would not recommend anyone to pay 20€ for it, but if you get it on a sale certainly. If you like FPS-games, go for it.			"

												Game with purty graphics. Not as good as Crysis 1 in terms of gameplay and setting. Crysis 2 feels cramped and the tactical visor is a free cheat code and made the game easier by highlighting enemies, key spots, etc. Don't mark spots for grenade throws, TacVisor. I know what I'm doing. The suit ability controls are better now. Maximum Speed can be done just by sprinting, Maximum Power can be activated by simply holding the jump and melee buttons. Worst offender? Bad AI. Simply bad. You can see them walking to walls or just stand there looking at you.			"

												Crysis 2 offers great fun. It looks amazing and plays very well. I do not know how somebody can give it low scores frankly. Nanosuit is probably the best invention in recent years in video games. It offers many options to play the game. The MP is also phantastic. Crytek kept its promise and delivered a great game. Definitely worth to buy it.			"

												This game can be taxing on some computers but the overall game play is really fun. There are something I do not like in this game such as... The graphics go high, very high, ultra. The people with low end computers may struggle with this game. Also as i see it PVP is dead as far as i can tell the servers that are up have HIGH ping for anyone in the US. However the single player part of the game is really thought out and well developed. Oh and if you do beat the game make sure to play it again there are hidden achievments and easter eggs.			"

												Definite downgrade from the original Crysis. While the suit is much streamlined, this doesn't really help at all the core game.Way, way too linear, with most of the time only one -three ways to approach your next objective. And it's also pretty easy; you're nearly indestructible the whole game and the AI being crap doesn't help either. Low FOV, which results in your weapon taking up 1/4 of the screen, which is very annoying. Multiplayer was just Call of Duty with nanosuits.Graphically it's pretty good, but that's about it. I won't even comment on the story because honestly, who cares?			"

												Extremely overrated game...the game has very little enemy and weapon variety. The gameplay is very generic, and the stealth is subpar. It has some very nice looking levels and setpieces (the last one is jaw dropping), but they don't make up for the gameplay. The story is lame and forgettable. And the final boss? Just bad. Gets extra points for a very good soundtrack by Hans Zimmer.			"

												The Original Crysis was an excellent adventure, full of tactical options, interesting (although simple) plot, and unique mechanics, all brought together by an amazing engine. Sadly, Crysis 2 seems to drop EVERY ball it was handed.The plot is almost non-existant, as if they wrote five minutes of story and dragged it out over eight hours. Half the game they don't even tell you what's going on. They put you in this super suit and just expect you to walk from point A to B for four hours, killing people who try to kill you.The tactical options are all there, but they shove them down your throat, telling you that there are new tactical options available every checkpoint, literally marking where you should stealth or snipe from effectively. It takes the decision making process out completely, and the whole game plays like a tutorial.Even the engine seems less impressive than the original game, with poor AI and meager graphics.I loved the first game, but this entry turned me off of the series entirely. Do yourself a favor, just enjoy the Original game, and steer clear of this mess.			"

												 After playing this for an endless amount of hours and having my eyes burn like they are on fire, i have fully realized that this is damn good game.Damn well made storyline that managed to keep even me interested in this game for many hours.The combat system is the same like your average First-Person shooter game combat system.The only downside is that there is Stealth in this game, i don't know why, it feels like it should not be there because you get spotted easily but at the same time, you cloak, which has the need for a stealth system in this game.7.5 / 10			"

												It's not a bad game but not at all stellar. Not as good as the first. The action is pretty good but it's far less open than the original, the UI is dumbed down with ""go here"" and ""take this ammo"" prompts doing all the hard work for you, and worst of all it's absolutely saturated with long, boring, dreadful, horribly written, unskippable cutscenes. Every few minutes without fail. You'll be begging to just play, slamming your ESC key and clicking madly, to no avail. You must endure every idiotic word of every utterly uninteresting cutscene every single time you play, and they are very frequent. Often you can't even control your camera - just take your hands off the controls and accept that you're watching a 3D rendered movie. It's for this reason that I decided not to buy any sequels and I advise you not to buy this one.Checkpoints with no quicksave, very low FOV, stupid collectibles like Statue of Liberty souveniers that you put in your pocket while saving the world - this is a console game in all the worst ways.Just replay Crysis 1. It's far more satisfying than this lame sequel.			"

												CRYSIS 2 MAXIMUM EDITION is a first-person shooter video game developed by Crytek, published by Electronic Arts and released in 2011 as CRYSIS 2 REGULAR EDITION before being later released as CRYSIS 2 MAXIMUM EDITION in 2012. It is the sequel to CRYSIS aka CRYSIS 1.Set during the Great Depression of 2023, CRYSIS 2 MAXIMUM EDITION focuses on Prophet, a nanosuit-wearing mute soldier from a poor family of tenant farmers driven from their Oklahoma home by drought, economic hardship, agricultural industry changes, and bank foreclosures forcing tenant farmers out of work. Due to his nearly hopeless situation, and in part because he was trapped in the alien invasion apocalypse, Prophet sets out for New York. Along with thousands of other generic gun-fodder soldiers, he sought jobs, land, dignity, big guns that can murder ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and a future.CRYSIS 2 MAXIMUM EDITION is infrequently played in American high school and college literature classes due to its lack of historical context and nonexistent legacy, plus the fact it is a video game, not a book. A sequel, CRYSIS 3 MAXIMUMEST EDITION was released in 2013 to general lack of interest, but it's only on Origin, and who would want to use Origin? Nobody, that's who.Anyway, CRYSIS 2 MAXIMUM EDITION is not very good.			"

												While I wish my Crysis and Warhead games were on Steam instead of DVD so i could review those more publically, all we get is Crysis 2.Since I have not finished C3 I can only work any comparisons to C1 and WH. I know the tech is older, but guess what, C1 and WH are better than C2 in some ways.Now, while C2 starts out pretty awesome, because were I ever dying, that would be the only cool way to be saved, and it continues to build into the story and unknown environment with some nice suspense, as you proceed you will start to be dragged around a bit. This means you start by working your way into yourself, building prowess and skills, and get to making some friends. But then, your new pals start to tell you what to do, how to do it, when to do it, etc. Which is fine for a bit, ""Sure I'll help you out, grab that latte, make a copy of that document..."", but drags on in such a manor for a length of time that starts to get agggrevating. Am I not practically a superhuman? Can I not kick a car into your face from 20 yards? If you give the marine grunt spec-ops mentality a leeway, you can at least cover your lack of independence there. No worries though. Towards the end, you will still be told some things you need to do, but you will have more of a freelance, superhero feel gathered with your actions. And the only issue is the realization that someone has been able to know the dirty things you were thinking about that CIA vixen.*Notes:The custom 1912x1076 resolution some players needed for C1 and WH does not seem to be necessary for C2. If you have experience with C1 and WH, you likely had performance issues. This is the old poorly optimised engines. Crysis 2, even though a heavier engine, with better graphics, ran much better on my system. Which is exactly the same as it was when I completed C1 and WH.*Pros.Nice environments/Better graphics than C1 and WHGreat audio/SoundtrackLots of pointless collectiblesExcept for a point at the beginning in the city, ran much better than C1 and some better than WHMore viable/easy to work with Nanosuit, let's hope they didn't fubar NS 3.0 eh?Decent arsenal and modifications/easier to work with and accessDecent storylineCompletely different alien enemiesCons.More linear gameplay than C1 and WHSome suit upgrades are pointless, others ar used for less than 1 minuteWeapons dont seem quite as moddable as in C1 and WHPretty much no vehicle utility or availablility, a staple for C1 and WHMuch of the game you play a mindless drone, I mean a marine....Lots of pointless collectiblesNew suit setup requires more attention so you don't get ROFLStompedAt first the human enemies make sense, but as time passes, you begin to wonder why they are such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to you, and you never really find out why. So you are required to assume its Epeen envyLess fun and challenging aliens, literally a pushover, if you get my meaning....Overall.A graphically enhanced, tighter gameplay, non-story-bridging game that provided me 21 hours of what I feel is time decently spent.

												The only reason people don't like this game is because they believe they do not need a focus on good graphics to have a good game. So the graphics in this are so astronomically great that the game itself suffers from a poor lack of focus on gameplay even though that is not the case. If you like any of the Metro games you will enjoy this game for its stealth or loud options and good story; there is also a PvP multiplayer mode which associates this game with cod which a lot of people like to not like too.Put this game up on the Source Engine and you automatically have a game of the year for the same gameplay with lesser graphics.peopleareonlywritingpositivereviewsforthegraphics/10			"

												While I wish my Crysis and Warhead games were on Steam instead of DVD so i could review those more publically, all we get is Crysis 2.Since I have not finished C3 I can only work any comparisons to C1 and WH. I know the tech is older, but guess what, C1 and WH are better than C2 in some ways.Now, while C2 starts out pretty awesome, because were I ever dying, that would be the only cool way to be saved, and it continues to build into the story and unknown environment with some nice suspense, as you proceed you will start to be dragged around a bit. This means you start by working your way into yourself, building prowess and skills, and get to making some friends. But then, your new pals start to tell you what to do, how to do it, when to do it, etc. Which is fine for a bit, ""Sure I'll help you out, grab that latte, make a copy of that document..."", but drags on in such a manor for a length of time that starts to get agggrevating. Am I not practically a superhuman? Can I not kick a car into your face from 20 yards? If you give the marine grunt spec-ops mentality a leeway, you can at least cover your lack of independence there. No worries though. Towards the end, you will still be told some things you need to do, but you will have more of a freelance, superhero feel gathered with your actions. And the only issue is the realization that someone has been able to know the dirty things you were thinking about that CIA vixen.*Notes:The custom 1912x1076 resolution some players needed for C1 and WH does not seem to be necessary for C2. If you have experience with C1 and WH, you likely had performance issues. This is the old poorly optimised engines. Crysis 2, even though a heavier engine, with better graphics, ran much better on my system. Which is exactly the same as it was when I completed C1 and WH.*Pros.Nice environments/Better graphics than C1 and WHGreat audio/SoundtrackLots of pointless collectiblesExcept for a point at the beginning in the city, ran much better than C1 and some better than WHMore viable/easy to work with Nanosuit, let's hope they didn't fubar NS 3.0 eh?Decent arsenal and modifications/easier to work with and accessDecent storylineCompletely different alien enemiesCons.More linear gameplay than C1 and WHSome suit upgrades are pointless, others ar used for less than 1 minuteWeapons dont seem quite as moddable as in C1 and WHPretty much no vehicle utility or availablility, a staple for C1 and WHMuch of the game you play a mindless drone, I mean a marine....Lots of pointless collectiblesNew suit setup requires more attention so you don't get ROFLStompedAt first the human enemies make sense, but as time passes, you begin to wonder why they are such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to you, and you never really find out why. So you are required to assume its Epeen envyLess fun and challenging aliens, literally a pushover, if you get my meaning....Overall.A graphically enhanced, tighter gameplay, non-story-bridging game that provided me 21 hours of what I feel is time decently spent.

												It may be short, it may be linear, it may not be as good as Crysis 1. But Crysis 2 is bloody good fun and worth picking up cheap if you're into sci-fi shooters. The setting is great, what the story lacks is made up for by the visuals and mostly solid voice acting. The gameplay can be challenging and in my opinion this game is better than the follow up - Crysis 3.Multiplayer probably isn't worth your time though if anyone even plays it anymore.			"

												Crysis 2 is an FPS in steroid and that's a good thing because obviously you look like one. As much as I love the original Crysis in which you can devise many ways to complete a mission (it's a sandbox game after all), in this sequels it just feels so constricted. There are many debris blocking your way which forces you on where to go. It doesn't feel like the typical Crysis, in fact it feels like you are playing Call of Duty.It's pretty addicting though. Highly recommended.			"

This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend Crysis 2 Maximum Edition skip to Results and read from there.Crytek Studios Continues the series optimizing the interface and mixing up the story with its third extension to the Crysis experience. Crysis 2 Maximum Edition is a great example of a first person shooter that mixes up traditional style FPS with amazing dynamics. Story:Crysis 2 Maximum Edition starts off with a group of marines in flight to New York City in order to support military operations against alien invaders. The mission goes horribly wrong as submarine is blaster out of the water almost immediately leaving the entire crew marooned without communications; yet, it’s shortly lived because as soon as the crew emerges all but one are destroyed by an alien aircraft. It is up to you Alcatraz (a name they chose for obvious reasons) to continue on with a mission handed down to you as a legacy. You must push through the bowels of New York City fighting against humans and aliens alike in order to succeed! With the Nano Suit there is nothing that can truly stand in your way.Campaign:Crysis 2 is a relatively long campaign depending on your gameplay style and difficulty preferences. The game has a mediocre difficulty curve at best making the hardest game mode relatively easy for a seasoned gamer. Regardless if you decide for a slower paced game knock the difficulty up to Post-Human Warrior otherwise take a lower difficulty and just enjoy the ride. The campaign has an amazing depth in the level varieties and methods of completion. There are about eighteen levels which vary in how you can play them as well as the various opponents, options, and surprises within; although, there are actually only a few different enemies the way they are mixed and how they are placed make them seem like new posing challenges every step of the way. The game is played with a combination of sequences where you are either alone in the dark or surrounded by marine allies. Overall the campaign is relatively fun and definitely has high replay value due to the dynamics of the gameplay. Gameplay:The controls are relatively simple which makes this game easy and entertaining to play. There were no points during the game where I was annoyed with gameplay elements, such as camera angles or controls. Hiding behind cover is very useful as you can pop over without having to stand up simply by using your sights. Unlike in the first Crysis there are really only two suit modes: Armor and Stealth. Power takes up both strength and speed and activates automatically when you hold space to jump or shift to run. This makes those abilities a lot more useful as I noticed in the first Crysis I never used super strength or speed just because of how inconvenient it was to switch mid battle then switch back. Just like the original there are loads of customizations for each weapon, but they’ve pushed it even further offering way more weapon choices and tons of different gameplay strategies; although I didn’t grab them all I believe there are about 20 weapons ranging from pistols, assault rifles, light machine guns, rockets, sniper rifles, explosives, and more. So depending on your gameplay you can either sneak with stealth and use silenced weapons or run and gun with light machine guns and armor. One of the major additions to Crysis 2 is the Nano Suit upgrades which allow you to optimize the suit and enhance your gameplay strengths. There are four different brackets which each contain three upgrades, but you can only have one active in each slot meaning if you buy all three for Armor you can only use one of the upgrades at a time. Hints:>Save up for the highest level upgrades, they are the only ones you’ll really need and they make a huge difference in your strength. The maximum armor upgrade costs 12,000 and the maximum stealth costs 10,000.>Make sure you run over enemy aliens after defeating them in order to collect the nano points needed for suit upgrades. Heavy Ceph Devastators give 500 nano points, but if you don’t run over them shortly after killing them the spores disappear and you get nothing.  >The most expensive upgrade 16,000 is only used in the campaign at the very end where you fight four cloaked enemies. Be smart if you tag them with your binoculars you can track them anyway.>Any time you find a machine gun post you can rip off the heavy machine gun [HMG] and use it. It has 150 bullets and is incredibly powerful. I found myself using HMGs more than my regular weapons. >Unlike the first Crysis the Stealth in to kill and enemy and stealth out tactic doesn’t work as well. The enemies can see you if they are close while you are stealth. Results:Crysis 2 Maximum Edition was a fantastic game with loads of dynamics offering high replay value. If you are a fan of FPS this is a great game to buy and play. I honestly buy all my games at 75% off, but this would have been worth spending the whole $29.99 on, which is rare for me to say the least. One of the great things about Crysis is you can choose your play style, you can go in quietly and assassinate your enemies like Sam Fisher or you can run in like Space Marine and gun down your foes like hordes of orcs. The campaign has a large number of levels which provide a great experience.   Pros:+Loads of weapons to choose from with dynamic customizations: Grenade launchers, shotgun attachments, silencers, semi/full fire, red dot, reflex, sniper, laser attachment, and more. +Awesome levels which are semi-destructible; use an HMG to blast up a wall near an opponent in order to flank them out (does not apply to all walls).+Cool vehicles, although you don’t use them much the tank missions and the Humvees are a fun aspect of the game. +Awesome suit customization, take your suit and make it for your gameplay strategy by purchasing armor enhancement augmentations or optimizing your stealth. +Suit strength and speed are auto activated rather than require a special mode to use. +Loads of different levels which take you all over New York City taking you through buildings, underground, through streets, under water, or into parks. +Good enemy AI, unlike the first one where the enemies would let you stealth shoot one and then stealth and walk two steps to the left and repeat these ones are a bit smarter. They will detect you and even flank you if they are high enough in numbers. +Good story although I have a con about this as well the story is great and is highly intriguing. Cons:-Although I did enjoy the story my major con is how it doesn’t continue with the elements from Crysis, and Crysis Warhead. In fact it kind of transforms into something else, not necessarily worse but just different. In the original the enemies were robotic and manufacturing themselves through a facility on an uncharted island. Yet in Crysis 2 the enemies were organic and creating themselves from the living tissue of infected humans. This completely changes how the story even seems logical, in the first Crysis they were in hibernation deep underground while in this one it seems to be the same yet they are organic and sentient?-Checkpoints were few and far between at some points. This was more a nuisance than anything, there were points where you’d fight for about 20-30 minutes and then die on the last enemy before a checkpoint. Resetting you back thirty minutes earlier and making you go “ugh”.-Some checkpoints were triggered before cinematics, this meant if you died you were launched back prior to a cinematic and had to watch it again without being able to skip.-Apparently multiplayer does not work for this game – I personally don’t play multiplayer but if you do then this may be a deal breaker for you.

ConsolizationCrytek decides to address the consoles for its next chapter of Crysis, enriching its history but with the consequences of being designed to run on limited hardware.PROS:- Excellent artistic direction (although it was designed thinking on consoles, Crysis 2 boasts a spectacular design of the city of New York, enemies and characters).- Wonderful attention to detail (from the photos on posters of missing people in the disaster to the inside of a newsstand, Crytek's hand into this title is pretty evident).- Solid and immersive history (a new step forward in the narrative structure of the series, answering questions from the previous installments and paving the way towards the close of the trilogy).- Weapons arsenal quite varied and original.- Long Campaign (beyond collectibles scattered in the most remote corners of the maps and the relentless search for accessories for your equipment that may already increase your playtime).- Improved IA over previous titles (although there is the possibility that enemies can ""stuck"" in specific places of the maps).CONS:- Consolized (From the ridiculous FOV of the render of the weapon you hold, passing through the reduced level design and ending with the simplification of controls and gameplay elements).- Multiplayer support is discontinued (with the shutdown of GameSpy servers there is no active multiplayer... but, there are ways...)A solid game all around, especially in the artistic and narrative department. However, fans of the two previous installments probably be disappointed when they see how much the saga has been reduced, technologically speaking.My Score: 8/10Note: Played it on Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate - 64 bits			"

												It may be short, it may be linear, it may not be as good as Crysis 1. But Crysis 2 is bloody good fun and worth picking up cheap if you're into sci-fi shooters. The setting is great, what the story lacks is made up for by the visuals and mostly solid voice acting. The gameplay can be challenging and in my opinion this game is better than the follow up - Crysis 3.Multiplayer probably isn't worth your time though if anyone even plays it anymore.			"

												A major thing to note is that as of june 2014 multiplayer servers are offline due to the Gamespy shutdown. So don't buy this expecting a multiplayer, and knowing EA they probably won't do anything to resolve it any time soon.At the Full price of $30 usd at the moment I don't feel it's worth it. If you find it at half price or less I'd say it's worth picking up.  Single Player:The story is well developed and sticks to the storyline of the crysis and warhead and evolves it quite well, which is apreciated these days. The customizable nanosuit was a nice addition in making the game fit your playing style a bit better. On another note the story is very linear, basically there's not really much replay value. It's also a pretty short campaign which sadly I've come to expect anymore.Graphically:Crysis 2 does feel a little watered down compared to it's predecessor, probably due to trying to break into the console market at the time. Don't get me wrong it is a gorgeous game texture and lighting effect wise, it just feels like all of the small deails built into crysis and crysis warhead were lost with this release.			"

												I quite enjoyed my time with You Gotta Get Outta Here Simulator 2011, known in PAL territories as We're Outta Time Buy Me More Time 2.Here's the thing about this game,I didn't like it much when I first played it, on all but the highest setting, yeah you can do things how you like, but that means you hardly have to think at all, just gunning everyone down is a reasonable option as long as you stand in a corner.My second playthrough, however, I bumped up the difficulty to the highest, and that's when it became apparent to me how refined the gameplay really is.  You're forced to learn little tricks and make certain tradeoffs, you're made to choose precisely from which angle you want to initiate an attack.  It's really very well done, and much more refined than the original Crysis, which I believe to be overhyped on account of its eye candy.There are certainly cons though, so I'll list everything out here in bullets:PROS----------Beautiful graphics (if a little “smoky” at times)Adjustable FOV (thank god for that cause it's awful)Really smart, approachable, tactical gameplay (love)Optimised suit controls over the first gameReally optimised performance-wise over the first gameSmarter weapon customisation systemSuit upgrade system adds much-needed depthNewGame+  (more or less)CONS---------*Really* generic, boring, military characters*Really* generic, boring, military dialogue*Really* generic, boring, military soundtrack*Really* generic, boring, military cutscenesLots of weapons but still only two at a time (hate)16 suit upgrades but only 4 at a time (haaate)No useful unlocks of any kind from any difficulty completionCONCLUSION-----------------If you're into standard military shooters, you'll find something extra here, and doubtless have a good time.If not, you'll have to take time to understand the game's mechanics fully before you can really appreciate it, and have to sit through a *lot* of dumb, tough-guy talk, but it's still very possible to have a great time if you focus on the fantastic stealth gameplay.Crysis 1 - 8/10Crysis 2 - 8/10Crysis 3 - 7/10			"

												Crysis 2 is not a bad game, but falls short of its predecessors by a fairly large margin. It follows Crysis Warhead's level design - fairly wide but straightforward route to objectives intersected by large combat spaces plus some tighter sections thrown in - but fails to replicate it as effectively. The levels just aren't as well-designed or interesting as the previous games. Gameplay has also changed for the worse; The new nanosuit has a buffed armour mode and pemits stealth kills to better utilize stealth, but speed and strength are nerfed. This limits your options to mainly armour or cloak, and makes combat more dull, especially with the less noticeable physics, mostly absent ragdolling and more limited vehicle combat. I also preferred Crysis Warhead's interpretation of the alien enemies than the ones here. Nevertheless, the singleplayer campaign is still solid and enjoyable. Just don't expect something like the previous games.			"

This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend Crysis 2 Maximum Edition skip to Results and read from there.Crytek Studios Continues the series optimizing the interface and mixing up the story with its third extension to the Crysis experience. Crysis 2 Maximum Edition is a great example of a first person shooter that mixes up traditional style FPS with amazing dynamics. Story:Crysis 2 Maximum Edition starts off with a group of marines in flight to New York City in order to support military operations against alien invaders. The mission goes horribly wrong as submarine is blaster out of the water almost immediately leaving the entire crew marooned without communications; yet, it’s shortly lived because as soon as the crew emerges all but one are destroyed by an alien aircraft. It is up to you Alcatraz (a name they chose for obvious reasons) to continue on with a mission handed down to you as a legacy. You must push through the bowels of New York City fighting against humans and aliens alike in order to succeed! With the Nano Suit there is nothing that can truly stand in your way.Campaign:Crysis 2 is a relatively long campaign depending on your gameplay style and difficulty preferences. The game has a mediocre difficulty curve at best making the hardest game mode relatively easy for a seasoned gamer. Regardless if you decide for a slower paced game knock the difficulty up to Post-Human Warrior otherwise take a lower difficulty and just enjoy the ride. The campaign has an amazing depth in the level varieties and methods of completion. There are about eighteen levels which vary in how you can play them as well as the various opponents, options, and surprises within; although, there are actually only a few different enemies the way they are mixed and how they are placed make them seem like new posing challenges every step of the way. The game is played with a combination of sequences where you are either alone in the dark or surrounded by marine allies. Overall the campaign is relatively fun and definitely has high replay value due to the dynamics of the gameplay. Gameplay:The controls are relatively simple which makes this game easy and entertaining to play. There were no points during the game where I was annoyed with gameplay elements, such as camera angles or controls. Hiding behind cover is very useful as you can pop over without having to stand up simply by using your sights. Unlike in the first Crysis there are really only two suit modes: Armor and Stealth. Power takes up both strength and speed and activates automatically when you hold space to jump or shift to run. This makes those abilities a lot more useful as I noticed in the first Crysis I never used super strength or speed just because of how inconvenient it was to switch mid battle then switch back. Just like the original there are loads of customizations for each weapon, but they’ve pushed it even further offering way more weapon choices and tons of different gameplay strategies; although I didn’t grab them all I believe there are about 20 weapons ranging from pistols, assault rifles, light machine guns, rockets, sniper rifles, explosives, and more. So depending on your gameplay you can either sneak with stealth and use silenced weapons or run and gun with light machine guns and armor. One of the major additions to Crysis 2 is the Nano Suit upgrades which allow you to optimize the suit and enhance your gameplay strengths. There are four different brackets which each contain three upgrades, but you can only have one active in each slot meaning if you buy all three for Armor you can only use one of the upgrades at a time. Hints:>Save up for the highest level upgrades, they are the only ones you’ll really need and they make a huge difference in your strength. The maximum armor upgrade costs 12,000 and the maximum stealth costs 10,000.>Make sure you run over enemy aliens after defeating them in order to collect the nano points needed for suit upgrades. Heavy Ceph Devastators give 500 nano points, but if you don’t run over them shortly after killing them the spores disappear and you get nothing.  >The most expensive upgrade 16,000 is only used in the campaign at the very end where you fight four cloaked enemies. Be smart if you tag them with your binoculars you can track them anyway.>Any time you find a machine gun post you can rip off the heavy machine gun [HMG] and use it. It has 150 bullets and is incredibly powerful. I found myself using HMGs more than my regular weapons. >Unlike the first Crysis the Stealth in to kill and enemy and stealth out tactic doesn’t work as well. The enemies can see you if they are close while you are stealth. Results:Crysis 2 Maximum Edition was a fantastic game with loads of dynamics offering high replay value. If you are a fan of FPS this is a great game to buy and play. I honestly buy all my games at 75% off, but this would have been worth spending the whole $29.99 on, which is rare for me to say the least. One of the great things about Crysis is you can choose your play style, you can go in quietly and assassinate your enemies like Sam Fisher or you can run in like Space Marine and gun down your foes like hordes of orcs. The campaign has a large number of levels which provide a great experience.   Pros:+Loads of weapons to choose from with dynamic customizations: Grenade launchers, shotgun attachments, silencers, semi/full fire, red dot, reflex, sniper, laser attachment, and more. +Awesome levels which are semi-destructible; use an HMG to blast up a wall near an opponent in order to flank them out (does not apply to all walls).+Cool vehicles, although you don’t use them much the tank missions and the Humvees are a fun aspect of the game. +Awesome suit customization, take your suit and make it for your gameplay strategy by purchasing armor enhancement augmentations or optimizing your stealth. +Suit strength and speed are auto activated rather than require a special mode to use. +Loads of different levels which take you all over New York City taking you through buildings, underground, through streets, under water, or into parks. +Good enemy AI, unlike the first one where the enemies would let you stealth shoot one and then stealth and walk two steps to the left and repeat these ones are a bit smarter. They will detect you and even flank you if they are high enough in numbers. +Good story although I have a con about this as well the story is great and is highly intriguing. Cons:-Although I did enjoy the story my major con is how it doesn’t continue with the elements from Crysis, and Crysis Warhead. In fact it kind of transforms into something else, not necessarily worse but just different. In the original the enemies were robotic and manufacturing themselves through a facility on an uncharted island. Yet in Crysis 2 the enemies were organic and creating themselves from the living tissue of infected humans. This completely changes how the story even seems logical, in the first Crysis they were in hibernation deep underground while in this one it seems to be the same yet they are organic and sentient?-Checkpoints were few and far between at some points. This was more a nuisance than anything, there were points where you’d fight for about 20-30 minutes and then die on the last enemy before a checkpoint. Resetting you back thirty minutes earlier and making you go “ugh”.-Some checkpoints were triggered before cinematics, this meant if you died you were launched back prior to a cinematic and had to watch it again without being able to skip.-Apparently multiplayer does not work for this game – I personally don’t play multiplayer but if you do then this may be a deal breaker for you.

												Oh dear... this is a bit of a mess...It looks stunning... of course it does... it's Crysis.The story is a confusing mess with some genius geek nerd guy mansplaining gobbledygook to you over the radio... after about 20 mins you won't care about the story.Gameplay is much the same as the first game and very satisfying when the game gives you the freedom to be inventive. New features and abilities are all well designed and make for a fun playing experience.The main problem with this game is the level design and it's desperate need to try and be cinematic.Level design wise, even with objective markers and all the help the HUD gave me I still ended up in dead end after dead end, trying to figure out where to go. At times the comms from the professor dude were just misleading and led to a lot of frustration. The battle in the lab against the chopper is a good example with the doc screaming at you to get out but actually there is no way out of the lab at that point.The games need to be cinematic is also really frustrating. The first half of the first game did a great job of giving you a really large play area to explore and be inventive with. Here you're just been led by the nose from one set piece to the next. The controls are taken away from you on  a regular basis and your view is forced into whaever cinematic event that comes next. The game shows you amazing things that you probably would like to have done yourself... but it was too my trouble for them to design.. so instead you can just watch it instead.If you liked Crysis 1 then you'll like Crysis 2... just not as much......and don't expect to care about anything that is going on... at all...

												Maximum edition? More like maximum bugged port.I don't know what happened during development of this game. My best guess is they wanted to focus on a console market, and that's what all PC gamers got: A terrible port which has been downgraded in all departments compared to the first game. This is how Crytek wants to deal with high amount of piracy from their first Crysis: ""You're interested in our IP? Have a bag of♥♥♥♥♥♥with Crysis 2 tagged onto it, since you're just going to pirate it anyway.""I feel like the PC audience has been alienated here.There's just so many things that went wrong with developing this game. The game doesn't even want me to beat it cause like I wrote in my first paragraph, you will encounter both in-game bugs and technical bugs that  can result in crash to desktop. This edition of the game somehow manages to have more bugs than the leaked beta test. It controls like the first Crysis, however, your nano suit has been casualized only to carry OP mode, stealth, binoculars which are only used as a waypoint system to find ammo, and nightvision, which is only viable to use in like freaking 3 parts of the whole game. Gotta have something to support that console controller! The checkpoint system WILL drive you nuts. It rarely logs down your progress on your map and just seem to live breathe its own life. If you get a CTD during a map, enjoy being thrown all the way back to the beginning of the map.Avoid this, even if you liked the first game. It's not a PC game, it's a quick money grab to make up for all the cash they didn't earn with their first game. I hope you got this through the cheap EA bundle like me. I feel bad for anyone actually getting this for full price.			"

They took all the fun of the original away, instead of semi-open world there are now only corridors, and the game becomes just a typical clicker: move 5 meters, shoot 5 people, move another 5 meters to shoot next 5 people... well, you also get a suit that lets you mecome invisible, so you have basically a cheat-system in-game. Yeah, totally fun. Avoid, even if you liked the first Crysis a lot, like I did.			"

												Crysis 2 is a game about a dying soldier named Alcatraz becomes a living savior called ""Prophet"" (Still Alcatraz though). So basically this is what happens if you won't vote for Donald Trump, a lot of illegal aliens invade our lovely planet, earth.The gameplay is similiar to Far Cry, you either die a Rambo or live to become a Hitman (Pretty much means it's loud or stealth).For a 5 years old game, the graphic is absolutely fantastic and this game runs smoothly. It's even better than current game graphic, and also this game is moddable so you can use mods to fuc*ing around, but unfortunately i cant use some graphic mods for unknown reason.I found two bugs. First, there were two enemies running toward me but there is a car so those guys just keep pushing the car and running in circle. Second, if you turn on subtitle, the subtitle wont go even there is no one talking.I think that Nano Suit upgrade is useless. Seriously, in the end of the level there are 4 cloak aliens that will give you 5000 Nano Catalyst but the game is about to over.This game wont let you finish this game easily, dying can set you back so far, so don't die.Dead multiplayer doesn't mean the game is not playable anymore after you finish the game. I think that this game is replayable. if you finish the game using stealthy way, why dont you restart and finish this game using loud way?A perfect score for a perfect game, 9/10.			"

												To be short, lame shallow corridor gameplay with buggy AI and other game mechanics shortcommings... but with beautiful graphics. After hearing so many years about the 'epic' Crysis and now finally trying it out myself I am far from impressed by the gameplay. However, I bought it at 80% off and I will probably put a dozen hours in it just to see the locations and shiny graphics.On a hefty sale it's worth it, otherwise don't bother, there are many better fps games out there.

												Its OK for a modern FPS. The graphics are pretty. While the human enemies are boring to play against, the alien enemies were somewhat reminiscent of good old FPSs (but not quite there). They were pretty fun to fight against, but the AI was pretty buggy. There was only 6 enemy types. The levels were also much linear than Crysis, and slightly more linear than Far Cry. Story was alright for a video game, but there were a bit too many cinematics. It's good if you got it in the EA humble bundle. Otherwise, I don't recommend it. Oh, and I recommend starting the game on the hardest difficulty.			"

												Okaayy.. I'll start by saying that Crysis 2 is crap compared to the first one, i mean.. Crysis 2 is just another generic fps (even though it has those suit abilities), levels are linear, vehicles are now useless, optimized poorly, not much variety in enemies, using the abilities with the new suit is not fun anymore, city makes all of the levels so closed and not leaving you much of a choice but to go the way the game wants you to unlike in first Crysis where you could hide in a jungle and take different paths. And now the BIGGEST PROBLEM I had with this game is that RAGE-INDUCING half second delay after you release right mouse button it really made this game unplayable for me (and most probably for pretty much anyone else).I really hate the changes they made so I can't recommend this game.

I have no ♥♥♥♥ing idea, its weird, its complicated, you are sent in to rescue a guy, but instead you end up taking the nanosuit from his coworker and replacing him and then you fight aliens and aliens and CELL soldiers.The gameplay ?

Irritating game controls that dose not play much like the Original(mostly the crappy Lean left and right and no prone that pisses me off).The quick suit menu is in a diffrent order and going right from crysis to this I'm use to that and keep picking the wrong option.Not a big deal but come on keep it consistant so when people move right from the last game to this it feels familiar.I do like the dedacated buttons for suit options though, just hit a key for cloak or armor.Lean left and right are worthless, you use your mouse to lean when you aim down sight by a wall, What the hell MORE CONSOLE LEFTOVER CRAP.(after play for a bit of time I'm a little use to this and at times it has its merits. You can peak over stuff with more precision then just going from crouching to standing but for leaning left and right it's still not as good as the original game).No quick save just check points. More leftover CONSOLE CRAP (I can deal with this but sometimes I need to go do other things and then I have to leave the game going or lose my progression).This next thing bugs me the most.At times you can't even look where you want to, the game forces you to look at what they want you too see or the suit goes into tactical override and tells you how to turn on the cloak or armor mode like your some fool. This kind of crap ruins replay value for me,eveytime I play the game it going to tell me how to play the game, I DON'T LIKE THAT. And the prompts that tell you what key you need to use to do stuff clutter the screen as I'm trying to play.(and theres no option to turn that off)I want to feel like I'm there, not watching through someone else's eyes or being babysat and told what to do.I could understand it maybe telling you how to use the suit if your playing on the easiest difficulty but I went right for the hardest and don't need any damn help.I Have been playing FPS games since I was ten.I dont usually make reviews but this games lack of a good lean and prone and handholding sucks so I had to rant about it somewhere.Even the video settings lack options like anti aliasing, something you expect in any modern game.The game looks good, that's the only nice thing I have to say about it, It is what Diablo 3 is to Diablo 2.A let down.Not the worst sequal but not what I wanted or was expecting.I may be a bit over critical because I absolutely hate how consoles are dumbing down gaming, And there is no reason for it.JUST MAKE THE GAMES FOR PC AND PORT THEM TO CONSOLE AND EVERYONE WILL BE HAPPY.They might lose stuff, but they are not likely to complan about it because thats how it has to be to work on there console systems, but it dosent need to be that way on PC.After getting use to all the CONSOLE CRAP this game has, I Am having fun. But cannot recommend this game becaus it would be promoting the degradation of good PC gaming.Edit:Now that I have completed the game I can say It was fun and the story was not bad. Though the aliens are nothing like the first game and the ones from the first game do not make a appearance(thay are the same aliens but the squid like exoskeletons from the first are not in this one).If you gave the game another name and renamed the few people that are taken form the first game you would have another game just with the same nanosuit not really a sequel.Not really a bad thing per se, just seems odd to me.Still I feel it was a degradation of what could have been a better PC game. I got it for free when my brother got me the humble bundle. Having played it now I would not want to have payed more then $5 for it.			"

												I'm disappointed. Compared to the first game, sequel is just too linear, I found it boring. Game have zero replayability - stupid and frustrating saving system makes collectibles completely pointless. The story is predictable and graphics are not as impressive as in Crysis & Crysis Warhead.(I played the game on Origin, thus my low in-game time.)			"

												Crysis 2 is the linear sequel to an 'open world' Crysis, that became a more straightforward title. It was a promising title that fell short compared to its predecessor, ultimately failing to deliver an above-average experience beyond its next-gen appeal for its time.It's only recommendable buying when on discount, when all you want is an 8hr experience of cinematic action.Pros:+Great graphics.++Superb sound effects.++Well detailed environments.++Engaging gunplay.+Slightly interesting although predictable story.Cons:-Short Single Player.-Very much linear single player mode, go to point A to point B in a nutshell.--Poorly optimized engine, framerate drops.--Very glitchy and buggy. (Some alien stealth kills pop artifacts out of nowhere)--No multiplayer (it wasn't too bright anyway -- very little people played it after its first year of release).--Poorly implemented mechanics, ie. The Stealth detector upgrade (which is expensive) can be bought early enough in the game if you save enough to get it, however it is only useful in the near end of the campaign. -Very few enemy types and weapons.Overall it's not a bad game. Just lacking.			"

Some opening scene spoilers, probably. I needed a rant following this experience.It's not all bad, but I'd look elsewhere first.I bought this game in a £3 humble bundle with Battlefield 3 a number of years ago. I bought the bundle to buy BF3 cheap. This and the other games I received just sat in my library until now.Even though I had installed it prior to 2017, I had never played it beyond the introductory cutscene. This time, January/February 2017, I decided I would complete it from start to finish. This was also the first Crysis game I had ever played. I had no idea what to expect, aside from the catchphrase reverberating in my head: 'But will it run Crysis?'My first problem with the game: cutscenes. Of the first 35 minutes of playing the game, from the moment I started a new campaign, only 3 minutes had been dedicated to moving around and exploring to any meaningful extent. The player is met with a rollercoaster ride of pixellated then gorgeous cutscenes, the ugly ones obviously down to the game's console past.It's not that that the game isn't beautiful enough. I mean, my favourite games are Delta Force: Black Hawk Down (2003) and Final Fantasy 8 (1999) and both look like Meatloaf's butt when compared to Crysis 2. The problem is that the player has to sit through the opening cutscene, then they get to press W and move the mouse a bit to swim through and navigate the virtual underwater equivalent of a disappointing chutes and ladders children's playground. After that, the player sits through another cutscene, before they are finally allowed to navigate the world.And even then, the player isn't trusted to make his own way and discover how his tools work. Instead of making the player watch the tutorial, the tutorial could at least have been skippable and made obviously so with a 'Press Esc to Skip' message.My second problem was related to performance. This game was released in 2011. I built my PC in 2015. It has an i7, a GTX 980 and 16gb DDR4 RAM. Aside from Early Access ARK and ARMA 3, where I struggled to play the game at 50-60fps (yes, yes, 144Hz monitor), I have never struggled with any game thrown at this computer. Those first three minutes of actual gameplay as the super soldier with the nanosuit felt as though I was a turtle marching through a field of peanut butter. The framerate was stuck at 100 indoors, and outdoors it hovered around the 70 mark. Even for the acceptable framerate of 100, the movement wasn't fluid and it took a while to get used to the sub-par performance.After the first 35 minutes, the game starts to get better. Yes, the player does have to sit through more lengthy cutscenes and yes, the player does have to endure occasional idiotic AI and scripted events in the form of friendly NPCs explaining life-and-death-level important things in elevators while the player is bouncing up and down, desperate to get out and shoot things. And yes, there's the storyline. It exists. It's alright but very idiotic at times.After about an hour and a half of gameplay, I grew tired of the framerate and adjusted the settings, lowering everything to 'HIGH', keeping the resolution at 1080p and finally playing around with the settings in the Nvidia Control Panel. The game looked marginally worse, but the smooth 250fps plus framerate was worth it.With the smooth framerate, the gameplay was much more enjoyable. If you've played any first person shooter, well, ever, you'll feel at home here. You get to shoot things, you get to jump high and you get to hear a big man with a deep voice breathe the words ""cloak engaged"" down your neck every time you don't fancy fighting a bunch of enemies.Final mention: The music was very promising to begin with. The main menu and opening theme are evocative and very powerful, but from then on, unless you catch a bit of the pause menu music every now and again, the rest is rather forgettable.---I can't imagine anyone would buy Crysis 2 Maximum Edition on steam for £20 or so. Especially when you consider the fate of the Multiplayer.Is Crysis 2 worth £20? Probably not.Is Crysis 2 worth £3 on a sale? Considering you could buy the likes of Deus Ex: Human Revolution for the same amount... Probably not.Is Crysis 2 worth £3 if you've played all other Triple A titles under the sun? Try an indie game, or go outside in the fresh air and buy an ice cream.			"

												Well another story untold...That's the way it is game after game.  Game developers assume everyone plays for the blood and gore and not for anything else.I play for the story and the idea, that stuff they make all the cut scenes for, and I know I am not alone, but people know you can't get a game company to do anything but what's cheapest for them to do.  Stories require more work, more expense and are seen to be less profitable -- a short term view.  But, alas, I digress, for why should any gaming company be different than any other, right?  They should all be the same, have the same policy toward players, swap out PR people from one company to another, all use the same group of elitist beta and alpha testers, and, usually end up with them running the very forums they direct us to for support (Kinda explains why so many games are so identical in so many ways, and boring right?).  Yeah, game after game putting down ""corporate interests"" and ""greed"" done by company after company.... or more accurately ""corporation after corporation,"" whose entire interest IS greed.  Game companies are one of, if not generally, the highest profit margin available, 20% or more due to most of what they're selling being automated integrations, and those figures have only gone up since the company doesn't have to even produce a box, disc, or pay for shipping to some box store and is now a downloaded, entirely electronic product.So, yeah, recruit mode in Crysis 2 is too difficult for me.  I want to see the game world, to enjoy, and not be frustrated by, getting there.  I find little enjoyment in not being able to save the game when I want to save it, instead of relying on checkpoints that assure when I die to have to go through again what I was already sweating to go through the first time with 3 meleeing aliens on me at once, only to die to another one later due to their extended melee range compared to mine (to keep that blood and gore challenge assumption thing going).So I dedicate this review to all the silent gamers who spend money on games they uninstall a couple days later (as I am going to do with Crysis 2) and have resigned themselves to not being able to change the gaming industry and its assumptions about players that defines ""fun"" as one type of game play to the exclusion of all others.The solution for me with Crysis 2 is to be able to have a slider to adjust the aliens, both in hp and damage. from 150, or even 200% down to 20%, that are available to me through the options menu and irrespective of each category of player level I picked from recruit to veteran (sure I can set it at the beginning of the campaign and these are locked values for everything above recruit).  This way I can play the game with the level of challenge that keeps it fun for me, the player, the person who paid for the game, the person the game is supposed to be designed for, instead of resenting every penny I spent on this due to the frustration of trying to reach the next area and failling over and over.  If this happened by my own error, that's fine, but instead it's by a legitimized form of bullying, where game designers cater to that aspect of the game and its players but no other.As I am sure Crysis 2, nor any iteration above it, will ever have what I've suggested so we who want to pay to buy a story (like buying a book) can enjoy the game, I urge anyone else who loves the graphics, loves the stories of games, and wants to give those who went to the trouble to design them, to code them, to produce them, their due, not to buy Crysis 2.I'm hoping to get Crysis 1 working and that maybe its balance is different, however, I can see that in Crysis 2 I won't be getting passed the part where I have to escort the Marines.  Too many enemy aliens that take 5 shots each to take down (and often more than one head shot with a sniper rifle).  Too much shaking ground when using a sniper rifle.  Too much ""they know when you put the crosshairs on em"" when my suit doesn't have that innate feature and the aliens didn't have to kill me to earn being able to do that.  Though it is good to see that if I kill a boatload of them, and get to their bodies while fresh kills, I can enable that feature on my suit.  Yet my suit with its entirely inferior armor barely gets me through the first volley of 3 meleeing aliens.  Again, I am playing for the story, not harassment and to become intimately familiar with what it is like to be the scrawny new guy in the prison shower who dropped the soap.I've played computer games a long time (since the first mainfame text based Star Trek game that was coded in Fortran on punch cards), and have since picked games for the story not the elitism of epeenhood that appears to be the only thing game developers care about today (and mostly because it's cheap).To be sure Crysis 2 has great graphics, human AI could be better, story isn't too bad as far along as I am in it, but I'll never get to know the rest of the story due to being unable to go any further in the game.

												11年的显卡危机，11年与战地3同一级别的大作。就算拿到现在来说，孤岛危机2的画面依然很棒！当年，安上高清材质包，开启DX11的C2在画面上相比战地3毫不逊色，可能是战地3联机才是最主要的，联机模式战地3要比孤岛危机2好太多，但在单人剧情上战地3完败孤岛危机2，C2单人部分非常有诚意，关卡充实，不像战地3只有区区11关。此外，C2里面还有游戏数据统计，记录了你的命中率及爆头数等。C2还自带小短片及纳米服展示系统，没事儿也可以瞅瞅。说到游戏性，C2多样的玩法带给人极大的享受，你可以开启匿踪模式悄无声息的刀死敌人，也可以开启装甲模式拿上霰弹枪或重机枪与敌人肛，再或者拿把消音玩远距离爆头，一切都取决于你。C2的配乐及枪械音效也非常出色，背景音乐与整个游戏末世的基调契合。    唯一想吐槽的是孤岛危机2联机服务器居然关闭了，尽管C2联机很乏味，但也不能就直接关服啊，偶尔玩玩联机也是可以的。			"

												I really enjoyed this game, it was done very well. The graphics are superb, and it overall a very lifelike experience. As far as gameplay goes, the game changes as you move forward. The more dynamic style keeps things interesting for you. At first when you have no upgrades and such, it's more of a cover-based shooter. However, as the game moves on, mele combat becomes more of the way forward. A few missions later when you have more upgrades, you become more of a tank, and can just mow over a lot of the people (of course they are kind enough to give you a gigantic boss at that point). Moving to the end it turns in to a more stealth shooter. All of this keeps you interested, and it's really enjoyable all the way through. There isn't much of a story, everything that can go wrong, goes wrong; and every time something goes wrong, you have to battle more people. That's pretty standard, but the story isn't really the focus of the game, so it doesn't matter that much.TL;DR: It's awesome.			"

												Let me start off by saying this is an epic first person shooter game, possibly one of the best I ever played.Weapons are very well balanced and each have their own uses depending on your style. It also, like the original, has a great variety in the ways you can fight, either by stealth with cloak or by tanking through enemies with armor mode, the campaign is also a decent length, so you won't be beating it inside a couple of hours, though I could hardly see spending a total of 24 hours trying to beat the campaign. Regardless, the game excells in both gameplay and visuals, so even if you're one of those people who absolutely has to have that detail, this has it.Now for the question, ""does this game continue directly off of the first?"". No, it does not, at least not at first. Near the end the events that occurred between 1 and 2 are explained pretty well, so while you'll be left in the dark at first, you will get much more information later in the game. Which may feel like a drawback to some players, but I saw little issue with it, it did, if nothing else, make it feel more interesting to find out what happened.As for the story. While the game has a pretty thought-out story, it doesn't really have the kind of story that makes you wish it were a movie or novel out in the store for you to read or watch, nor does it really pull you in too much, it's interesting, and definitely action-packed, but if the game's strongest point were it's story, this game would very easily be near the bottom of the charts.For graphics. The visuals of the game are incredibly well done, you'll definitely need some good hardware to run this, but nonetheless it's quite nice looking. Maybe not to the level of games such as Bioshock Infinite, or the latest addition to the series, Crysis 3, but thats understandable as both of those games are newer, while this is a couple of years old. Now, back to the weapons, throughout the game you will find an Assault Rifle, Pistol, Submachine Gun, Sniper Rifle, Shotgun, Rocket Launcher, and multiple other, more powerful weapons that I won't spoil for anyone reading my little review/recommendation. None of them overpowers the other, unlike the original where the assault rifle was vastly more powerful and useful than any of the other guns.As for the multiplayer, this game has an incredibly fun multiplayer that is definitely worth playing. Sadly, and surprisingly in my opinion, there are very few players online, so finding a room will be tough, finding a room that doesn't have latency is also difficult. Not worth buying if you're only in it for the multiplayer, but only due to a lack of players.Now, finally, a last question; ""is the game better than the original?"". Yes, this game, in my opinion, is by FAR superior to the original, despite the lack of being able to roam through a massive island, everything else is vastly improved upon, with many new things to enjoy.Overall, I would give this game a 9/10, on gameplay, a 10/10, on story, a 6/10, on multiplayer, a 3/10, on graphics, a 9/10, and finally, on entertainment and replay value, definitely a 10/10.

												I really enjoyed this game, it was done very well. The graphics are superb, and it overall a very lifelike experience. As far as gameplay goes, the game changes as you move forward. The more dynamic style keeps things interesting for you. At first when you have no upgrades and such, it's more of a cover-based shooter. However, as the game moves on, mele combat becomes more of the way forward. A few missions later when you have more upgrades, you become more of a tank, and can just mow over a lot of the people (of course they are kind enough to give you a gigantic boss at that point). Moving to the end it turns in to a more stealth shooter. All of this keeps you interested, and it's really enjoyable all the way through. There isn't much of a story, everything that can go wrong, goes wrong; and every time something goes wrong, you have to battle more people. That's pretty standard, but the story isn't really the focus of the game, so it doesn't matter that much.TL;DR: It's awesome.			"

												Pros:+ Stunning visual design that runs smooth and beautiful even on mid-range hardware (Crytek knows how to make a pretty engine)+ Combat is fast-paced, exciting, and fun+ Variety of weapons and suit-based powers only add to the range of combat experiences and play-styles+ AI is solidCons:- Story-line is mediocre- Slight difficulty spikes- ""Open-world"" is more smoke and mirrors than actually sincere- Managing suit-powers, energy levels, and engaging in combat can feel a little hectic for the control schemeThe Bottom LineFor me Crysis is a lot like Halo. While I'm not all that heavily invested in the franchise I still somewhow find myself buying and playing the games and continuing to do so despite coming away from each one with an overwhelming ""meh"" experience.Crysis 2 is a lot of fun, I'll give it that, but its story-line and universe is one that feels more tired and generic rather than unique. Much like the Call of Duty series post-Modern Warfare, ""epic"" setpieces and scripted events just can't breathe any kind of actual life into the game or its story and so at the end of the day Crysis 2 is simply a great looking alien-killing frag-fest. A great looking time waster that will probably be a once-and-done experience.7 nanosuits out of 10			"

												11年的显卡危机，11年与战地3同一级别的大作。就算拿到现在来说，孤岛危机2的画面依然很棒！当年，安上高清材质包，开启DX11的C2在画面上相比战地3毫不逊色，可能是战地3联机才是最主要的，联机模式战地3要比孤岛危机2好太多，但在单人剧情上战地3完败孤岛危机2，C2单人部分非常有诚意，关卡充实，不像战地3只有区区11关。此外，C2里面还有游戏数据统计，记录了你的命中率及爆头数等。C2还自带小短片及纳米服展示系统，没事儿也可以瞅瞅。说到游戏性，C2多样的玩法带给人极大的享受，你可以开启匿踪模式悄无声息的刀死敌人，也可以开启装甲模式拿上霰弹枪或重机枪与敌人肛，再或者拿把消音玩远距离爆头，一切都取决于你。C2的配乐及枪械音效也非常出色，背景音乐与整个游戏末世的基调契合。    唯一想吐槽的是孤岛危机2联机服务器居然关闭了，尽管C2联机很乏味，但也不能就直接关服啊，偶尔玩玩联机也是可以的。			"

												Let me start off by saying this is an epic first person shooter game, possibly one of the best I ever played.Weapons are very well balanced and each have their own uses depending on your style. It also, like the original, has a great variety in the ways you can fight, either by stealth with cloak or by tanking through enemies with armor mode, the campaign is also a decent length, so you won't be beating it inside a couple of hours, though I could hardly see spending a total of 24 hours trying to beat the campaign. Regardless, the game excells in both gameplay and visuals, so even if you're one of those people who absolutely has to have that detail, this has it.Now for the question, ""does this game continue directly off of the first?"". No, it does not, at least not at first. Near the end the events that occurred between 1 and 2 are explained pretty well, so while you'll be left in the dark at first, you will get much more information later in the game. Which may feel like a drawback to some players, but I saw little issue with it, it did, if nothing else, make it feel more interesting to find out what happened.As for the story. While the game has a pretty thought-out story, it doesn't really have the kind of story that makes you wish it were a movie or novel out in the store for you to read or watch, nor does it really pull you in too much, it's interesting, and definitely action-packed, but if the game's strongest point were it's story, this game would very easily be near the bottom of the charts.For graphics. The visuals of the game are incredibly well done, you'll definitely need some good hardware to run this, but nonetheless it's quite nice looking. Maybe not to the level of games such as Bioshock Infinite, or the latest addition to the series, Crysis 3, but thats understandable as both of those games are newer, while this is a couple of years old. Now, back to the weapons, throughout the game you will find an Assault Rifle, Pistol, Submachine Gun, Sniper Rifle, Shotgun, Rocket Launcher, and multiple other, more powerful weapons that I won't spoil for anyone reading my little review/recommendation. None of them overpowers the other, unlike the original where the assault rifle was vastly more powerful and useful than any of the other guns.As for the multiplayer, this game has an incredibly fun multiplayer that is definitely worth playing. Sadly, and surprisingly in my opinion, there are very few players online, so finding a room will be tough, finding a room that doesn't have latency is also difficult. Not worth buying if you're only in it for the multiplayer, but only due to a lack of players.Now, finally, a last question; ""is the game better than the original?"". Yes, this game, in my opinion, is by FAR superior to the original, despite the lack of being able to roam through a massive island, everything else is vastly improved upon, with many new things to enjoy.Overall, I would give this game a 9/10, on gameplay, a 10/10, on story, a 6/10, on multiplayer, a 3/10, on graphics, a 9/10, and finally, on entertainment and replay value, definitely a 10/10.

												The plus side of this game, is that it's awesome. Graphics, sounds, action, and story are superb. I wish there was a little less action in places. It does get rather intense with full on action all the time. Not really a fully fledged grumble though coz I took breaks, and if you want to press on it's OK.There isn't much I can say that reviews haven't covered about the game, like it's in the city. I can add that it doesn't suffer for not being set in a lush tropical paradise. The graphics are handled superbly. I pondered about lots looking around and taking in scenery, often crouching to look at even the ground. I loved all the different coloured rocks and pebbles they put in streams, that exist in real life. It's still a real vacation experience. I have seen the odd complaint that it's possible to get through with little combat, and using stealth. Really though, why buy a shooter if you not going to fire your guns. The shooting action is epic too. You can go toe to toe with one standard enemy ground troop as you have better armour and better firepower. I read criticism of the new nano-suit, and I think this is unfounded. It's much smoother to access. Maximum armour actually does something. With upgrades you add on during the game, it gets better.All in all, a blockbuster from start to finish. Just maybe it could do with a little rest of easier gameplay once in a while.			"

												This game is overall, a very fun experience. The storymode/campaign is absolutely AMAZING. For a extremely linear and restricted story, the options available for any simple combat task are always entertining. You can snipe off enemies, you can sneak around them, or you can put on your armor and blast your way through them. The combat system is a bit simple minded,  but it is beautifully balanced and you never feel ""OP"". The story is basic, but it is still pretty freakin cool. The only bad thing I can say about the campaign is its limited feel. Its short and restricted, but still one of the most fun 3 to 8 hours you can spend. The multiplayer is pretty generic and seems like a second thought, but its pretty fun all the same. And lastly, the graphics. Even  on absolute minimum settings, this game absolutey DESTROYS any call of duty game graphics wise, still. The games that can hope to compete with these beautiful, sumptuous visuals are few and far between. I love this game, but get it on sale. 8.5/10			"

												The release of Crysis 2 was a mess on the PC. It was an obvious console port and the options had been maximum limited. This game was obviously meant to make console gamers crap their pants with Cryteks graphical technology. They had already made PC players crap their pants from Crysis 1 so now it was the console gamers turn. In this case the cryengine 3 got way more limited than cryengine 2. Which means worse graphics, less dynamic stuff and less destructible environments. Put Cryengine 2 on a console and it would blow up, so crytek had to tweak the engine to be less productive but still look great. This is a huge disappointment for PC players. Lets just face the fact, Crysis only got famous for its incredible graphics! Thats the main reason people bought it.The game itself is so linear and scripted its like youre playing a theater. You stand there on the stage looking like a fool while everybody around you (on the same stage) jump around and do their stuff from their manuscript and push you aside everytime you stand in their way. Thats how the whole game felt for me. You do your shooting in the most linear corridors and areas until you come to the next scripted event. You cant shoot, you cant talk, the game waits for you until you stand in the exact spot it want you to stand so it can continue. And the story is so abysmal i didnt even know the purpose of the whole thing. It felt like i was playing a cod campaign. Its just there for a reason so you can shoot stuff. And yeah it felt like a cod game with nanosuits. I played through the entire game just to see if at least the ending was any good but no i was wrong. No huge bossbattle just another scripted event with ""push that button or you die"". Man these developers have to realise that not everything cod does is good. Make something of your own for fick sake!I cant recommend this game to anyone except people who like to shoot alot.			"

												Graphics in this game are really good, based on the fact that it's a 4 year old game. However, the gameplay is not engaging  enough. You have only a handful of guns to choose from, only 2 active suit abilities, almost non-existent upgrade system, with only 1 or 2 useful perks to your suit and only a few aliens to shoot  at. I look at this game more like a showcase of cryengine 3. Story is decent, but once you've seen it once there isn't much going for this game.			"

												So, I would be playing this game right now if the developers posessed a single brain cell. After playing this game for around a month, EA decided to shove the worlds biggest♥♥♥♥♥♥so deep into their♥♥♥♥♥they could taste♥♥♥♥♥♥in their mouth. I now cannot access MY OWN GAME which I PAYED FOR because of developers which cannot design a game menu. Upon opening the game, I am presented with a login screen - seems perfectly ok, right? We no, its not right. I would take great pleasure in recieving a response from EA about why you need to login to your own game even though YOU ALREADY GAVE THEM $30. So anyway, I login using my credentials only to find that although I made my ""MyCrysis"" account the best part of ten seconds ago, ""My password is incorrect"". I promise you I did not ♥♥♥♥ up the password (Yes, I did not have caps lock on) so please explain to me how, despite my entering all the passwords I have used in my life, they are all incorrect. I read the whole login screen and realized that there was a password reset button, PERFECT! Well, it would be if it, you know, worked. After around 10 minutes of searching the website, I finally concluded that there is no way of resetting your password.Thanks ♥♥♥♥wits.-10/10			"

												Thanks to EA and Crytek this will probably be the last PC game I have bought. I was playing nicely with modern hardware. After i only one time used alt + tab to enter windows desktop i'm now stuck with the so called fps/v sync bug playing full screen. I can't easily seem to fix it. The game was running very smooth at first but after alt + tabbing the game now it runs crappy in full screen. FPS is still smooth running in window mode.Also the game just crashed on me. I'm done with this kind of PC gaming. Hopefully my next game will be a Zelda on a Wii. I hardly had any problems playing Nintendo games in the past.This way of programming PC games is just a waste of your money.			"

												Impressions & Score: Story: 9.5 out of 10The story in part II of Crysis has improved by a lot, although you do have a feeling that's copying Half-Life 2 on some aspects. There is a lot of work put into this new story, videos before every mission, information about characters and enemies, in-game cutscenes etc., most of the work is of good quality and there are some surprises throught the story, but not many. I liked how the aliens have been changed but at the same time I would have prefered to see a mix of old aliens and new ones, so that there's a logic why they changed aspect (they upgraded some of their units, etc.) otherwise you'll have the impression that there aren't the same as those from Crysis I, even though the story tries to tell you that they are. There are many captivating moments throught the story and I like the fact that it isn't too predictable, meaning that you won't know what will happen exactly. The end leaves room for many sequels to come, so be ready to continue buying Crysis.Graphics: 10 out of 10Crysis 2 continues it's legacy of excellent graphics that it started in 2007, improving on every aspect. The lights, weapon effects, character design, environments are all top notch, the only thing I'm dissapointed is the fact that they removed vehicule interiors, which were not only great in the first Crysis but gave more realism to the game. There are some bad graphics on certain objects, but you'll ignore them easily  when you evaluate the whole game. Crysis 2 graphics still manage to impress me and I'm playing this game in 2015, so that's why I gave it the maximum score.Gameplay: 8 out of 10Gameplay is great, many features added (ledge grab, power kick, combined nano powers etc.) but other were removed (vehicule interiors - which would have been great on the streets of New York, no flight vehicules, no boats, no tanks, no freezing effect etc.). Some removed features, I can understand, others not, since they would have made the gameplay better. Also, I've mentioned earlier the bug with some spawn locations, which can remove some realism from the game.  The good thing is that some of the features added work very well, in the ruined New York environment. Many players complained for the fact that the game became too linear, you don't have the freedom to roam around on huge map like in Crysis 1, but I understand the producers for making the game more linear, since many of the cool effects (buildings, bridges falling etc.) wouldn't have been possible on a  free-roam map, also the level of details wouldn't have been the same. Overall the gameplay is quite cool when combined with the great story.Audio: 10 out of 10The music in Crysis 2 is just awesome, especially the music in the menu, the other sound effects are also of high quality. How can I give it less than 10 when sometimes I was starting the game just to listen the music, I wasn't even playing. AI Behavior: 8.5 out of 10The AI is quite good, not awesome, but it handles itself pretty well. I've played the game on the max difficulty (Post-Human Warrior) and I didn't find the game too hard, the AI shoots very well but if you use corectly the nanosuit powers, you'll manage to finish each mission after just a few tries (you'll need a few, since the enemies are unpredictable).  The Human AI soldiers will try to flank you and use grenades, while the Aliens AI will jump on you, deactivate your suit and even cloak (at end of the game). The bad part is that sometimes the AI acts stupid, for example you kill an enemy AI on cloak right in front of his friends and they don't react at all, like nothing happened. Also sometimes the AI gets stucked behind certain boxes or in certain areas. Over 75 % of my kills were stealth kills (mostly with the knife), actually if you play on the max difficulty, most of your kills will be stealth also, since the enemy can kill you easily even with armor mode on. Still even after those bugs, the AI is quite good and dynamic, for which it deserves a good score.Multiplayer: not testedI've played this game during a month that I had no internet at all, so I couldn't actually test anything that involved multiplayer. But I've red that the suits powers are diminished considerably, in order to be able to kill other players faster, and not wander around in a stalemate. I'm not a multiplayer gamer, so I mostly prefer single-player campaigns, but I think that Crysis 2 would have deserved at least an 8 or a 9 for the multiplayer (mostly because of many removed features).Overall: 9.2 out 10The new Crysis 2, really improves on everything that the last one did except gameplay. I didn't gave the maximum score because I didn't liked the fact that they removed a lot of cool stuff from the previous Crysis, like a lot of vehicules and boats and other things. But even after this Crysis 2 definitely is worth the money, the story is very well done for a shooter, you'll spend many hours of good gameplay, the environments are awesome, the aliens are great, the audio is cool, what more can I say. I bought the game on a sale for less than 4 EUR, but if you don't want to wait for a sale, go and buy it right away cause it deserves full price.PS: Enemies in Crysis do have the same amount of health and deal the same amount of damage regardless of difficulty. Difficulty only affects their A.I.; i.e. reaction time, awareness, accuracy, and duration of burst fire.On the highest difficulty setting(Post-Human Warrior there's no split-second invincibility after you're hit, allowing you to be damaged by each consecutive bullet in a spray of automatic fire. As a result, you die a LOT faster against automatic fire when not in Armor Mode. In Armor Mode, however, your durability seems pretty much the same. Source: gamefaqs.com/Crysis 2 Weapons-Enemies GuideImportant: After finishing the game I only got 12 out 13 weapons attachments, which gave me a 99.76 % completion. I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't get 100 % completion and started to look online for tips. I found out that you actually cannot get the 13 weapons attachments because of a bug (they decided that ironsights isn't an attachment, but then they forget to update the list to contain 12 not 13) that the producers forgot to remove, so at least try to get at least 12 if you want to have the game completed 100 %.  	Obs: The only thing I dislike about the new Crysis 2 is the enemy predefined spawn locations, which are really annoying at first and predictable after that. Example: I have to destroy a fuel supply, after the fuel supply explodes, enemies start to spawn in predefined locations (some spawns are good, those when the enemy comes from outside the map, others are just awfull, like when the enemy spawn right in front of you, this removes some part of realism from the game). By the way, the AI is great, not very smart but dynamic, which makes every encounter different. "

												I’ve already completed Crysis 2 on PS3, both online and offline. But now that I have it on Steam, I can get the “full” experience.The Cry Engine 3 delivers a very high standard in terms of visual quality. Even the gameplay is varied and has options regarding how you want to play. The real let down in Crysis 2 is the lack of enemy types. You’re either fighting C.E.L.L. grunts or Alien Seph grunts and there’s not much difference between them. I was really hoping for some seriously diverse enemy types. I also found the game too easy. There are only a few points that you’re forced into fighting enemies. The rest of the time you can just cloak through the game with no sweat on “Post Human Warrior” difficulty lol. There are elements of greatness throughout Crysis 2, but when I was expecting the best of the best, this was a bittersweet experience.An interesting game, but a let down if you’re expecting a bigger and better sequel to Crysis.

												Another great entry in the Crysis series.  It loses something due to not being in a jungle environment like the first one; since this is in a city, there's no more hiding in bushes.  However, there's still some great stealth gameplay.  The aliens are an improvement over the ones from Crysis 1, the controls have been streamlined, and the AI continues to be fairly competent.			"

Posted: November 17, 2014
												Basically a Call of Duty type game.  Blasting your way from inconsequential mission to another.  Not sure what the whole story is about as it didn't seem to matter.  I give it a ""Yes"" mostly because of the graphics, they were great.  I have good PC system so I like games that are made with really good graphics. I know lot of gamers say it’s the gameplay not the graphics that count, but I would disagree.  Its the same reason we go to see action movies like Avatar, Batman, Ironman, Spiderman, Captain America etc.  Those are all cartoon stories, with silly plots and even sillier characters if you think about it.  You go to these movies for only one reason; the mind blowing special effects. When you hear that an action movie cost around 150-200 million to make you know that you are in for a visual treat.Back to the game; another thing I liked about this fairly liner shooter is that you could fight the battles coming at it from different angles.  When you got killed, the approach to enter the battle was always the same, but you could try different tactics, i.e., gun your way through, hit and run, or hide and wait till they came to you.  I found that in most other linear shooters that if you didn't follow the strict ""run and shoot"" Call of Duty style that there was little other options.  Generally in other game I've played, you have to hit a certain point for the enemy to fight you and if you hide or try stealth, nothing happens till you come of hiding face them full on.  Often the game forces you into the open by one method or another such as lobbing grenades thrown by invisible enemies just to keep you in the open.  In this game I did a lot of hiding forcing them to look for me which actually worked very well and broke up the monotony of the constant skirmishes.  Actually I did a lot of hiding because I was always busy admiring the incredible rendering of buildings and the cityscape.  The detail was phenomenal.  I couldn't get enough of it.As for the Nano suit gimmick, half the time I forgot to turn it on.  It was nice to have those abilities of armour and stealth, when I remembered to use them.  There were lots of different weapons to choose from, although I generally like to choose a set of weapons and stick with them if I can throughout the game.  As for the shooting mechanics, I find that all FPS suffer from the same limitation; a sometimes inconsistency in weapon damage.   The same weapon can kill an enemy with a few shots or next time you use it need to empty the clip to do the same damage.   Fortunately this incosistancy was no different from any other game.The plot was confusing and to me didn't really matter.  The only game I ever played a game that had a decent plot was Metro 2033 and that's because it was based on the Russian novel of the same name.   That game followed that novel’s plot reasonably close so the story and game were much closer intertwined.  As for Crysis 2 you are being directed by one character or another and didn't really matter because regardless of the mission by the time you got close there was always one of those ""by the way, I forgot to tell you this"" scenario that stretched the game out.  For all I cared about the missions they could have been asking me to pick up a quart of milk at the 7-11 while I was on my way to whatever destination I was heading for.  As matter of fact it was kind of like that, sort of like ""Hey Alcatraz, before you get here can you picked a quart of milk from 7-11"".   Then when you got close it was like ""Oh, sorry I forgot to tell there are some bullies hanging around the 7-11 that are going to try and take your money so you're gonna have to fight your way through them to get to the 7-11.""In conclusion, even though the plot was meandering and gun play was getting very repetitious, it still allowed you explore different ways to attack and still get your objective done.  Of course as mentioned the graphics are amazing.  If you really take the time to look at all graphics you'll see that they spent a lot of money and time on this aspect of the game.  I wouldn't have been satisfied if I paid full price for this game but I got it on a Steam sale for around $10.00 and it was well worth the $10.00.			"

												I enjoyed Far Cry 1 and 2 despite all of their flaws. Crysis 1 had its good moments.Despite two earnest attempts to finish this sequel, the sheer boredom of shooting hundreds of clones of the same two enemy architypes inside of linear corridors has worn thin. The story is an after thought and the characters are a textbook example of how not to write video game characters, which would be fine if the game wasn't vigorously peppered with forced cutscenes and dialogue and scripted sequences that bring the spotlight on the weakest parts of the franchise.

												First of all this is kind of a pointless to review such a game which is critically acclaimed by everyone (literally) and secondly, I have completed the game pretty late - considering the time of release of the game.But these being said, I feel that I should put my thoughts for this awe-inspiring game at least once.So, I have broken down my thought or review(so to speak) in sections -Story: The plot is very thick - though it may not have the emotional content that we can find in the popular CoD series of games. But still the plot compels  the player to stick to the game and hear out the different chatters between the NPCs. The link up with the 1st installment of this series is very smooth and ""now it all make sense"". Still I would have loved to have at-least a couple of side missions / sub-plots in the game (specially when these days when FPS leverage some of the RPG elements).Gameplay: Very smooth indeed; the keyboard configuration is very nice and also be dragged to the multiplayer games without changing much -  in fact I played the multiplayer with default keyboard and mouse config. The movements are very nice and the transitions between nano suit modes are seamless. You could just put on some strength just before shooting your sniper rifle and then just after the shot switch to cloak without any difficulty. Cut Scenes are very nicely played and well placedGraphics : well when you are talking about a game that uses Cry Engine 3 ""Graphics"" is the most spectacular feature that you wish to review. in words - STUNNING!! I have made a few in game snaps that I wish to keep forever. the horizon and the urban landscapes are too good and the NY city is realistically portrayed here. Since I used a bit older GTX 570 to play the game- I had to reduce a bit of the quality in order to get an optimum performance. Still, boy oh boy , you will feel that a new world is coming alive in front of your eyes.Multiplay - well the MP is really really good (once you get used to the pace and skills) and I earned a few badges there. Unfortunately I had to stop the MP cause it was interfering with my CS 1.6 skills (whatever I have left of it) cause their game mechanics are completely different..So in shorter words - I really liked that game - so much, that I played the campaign in 2 different difficulty modes. If you are looking for some FPS with gripping story and stunning graphics with smooth gameplay then be sure that you have this game in your library.And thanks to steam that I got it in much cheaper rate.- Maximum Game -			"

												Just saying, DON'T get this game without playing the first one.Besides, this game is actually worse than the first Crysis in my opinion, i would recommend  the first game, but i would have to say, skip this. I would only play this for the story, the gameplay in my opinion, really sucks in comparison to the first game, it's a big downgrade.5.5/10			"

												Better than its predecessor and certainly more compatible with Windows 8 and 64 bit systems, Crysis 2 is proof that a game can never be too finished. The new functions of the HUD, namely the ability to tag objects, use thermal vision and navigate the environment in more inventive ways than before, all add a great new dimension to the Crysis universe. The setting of New York is very well recreated. The crisis of the aliens invasion is masterfully plotted and the introduction in which you and your squad members have to swim to saftey, only to be rendered unconscious by an unknown enemy, sets the stage for a compelling adventure. The  weapons are as modern, diverse and advanced as ever. They make you think that all soldiers of the future should adopt them. The AI is no pushover and will give you a run for your money. The physics of the various impacts are well researched, impressive and fun to see. You will find at least a handful of ways to take the enemy on and have a good laugh.Crytek  created a great followup in the form of Crysis 2. The extras also add extra replayability, so, if you have the means and love Crytek games, get this one. You won't be disappointed.			"

Also comes with alright multiplayer Word to the wise: do not attempt to run this game without fairly beefy hardware. You will damage your system (video card to be specific) if you don't.			"

												Even though an untimely computer crash caused me not to be able to continue finishing the story mode, I have compiled a few thoughts about Crysis 2.This game is pretty. Crytek went to the pretty store, bought everything in it, sprinkled extra pretty on top, then put it on sale. The best word in the arsenal of the english language to discribe the graphics isstunning.Even with my admitedly aging PC rig, I managed to have a very consistent, and enjoyable single player experience at 1080p resolution.  If I had a kidney to spare, I'd sell it for a PC that can run this game in all of its visual splendor, yet with my also admitedly meager funds and some careful configuring, found the PC version more satisfying than the xbox 360's.The story and the in-game dialogue are a vast improvement over the first one, and the game itself sticks to tried and true FPS gameplay mechanics, without becoming tiresome. I was thoughly entertained from start to finish, and for the price of admission, hard to beat.I reccomend this game with a 3/5,and 3.5/5 on sale.			"

												I've put this game aside for now only because of saves. Any game, particularly on PC should allow you to save at any moment in your progress. Crysis 2, however, takes you back to your last check point. This increasing trend is extremely frustrating at times, and in Crysis 2 - where you can spend a significant amount of time getting past enemies - it is even moreso. Perhaps when I'm done clearing my massive backlog, I'll come back to it. But at this point in my life I'm more interested in quality time and a good story, than a game that intends on penalizing me with time loss thanks to the lack of a simple save function. The story, is however, solid, and the graphics are beautiful. I'm somewhat disappointed by the lack of open world features, at least in comparison to the first Crysis, but it's understandable. Before it came out, I pictured being able to go into any building, or at least most buildings around you and exploring every location I could get into. That was a little unrealistic, I'll admit. Particularly when it was also a game designed with consoles in mind. I recommend it, if you're looking for a good time waster.			"

												I enjoyed Far Cry 1 and 2 despite all of their flaws. Crysis 1 had its good moments.Despite two earnest attempts to finish this sequel, the sheer boredom of shooting hundreds of clones of the same two enemy architypes inside of linear corridors has worn thin. The story is an after thought and the characters are a textbook example of how not to write video game characters, which would be fine if the game wasn't vigorously peppered with forced cutscenes and dialogue and scripted sequences that bring the spotlight on the weakest parts of the franchise.

The extras also add extra replayability, so, if you have the means and love Crytek games, get this one. You won't be disappointed.			"

												Thanks to EA and Crytek this will probably be the last PC game I have bought. I was playing nicely with modern hardware. After i only one time used alt + tab to enter windows desktop i'm now stuck with the so called fps/v sync bug playing full screen. I can't easily seem to fix it. The game was running very smooth at first but after alt + tabbing the game now it runs crappy in full screen. FPS is still smooth running in window mode.Also the game just crashed on me. I'm done with this kind of PC gaming. Hopefully my next game will be a Zelda on a Wii. I hardly had any problems playing Nintendo games in the past.This way of programming PC games is just a waste of your money.			"

												Graphics in this game are really good, based on the fact that it's a 4 year old game. However, the gameplay is not engaging  enough. You have only a handful of guns to choose from, only 2 active suit abilities, almost non-existent upgrade system, with only 1 or 2 useful perks to your suit and only a few aliens to shoot  at. I look at this game more like a showcase of cryengine 3. Story is decent, but once you've seen it once there isn't much going for this game.			"

												When I started playing this game, I was enthralled. The first several levels are on par with games like Half-Life 2 and Bioshock, evoking a real sense of wonder and exploration. As you begin to explore, you slowly learn about what's going on. The game does a really good job keeping the tension at the start--the pacing is great. The basic premise is very generic, but it seems like a pretty interesting version at first. The experience of wandering the beseiged NYC alone looking for answers as an unlikely hero forced into an inhuman monster was great. I had to keep playing just to see what would happen next.Unfortunately, the plot quickly falls apart. After a few hours, all the mystery is lost, and it devolves into yet another ""Heroic U.S. Military vs. Fictional Bad Guys"" kind of game. You get shackled to some idiotic squadmates, and it's no longer about exploration and discovery, it's about following the orders that get shouted at you. Not a satisfying experience for me.Also, as I got further into the game, it started crashing more and more. I think I'm about 3/4 of the way through it, but every time I play, it crashes within an hour. And when i say ""crash,"" I mean it freezes, messes up my video card drivers, quits big picture, and I have to♥♥♥♥♥♥around with ctrl-alt-delete for several minutes just to get back to normal. At this point, it's not worth the effort. Other Pros and Cons:+Controls are perfect+Graphics are quite impressive (mostly I was impressed that my computer could handle it)+Immersive (at first)+Good gun feel+It's fun watching New York get more and more ♥♥♥♥ed up over the course of the game+Gun customization is good+Nanosuit powers are cool+""Tactical options"" are a nice addition+You can see your own legs+Some voice acting is pretty good-Most voice acting is pretty bad-Why even bother carrying bullets when you can kill anything with a couple of punches?-AI sucks-Stealth sucks (the enemies always know exactly where you are, and will start shooting immediately when you decloak)-Long loading times-Glitches			"

												This is a console port.  I loved Crysis and Crysis Warhead, but this was like biting into a piece of poop.Crysis and Crysis Warhead put you into deceptively open environments.  It was linear, but allowed you freedom.  This was done fantastically.  You could run and jump around, and come at tasks from different angles and accomplish them in different ways.  You were changing armor modes and doing fun stuff the entire game.  Sneaking in, sneaking out.  Running in, grabbing a guy, running out, then throwing him off a cliff.  Sneaking in, taking over a machine gun, then switching to armor mode and using the gun.  There was flanking, stealth, open environments, vehicles, etc etc etc.  It was a truely great FPS.Crysis 2 is Crysis 1 with dumbed down graphics, dumbed down armor (you just use armor mode the entire game), infinite ammunition, no free roam environments, never an enemy 50 yards away, full body hitboxes (no headshots), stupid-as-♥♥♥♥ story line, and was clearly just a money grab.  It's like they took Crysis and said ""Hey, how can we make the sequel the same as Call of Duty, but with the hitboxes of an RPG?""There are no decisions to be made.  You just trudge forward, blazing your gun the entire time in armor mode.  Enemies spawn like a Gauntlet game.  You kill one, and another identical one just pops out from the same location.  Each area has 5-20 guys that you kill like this.  The enemies aren't human, they're robots.  Because they explain that the aliens are all wearing suits like yours now.  So every fight is blasting into the enemy 50 or so times until it dies and is immediately replaced by its clone.Also, the AI got worse.  The enemy never works as a team.  I find it strange that they did this.  Maybe XBOX's processor couldn't handle the old AI?  I don't know.			"

It's like they took Crysis and said ""Hey, how can we make the sequel the same as Call of Duty, but with the hitboxes of an RPG?""There are no decisions to be made.  You just trudge forward, blazing your gun the entire time in armor mode.  Enemies spawn like a Gauntlet game.  You kill one, and another identical one just pops out from the same location.  Each area has 5-20 guys that you kill like this.  The enemies aren't human, they're robots.  Because they explain that the aliens are all wearing suits like yours now.  So every fight is blasting into the enemy 50 or so times until it dies and is immediately replaced by its clone.Also, the AI got worse.  The enemy never works as a team.  I find it strange that they did this.  Maybe XBOX's processor couldn't handle the old AI?  I don't know.			"

												For those looking into Crysis 2,play Crysis 1,this one is for those that care for the story of Crysis and even if you do,theres not much to gain here.In short you are given a powerful suit that has a power limit but can be made into a bioweapon that can kill aliens(because smashing them and shooting them isn`t as effective).Also the last owner shoots himself because reasons.So your to do list:1.Kill Cell troops(typical soldiers)because they want you,well not you,the suit.2.Find a guy in a city that is being attacked by squidwards with guns and by a disease made by said squidwards.3.You kill squidward like aliens with guns because ♥♥♥♥`em.4.You help US soldiers protect their stuff.5.You stop helping them because you need to kill some peeps(Cell troops)6.Very interesting story part with aliens.Don't play this if you are not a fan of generic fps shooting with invis or more health powers, linear story or linear fighting/stealth sections(you choose if you want to do it loud or silent but nothing changes in the story or other sections).Play Crysis 1.P.s Some typos.

												This game could've been so good. It could've gave the player a feeling of being a predator in the city jungle. Hunting it's prey down with the help of an awesome power suit that allows the wearer to move around unseen or even go into open combat to prove who can outlast the other with the help of the suits maximum armour. But no of course not. You feel more like a little ♥♥♥♥♥ who can't take much even in maximum armour. Or feeling like the invisible predator that hunts it's prey down? No. Your stealth is so short (even with the stealth and power upgrades) you'll stealth to kill one enemy then go behind a ♥♥♥♥ing wall to wait for your suit to recharge and then do that over and over. But wait the stealth system is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sometimes you could be standing in front of the enemy pop in and out of cloak and they seem to ♥♥♥♥ing stare at you like don't exist. What else is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about the stealth? The silencers for the guns. Here's how the silencer works for this game. If you shoot an enemy in the head with a silenced weapon and they die? Good job the enemy will not notice that. But if you attempt to shoot but miss with a silenced weapon? SUDDENLY THE ENTIRE ENEMY FORCE KNOWS YOUR EXACT LOCATION AND FLOCK TO YOUR♥♥♥♥♥AS IF A NEON SIGN WAS PLANTED ON TOP OF YOUR ♥♥♥♥ING HEAD. Small note about the AI for this game. I think they recycled similar coding from Crysis 1 for this game as well. Another thing that is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about this game is that the aliens a bunch of bullet/rocket/grenade/c4-sponge♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that soak up all your ammo. It ends up feeling like military in Crysis 2 give their soldiers ♥♥♥♥ing BB guns to fight the alien invasion. I had to use at least 5 ♥♥♥♥ing rockets to bring down the walker-type alien. Don't have rockets? Why don't you try walking up to it using your other explosives? Yeah you'll be ripped to shreds because your suit energy gets depleted by one of it's moves, basically rendering you dead.Also talking about the suit. Can someone tell me why a futuristic suit designed to for any situation. Doesn't have simple functions like I don't know A FLASH LIGHT or SIMPLE NIGHT VISION. Yeah that vision used to see in the dark in the game? IT'S CALLED HEAT VISION. Why the ♥♥♥♥ am I using it to see in the dark? Also when you run it uses up the suits energy. Sure that would've been alright if my running speed wasn't so ♥♥♥♥ing slow. I'm pretty sure the speed mode in Crysis 1 was at least 3 times faster than this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Speaking of energy usage. Did you know if you throw a flat pc monitor with ""full force"" using ALL the suits energy. It is thrown literally 2 metres away. WHAT KIND OF SUIT IS THIS? It allows me to tote a mounted machine gun around using ZERO energy but if I am to throw a small monitor 2 metres away I use ALL of the suits energy. A lot of things in this game can completely 100 to 0 your suit energy really easily. Things such as taking 1 rocket to the face but here's the catch that 1 rocket basically cuts through all your suit energy AND 99% of your health too so if an enemy just farts in my general direction I die. What else? If you want to break down a metal door = 100% energy. Even though you can clearly just break metal door bar with ease in a cutscene in right at the beginning of the game. Why can't he just ♥♥♥♥ing do that to all the doors? Break door handle, open door simple♥♥♥♥♥♥ Falling literally 8 metres with armour mode on = 100% energy. So you could imagine how long armour mode lasts in an actual fight.When I bought the game and looked at reviews online I really had high hopes for this game. I really didn't think it had so many horrible design decisions. That really disappointed me. I really wanted to look past these points but they just broke my immersion and my mind. Like seriously I think I can throw a flat screen monitor further without the suit and the door thing? I think can get through those doors with less effort without the suit.TL;DR Broke my immersion and expectations.			"

												*Sigh* What a disappointment. Let's keep this to the points. Crysis 2 is a bad game. Crysis 1 and Warhead are better and worth spending on. Why is Crysis 1 / Warhead better? Well, because it has the following:A semi-large open sandbox environment.Being able to go Prone (snake belly on the floor shuffle).Better control over Nanosuit abilities (able to activate strength mode, speed mode at will rather having it on by default)More ability to be stealthy and favour a silent approach.A whooole newww worllllld... a fantaaastic poiiiint of viiiiewwww. It was a new experience.Crysis 2 shoves you down a corridoor shooter under the pretense of being an open world sandbox environment. You are tricked into thinking it is, but it's not. It's a lie. The game features stupid setpieces, fixed cutscenes that no one cares about, a storyline as farfetched and uninteresting as it can be and a linear progression which renders you bored and tired.Yes, the visuals are amazing but the whole game experience is such a farce that I don't think it's worth you sitting through the whole title. Go play Crysis 1 and Warhead (expansion). Those are brilliant games. Very enjoyable. VERY. Avoid Crysis 2. Please. Crysis 3 is even worse than Crysis 2. Crytek don't know how to make games. Just expensive tech demos and benchmark tools which take up 20GB of your HDD / SDD and give you nothing in return but railroad boredom. "

												This game Improved many things over Crysis. + Upgraded Energy System and Suit.     o Ability to Cloak while running fast with Speed, and Jumping High with Power.     o (Contiued from last one) Combinding Suit Abilities helps out get through some areas / speed past them. + Ability to upgrade parts of the suit was also very nice. + Campaign wasn't super long, but at least it wasn't shorter than 5 hours. + Decent amount of guns to choose from, although i stuck with 3 in general. A few things i didn't like:- Cutscenes aren't skipable, which is annoying, mostly on 2nd and 3rd playthroughs.- You uncloak if you go for a Stealth Kill, which shouldn't happen (at least in Campaign).- Sometimes, enemies can see you even while you're cloaked and you're not by them.But overwall, it was a good game.

I've played them all and tried to see, at least, something original, there isn't.I'm really sorry for that, but it has as much mature content as a Happy Meal.Don't buy it for full price, only as a major bargain sale deal.

												the premise had potential but the execution is a failure. the enemies swarm and kill you much faster than you can kill them if you attack head on. you'd think this would indicate that stealth is the way to go but the only real stealth functionality is the very very brief period of invisibility on the suit, which is lessened even more when doing even something as simple as walking.everything you do drains the suit energy; invisibility, jumping, running, shooting.  makes for far too much downtime waiting for the recharge.

This feels too linear, like a corridor shooter with pretty graphics and scenery and could have been much more open with the decisions, like the original Crysis. The size of the original game allowed for more decisions. Also, unless you have a mid-range rig or better, steer clear, not even low resolutions and graphics options will save you.			"

												My first thought was ""Crysis of Duty"". It's a decent game, but it's not what should have followed the first game. The graphics are toned down, the destructible environments have been done away with, the story is tangential to what was presented in Crysis, and the power system felt hampered compared to the original even though it's presented as an upgrade. The player-character feels like he's lumbering around, and it's nothing like the swift, silent, deadly special-forces feel you get from the original. In short, it's just not as good and this game has taken a direction towards becoming just another generic ""Big Budget Shooter"".			"

												I bought this game because I am a fanatic when it comes to stealth games. This game is more of a corridor shooter than a stealth game. It is much easier to just enable armor and kill everyone that way than it it to take a stealth approach.Although by the end of the game I was just skipping entire sections in stealth because the game becomes rather dull.The story is quite cliche. Nothing you haven't seen before and to be honest no character to care about. Some scenes were set up nicely. Overall I found the game to be quite bland.			"

												A wonderful masterpiece that is well worth your time. Crysis 2 is a game that is a worthy successor to the massively acclaimed Crysis. With masterful graphics, and revamped gameplay, Crysis 2 is a work of art all on its own. With the included threat of the Ceph, the pesky Koreans from the last Crysis seem like baby toys, with high tech weaponry and deadly technology, you feel like you are a god among men when you are mowing these aliens down. But one of the largest changes that impressed me is how the nanosuit interface has changed. Crysis 2 has made the usage of the nanosuit a lot more user friendly, so instead of having to use your mouse wheel to select certain armor abilities in Crysis, you press key binds to use them, and in some cases they are used on their own without having to activate it. Like instead of selecting sprint to run super-fast, now regular sprint does that automatically for you, and to use your enhanced jumping, you just hold space instead of switching to strength then jumping. It makes the suit a lot more functional and easier to use. With an excellent story to continue the originally Crysis. I don’t feel it is worth the $30 price tag, but if you can find it on sale, this game is a wonderful game. Just make sure to play the original Crysis first, because a lot of the background story in the first in necessary to understand the story in Crysis 2.			"

												If you're someone who liked the open world of Farcry or Crysis, this is not the game for you. Prepare for linear level design, dumbed dumb easymode level design, and 10%+ of your time in unskippable cut scenes. If it weren't for all the blood, you'd think this game was designed for an 8 year old. Unbearable drudgery. "

												I loved the first Crysis but was rather disappointed with this one.  I didn't mind the plot and found the combat to be pretty fun, but the lack of a quick save feature really killed it for me.  I enjoy playing games on a really high difficulty, but the checkpoints in this one save the game *before* you find new guns, so if find something new that you'll want--and you will--you'll end up having to pick up and modify your kit every time you die.This game also suffers from consolitis in other regards, as well, but I didn't play long enough to really pick up on them.  This game just wasn't for me.			"

												I don't recommend this, because you can have far more fun by just playing the first 2 crysis games (1 and warhead) over a few times.  It beats the average MMS, and it fun to an extent, however, I'm guessing you haven't played the first games.  PLAY THOSE FIRST YOU♥♥♥♥♥♥!!!!!  They are a shiny and shining example of how modern processing power should be used.  (It should be use to make the game better rather than the graphics only.)			"

												The best New-York based alien invasion you will likely ever play through. While it deviates quite a bit from Crysis 1, Crysis 2 still offers the same nanosuit-based kickassery. Don't worry about the story either, it's confusing at first but all adds together with a little thought. Most of the plot holes left by Crysis 2 are patched up in Crysis 3, and ultimately end up making the entire series a lot more interesting narratively. The game is also simply gorgeous, as a staple of the Crysis franchise. Crysis 1 and 3 are arguably more gorgeous though.			"

												Everything feels like it should be right with this game. You have stealth capabilities, armor, you can quickly change weapon mods on the fly, you can scan your surroundings and look for helpful things. You're a badass black ops nano super soldier dude, and it should be great. But it isn't. Nothing comes together right. I've played a lot of stealth games, and the stealth encounters in this game rarely work out right. People notice you from far away and then all hell breaks loose and all you really have to do is activate your armor, shoot at the bad guys for a few seconds and then hide to recharge your armor. You can go stealth again but it's all going to go back to chaos in the next minute anyway.And that's what the gun fights are like: chaos. It doesn't feel tactical or fun, enemies just seem to spawn out of nowhere, and you mow them down until the game decides to not spawn enemies for a while. Your choice of weapons are limited and there really isn't that big of a difference between them for the most part. You've got shooty rifle, fast shooty rifle, and far away shooty rifle. Also there's a shotgun and maybe a couple handguns. Who cares? They all feel equally unsatisfying to use.Then there's the tiny frustrations. The game showing an objective on the roof, and so you walk to the stairwell door and you press F to open. It doesn't. OK I'll melee it open. Doesn't budge. Maybe it's locked I'll power kick it because I'm in a ♥♥♥♥ing super suit. Nope, the door's content to just stay closed. Apparently in this game you don't use doors. Doors just really aren't a thing. Turns out I was actually supposed to jump out the window. Which is fitting because that's what I felt like doing anyway.Then at the very beginning after a ten minute intro you finally get to play. So I'm walking around and I see it let's me activate a laptop, so I do and a recording starts playing. It's a discussion that reveals some backstory, so I go on my way and walk up the steps, but the sound of the recording fades. What? In the first minute of gameplay you're going to tether me to a single room where I can do nothing but listen to a recording that I don't know how long it is? And if I leave, I miss the backstory. Stupid stupid stupid stupid.And then there's was a, not a cutscene because it didn't cut, but a live scene I guess? Where you can walk around while another character is talking? One of those, and during this scene the other character is like ""here look on this screen at all this exposition about the story"" but I couldn't walk past his couch to look at the screen directly. There was just an arbitrary invisible wall keeping me from going over there. And then the bad guys attack the apartment and my gun pops up like I should be able to use it, and there's a objective telling me to kill the bad guys, but it won't let me shoot out the window at the like five snipers across the way! I'm mashing the fire button but nothing's happening! No, the game doesn't want me to fight there. It wants me to go out into the hallway and fight through the building. Nothing about this is good.I'm sick and tired of games sticking me in a room where all I can do is listen to a guy who's showing me♥♥♥♥♥♥on another screen telling me the story. This is the opposite of the one of the fundamentals of storytelling which is ""show don't tell.""If you buy this game, you're in for disappointment, because it looks like it's going to be so fun, but it just fails at every turn. Don't waste your time. "

												Compared to the first one, this is a mindless corridor shooter with pseudo ""tactical options"" and extremely limited customisation, not to mention the EXTREMELY dumbed-down controls,graphics,physics and AI. Occasional bugs and glitches break the immersion. The soundtrack however is somewhat good, being composed by Hans Zimmer. It is by no means a bad game, but it is not a memorable or innovative experience. I won't even go into details about the story, due to it being generic, with forgettable characters.A mediocre game at best. 6/10			"

Crysis 1 was fantasic due to not only is graphics but also the AI and free roaming natuere of the game the option to handle almost every incounter anyway you wanted until the late stages of the game where things became a bit lineir. Crysis 2 lost me with the first 5 miniutes of the game and me still not having full control of the MPC now i've played some games that take a while to start but I can't forgive a game that keeps taking away control every mission and then has the AI shoot you dead before you fully regain control. also tutorials keep them to the begining of the game so you can get on enjoying the game. the most anoying thing about this game is the AI which is so usless, walking into objects faceing away from you when you've just driven a car into a brick wall right next to them or shot a guy in the head with a un sileced weapon, clustering together its just so stupid ad this is on the hardest diffictly setting which leeds me to my second hate difficly in game comes from the fact that a singlr slavo can kill you when not ussing armmor, i like hard games but i prefer it when the difficlty comes from improved AI reactions more troops stuff like that not this.

												With Crysis 2, the series finally arrived where it was always meant to be. Crysis 2 is the equivalent of the loud, obnoxious blockbuster movie dazzling the audience with its fancy effects. Hell, they even got Hans Zimmer to do the soundtrack.That being said, despite cutting down a lot on the open world aspect, Crysis 2 is probably a better game than the original. At least this one has something resembling proper pacing. The game does a far better job alternating between quiet moments, full-on shootouts and everything in-between. It also throws the player into a couple of memorable scenarios instead of making him infiltrate the same military base over and over again. The gunplay is also improved as it finally has some weight to it and the recoil doesn't seem that random anymore.However, not all areas have been improved upon. The enemy design, for instance, is actually a step back since you're mostly fighting aliens who look like oversized (human) grunts with squishy heads - the predecessor's design definitely looked and felt more 'alien'. The story is still completely irrelevant and only serves as an excuse to drag the player through different setpieces. And yet, the game feels the need pester you with radio chatter and cutscenes regularly even though it neither cares about the characters it introduces nor the story it was supposed to tell. Despite some improvements, Crysis 2 is still lackluster. Although I did enjoy some parts of the game and the scenery of a war-torn New York does have a certain draw to it, a first person shooter that features subpar gunplay is simply not that enjoyable. It doesn't help that the opportunities to use various suit powers have been drastically reduced.Even if it fails at everything else, the game is a competent benchmark to torture your GPU with.			"

												I grabbed this game on sale just to give my newly purchased Geforce 960 a workout although I'm not a big fan of shooters, but this was a big disappointment. The main problem is that shooting simply isn't any fun in this game and as soon as you encounter enemies chaos begins. I just run to the checkpoint to avoid the awkward combat. Nanosuit feels like tacked on gimmicks that are out of place in FPS, so is the supervision mode or however it's called in this game. I swear game like original Half-Life c*aps all over this nonsense maximum edition, and the graphics aren't even that great, they are great from technical standpoint but aesthetically they are very plain and generic. Crytek simply have no talent in game design. I can't give this game more than 4/10 and that is being generous.			"

												Console peasantry at its finest.So I loved Crysis and Crysis Warhead, and just got around to playing this. WTF happenned?The nanosuit options are limited, the customization options are locked until you unlock them? Why? Why the hell are they locked? I already have the suit... poor game design to appeal to 12 year olds playing on peasant boxes.And why do I get nanotech from killing aliens? Another stupid design decisions.The levels are on rails. Instead of playing the game and figuring out a way to overcome challenges, you end up thinking ""What does the developer want me to do for this part?"" ♥♥♥♥ your crappy consoles that can't handle open levels. If you bought a 360 or ps3, the ♥♥♥♥♥iness of this game is your fault.The AI is also a lot worse. Enemies are too stupid to engage you from >50m away, and rarely come to flank you. If I end up with an enemy behind me, it's probably because the game spawned more behind me... just because 12 year old ♥♥♥♥tards.The game is also a lot easier than Crysis and Warhead, even on the highest difficulties.Also, wtf is up with the cheesy nano suit voice? It feels like they put it in just to have a terminator sounding voice to impress little kids. Also, very little blood/gore in this game.All these things combined really kill the immersion and any fun from playing Crysis. Shame.			"

												Great game, wonderful graphics, my i3, 4gb mem and gtx750ti card, ran everything at max with no problems. The story is good. the action intense and fun. I loved playing this game and have only two typically PC gripes. One is that you have to complete each sometimes quite longish sections before the game saves, which in my case means playing them many times, which is annoying, also if I must stop for any reason, I lose all that hard earned progress, even a limited number of free saves would be more PC freindly. My second and lesser gripe, is that I checked online and there were cheats for this game. which I only ever use in single player after completing any game and feel like being randomly destructive. Based on these cheats being available, I purchased Crysis 2 and found to my dismay and unlike the first crysis, the cheats have been blocked on the single player? On multiplayer, sure that makes sense, but blocking single player games will lose them sales and unless this is fixed for the next one, I won't be buying it. Still an excellent game and do highly recommend it if the above don't annoy you too much.			"

												It rarely happens that a sequel is inferior to its prior installments, Crysis 2 fits perfectly in this example. In order to be playable on consoles crytek had to downgrade the game on many departments like destructibility, open world and in-game physics. The result is a linear game that looks pretty, with pseudo sandbox gameplay and many scripted events. If you can get it cheap, maybe give it a shot. Otherwise just pass on this game, and get Crysis 1 or Crysis 3 (Origin exclusive). "

												Lame story which i honestly try to follow ,but lost somewhere in middle of game  ,boring gameplay which should be stealth based but thanks to dumbest ai i ever saw it make the humans looks crappy as hell which they can follow you whole map while you using cloack if you gonna make some noise in room by using some 6-th sense i gues ,on other way they really easy to kill if you do not make noise actually and you an go in one big stealth-kill-streak without anyone even noticing lots of corpses around ,poor level design which make you feels like you on roller coaster and following some line on train .First Crysis still better then this.

												Crysis is one of my favorite shooters of all-time.IMO this is a terrible game compared to the original vision. Played as long as I did because I purchased a new video card and this was one of the games my old GPU choked on. So I did it for GPU testing more than anything.Very fatiguing game to play. Reach an area, get told to defend the area, rinse and repeat. I hate that type of design. Maybe you enjoy it. If you're like me, however, it's a huge turnoff.Only paid 1 dollar for it in EA's humble bundle, but I feel it's not worth it (not your time anyways). Decent to test a new GPU and that's about the only thing I recommend it for.			"

												Ok played Crysis 1  and 2 i thaught there might be a direct conetenum of crysis but im not sure. Anyway crysis is  what u could call the Darksouls of shooter games. Its harder than halo on legendary. when its placed on post human warrior. U must ur inviermntal advantages  tactile advantages and ur skill in combanation to survive the simplest Engagments. Its truely a game worth buying if ur into hardcore war servival games by servival i meen the difficulty to servive is extreemly harder then most shooters.  as far as im conscernd on post human warrior. The phicicle damage to ur body in game is exactly what it would be in real life with a suite like that. its Resistent but not full proof.However  Crysis was more mechanized combat then number 2 number 2 is urben combat.

												there are so many cheap COD knock off's, and lets be honest COD is cheap COD knock off. so with that in mind it is very hard to look at Crysis 2 and see anything else, but this game is actaully not bad. yes there are big michael bay like exsplosions and action, and a lot of shooting, but it is done in the right way. first off the gameplay is pretty cool, you have this nano suit which gives you special abilities. like super strength, armor, and a cloak ablility. you can use all of these ablilities in battle to take out the enemies, maybe you can sneak in and take out dudes silently, or rip a .50 cal off its mount and activate yout armor and just go ham. the game aslo makes you feel like a total bad♥♥♥♥♥ it is great sneaking up picking guys out then cloaking, and the CELL guys panic around screaming to there mates to find me, but they know i too sneak for that♥♥♥♥♥♥ i really suggest playing this game on easy, enemies drop like flies and it just makes you feel the power of the suit, but if you want to go hard the higher diffuculties do provide a good challenge. the story is actaully pretty instresting too, its no bioshock but it's enough to keep you going. so you play as Alcatraz a mute character who was given to nano suit by a dying Prophet. by this time New York is being invaded by the Seth and you must find a cure for the virus, but later in the game they say its transmited by spores so i dunno what it really is. in the big picture of things, the nano suit was created by Seth technology, and truns out the Seth have been laying dormate for like a million years and know they are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that we took there planet over. all in all this game is a total benchmarking tool, the graphics are just so stupidly detailed. like wtf why, but if you can run this game at 60, then you have a good PC. its also notable to have a good cooling system, for your CPU and GPU. i have a water cooled CPU, but not a water cooled GPU. so my GPU is on fire all the time, so just be prepared for that. so yeah, pretty cool♥♥♥♥♥game. you got the story, you got the gamplay, you got the GRAPICS. it all comes together in a pretty cool action game that is totally worth the money. well maybe not 30 bucks, but its only 7 during the sale. so yeah if you like action games get this one. FYI, life alert doesnt work.			"

												The original Crysis blew minds in 2007 with incredible graphics and freedom of gameplay. Unfortunately, Crysis 2 can't say the same. From the very onset, this sadly feels like a generic shooter with a convoluted plot and predictable enemies. The nanosuit adds some (arguably unnecessary) upgrade and customization opportunities, but it doesn't make you feel as superhuman as the version in Crysis 1. If you can pick up Crysis 2 for a couple of bucks on sale, it'll give you about 8 hours of mindless shooter fun. However, given the short length of the campaign and no more multiplayer support I can't recommend it otherwise.			"

												Pros:It's prettyInteresting mechanicsNeat upgrade systemCons:Boring story and gameplayTerrible enemy design and AITerrible ally design and dialogueThis game was basically created to demo the Cryengine. Not many games even run Cryengine. But that's not really the point. ""Can it run Crysis"" was a thing for a while, but no one should bother in the first place. If a game looks awful but runs, and is enjoyable, then it's a game you should play. Crysis 2 is pretty, runs on my machine, but is a chore to play.The game is dry and overcomplicated, and the enemies have too much health. You can sit in front of an enemy dumping bullets into them for 20 seconds while in armored mode and they might die. I tried to finish this game, I really did. But between being unenthused by the story and just outright hating the weirdly difficult* gameplay, I had to stop.* The gameplay isn't mentally difficult, but the enemies can take hundreds of shots without dying, and you having an extremely limited supply of ammo and energy.Also the graphics settings start at ""High"". There are 4 levels. That's just ridiculous. You're not cool, Crytek.			"

But then after 2 hours it just becomes too hard and a little boring, because the story is really horrible, the story has hours of crappy gameplay, all the guns are kinda the same for different kinds, and last of all, Glitches... Way too many. The only 2 good things you can do in this game are...1: Do the elevator party easter egg (If you actually can get to the mission)2:The beginning of the game's enemies are actually pretty cool, until you ecounter aliens, then you never see those funner enemies again unless they are dead bodies.

												While a visually stunning game with an adequate story in campaign mode, Crysis 2 fails to provide the player with anything resembling a useful and accurate aiming mechanism.  From headache-inducing recoil to outrageously imbalanced guns in multiplayer to the omission of adjustable sensitivity in downsight aiming, Crysis 2's multiplayer gameplay soon descends into an unorganised mess that tilts the victory towards those with lucky spawns and players with the patience to grind their ways to the few guns worth shooting.

												A real piece-of-stinking-crap-game that should be offensive to anyone of average or above intelligence. It starts with an absurdly long cutscene that doesn't bring any useful information to the player except that the developers believe that big explosions and shiny graphics will make you interested in this turd of a game. It's broken up by masked cutscenes in the actual engine where you are able to look around, as if they think you're stupid enough that this miniscule form of interactivity would make you feel less like you're watching a dumb action movie about big explosions. And it just keeps dragging on to the point where I started feeling like the purpose was to bore you to death.What follows is probably the worst case of constricting hand-holding I've ever seen. They constantly take the control away from the player in order to ensure you don't miss their ""super cool and awesome scripted events"". As with the interactive cutscenes they make you unable to move, you cannot continue playing until you do what the game prompts you to. By the time I was about to start in on the actual gameplay I was so frustrated at the game that I could not bare to continue. It took some 20 minutes to get that far, 20 minutes which were so poor on actual useful information that it could easily have been cut down to about two minutes, with some time left for filler explosions to make you realise how cool of a game the developers think they've created. Poor game design all over. Absolute garbage. The end.			"

												When this first came out in 2011 I had paid full price for it after being allowed to test it in closed beta multiplayer then open beta because it was pure awesome. I beat the SP, and put close to if not more than 100 hours in MP. The cloaking abilities have been copied by other games but no other games can quite get the full magic of this game. Every aspect of the game is good, from sounds to weapons to enemies to mission structure, if only a bit linear. I doubt you will find any multiplayer games going anymore, otherwise this is for sure worth getting on sale for a fun time playing through sp.			"

Posted: July 4, 2016
												No,  I can tell you why you should NOT play this game.  1. Crap map design. Namely, inconsistency, and no small amount of confusing layout.  This game constantly breaks accepted conventions of FPS.   Doors or ramps that look like they're the way in, but they're not - hah, Trolled!   Some items you can climb over, or into, yet others, which look indentical, you cannot, for no good apparent reason.  This even applies to the weapons: A missile launcher that looks like it's laser guided (ala Half Life) , but guess what?  It's not.  Oops, too bad, you thought you could guide it, now you're dead. Time to start over from where you were 20 minutes ago.At the end of one level, you enter the alien spire, the goal says to destroy it but if you enter the little tunnel with spores your health plummets to near nothing.. afraid to die and be forced to play the level all over again, I felt stuck, I threw in all my grenades.. finally I just charged in, and apparently I was supposed to lose health and do that all along.  No clue was given. Like I said, the game is confusing and inconsistent.Oh, and game companies, when are you going to learn that no one wants the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ useless pistol to start with?  Screw the wimpy weapons, they're not fun.  Just stop already.  That's the ONE freaking convention they decided to stick with?? WHy does everyone do this?? What's the point of a near useless item that packs no punch?3. Constantly moving the goalposts and objectives.   ""Prophet, I need you here"".. you get there,  ""Oh, I need you over there now, nevermind"". Early on in the game, this happens far too much, Gould is a idiot.4. Checkpoints too far between.  I battled for 25 minutes, killed a dozen Ceph, finally bought the suit mod I was saving up for.. got into an ARMORED vehicle (turret), took out the main heavy with it.. then got killed with a single missile that came from freaking nowhere. Was I supposed to get out of the turret at that point? Who knows? Confusion. Yeah, that's fun, having everything you just accomplished erased and  having to do that all over again, no warning.5.  Buggy as HELL.  The first time you drive a tank,  through an underpass, there are two red enemy tanks to meet you.  They couldn't be killed. Even after one exploded, it apparently respawned in place because suddenly it fired more missiles while I was working on the other thank, and killed me.  This happened a number of times..   After the 20th attempt, my tank got stuck in the ground and I couldn't even move.  Quitting the game and reloading fixed it, then I killed them on the first try. 6. Why the hell does the sniper rifle drain the suit of energy ??  How is that even related? Seriously. 7. Speaking of weapons, the selection system is shiite.  Why couldn't they just stick with the normal 1,2,3,4 convention, and MORE IMPORTANTLY allow you to add secondary custom key bindings?  The graphics are very nice, the story interesting, but somebody got SO much wrong with this game. You want a good game?  Play Dishonored, they got it right. "

												Oh my god, I just finished it.It was absolutely hilarious. Cheezy voice acting, hopeless enemy AI, writing that wouldn't happen outside of this and children cartoons, funny prerendered cutscenes, suit talking to you to get yo'♥♥♥♥♥up. The only thing that was not funny is that I wasted my SSD's write cycles for this POS.You see, you play the first Crysis, then Warhead, masterpieces of PC gaming. Beautiful and a pretty good game too. They were called gameplay-less benchmarks back in the day by some people, but I think it's only because they couldn't run it back then, wanted to justify that they couldn't play it. But you got a huge area to explore and think your plan through. And different playstyles were readily available under your middle mouse button. The atmosphere was pretty neat and all that. I mean, whoever played it, will know what I'm talking about - and I will stop here, as this review is not about the first Crysis, but the second one.What do we get, when we first start up? OK, we're a soldier, then the guy in a suit gives us the suit and then shoots himself. Fine, I guess. Something about viri and aliens. Then we run around killing some soldiers because we can't speak, hear some scientist-type guy to get to him and then get to his exgf's apartment (WAIT A MINUTE YOU'RE NOT PROPHET - well no♥♥♥♥♥♥I'm no prophet, ♥♥♥♥♥), then we meet some other guy, then we get betrayed, then our betrayers get betrayed, and we of course almost-die-but-something! lots of times here - this deus ex machina guy must've been busy. Also your suit. Your suit is the answer. You get some♥♥♥♥♥♥from the aliens and there are some funny cutscenes showing some octopi-like alien viri and you kinda hope that when you get that enabler or maybe when you get to another alien structure thingy you'll get some super powers, but let me spoil that for you - no. It sounds convoluted, and I wrote it like that just to give the feeling that this♥♥♥♥♥♥is complex. But it's not Metal Gear type of complex, but needlessly complex. EA was trying way too hard to give you motivation to run around linear corridors and get teleported on each prerendered cutscene with a guy talking in the background. The effect was exactly opposite. I couldn't care less about your laughable plot I just wanted to go through that painful experience, hoping that it would retribute itself later, in the end - just like first Crysis changed its pace a little when you met aliens and gave us the pretty neat zero-g level. No. I mean, first Crysis' writing was pretty bad (lol north koreans lol aliens), but this hit a new record. I'm not sure if I can find a triple-A game with similar level of writing.Enemies are bullet sponges, and I played on normal. That's all I have to say. The CELL guys take way too many shots before finally laying down. The aliens are killed much quicker when you run to them, press V four times, and get their♥♥♥♥♥♥But you know what's more interesting? That you don't really have to fight. There are very few objectives that say to hold your ground and kill every alien we spawned, but besides that, you can run through the map easily. Sometimes they spawn too many aliens and you kinda have to kill them, but then you just shoot until you get health critical, enable armor, regenerate health, disable armor, run again. Or stealth. You can disappear in front of them and they won't try looking for you, just shoot where you were last seen. And then proceed to the objective. Even if you didn't cloak, just ran past them, they still won't run after you, or try to make an ambush or anything. It's a perfect game for pacifists - there's only one human person you have to kill.No interaction with the world. You can't kill that scientist nerd, they were too lazy to add a game-over from that. No physics puzzles. Just running. Pretty close to a Mirror's Edge 2, but that one was released already officially.I'm glad I got this in a humble bundle a long time ago. I even had more fun with FEAR 3, which I kinda regret paying three dollars for. That's saying something. Stay the hell away. Get the first Crysis, that was a really good game, but this? Just don't even think about it.			"

It's just not worth it anymore.--------Gorgeous visuals, nearly pushing my Super-Jesus gaming rig to it's limits when on Ultra settings. Brilliant combat mechanics, immersive and engaging storyline, extremely fun multiplayer (although it would be much nicer if little kids weren't constantly screaming that anybody better than them is a hacker).I bought this for $7.49 from Steam, and dammit, i would have paid 10 times that for this game.GET IT.

												I'll keep this short and sweet.Buy this game if you want to know if your computer is up to snuff. Yes it's released in 2011, but still can melt computers if everything is set to ""ultra"".The story is actually pathetic at best, the only reason why people love this game is because it's used as the best benchmark out there(well, crysis 3 at this point). The crysis game is a more or less a tech demo for the ""cryengine"", so yes, the story is really weak..You will play the game through once(about 8-9 hours worth). Then likely never touch it again, so buy this game when it's on sale.It's a multi-platformer, so don't excpect amazingly amazing graphics, but expect a very nice picture. But the likes of ""watch dogs"" and ""far cry "" will easily put this and crysis 3 to shame. So if you're looking for something serious to bench mark your system, look elsewhere.The game play is okay, clunky at best. You can use steal and not shoot a single bullet, but sometimes the game is so clunky that by being quiet, the game will some how manage to have you run into someone that will cause them to shoot you, in which case, just run for cover, let your stuff regenerate, hit god mode...err...stealth and then walk out a free man.It really isn't a great game..Honestly, it's entertaining, but that's it..Gets boring quick.If you're looking for a ""smart"" FPS, get this. If you just want to have sheer amount of stupid gun blazing fun, wolfenstein..Hands down. My over all rating, 3.8/10 I'm inbetween recommending and not recommending.			"

												An amazing sequel to the first game, with an ebola virus and a new alien race spreading around the world, Prophet rescues you from a Ceph attack and he feels you are the answers, Prophet broke a link and killed himself leaving the nano suit to you, you find a doctor who may have an answer to all this. The Cell are you enemy also. This game has a good story which connects to Crysis 3, the better game compared to all the Crysis games. This game is worth it, multiplayer isnt bad either.			"

												Single player: A lot of fun, I can definately recommend this game for anyone who likes a good shooter with a lot of lore behind it. Multiplayer: Fairly broken because of few reasons. 1. The hitbox is utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in this game. Killcam shows the enemy shot you in the foot, but it still counted like a headshot = instantly killed. 2. The one with the best internet wins. 3. You start as level 1, but play towards people who are lvl 50 with every weapon and attachment in the entire game. 4. No community whatsoever, those who do write here and there are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ trolls.

												If you are a fan of stealth/FPS, this is ""The One"". The game looks astonishingly beautiful, still holding up to par with the newer games in graphics, it lacks a bit in storylinein the start, I wish they continued Alcatraz' story in this one but oh well. The gameplay is good, sometimes AI can be stupid but if you play on higher difficulty(you should after you beat it on normal) the game is really fun. Very linear sadly, you have multiple options to advance through the level but they are all basically the same, if you go over a road or under it, makes very little difference. 6/10 stealth game, 9/10 fps would buy again.

												One of the finest shooters I've ever played. You feel like a badass from start to finish, and the gameplay, while more linear than Crysis, is also more fluid and allows you to switch between many different tactics in a matter of seconds. The campaign is nice and long, and tells an interesting enough story to keep you playing, and the gameplay uses setpieces perfectly as a way of raising the stakes when s*** goes raw. Also, the graphics are still jaw dropping.			"

												With a reinvented combat system and overhauled narrative, you can forget about manually switching suit modes and everything about North Korea. This game now plays like a typical hide / shoot / advance fps, with stealth being less strategic and the occassional suit upgrade. While you'll miss the openness and gameplay variety of the originals, it will blow you away with updated graphics and extremely detailed environments. What Crysis 2 lacks in substance, it more than makes up for in eye-candy and the courage to completely reinvent itself.			"

												The only thing this game has going for it is the dazzeling graphical display it puts on. When you crank up the settings to ultra, it's a truly gorgeous game. However, the gameplay is rather dull, we've all seen this before. There really isn't anything very special to keep you interested. Have you ever played an FPS game before? If yes, good for you, you know what to do in Crysis 2. Yes, there are some neat stealth features, but they never seem to be particularly useful. Sure, you could become invisible, but you're gonna be seen anyways if you want to attack. The downside to each of these abilities makes them not worth using. The plot isn't anything great either, but it does manage to keep the game moving along, if you for some reason want to keep mindlessly trudging through this lackluster experience.			"

												For me, it has become the best game of all time right from the beginning (and I'm not even fan of FPS genre). There's just something about running, jumping and killing in that nanosuit which makes this game absolute bomb - feeling, which no other game can offer... Environment is incredibly beautiful and changing from chapter to chapter. I also like the whole story of Crysis series, and Ceph are probably the coolest and best looking enemies ever :)I'm not even talking about graphics and sountrack...Basically, I've never been so thrilled to play any game repeatedly over and over - I have played single campaign 3 times - 2 times on Post-human warrior, which is really challenging especially against Ceph later in the story.In comparison to Crysis 3 - yeah, last one is even better (environment, graphics, weapons, nanosuit and so on) but too short and too easy with all that Ceph technology involved... So this makes Crysis 2 the best piece from trilogy and one of the best in the genre.10/10 - hands down :)			"

												The basic gameplay of Crysis 2 take very few risks. You can carry two weapons, two explosives, and a rocket launcher. The weapon variety is very limited - most of the guns function and feel the same, and some of them are such direct upgrades that the prior versions all but vanish from later levels. The only non-humanoid enemies are the boss-types, which only show up a few times. Aliens have both gained and suffered from this - they are less of a chore to fight than they were before, but this is as a direct result of them being more similar to the regular human enemies.A number of cues seem to have been taken from Call of Duty, Gears of War, etc. when it comes to other areas. Health is no longer shown as a bar on the HUD, but is instead represented by red splotches showing up on the sides of the screen. This is less precise and guaranteed to get in the way during critical moments by cutting off peripheral vision and blurring colors. The player can now lean out of cover by holding the right mouse button when near the edge of a barrier or wall, but the only way to find the sweet spot is by edging up against the corner until the prompt appears and risking a bullet in the arm.The Nanosuit's operation has been streamlined, and now feels less like a vehicle and more like a passive system. Only the Stealth and Armor modes can be manually selected; Speed and Strength have been merged into a new category, Power is now activated automatically when the player uses a corresponding action. With direct access to only two modes, the Nanosuit's operation is more intuitive, but also feels less rewarding to successfully use. Minor upgrades may be unlocked, but only a few have visible effects.Stealth mode hasn't changed much. Sneaking past enemies is still just as easy, and the majority of enemy AI is still lazy enough to simply shoot at the point at which you disappeared from sight. However, a few enemies are located at the other extreme, and have inexplicably impeccable aim no matter how visible you are.Armor mode also performs the same, transferring damage from health to energy. However, it has suffered from the changes to other systems. When active, hexagons appear on the corners of your screen. This meansit becomes nearly impossible to tell whether you have Armor mode active when you are close to death, because the screen's contrast drops and the red splotches cover most of the screen. Worse, this is usually when it is most critical to know if you have Armor mode active.Power mode is hard for me to get behind entirely. On the one hand, streamlining all of the extraneous suit functions into automatic actions makes for faster action and less micromanaging during combat. On the other hand, you can't sprint without suit battery left, and you throw items about as far as most regular people could. Furthermore, melee attacks are almost useless - it's far more effective to simply shoot the foe with whatever you have in your weapon.The binoculars have gotten an upgrade this time around, and now highlight many objects of interest through walls and floors. A small number of enemies may be tagged through the visor, which will let you see their locations even when not using them. It also has a new function called ""Nanovision,"" which provides a thermal-esque color overlay pointing out enemies and objects of interest. However, it suffers from a short range, and drains the suit's batteries while in use.Level design has suffered. The developers have ditched the spacious, free-roaming environments of Crysis 1 in favor of much smaller areas. Although initially confusing, this decision actually meshes better with Crysis 2's gameplay than more open environments. Sprinting is slower, and vehicles are rarely placed in locations where they could be effectively used by you. Gone as well are the large turret and vehicle sections, which is only an improvement as far as I'm concerned. Additionally, most objectives are simply to reach a point behind a number of enemies, although this greatly incentivizes turning on cloak and walking past them all instead of dealing with them.Although not a masterpiece, the story does an effective job of both moving the plot forward and maintaining player interest. Unfortunately, most of the major players have only the bare minimum of characterization, and there are several gaping plot holes. That said, I rather enjoyed it, and the story and gameplay combined to keep me interested enough to continue playing without it feeling like a slog. Unfortunately, there were several scenes where player interaction suffered to make way for the story, which left me feeling like a non-participant in the game I'd paid money to play. A few well-done scenes, however, managed to hit the sweet spot between player interaction and storytelling where I felt involved in the character's situation, instead of left out of it.Crysis 2 suffers from a number of basic design problems. Doors are largely unopenable, except for some specific plot-necessary ones, which are usually similar to every other door in the room, and the player must check each one for a prompt. Hints given after death are almost never helpful, and after a while start feeling a little mocking. A quicktime event later on has nearly the exact same thing happen regardless of if you succeed or fail, except that if you fail it kills you. Some weapons take up one of your two slots, but can't be refilled from ammo crates, making them dead weight when they run out of ammo. Autosaves are located very far apart most of the time, meaning that dying could set you back a lot more than you might have expected.Despite being a AAA title, this game has a remarkable number of glitches, crashes, and sloppy mistakes. I've seen every type of enemy try to shoot me through walls, over and over. Possibly my favorite example of the sheer sloppiness of the AI in this game is the number of times I have seen a humanoid yell ""FRAG OUT!"" and then throw a grenade at the wall he's taking cover behind, only to ignore it as it bounces back, ticks down, and explodes, killing him.To summarize: is Crysis 2 a game you should play? Sure, if you already own it, or if a friend owns it and offers to let you play it. It is entertaining, despite its flaws. However, that isn't the real question I'm answering here: is Crysis 2 a game you should BUY? No. Crysis 2 brings very little to the table that cannot be found, and done better, in other games, for either the same price or cheaper. The game's primary mechanic, the Nanosuit, is interesting, but in the end, it doesn't stand out very much from the crowd, especially with the lengths it took to stand closer to titles like Call of Duty and Gears of War. The story is passable and gets the job done, but certainly nothing to write home about, especially with its large plot holes and how little characterization most of the characters get. Most of the weapons differ only superficially from each other, and the enemies differ even less. Crysis 2 is not the worst purchase you could make, but you could certainly do better.			"

												Not that great of a successor to the original Crysis. The game shipped out with only dx9 capabilities, missing a dx11 patch, high res textures, and came with a badly optimized way of rendering water underneath the level thus requiring further resources than necessary for the level. The game is much more closed in level design than Crysis 1, so as to appeal to a more broad basic FPS market, and also ops for a mute, personality-less main character that you play as. While Cryengine 3 does look impressive, you can tell this was rushed in order to be released soon and to consoles. While some suit functions are nicely streamlined like running, and power punching, the drain rate on the suit and amount of enemies you encounter bring a rather pretty but somewhat boring FPS experience. Still, the soundtrack, modding support, graphics, gun recoil and level design is worth at least playing to see how you feel.Multiplayer is nothing to write home about and the running makes the game crawl to an incredible low pace.

												Crysis 2 Maximum Edition Crysis 2 continues off the epic events set forth in motion during the crysis conflict. Amidst the chaos you are thrown straight into the conflict behind the visor of a multi billion dollar prototype nanosuit weapon. From the second you take control of the nanosuit the player is smacked in the face with stunning visuals, effects and sounds. There are tons of ability combinations that the player can utilize to maximize the effects of their nanosuit to meet their needs as they rifle theiir way throughh thhe hordes of enemies.From start to finish this game hits hard with epic action that keeps escalating and just when you think it can't get any better the game comes at you with a sleeve of new tricks.This game had me on the edge of my seat and i found it hard to stop playing. Once you get going and thhe action kicks in full effect you wont want to quit either. So go crush some squids in your rage fueled onslaught. You won't be dissapointed.			"

												Crysis 2 was the most enjoyable of the crysis franchise for me (note* do not own crysis 3 yet).Exciting, well paced, its campaign was reminisent of COD4's campaign, arcadey and fun.The nanosuit integrated strength/speed in this iteration of Crysis and it was a welcomed change.You now choose from Armor or Stealth for your suits powers.There was an added suit powerup rpg element added, but its thin and only is there to encourage the killing of the more difficult opponents, the alien steph.AI works well as usual for the crysis series, and is a suitable and fun challenge at the Normal difficulty (which I played through on).Weaponry was mostly boring, although the sniper rifle was amazing and powerful.  Definitely could have used some weaponry variety as most guns felt identical or were identical.  The special x-43 was not very fun or special.  I stuck with the rifle whenever it was available.Completed the game, took 7:30 minutes of actual in game campaign play.Multiplayer is interesting and fun too, a sleeper hit.Recommended at sale level, as I never buy a full priced game and neither should you (drive prices down, $60 is never reasonable for a gaming experience unless you are talking skyrim type games with 100+ hours of  atual gameplay).

Crysis 1 was a game i played through almost in one session, but crysis 2 was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pain to even pass the first stages.There is almost no freedom, you just have to follow the blue marker. The game feels like its made with absolutly no love, what i find very typical for EA games.So I don't recommend this game unless you can get it for a good deal which would be about 5 euros or less.(Sorry for mistakes, im not from an english talking country)			"

												Buy?Maybe=TL;DR=Crysis 2 - Maximum Edition is a solid, though largely unremarkable shooter that does it's fanbase a disservice by dropping the free roam and multi-optional gameplay from the original for a linear, Call of Duty like experience that obviously tries to hard to copy CoD, but never took much steam from the series and harmed the reputation of Crysis in the process. The game is fine for folks that like CoD campaigns and the Crysis theme. =Overview=Note: I completed this game in 10 hours within Origin. Steam probably shows no time for me. Crysis 2 - Maximum Edition is futuristic, modern military shooter set in the Crysis universe: which means it mostly involves gunplay, combat options, well detailed environments and use of the Nanosuit, which grants Supersoldier like ehancements to the average Marine. Unlike it's Crysis 1, Crysis 2 is even more linear due to a level design that shoves players down corridors and streets with little options for exploration and a game design that provides no incentive to customize your gameplay. It's essentially a Call of Duty campaign with a Crysis theme.=Presentation=It looks as good or better than most games of its time. The nanosuit is beautifully detailed as usual, and character models seem to look better when you can see them close. The Ceph look great up close and would make for some excellent real world figures. World textures are generally good, but not perfect - screens and signs look great, but wall textures look console quality. Physics act as expected and rarely I've had moments where an enemy body would hilariously fly off the screen without good reason or get stuck in geometry ""Bethesda game style"". I played this in Origin (don't remember why), sI couldn't get screenshots. Not that it mattered, as there were only a few times I wanted one, versus the 100+ times in Crysis 1.Sound design is as it should be. Combat sounds like guns, explosions, and melee have the expected punch that a AAA game should, though I don't specifically remember stuff like loud echoes in tight spaces or super loud bangs from sniper rifles and shotguns (which still sound good, but not so loud that you would need earmuffs or head gear in real life). The soundtrack is of great quality which should be considering much of it is composed by Hanz Zimmer, but beyond the main menu music, is good, but unmemorable. I do however really like the menu music, which really has that dramatic, epic, and dreadful feeling as seen from Modern Warfare 2.Voice acting is good, though you probably won't remember any voices beyond Prophet and the nanosuit. =Gameplay=The open world gameplay has been stripped down to a bog standard corridor shooter with occasional open spots with few options. While Crysis 1 was still a very linear game. it gave you options on how to approach ""objective areas"" well before you got to it, unless there was only one way into it. Now, you're following a path and then you reach the objective area in which you do have a few options, by taking a slightly alternate path to flank, creeping around to perform stealth kills (or not kill at all), finding a turret, vehicle, or explosive barrel to use against packs of enemies....Honestly, the combat options are actually equal to that of Crysis 1, but it generally feels that the best option is to take care of the biggest or nearby threats, and then hustle it to the objective, as it will eventually take you to the next area for you to skip the enemies. Stealth is effective, but it's much easier to use cloak to occasionally hide from enemies after combat or get the first shot on them.Considering that your upgrades all come from Nano Catalysts which drop from the Ceph enemies (which stupidly enough, disappear after a certain time. This aint the NES era!), there's no bonus or detriment to killing enemies a certain way - you may as well run and gun since the heavier enemies require explosives or heavy weaponry to take down. The upgrade system provides handy upgrades that slightly customizes your play, but nothing to dramatically change your playstyle - you could probably play the game successfully without even bothering with upgrades.The gunplay is solid, though nothing new. Guns feel good to use, especially the Feline Revolver, Heavy Machine Gun (which are pretty neat to dismount), and some of the later ""Power weapons"" like the L-Tag grenade launcher or the XFire. The use of abilities are more streamlined than the first game, so instead of switching modes to enable every action, the suit enhances you where it makes sense. Your speed mode is enabled the moment you run, super jump (holding the Jump key to jump higher than normal), and climb (your climbing speed can be upgraded). Strength mode engages when you melee, detach HMGs, or steady yourself with Shift to shoot more accurately - however, it can be enabled manually to reduce fall damage as well as the enchancements listed earlier. Armor mode and cloak however, are much like the previous game where they need to be activated and deactivated manually unless energy is depleted. However, Armor now does drain energy over time. While I miss the RPG-esque styling of the original, this does work better, but you have to be careful when sprinting around and armoring/cloaking behind cover - you will be looking at the energy bar alot. The function that allows you to toggle different suit modes is seriously less responsive and clunky. Before in Crysis 1, I could easily roll the mouse while holding the assigned mouse key to select a mode. Now in Crysis 2, that function is still partially there, but sometimes, the game doesn't recognize where your mouse is and doesn't register a selection, requring me to move my mouse alot to get to where I need. I believe this has to due with the fact of having the game ported to console systems, so the circle could probably recognize which ""zone"" the player pushed the stick. While I can just as easily use assigned keyboard keys, I preferred the radial mouse key menu.My biggest gripe about the game is it's clear ""I want to be Call of Duty too!"" Syndrome. Extremely linear game design, regularly scripted setpiece/cutscene moments, ""slow walking can't use your gun while listening sequences"", hunts for mostly pointless and tallied collectibles (there are keys for civilian vehicles, but you won't be driving much in this game. I entered a car maybe 6 times?), and on rails tank rides. Don't forget typical military jargon. I'm sure EA coerced the developers to make the game much like Call of Duty to compete with them. This means this game does pratically nothing unique for the genre or industry and made itself another CoD clone to get lost in the shuffle. You even have those typical satellite, wireframe debriefing overviews like every other modern military shooter does, but at least I personally like those. Multiplayer community is nearly dead with about 3-6 active servers. The little I played was a decent CoD clone, but I got kicked out of every server because the game couldn't verify DLC purchases, even though, i just put in the key to unlock the Maximum Edition  ""DLC"". Don't buy this for multiplayer. Like all games of this type these days, you can't use custom weapons and classes until after gaining XP.=Summary=Crysis 2 is a decent linear shooter, but you're not missing out on much. If you're a core shooter gamer, chances are that you're playing something or could be playing something else better anyways. If you were wanting more of Crysis 1, checkout it's modding community, or maybe even Crysis Warhead and Crysis 3 (I haven't played them yet). I can't recommend this to somebody who really values their time and doesn't want to waste it on anything but the best games - it mostly a standard modern military shooter.			"

												I've been having stupid problems, and I can't find any tutorials on how to fix this crap. I like this game, but I think that this version of Cryengine and how it runs eventually turns ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I have blurs around my freaking hud, and some texts are all warped and stupid, and there are some blurs around objects and image effects that it should not be affecting, so there is no telling what's wrong with this freaking game, and I can't get a real uninstall of the game, thanks to ♥♥♥♥ing steam cloud, and it keeps all my damn data, and I can't fully make it to where the game is completely new to my computer, so that the bugs or whatever is causing it can go away, and I'd like help with this crap. Because when you ""uninstall"" and ""reinstall"" games from Steam, it's like it isn't really a reinstall, it keeps all of my crap that I DON'T want, and I feel ripped off, and I am really freaking mad.

												This is, in my opinion, the best FPS that I have played so far. The thing I liked most about this game was that it required you to be smart about how you confronted your enemies. Sure, you can run into the enemy fire, blow all of your ammo and try to kill everything, but more likely than not, you'll die pretty fast and have to redo the mission. Rather, to be successful in this game, you have to be smart about how you take out your enemies, whether it be sniping them from afar, or stealthing up behind them and killing them. Crysis 2 is not as open world as the first one, which has both its pros and its cons. Overall though, a great game with a good storyline, lots of action, and lots of fun.			"

												This game is full of cancer. Linear and lame story, PRESS F TO LOOK, motion blur, I can go on forever.But the worst part is definitely map design and stealth system. All the maps are abominable mix between sandbox and cowadooty linear- I mean, what's the point of putting *options* in itty bitty small sectors? After all it boils down to 'evade everything' or 'kill everyone and take stuffs'.Overall AI, including stealth system, is also messed up. As soon as you make a noise, get yourself seen, AI will notice and suddenly you get fired from eight directions. If you don't make your stealth kill really quiet and unseen, you will get warm welcome everywhere again. And watch out for baddies on mounted weapons- They see miles away, through walls. But if you get them to open combat, they suddenly become dumb. Dumb as rock. Wait, dumber than rock. All they do is hide, fire, hide, nade, rinse and repeat. That is, unless they start glitching and do nothing. Yes, that happens.To summarize, I feel that I've paid to eat someone's poop without expecting. I don't want my money back; Just take my rage and memory back. I don't want to remember♥♥♥♥♥♥ That includes you, Prophet.			"

												Kauft das Spiel nicht wenn Ihr Multiplayer oder DX11 genießen wollt.Don't buy this game if you want to use dx 10 or dx 11 or if you want to play multiplayer.Ich habe das Spiel am 03.07.2014 gekauft.

Nachdem ich nun alle Tipps, Tricks & Kniffe aus dem Steam-forum aber auch aus anderen Foren probiert habe muß ich leider feststellen das es sich nur mit dem Zusatz ""-dx9"" während Verwendung eines Cracks spielen lässt.Nachdem ich nunmehr geschlagene 7 Stunden mit dem Support von Electronic Arts telefoniert habe, welcher ja für Crysis 2 zuständig ist, und keine Lösung gefunden werden konnte um das Spiel auf 7 verschiedenen frisch installierten PCs und laut Support mit für Crysis 2 optimierten Einstellungen zum laufen zu bringen, erhielt ich eine Bestätigungsemail in der EA diese Vorgänge dem Drittanbieter bestätigt und auf ein Reklamation hinweist.Wie Reklamiere ich nun bei Steam?Fernabsatzgesetzt ist auch für Steam gültig, ok, doch da der Steamsupport mir leider nicht Antwortet, was tun?PS.

After I got off the phone now beaten 7 hours with the support of Electronic Arts, which is indeed responsible for Crysis 2, and no solution could be found to bring to the game running on 7 different freshly installed PCs and as support told ""with optimized settings for Crysis 2"" I received a confirmation email in which EA does confirm these processes to the third party providers (steam) and points to a complaint. So how do I complain on Steam? Distance selling law is also valid for Steam, ok, but since the Steam Support me not to reply, what to do?PS. Nearly all Multiplayer-servers have been closed			"

												I've sunk a decent amount of time into both Crysis and Crysis 2, and I have to say I like them both equally, but for very different reasons.  Crysis was an amazing shooter, pure and simple, with it's huge open world and multiple, distinct combat modes.  Coming into Crysis 2, I expected more of the same.  Instead, I got something different, but not necessarily in a bad way.  The combat's been streamlined in this game, and what I mean by that is, the nanosuit's different modes are more integrated.  The only dedicated modes are Armor and Stealth, while Strength and Speed only activate while spriting, jumping, and using melee attacks.  The result is a much different feel that Crysis.  Rather than switching between specific combat modes, it feels more . . . more like a traditional shooter, I guess, with some special tricks thrown in.  Basically, your only two options when confronted with an enemy are A) use armor and try to tough out his attacks or B) use stealth and ambush him.  The level design is also more linear than Crysis, usually confined to a street, block, or square in NYC.  But while I didn't like combat as much as Crysis, I immensly enjoyed the story.  Can't say quite what intrigued me so much about it, but I'm a longtime fan of sci-fi and this really scratched that itch for me.  So, long story short, if you only play games for the combat experience you may not like this game as much as Crysis, but if you're like me and you enjoy a good story as much as the game itself you'll probably find Crysis 2 worth your while.

												I'm recommending this because it works. It's a functionable shooter, nicely optimized, looks very good(even in 2014) with some very obvious AAA features.That being said it's a really dumbed down game. Way back when in the confusing times of 2009-1012, a lot of games jumped ship to adopt a Call of Duty style gameplay, development and whatnot because of the cash cow Activision had turned that into. This is a perfect example of such a crime. Levels are heavily linear, ""go here"" objective markers, suit powers are streamlined into 2 seperate catagories with a ""3rd"" that's just there to have an excuse for sprint and higher jumping, a very superficial sci-fi story with memorable characters but no substance. Again, this isn't bad against the game, none of these features are actually detrimental to the game in any form and they all work as they should. But the creativity is long gone. Your approach to levels comes down to if you want to stealth or not. What comes out is a corridor shooter set in the streets of New York, with 2 sections that open up and make you wish the whole game was set in levels of the like.So in short, it works. The game is fine in that sense. As a sequel to Crysis? No, it's pretty inferior. But if you can get it cheap, get it.P.S. There have been some funky resolution issues with AMD users. For some reason this game tries to cap out at 24hz. It won't go into actual fullscreen. You can either force it borderless windowed mode, change your settings on your monitor to 50hz, or download some 3rd party fixes like RadeonPro.			"

												I bought this game, because I wanted to get Crysis 3.  This along with all the other Crysis stuff were on sale for a bundle, so I did.  I played this game on the 360, and wasn't to thrilled about the campaign.  The multiplayer was one-sided and biased towards cloaked camping.  To my dismay, the game looked just as amazing on 360, though the PC can squeeze out a little better particle effects.The part of this I didn't like, was that I thought I never played the game, but after a few minutes, I realized I had, and the experience really didn't get much better from there.  I kept playing it, inhopes that maybe I quit playing it on the 360, but nope... everything was repetitive in the same way that it was, and Deja vu kicked in.  I was done with this.I recently bought a GAME BUNDLE for the 360, and Crysis 3 happens to be sitting on my shelf... But I feel like I would be cheating myself to play it on the 360, to make that judgement call, if Crysis 3 is good or not... but if Crysis 2 gave me any ideas, it would be to just never play it.If you are thinking about Getting Crysis 3, or looking for a fantastic Multiplayer game, DO NOT play this game.

												This game has really awesome graphics. The AI and mechanics of this game are still good but somehow they don't seem to be as good as the first crysis. One thing that kinda bummed me out is they didn't do a good job picking up where the story left off, idk if this game is supposed to be later than the last game or what...but it doesn't seem to continue the story of the first crysis. one thing that made Crysis 1 so good is the ability to choose any route you want, Crysis 2 has some of that but the game literally tells you when you have extra routes availiable and for the most part seems a bit more linear. All in all both games are worth the money and it would be really hard choosing between the two.			"

												this wont be my longest review as to put it bluntly there inst really much in the game itself to review but okay here goes ...  so i was a big fan of the first Crysis game, was a ridiculously stunning piece of design with a solid frame work of story, mechanics and gameplay .. a model shooter for its time despite being generations ahead of other shooters of the day. saying this i was always going to be skeptical of a sequel as sequels are usually a bit rubbish. and to a degree this game both exceeded my expectations and at the same time failed to meet them. weird i know but it managed it.the game is  set years after the Lingshan island incident that saw the deaths of all but two members of Raptor team (Prophet and Psycho) new york is in the grip of a deadly virus infecting its citizens and the CELL corporation has stepped in to take control of the mess that has ensued. you take a step away from raptor squad in this game and play as a strong but silent (and i mean literally silent) marine named Alcatraz. you are sent on a recon mission to rescue a scientist when your submarine is hit by the CEPH aliens and all of your team is wiped out and you are left floating in the river until you are saved by prophet. prophet then places you into the suit to save your life and (SPOILERS) .. in short you must then progress the game as Alcatraz trying to save New York from the grips of the CEPH and CELL alike. now i like the story for this game i think its well written and well paced for a shooter .. its not the most imaginative story in the world but it appeals to me.the game itself is your standard shooter so don't expect much in terms of adventurous mechanics or gameplay. mechanics are to be expected as pretty solid .. you run jump, sprint,slide and ledge grab same as the last game with solid steel shooting mechanics (you shoot the guys and they die nothing overly adventurous really) some new toys in terms of suit upgrades allowing you to swap out nodes to allow for different approaches in combat which i quite like. you can swap out weapons with various attachments to suit stealth and various other aspects and play styles and with a wide variety of weapons available you can get quite adventurous in how you want to play out the situation. the mechanics for the powers hold nothing new in this game so i wouldn't get  your hopes up about that part. the little bits of tat you can collect throughout the game as well can be a bit annoying to find as Crytek were very imaginative in the hiding places. the energy bar can seem a bit stupid in terms of longevity to start with but you get used to being a bit more tactical with it after the first attempt to Rambo a group of enemies winds up with Alcatraz having more holes in him that a block of Swiss cheese. the graphics really are the main selling point of this game and they sell it very well. i played on the PC with a reasonably powerful machine and i like to think im quite demanding from my games but this game blew me away. the detail of the environment is not flawless but it is close to being so, the level of detail that Crytek have given this game takes it to a whole new level for the PC gamer especially on ultra settings. the Crytek engine allows for stunning visuals that make the world the player is experiencing all that more immersive. but excellent graphics do not make up for the shortfalls the game has in terms of the average story and the generic shooter gameplaythis is a game where i wish steam would have another recommendation button for i think its decent but not amazing, the story is good the gameplay is solid despite being a tad generic but the graphics do make up for this sin some way .. in the end i would recommend the game to fans of the series and FPS fans but if you are looking for a great sci-fi game with some depth then this inst the game for you.. this game is great ... but flawed ...

While I feel the storyline was a bit weak (which I freely admit may be due to not having yet played the first game) the gameplay and the graphics were both fantastically solid, and it provided me with a good deal of fun. The multiplayer was also quite good, back when it was released, and I've found few other FPS multiplayer games that I enjoyed more.I suggest this game to anyone interested in a good, fun FPS.			"

												Hmm. For once I was actually pleasantly surprised, well, only half way, but more on that later. This game is a pretty good game. Solid game. I don't really have a lot to complain about, which is a first. No control issues, crazy, huh? Aiming mechanics work very well. Cool experience overall. Good story. If there is one thing I can complain about, is that the enemies are very bullet-spongy, and I played the game on Easy, to enjoy the story more. They take WAY too many bullets than I considered necessary... But oh well, such is the nature of the beast, probably you would've blitzed through the game way too fast if the enemies took only 4-5 bullets instead of 20... The campaign itself took about 10 hours and it was decent. I kinda got bored through the middle of it but I'm not so sure it was the game, the game was like any other triple A FPS, I might just be getting bored of triple A FPSs in all honesty. Action-packed, waves after waves of enemies, the occasional QTE action sequence. FPS by the book. What really shocked me was when I tried to play some multiplayer after I finished the game, well the problem with that is... THERE IS NO MULTIPLAYER. At least no more, since the servers got shut down a few months ago and I didn't have the inspiration of looking that up before buying the game. So I was unpleasantly surprised when I got no piece of some MP action... Oh well, I'll just cry myself to sleep tonight and tomorrow morning everything will be OK. I do recommend this game, but don't expect multiplayer, since everything you'll get is a good campaign, and that in itself is satisfying enough! ;)			"

												Most of the game is spent being dragged along a path from one character exposition dump to an obivious ""almost won but didn't"" scene where something blows up, you lose control to a cutscene or lose consciousness. While it's not as bad as modern shooters, as you do get the freedom to accessorize yourself with the nanosuit and to attack the way you want and the story isn't complete garbage, I still beileve this game should be judged on it's own merits. Not really worth paying full price, maybe if it's on sale and you want to play a dumb shooter.			"

												Not that great of a successor to the original Crysis. The game shipped out with only dx9 capabilities, missing a dx11 patch, high res textures, and came with a badly optimized way of rendering water underneath the level thus requiring further resources than necessary for the level. The game is much more closed in level design than Crysis 1, so as to appeal to a more broad basic FPS market, and also ops for a mute, personality-less main character that you play as. While Cryengine 3 does look impressive, you can tell this was rushed in order to be released soon and to consoles. While some suit functions are nicely streamlined like running, and power punching, the drain rate on the suit and amount of enemies you encounter bring a rather pretty but somewhat boring FPS experience. Still, the soundtrack, modding support, graphics, gun recoil and level design is worth at least playing to see how you feel.Multiplayer is nothing to write home about and the running makes the game crawl to an incredible low pace.

												A lot of people put the original Crysis game as a massive tech demo... that being said:  I really enjoyed the original Crysis.  Jump High, Punch Hard, Run super fast!  I felt like superman gimped a bit.  The original also had a lot of open area to have fun and ways to approach/landscape to expore.Crysis 2; removed all the cool abilities.  No jumping, running, punching skills, and no open world-ish areas.   Just cloaking and armor in pre-designed combat areas.All that being said:  It is not a bad game.  I had a good time cloaking around and using melee (Melee is OP - I used it on 70% of all mobs or more.)  The city scape looked fantastic even if the close up graphics felt fuzzy.  The story wasn't half bad but it really made a leap from sci-fy to magical/spiritual in some areas.Some of the guns were fun to shoot and explosions were awesome.  However Melee was OP and I abused cloak/melee most of the time.  The AI was smart when you tried to engage in gun battles but they got pretty dumb when I was ballistic cloak/melee.Overall - a pretty good FPS game and sci-fy story; however I couldn't shake the feeling that the first one was better.

												Thoroughly disappointing, console-hobbled sequel to one of the best free-roaming shooters ever.No quicksave or custom save, checkpoints only.Tiny areas combined with lack of custom save means there's no real possibility of playing the long stealthy game which was so fun in the first game, it has essentially become a cover-based shooter with no real option of playing it any other way.RUBBISH weapon sounds, all of the automatic ones in this game sound like playing cards in a bicycle wheel.  Tinny and with no power behind them.Having a points-earning upgrade system for the suit is nothing short of comical.  After how much you feel like a soldier in the first game this system destroys any possibility of immersion and screams YOU'RE PLAYING A GAME!  COLLECT SHINIES!  You might as well be Mario collecting rings (hehn) I mean stars.Yes, it looks quite nice.  There is little else going for this game.If you haven't done it then go and play Far Cry instead.  10 years old now!  And so much better than this. "

												Crysis 2 is an awesome game. It looks freakin awesome in MOST parts. I did find things like fire effects and water to be a little bit consolish for some reason (worse than the first game I mean,) and no MSAA? OR QUICKSAVES? why? but everything else looks just AMAZING. I would also like to mention that the game never went under 35 frames (but not over 78.) GameplayFor most of the singleplayer you go around shooting faceless grunts who realistically fall and bleed all over the place, but the twist here is that you get a few superpowers to help you out. For some reason in the future the nanosuit recieves a downgrade from it's original 5 powers (now chaged to 3) but in return battery usage and visible UI have a few minor upgrades that keep it worth your time to use. The suit also has a new power where you get to play ghost hunter and use your thermal camera, and now the second you grab someone in the neck they die from shock or something (idk why grabbing people makes them die.) I would also like to say that gone are the free roaming jungles of Crysis because the devs thought making the areas as small and clausterfobic as possible would really please fans of the original (not add MSAA options is enough to displease the fanbase) but if you can get pass crysis 2 was marketed to CallofHaloFutureSoldiers it can be dismissed as EA's marketing flaws, BUT that does not stop crysis 2 from being freaking awesome and a blast to play and replay. I should probably also mention the collectable items throughout the level, but due to the linearity of the gameplay you'll either miss them right under your nose (erm facemask) or they'll be staring you right in the face with blinking lights around it saying PICK ME UP I'M USELESS! I would also like to mention that they broke the physics too. I'm serious they took something perfect and said naaaaaaa console players can't handle that, now, it's very rare to be able to throw enimies into each other.StoryThis is where I feel the game excels and also ruins my expectations. You play as a marine corps guy who isn't much for words who gets a suit from Eli Vanc- I mean Prophet, and you have to save the world because Prophet just wasn't good enough? Idk it's never really explained why he gives you the suit... and doesn't tell any of his friends about it... and you start killing people because they fired first. Oh, and a nerd named Gould keeps bothering you to hurry the hell up and get to him... because... I still don't know for sure why he called, but everything is pretty so I shouldn't care should I, and after that you murder more helpless victims until you start taking orders from some other guy, and he betrays you and you learn that anything with a human face is good while you should just pump as much lead into everyone else. That is, until you get to the leader of the blue clad suicide unit, and this is where I got a little mad. Spoiler: you kill him. Don't ask for answers or try to change him just let him swear at you until your magical touch of death kicks in and you get to throw him out a window. Yay... anyway aliens happen and all the pollution and bad fire effects in New York turn their color from blue to red for no reason and what else would you do but give a little on the fly dissection. You know the more I think about it the more I feel like the games major enemies stem from when a sibling says: ""well he started it!"" after your younger brother is hospitolized because you touched his neck or something.OpinionYeah, this is some good game if you completely forget the first one ever existed, and the ability to walk 5 feet without blowing off some alien's head. It's actually really fun so yeah on a steam sale get this one it's pretty freakin awesome			"

Sneakng around things is a good little challenge however killing someone on its own goes out of the question and the whole plot gets kind ruined (SPOLIER SPOLIER!) - When you play the 2nd part of the first mission, you see the dame alians and it kind ruins that feeling that something is out there but you don't know what and that you think it could come out at any secound, yeah that feeling died before it had the chanse to even come to life.I will addmit though dispite the disapointment in sneaking, build up and the questionable physics where you can hardly throw a can to the end of a hall way but you can kick a car half way across a parking lot, Its a fun shooter that gets interesting but nothing that really stands out, multi-player looks good... But its has died from what I hace attempted to join online games.I'd only really recommend this game if you want to find out what happens after crysis one. DO NOT START CRYSIS HERE, TERRIBLE PLACE TO START THE SERIERS. Its a good addition to the series, however it has lots of moments where they get you on the edge of your seat, however they tend to be eaither short lived or sometimes drag on, but still they do get you on the edge of your seatAgain like I said with the first crysis, there is an ""Easy"" difficulty but don't be foold by this, its still anything but, I feel like the game just doesn't have the same freedom as crysis did where you actually picked up guns and ammo boxs for ammo and that you could unequip your weapons and just bring out your hands, I thought that was a nice touch but I havn't been able to do that in crysis.SO, Overall I am not as impressed by this game as I was with the first one, HOWEVER. Its still fun, quite satifing. They could of had stupid zombies (if you play the game you'll know what I mean when you see the people around the city) they would of been an odd but nice touch. I wouldn't expect to make much of an online gaming experience but hey, you might find a few embers of a great fire! Story is much better in terms of length than it was in crysis where it felt too shortStill, after all that its only really worth about £7-£8 so when its on sale next bag it.			"

												Sure, the game is more linear than the original Crysis in terms of the playable world, but the game still gives you multiple ways to make it though a mission, which I find to be just fine. The visuals are stunning and gun play is very fun!			"

												I bought this game, because I wanted to get Crysis 3.  This along with all the other Crysis stuff were on sale for a bundle, so I did.  I played this game on the 360, and wasn't to thrilled about the campaign.  The multiplayer was one-sided and biased towards cloaked camping.  To my dismay, the game looked just as amazing on 360, though the PC can squeeze out a little better particle effects.The part of this I didn't like, was that I thought I never played the game, but after a few minutes, I realized I had, and the experience really didn't get much better from there.  I kept playing it, inhopes that maybe I quit playing it on the 360, but nope... everything was repetitive in the same way that it was, and Deja vu kicked in.  I was done with this.I recently bought a GAME BUNDLE for the 360, and Crysis 3 happens to be sitting on my shelf... But I feel like I would be cheating myself to play it on the 360, to make that judgement call, if Crysis 3 is good or not... but if Crysis 2 gave me any ideas, it would be to just never play it.If you are thinking about Getting Crysis 3, or looking for a fantastic Multiplayer game, DO NOT play this game.

												Crysis 2, running Crytek 2.This game is beautiful beyond comprehension atleast for it's time of release, despite the graphics being heavy on users due to it being so advanced in not only just graphics itself but the mechanics and functionality is a whole lot smoother than it's predecessor I haven't finished this game on PC but have on 360, the experiences are totally different - If you like on hard that is, no weaksauce shiz as you can imagine - you will have alot more time to perform actions and prevent events compared to Crysis 1, The shooting is amazing - the selection of guns and customization in this game is pretty standard along with most shooting games but depending on whether you pick your favourite gun or a totally new one you're always going to have fun.2. The suit is a bit iffy now and then but that's the art of the game, if you went running around with stupid amounts of armours, health and whatever the ♥♥♥♥ else you could find the game gets a bit boring, i know... i've played this game on easy - sometimes it needs to be done.3. The scenery, I aint saying♥♥♥♥♥♥11/10 - Game of the Year!whatever year it come out. "

												I hear Crysis 3 has not done as well as expected and I'm not surprised after this effort.   It's a solid and very enjoyable game as far as shooters go.   Not quite the depth of story of something like Mass Effect or Bioshock but nevertheless keeps you interested.   Unfortunately though it suffers from some questionable design decisions and nasty bugs, such as:1. No quicksave - wouldn't be so bad if not for the following...2. Frequent crashes.   I'm not talking about the regular kind of crash to desktop - I mean reboot your PC crashes.   Worse than that it appears that the reboots are actually coded into the game, not caused by BSODs (I cannot even begin to describe how ridiculous it is that they never patched that).   I cant even begin to properly describe the frustration of a crash 3 steps away from the next checkpoint.3. Mods wont stay loaded. 4. Collectables and ""currency"" often go missing.I'll still give it a thumbs up because I am enjoying it despite the above issues.   I might even buy Crysis 3 if I see it on sale around the $5 mark one day. "

												Having finished Crysis 2 in its entirety I can honestly say that it is a decent game. However, it isn't quite as good as its the first game. Crysis 2 is very different from the original in both gameplay and mechanics. The game no longer feels very open as you're confined to the closed off areas of New York. You're no longer as in control as to what powers your suit can wield as you were in the previours game. The story continues well enough, but the characters seem way more generic and often boring. The graphics are still top notch, especially at full settings. A good enough game overall, and defenitely worth picking up at a cheap price.Final Verdict: 3.8 out of 5)			"

												Hmm. For once I was actually pleasantly surprised, well, only half way, but more on that later. This game is a pretty good game. Solid game. I don't really have a lot to complain about, which is a first. No control issues, crazy, huh? Aiming mechanics work very well. Cool experience overall. Good story. If there is one thing I can complain about, is that the enemies are very bullet-spongy, and I played the game on Easy, to enjoy the story more. They take WAY too many bullets than I considered necessary... But oh well, such is the nature of the beast, probably you would've blitzed through the game way too fast if the enemies took only 4-5 bullets instead of 20... The campaign itself took about 10 hours and it was decent. I kinda got bored through the middle of it but I'm not so sure it was the game, the game was like any other triple A FPS, I might just be getting bored of triple A FPSs in all honesty. Action-packed, waves after waves of enemies, the occasional QTE action sequence. FPS by the book. What really shocked me was when I tried to play some multiplayer after I finished the game, well the problem with that is... THERE IS NO MULTIPLAYER. At least no more, since the servers got shut down a few months ago and I didn't have the inspiration of looking that up before buying the game. So I was unpleasantly surprised when I got no piece of some MP action... Oh well, I'll just cry myself to sleep tonight and tomorrow morning everything will be OK. I do recommend this game, but don't expect multiplayer, since everything you'll get is a good campaign, and that in itself is satisfying enough! ;)			"

												If you enjoy unoriginal FPS games, this is the game for you. Shoot enemy soldiers, shoot aliens, play through a moderately entertaining albiet lacking in plot campaign. The graphics are decent, and there are a few somewhat innovative game mechanics. The multiplayer is rather mundane and few people are ever on. If you want a general picture of the game, think Half Life 2 with better graphics, less plot, less puzzle, no memorable characters, and more repetetive gameplay. If you havent played Half Life 2 or dont know what it is, GO BUY THE ORANGE BOX and save $10 while you're at it.6/10			"

												If you thought that it couldn't get any better than Crysis, Crysis 2 steals the crown. There may be some elements missing, such as prone, but this game make you feel like you are the predator from Predator. The AI has improved significantly from Crysis, but there are still some quirky errors such as enemies staring at you when you are right infront of them, or enemies that won't budge when a grenade is tossed at their feet. Forunately, these issues are not very common.Excellent game!!			"

												A real disappointment to play.  The first two installments never failed to make you feel like you were ahead of the curve during gameplay.  In this game I felt like I was constantly trying to figure out the storyline, choose weapons, configure controls and graphics.  I felt like I was trying to get the game to work properly - all the way to the epilogue.It really shows that this was developed for game-boys.  The port to PC just didn't feel right.  I started off trying to adjust FOV, and getting my controls set comfortably.  The AI was bad, I watched AI enemies chirp and bump and get locked into corners.  It really destroyed any chance for immersion.I found myself spending way too much time with the visor - checking out other weapon mods.  It seemed like playing the game was secondary to ""collecting award trinkets"".  The cut-scenes lacked detail of the overall story, and were confusing.  I just didn't see how this game tied into the original story line.  It was only after finishing the game and reviewing all of the videos, that I got a sense of what the story was.  Weird.I feel badly for all of the people who worked hard on the artwork and other piece elements of the game.  The whole package - when put together - was just bad.I wish I hadn't played this game.  Like so many sequels, this one did nothing to enhance the original.  But, fortunately, the original is *still* replayable.  Whereas this game was a struggle to complete the first time through.  I won't be replaying this - and I won't even try the multi-player.  I'm going to uninstall immediately and forget about it.			"

												Quite dissapointing at first, but the long campaign does pick up later on. Story is pretty lackluster, and no character is memorable. Graphics on the hand are truly impressive and the game runs very well. Unfortunately the save system is very poor and limits your gameplay options. Enemies are very agressive, and try to punish you for run and gun approach, but the A.I still has lot of bugs when moving around.Multiplayer part of the game has been taken offline, so don't be suprised when you can't sign in any more.

												Crysis 2 offers great fun. It looks amazing and plays very well. I do not know how somebody can give it low scores frankly. Nanosuit is probably the best invention in recent years in video games. It offers many options to play the game. The MP is also phantastic. Crytek kept its promise and delivered a great game. Definitely worth to buy it.			"

												I am a huge fan of Crysis 1, this was beyond dissapointing. I could have gotten past the bullet holes floating 5 inches in front of the moving trees, that used to be cmpletely destroyable in Crysis 1. I could have gotten over the fact that running around smashing the V key and F was far better than shooting the enemy.. I could not get over however the poor excuse for a vehicle in comparison to the first Crysis 1. This dumbed down console version should have been called something else entirely, for is is a mockery of a legendary game, a game I invested in completely and probably burned out my first gtx8800 to run the game on full settings. I cannot reccommend this game, and I feel no remorse for not even giving it a proper chance.Play Crisys 1, and only 1.			"

												I've played this game several times super soldier difficulty, first on console then on PC.  This is one of my favourite shooters.  There are many aspects that I love about the game (there are smasll drawbacks aswell but nothing serious).What I like so much about the Crysis series is their sandbox and unrestricted worlds (for the most part).  Crysis 2 however is a little less so.  You are confined to a set path through the city with closed-in walls instead of running through jungles like in Crysis 1 and or Warhead. It makes up for some of this during each individual battle which occurs in a pretty open area, so you don't end up ffeeling completely penned in.The suit's powers are can now be accessed with keyboard shortcuts. 'Q' for armour and 'E' for stealth mode. There is no sprinting or power jumps. Those activate automatically when performing certain actions. The suit's abilities can be upgraded.  Upgradability is neat, but not very integral.  You become able to upgrade it by collecting nano particles from aliens you kill.Although there is no longer any multiplayer, the campain will keep you entertained. An average playthough I've found can last from 6 -9 hours if you know what you're doing.  The guns and combat are as crisp and satisfying as they were in the first two Crysis games. When getting near the end of the game it is easier to stealth (and fast) than to kill everyone on the map. Dying can set you back annoyingly far so don't die.Overall, it is a solid game worth investing your time into with a great storyline and combat, you can't go wrong. "

But the amazing reviews and graphics with great gameplay impressed me from about ten mins into it. yes the start dragged and i found my self on my phone taking no interest. Then once jumping into the game i felt amazing, as if these actions that were taking place in the game, were better than the life thretening situation you would take in all of the call of duty games put in one. If you are looking for a fps with a different style, i recomend this buy, its fun and its cheap and holds a great experiance.			"

												3/5 Uh. What can I say about Crysis 2? I definitely didn't enjoy my time with this game. I didn't HATE it, but I struggled to finish this game. The plot got to be a bit too much for me, but I guess with super soldiers fighting aliens, how can you do anything but go too far? The environment is beautiful but now the game is a lot more linear, and certainly no longer as open-world as the previous game. There is also a lot more handholding, and the game tries to give you options to do things but there's usually an ""obvious way"" to go that is clearly the Occam's razor (am I using that phrase correctly?) and most simple and effect method of completing the current mission. With the exception of becoming a bit of a hallway shooter, the gameplay is about the same. Also there is a ""leveling system"" in the game where you gain levels by absorbing the DNA out of killed aliens. I found this to be a terrible addition because now instead of trying to save the world, I was constantly focusing on trying to remember where certain dead bodies were so I could go back and level up once I finished killing all the aliens in a certain area. One noticeable change is that you are no longer a secretive super soldier skulking around a tropical island uncovering a hidden mystery, but now you're in the middle of a chaotic war zone trying to stop an entire alien invasion. But the plot isn't what concerned me--it was just the gameplay was so repetitive and felt endless and exhausting. I kept checking my play time and I even looked up online the average time it took others to beat the game. I hated ""leveling up"" because it distracted me and I hated the linear paths to the ends of the levels (at least after experiencing the more semi-open world environments of the first game). No more sneaking around the entire map to flank the enemy from behind--now you just walk down a New York street and try to sneak behind cars right in front of the bad guys. That being said, the game wasn't terrible--it was just a lot of negative changes from the first game. The ability to upgrade the suit was a nice addition but poorly executed. Also making the game into a hallway shooter was also a bad decision. If you enjoyed the first Crysis, then this isn't the game for you.			"

												A very worthy sequel to Crysis. There's some significant changes to the formula to keep things fresh but some might not enjoy the new urban setting as much as the lush jungles of the first game. However, this game does a lot of things really well. The combat is satisfying, graphics are again top-notch and the new storyline is interesting to say at least. Shame it took so long to get back on Steam after being made exclusive to Origin (screw you EA) but at least we can add it to our collection now so thanks to the guys over at Crytek. Well worth a purchase if you liked the first game or FPS games in general.			"

												I loved the original.... i could litterally leave it at that and most fans of the series would understand.But...Pros: -Intence interesting story. Not groundbreaking. But its good         -Responsive controls, plays alot like call of duty but with ledge grabbing         -Lots of fun little extras like emails to and from your enemys or extra music score content         -Graphicly its alright tho i did find the origianal more stunningCons: -Short.... maybe 6 solid hours of gameplay not alot to stare at visually  and it is very hallway so exploration is                                           not rewarded with much other than the odd obviously placed collectable           -The powers are not ... great, i went through 80 % of the game without ever using any thinking the higher priced          upgrades would be game breaking, spoiler... they are not i noticed very little difference           - The weaponry is a little unbalanced once you get  the grendel the games basicly over it is by far the most               efficient and fast and powerful gun you will ever find. Conclusion: I liked the 1st and 3rd one wildly better than this game if its on sale and you want a run and gun skip every cutscene and shoot things in the face game then this is great. otherwise get the 1st one or the 3rd one you will like them way better.

												Maximum metropolitan mayhemLet’s get the obvious out of the way first: CRYSIS 2 looks great. You would expect stunning visuals from Crytek and they deliver here in spades. Alien-devastated New York feels very realistic as you work your way through the dust and trash that blows in the air. Much has been said about the fact that you have to work our way through the streets rather than roam freely, as was possible in the first Crysis game, and it’s true that C2 is less open-world than the original. But it never feels as though you’re being herded and there is some room for exploration within the confines of the streets. But even though this aspect is a little disappointing C2 is an improvement on the original in most aspects. The suit controls have been made far more intuitive and it’s now possible to upgrade it as you gather points through despatching alien invaders. The story is less nebulous than in the first and the action is far more intense, with barely a moment to take a breath at times. The set-pieces are more epic in scope and there’s a real sense of urgency throughout. Sadly it’s not a long game. I took my time but still completed it in a little under 20 hours. But if you like the Crysis franchise this game is a worthy follow up to the original, even though it doesn’t quite have the same overall impact. Now onto Crysis 3 … 4/5			"

The graphics and engine are amazing however and the A.I. is also good. Yes you are pretty strong since you can cloak. Most fps veterans should have no problem with this one.The multiplayer is also quite good. Nothing beats getting the epic Nano Suit 2.0 and running wild nearly invincible in multiplayer. It is hard to get, you need like 10 kills without a death or something. You can also get the ionstorm cannon strike or the helicopter alien gunship strike.Overall I give it a 9 out of 10.			"

												This game is full of cancer. Linear and lame story, PRESS F TO LOOK, motion blur, I can go on forever.But the worst part is definitely map design and stealth system. All the maps are abominable mix between sandbox and cowadooty linear- I mean, what's the point of putting *options* in itty bitty small sectors? After all it boils down to 'evade everything' or 'kill everyone and take stuffs'.Overall AI, including stealth system, is also messed up. As soon as you make a noise, get yourself seen, AI will notice and suddenly you get fired from eight directions. If you don't make your stealth kill really quiet and unseen, you will get warm welcome everywhere again. And watch out for baddies on mounted weapons- They see miles away, through walls. But if you get them to open combat, they suddenly become dumb. Dumb as rock. Wait, dumber than rock. All they do is hide, fire, hide, nade, rinse and repeat. That is, unless they start glitching and do nothing. Yes, that happens.To summarize, I feel that I've paid to eat someone's poop without expecting. I don't want my money back; Just take my rage and memory back. I don't want to remember♥♥♥♥♥♥ That includes you, Prophet.			"

												Let's start with the bad things: there's a stupid weapon limit and not much variety of weapons. The story is better than the average shooter story, but nothing to write home about. Crysis 2 dropped the open world of the first game in favor of a linear experience. Now the good: the levels, although linear, let you face your enemies in big open spaces, arenas, allowing different approaches to combat and letting you use the suit powers for maximum fun. The pacing is great and the battles are intense, the design of the arenas where you face your enemies is varied, making the battles play differently even though you're facing the same few enemy types during the entire game. The graphics when maxed out are amazing. Despite the flaws, I truly recommend Crysis 2. It's one of the best FPS of the last couple of years and truly worth playing if you're looking for action.			"

												Kauft das Spiel nicht wenn Ihr Multiplayer oder DX11 genießen wollt.Don't buy this game if you want to use dx 10 or dx 11 or if you want to play multiplayer.Ich habe das Spiel am 03.07.2014 gekauft. Es wurde die Unterstützung von direct x 11 angepriesen, doch das stimmt leider nicht so ganz. Nachdem ich nun alle Tipps, Tricks & Kniffe aus dem Steam-forum aber auch aus anderen Foren probiert habe muß ich leider feststellen das es sich nur mit dem Zusatz ""-dx9"" während Verwendung eines Cracks spielen lässt.Nachdem ich nunmehr geschlagene 7 Stunden mit dem Support von Electronic Arts telefoniert habe, welcher ja für Crysis 2 zuständig ist, und keine Lösung gefunden werden konnte um das Spiel auf 7 verschiedenen frisch installierten PCs und laut Support mit für Crysis 2 optimierten Einstellungen zum laufen zu bringen, erhielt ich eine Bestätigungsemail in der EA diese Vorgänge dem Drittanbieter bestätigt und auf ein Reklamation hinweist.Wie Reklamiere ich nun bei Steam?Fernabsatzgesetzt ist auch für Steam gültig, ok, doch da der Steamsupport mir leider nicht Antwortet, was tun?PS. Die MultiplayerServer sind mittlerweile fast alle Down.------------------------------I bought the game on 07/03/2014. It support direct x 11 has been touted, but unfortunately that's not quite right. Now that I have tried all the tips, tricks & gimmicks from the Steam forum but also from other forums, I am sorry to find that it is only playable while using a crack and while using with the suffix ""-dx9"". After I got off the phone now beaten 7 hours with the support of Electronic Arts, which is indeed responsible for Crysis 2, and no solution could be found to bring to the game running on 7 different freshly installed PCs and as support told ""with optimized settings for Crysis 2"" I received a confirmation email in which EA does confirm these processes to the third party providers (steam) and points to a complaint. So how do I complain on Steam? Distance selling law is also valid for Steam, ok, but since the Steam Support me not to reply, what to do?PS. Nearly all Multiplayer-servers have been closed			"

												From what I had heard about the game before picking it up, I didn't expect too much out of the game but I was plesantly surprised. Decent storyline and the gameplay mechanics weren't too bad either. Nice change of pace from the original Crysis games although I think it lacked a bit in some aspects such as enemy difficulty I did enjoy seeing some variations on each playthrough and when I came back after dying not having the enemies in the same spot. Worth the price for anyone who enjoyed the earlier Crysis games and recommended for those looking for another FPS to add to their collection.			"

												Beautiful graphics and lots of attention to detail don't disguise the fact this game is missing it's soul. The story doesn't begin at the end of the first game, and instead starts a new thread that is only very loosely linked to the original and ends with a damp bang. If it just had a narrative to fit the graphics it would have been a massive hit.As it is, is feels like a futuristic call of duty with aliens. Fun, but entirely forgettable.			"

												So I think the general gaming community admits that the original Crysis was not exactly earth shattering in anything but visuals- though the story was a lot of fun, the combat/mechanics acceptably challenging/enjoyable, and of course the visuals jaw-dropping, the original Crysis was not a /spectacular/ game.  But, it had coherency- you could follow the story pretty well, the characters though simple were likable, and the AI wasn't totally bonkers.  Enter Crysis 2.  Crysis 2 certainly lives up to its predecessor in terms of visuals; if you want to see post-apocalyptic New York City at its finest, look no further. But the storyline is, at best, confusing and at worst rubbish. I played through the game and then had to look up the Wiki to understand what on Earth I had just accomplished/done. You have a silent protagonist that everyone addresses by name, sort of like Half Life 2's Gordon Freeman but without the self-awareness. It's like they couldn't afford the voice actor they wanted and the studio said ""screw it, we'll make him silent.""  I recall in the original Crysis getting to use all of the powers of the Nanosuit with fair regularity; speed was great for escaping, armor allowed me to tackle a slew of guys at once, and invisibility was great for getting the drop on folks. Something happened with 2, however, as Invisibility and armor are basically all that you use, generally flip-flopping between them in an attempt to bewilder the already chilish AI.  The AI, I think, is perhaps the most disappointing part. There were times where I misjudged my energy levels and decloaked not six feet from an enemy... who simply shrugs and walks away. Characters running up and down stairs endlessly is a frequent occurrence, and in general I found myself bewildered at what my enemies would do next. Summary:  Crysis 2 basically only has its visuals going for it. A sloppy, incoherent storyline, unlikable characters, poor mechanics, and laughable AI serve to make the sequel to Crysis simply a crisis.			"

Seems like the developers really took alot of pride in designing the game, so they give you plenty of time to admire the spectacular maps and scenery. The game adapts very well to almost any style of player, while still feeling seamless in transition from the stealthy ninja to duke nuke'm. Overall very good game, especially since you can get it cheap now that 3 has been out for a while...			"

												Built a PC this gen and decided that Crysis had to be one of the first games I played. Picked up a copy on sale and fired it up to test out the new machine. The controls were a little odd to get used to at first, but once I'd gotten acclimated I had a blast with it. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous and the gameplay is pretty intriguing. I enjoyed being able to go on a full rampage with armor OR stealth around without being heard/seen.Stoked to play the rest of the series.			"

												Good fun but the weapons seem a little underpowered, near the end of the game you are using entire magazines sometimes or firing multiple rockets like DOOM 2 at enemies. They limited map sizes from the previous open world games as it went to the console market. Multiplayer doesn't work anymore. If you like crazy scifi action movies then you'll appreciate the story.

												If you like FPS games, you'll like this, because it's every other FPS, all at once.* You're the only survivor of your team, which is killed off before you're actually briefed on your mission.* You're special, because you've got this super armor.* There are soldiers, working for an evil corporation. In a shocking twist, you use their weapons against them.* Also, aliens.* Also, there's a horrible disease and the city is quarantined, using extremely brutal yet totally ineffective methods.* US flags fscking everywhere* You have to rescue some guy, who keeps giving you orders, and who somehow knows in general everything that's going on within a few miles of his location, but can't explain anything in detail.* Also, guy who needs rescuing keeps getting angry at you because you're taking so long, despite your near-death with the rest of your team, your having to travel miles on foot through all sorts of absurd side-paths, and your having to single-handedly defeat several hundred soldiers.* Hey, ammo cache! I wonder if there's a big fight coming up?* Hey, laser-guided RPG! I wonder if I'm just about to fight a helicopter gunship?* Occasionally, the game pauses for a bit of tutorial, pointing out that you have tactical options -- which are extremely difficult to actually pull off, and don't offer any advantage over the standard tactic I've used in every computer game I've played in thirty years, which is to work around the edges and pick off enemies in detail, because sneaking through the middle always means you just fight everyone at once.Uniquely, and perhaps a first for any FPS, CRPG, and for the entire meta-genre of speculative narrative, the horrible disease does NOT turn people into zombie. At least not so far -- I'm only a few hours into this game.The graphics are quite good. The designers are of the school of thought where there's incredible detail and extent, but you don't feel you can actually explore much. It's almost the opposite approach of Bethesda-style games, in which there's far less fine detail, but lots of time and space to explore.The game has several glitches. For instance, I often find I'm unable to switch between semi-automatic and full-automatic on my weapons. At least once, I had a scripted event fail to trigger. Both these problems were solved by exiting, and going back to a save-point.			"

												Excellent game.  Just plain excellent.  I WILL warn you, that if you are expecting an extremely free and large world (like the original Crysis presented), you are not going to find it here.  Crysis 2 tried very hard to boil down the feeling of freedom into much smaller areas while providing a game that has a much more 'on-rails' feeling than the first.  Having said that, the story is decent, the graphics are quite good, the action is fantastic, the suit controls are greatly improved over the original, and the choice of approaches to a conflict allow you some freedom of gameplay where the levels leave you a bit wanting.Exceptionally good game, overall.  Definitely recommend.			"

												Get ready to strap that Nanosuit on again, because it's time to go to the jungle of New York.Crysis 2 brings the beloved Nanosuit back into action, and improved in some ways. The suit's new look is fantastic, and the upgrades that are available gives the player more flexibility on how to use their suit. Whether it is for more stealth-like gameplay or more straight up shooting with a lot of armor, the suit gives the player a lot of fun customizable options that were not available in the first game.As for the story and setting, Crysis 2 takes place three years after the first game's horrific first contact with the alien race known as Ceph. Rumor has it that the Ceph built an underground hatch millions of years ago, and it is up to you how to save New York. The story is fun, although could be confusing since many of the pieces between the 1st and 2nd game are never explained. Rather, they are implied through dialogue. The setting is fun and interesting, and New York looks astonishing in Crytek's game engine.The gameplay is more linear, which is a big drawback since the first game prided itself on the open maps that gave players flexibility. In Crysis 2, you always move in a linear path and that's a shame really, since it doesn't allow the player to explore other interesting looking locations in New York. Yet, you still have some choices in certain areas, and the vast array of weapons at your disposal makes the gameplay quite fun. The AI is somewhat improved over the first game, but don't expect Einstein here, they will still make laughable mistakes. The game also becomes a bit challenging towards the end, which is a nice change from most FPS games these days. Last, some of the nanosuits functions such as sprint and strength from the first game are now automatic. Rather than improving those abilities from the first game, Crytek opted for a lazy removal of those abilities and made them automatic.The graphics are, just as the first game, fantastic. Yet I cannot help but notice that they did hold the engine back because it was marketed towards consoles. This sadly put the game behind its potential. Make no mistake, the game still looks great.The soundtrack is perhaps the best part of the game. Hanz Zimmer made the soundtrack and this automatically makes it awesome. But no, seriously, it's a fantastic and emotional soundtrack that makes you feel the desperation people feel in New York. Overall sounds are also great.There is a multiplayer mode in the game, but hardly anyone plays it today. In fact, almost no one played it when the game came out. The multiplayer is bad in most respects, and tried too much to mimic Call of Duty. They should have focused entirely on the single-player aspect of the game, not the multi-player aspect.Overall, if you want an FPS shooter with a crazy good soundtrack, fantastic graphics, and enjoyable story, then I see no reason for why you should not try Crysis 2.Score: 7/10 "

												I have mixed feelings about Crysis 2, the graphics are undeniable awesome and the story is just as good imo.However the changes made to the gameplay compared to the original Crysis have it's ups and downs. The speed and strength mode from the original Crysis has been removed and integrated as a passive ability, there is only armor and stealth mode as an active ability.This makes for a more seamless experience but at the same time simplifies the game. Not many will agree with me, but if we take away the suit powers it's an - somewhat above - average shooter.The suit upgrades make up for this with 4x3 unique mods unlocked by killing enemies, but you can only choose 1 power per slot. Maybe the developers thought enabling all of them would make the player overpowered, but it's a real shame not to have the option to choose all of them at once. The devs could always disable this in multiplayer, at least give us something unique in single player.Given these restrictions on the suit ugrade and the limited choices in power use, there isn't much in the way of upgrading the suit. I found myself rushing through the levels in stealth, because killing enemies was getting less rewarding as the game progressed on.I still recommend the game for the experience it can give you, but I feel like the combat suit upgrades could have been made better and the game doesn't live up to it's full potential.7/10			"

												You do not need to play Crysis or Crysis: Warhead to follow the story however I highly recomend playing them first, Crysis 2 picks up a little after the first game & continues with the main story. Main feature of the game is the Nanosuit that can heighten strength & speed, toughen armor & active camouflage. Solid story rich FPS, can't go wrong.9/10			"

												Now that I finished the game, I can say I like it. there where only fiew moments where I actualy couldn't go on because there was an enemy stuck behind a car or object, and my door closed because of it.I got a verry good laptop, and I had the grafics setings to max. I must say it was amazing. what I like the most of crysis 2 is you can often choose to go sneaky peaky or simply rambo.I like the shade between those two, run behind the enemy while cloaked, kill some unaware enemies stealthy, than plant some c4 behind some enemies, and go kabooom, then finish the level rambo style. I was a bit sad that there was no amo to be found for the gaus weapon and the swarmer as well, but allmost all other weapons where there with enaugh frequency.I give 9 out of 10 because of the above mentiont lack of amo and bug.yours, HERON			"

												i didn't expect it. but crysis 2 is a gem. Normally i dislike modern millitary shooters like cod and battlefield, but crysis has a very unique style. the graphics are still amazing, the soundtrack is very well done, the story is exiting, and there are even small BOSS-BATTLES! (the walker thingy's and the gun helicopter)-sometimes the A.I. does unintentionally funny stuff which can get you out of the experience, but overal its a 9/10. PLUS there is just something magical about hearing 'MAXIMUM ARMOUR', before storming a helpless army, that makes you feel like a futuristic half-god.MULTIPLAYER IS OFFLINE, BUT THIS IS STILL A GOLDEN GAME!

												They really dropped the ball with this one. From a pretty open and varied shooter with Crysis 1 to a linear abomination.The story was okay, they could've done great things with it but the presentation between the missions pulls you right out of any immersion you could've had.The only reason I kept playing it was because I wanted to complete the story.Not to mention an unnecessary registration system to play online.

												I know this game was praised as a graphical masterpiece when it was released and it still holds up extremely well as a benchmark for your rig.  It's vibrant with tons of effects and well textured throughout even if certain assets are reused over and over again (some of it can be immersion breaking but I thought think you're here for the roleplaying aspect anyway).It's a solid FPS experience with hours of content unlike the modern day shooters you see with a few hours, the campaign definitely felt lengthy and the storyline present.  The plot isn't something to write to your mother about but it's passable for the genre and even had a few memorable characters (though lots of blank ones too).The gameplay itself offers lots of variance in tackling objectives while spoonfeeding you certain ones using the ""Objective scanner"" by pushing B.  While helpful at times so it's clear what you have to do, some of this definitely took a lot of the challenge away and feelings of accomplishment on completing any objective or entire mission.Some of Prophet's abilities are a bit too strong as well such as Stealthing (which seems to be a common complaint among players) that it takes too much of the challenge away from the game but with the Ceph enemies using EMP pulses and the like - I found just enough variance and challenge to enjoy the experience.  It 'will' get repetitive to an extent but it overall was a pleasant experience with a large enough variance in weapons and secondaries.The A.I. is one of the few complaitns I have with the game - sometimes the enemies were buggy and multiple times during the playthrough - I found them clipped or stuck on terrain (especially the Heavy Ceph).  While this meant they were exploitable in a game that already felt a bit too easy.  Other times the enemies (especially Ceph) would just randomly patrol/pace back and forth while you were shooting at them - as if they were trying to decide if they should fight back or run away.Overall I wouldn't say it's a must-play game release but it didn't have enough shortcomings for me to warn people away from the experience if they are a fan of futuristic-tech FPS campaigns.

												Owned this game for the xbox 360 but had too many games backlogged so I never played it. Finally got a PC and this was the first game I played on it. Completely blown away with how beautiful this game looked. At time I couldn't help but to walk towards the edge of a cliff, rotate the camera, and just admire those monster graphics. Gameplay was solid and the controls are real fluid. The story was average but had some real interesting moments. The bar has been set really high graphically as I'm new to PC gaming. Highly recommend if you're new to PC or if you've never played this. Score: 9/10			"

												Overall crysis 2 makes up for most of the crysis 1 & warhead short comings. Controls are smoothed out making the annoying radial menu obsolete. We're no longer killing north koreans which feels a lot better. And gameplay can really allow you to play how you like. There are chavets though. Although I can't blame this game directly, Krytek simply dropped the ball on picking up where Crysis 1 left off. That massive cliffhanger at the end of Crysis 1 was never even addressed. Moreover, only one of the characters from Crysis 1 even returns at all and he isn't one you got to play as. Its like they decided to scrap almost all the story progression and start over. You never hear about the marines you played as in either crysis 1 or warhead, and the giant battle they are about to embark on at the end of that game (but is subsequently cut) is never even mentioned. You know that Prophet survives it, because he is in this game. But really thats all there is. At the very least we could have had an epic cutscene that wraps up that hanging storyline. But instead we start this game with nothing properly resolved. I found that to be extremely annoying as the best part of Crysis 1 was actually this (late to bloom) antogonist of an mysterious alien race. In this title almost all the rules are changed as to what these aleins are or what they do. The only thing left in common is the ice shard bullets they use. However, they are minimized and the whole frost/ice thing is replaced with a locus spore/disease cloud. This felt a lot like trying to pander to the zombie fanboys just to get them to buy the game. There are still the big questions hanging out there on why these aliens are now squids but maybe that will get resolved in the next installment. Given the history of the franchise, i'm not holding my breath. They are squids just because. Crysis 2 did a few things right as far as the story goes, this time around. There was a point where you see the final alien hive thing and you're in a helicopter flying towards it. This was the exact moment Crysis 1 abruptly ended, so I was expecting the credits to roll here... but to my surprise we actually got to land and have this last level. Even better you have the option to playing this last area as you see fit. I decided to do a stealth approach and only killed the 4 aleins you absolutely have to to trigger the final cutscene. If i went in guns blazing the whole area was crawling to the teeth with huge guns and huge aliens. The option to play it either way was pretty great. The ending was a bit odd but felt fairly well rounded. They wrapped up the NYC storyline and opened up the game to sequels with other ""infected"" areas around the globe. What was important is that at the end you felt like the whole game you were battling to save NYC and you accomplished that goal. That was a feel-good ending. I did find the changes to the aliens acceptable, but annoying. To expand... The aliens in the first game were very interesting, very dramatic and really quite unique. Although some aleins resembled things from matrix and other popular culture, these designs were tried and true. I found this fact charming, not bothersome in the first game. In this game it seems like there was an executive decision to make Crysis a sci-fi story that stood on its own feet. Although the end result was pretty good in the end, it didn't improve anything from the original. The whole ""squid"" theme really seemed forced. I felt like the fact that everything had tenticles from the aliens themselves to their guns and buildings...felt too much like the designers were like ""SEE THIS IS UNIQUE! WE ARE UNIQUE"" and I wasn't feeling it. To understand what this actually is... imagine if humans didn't drive cars but instead moved around in these crawling contraptions that looked like hands. Buildings weren't cubes, but instead all looked like human heads. This is what we get from these aleins here. Its too much. I feel like this game was over all leaps and bounds better than Crysis 1, even if it wasn't as awe-inspiring. Controls were great, upgrades felt meaningful and weapons ramped up in great ways. The story feels self contained and ends with the feeling that you've accomplished something, even if it is very obvious that it was trying really really hard to be a unique franchise. Over all: its a great game. Who knows about the next one, but its better than the first two.			"

												This game was a phenomenal improvement over Crysis 1. Some claim it doesn't include enough (or any) free play/roam, which is true, but there is a strict storyline to stick to. This adds to the fun in my opinion.  The campaign took me 16 hours to complete... needless to say the game has plenty of things to do without a free play feature.  Much more storyline, gameplay and quality than any COD or Halo game out today.  Although the multiplayer servers are shut down for Crysis 2, the campaign is so great it is definitely worth the buy.

												I have played Crysis on console since its release and wanted to play it on pc to see what all the rage about graphics is, and yea. The graphics are great and smooth. But it is always just a bunch of pc dribble to me as I could honestly care less about ""the superiority of pc's"". Yea superior at costing a whole lot. Aside from that though, this game on pc is great, but now lacks multiplayer which is severly disappointing since I can host games on my X360 just fine. It may not look as good but at least I have people to play with. The gameplay for this game is great. Fastest gunplay you can find period. The nanosuit technology is part of that speed and glory that no games really match. People have called it a CoD reskin or a pretty Halo. What a joke. Any shooter is by comparison a snail crawling to compete with the fastest paced gunplay ever created. To disagree means you probably haven't played online with a group of pros. Its truly sad mp is gone because Crysis 3 just made the game easier for n00bs to plays. Slower speeds when cloaked and a cloak hat is more visible in multiplayer. Nothing beats Crysis 2 and I would give anything to see it remade for Xbox One or PS4. Or even a server revival on pc, maybe even just the ability to host our own because there is nothing quite like getting your sh** rocked in a good game of Instant Action on Crysis 2.			"

(NY as the setting, c'mon, really?)- Weak, uninteresting silent protagonist.- Horrible driving sequences.- As mentioned before, the setting in urban NY isn't as interesting as the jungle warfare in Crysis.- Most of the time way too easy.- Terrible pacing at the start of the game, gets a lot better later on.- Shotgun reload animation locked at 30fps while the rest of the game runs wherever you want to.

They still feel sloppy to me, and i still don't beleive they look good. Push the system yes, but i still see a small glossy world with akward character models. GTA V is a pretty game. Ethan Carter is a pretty enviroment. Crysis trys to trick the mind with lighting effects and polished glean on weapons closest to the camera making casual players think they're looking at something attractive. My opinion though. and people will declare me a heretic for it. just saying - i've never overheard two teenagers in the grocery store talking about that crazy game of crysis they played the night before.

												Crysis 2 is a game which puts you into a futuristic universe from the viewpoint of a soldier relying on technology to survive. As true with all Crysis games, the visuals are phenominal. This game looks beautiful, despite it being released four years ago (at the time of writing). You're free to play any way you see fit. Want to take a stealthy approach? You can do that. Want to jump in, guns blazing? You can do that. Want to be able to customize your weapon on the fly? You most certainly can do that, too. Playing essentially as a supersoldier, you're put right into the heat of multiple conflicts. Even in times of crisis, humanity retains its selfish traits. You're up against an idiotic and unruly army, aliens, and even your own body, sometimes. Gunplay is fantastic with the variations you can create using the weapons and multiple accessories for each available. Not to mention, it's got a pretty nice cover system which allows you to aim precisely over a bit of protection just enough to get a shot in at an enemy. For an FPS, the AI was surprisingly good, I felt. Sometimes they coordinate attacks against you, while others, they may sit back behind cover and wait for you to approach. Play this game			"

Crysis was the only game that had multiple ways to accomplish your mission for many years, and is probably what made that ideology popular. I haven't reinstalled it in a couple years, so I don't know if this is an Origin install through steam - if I remember to check I'll update this review.Only get this if you like single player fps.

												I have mixed feelings about Crysis 2, the graphics are undeniable awesome and the story is just as good imo.However the changes made to the gameplay compared to the original Crysis have it's ups and downs. The speed and strength mode from the original Crysis has been removed and integrated as a passive ability, there is only armor and stealth mode as an active ability.This makes for a more seamless experience but at the same time simplifies the game. Not many will agree with me, but if we take away the suit powers it's an - somewhat above - average shooter.The suit upgrades make up for this with 4x3 unique mods unlocked by killing enemies, but you can only choose 1 power per slot. Maybe the developers thought enabling all of them would make the player overpowered, but it's a real shame not to have the option to choose all of them at once. The devs could always disable this in multiplayer, at least give us something unique in single player.Given these restrictions on the suit ugrade and the limited choices in power use, there isn't much in the way of upgrading the suit. I found myself rushing through the levels in stealth, because killing enemies was getting less rewarding as the game progressed on.I still recommend the game for the experience it can give you, but I feel like the combat suit upgrades could have been made better and the game doesn't live up to it's full potential.7/10			"

												Crysis 2 truly is a great game and easily surpasses its predecessor. With brilliant visuals (due to the power of the Crytek 3 engine) and a compelling story. This game is perfect for all who love action and good storytelling. It's a shame though that Crytek had to close down and that Crysis 3  (which, in my eyes, is even better then Crysis 2) is not available on Steam.Also the online-multiplayer is no longer supported, but I'm not that big of an online-multiplayer player anyway...To sum things up.Crysis 2. Great game. Go buy it :)			"

												The poor-man's Halo is back, though this time he might be considered middle-class.  This is a marked upgrade from Crysis 1.  It's still not quite as polished as it should be, considering the production value in other areas here.  The backstory is still mostly left unexplained.  If you were hoping for answers for the first game's questions, you will be disappointed.  It doesn't stop the game from delivering on present events, but the past is just as shrouded as ever.  Unfortunately Nomad is gone.  You're not told where he went or what happened to him.  In fact, only one character from the previous game is in this one, and it's the one who was mostly missing the whole time.  Go figure.  The suit's interface is much more polished this time around, with hotkeys available for the suit modes should you require them.  It's still an unfair advantage for anyone remotely good at stealth gameplay, but even with run-and-gun the game probably cannot be considered difficult on ""Normal"".  The game practically throws enemies and weapons at you, but you can actually skip most of the game since the suit is more efficient now, if you're so inclined.  The game threatens to break the very necessary bonds of its own ideas and concepts.  It feels as though at any moment you could break the game, if you so choose, so you almost feel bad and might alter the way you play because of it.  Pacing is erratic, but you are always given the tools to compensate.  Gone are the annoying godda** helicopters from the first game.  I experienced some weapon-mode switching and audio bugs towards the end of the game, but it isn't the mess that Crysis was.   Still pretty epic.			"

												I've played this game several times super soldier difficulty, first on console then on PC.  This is one of my favourite shooters.  There are many aspects that I love about the game (there are smasll drawbacks aswell but nothing serious).What I like so much about the Crysis series is their sandbox and unrestricted worlds (for the most part).  Crysis 2 however is a little less so.  You are confined to a set path through the city with closed-in walls instead of running through jungles like in Crysis 1 and or Warhead. It makes up for some of this during each individual battle which occurs in a pretty open area, so you don't end up ffeeling completely penned in.The suit's powers are can now be accessed with keyboard shortcuts. 'Q' for armour and 'E' for stealth mode. There is no sprinting or power jumps. Those activate automatically when performing certain actions. The suit's abilities can be upgraded.  Upgradability is neat, but not very integral.  You become able to upgrade it by collecting nano particles from aliens you kill.Although there is no longer any multiplayer, the campain will keep you entertained. An average playthough I've found can last from 6 -9 hours if you know what you're doing.  The guns and combat are as crisp and satisfying as they were in the first two Crysis games. When getting near the end of the game it is easier to stealth (and fast) than to kill everyone on the map. Dying can set you back annoyingly far so don't die.Overall, it is a solid game worth investing your time into with a great storyline and combat, you can't go wrong. "

												Quite dissapointing at first, but the long campaign does pick up later on. Story is pretty lackluster, and no character is memorable. Graphics on the hand are truly impressive and the game runs very well. Unfortunately the save system is very poor and limits your gameplay options. Enemies are very agressive, and try to punish you for run and gun approach, but the A.I still has lot of bugs when moving around.Multiplayer part of the game has been taken offline, so don't be suprised when you can't sign in any more.

When you cloak, AFTER your viewmodel becomes completely transparent, this helpful voice shouts CLOAK ENGAGED. When an NPC tells you some objective it repeats it in a much more obvious way. Blah blah Science Speak, collect the specimens... and in case you didn't get all that WALK TO THE PODS, GET THE SAMPLES.I name this voice Captain Obvious, and I'm still deciding on whether I find it annoying or hillarious.

												WILL IT RUN CRYSIS? That famous catchphrase known in PC gaming. As for Crysis 2, I'll do a two-shot review as I did played the game at release and now, two years later.1) So, at release, I would say I was totally disappointed with this game. Very consolized, lack of PC functions and worst, no DirectX 11 support. So technically speaking, the game was lackluster and underwhelming. Aside from the specs, the gameplay was also underwhelming as what made Crysis known was the more freedom of approach to the missions. In C2, it is very linear. Close to no exploration. Little to none ""driving/piloting"".What was even more irritating was the dismissal of NOMAD, Crysis 1 protagonist. Apparently, he got killed ""offscreen"" in a Comic, right after the events of Crysis Warhead.Release rating: 6.5 / 102) Now, having played the game two years later AND with the full potential of DirectX 11, thanks for the patch Crytek, I'd say the game is impressive. Granted I've got a better PC to enjoy the full high-end graphical options, I was amazed by the details as everything looked good! Gameplay speaking, sure it's not as fun as C1 but I got past my disappointment and did enjoyed the game lately!Current rating: 8 / 10PROS:-Nanosuit makes you feel truly powerful (a walking TANK with the .50 cal)-Gorgeous visuals with DX11 (post-release)-Cat & mouse play with enemies-Suit UpgradesCONS:-At release, no DX11-Noticeable bugs-Poor story-No recap of the story so far... wiki recap's it better!-No mention of Nomad and Psycho from previous Crysis & Warhead-Streamlined controlsCurrently, I do recommend this game for anyone seeking a decent action game.

												I only played this game stealthy, so I don't know about the gun fights and stuff like that. Stealth is really unbalanced. The skill you get in the first mission makes you impossible to be seen. Still a pretty fun game. Rewarding stealth kills, such as me choking someone who is staring into my cold dead visor as his last moments of breath fade away into the darkness which is my heart.... 6.5/10			"

												Now that I finished the game, I can say I like it. there where only fiew moments where I actualy couldn't go on because there was an enemy stuck behind a car or object, and my door closed because of it.I got a verry good laptop, and I had the grafics setings to max. I must say it was amazing. what I like the most of crysis 2 is you can often choose to go sneaky peaky or simply rambo.I like the shade between those two, run behind the enemy while cloaked, kill some unaware enemies stealthy, than plant some c4 behind some enemies, and go kabooom, then finish the level rambo style. I was a bit sad that there was no amo to be found for the gaus weapon and the swarmer as well, but allmost all other weapons where there with enaugh frequency.I give 9 out of 10 because of the above mentiont lack of amo and bug.yours, HERON			"

												This is a teen's FPS/stealth with its scenario, length and style.  It was as I expected from the comments.The goods are obviously the graphics, game options (combat/stealth) which is clearly identified with visor and not too complicated and few guns and suit options.  I really liked that you don't have to waste time looking around loots or go through tons of secrets.  The collectibles you can definitely skip with nothing to miss.The negatives are the length of the game with max 15 hours (maximum edition?? - but then again, short game is good so that you don't waste time), AI (silly enemies),  easy play in stealth, not too useful guns and suit options. The game says 'be weapon' where you cloak around all the way :)I didn't play the first and probably will not play the third.  It wasn't bad, I don't regret it - like RAGE or Deadspace for example, but it was OK for $5.   "

												I definately enjoyed this game. the graphics were beautiful, the AIs were decently hard, and the gameplay mechanics were very fun. I really liked the tactics approach to the game. Stealth is enjoyable, armor makes you feel badass, and some of the weapons were just plain awesome.My main complaint is the voice acting. Some of the characters *cough* Gould *cough* didn't sound very convincing, and at several times throughout the game the audio clips didn't match up to what was happening. Also, some guns are basically useless on higher difficulties, and on the flipside this game throws in too many (in my opinion) HMGs for you to use.Don't even try it if you don't have a good computer. This game is a beast.85/100			"

												Having loved the first game I was curious about its sequels. Personally I quite enjoyed this one aside from one annoying bug which stutters the audio in level cut scenes which is odd as once they are unlocked you can watch them from the options menu fine. They chose an odd storyline that whilst you want to know where it goes you don't really feel anything for the main character. If you enjoyed the first then you'll hopefully enjoy this too, after all who doesn't like becoming invisible and sneaking up on enemies. Side note: Why isn't Crysis 3 on steam, was this picked up by Uplay?			"

												Not that great of a successor to the original Crysis. The game shipped out with only dx9 capabilities, missing a dx11 patch, high res textures, and came with a badly optimized way of rendering water underneath the level thus requiring further resources than necessary for the level. The game is much more closed in level design than Crysis 1, so as to appeal to a more broad basic FPS market, and also ops for a mute, personality-less main character that you play as. While Cryengine 3 does look impressive, you can tell this was rushed in order to be released soon and to consoles. While some suit functions are nicely streamlined like running, and power punching, the drain rate on the suit and amount of enemies you encounter bring a rather pretty but somewhat boring FPS experience. Still, the soundtrack, modding support, graphics, gun recoil and level design is worth at least playing to see how you feel.Multiplayer is nothing to write home about and the running makes the game crawl to an incredible low pace.

Less open and more linear than its predecessor, Crysis 2 puts the emphasis on immediate action over free exploration, but does so in the best way.  Utilize the upgraded NanoSuit's enhanced functionality to weave multiple suit modes together, while upgrading its functions with ""nano catalyst,"" a substance left over from fallen alien foes.

												Get ready to strap that Nanosuit on again, because it's time to go to the jungle of New York.Crysis 2 brings the beloved Nanosuit back into action, and improved in some ways. The suit's new look is fantastic, and the upgrades that are available gives the player more flexibility on how to use their suit. Whether it is for more stealth-like gameplay or more straight up shooting with a lot of armor, the suit gives the player a lot of fun customizable options that were not available in the first game.As for the story and setting, Crysis 2 takes place three years after the first game's horrific first contact with the alien race known as Ceph. Rumor has it that the Ceph built an underground hatch millions of years ago, and it is up to you how to save New York. The story is fun, although could be confusing since many of the pieces between the 1st and 2nd game are never explained. Rather, they are implied through dialogue. The setting is fun and interesting, and New York looks astonishing in Crytek's game engine.The gameplay is more linear, which is a big drawback since the first game prided itself on the open maps that gave players flexibility. In Crysis 2, you always move in a linear path and that's a shame really, since it doesn't allow the player to explore other interesting looking locations in New York. Yet, you still have some choices in certain areas, and the vast array of weapons at your disposal makes the gameplay quite fun. The AI is somewhat improved over the first game, but don't expect Einstein here, they will still make laughable mistakes. The game also becomes a bit challenging towards the end, which is a nice change from most FPS games these days. Last, some of the nanosuits functions such as sprint and strength from the first game are now automatic. Rather than improving those abilities from the first game, Crytek opted for a lazy removal of those abilities and made them automatic.The graphics are, just as the first game, fantastic. Yet I cannot help but notice that they did hold the engine back because it was marketed towards consoles. This sadly put the game behind its potential. Make no mistake, the game still looks great.The soundtrack is perhaps the best part of the game. Hanz Zimmer made the soundtrack and this automatically makes it awesome. But no, seriously, it's a fantastic and emotional soundtrack that makes you feel the desperation people feel in New York. Overall sounds are also great.There is a multiplayer mode in the game, but hardly anyone plays it today. In fact, almost no one played it when the game came out. The multiplayer is bad in most respects, and tried too much to mimic Call of Duty. They should have focused entirely on the single-player aspect of the game, not the multi-player aspect.Overall, if you want an FPS shooter with a crazy good soundtrack, fantastic graphics, and enjoyable story, then I see no reason for why you should not try Crysis 2.Score: 7/10 "

												A good shooter game. However this, on its own, is not enough to make this game stand out from any other good shooter like COD or BF. This game is unique in that he has a special suit which grants him a few different powers for a short term. He can turn invisible, lift heavy things that he normally couldnt (like a big gun or kicking a car), or become tougher (which temporarily makes his armor super strong so that even a shot from a tank wouldnt kill you; though the more shots at you the faster this power drains). The suit adds that special flavor that i find many other shooters lack.			"

At first I didn't expect much from this game since I am a fan of its predecessor and knew how it was dumbed down for consoles not just in graphics but also in the mechanics and level design.Now that I've installed MaLDoHDv4 on top of it, I can pretty much say that it still looks very good to this day. The Leveldesign, although more tight than open world, is very good and there is more of a vertical combat compared to Crysis 1. Gameplaywise I was surprised by how good it feels. The mechanics, once you are used to them are just so satisfying. Moving, jumping, sprinting, shooting. It all blends together unexpectetly well! Storywise it's solid standard, nothing outstanding, but not bad either.Depending on the difficulty and your skill, you should get around 7-10 hours out of the single player!			"

												""Crysis 2,"" where Master Chief travels to New Vegas and encounters The Flood.I swear, that's what this game felt like.""Crysis 2"" borrows a number of tropes from sci-fi and sci-fi gaming, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It feels like Crytek was pretty appreciative and respectful about how they borrowed from other stories, and that's something I can appreciate.In terms of visual design, this offering is really quite impressive. The environments are huge and detailed, even though your traversal of those environments can be a bit limited at times. (Much like ""Crysis"" and ""Crysis Warhead,"" where there was a sprawling island in front of you...and lots of mountains or cliffs which prevented you from going too far afield.) What's even more jaw-dropping is the impression that all of the hugeness probably had to be built (largely) by hand. A natural environment lends itself to certain kinds of procedural generation, whereas a ruined city is something that demands much more manual crafting.Where the game does not truly impress is in how it all knits together as a whole.The story is actually a pretty good ""yarn,"" but the telling of it is a little clumsy and not quite paced in the right way. The acting tends to be wooden, and what really ought to come out ""in game"" tends to be rendered instead as exposition over ""cheap"" cutscenes. I call them cheap because most of them are just ""tactical overview"" videos or ""nanosuit rebooting as it struggles with alien strangeness"" sequences. In a certain way, the presentation ends up giving a person the impression that it serves mostly to cover up the bulk of loading the next level. It all ends up being a little disjointed, and there's no emotional core. Even when you do meet up with the actual characters in the game, they quickly go back to being little more than voices with Internet connections.The basic gameplay is pretty good, with you having to balance your suit's limited power with what you're trying to achieve. The stealth energy management returns to good effect, with you having to think about where you can get to before your cloak drops and you become easy to spot. The ability to customize the suit's upgrades to your preferred playstyle is a nice touch.However, the gameplay is only ""pretty good."" It's not stellar. The weapons generally lack punch, especially against the aliens. While this does encourage you to think tactically, it also tends to punish you disproportionately for when you inevitably do get into a full-on fight. Further, the overall lack of hitting power combines with the long spaces between checkpoints in an unfun way. Combat tends to be a relatively slow-paced, repetitive, hit-n-hide grind...which, if you screw up, affords you the opportunity to do that grind ALL OVER AGAIN. AGAIN.It's not like the ""Halo"" series, where combat was dynamic and entertaining - and even dying had an element of fun, because it tended to be so over the top. In comparison to that experience, ""Crysis 2"" feel like a chore. To be brutally honest, I was tired of the game by the end.I also have to ding the ""stealth kill"" mechanic. Coming from ""Far Cry 4"" and ""Blood Dragon"" to the ""Crysis"" series, I definitely felt that not having a takedown system subverted the stealth aspects of the game. When I saw that ""Crysis 2"" had added its own brand of takedowns, I was initially elated. That elation quickly faded, though, as I experienced how finicky and unforgiving the stealth kill system is. The radius for it to work is miniscule, with a very sharp ""falloff."" That is, it's easy to find yourself in the transition range where a tiny bit of movement is all it takes to change ""stealth kill"" to ""melee."" It's far too simple to end up doing something you didn't expect to do, and even if you do end up initiating a stealth kill, your cloak drops for the duration of the animation. It turns out that stealth kills aren't all that stealthy at all. You are very likely to be seen and ""lit up"" by the unfortunate enemy's buddies, which is a pretty dangerous situation.I DO recommend the game because, for its flaws, it's still an interesting way to spend about 10 hours or so. It's not a bad game at all - it just isn't a genre defining title, because it sometimes gets in its own way. I say, give it a shot when it's on sale, and enjoy the enjoyable bits.			"

												Overall crysis 2 makes up for most of the crysis 1 & warhead short comings. Controls are smoothed out making the annoying radial menu obsolete. We're no longer killing north koreans which feels a lot better. And gameplay can really allow you to play how you like. There are chavets though. Although I can't blame this game directly, Krytek simply dropped the ball on picking up where Crysis 1 left off. That massive cliffhanger at the end of Crysis 1 was never even addressed. Moreover, only one of the characters from Crysis 1 even returns at all and he isn't one you got to play as. Its like they decided to scrap almost all the story progression and start over. You never hear about the marines you played as in either crysis 1 or warhead, and the giant battle they are about to embark on at the end of that game (but is subsequently cut) is never even mentioned. You know that Prophet survives it, because he is in this game. But really thats all there is. At the very least we could have had an epic cutscene that wraps up that hanging storyline. But instead we start this game with nothing properly resolved. I found that to be extremely annoying as the best part of Crysis 1 was actually this (late to bloom) antogonist of an mysterious alien race. In this title almost all the rules are changed as to what these aleins are or what they do. The only thing left in common is the ice shard bullets they use. However, they are minimized and the whole frost/ice thing is replaced with a locus spore/disease cloud. This felt a lot like trying to pander to the zombie fanboys just to get them to buy the game. There are still the big questions hanging out there on why these aliens are now squids but maybe that will get resolved in the next installment. Given the history of the franchise, i'm not holding my breath. They are squids just because. Crysis 2 did a few things right as far as the story goes, this time around. There was a point where you see the final alien hive thing and you're in a helicopter flying towards it. This was the exact moment Crysis 1 abruptly ended, so I was expecting the credits to roll here... but to my surprise we actually got to land and have this last level. Even better you have the option to playing this last area as you see fit. I decided to do a stealth approach and only killed the 4 aleins you absolutely have to to trigger the final cutscene. If i went in guns blazing the whole area was crawling to the teeth with huge guns and huge aliens. The option to play it either way was pretty great. The ending was a bit odd but felt fairly well rounded. They wrapped up the NYC storyline and opened up the game to sequels with other ""infected"" areas around the globe. What was important is that at the end you felt like the whole game you were battling to save NYC and you accomplished that goal. That was a feel-good ending. I did find the changes to the aliens acceptable, but annoying. To expand... The aliens in the first game were very interesting, very dramatic and really quite unique. Although some aleins resembled things from matrix and other popular culture, these designs were tried and true. I found this fact charming, not bothersome in the first game. In this game it seems like there was an executive decision to make Crysis a sci-fi story that stood on its own feet. Although the end result was pretty good in the end, it didn't improve anything from the original. The whole ""squid"" theme really seemed forced. I felt like the fact that everything had tenticles from the aliens themselves to their guns and buildings...felt too much like the designers were like ""SEE THIS IS UNIQUE! WE ARE UNIQUE"" and I wasn't feeling it. To understand what this actually is... imagine if humans didn't drive cars but instead moved around in these crawling contraptions that looked like hands. Buildings weren't cubes, but instead all looked like human heads. This is what we get from these aleins here. Its too much. I feel like this game was over all leaps and bounds better than Crysis 1, even if it wasn't as awe-inspiring. Controls were great, upgrades felt meaningful and weapons ramped up in great ways. The story feels self contained and ends with the feeling that you've accomplished something, even if it is very obvious that it was trying really really hard to be a unique franchise. Over all: its a great game. Who knows about the next one, but its better than the first two.			"

												As the highly anticipated sequel to Crysis, this game definitely exceeds expectations. Leaving the island setting established in the first game, this one brings the player into a post-apocalyptic New York City filled with aliens and other enemies around every corner. The plot is similar to the first game, but the scope of it has changed dramatically. The player not only has to save the city, but the entire world too.The terrain has completely reshaped the gameplay. For starters, there is a lot more room to room combat. Secondly, the player will encounter a lot of street combat where checking the rooftops is necessary for survival. Lastly, the weaponry is pretty much the same, but how it's used has also changed a lot. For example, the player may need to rely on their pistol a lot more during a close firefight.For any PC gamer out there wanting to play a beautiful looking game along with great gameplay, this is definitely worth checking out.

												VERY linear compared to the first game and much smaller environments resulting in fewer tactical options... BUT, still very fun! Much more variety in potential game-play styles than your typical action shooter. Great fun for those who like to ""play"" with their enemies before killing them, or just want to play their own way.Want to play cat and mouse with your foes by using stealth to lure them into a trap before taking them out? You can. Or maybe you want to go armor mode and melee your enemies into submission without firing a shot? You can do that too! Or perhaps you just want to rip a turret right off its hinges and go guns blazing as what can only be described as being a BAMF... You decide... The controls are flawless, giving you a great sense of weight while still feeling fast, agile and most importantly accurate with every shot. The enemies can feel like bullet sponges at times, but it's more than understandable considering they're very technologically advanced ALIENS. You rarely fight more than a handful at a time and there are plenty of ammo caches lying around, so ammo never really becomes an issue. And who am I kidding, you're a bullet sponge too, so it all works out.The story isn't great but it does its job and gets the message across loud and clear. You are a walking technical marvel who has been chosen(by Prophet) to save the world from an alien invasion. Go do it!Side note: If you have the rig to run it, the graphics are INSANE just like the first game for its time. The amount of polish and spit shine in this game makes it really easy to feel completely immersed in the world. The sound design is also super high quality.			"

												I have mixed feelings about Crysis 2, the graphics are undeniable awesome and the story is just as good imo.However the changes made to the gameplay compared to the original Crysis have it's ups and downs. The speed and strength mode from the original Crysis has been removed and integrated as a passive ability, there is only armor and stealth mode as an active ability.This makes for a more seamless experience but at the same time simplifies the game. Not many will agree with me, but if we take away the suit powers it's an - somewhat above - average shooter.The suit upgrades make up for this with 4x3 unique mods unlocked by killing enemies, but you can only choose 1 power per slot. Maybe the developers thought enabling all of them would make the player overpowered, but it's a real shame not to have the option to choose all of them at once. The devs could always disable this in multiplayer, at least give us something unique in single player.Given these restrictions on the suit ugrade and the limited choices in power use, there isn't much in the way of upgrading the suit. I found myself rushing through the levels in stealth, because killing enemies was getting less rewarding as the game progressed on.I still recommend the game for the experience it can give you, but I feel like the combat suit upgrades could have been made better and the game doesn't live up to it's full potential.7/10			"

												everytime i launch crysis 2 i picked up serious malware alerts.  launched it about 3 times (with no alerts), then came back to finish the game on a rainy day a few months later and it wanted no part of it. maybe my firewall got screwed up some how but i'd stay away reguardless. in all honesty its not a good game. if the crysis games didn't push systems so hard i doubt anyone would talk about them. They still feel sloppy to me, and i still don't beleive they look good. Push the system yes, but i still see a small glossy world with akward character models. GTA V is a pretty game. Ethan Carter is a pretty enviroment. Crysis trys to trick the mind with lighting effects and polished glean on weapons closest to the camera making casual players think they're looking at something attractive. My opinion though. and people will declare me a heretic for it. just saying - i've never overheard two teenagers in the grocery store talking about that crazy game of crysis they played the night before.

												Crysis 2 is a game which puts you into a futuristic universe from the viewpoint of a soldier relying on technology to survive. As true with all Crysis games, the visuals are phenominal. This game looks beautiful, despite it being released four years ago (at the time of writing). You're free to play any way you see fit. Want to take a stealthy approach? You can do that. Want to jump in, guns blazing? You can do that. Want to be able to customize your weapon on the fly? You most certainly can do that, too. Playing essentially as a supersoldier, you're put right into the heat of multiple conflicts. Even in times of crisis, humanity retains its selfish traits. You're up against an idiotic and unruly army, aliens, and even your own body, sometimes. Gunplay is fantastic with the variations you can create using the weapons and multiple accessories for each available. Not to mention, it's got a pretty nice cover system which allows you to aim precisely over a bit of protection just enough to get a shot in at an enemy. For an FPS, the AI was surprisingly good, I felt. Sometimes they coordinate attacks against you, while others, they may sit back behind cover and wait for you to approach. Play this game			"

												Get ready to strap that Nanosuit on again, because it's time to go to the jungle of New York.Crysis 2 brings the beloved Nanosuit back into action, and improved in some ways. The suit's new look is fantastic, and the upgrades that are available gives the player more flexibility on how to use their suit. Whether it is for more stealth-like gameplay or more straight up shooting with a lot of armor, the suit gives the player a lot of fun customizable options that were not available in the first game.As for the story and setting, Crysis 2 takes place three years after the first game's horrific first contact with the alien race known as Ceph. Rumor has it that the Ceph built an underground hatch millions of years ago, and it is up to you how to save New York. The story is fun, although could be confusing since many of the pieces between the 1st and 2nd game are never explained. Rather, they are implied through dialogue. The setting is fun and interesting, and New York looks astonishing in Crytek's game engine.The gameplay is more linear, which is a big drawback since the first game prided itself on the open maps that gave players flexibility. In Crysis 2, you always move in a linear path and that's a shame really, since it doesn't allow the player to explore other interesting looking locations in New York. Yet, you still have some choices in certain areas, and the vast array of weapons at your disposal makes the gameplay quite fun. The AI is somewhat improved over the first game, but don't expect Einstein here, they will still make laughable mistakes. The game also becomes a bit challenging towards the end, which is a nice change from most FPS games these days. Last, some of the nanosuits functions such as sprint and strength from the first game are now automatic. Rather than improving those abilities from the first game, Crytek opted for a lazy removal of those abilities and made them automatic.The graphics are, just as the first game, fantastic. Yet I cannot help but notice that they did hold the engine back because it was marketed towards consoles. This sadly put the game behind its potential. Make no mistake, the game still looks great.The soundtrack is perhaps the best part of the game. Hanz Zimmer made the soundtrack and this automatically makes it awesome. But no, seriously, it's a fantastic and emotional soundtrack that makes you feel the desperation people feel in New York. Overall sounds are also great.There is a multiplayer mode in the game, but hardly anyone plays it today. In fact, almost no one played it when the game came out. The multiplayer is bad in most respects, and tried too much to mimic Call of Duty. They should have focused entirely on the single-player aspect of the game, not the multi-player aspect.Overall, if you want an FPS shooter with a crazy good soundtrack, fantastic graphics, and enjoyable story, then I see no reason for why you should not try Crysis 2.Score: 7/10 "

												The story is based about aliens taking over New York City and you have the advanced technology to stop them.This game is just amazing, if you love shooters and sci-fi then buy this game, i bought the game for 19.99 pounds and really you get what you pay for which is amazing graphics even on low and great action and objectives. The campaign is very story based and has many objectives and never repeats the same objective twice. Graphics are just amazing for a 2011 game that looks like a 2015 game on high settings, i could even compare this game graphics to real life, the game was created on crytek 3 which is a great looking software and available to the public just for 9 pounds a month.

												It's okay.  Linear city environment not as compelling as Crysis/Warhead's jungle, where the sandbox environment made every encounter approachable with whatever tactics you preferred.  The gunplay is just as solid, but the suit mechanics are dumbed down a bit since Crysis.  The A.I. is incredibly stupid and arguably broken.  You can snipe stationary aliens in the distance one by one and none of their buddies react at all.  On the plus side, the game seems to run smoother on weaker rigs, probably due in equal parts to the condensed/smaller urban levels (vs sprawling jungle environs) and lowered texture resolutions etc. vis a vis its console port-ification.I paid $5, it was sort of fun, but by the last 2-3 hours of the campaign, I just wanted it to be over.  Do yourself a favor and give this a pass unless you really need more Crysis.  Warhead is still the pinnacle of the series.			"

If there would be an option ""It was ok"" I would give that one. The game is really average. All desing is looking good. Action is solid but there isn't really something that you haven't seen before.			"

												Go save our world from aliens again as Alcatraz who got Prophet's suit from him.Story reminds me War of the worlds where aliens were burried on Earth for quadzillion years long time before humanity appeared, waiting for their time to come. And time has come.Played Crysis 1 and Warhed, so i was a bit stunned when i hop into Grysis 2. In bad way. Really small levels divided into even smaller sectors. In some moments game gave me heavy corridor-like feeling. For me huge downside after large open levels of previous two games in series. I really couldn't wait for finishing Warhead and moving to Crysis 2 for its city setting instead of jungle on carribean isle, but it was huge disappointment for me.Anyway - after finishing game i must say game is still good. Yes, levels are much smaller than before, but good old is still here - really depends only on you how you will get through levels. But it gives really different gameplay when levels are so small. It can be much more harder if playing stealthy to avoid enemies.Not bad AI, definitely one of smarter, they can hear you very well and they can see you even if you are cloaked if they come too close (they see 'something', not exactly you, but they will go investigate etc.).Badass super hi-tech nano-suit with previous four modes was simplified into main two:- cloak - sneak through almost anywhere unseen- armor - withstand much more damage to your suit like from enemy bullets or simply drop down from large heightsWhich can be limiting on one side, because there is no 'power' or 'speed' modes. Suit itself switches to speed/power mode while running/doublejumping. Anyway no more super-faar throwing of grenades in power mode like in previous games :(.On the other side you can easily do double jumps or run fast and stay cloaked or armored, just your suit energy drains much faster.Pros:- even more epic story and storytelling (much more cutscenes and context-clicking scenes than before) about saving humanity from alien race's raid again, but in New York- smart AI- even with linear story you still have small sandboxes (levels) to solve goals only on your own- beautiful graphics, but Crysis 1 and Warhead are still better with their trees and foliage, here is everything limited (visibility, levels surrounded by buildings etc.)- tuning possibility of your nanosuit- scout every area for ammo crates, enemies and points to hide- Maximum Edition includes DX11 patch together with HD textures pack (over 2GB of data)Cons:- more bugged than previsou games which had none - very often stuck/repeating sound of NPC's (both human and alien) or i  saw a lot of AI stucked behing doorway on corner trying to go through- definitely smaller levels with less possibilities- worse graphics than in previous games (mostly noticeable on grass/trees/foliage)- four suit vanilla modes simplified into two (less freedom during gameplay)ConclusionBeside my unavoidable comparison with previous games in series - game is still very nice and good and fun to play. Overall very good game (yet typical scenario 'go save our world'). I had wait some years to play it in desired quality, but waiting was worthy :). If you like sci-fi and stealth possibilities with sandbox play i'd definitely recommend it to you.			"

												I'm just gonna review the single player and multiplayer not the extra maps. First the single player is well done and interesting. The maps are not as big as the first game. The graphics and engine are amazing however and the A.I. is also good. Yes you are pretty strong since you can cloak. Most fps veterans should have no problem with this one.The multiplayer is also quite good. Nothing beats getting the epic Nano Suit 2.0 and running wild nearly invincible in multiplayer. It is hard to get, you need like 10 kills without a death or something. You can also get the ionstorm cannon strike or the helicopter alien gunship strike.Overall I give it a 9 out of 10.			"

												A good game, better then I expected but not as good as crysis 1. EA didn't completely screw this game over. The game isn't short but its not long either. The game was fun, the stealth great, the guns were nice, and the story was well told. The issues is that they took out the sandbox, the extra vehicles, and the challance. The AI were really dumb at times and easy to exploit. Still  a very good game but I will always think of Nomad as the best and crysis 1 to be one of thee best fps since halo 1.			"

												I always quite likes crysis 1 and 2, and now its in the steam sale for next to nothing, even better. The graphics as you'd expect are great, and yes people will argue it's got linear levels and a poor story, i don't really care. It's a shooter, it's there to provide action and a bit of a thrill, it's not an RPG. So yeah, I recommend this game and although it's not exactly a 8 or 9 out of 10, maybe a 6-7, it's better than some newer shooters out there that cost much more right now.			"

												Now, I got this on sale, but for the sake of criticism, lets just imagine this is back in 2012 when this game came out. ""OH COOL I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT GRAPHICAL MARVEL THAT CRYTEK CAN PROVIDE ME!"" says the pc enthusiast. Little did they know that this game came with so many false promises. Boring gameplay, little gun customization, linear level design, horrible story, sequel baiting. But this is a Crysis game right?! We buy this for the next benchmark in pc games. Nope, all that people got was ugly textures with MORE EFFECTS THAT AVATAR THE MOVIE. I beat the whole game, slowly and painfully so I could get my moneys worth, but with a 8 hour campaign, lazy tacked on multiplayer, this is easily the worst game I've gotten for less than 10 bucks. There is apparently a modding community, and after I spent some time looking for the mods, the only place I found one was in the community hub, a mod that adds Crysis 3's heavily advertised bow into the game. For the sake of your entertainment, please do not get this. Get the Crysis 1 or warhead, because they sound a lot better than this dissapointing mess. 1.5/10			"

												Standard FPS. The only really unique thing about it is you get a neat suit that has an armor mode that makes you a power house so you can destroy your enemies, or a cloaking mode which makes you invisible so you can run past all of them and skip to the end of the game. The soundtrack (which Hans Zimmer worked on) is great, and it definitely does its job in making you feel like an epic, badass hero. Recommended if you like first person shooters and you want to kill aliens, because the game doesn't offer much else. Short and fun for ~10 hours worth of gameplay.			"

												Personally I enjoyed this more than the first one, I thought the nano suit was simplified which made it easier to switch between stealth and armour. It's not as open as the original but there were still multiple ways to complete each stage, whether it be stealthing your way past enemies and taking them out one by one, completely avoiding contact or going in all guns blazing. Using my sapphire HD 6870 I was averaging around 50 FPS on extreme graphics whereas on ultra it was ~30FPS but would drop below 30 quite a lot so I played on extreme for a smooth game.			"

												Having loved the first game I was curious about its sequels. Personally I quite enjoyed this one aside from one annoying bug which stutters the audio in level cut scenes which is odd as once they are unlocked you can watch them from the options menu fine. They chose an odd storyline that whilst you want to know where it goes you don't really feel anything for the main character. If you enjoyed the first then you'll hopefully enjoy this too, after all who doesn't like becoming invisible and sneaking up on enemies.

												I went into this game without any sort of expectation and overall I had a great time playing trough the singeplayer campaign. While the entire game is very linear in progression, the real draw is the nanosuit abilites. You are able to aproach most situations in varying styles, from stealth, to sniping, or just blasting in with the armor ability. Having these choices made a fairly standard mondern shooter much more enjoyable.Another nice feature was the weapon customization you could do on the fly. Dropping a pistol silenecer on my shotgun, cloaking up, then taking out guys up close was incredily fun.If you picked this game up in the origin bundle and haven't played it, give it a shot!			"

												Thoroughly disappointing, console-hobbled sequel to one of the best free-roaming shooters ever.No quicksave or custom save, checkpoints only.Tiny areas combined with lack of custom save means there's no real possibility of playing the long stealthy game which was so fun in the first game, it has essentially become a cover-based shooter with no real option of playing it any other way.RUBBISH weapon sounds, all of the automatic ones in this game sound like playing cards in a bicycle wheel.  Tinny and with no power behind them.Having a points-earning upgrade system for the suit is nothing short of comical.  After how much you feel like a soldier in the first game this system destroys any possibility of immersion and screams YOU'RE PLAYING A GAME!  COLLECT SHINIES!  You might as well be Mario collecting rings (hehn) I mean stars.Yes, it looks quite nice.  There is little else going for this game.If you haven't done it then go and play Far Cry instead.  10 years old now!  And so much better than this. "

GameplayFor me, the gameplay in Crysis 2 is wayyy better than Crysis and Crysis Warhead. You can be more agile and plan your tatics faster. The maps are small, but the emotion is great.What I liked the most is tha AI. The AI in Crysis 2 is more intelligent than the previous AIs.I am not saying that Crysis and Crysis Warhead sucks, actually they are great. However, for me, Crysis 2 is greater.I don't know what kind of magic did they use in this game but, the graphics are awesome. The game is better optimized than the others.HistoryAbout the history, you will assume the control of a Marine named Alcatraz, who gains ownership of the nanosuit from Prophet. CryNet Systems has been hunting Prophet to take the suit back, but they don't know that actually Prophet has given the suit to Alcatraz.I recommend you to finish Crysis and Crysis Warhead before getting into Crysis 2, so you can understand better the history.1O/1O "

												Single player is boring, repetitive and feels like a huge step backwards to the first. No longer any free-roaming. Constrained maps and player abilities feel subdued. Aside from good controls and looking pretty, this game fails to do anything else. And MP is dead because servers are shut down.			"

												I know this game was praised as a graphical masterpiece when it was released and it still holds up extremely well as a benchmark for your rig.  It's vibrant with tons of effects and well textured throughout even if certain assets are reused over and over again (some of it can be immersion breaking but I thought think you're here for the roleplaying aspect anyway).It's a solid FPS experience with hours of content unlike the modern day shooters you see with a few hours, the campaign definitely felt lengthy and the storyline present.  The plot isn't something to write to your mother about but it's passable for the genre and even had a few memorable characters (though lots of blank ones too).The gameplay itself offers lots of variance in tackling objectives while spoonfeeding you certain ones using the ""Objective scanner"" by pushing B.  While helpful at times so it's clear what you have to do, some of this definitely took a lot of the challenge away and feelings of accomplishment on completing any objective or entire mission.Some of Prophet's abilities are a bit too strong as well such as Stealthing (which seems to be a common complaint among players) that it takes too much of the challenge away from the game but with the Ceph enemies using EMP pulses and the like - I found just enough variance and challenge to enjoy the experience.  It 'will' get repetitive to an extent but it overall was a pleasant experience with a large enough variance in weapons and secondaries.The A.I. is one of the few complaitns I have with the game - sometimes the enemies were buggy and multiple times during the playthrough - I found them clipped or stuck on terrain (especially the Heavy Ceph).  While this meant they were exploitable in a game that already felt a bit too easy.  Other times the enemies (especially Ceph) would just randomly patrol/pace back and forth while you were shooting at them - as if they were trying to decide if they should fight back or run away.Overall I wouldn't say it's a must-play game release but it didn't have enough shortcomings for me to warn people away from the experience if they are a fan of futuristic-tech FPS campaigns.

												Didn't like it, despite loving the first game. I found the smaller, more linear stages to be confining in comparison to the sprawling environments of its predecessor. What's the point of being stranded in an urban jungle if you can't explore it and are forced to go from point A to B with no way of approaching a threat from a different direction. They tried to address this by providing you with different objectives that allow you to sneak past enemies by going underground or by finding perch areas where you can snipe the opposition from but it still ended up being overly guided and constraining.I also found the story to be jarring and non-sensical, espeically since the game begins without a clear transition between the events at the end of the first game and the begining of this one as it begins with New York already half-destroyed with seemingly new types of aliens that weren't in the original game with no explanation as to what transpired in-between. We also don't find out why Prophet suddenly went rogue and was clashing with elements of the military, and the person you end up controlling and playing as has no voice and goes along with whatever he's told to do unlike the oppinionated and more believable characters of Crysis 1.I also found the sparsity of checkpoints (why remove quicksaves in this type of game) to be frustrating as you could go up against waves of enemies for a period of 10-15min only to be killed by a new, tougher enemy and have to replay the whole thing over again. I think the devs did this to try and 'cover-up' their linear environments and repetitive scenarios by artifically lengthening the game in this manner but it didn't work, I'M ON TO YOU SUCKAS!On the plus side controlling the updated suit is a blast: the new suit mode changes make more sense and it's fun to customize your suit (and weapons) as you progress through the game as you can do so seamlessly on the fly. However another gripe I had with the game becomes apparent here as you need dropped nano elements from killed alien enemies to upgrade your suit but these disappear if you don't grab them quickly enough. It therefore feels like you're being punished for setting up sniping perches and methodically killing every alien within the immediate vicinity as by the time you're done killing the last alien the nano catalysts drops would have disappeared from the corpses of your first kills. This makes even less sense as the game nudges you towards higher-vantage flanking positions to protect your human allies as they fight aliens but doing so prevents you from nabbing all the catalysts.6.5/10			"

												Totally boring game for whoever played and finished Crysis 1 on Delta difficulty.Pros:-didn't pay muchCons:-really annoying introduction-unskippable cutscenes (wow, look at the evil reddish soldiers. ""You gotta beat'em up! Don't use your gun. Just sneak upon them and maximum force the fist into them. done.)-undieability (just sit somewhere for 5 seconds and you are ready to beat up everyone. or shoot if necessary)-really linear gameplay (levels mostly same way built: one entrance. one exit. no alternatives)-unhandy controls. Why did you change the controls?!-unloved placed objects throughout the levels (level filling trash)-boring sound effects-too much blingbling special effects and HUD elements---> better play Far Cry 1 or Crysis 1.

It's a shame because the engine and design aspects are pretty great, with a solid feel to the control, but the weapons, story, and action feel uninspired.			"

   Another Crysis must play   Crysis is one of the best single player FPS ever released, if not the best, and expectations for Crysis 2 are pretty high. Having played the first game intensively I was excited about the second game and I was not left disappointed.GraphicsVery realisticVery detailed texturesGreat lightingSoundEpic soundtrackWeapons sound very goodVery good voice actingBalanceDifficulties all extremely well balancedPlay as fast as you want to - if you want to finish a level fast, you canGame helps you with tactics if you  needAtmosphereReal placesAmazing cut scenes in player view instead of loading a videoMost areas have no humans in them whatsoever, they're simply empty and yet you are told at one point that the city is full with people, really?UINano-suit extremely easy to use and get  used toNot able to save whenever you wantContentPretty long single-player for a FPSYou can replay the game since there are different ways of solving missionsCollectablesLevel designDetailed levelsThe levels are very diverse, sometimes you're underground, in sewers, in buildings or streetsSome levels are longAITake coverCall for assistanceNot many different types of enemies, soldiers or aliens and there's only 2-3 types of aliensWeaponsExtremely interesting nano suit conceptWeapons can be modifiedAble to upgrade nanosuitSome of the upgrades don't make sense in the single playerStoryGreat startAllies keep changingSadly no real final but rather a cliff-hanger for the next gameConclusionCrysis was an amazing game and so is Crysis 2. Unfortunately it is not as good as the first game and yet it still is a game that really anyone needs to play. If you can lower your expectations from the first game you will see that this is an epic game with great game play but also story and even addicting soundtrack. I would recommend this game to literally anyone even if they don't actually enjoy FPS games. Crysis 2 is very different and excels at so many things that it is difficult to even compare it to the average FPS. The  nano suit is an experience in itself while the story will make anyone curious. It does not matter whether you have experience with FPS or not as the easiest difficulty literally allows you to sprint through levels while barely shooting anyone. I have finished this game within around 7 hours but admit ignoring a lot of enemies or using stealth to avoid lengthy fights. If you are a fan of Crysis then you can safely purchase this game.This game was played at maximum settings on this system:Monitor: BenQ XL2420T[www.amazon.co.uk]GPU: Sapphire Tri-X R9 290[www.scan.co.uk]CPU: Intel Core i5-4670[www.amazon.co.uk]RAM: Kingston HyperX Blu 4x4[www.amazon.co.uk]Motherboard: MSI Z87-G45SSD: Samsung SSD 830[www.amazon.co.uk]If you have any further questions or are still unsure if you should buy it feel free to ask.

												Crysis 2 was overall a success. The storyline was epic and jaw dropping. So good I'd even read a book about it. The gameplay was no mere shadow the storyline either. It had an excellant twist on the nanosuit that gave you playfulness when you wanted it, and allowed you to deliver♥♥♥♥♥kicking when you needed to.

												Overall, I found Crysis 2 to be a much better experience than 1. I like that they integrated the suit's abilities into commonly used keybinds instead of the HUD wheel, which I really didn't care for. The graphics are great and some of the scenery is breath taking. Stealth seems to be more of a viable option as a main tactic - although be warned, some nanosuit upgrades make it such that ghosting levels (or most of a level) a very real possibility.The game does feel a bit longish, too. One of the criticims of 3 was that it was too short, but to me it was just the right length whereas 2 feels like it suffers from unnecessary padding (Oh no! Gould left his stuff back in his apartment - go get it!) Criticisms aside, it's still a great shooter that allows you to take multiple approaches. Many of the maps are great and - despite the length - many of the individual levels have great pacing to them.			"

												This is a teen's FPS/stealth with its scenario, length and style.  It was as I expected from the comments.The goods are obviously the graphics, game options (combat/stealth) which is clearly identified with visor and not too complicated and few guns and suit options.  I really liked that you don't have to waste time looking around loots or go through tons of secrets.  The collectibles you can definitely skip with nothing to miss.The negatives are the length of the game with max 15 hours (maximum edition?? - but then again, short game is good so that you don't waste time), AI (silly enemies),  easy play in stealth, not too useful guns and suit options. The game says 'be weapon' where you cloak around all the way :)I didn't play the first and probably will not play the third.  It wasn't bad, I don't regret it - like RAGE or Deadspace for example, but it was OK for $5.   "

												I definately enjoyed this game. the graphics were beautiful, the AIs were decently hard, and the gameplay mechanics were very fun. I really liked the tactics approach to the game. Stealth is enjoyable, armor makes you feel badass, and some of the weapons were just plain awesome.My main complaint is the voice acting. Some of the characters *cough* Gould *cough* didn't sound very convincing, and at several times throughout the game the audio clips didn't match up to what was happening. Also, some guns are basically useless on higher difficulties, and on the flipside this game throws in too many (in my opinion) HMGs for you to use.Don't even try it if you don't have a good computer. This game is a beast.85/100			"

												The Good:As to be expected from this franchise the graphics are fantastic. The game allows you to take on any scenario however you see fit, and the unique mechanics of the suit lend themselves quite nicely to this. You can sneak through an area undetected using your cloak to move from hiding spot to hiding spot, or you turn on your MAXIMUM ARMOR, rip a machine gun off its mount and shoot everything that moves. Both are equally satisfying, but my personal preference is cloak with a silenced shotgun and sniper rifle combination because of the fear and confusion it instills in the ranks of the enemy.The Bad:Quite a few bugs, nothing particularly game breaking but at one point I transitioned from a cutscene to a firefight only to realize I had no weapons and was promptly killed, I respawned and everything was normal again. The game is rather short, I beat the campaign on normal in just under 9 hours; better players will probably run through this in about 6. The ending sequence leaves much to be desired: You have a final showdown against 4 Elite Cephs, which up until this point the game had been foreshadowing rather well, however I found that they were easily disposed of by repeatedly melee attacking them effectively stun locking them until I beat them to death. This was then followed by a mundane QTE finale of you crawling along the ground until you throw yourself down a hole. Also, the entire game takes place in New York City, which became repetitive after a while.Overall: great graphics, solid gameplay, average story, bit buggy, weak ending; 7.8/10			"

I wish I could say this without sounding like the typical condescending PC elitist, but it's obvious that this was one of the games affected by a console cash-in.			"

												Part of what made the orginal Crysis game so interesting was the fact that it had wide open maps that could neatly accomodate any style of play.  Additionally, it allowed you to tweak minutae in a way that only a made-for-PC game can.  This sequel sticks you in boxed-in city streets, removes a lot of the customizability, and dumbs down the graphics.  As a standalone game, it's not terrible.  As a follow up to what I would argue is one of the best FPS games of all time, Crysis 2 is a big letdown.			"

												If you are looking for an interesting single player FPS with plenty of aliens to shoot at in a destroyed New York, this game may just be something for you! There isn't really something in which this games excells compared to other FPS games, but it will give you about 15 fun hours of playing in single player mode. And for $7.50 in a Steam sale, it is totally worth it.It does come with a multi-player, but as this game is already a few years old and Crysis 3 is out for some time, I'll doubt anyone plays it anymore.

												A lot of people put the original Crysis game as a massive tech demo... that being said:  I really enjoyed the original Crysis.  Jump High, Punch Hard, Run super fast!  I felt like superman gimped a bit.  The original also had a lot of open area to have fun and ways to approach/landscape to expore.Crysis 2; removed all the cool abilities.  No jumping, running, punching skills, and no open world-ish areas.   Just cloaking and armor in pre-designed combat areas.All that being said:  It is not a bad game.  I had a good time cloaking around and using melee (Melee is OP - I used it on 70% of all mobs or more.)  The city scape looked fantastic even if the close up graphics felt fuzzy.  The story wasn't half bad but it really made a leap from sci-fy to magical/spiritual in some areas.Some of the guns were fun to shoot and explosions were awesome.  However Melee was OP and I abused cloak/melee most of the time.  The AI was smart when you tried to engage in gun battles but they got pretty dumb when I was ballistic cloak/melee.Overall - a pretty good FPS game and sci-fy story; however I couldn't shake the feeling that the first one was better.

												Let's get the bad things upfront and be done with them - the main and probably almost the sole issue of this game  - level design and game design choices when you are put into closed spaces - like office buildings and other ""boxes"". The issue being - one momemnt you are a walking tang being able to kick cars into a flying spin, but once you get into the indoors- you can't break a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ window pane or a wooden door! No-you must follow a predetermined path. Those moments you understand that you are playing a linear, forced shooter, and it really steals the fun of the whole game- suddenly you are tank no more! Believe me - it really is silly, when you just took out a chopper, but can't get out of the building with large rows of windowpanes 'cause you are ought to get out through THE DOOR. It's a total BS...But thankfully - you are given more than enough time outdoors and they easily compensate those terrible and annoying moments of indoors. And then this game shines! If you love to feel like  a terminator - then this is for you! Detaching a turret and walking with it around and shooting from the hip while everything blows upa round you and ceph die in dozens -that's a feeling worthyour money! (but I wouldn't rate it a full 60$ experience, buy it as a bargain if possible)And you must accept that it has your classy 90's action flick elements like - alien invasion, conspiracy, and plots aunder plots and twists and turns so unEXPECTED and so on. But it ain't terbile while you don't think about it a lot and just play!Do recommend if you like simple and fun FPS shooters where being invulnerable is explained and makes some sense at least!			"

												The ruins of Manhattan here are how destroyed London should have felt in Mass Effect 3. Sadly, there are no hot alien chicks to flirt with. Or Biotics. Or Garrus. Or manual saving. God damned checkpoints; on hard difficulty I found stealth to be the least frustrating way to play this game. Otherwise you (read: I) die too fast too often and keep refighting the same battles, until it gets too tiring and you just use invisibility to avoid combat altogether and finish it. Strangely, there didn't seem to be the same amount of variety as the first Crysis. Fights became repetitive. Seeing New York in rabbles is cool, but overall it was a mediocre experience for me. Hard difficulty funnels your play style towards the quiet approach, lack of proper tutorial made me understand most of the mechanics and small touches only around halfway into the game - how to use which weapon and the advantages of your binoculars – and I felt no desire to explore the levels. There are collectibles, yes, but they weren't nearly interesting enough to encourage you to hunt them down. Nothing as engrossing as BioShock's audio logs, for example.If you want a shooter with a bit of a creative touch in the form of the Nanosuit and its abilities (cloak, speed, armor), it might be enjoyable. Even then, though, you get the gist of it very early on and the game doesn't evolve enough to keep battles exciting. If you're looking for a rich experience with captivating characters and an intriguing storyline, skip this one altogether.And if you imagine you're playing Shepard in London rather than Alcatraz in Manhattan, it both remedies a bit of the sour taste left in the end of Mass Effect 3 as well as makes Crysis 2's environment more exciting.

												I've had it on PS3 since release so I have put in probably 200+ hours that you won't see on my Steam, and well it's actually one of my all time favorite series. I understand a little bit of the crap this one gets for ""dumbing down"" it's sandbox nature, but in all honesty this is my favorite Crysis campaign yet (and yes, I own both Crysis 1 and 3 obviously.) Sure, it's a little more confined than the first, I still love that it feels like there are a good number ways to take on each mission, I mean I've beaten it probably 15 times with each time going differently. I just find it stupid that people have to say the game is terrible or nothing like the first when it clearly is the same dang thing, but with easier to switch powers (technically NO powers were taken away, just some combined.) I think the story of this triligy is super interesting, definitely way more so than other standard fps's out there ex. Call of Battlegears Halo Assault 29. Of course, the visuals are absolutely crazy, and on Crysis 3 especially, looking better than really any next-gen game I've seen yet. It runs very smoothly (if your computer doesn't suck) but really it's very well optimized for PS3 as well, so either or.It's definitely a great game, regardless of the people who want to shove their stingy negative opinions down others' throats. I say buy it for sure, if you want to wait for a Steam sale, that would be best since they took out multiplayer (just on PC) which is like half the game. If you like Crysis 1, and are not a close minded♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag, and enjoy some casual alien blasting with sweet powers and an interesting story, this is for you. If you're turned off by Crysis 2, give 3 a try. It's way more open like the first one, and has an amazingly beautiful style. OR you could be a stingy, negative, close minded♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag and only play Crysis 1 (or none at all.) Your choice. :)			"

												Sadly, as much as I wanted to really really dislike this game, I gotta say I had a good time for 10 hours.  Considering I paid rougly $10 for Crysis #2 (out of the package deal) I had a really good time for $1 per hour.  Crysis #1 is also pretty fun for the cost.  Also, I played this at the full-on most difficult rating and I can for really real say that there are a couple points in the game that are HARD and challenging.In the end, if you have the extra cash and want to have a big cyberpunk-like shoot-em-up... buy it when it's on sale like it is right at this very moment.  Otherwise it really isn't worth it.  Hell, you can buy and play the new Deus Ex (a game that is FAR better) for far far less.There really needs to be a third option for recommendations called ""Meh"".  If there was, then that would be my choice... not ""Yes"".			"

												One of the finest shooters I've ever played. You feel like a badass from start to finish, and the gameplay, while more linear than Crysis, is also more fluid and allows you to switch between many different tactics in a matter of seconds. The campaign is nice and long, and tells an interesting enough story to keep you playing, and the gameplay uses setpieces perfectly as a way of raising the stakes when s*** goes raw. Also, the graphics are still jaw dropping.			"

												I know this game was praised as a graphical masterpiece when it was released and it still holds up extremely well as a benchmark for your rig.  It's vibrant with tons of effects and well textured throughout even if certain assets are reused over and over again (some of it can be immersion breaking but I thought think you're here for the roleplaying aspect anyway).It's a solid FPS experience with hours of content unlike the modern day shooters you see with a few hours, the campaign definitely felt lengthy and the storyline present.  The plot isn't something to write to your mother about but it's passable for the genre and even had a few memorable characters (though lots of blank ones too).The gameplay itself offers lots of variance in tackling objectives while spoonfeeding you certain ones using the ""Objective scanner"" by pushing B.  While helpful at times so it's clear what you have to do, some of this definitely took a lot of the challenge away and feelings of accomplishment on completing any objective or entire mission.Some of Prophet's abilities are a bit too strong as well such as Stealthing (which seems to be a common complaint among players) that it takes too much of the challenge away from the game but with the Ceph enemies using EMP pulses and the like - I found just enough variance and challenge to enjoy the experience.  It 'will' get repetitive to an extent but it overall was a pleasant experience with a large enough variance in weapons and secondaries.The A.I. is one of the few complaitns I have with the game - sometimes the enemies were buggy and multiple times during the playthrough - I found them clipped or stuck on terrain (especially the Heavy Ceph).  While this meant they were exploitable in a game that already felt a bit too easy.  Other times the enemies (especially Ceph) would just randomly patrol/pace back and forth while you were shooting at them - as if they were trying to decide if they should fight back or run away.Overall I wouldn't say it's a must-play game release but it didn't have enough shortcomings for me to warn people away from the experience if they are a fan of futuristic-tech FPS campaigns.

												Decent but plodding.  Enemies are unusually tough, requiring sniper rifle headshots, stealth kills, or a steady stream of bullets to dispatch.  You move relatively slowly, too.  Graphics were nice enough in terms of realism but they had no emotional punch like those in Bioshock Infinite.  Crysis 2 does not seem to have any replay value.  However, the game is probably still worth playing at a heavily discounted price.(Just started playing the original Crysis and, wow, it seems much more fun.  Faster movement and kills, feels more free to roam around.  You can drive boats!)			"

												Standard FPS. The only really unique thing about it is you get a neat suit that has an armor mode that makes you a power house so you can destroy your enemies, or a cloaking mode which makes you invisible so you can run past all of them and skip to the end of the game. The soundtrack (which Hans Zimmer worked on) is great, and it definitely does its job in making you feel like an epic, badass hero. Recommended if you like first person shooters and you want to kill aliens, because the game doesn't offer much else. Short and fun for ~10 hours worth of gameplay.			"

												Crysis 2 is a convoluted Jerry Bruckheimer action movie poured into a video game, starring a dead-man-walking protagonist, who was almost literally poured into a power suit as he lay dying. It allows him to withstand a great amount of damage or to turn invisible, but not simultaneously, and only for a short amount of time. The suit needs to recharge regularly. Its abilities give the player multiple options to tackle obstacles and give a nice balance of strengths and weaknesses. Flipping the suit from one setting to the other is easy and fast, so you can stealth your way around in invisible mode and then switch to armor when the shooting starts. Just always keep an eye on your energy meter and retreat for a moment when the energy bar shows red.The original Crysis – which I didn’t play – was a sandbox game. It saw you freely running around an island in the distinctive powersuit, fighting aliens and humans. Crysis 2 moves the action to an overrun New York, in which people are dying from an infectuous alien disease, or from being blown up or shot, or from a combination of all of these things. The sequel is more linear, split into nineteen chapter that lead you through arenas filled with enemies. There are big action set-pieces, there is a rousing, synthy soundtrack and you get to be the one man able to stop the alien invasion. Just don’t ask me how you end up doing it exactly. I started to tune out a little as the well-produced cutscenes and voice-overs explained what I was doing and just focused on my next mission objective. The plot is a bit too dumb and a bit too dense.The Crysis franchise has often served as a graphical benchmark and even three years after Crysis 2 came out – which is a decade in game years – it still looks very pretty. However, graphics have a limited shelf-life given the always advancing technology, and the series is most likely to be remembered for the power suit. It does indeed make for entertaining gameplay. The pick-your-own-approach concept is still very much in vogue in game design, but Crysis 2 was a skillful early adapter. The game rarely forces you into one specific course of action, encourages you to switch things up and rewards you for it.As you enter each arena, your visor can give you a tactical overview, pointing out ammunition stashes, and showing where to head to ouflank, to ambush, to sneak by and so on. When I grew bored of shooting near the end – your arsenal is unfortunately fairly generic – I ghosted past the final levels mostly unseen, though the last one could easily have been a tough and epic battle if I had wanted to go that route.There was one final, tricky fight I wasn’t allowed to skip, but then you won’t want to avoid being lethal altogether. Because for both the rare occasions when you do have to go mano-a-alien and get up close and dirty, and also to make the stealth easier, you will want to upgrade the suit. This requires you to run up to aliens you killed, to collect the glittery cloud that hangs over them, before it dissapates. A bit morbid and a bit random, but it does require you to be tactical again, weighing the risk of running out across the arena against the glittery gain. But seriously, it glitters – how can you resist?Your enemies aren’t always especially smart. I remember being cornered, with two exits that ended up at different sides of the same group of soldiers. Rather than rush me, they stood staring at the exit they had seen me at last, meaning I could walk back and forth between the exits, picking them off one by one as they focused on the wrong exit. Some of the aliens are fast and hit hard, however, so even if reactions can get predictable and a bit dumb, you still face a challenge. Checkpointing isn’t always especially generous and you may end up replaying a lengthy battle or two. But if you start to get annoyed, you may be able to just go invisible and sneak to a new area. Even if you leave behind an alarmed army of enemies who see exactly where you are headed, they will not follow you to the next area. It makes no logical sense, but is an easy exploit if you just want bail. I also encountered a few amazingly resilient friendlies, just regular guys, who took on and took out strong enemies solo, as I stood by idly and invisible in my powersuit.Crysis 2 did leave me feeling satisfied, but not really wanting more for the moment. It’s not a case of overkill, but definitely a case of enough kill. I won’t be picking up Crysis 3 anytime soon. Considering that the reviews for this most recent outing were less enthusiastic than those for 2, new players may want to start with this by now cheaper predecessor. It is a spectacular and versatile blockbuster ride. (More of my reviews at: www.popcultjunk.com / Twitter: @PopCultJunk )			"

												As fun as this game is. It doesn't beat the first crysis. Sneakng around things is a good little challenge however killing someone on its own goes out of the question and the whole plot gets kind ruined (SPOLIER SPOLIER!) - When you play the 2nd part of the first mission, you see the dame alians and it kind ruins that feeling that something is out there but you don't know what and that you think it could come out at any secound, yeah that feeling died before it had the chanse to even come to life.I will addmit though dispite the disapointment in sneaking, build up and the questionable physics where you can hardly throw a can to the end of a hall way but you can kick a car half way across a parking lot, Its a fun shooter that gets interesting but nothing that really stands out, multi-player looks good... But its has died from what I hace attempted to join online games.I'd only really recommend this game if you want to find out what happens after crysis one. DO NOT START CRYSIS HERE, TERRIBLE PLACE TO START THE SERIERS. Its a good addition to the series, however it has lots of moments where they get you on the edge of your seat, however they tend to be eaither short lived or sometimes drag on, but still they do get you on the edge of your seatAgain like I said with the first crysis, there is an ""Easy"" difficulty but don't be foold by this, its still anything but, I feel like the game just doesn't have the same freedom as crysis did where you actually picked up guns and ammo boxs for ammo and that you could unequip your weapons and just bring out your hands, I thought that was a nice touch but I havn't been able to do that in crysis.SO, Overall I am not as impressed by this game as I was with the first one, HOWEVER. Its still fun, quite satifing. They could of had stupid zombies (if you play the game you'll know what I mean when you see the people around the city) they would of been an odd but nice touch. I wouldn't expect to make much of an online gaming experience but hey, you might find a few embers of a great fire! Story is much better in terms of length than it was in crysis where it felt too shortStill, after all that its only really worth about £7-£8 so when its on sale next bag it.			"

												This is, in my opinion, the best FPS that I have played so far. The thing I liked most about this game was that it required you to be smart about how you confronted your enemies. Sure, you can run into the enemy fire, blow all of your ammo and try to kill everything, but more likely than not, you'll die pretty fast and have to redo the mission. Rather, to be successful in this game, you have to be smart about how you take out your enemies, whether it be sniping them from afar, or stealthing up behind them and killing them. Crysis 2 is not as open world as the first one, which has both its pros and its cons. Overall though, a great game with a good storyline, lots of action, and lots of fun.			"

												The game is a generic FPS that deviates greatly from what made Crysis so good. It maintains the high graphical standards of the original but removes the core gameplay mechanics of Crysis. Its control scheme has been over simplified to make it more compatible with consoles and gamepads. while it insists on including a progression system that lacks depth or foresight.**SPOILERS**the nanosuit is practically non-existant with mode switches being automatic when you attempt a relevant action.The main flaw of the game is its progression system, perks are unlocked for a certain number of alien kills. It lacks forsight in that you will have all perks unlocked in about 1-2 playthroughs but it will be fewer if you are worse at the game because it counts all alien kills, even those you got and then died before proceeding with the campaign. also the perks themselves produce no meaningful change in gameplay. All in all if you're looking for a good game crysis 1 and crysis 3 are better than this game. "

I don't think it's the Best PC FPS,But,it's 1 of the best.And to complain about it's only a single player game,Is assinine.that's what it's advertised as.IF YOU DON'T WANT A SINGLE PLAYER GAME DON'T BUY IT.But if you want a good FPS game by all means you'll like this one.

												Even when this second part of the Crisys series isn't as good as the first one, it keep me playing time to time not only for the graphics but gameplay, after been played most of the shooter out there, I can say, many things should be improved in this game of course, but deserves to be played. Look for the ultra pack textures, it will increase the enjoy of graphics.			"

												The Crysis franchies is fantastic!!  Given its current price tag, don't miss the chance to get a very underappreciated game, it has a great story line, the graphics are outstanding and it's very high tech in nature with the super suite you get, it's a heck of a lot of fun.  The biggest recommendation I can give is learn how the various modes of the suite work and when to use each one.  The biggest bummer is that Crysis 3 is NOT on Steam. :(			"

												If you have been wondering about what happened after the first Crysis, then you will have some of your answers fulfilled. The game is not a knockout hit, but it is not bad either. It is a good FPS with a pretty good story. The suit controls are a lot easier to manage this time around too, and you have some extended power usage which I thought was lacking in the first two. If you liked Crysis 1 and Warhead, then you will like Crysis 2.			"

												Crysis two. (edited) : A game to be taken with a grain of salt.Didn't enjoy this game, it felt like Crytek tried to nook the console market, and as a result lost sight of what made the franchise interesting.The story is average, linear levels and the loss of the classic crysis aesthetics made this a poor continuation from the first game.Somewhat interesting ending, and a decent end boss fight.The weapons are the usual suspects, coupled with the Crytek engine's on the fly customization system make for some interesting combinations on the more rounded weapons, with simpler weapons such as the snipers and launchers having little to no customization. The multiplayer is essentially dead, and even then is unorigial and poorly balanced. A somewhat average roster of maps, with some good and some bad.The first crysis would provide with a more rounded gameplay experience, with larger, lush, open environments to play and experiment in.Would I reccomend this game? - No; there's just so many better things to spend your time on, from both a singleplayer and multiplayer game experience.

												I bought this game having thoroughly enjoyed the original Crysis - which was the right mix of tense espionage thriller, intense action, and open world exploration to make it one of my favourite shooters of all time.Crysis 2 seemed to have lost that touch.Although there were different paths through the environments of ruined New York, gone was the sense of freedom. The urban setting felt claustrophobic, repetitive and limiting - you could no longer go where you wanted, and I often felt that the designers funnelled me down set pathways with little scope for any creative approach.The story felt like nothing more than a series of stylish but linear set-pieces which you plodded through in order. Although there were moments of wonder, the plot held no surprises. I felt little attachment to the forgettable one dimensional characters who did little more than relay orders to you. The action was the only thing that I liked about this game. The Nanosuit v2.0 interface was streamlined and intuitive, the weapons were varied and well-balanced, and there were plenty of things to shoot and blow up in spectacular fashion. The ability to upgrade and specialise the capabilities of the Nanosuit was a nice touch as well, and imparted a little depth to the game.Sadly beyond that there is little else to recommend this glorified shooter. For those in the Call of Duty generation, this might appeal, but those looking for a little more depth might be disappointed.			"

												As the highly anticipated sequel to Crysis, this game definitely exceeds expectations. Leaving the island setting established in the first game, this one brings the player into a post-apocalyptic New York City filled with aliens and other enemies around every corner. The plot is similar to the first game, but the scope of it has changed dramatically. The player not only has to save the city, but the entire world too.The terrain has completely reshaped the gameplay. For starters, there is a lot more room to room combat. Secondly, the player will encounter a lot of street combat where checking the rooftops is necessary for survival. Lastly, the weaponry is pretty much the same, but how it's used has also changed a lot. For example, the player may need to rely on their pistol a lot more during a close firefight.For any PC gamer out there wanting to play a beautiful looking game along with great gameplay, this is definitely worth checking out.

Summary ReviewYou're an unstoppable machine that makes all your enemies blow themselves up because you're too much of a badass.Detailed ReviewObviously this game no longer works for multiplayer, so the only thing this game has worth is its single campaign.Synopsis----------------You play as silent protagonist, Alcatraz, a marine soldier who is sent to extract Nathan Gould, a former employee who has vital information in defeating the aliens that gave everyone the spook in the first installment. However, the situations immediately escalates for the worst and  the aliens kill all of your men. As for you, you barely survive the attack and a man by the name of ""Prophet"" saves you, and then everything fades to black.When you come to, you find yourself in the very suit that ""Prophet"" was in, but ""Prophet"" is now dead. He says in a recording that he was already infected by a virus, and says that you have to continue where he left off. And now the game begins with you off to save the world.----------------If this is your first time playing Crysis, I would suggest watching youtube vids of Crysis 1. It gives you a lot of insight to the story and (personally) makes the game a lot more enjoyable to play.I went through the game for 2-4 hours completely detached from the storyline only because I didn't know who was ""Prophet"", what the nanosuit was for and why I should even care that there were a bunch of Squidwards fighting against us. However, when I got to Gould, I finally took time to look at a recap, and the story became more enjoyable because of it.Granted, the story's not groundbreaking. It doesn't do anything too unique to stand out from most other storytelling games, but it was enjoyable enough for me to care for the characters to a small extent, which was more than enough for me to allow myself to want to play from beginning to end.As for the gameplay, it has its moments of being entertaining, especially at the beginning.You're given the option to do things that no normal soldier can do, which is being able to go invisible, have super armor, kicking cars on their side like it was some kid's bike and punching people in the face harder than a heavyweight boxer.However, this is also the game's weakness.Due to these features, the game feels too easy regardless of difficulty, and more than half the time, the enemies will make it easy for you, even when you're doing nothing at times.The AI is...special. They will shoot at you, and if you go into cloaking mode right in front of their eyes, they will immediately forget that you were even there.Their attention span is equal to that of a hamster. They will see you, and forget that you actually exist until you show up right in front of your face.Also,  I guarantee you that unless it's a mission where you're forced to fight, you can honestly just cheese through the game in cloaking mode without having to throw a single bullet, which really defeats the purpose of the game even being an FPS.But despite these flaws, this still doesn't deter from the game being fun at all. If you allow the game to, you can definitely get a nice kick out of the storyline. So is the game worth its full price at $30?No.Wait for a price drop if you really want to try out its single campaign.And when I say a price drop, I mean a price drop.This game is worth no more than $5 to $10 at best, and I wouldn't suggest spending any more than that, especially with the multiplayer gone.I spent $2 on this, and I say it was more than enough money well spent for my 12 hours of gameplay, especially with my purchase being the equivalence of a small time indie games.That said, this game gets a thumbs up from me.But be smart, and buy this game when the time is right.

												Fun game, but a few things confused me in regards to the invisibility suit power. When you're invisible, the enemies naturally can't see you; that's fine. However, your shadow is clearly still there and you would make noise when you move, the enemies don't seem to pick up on that. One more point, the throat slashing stealth kill I'm a little sceptical about. Unless with that stab you managed to cut through their spinal cord, they wouldn't die instantly. Simply cutting arteries isn't enough to ensure instant death, they'd be bleeding for a lot longer than the time that was allowed.Fun, buy it if you want.			"

												Crysis 2, you would think that its going to be ""awesome"" and that crytek would be taking awesome to the next level. Nope. Instead of a Non Linear shooter, you get a linear shooter. You get reduced suit capabilities, enemies at distance can still take multiple headshots before dying( completely absurd). I haven't finished the game, but I played throught the original Crysis, and Crysis Warhead a few times. While those games are hardly paving new territory in the FPS genre they still offer an unconfined type of game play.  Crysis 2 is the opposite, and in my opinion Crytek has had long enough to be able to offer a unique sequel to Crysis.As of now I'm not that far into the game, trying to find Dr. Gold (really bad plot advancer) and  for the most part since I'm playing on the hardest difficulty, I have to walk around in stealth mode ALL the time, which means I'm basically crouch walking through entire levels, because the enemies have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ unrealistic attention. This is basically how I play: Stealth, crouch walk, spot enemy, unstealth, headshot(repeatedly in some cases), restealth, crouch repeat. Wow thats seriously fun gameplay, totally not annoying, and obviously non linear and pushing the genre to new heights. Since I'm not but a few hours into the game I'm hoping that the gameplay expands a little bit, because right now its starting to get repetive. What happened to the orignal formula? You know what I would of liked to have seen? You have an awesome biosuit, that amplifies your strength and other attributes, how about  a complete melee, hand to hand option. How about super fast sprint that turns into a round house, or a super fast sprint into a haymaker, instead of slowy walking up to enemies for a LAME stealth kill. The options in combat are very limited and they really shouldn't be, theres no excuse at this point.What about using environmental objects for improvised weapongs, instead of just throwing them or kicking them? Like a pipe you can beat enemies with, or maybe objects to throw like spears etc. The suit should of at this point been able to combo sprint and jumps and other abilities. I vaguely recall what I think was a video from Crysis Warhead where the character was doing all this cool♥♥♥♥♥♥like sprinting very fast(because of the suit) then pretty much using the momentum from the sprint to jump really far, then some punching or something. There wasn't any of that in Crysis, or Crysis Warhead, nor is there any of that in Crysis 2. LAME.Obviously I'll continue playing the game because I ♥♥♥♥ing bought it. Would I recommend it? Uh, I guess.Edit:The game does pick up, or maybe I picked up the game play a little better as I progressed throught it.  I found the game to be a lot more fun a little while after I wrote this review. I think that maybe the gameplay with just the human soldiers is a little mundane a repetive, but once you get into mixed gameplay with the Ceph and also human soldiers it mixes it up a bit. Maybe I'll give it another playthrought to see how I fare again, and if its as repetive as the first time through, since now that I have a good grasp of the flow of the game and the suit stuff, and also weapons.Overall I will stand by my original review in the fact that the game doesn't offer enought new gameplay elements to really take it above its predecessor, but its fun once you get past the first segement of the game where you are just battling human soldiers.

												Crysis 2 is a game about a more horrifying idea of an alien invasion. One in which the aliens take a much smarter path in their invasion strategy and release a human-melting virus into the air of new york city, leading to martial law under the mysterious PMC forces of ""Cell"".It's an FPS, of course, but it does new things with the formula. The main hero, Alcatraz, is a man kept alive by a complicated nanosuit that gives him superhuman abilities. He can cloak, he has super strength, he can become mostly bulletproof and most of all he has one hell of a throwing arm. You can upgrade your abilities and weapons throughout the game to tailor your skills to your playstyle.The soundtrack is nothing short of amazing. Orchestral music done by none other than the famous Hans Zimmer, with songs that make just about any moment epic. There are many of these moments. While the game doesn't go full on over the top, there are many moments that are insane, whether it's escaping from a falling skyscraper or fighting a giant alien robot, the game is full of action and seems to be constantly trying to top itself.If you were put off by the first Crysis, I urge you to give Crysis 2 a shot. It's clear they managed to find their stride.			"

												There's no multiplayer option (I only noticed when I had read some comments), and it's ok for me. Usually I prefer to play the campaign, anyway. The game shows very nice graphics, even playing it not in the maximum configuration, a nice plot, very nice gameplay. The commands are easy to get used, and I do not experienced many crashes (2 or 3 - I have an Intel Core 2 Duo E6320 @ 1.86GHz, with a 4Gb video Card). Personally, I have enjoyed the experience and I'm planning to buy the crysis 3 (only not sure if it will run in my PC :D).I believe that it is fair to say that the game, even withou the multiplayer optioins (for those who lilkes to play in multiplayer), is worth.

												Beautiful graphics and lots of attention to detail don't disguise the fact this game is missing it's soul. The story doesn't begin at the end of the first game, and instead starts a new thread that is only very loosely linked to the original and ends with a damp bang. If it just had a narrative to fit the graphics it would have been a massive hit.As it is, is feels like a futuristic call of duty with aliens. Fun, but entirely forgettable.			"

												I went into this game without any sort of expectation and overall I had a great time playing trough the singeplayer campaign. While the entire game is very linear in progression, the real draw is the nanosuit abilites. You are able to aproach most situations in varying styles, from stealth, to sniping, or just blasting in with the armor ability. Having these choices made a fairly standard mondern shooter much more enjoyable.Another nice feature was the weapon customization you could do on the fly. Dropping a pistol silenecer on my shotgun, cloaking up, then taking out guys up close was incredily fun.If you picked this game up in the origin bundle and haven't played it, give it a shot!			"

												Short. Shallow. Predictable.  It's good for about ten hours of game play (much less if you don't bother with stealth much).  The campaign is not bad but never better than average.  Ripping big guns of their mounts and blowing people away is a running highlight.  The things are everywhere.  Wait for a sale.			"

												WILL IT RUN CRYSIS? That famous catchphrase known in PC gaming. As for Crysis 2, I'll do a two-shot review as I did played the game at release and now, two years later.1) So, at release, I would say I was totally disappointed with this game. Very consolized, lack of PC functions and worst, no DirectX 11 support. So technically speaking, the game was lackluster and underwhelming. Aside from the specs, the gameplay was also underwhelming as what made Crysis known was the more freedom of approach to the missions. In C2, it is very linear. Close to no exploration. Little to none ""driving/piloting"".What was even more irritating was the dismissal of NOMAD, Crysis 1 protagonist. Apparently, he got killed ""offscreen"" in a Comic, right after the events of Crysis Warhead.Release rating: 6.5 / 102) Now, having played the game two years later AND with the full potential of DirectX 11, thanks for the patch Crytek, I'd say the game is impressive. Granted I've got a better PC to enjoy the full high-end graphical options, I was amazed by the details as everything looked good! Gameplay speaking, sure it's not as fun as C1 but I got past my disappointment and did enjoyed the game lately!Current rating: 8 / 10PROS:-Nanosuit makes you feel truly powerful (a walking TANK with the .50 cal)-Gorgeous visuals with DX11 (post-release)-Cat & mouse play with enemies-Suit UpgradesCONS:-At release, no DX11-Noticeable bugs-Poor story-No recap of the story so far... wiki recap's it better!-No mention of Nomad and Psycho from previous Crysis & Warhead-Streamlined controlsCurrently, I do recommend this game for anyone seeking a decent action game.

												Part of what made the orginal Crysis game so interesting was the fact that it had wide open maps that could neatly accomodate any style of play.  Additionally, it allowed you to tweak minutae in a way that only a made-for-PC game can.  This sequel sticks you in boxed-in city streets, removes a lot of the customizability, and dumbs down the graphics.  As a standalone game, it's not terrible.  As a follow up to what I would argue is one of the best FPS games of all time, Crysis 2 is a big letdown.			"

												This game would probably be half decent if not for the forced mouse smooting and mouse acceleration. You can turn them off with console commands (everytime you start the game), and or apparently by adding a file to the root folder (which didnt work for me), but seriously, they couldn't add a ♥♥♥♥ing option for it? Or hey here's an idea, not add any mouse smoothing or acceleration, now there's a genius idea, because some of us 'crazy' people like the mouse to go where we move it, as opposed to having it wander around like it's drunk.I should add that if I had have known what a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥this game was to get working properly I wouldn't have even payed the $6 I did for it, seriously not worth it.

												Note: ive only played campaign mode .. i dont play onlineBest shooter game i've ever played. Lots of fun as you can constantly switch between steath killing and all out blasting. Most weapons can be equiped with a silencer and others are just so heavy and loud that there would be no point ... but they will tear enemies to pieces.Also the story line of the Crysis 2 is better and more exiting than most movies i've seen of this genre (and ive seen plenty). I think they should never have put money into making the movie ""battle: Los Angeles"" and just made this into a movie :).I recommend this to everyone who likes this type of game ... i rarely play games like this but crysis 2 is so much fun i have played the campaign over and over.

												Having finished Crysis 2 in its entirety I can honestly say that it is a decent game. However, it isn't quite as good as its the first game. Crysis 2 is very different from the original in both gameplay and mechanics. The game no longer feels very open as you're confined to the closed off areas of New York. You're no longer as in control as to what powers your suit can wield as you were in the previours game. The story continues well enough, but the characters seem way more generic and often boring. The graphics are still top notch, especially at full settings. A good enough game overall, and defenitely worth picking up at a cheap price.Final Verdict: 3.8 out of 5)			"

												Whilst playing like an above-average shooter, this game falls quite short of the original,especially in the multiplayer;The multiplayer in the first game was very open and expansive, much like battlefield 3, this allowed for full utilization of tactics and suit powers,However, this game has taken to a much more claustrophobic approach, feeling more like a generic corridor shooter.These critisisms considered, I have finished this game several times more than my playtime would suggest, and have enjoyed it each time, the single player is definitely the stronger part of this game.Buy it cheaper somewhere else.

												Watching the trailer, I have to say I'm a little disappointed. I love the Crysis franchise, but I can't say I'm excited for this one. The whole futuristic thing with robots and stuff just doesn't seem right in Crysis. I think Crytek needs to find that line between innovation and sticking to the Crysis formula that made this sieres so... awesome. I can see how some of this future technology would play well into kill streaks, perks, etc. in multiplayer, but I hope they don't go overboard. I'm gonna be watching for more trailers, but from what I see so far, I don't think I'll be picking up this game; At least, not for $30. On the other side, I can't wait to find out more about ZOMBIES in BO2. I do think zombies would be pretty epic with all these new futuristic guns and robots and stuff like that. Overall, I think that if Crytek can find that line between innovation and sticking to the formula, then they can use that platform to create some awesome weaponry and have some room to get creative. If they go overboard on the futuristic thing though, it could turn into a scrambled mess that is plain disappointing to long time Crysis fans. I guess we'll have to wait and find out			"

												The poor-man's Halo is back, though this time he might be considered middle-class.  This is a marked upgrade from Crysis 1.  It's still not quite as polished as it should be, considering the production value in other areas here.  The backstory is still mostly left unexplained.  If you were hoping for answers for the first game's questions, you will be disappointed.  It doesn't stop the game from delivering on present events, but the past is just as shrouded as ever.  Unfortunately Nomad is gone.  You're not told where he went or what happened to him.  In fact, only one character from the previous game is in this one, and it's the one who was mostly missing the whole time.  Go figure.  The suit's interface is much more polished this time around, with hotkeys available for the suit modes should you require them.  It's still an unfair advantage for anyone remotely good at stealth gameplay, but even with run-and-gun the game probably cannot be considered difficult on ""Normal"".  The game practically throws enemies and weapons at you, but you can actually skip most of the game since the suit is more efficient now, if you're so inclined.  The game threatens to break the very necessary bonds of its own ideas and concepts.  It feels as though at any moment you could break the game, if you so choose, so you almost feel bad and might alter the way you play because of it.  Pacing is erratic, but you are always given the tools to compensate.  Gone are the annoying godda** helicopters from the first game.  I experienced some weapon-mode switching and audio bugs towards the end of the game, but it isn't the mess that Crysis was.   Still pretty epic.			"

												After playing Crysis I was kean to get stuck into Crysis 2. The main difference being that this time we're fighting in New York. I felt that the action to start with was great to get you into the game. With the new set up in how the suit opeated as well as the feature allowing you to upgrade your suit, i thought it added depth to the game.The added extra of being able to perfrom stealth kills was also a great, allowing you to truely play the game as covertly as you can. This i think makes for a great game, the fact the player can choose to either go in guns blazing or choose to outsmart and out manouver his/ her opponents. The graffics are nicely done, and Ai is ranges from nonchalant in rookie to insane in the highest setting allowing it to be a constant challange.I would recommend this game, as a stand alone buy or to anyone whos played the origional and wants to try another title in the Crysis world!

												Umm... Yea... About this game. The gameplay is like running a tube with no options at all. The selection of weapons available is really small. The story was dry as was the overall gameplay. You couldn't even utilize your suit as you did with Crysis the first! I do NOT recommed this to anyone.			"

												Yay, same old skill based iron sights MP shooter, but this time with just a tiny gameplay mechanic that changes everything, invisibility. Yep, COD and MOH fans should have no problem getting with this. Oh, what is that, a campaign? The campaign is pretty good, with a very good story and enormous maps with various options. The MP is very worthwhile, so the game gives players lots of viable things to do. 8.5/10			"

												Crysis 2 was overall a success. The storyline was epic and jaw dropping. So good I'd even read a book about it. The gameplay was no mere shadow the storyline either. It had an excellant twist on the nanosuit that gave you playfulness when you wanted it, and allowed you to deliver♥♥♥♥♥kicking when you needed to. I personally did not play the multiplayer, but for the singleplayer the game was worth my time and money. Buy it.			"

												It was really odd at first how they had changed the way that the suit works compared to the last version of the game, but you get used to it. The storyline is great; it reveals the real truth of things that you did not expect at all. The only thing that was disappointing is the lack of destructive environment. We were supposed to have a world which you can put in smaller pieces, or even smaller if that is what you wish. But we were given a game which destructive environment is mostly scripted.If you are looking to have a game experience with quality graphics, interesting storyline or with interesting surviving in an environment where everything respects you(and want to kill you), then this is one of those games that you should get.

												Crysis 2 seemed to be an enjoyable, new, and innovative game, however this shortly wore off. I really wanted to like this game but as much as I have played I did not enjoy it as muchStoryThe campaign took my a total of 8 hours with 1 hour paused. The story was great but the problem was that there was so much unnecessary things that they added in. Literaly half of the game could have been erased and it wouldn't make a huge deal. The campaign was fun up until the third or fourth hour then it got repetitive and made you want to end this game as soon as possible. I kept saying ""Will this ever end? Why am I staying here and not leaving to save the world!"". It did pick up later then died again shortly afterword.GameplayHere I was extremely disapointed. It had seemed as if with the idea of the nanosuit that some innovative gameplay would come out of it. Sadly the game was still the old FPS point and shoot game with nothing else really. I actually found myself using the abilities of the suit to make it easier to kill enemies and avoid them overall.Performance and GraphicsThe graphics of the game are great except performance is a bit lacking. I was above recommended specs and still had to revert my resolution to play. I currently do not know if many people have this problem. In short do not expect full setting or high performance from an APU build or any type of integrated graphicsVerdict6 out of 10This game has potential but resorted to the usual FPS War Game genre, if some more cutting edge gameplay was added and the story were made more enjoyable this would easily be a 8 or 9Reccomendations    Buy if: You are a fan of all FPS shooters such as Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, etc. or if this game is on sale for $10/$15 or less    Do not buy if: You are deciding whether you want to buy it and it cost more than $10 or $15 also if you are not of fan of popular FPS games today			"

												With a reinvented combat system and overhauled narrative, you can forget about manually switching suit modes and everything about North Korea. This game now plays like a typical hide / shoot / advance fps, with stealth being less strategic and the occassional suit upgrade. While you'll miss the openness and gameplay variety of the originals, it will blow you away with updated graphics and extremely detailed environments. What Crysis 2 lacks in substance, it more than makes up for in eye-candy and the courage to completely reinvent itself.			"

												Crysis 2 is the best shooter since the first (70% of) Far Cry!I hate Crysis 1 and Crysis Warhead something fierce. The so called “open” environments only made the games frustrating, the enemy cheated, vehicles were impossible to drive well, alien enemies were unreadable, the power suit was crippled (too little energy, clunky interface hindered use) and the enemy soon had the *same* suit – thus negating all benefits. Yahtzee covered it well.Crysis 2 is an entirely different game. I’m stunned that this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ studio could produce such a jewel after all these turds.The setting (new york), the soundtrack (hans zimmer), the suit (more energy, smarter features and can be customized), the parkour (!!!) - everything is better. It's an audiovisual delight, controls like a boss and there were more levels that I desperately wan't to replay than I can even remember.If you like FPS and have a machine (and speakers!) to pull it of; don't miss out on this one!

												Kauft das Spiel nicht wenn Ihr Multiplayer oder DX11 genießen wollt.Don't buy this game if you want to use dx 10 or dx 11 or if you want to play multiplayer.Ich habe das Spiel am 03.07.2014 gekauft. Es wurde die Unterstützung von direct x 11 angepriesen, doch das stimmt leider nicht so ganz. Nachdem ich nun alle Tipps, Tricks & Kniffe aus dem Steam-forum aber auch aus anderen Foren probiert habe muß ich leider feststellen das es sich nur mit dem Zusatz ""-dx9"" während Verwendung eines Cracks spielen lässt.Nachdem ich nunmehr geschlagene 7 Stunden mit dem Support von Electronic Arts telefoniert habe, welcher ja für Crysis 2 zuständig ist, und keine Lösung gefunden werden konnte um das Spiel auf 7 verschiedenen frisch installierten PCs und laut Support mit für Crysis 2 optimierten Einstellungen zum laufen zu bringen, erhielt ich eine Bestätigungsemail in der EA diese Vorgänge dem Drittanbieter bestätigt und auf ein Reklamation hinweist.Wie Reklamiere ich nun bei Steam?Fernabsatzgesetzt ist auch für Steam gültig, ok, doch da der Steamsupport mir leider nicht Antwortet, was tun?PS. Die MultiplayerServer sind mittlerweile fast alle Down.------------------------------I bought the game on 07/03/2014. It support direct x 11 has been touted, but unfortunately that's not quite right.

After I got off the phone now beaten 7 hours with the support of Electronic Arts, which is indeed responsible for Crysis 2, and no solution could be found to bring to the game running on 7 different freshly installed PCs and as support told ""with optimized settings for Crysis 2"" I received a confirmation email in which EA does confirm these processes to the third party providers (steam) and points to a complaint. So how do I complain on Steam? Distance selling law is also valid for Steam, ok, but since the Steam Support me not to reply, what to do?PS. Nearly all Multiplayer-servers have been closed			"

												Sadly, as much as I wanted to really really dislike this game, I gotta say I had a good time for 10 hours.  Considering I paid rougly $10 for Crysis #2 (out of the package deal) I had a really good time for $1 per hour.  Crysis #1 is also pretty fun for the cost.  Also, I played this at the full-on most difficult rating and I can for really real say that there are a couple points in the game that are HARD and challenging.In the end, if you have the extra cash and want to have a big cyberpunk-like shoot-em-up... buy it when it's on sale like it is right at this very moment.  Otherwise it really isn't worth it.  Hell, you can buy and play the new Deus Ex (a game that is FAR better) for far far less.There really needs to be a third option for recommendations called ""Meh"".  If there was, then that would be my choice... not ""Yes"".			"

												I've had it on PS3 since release so I have put in probably 200+ hours that you won't see on my Steam, and well it's actually one of my all time favorite series. I understand a little bit of the crap this one gets for ""dumbing down"" it's sandbox nature, but in all honesty this is my favorite Crysis campaign yet (and yes, I own both Crysis 1 and 3 obviously.) Sure, it's a little more confined than the first, I still love that it feels like there are a good number ways to take on each mission, I mean I've beaten it probably 15 times with each time going differently. I just find it stupid that people have to say the game is terrible or nothing like the first when it clearly is the same dang thing, but with easier to switch powers (technically NO powers were taken away, just some combined.) I think the story of this triligy is super interesting, definitely way more so than other standard fps's out there ex. Call of Battlegears Halo Assault 29. Of course, the visuals are absolutely crazy, and on Crysis 3 especially, looking better than really any next-gen game I've seen yet. It runs very smoothly (if your computer doesn't suck) but really it's very well optimized for PS3 as well, so either or.It's definitely a great game, regardless of the people who want to shove their stingy negative opinions down others' throats. I say buy it for sure, if you want to wait for a Steam sale, that would be best since they took out multiplayer (just on PC) which is like half the game. If you like Crysis 1, and are not a close minded♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag, and enjoy some casual alien blasting with sweet powers and an interesting story, this is for you. If you're turned off by Crysis 2, give 3 a try. It's way more open like the first one, and has an amazingly beautiful style. OR you could be a stingy, negative, close minded♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag and only play Crysis 1 (or none at all.) Your choice. :)			"

												An incredibly pretty game.  Gameplay is OK, but I basically skipped a good half of the enemies just stealthing through anything I didn't feel like killing.  The endgame was thus rendered completely anticlimactic.If I was a good player I'm sure there would be some awesome combos of stealth kill, choke a ♥♥♥♥♥, throw an explosive canister at someone and blow it up, jump up a ledge and escape.  But I'm not, so I just shot people in the head silently from across the map.Worth playing at least once for the oh my god shiny.			"

												Crysis 2's jump from the setting of a jungle island to the streets of New York might be its greatest downfall, but actually being able to run the game on decent settings without lag and stuttering is a plus for the franchise. The concrete jungle never manages to be as interesting as the first games jungle settings. Weapons are a lot of fun to use, with on-the-fly customization. Playing the game with a silenced sniper and use of the nanosuits camoflauge makes for some fun stealth kills. Most encounters can be tackled in any maner that you choose, but they all feel so much smaller than some of the giant levels of the first Crysis, and you will find yourself feeling boxed in comparatively. Aliens are still uninteresting to fight, but in a very different way from Crysis 1. All in all, it was a fun shooter, with plenty of fun encounters, but overall it falls short of its predecesor.			"

												A deep, coarse, and slightly spooky voice comes standard with every nanosuit's default HUD and notification system. When you cloak, AFTER your viewmodel becomes completely transparent, this helpful voice shouts CLOAK ENGAGED. When an NPC tells you some objective it repeats it in a much more obvious way. Blah blah Science Speak, collect the specimens... and in case you didn't get all that WALK TO THE PODS, GET THE SAMPLES.I name this voice Captain Obvious, and I'm still deciding on whether I find it annoying or hillarious.

   Another Crysis must play   Crysis is one of the best single player FPS ever released, if not the best, and expectations for Crysis 2 are pretty high. Having played the first game intensively I was excited about the second game and I was not left disappointed.GraphicsVery realisticVery detailed texturesGreat lightingSoundEpic soundtrackWeapons sound very goodVery good voice actingBalanceDifficulties all extremely well balancedPlay as fast as you want to - if you want to finish a level fast, you canGame helps you with tactics if you  needAtmosphereReal placesAmazing cut scenes in player view instead of loading a videoMost areas have no humans in them whatsoever, they're simply empty and yet you are told at one point that the city is full with people, really?UINano-suit extremely easy to use and get  used toNot able to save whenever you wantContentPretty long single-player for a FPSYou can replay the game since there are different ways of solving missionsCollectablesLevel designDetailed levelsThe levels are very diverse, sometimes you're underground, in sewers, in buildings or streetsSome levels are longAITake coverCall for assistanceNot many different types of enemies, soldiers or aliens and there's only 2-3 types of aliensWeaponsExtremely interesting nano suit conceptWeapons can be modifiedAble to upgrade nanosuitSome of the upgrades don't make sense in the single playerStoryGreat startAllies keep changingSadly no real final but rather a cliff-hanger for the next gameConclusionCrysis was an amazing game and so is Crysis 2. Unfortunately it is not as good as the first game and yet it still is a game that really anyone needs to play. If you can lower your expectations from the first game you will see that this is an epic game with great game play but also story and even addicting soundtrack. I would recommend this game to literally anyone even if they don't actually enjoy FPS games. Crysis 2 is very different and excels at so many things that it is difficult to even compare it to the average FPS. The  nano suit is an experience in itself while the story will make anyone curious. It does not matter whether you have experience with FPS or not as the easiest difficulty literally allows you to sprint through levels while barely shooting anyone. I have finished this game within around 7 hours but admit ignoring a lot of enemies or using stealth to avoid lengthy fights. If you are a fan of Crysis then you can safely purchase this game.This game was played at maximum settings on this system:Monitor: BenQ XL2420T[www.amazon.co.uk]GPU: Sapphire Tri-X R9 290[www.scan.co.uk]CPU: Intel Core i5-4670[www.amazon.co.uk]RAM: Kingston HyperX Blu 4x4[www.amazon.co.uk]Motherboard: MSI Z87-G45SSD: Samsung SSD 830[www.amazon.co.uk]If you have any further questions or are still unsure if you should buy it feel free to ask.

Summary ReviewYou're an unstoppable machine that makes all your enemies blow themselves up because you're too much of a badass.Detailed ReviewObviously this game no longer works for multiplayer, so the only thing this game has worth is its single campaign.Synopsis----------------You play as silent protagonist, Alcatraz, a marine soldier who is sent to extract Nathan Gould, a former employee who has vital information in defeating the aliens that gave everyone the spook in the first installment. However, the situations immediately escalates for the worst and  the aliens kill all of your men. As for you, you barely survive the attack and a man by the name of ""Prophet"" saves you, and then everything fades to black.When you come to, you find yourself in the very suit that ""Prophet"" was in, but ""Prophet"" is now dead. He says in a recording that he was already infected by a virus, and says that you have to continue where he left off. And now the game begins with you off to save the world.----------------If this is your first time playing Crysis, I would suggest watching youtube vids of Crysis 1. It gives you a lot of insight to the story and (personally) makes the game a lot more enjoyable to play.I went through the game for 2-4 hours completely detached from the storyline only because I didn't know who was ""Prophet"", what the nanosuit was for and why I should even care that there were a bunch of Squidwards fighting against us. However, when I got to Gould, I finally took time to look at a recap, and the story became more enjoyable because of it.Granted, the story's not groundbreaking. It doesn't do anything too unique to stand out from most other storytelling games, but it was enjoyable enough for me to care for the characters to a small extent, which was more than enough for me to allow myself to want to play from beginning to end.As for the gameplay, it has its moments of being entertaining, especially at the beginning.You're given the option to do things that no normal soldier can do, which is being able to go invisible, have super armor, kicking cars on their side like it was some kid's bike and punching people in the face harder than a heavyweight boxer.However, this is also the game's weakness.Due to these features, the game feels too easy regardless of difficulty, and more than half the time, the enemies will make it easy for you, even when you're doing nothing at times.The AI is...special. They will shoot at you, and if you go into cloaking mode right in front of their eyes, they will immediately forget that you were even there.Their attention span is equal to that of a hamster. They will see you, and forget that you actually exist until you show up right in front of your face.Also,  I guarantee you that unless it's a mission where you're forced to fight, you can honestly just cheese through the game in cloaking mode without having to throw a single bullet, which really defeats the purpose of the game even being an FPS.But despite these flaws, this still doesn't deter from the game being fun at all. If you allow the game to, you can definitely get a nice kick out of the storyline. So is the game worth its full price at $30?No.Wait for a price drop if you really want to try out its single campaign.And when I say a price drop, I mean a price drop.This game is worth no more than $5 to $10 at best, and I wouldn't suggest spending any more than that, especially with the multiplayer gone.I spent $2 on this, and I say it was more than enough money well spent for my 12 hours of gameplay, especially with my purchase being the equivalence of a small time indie games.That said, this game gets a thumbs up from me.But be smart, and buy this game when the time is right.

												Fun game, but a few things confused me in regards to the invisibility suit power. When you're invisible, the enemies naturally can't see you; that's fine. However, your shadow is clearly still there and you would make noise when you move, the enemies don't seem to pick up on that. One more point, the throat slashing stealth kill I'm a little sceptical about. Unless with that stab you managed to cut through their spinal cord, they wouldn't die instantly. Simply cutting arteries isn't enough to ensure instant death, they'd be bleeding for a lot longer than the time that was allowed.Fun, buy it if you want.			"

												Crysis 2 is an unfulfilling trek through mindless action set pieces and a poorly written plot. I mention the plot because this feels more like a movie than a game.  Crysis 2 is an extremely linear experience.  The best thing about it might be Hans Zimmer's score.Personally, it feels like a step backwards from the original game. However, it is pretty and you can shoot things. If you pick it up don’t pay more than $5 for it.			"

												By far one of the prettiest games out there. If you have a computer that can support max graphics, Crysis 2 is a solid title. The gameplay is best summed up as a ""superhero simulator"". You can cloak, resist bullets and cut through enemy lines with ease. It's an empowering feeling being behind the controls of the nanosuit and leaves an enjoyable experience with the player. The graphics are fantastic for a game it's age but the facial animations are sometimes wonky.However it is not without flaws. The biggest problem is AI, which often ruin your stealth and commit blunders in combat, making them a cakewalk on normal difficulty. (I played on medium/normal) However, if you're the kind of player who likes to go in guns blazing (I do) then this game plays like an action movie. I did find the pacing of the story somewhat strange. You often find yourself in what seems like a ""final battle"" kind of scenario only to find out that the game still has about an hour or so to go. The fact that sprinting drains your energy makes stealth difficult and means that you have to manage the energy meter to not get caught out in the line of fire. It's a frustrating feature that thankfully got patched in Crysis 3.Unfortunately the multiplayer servers are no longer supported (I think) so it's just single player but that's okay with me.Overall, it's an amazing game that is fun to play and a treat for the eyes. For the low price and the occasional sale, it's worth the money.			"

												I was gifted this game in hopes that some multiplayer whould be had. Unfortunatly you cant play multiplayer anymore since the servers have been shutdown.Single player has a problem with V-Sync that caps it to 24fps. This is a problem for me since I game on a HDTV and not monitor. The bug creates a huge amount of latency with a controller. Also the audio stutters during cut scenes.Looks like a great game though.WIN 7 - i7 4790K - G1 980Ti - 16GBWith Ultra settings at 1080p I was getting average 140fps with V-Sync off.			"

												Fantastic game. Despite being 4 years old the graphics hold their own against big budget releases today. Multiplayer is no longer supported but this is still worth picking up for the single player campaign. This is probably heresy but I enjoyed this sequel more than I did the original and definitely see myself playing through it again at some point. 9/10Pros+ graphics (I played on ultra and they were just beautiful)+ controls (they switched up the controls since crysis which made using your mods so much easier and much more enjoyable. I used to stress about going from cloaked to armored but no longer with crysis 2+ gameplay (this felt a little more console-ish than the first but overall it was much more streamlined)+ weapons (the alt fire and mod modes are better implemented and made managing your weapons a deeper experience than in crysis plus the ability to carry turrets was great)+ enemy animations (the kill animations and ai added a lot)+ atmospheric design (the city landscape works great for this game. Hell, I think I like this NY better than the real thing!)Cons- linear level design- poor use of vehicles- not enough variety of enemies- cutscenes broke the immersion- cutscenes were buggy (audio and video late in the game would cut out)- frustrating install (the code in the Windows version looks like malware so you have to add this to your virus protection exception list otherwise most VP will kill the game close to start up... It took me awhile to figure this out)			"

												Using the suit is alot of fun, especially in stealth mode. Solid shooting mechanics and pretty good story(better than most shooters and takes place after the first game). The graphics are good, but it's a shame how much this title was held back because of the console versions. The lack of freedom compared to Crysis and its expansion is terrible, as the levels are much more linear. I felt like a predator in the first two games, not so much this time. In the end, I was just running to the objectives in stealth mode to get it over with.			"

Though, that being said, the specs on my current system are much better than when I played the last game.Overall it was really fun. A litle on the short side and the storyline was hard to follow; however, it contained some solid gameplay elements than most fps's happen to have. While this game does have controller support, the game is massively easier to play with a mouse and keyboard.			"

												Crysis 2 is an extremely interesting game that deviates slightly from your generic out the box FPS. Instead of placing you in the boots of a generic off-the-shelf character, with a sci fi protaganist who comes across as an extremely powerful super soldier who also is granted limited sympathy, something most shooters these days lack. Alcatraz is sent in with a squad of marines to investigate an infection in New York. Being effectively killed with the rest of the squad, he is rescued by Prophet from the previous game who sacrifices himself and bequeathes the Nanosuit to Alcatraz.This leads an extremely compelling sci fi story through New York with alien invasions, corporate sabotage and some killer environments. Crysis 2 truly has the most stunning city scapes in gaming and it's only recommended for high end PCs. The gameplay is also engaging and adds diversity to a standard shooter formula with invisibility, increased strength, bulletproof armour and tactical options. However the game isn't without its bugs and occasionally annoying AI, especially the Ceph. This is par for the course in FPS these days and it usually doesn't detract from the games fun. 9/10			"

												Starts off very slow, then then pick up the action. It's fun and engaging, but has it's flaws.One of my favorite things about this game is that you can unmount stationary Heavy Machine Guns and carry them around until they run out of ammo (150 shots). Those feel really satisfying, definitely a win.Some minus points: Stupid non-skippable Logo Videos when starting the gameMultiplayer has been canceled, but they still have the menu for that in game, so every time you are required to login to a service no longer available. They should have removed that.			"

												Really good game, crysis veterans will say Crysis 2 is the weaker link but i strongly disagree, then again my opinion might be a bit biased since i prefer more single player games that have attention to detail wherever you look than a sandbox game where half the stuff is just computer algorithm placement of trees and so on,Crysis 2 singleplayer is exceptional every single combat area is huge giving the player plenty of oportunity to get around stealthing(predator style) or guns blazing, the best part being that both styles play really well and at no point is forced upon the player to play in a certain style.One thing to note is also how varied the game is throught while most of the time you will be going from point A to point B as the city of new york gets destroyed the maps start to become more vertical giving you even more space to play with.Crysis 2 didnt get worse because it's not as sandbox as it's predecessor, it became a much better focused experience.The game does have 2 problems, the story while does it's job at keeping you entertained it's overall pretty dumb when you look back.

												Watching the trailer, I have to say I'm a little disappointed. I love the Crysis franchise, but I can't say I'm excited for this one. The whole futuristic thing with robots and stuff just doesn't seem right in Crysis. I think Crytek needs to find that line between innovation and sticking to the Crysis formula that made this sieres so... awesome. I can see how some of this future technology would play well into kill streaks, perks, etc. in multiplayer, but I hope they don't go overboard. I'm gonna be watching for more trailers, but from what I see so far, I don't think I'll be picking up this game; At least, not for $30. On the other side, I can't wait to find out more about ZOMBIES in BO2. I do think zombies would be pretty epic with all these new futuristic guns and robots and stuff like that. Overall, I think that if Crytek can find that line between innovation and sticking to the formula, then they can use that platform to create some awesome weaponry and have some room to get creative. If they go overboard on the futuristic thing though, it could turn into a scrambled mess that is plain disappointing to long time Crysis fans. I guess we'll have to wait and find out			"

												Excellent, excellent game even today in 2016. Great basic graphics with nice detail even on less powerful systems. The visual effects also have levels that run on a wide variety of machines.Gameplay with powered armor and stealth is fun, and the maps are detailed and fun to explore.It does have one flaw with saves only at widely spaced checkpoints. This means that you have to play for quite a while each time you start the game, with no choice to end when you like if you want to save. It can also force large re-dos of 15-20 minutes or more - BUT if you play your armor, stealth and cover properly, you can go loud or stealth and not have to do many redos.Just an excellent classic game that still looks good and plays good even now.

												Originally posted April 18 2011 gameaday-ish,blogspot.comAt the point Central Park is held aloft in huge earthly chunks settled atop writhing masses of metal tentacles, Crysis 2 turns to the player and shrugs in exhaustion: “That’s all I got, kid”.A multiplatform follow-up to the PC-killing original, Crysis 2 makes significant trades in gameplay and environments in order to excel visually on consoles. However, even when using a walled garden approach where most maps are open expanses designed for multiple avenues of attack, Crysis 2 is a metric crap-ton more fun to play than any COD clone, including COD:BLOPS.Unlike the original Crysis, where the player was dropped onto an island with a full suite of nano-suit abilities that allowed for increases in strength, speed, armor or cloaking and given leave to play in a giant sandbox, the sequel parcels out abilities over the first half of the game. Speed and strength are no longer selectable and are enabled by default. Using the energy remains of deceased enemy Ceph allows the player to upgrade the suit abilities throughout.Like the first game, the story is an incomprehensible mess only set in Manhattan rather than a North Korean island. Flora and fauna are replaced by concrete and vehicles, creating impenetrable mazes of steel and glass, rather than flowing expanses of green. Playing as Alcatraz, a voiceless, personality free cipher of a marine, the player wakes from black (the first of a half-dozen overused transitions), embedded in the suit. Immediately mistaken for the suit’s original owner and apparently incapable of independent thought, Alcatraz begins a series of guided journeys, each lead by a different voice transmission.The alien Ceph of the first game are succeeding in destroying New York City and only the nanosuit has the ability to stop them. Led through a series of switchbacks and double-crosses, Alcatraz blindly follows orders, leaving one to wonder if he had played too much Bioshock when not at work as a marine.Epic and troubling imagery leverage the lingering memories of 9-11, as the city collapses during the journey beneath above and beyond, leaving the player slack-jawed. Unlike the seemingly endless vistas of the first game, Crysis 2 is also beautiful but limited. Particle effects and motion blur are used liberally to mask the limits placed on the engine and while the framerate does waver, it does so rarely.Using the suit powers allows and even requires the player to use some strategy when engaging groups of enemies, especially early on as the enemies become more varied and more difficult, but never smarter. Unfortunately, common glitches manifest where a death-and-reload will cause scripted enemies to become frozen in place, robbing the game of challenge. Diligent hoarders of Ceph energy will also soon find themselves able to nearly max out the suit upgrades, leading to late game moments where a cloaked sprint can avoid engaging the enemy altogether.Crysis 2 lacks the open world of its predecessor or Far Cry 2, causing it to fall into a nebulous middle where it is influenced heavily by Call of Duty but not yet as horribly linear, leaving it a refreshing change from claustrophobic corridor shooting.Shame about the story.

The game paces itself well and has a consistent tone and it's really a good time. Don't go in expecting a big would you kindly twist or whatever. Go in expecting an almost They Live kind of vibe.

												The ruins of Manhattan here are how destroyed London should have felt in Mass Effect 3. Sadly, there are no hot alien chicks to flirt with. Or Biotics. Or Garrus. Or manual saving. God damned checkpoints; on hard difficulty I found stealth to be the least frustrating way to play this game. Otherwise you (read: I) die too fast too often and keep refighting the same battles, until it gets too tiring and you just use invisibility to avoid combat altogether and finish it. Strangely, there didn't seem to be the same amount of variety as the first Crysis. Fights became repetitive. Seeing New York in rabbles is cool, but overall it was a mediocre experience for me. Hard difficulty funnels your play style towards the quiet approach, lack of proper tutorial made me understand most of the mechanics and small touches only around halfway into the game - how to use which weapon and the advantages of your binoculars – and I felt no desire to explore the levels. There are collectibles, yes, but they weren't nearly interesting enough to encourage you to hunt them down. Nothing as engrossing as BioShock's audio logs, for example.If you want a shooter with a bit of a creative touch in the form of the Nanosuit and its abilities (cloak, speed, armor), it might be enjoyable. Even then, though, you get the gist of it very early on and the game doesn't evolve enough to keep battles exciting. If you're looking for a rich experience with captivating characters and an intriguing storyline, skip this one altogether.And if you imagine you're playing Shepard in London rather than Alcatraz in Manhattan, it both remedies a bit of the sour taste left in the end of Mass Effect 3 as well as makes Crysis 2's environment more exciting.

												Great game! The core gameplay is really solid; open battles where you use your suits powers for stealth, assault, scouting and agility. The weapons are really fun and distinct, with superb modeling and sound design. However the plot and pacing felt a bit contrived; a few levels were underwhelming, especialy the final one.I enjoyed it more than Crysis; the AI is less annoying (although enemies still can spot you from very long distances) and the Ceph are a lot more fun to fight this time. I somewhat miss the suit's ""strength"" and ""speed"" hotkeys, but having them as passive abilities improved the flow of the game.			"

I must say it was amazing. what I like the most of crysis 2 is you can often choose to go sneaky peaky or simply rambo.I like the shade between those two, run behind the enemy while cloaked, kill some unaware enemies stealthy, than plant some c4 behind some enemies, and go kabooom, then finish the level rambo style. I was a bit sad that there was no amo to be found for the gaus weapon and the swarmer as well, but allmost all other weapons where there with enaugh frequency.I give 9 out of 10 because of the above mentiont lack of amo and bug.yours, HERON			"

												Fantastic game. Despite being 4 years old the graphics hold their own against big budget releases today. Multiplayer is no longer supported but this is still worth picking up for the single player campaign. This is probably heresy but I enjoyed this sequel more than I did the original and definitely see myself playing through it again at some point. 9/10Pros+ graphics (I played on ultra and they were just beautiful)+ controls (they switched up the controls since crysis which made using your mods so much easier and much more enjoyable. I used to stress about going from cloaked to armored but no longer with crysis 2+ gameplay (this felt a little more console-ish than the first but overall it was much more streamlined)+ weapons (the alt fire and mod modes are better implemented and made managing your weapons a deeper experience than in crysis plus the ability to carry turrets was great)+ enemy animations (the kill animations and ai added a lot)+ atmospheric design (the city landscape works great for this game. Hell, I think I like this NY better than the real thing!)Cons- linear level design- poor use of vehicles- not enough variety of enemies- cutscenes broke the immersion- cutscenes were buggy (audio and video late in the game would cut out)- frustrating install (the code in the Windows version looks like malware so you have to add this to your virus protection exception list otherwise most VP will kill the game close to start up...

												""Crysis 2,"" where Master Chief travels to New Vegas and encounters The Flood.I swear, that's what this game felt like.""Crysis 2"" borrows a number of tropes from sci-fi and sci-fi gaming, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It feels like Crytek was pretty appreciative and respectful about how they borrowed from other stories, and that's something I can appreciate.In terms of visual design, this offering is really quite impressive. The environments are huge and detailed, even though your traversal of those environments can be a bit limited at times. (Much like ""Crysis"" and ""Crysis Warhead,"" where there was a sprawling island in front of you...and lots of mountains or cliffs which prevented you from going too far afield.) What's even more jaw-dropping is the impression that all of the hugeness probably had to be built (largely) by hand. A natural environment lends itself to certain kinds of procedural generation, whereas a ruined city is something that demands much more manual crafting.Where the game does not truly impress is in how it all knits together as a whole.The story is actually a pretty good ""yarn,"" but the telling of it is a little clumsy and not quite paced in the right way. The acting tends to be wooden, and what really ought to come out ""in game"" tends to be rendered instead as exposition over ""cheap"" cutscenes. I call them cheap because most of them are just ""tactical overview"" videos or ""nanosuit rebooting as it struggles with alien strangeness"" sequences. In a certain way, the presentation ends up giving a person the impression that it serves mostly to cover up the bulk of loading the next level. It all ends up being a little disjointed, and there's no emotional core. Even when you do meet up with the actual characters in the game, they quickly go back to being little more than voices with Internet connections.The basic gameplay is pretty good, with you having to balance your suit's limited power with what you're trying to achieve. The stealth energy management returns to good effect, with you having to think about where you can get to before your cloak drops and you become easy to spot. The ability to customize the suit's upgrades to your preferred playstyle is a nice touch.However, the gameplay is only ""pretty good."" It's not stellar. The weapons generally lack punch, especially against the aliens. While this does encourage you to think tactically, it also tends to punish you disproportionately for when you inevitably do get into a full-on fight. Further, the overall lack of hitting power combines with the long spaces between checkpoints in an unfun way. Combat tends to be a relatively slow-paced, repetitive, hit-n-hide grind...which, if you screw up, affords you the opportunity to do that grind ALL OVER AGAIN. AGAIN.It's not like the ""Halo"" series, where combat was dynamic and entertaining - and even dying had an element of fun, because it tended to be so over the top. In comparison to that experience, ""Crysis 2"" feel like a chore. To be brutally honest, I was tired of the game by the end.I also have to ding the ""stealth kill"" mechanic. Coming from ""Far Cry 4"" and ""Blood Dragon"" to the ""Crysis"" series, I definitely felt that not having a takedown system subverted the stealth aspects of the game. When I saw that ""Crysis 2"" had added its own brand of takedowns, I was initially elated. That elation quickly faded, though, as I experienced how finicky and unforgiving the stealth kill system is. The radius for it to work is miniscule, with a very sharp ""falloff."" That is, it's easy to find yourself in the transition range where a tiny bit of movement is all it takes to change ""stealth kill"" to ""melee."" It's far too simple to end up doing something you didn't expect to do, and even if you do end up initiating a stealth kill, your cloak drops for the duration of the animation. It turns out that stealth kills aren't all that stealthy at all. You are very likely to be seen and ""lit up"" by the unfortunate enemy's buddies, which is a pretty dangerous situation.I DO recommend the game because, for its flaws, it's still an interesting way to spend about 10 hours or so. It's not a bad game at all - it just isn't a genre defining title, because it sometimes gets in its own way. I say, give it a shot when it's on sale, and enjoy the enjoyable bits.			"

												Really enjoyed this game. Decent story, graphics and gameplay. Nothing groundbreaking, just fun to play as a casual gamer. Used an XBox One controller without issue. Did have to backtrack once; restore a save and replay a section to get around a glitch that wouldn't let me through a door, other than that game was solid.			"

												Combat can be is sporadic and drawn out, but still very entertaining. Seems like the developers really took alot of pride in designing the game, so they give you plenty of time to admire the spectacular maps and scenery. The game adapts very well to almost any style of player, while still feeling seamless in transition from the stealthy ninja to duke nuke'm.

They limited map sizes from the previous open world games as it went to the console market. Multiplayer doesn't work anymore. If you like crazy scifi action movies then you'll appreciate the story.

												If you like FPS games, you'll like this, because it's every other FPS, all at once.* You're the only survivor of your team, which is killed off before you're actually briefed on your mission.* You're special, because you've got this super armor.* There are soldiers, working for an evil corporation. In a shocking twist, you use their weapons against them.* Also, aliens.* Also, there's a horrible disease and the city is quarantined, using extremely brutal yet totally ineffective methods.* US flags fscking everywhere* You have to rescue some guy, who keeps giving you orders, and who somehow knows in general everything that's going on within a few miles of his location, but can't explain anything in detail.* Also, guy who needs rescuing keeps getting angry at you because you're taking so long, despite your near-death with the rest of your team, your having to travel miles on foot through all sorts of absurd side-paths, and your having to single-handedly defeat several hundred soldiers.* Hey, ammo cache! I wonder if there's a big fight coming up?* Hey, laser-guided RPG! I wonder if I'm just about to fight a helicopter gunship?* Occasionally, the game pauses for a bit of tutorial, pointing out that you have tactical options -- which are extremely difficult to actually pull off, and don't offer any advantage over the standard tactic I've used in every computer game I've played in thirty years, which is to work around the edges and pick off enemies in detail, because sneaking through the middle always means you just fight everyone at once.Uniquely, and perhaps a first for any FPS, CRPG, and for the entire meta-genre of speculative narrative, the horrible disease does NOT turn people into zombie. At least not so far -- I'm only a few hours into this game.The graphics are quite good. The designers are of the school of thought where there's incredible detail and extent, but you don't feel you can actually explore much. It's almost the opposite approach of Bethesda-style games, in which there's far less fine detail, but lots of time and space to explore.The game has several glitches. For instance, I often find I'm unable to switch between semi-automatic and full-automatic on my weapons. At least once, I had a scripted event fail to trigger. Both these problems were solved by exiting, and going back to a save-point.			"

Gone are the fun, sandbox moments where you punch your way through houses or throw chicken and turtles at enemies. So many features feel incredibly stripped down and restrictive. It's also a much slower experience, since normal sprinting now also consumes suit energy.Singleplayer is worth playing through once I guess, and there's some fun mods for it now.If you really wanna try it out, get it when it's on sale.Either that or get Crysis 3, which fixes some of the issues I had with this game.

												I rate the game Crysis 2 4/5. Good but not truly great.This first-person perspective action game has the absolute best sound effects I have ever heard in a game. The numerous gunshot and explosion sound effects in the various environments are all the best I've ever heard without being so overly strong that I feared for even a second that my speakers would be hurt by the tumult of sound. The really excellent sound effects are of an even higher quality than the advanced visuals this game offers.+Amazingly excellent sound effects which mix well (and easily) with the dialogue and music.+Outstanding, often bright, sunny graphics (but good rainy weather effects occur once too). The game runs even better than the original Crysis game did also.+The music is at least adequate and pretty epic in places with a good main theme.+Good (though fairly linear) level design.+Great, chaotic, visceral (but highly scripted) action sequences throughout.+Good weapons with nifty attachments you can pick up throughout the game.+Good power armor upgrades you can get over the course of the game.+Excellent menu options including the ability to turn of any annoying crosshairs.+Mission objectives are usually very clear.+No bugs (other than the crappy enemy AI if you use stealth tactics).+Nifty and realistic seeming urban environments for battles to occur in.-If you play the game in a methodical manner (particularly if you use sniping and stealth tactics) the enemy AI is STUPID. It doesn't matter if you are fighting human characters or alien characters, they all act STUPID, usually dismissing hints of your presence too easily and wandering around in the open while you pick them off from a distance. Up close the AI is adequate but even then the enemy tactics are seldom surprising.-Despite all the effort the game displays at trying to make you feel otherwise the levels are all fairly linear (and by and large they are much smaller and closed in than the areas in the first crysis game and its add-on Warhead). This game also has only one ending (its an adequate ending though)-The characters feel a bit generic and the dialogue is often boring.-The plot is all-too-often a convoluted mess full of contrived and stupid reasons for why you are somehow always the only person in the game with a nifty power-armor nanosuit which should have been distributed to a lot more people by now.-The aliens and their vehicles are less creative (and generally less dangerous seeming this time around. The highly effective cryogenic weaponry they exhibited in the first game and its add-on are completely absent this time to be replaced by a sort less terrifying rip-off of Nano-Black from Unreal Tournament 3.-Limited replayability due to the highly scripted action sequences in this game and once you find out how much it pays to be stealthy (and how poorly the enemy AI copes with such tactics) the game's apparent difficulty (and length) drops dramatically.-The enemies are more generic than they clearly could have been and they act, react, coordinate and generally seem to think too much like normal human soldiers. Several effective and intimidating units (particularly the giant alien squid armor suits and the giant walkers with the snakey limbs) are conspicuously missing from this game.-The final boss fight is a bit of a let-down (just a bunch of even more elite soldier aliens)			"

												A step down from the original but still worth playing if you are a fan of fps games.A big compliant in the first game were the aliens but i really liked them they had a cool design and they froze sh*t. They reminded me of the sentinels from the matrix they were really awesome.The aliens in this game are so generic in design, boring to fight and the ai is not that great. The nanosuit is not as cool as it was in the first game and the story is pretty bland. I liked the New York setting and the game has cool set pieces and sequences it keeps the game from being mediocre.The best thing this game has going for it is its theme song, its epic.

												A replay of a game I originally played on the PS3 with a M/K adapter. Definitely in the AAA range with a decent scifi story to go along with it. Most reviews gave it an 8.5+, and I think that's fair.Mechanics-wise, it's much more polished than the first Crysis game, considering it was also built for consoles, yet it doesn't have as much of an open world. You're certainly more ""channeled"" to go down certain routes. Invaded New York looks amazing, though. Two additions I didn't like were ""sticking"" to larger objects to shoot while behind cover and the half-second of disorientation after vertically mantling.The Marine you play as, Alcaltraz, is completely mute and not anywhere as dynamic as Nomad was in the first game. I missed the dialogue and interplay between the protagonist and the other characters. Crysis 3 is another solid title, but unfortunately it's not available on Steam (Origin only).			"

												Crysis 2 is a thoroughly entertaining romp-especially when played on a gaming oriented PC hooked up to a large screen with some dope audio. The story is so-so and the writing hilariously poor at times, it is the technology though that really shines, Cry Engine 2 when paired with the Direct X11 based overhaul that came about in 2012 is quite thrilling. It is comparable to blasting through a hollywood blockbuster, the audio/visual effects and overall atmosphere are so rich that you'll forgive the identikit enemies and senseless story in serach of the next epic and hugely satisfying shootout.A very different animal to the first game and not half as clever by design, one of gamings guilty pleasures. Combat scenarios usually offer several options with many alternative tactics possible, stealth kills, heavy weapons, sniping etc almost 80% of the time though the game demands a no holds barred guns blazing approach.It's a power trip fantasy not far removed from Duke Nukem Forever in my eyes. Limited replayability even with the gorgeous graphics but absolutely worth at least one play through. The wrecked beauty asthetic of New York is still a landmark achievement in gaming fidelity. The AI is generally quite smart on the higher settings and very quick to react, combat feels weighted and fluid with all of the weapons and modifications providing excellent feedback, nano suit mods is nice and well implemented addition.A very handome game indeed and several thousand times better then the abysmal third title. Buy it, play it, enjoy it.			"

												Truly better than the first Crysis and Crysis warhead, i feel like you get alot more freedom in this game, the visuals are amazing, the detail in weapons is unbelievable and the weapons themselves are 10 times better than they were in previous Crysis games, the urban experience in Crysis 2 definitely tops its previous successors.

												Great game with a lot of similarities to COD, but it still holds a similiar style to the original Crysis, and is a bit less run-and-gun. The invisible cloaks, special abilities and many corridors really make this game a great tactical shooter.  But high level players with many unlocks can hold a bit of an advantage against newer players, and it can be frusturating at times.			"

												Too much damn in-game cutscenes throughout the game, the kind of you just walk around hearing voice lines and can't do anything about it, and some dull missions because of it. Which is a shame, given that the foundations of Crysis, the gunplay and sound design, the mobility options, make it one of the best modern shooters of the PS3/360 era. If you just plodge through the slow start you eventually get to the good stuff.			"

												Would I recommend Crysis 2? In a word: Yes. There's no reason not to. Sure, it's never going to be my favourite game, but objectively it is a well crafted, well rounded FPS that builds on the things that made Crysis 1 great, including the graphics. It may be more pick-up-&-play than I would like in a plot-centred game, but it definitely passes muster as a worthwhile game to play through.I think my issue is that Crysis 2 is too slick for it's own good, getting the player into the game so swiftly that the basic building blocks for the plot are never really laid down for me. I know your character is armed with very little information at the start but several characters talk about things that they obviously expect me to understand but the game hasn't actually explained any of it to me, so I really struggled to get into the story.Add to it the characters that don't get enough time with you for you to care, despite the fact that several of them I was itching to know more about. My last minor gripe is that during level changes, you jump locations, & on a couple of occasions, the events surrounding that transition sound really interesting or would have been a great opportunity to really develop a character, in particular Commander Lockhart, who could've made an excellent antagonist on top of the general threat from the aliens. However, all of this pales against my biggest criticism & probably the source of my lack of satisfaction with Crysis 2: how do we get from the events of Crysis 1, & the blue floaty aliens, to the events of Crysis 2 with red tentacle armour aliens? At no point is this resolved & left me rather disappointed.Sadly, because of all this, I'm left just plodding through the game until it finished. Unfortunately, I wasn't pulled into the game enough to really care whether humanity won or not, hence why I was glad it was over.That's not to say the game is bad. I really liked the nanosuit being a character in itself, the difficulty balance feels really good, maybe a touch towards easy, the visuals are great & mercifully, the awful final boss fight set piece of the first game is not repeated.The game also ramps up nicely, with the plot stepping up a gear at several points & I did enjoy large chunks of the actual shooter bit. There is a wide choice of weapons & mods to tailor your combat & there are nano-mods; alterations to your suit that are unlocked by nano-catalysts which can be activated to suit the situation. The only annoyance is these are collected from dead aliens like ammo. Why? No idea, & I didn't like that as a game mechanic. I didn't make massive use of the nano-mods, but the few I did use were subtle but useful, the main one for me was a bullet tracker, making enemies much easier to target.I also really like the sense of doom surrounding the “Suit Drivers”, the bloke actually inside the nano-suit. You play a US Marine called Alcatraz, who is supposed to infiltrate New York, which is under attack but he & his team are ambushed & he is left badly injured. Later the game reveals the extent of said injuries. You are rescued by Prophet, returning from Crysis 1, who places Alcatraz in the suit to complete his 'mission' as he is infected with a virus that is killing the inhabitants of New York & is dying. We later learn that Prohpet's mission is basically a suicide mission that needs the suits capabilities & an expendable someone to man it. Basically, as long as the nano-suit can do it's thing, you living or dying is not even remotely important.Like the first game, you are left to make your own tactical choices, stealth is usually an option, but so is blasting your way through, with the risk of reinforcements arriving. I chose to use a silenced sniper rifle to clear as much as possible, then sneak through. Sometimes it worked, other times I ended up blasting away. The game does over plenty of advice, giving hints about stealth routes, ammo caches, sniper points etc & allows you to track enemies by marking them through the Visor (Binoculars) function. Being able to track enemies is really handy but the tactical hints just smacked of trying to hand-hold the player & while I ignored that function, it irritated me ever time the game told me to check the visor for tactical advice.In a nut shell, I personally do not like Crysis 2. I don't know why, it's a pretty good game, but unlike Crysis 1, I was glad when I reached the end of Crysis 2. I can't really explain what is wrong with it though. All the essential ingredients from the first game are present, the suit functions work as seamlessly as ever, customisable weapons, & a good plot so maybe I was just expecting too much. Still recommended though, especially for more casual gamers.			"

												Crysis 1 was a game-changer in many ways. When it was released, only a small percentage of the PC world was able to run it. When I finally had the hardware to play it, the hype was confirmed (it received 98% on PC Gamer magazine). I loved every bit of it. 9 years later, I finally got around to giving Crysis 2 a shot. It was just as I remembered… a great first-person action game with a solid mix of tactical elements for each objective. I blasted my way through some missions, cloaked through others, and had a great time throughout. Total gameplay was 13 hrs. Good game to pick up on sale.			"

												SP: The campaign was reasonably long and managed to drag me into the story. The maps in the campaign are large enough to choose different paths or angles to attack the enemy. It's definitely not a corridor shooter. The different abilities of the suit, combined with plenty of different attachments and upgrades, allow you to choose between very different ways to play the campaign. You can make a stealth game out of this, or go guns blazin' to play it like a classic shoot'em up.MP: I don't know whether it still functions after the Gamespy shutdown. I couldn't seem to connect with the account server. MP was clearly not the focus of this game, but I found it to be pretty amusing nonetheless. The different playstyles from the SP integrate pretty well into the MP part.Grab this game during a sale and the campaign will entertain you for at least 10 hours.			"

												Get's much better (gameplay and graphics wise) during the second half. Somewhat like the last few levels of Crysis Warhead. It's disappointing that they cut so much of the sand-boxy feel, and that graphically it's not a crisp. But as a straightforward shooter it's quite good. Just try to forgive the earlier levels.			"

												Just like its predecessor, Crysis provides both a unique and engaging premise for its campaign and top-notch graphics that once again raises the graphical benchmark for gaming. Well, kind of. It may not appear as instantly striking in terms of awesomness the original did with its lush, tropical setting but it's in the finer details and when things really escalate in the single player that will blow your mind. The sheer 'destructional' splendour of New York under alien siege has to be seen and played to behold. Seeing screenshots and a few gameplay trailers does not do it justice unless you're sitting there, at your desktop, plugged into your HDTV or whatever, with full surround-sound and maybe even 3D, escaping a sinking sub yourself. This being said, graphics don't make a game. And with such refined gameplay, it sure as hell doesn't make Crysis 2.For the core gameplay of Crysis 2, I was initially disappointed about the nanosuit's powers being reduced to stealth and armour. That quickly changed, however. Having a button for each made switching between the two far more fluid than Crysis 1. On top of this, it adds a lovely twist and breath of fresh air to what is essentially your typical combat multiplayer affair. That being said, it is a step down from the large scale frantic antics of the original. But it's this added layer of depth to the tried and tested 'CoD-style' multiplayer offering that lends it an advantage.But it was the single-player, like its predecessor, I bought it for. The original garnered some criticism to its rather basic plot, but having never seen it done so well, or in a videogame for that matter, it didn't hinder the experience one bit. Crysis 2, however, propels the Crysis universe onto a whole new level. It's obvious a hell of a lot more thought has been put into it. It's more complex, deeper and smart and makes for infinitely more compelling game. Couple this with the unique and shockingly-real depiction of an apocalyptic New York and well... I can't even begin to explain how awesome it is... 10/10			"

												Crysis is one of those franchises that I wonder what ever happened to it. Sure, the first installment was well known because of its lush detail and that ultra settings for computers at the time would send them into a meltdown and even today is used for benchmarking computer builds. Crysis 2 happened and somwhere the developers were told to either optimize their game or somehow tone down the detail because this game does not have the same reputation as its predecessor. There is also a Crysis 3, which was sold on Origin because reasons, and from then on the developers decided to go the free2play route for other games.I'll put it bluntly. Crysis 2 is more or less Call of Duty set in the future. New York City gets overrun first by some evil biotech firm that has armed mercs and then an alien invasion happens. Gameplay is what you expect; just shoot the bad guy. I get it that shooting the bad guy is the point of FPSes but most good FPSes stand out because they have something going for them; be it the storyline, an open world environment (which Crysis 1 apparently had), or something. Sure, it is easy to make a game with great graphics; there aren't any big name games out there that do have terrible graphics, but ultimately it doesn't do much for the game. Here, the gameplay is linear and repetitive. Any time you see an ammo or grenade cache means that you are going to face some sort of enemy. Rarely are there instances where enemies keep spawning indefinitely, and thus you can pick off enemies and then go about your merry way. Also, I have not noticed much of a difficulty spike between ""recruit"" and ""soldier"" settings. If anything, enemies on ""soldier"" difficulty have a bump in HP, but other than that there is no difference in AI. I get that most people prefer to play on hard because of the challenge, but there really isn't one. Hard just means your bullets go through faster. In addition, I did not see any third difficulty setting. Maybe I missed it at the beginning; who knows. One plus side that the game has are the graphics. For a 2011 title this is still a great looking game. However, there was no real immersion in the game. Compare that to Deus Ex: HR, also a 2011 title, which had much better immersion and the graphics were just as stunning. I get that immersion differes from person to person, but graphicswise this game just did not have that punch that I would've expected from a big name title, let alone a Crysis game. Major spoiler alert incoming, but it needs to be discussed. There's no getting around it; the ending of the game SUCKS. It's probably the dumbest thing I have seen in any video game (though granted I did not play Mass Effect 3). At the end of the game you have to go to Central Park, because apparently that's where the aliens are based. Great! This means you have to fight some sort of final boss, right? Well no; the enemies are just basic aliens you've come across, including the more paladin-like big aliens that take forever to kill. So, just pick off those aliens, destroy the control modules (which you had to do torwards the middle of the game; why the devs decided to repeat what you have done is beyond me), and then go to the spire. Then you face 4 cloaking aliens. This part I found ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because A: they have ♥♥♥♥♥onnes of HP, B: they cloak, and C: they hit pretty damn hard. Now what I am guessing the game wants you to do is use the KVolt guns provided at the end to stun and then kill the aliens, using your thermal vision to target them. However, since they hit hard, using that and your armor buff means you're going to be wasting energy. Ultimately, the best thing to do is find the aliens, stun them, and then melee them to death. There really isn't any other way that I can think of. It's just dumb, really. Now once that is all done you can go into the spire. Great! Does that mean there's a boss? No; just a series of quick time events (which the game loves) and then a cutscene with Prophet, who supposedly killed himself in the beginning of the game. Do you fight Prophet? No...the next scene shows the aliens eradicated from New York and then a happy ending with you waking up in Central Park and getting a call from someone spurring the events of Crysis 3. That's it. No final boss, no decisions, nothing. It's linear gameplay at its worst, and the ending was anticlimactic as anything I have ever seen.I know this game can be bought on Origin, but don't bother, really. This isn't a bad game by any stretch of the imagination. There were a few features I did like about it, such as managing your nanosuit as well as your weapon attachments, but other than that, there was nothing. Save your money, honestly.			"

												Crysis 2 is a stunning visual experience, way above the first edition which was already a milestone in video game visuals. But this is about the only point where Crysis 2 does better than its predecessors, Crysis and Crysis Warhead.The gameplay has become a boring ultra linear corridor, cut scene, corridor, cut scene, QTE, cut scene. You could expect from a highly visuals driven game like this to have exciting cut scenes at least, but unfortunately the incredibly bad story telling makes them look contrived at best, missing completely the epicness they try so hard to convey.The game also comes with a couple of frustrating game design decisions, like a hud you can barely read, vehicles you can never drive for more than 100m (compare that to the epic vehicle scenes in Crysis Warhead), or a climax ending on a ridiculous QTE.All in all, Crysis 2 is a decent game, with decent action and superb visuals, but compared to previous episodes, it just doesn't deliver.

												Having spent only $7.something on this game, I'm extremely impressed. The Maximum Edition is incredible; it really looks like it's a game from 2016 (except for the facial expressions of characters being rather static during speech). Ever since I saw the first ad when the game was still unreleased, I was a fan. I wanted this game so badly, but it was expensive for me then and my computer would never have run it. Now, my computer still barely runs it at 30+ fps most of the time, but this game is every bit as enjoyable as I thought it would be the first time I saw it. On Easy mode, I made it through in 6 hours and 40 minutes. 9.5/10, being critical.			"

												Great game! The core gameplay is really solid; open battles where you use your suits powers for stealth, assault, scouting and agility. The weapons are really fun and distinct, with superb modeling and sound design. However the plot and pacing felt a bit contrived; a few levels were underwhelming, especialy the final one.I enjoyed it more than Crysis; the AI is less annoying (although enemies still can spot you from very long distances) and the Ceph are a lot more fun to fight this time. I somewhat miss the suit's ""strength"" and ""speed"" hotkeys, but having them as passive abilities improved the flow of the game.			"

												The Basics: Very pretty disaster porny first person shooter with a cyborg suitPrevious Time Spent: 27 minutesExpectation of learning Curve: lowWhy I bought this: Extremely cheap steam sale (long enough ago that I don't remember it)First Impressions: This is a good looking game, but my first impressions were marred by expecting it to be fairly boring/boilerplate. I found myself frustrated by the long, live-action CNN/Fox News intro, and the standard tutorial which slowly unlocks controls. I did find the submarine escape in the beginning kind of thrilling, but I ultimately found it to be more annoying due to loss of control than anything else. For a game that seems to be really about a cool cyborg killing small squads of soldiers, it spends a lot of time pretending that the audience is interested in it's story.  My 3 hours: I spent the entire 3 hour playthrough in the singleplayer campaign, figuring that a game this old would probably end up not well-supported on the multiplayer front. The game takes place in 2023 in NYC, with the main character as a marine who takes on the mantle of a crazy cyborg (nanosuit) suit of power armor. This power armor confers a bunch of special abilities to the player, including cloaking, resistance to damage, and seemingly extreme strength. In a lot of ways, it plays like a more violent, sprawling version of Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Much of the gameplay is focused on advancing from checkpoint to checkpoint while dealing with environmental hazards and squads of soldiers. These challenges escalated in a pretty satisfying way during my 3 hours with the game, and did a fairly good job of introducing the player to new tactics/ideas in order to surpass them. The bread and butter of it is often finding cool places to hide/shoot soldiers from, while taking cover when appropriate, and sometimes turning invisible to feel like the Predator. The main character feels extremely powerful in the suit, bringing me back to old-school shooter games and the feeling of being a one man army. The story that's told in the game is one of an alien virus and a harsh crackdown, and much of it feels pretty standard issue, but some of the environmental storytelling great. The scene that immediately follows the opening, allows the player to slowly acclimate themselves to a New York city that appears to be under martial law, between audio records on laptops, and the horrible remains of living people. It then allows the player to slowly make their way from Battery Park and head north. The game is at it's best when it's providing interesting combat challenges, or allowing one to feel like a tourist in a believable near future New York.   My Highlight: For me, the greatest joy I had with the game came fairly early, and is pictured above, a mix of combat and infiltration set in Castle Clinton, bringing me back to one of the early missions of my beloved Deus Ex. As you can see above, the historical marker is even legible, and the attention to detail shown in the environment conveys a clear sense of place. The game introduces the stealth mechanic there, which is pretty fun, and allowed me to feel like The Predator.  My Verdict:I generally kinda liked this game, but much of the joy I got out of it, I think I got because it reminded me of things I liked better. It made me think of Deus Ex and Half Life 2 the most, between the sprawling levels, the near-superpowers given by nanites, and the environmental storytelling. I can't strongly recommend it, but I think it's a game that is good at what it intends to do .			"

												3/5 Uh. What can I say about Crysis 2? I definitely didn't enjoy my time with this game. I didn't HATE it, but I struggled to finish this game. The plot got to be a bit too much for me, but I guess with super soldiers fighting aliens, how can you do anything but go too far? The environment is beautiful but now the game is a lot more linear, and certainly no longer as open-world as the previous game. There is also a lot more handholding, and the game tries to give you options to do things but there's usually an ""obvious way"" to go that is clearly the Occam's razor (am I using that phrase correctly?) and most simple and effect method of completing the current mission. With the exception of becoming a bit of a hallway shooter, the gameplay is about the same. Also there is a ""leveling system"" in the game where you gain levels by absorbing the DNA out of killed aliens. I found this to be a terrible addition because now instead of trying to save the world, I was constantly focusing on trying to remember where certain dead bodies were so I could go back and level up once I finished killing all the aliens in a certain area. One noticeable change is that you are no longer a secretive super soldier skulking around a tropical island uncovering a hidden mystery, but now you're in the middle of a chaotic war zone trying to stop an entire alien invasion. But the plot isn't what concerned me--it was just the gameplay was so repetitive and felt endless and exhausting. I kept checking my play time and I even looked up online the average time it took others to beat the game. I hated ""leveling up"" because it distracted me and I hated the linear paths to the ends of the levels (at least after experiencing the more semi-open world environments of the first game). No more sneaking around the entire map to flank the enemy from behind--now you just walk down a New York street and try to sneak behind cars right in front of the bad guys. That being said, the game wasn't terrible--it was just a lot of negative changes from the first game. The ability to upgrade the suit was a nice addition but poorly executed. Also making the game into a hallway shooter was also a bad decision. If you enjoyed the first Crysis, then this isn't the game for you.			"
