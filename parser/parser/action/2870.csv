X REBIRTH 3.5: CURRENT STATE OF THE GAMEWith the release of X Rebirth 3.0 the game finally reached the state it should have been in at its initial release in 2013. There are still a few rough edges and design decisions that some might find mind-boggling, but overall it is a great space game that can be polished with the use of a number of mods, some of which bring back 'classic' X features such as automated galaxy traders and miners. (as of the 14th of March 2015 some mod makers are still updating their work for the new moddable UI, some mods are temporarily out of action).When considering buying X Rebirth is important to keep in mind that Rebirth is a fairly ambitious game for a smaller studio, as such there are always going to be the QA problems relating to small teams that have the ambition to make big games, like bugs working their way in, and lacks of resources meaning change doesn't happen as fast as gamers would like. To give Egosoft credit, they have adopted extensive community beta testing for each patch so the game is tested on as many different rigs as possible. On my most current playthough started at 3.2 I haven't found a single plot stopping bug, in more general freeplay I rarely find a bug, let alone one that blocks me doing what I want to do.There are still some annoyances in the game such as expected bread and butter features missing from the vanilla game (a lack of FOV adjustment is a pertinent example). But these things, as illustrated by the addition of a great new gravidar, new menu system, and external camera system, seem to have been identified, working their way back into the game as Egosoft move from bug squashing to remedying design oversights. You can now do things like transfer freight and drones between ships, and build stations in empty space, creating a new zone with 7 build points that you can rename. Now, many modders seem to be finding their feet. As the engine is tweaked for performance, and bugs are squashed, it looks like X Rebirth might be headed towards a golden age of modding (if current offerings are anything to go by). The Teladi Outpost DLC brings back more classic exploration, kind of like exploring some of the rim sectors in Freelancer which is a welcomed addition to the X Series. Also the new music in Teladi Outpost is awesome, 1980's inspired synth-pop goodness, perfect for a space game. The AI can still be a bit flakey at times, but is improving with every regular patch. Commands for capital ships are still a bit limited: You either set them off on an automated task, or give general orders such as ""attack this"", ""fly to zone"", ""fly to my position"", ""patrol"" etc. The closest I can think of is it operates a bit like Nexus: The Jupiter Incident (without the GUI)—you give the commands to an NPC captain through comms, or if you use the Co-pilot conversation mod, through keyboard shortcuts. There are a number of significant mods in alpha state at the moment that look to improve AI behaviour (in addition to Egosoft's on going work in this area).The economy is running well. New trade software means you can lock in more trades, and a mod like Yorrick's YAT (yet another trader), adds the option of automated galaxy, system, and cluster traders and miners. These all seem to run fairly well with a miniumum need for any micro. The economy is simulated but not 100% real, so the AI still makes use of a number of crutches, but this really doesn't affect the game much, at most it means the player can no longer make obscene profits for doing not much at all. That said, I still make plenty of credits in my most recent game start to keep expansion running smoothly, and the economy is flowing along well. However, if the AI using a crutch is a big deal to you there is a mod that removes the wares from ships spawned by the AI. GAMEPLAY: ASPECTS I ENJOYOne part of Rebirth that I enjoy is the set up: slowly building an empire, amassing stations and capital ships, setting patrols, essentially minmaxing an empire. If anyone remembers playing with lego as a kid, it's kind of comparable to that: you set up a cool base, build lots of vehicles, get a crew together, then muck around - it is a similar kind of ethos involved in the X series but with the level of interactivity we expect from PC games. At the moment I have about 10 stations that all support each other while producing wares to keep the galactic economy running, I have top of the line freighters and miners assigned to each station, and defense fleets that patrol my territory protecting my assets. I have named each ship and station individually with all the most well crafted names I could think of (and some stolen from famous Sci-fi and fantasy), prefixed with Iain M. Banks designations of GSV, GOU etc with a few of my own new designations. The little things like setting up an empire in this detail are what makes games of the X series fun.If this kind of empire building appeals to you then you will like Rebirth. While my empire is building, I do missions, capture ships, place trade agents on stations, increase my rep with factions, get achievements, role-play and so on. With Litauen's 'Capital Ship Bridges' mod I often sit on the bridge of a frigate ordering profitable trades as it escorts one of my galactic freighters. Then at other times it's just enjoyable to sit back, parked up in one of the zones occupied by my stations and watch the empire hum along. Personally I think if you are expecting a straight-up fighter combat space sim you will be a bit disappointed (there is still lots of fighter combat but it is not the primary focus), the wider aspects of Rebirth such as the empire building are where this game shines.Even if you decide to not follow the plot the feeling of flying around in space just exploring, seeing new places, and observing the galaxy going along with its business around you is incredible. A number of mods can improve this experience such as 'Ency's mod'* (link at bottom of review) that modifies planets, and adds nebula to create breathtaking vistas and lighting.PERFORMANCEPersonally I get okay performance, my set up is:Nvidia GTX 760Intel 4670K8 gig of ram24"" IPS @ 1920 x 1200I run adaptive vsync at half refresh on max settings in game, including all the driver side bells and whistles from Nvidia control panel, it sticks at 30fps. Some people might like higher frames but as long as the framerate is consistent and the game looks pretty I'm fairly happy.KEY TO ENJOYMENT: EMBRACE MODDING AND STEAM WORKSHOPA good idea when approaching X Rebirth is to embrace modding. The support of Steam Workshop means you can easily pick and choose features, removing things you don't like about the game and picking up new features generated by modders. Check out my curated collection of mods below for a number of improvements that save time and improve the game by adding handy new features, immersive changes, and the removal of annoying ones. One mod I can't support enough is the capital ship bridges mod—simply brilliant.Remember there is no such thing as a ""modified"" tag in Rebirth, modding doesn't ruin achievements and Egosoft intentionally made the game easy to mod and added Steam Workshop support, they almost expect us to mod our games and personalise our experience, this means Egosoft can realise their artistic vision of what Rebirth should be and the gamers can have ours—we all win.* http://forum.egosoft.com/viewtopic.php?t=362680&start=0

												This game is a disaster, avoid at all costs.X Rebirth is marketed in big bold letters as a trading game with a vibrant, reactive economy and NPC ships that go on trade runs simulating real economies. This is actually a load of tosh. More than 99% of ships (this is not an exaggeration) circle around stations in an endless loop, all caught up in a slow moving pointless traffic jam. They aren't going anywhere, have no goals and just keep doing this loop forever. The other ~1% seem to spawn next to stations then despawn when they are leaving them, never actually travelling to/from anywhere. It's all window dressing.Not that it matters anyway, since trading doesn't even work. You'll have to do some really pointless trades (deliver 100 units of food when you can afford/store 100,000? What's the point?), and when you do you quickly find that the entire trading interface and ship control is totally buggy and doesn't work. Half the time player owned ships don't actually move when giving orders, and there's no way to view/delete the orders of ships in game. If your order bugs out you have to manually edit the xml files of your save game before trying again. If you eventually get them to move they frequently reach their destination then either get stuck staring at a station, or ram into it endlessly due to awful pathfinding.Combat is really, really dull. You only ever get 1 ship, it can carry every type of weapon, but can only ever shoot one at a time and has no turrets or other hardpoints. EVERYTHING in this game is done manually. You can't automate anything. Walking around stations is... rubbish. It's full of copy pasted stations - which you'll notice by station 3 - and NPCs that only have 4 sets of dialogue and just repeat them over and over again. You're going to get incredibly sick of talking to random people about why they're all a bunch of racists, or why VR holodancers are sexy but not real. It's incredibly unengaging content and somewhat alarming how so much of the development time and focus of the game is on a feature that is not fun from the start.A lot of people have been saying this game 'has promise'. That 'it'll be fixed in patches'. It won't. This game is defective by design. You can't just fix core fundamental game mechanics with patches. Even if they manage to fix the bugs it won't change the fact that everything in the game is completely lifeless and window dressed, rather than engaging or purposeful.If there's any one good thing to say about this game, it's that at least it's beautiful. The game is gorgeous, and that's really the only thing going for it.			"

												Sadly this game has been scarred by it's terrible release, which, at the time deserved it.Currently Beta testing version 4.0. From what i've seen so far.90% bug free, there are still some bugs that have really annoyed me, (Fighters Clumping together, Remote calling Marine Officers doesn't get his Marines back on board)But the game hasn't crashed on me since 2.5 and the graphics have had a much welcome overhaul.Frame Rates have been improved (Still needs work).The New Features added since 1.0 are staggering, so much has been added that my instruction manual has been left pretty much obselete. It's not the same game you bought during 1.0.Jump Drives for Skunk, SETA making a return in 4.0. Plus a new dlc coming out.We are seeing a game that isn't as good as X3, but it's getting there.The Game stands out in it's own right and Egosoft never leave a game half finished, their reputation for fixing their games long after release is what makes them worth trusting, even after the terrible release.To those who played it and put it away I recommend you dust it off and give it one more try, whether you like it or not? Talk about it on forums, Egosoft are changing their Minds and you might get what you want eventually; they've already reintroduced SETA after saying it wasn't going to happen.They're listening to their fans.--------------------Review of 4.0--------------------So far I am over the moon with the changes.- The new Weapons crafting Mod is interesting way to beef up your weapons.- Pirates marauding everywhere, they destroy ships and send cargo lifters to scavange the cargo. (Love that Pirates now have a purpose)- Can't wait to test the new Very Hard Difficulty, Pirate swarms sounds exciting.- Better reintroduction of missile/drone supply management for Station managers.- Attacked vessels now flee battle when they lose a particular percentage of shield (Which really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, as I don't want to babysit my freighters everytime they get a scratch, they now have the wits to run away rather than get shot at till they die.) - FINALLY after 2 years they fixed the production cycle bug for Drone and Weapon factories (They're now profitable and skip to the next ware that needs producing.- Personally wasn't bothered much about SETA and jump drives being reintroduced, but it was highly demanded by the X Community and i'm glad they listened. - The holomap is allot more interactive and ordering a ship to fly to a particular point of the map is a much welcome reintroduction.There is loads more changes that I can't remember.Hope we see a 5.0? Make this spectacular!			"

												Updated for 4.0!Short version: For the plot, just watch on Youtube. This game cost Egosoft a Roguey (*formerly* a big fan/promoter/guy who runs a nice X-game site) and was a waste of a Cycrow (modder who brought life to a lot of the X-games). This game isn't a sandbox. It's a pretty garbage can.Long version: Changing the format from my 3.6 review to just be: who did their job right; who sort of did their job right; who did their job wrong; noticed changes for 4.0; conclusion. Misspellings readers notice are prbobabally intentional.Who did their jobs right?Well... nobody? Graphics people were here, until I found myself complaining too much. Who sorta did their jobs?1) Graphics people! Everything is gaugeous! Big 'ole cap ships with so many guns, to the tiny boarding pods (which open up on contact with a ship! Crazy detail)! Character models are pretty bland, and many are bald; apparently it was much worse in 1.0 though. Travelling on highways is still nice; though they've shortened the 'roller coaster' highways. Stations are huge and feel like realistic-ish space stations. Might not prefer the big empty interiors that have less game impact, but that's minor. Big problem: you still glitch through ship/station surfaces and get stuck on the inside. It seems rarer now; either 4.0 fixed most causes or I got better at avoiding collisions.2) Combat people! Weapons fire, missiles track, but there's very little balance. Missiles are useless in a firefight against fighters because they'll never connect; missiles are the only real weapon against capital ships because lasers are too low dps. Cap ships regularly have 12+ (think I've seen 17) fighter escorts. When you're trapped in a fighter, 12 to 1 odds means run or die. Or rarely run AND die. Plasma/LR turrets (look like beam lasers) have laser accuracy and can 2 or 3-shot an upgraded player ship (the turrets are mounted in groups of 2 or more, so it can functionally be an instant kill). Boarding operations frequently end with 'How did I die?' I have also never noticed any of my ships or stations launch combat drones, despite the fact I keep stocking up on them.3) Economy people! Ships fly and trade; stations will build correctly now. People assigned to posts will show up in menus and you no longer have to restart to interact, buuuut... Stations are still functionally indestructible and quickly rebuild if you're not actively shooting at them. Player stations STILL take over 24 hours real-time to construct. Construction Vessels (CVs) still don't get integrated into stations like the description says - they're ugly, inconvenient (extra crew needed, etc.), and a huge vulnerability to a station performing upgrades. I'm going to elaborate on stations later, because it was the biggest non-glitch-related let down for me.Who didn't do their jobs?1) Story people! Spoilers! You find a unique ship just before someone in an escape pod flies onto your ship (and you let them aboard?). This person stays with you through the rest of the campaign as co-pilot. And is probably the most-wanted person in the game for its first half. Whatta coincidenss! Plutarch (PMC) is suspicious of who you're meeting and order you to stand down. Right in front of a jump gate that's been offline for thirty years. But right at that moment the gate activates! And you go through! And not only don't find certain death, but find allies! Whatta coincidenz! And when you come back, you find PMC is doing a lot of crimes-against-civilization stuff, and it's up to you to expose them. And war, that's been planned for years. The main 'good guy' character also casually mentions ""I knew your father. He was a good  man."" WHATA COINCI... you get it now. Later, another gate activates (ok, maybe they're coming back online) and leads to the most powerful Argon system (protagonist allies) from before the gate crash! That Plutarch company is desperate and releases weapons using AGI (artificial general intelligence) based on Xenon (rogue terraformer) tech, and then ANOTHER gate opens to a whole system housing Xenon fleets! The Xenon start rampaging (not destroying any stations, mind you), and it's up to you to plant bombs inside a Xenon station to delay attacks. The game could have been titled ""Uncanny Coincidences... in Space!"" At least then Ego could have claimed some allusion to The Three Princes of Serendip.Changes I've seen:Collision glitches happen less rarely than 3.6. Weapon mods - RANDOM modifications to ship weapons that enemies drop. They increase or decrease damage, range, rate of fire, cooling, etc. Not all mods are good. You can craft them with dismantled mods, but the result is random, so you reload a lot. Two new weapons I haven't gotten because the story arbitrarily locks the weapons you can access. Save files are now compressed in .gz format, making them harder to modify. Cargo drones don't seem to get stuck (though we could have used transport devices from previous games and avoided the issue). Home of Light is a thing. I don't regret not getting it, even on sale. There's a tester with a positive review that includes something like ""Fix the fog! It's dropping frame rates to single digits!"" SETA (time speed-up) is back. There's a jump drive, haven't gotten it (spent time early in the game amassing a big fleet to see if you could kill a station). You can apparently cap certain Xenon ships (stuck early in the plot). There's a mission bulletin board, so you don't have to fly all over to try to find missions. Any mission requiring station defense is a guaranteed win - accept the mission, continue what you were doing before, and get paid. Because stations are unkillable.The rant:The state of stations is really irritating. They're the only non-randomly generated things in the game, and therefore their creation and destruction is the only way to truly affect the universe. Well, you can construct your own, over the course of days! Who the f*** thought that was a good idea? DAYS. But you can't destroy NPC stations. You *can* bring their hull to 0, but! AI ships (which you can't directly control without mods) are too stupid to shoot at all the modules on most stations, so those modules can't die. And 0 hull stations will be back before you can ""destroy"" a second station because they rebuild (repair) so fast. Player stations as defensive installations are pointless - spend days making a station that'll shoot a few randomly-generated NPCs? But even as factories, they fall flat. They make stuff that feeds other factories, which make stuff that feeds shipyards, which make ships. The player cannot have a shipyard, which is limiting in its own right. So you can supply one of the few NPC shipyards. Well you can buy ships from them, when they're not making their own ships that quickly despawn. OH! And you see ship info, there's a section for what command they're executing. 4.0 seemed to make that command ""???"" more. So you go close and scan the ship to find what it's up to. Well, if it's got the 'explore' command, it's going to despawn soon. So, they hid ship commands with ""???"" because too many people were aware the ships had that despawn ""explore"" command. Anyhow, you've got your factories. You've got your ships. But NPC stations aren't sand castles in a sandbox; they're steel bars with sand glued on. So, at some point you'll realize your sandbox is really a prison.Thumbs up if the review's helpful.Thumbs down if it isn't.Por favor.			"

												I was an idiot to think this game was worth full price on launch. Once the game-breaking bugs and technical problems are fixed there STILL won't be a game underneath.The biggest issue is that, compared to previous X games and every other space game, there is simply nothing to do at all. Every feature of this game is a boring time sink - you walk around stations for no particular reason, to find copy-pasted people who serve no real purpose, to aid you in your quest to fly your one solitary ship that isn't in any way fun to pilot. Everything is a chore to do once and then tiresome to have to repeat again and again. The terrible interface doesn't help either, with you and your poor idiotic co-pilot spinning around in your seats trying to figure out the useless map system.Why would I bother capturing ships when I can't really do anything fun with them? Why would I build a trade empire and amass credits when there's not really anything to buy with those credits? What's the point in gaining a faction's favour? What is the point? What is the point. why am i even aliveThe graphics in space are pretty and I enjoyed playing around with the long range scanner. But that's about it. I regret buying this game, and you shouldn't buy it either.SHOW ME YOUR WARES, PLEASE.			"

												Probably the worst implementation of a space sim/trader game ever. Questionable design choices such as flying to 'info points' to get discounts that make trading worthwhile, tedious travel system and ship humping mini-game (you will see if you choose to buy), 'station immersion' where you're forced to walk through hallway after hallway of ugly textures to get to a junk merchant who will then buy your space junk at extremely low prices.  Besides a complete overhaul and redesign, this game is unsalvageable even with patches. Avoid unless you are staging a public critique of game design choices and this will be your example for poor direction.			"

												Terrible game design, with many of the basic features required to be able to play confortably now gone, such as easy and plentyful information on stations, autopilot for very long journeys ect. The menus are terrible, you will spend more time traversing the aweful menu design than playing. The map for the universe and areas is so small you might as well never look at it, you cant zoom in and it has no detail. The voice acting is terrible and annoying to the point i had to play on mute, and the bugs lol... oh the bugs... The game is Bassicly HALF completed, with bugs that should have been ironed out well before launch. I LOVED X3 terran conflict and albion prelude, so its very sad to see the state that this game has been released in. Once again we have been LIED to about how this game actually is. The game is just simply broken, you cant see half the menus, orders do not work, story stops because the game doesnt acknowledge completed missions or tasks. I have been robbed of my money, and i will not purchase a game from the companies involved again, or for a very long time.			"

												This game makes it incredible hard to like it.The worst for me:This game would have extremly high screenshot potential. Yet it works actively against anyone who tries to make good screenshots. There is no way to disable the cockpit view, and no external view. No way to disable the Hud. No way to pause without that the menu comes up. ect.Maybe there are ways to do this stuff that i couldnt find yet, i didnt look into console commands or ini files or anything yet. There are probably solutions to be found for those things.The rest of the bad stuff:The UI is pretty bad, unintuitive. I mean the UI was bad in X Games before, but i wish the old system back after playing with the new one. The fact that they ""optimised"" it for using it with a gamepad makes it feel forced and bad with M&KB. The learning courve is pretty bad, also because of the bad way the UI is designed.There are lots and lots of other minor things, like only one ship with 2 rooms where you can only freely move around in one and cant do anything than close or open a door. The ship stays allways the same besides of functional upgrades that have no optical effect as far as i know.The Map is pretty much useless, the one in the former games was leagues ahead of the one they put in now. The stations interiors are looking pretty much the same everywhere. All feels lifeless and staged. The ""Persons"" in them look like manequins standing around, without any purpouse. And most of them look really horrible.I could go on and on, this game is utterly rubbish in usability and immersion, yet it would hold still great potential if they would correct their errors and work on the game more. The core mechanics are there, and it does look pretty in space.I am sure we will see lots of patches and probably also expansion packs / dlc. Which hopefully will improve on the rather bad first impression.Dont buy this yet if you dont have a high tolerance for bad / unfinished gamedesign, take a look at it in a year, it might have matured to be something more likeable and playable by then.Addendum:.... somehow, after all this said.... it still drags me in.... somehow. I probably have a high tolerance, or maybe because i played all the former games...The more you play it the less heavy the faults become, there is some truth to that.Its more a thing of discovering new sectors and exploring, that feeling of adventure is still there to a point, for me.Its just not as good as i hoped it would and should be *sigh*-------------Update after the new review system for steam and about 10 days after the review was initially written:Egosoft is patching and updating and improving it since the fiasco that was the launch. We saw 5 patches so far, they work on the bugs, which is good, but most of what is broken is the gamedesign itself, and that is hard to fix. Its not an X Game any more its something different, it lost its soul and heart.			"

												Not going into bugs as has been noted ego is noted for releasing buggy games. No radar...in a space sim.....with dogfights and 6 axis enviro.....DOS games had that....sighNo wingman/fleet commands worth mentioning in a game that promotes fleet building...sighNo targeting commands of any type....again basic sim (space or flight) functionality since the DOS eraNo free look.......How does one produce something with less basic functionality than 20+ yr old DOS titles that you needed memmaker just to run? The station interaction is ok the first time you see a map; by the umpteenth time running around the same exact set-up looking for a particular npc/crew member one begins looking for other communication options, even two cans on a string.  Apparently  however in the future broadcast communications don't work anymore.  One of the most popular mods atm is one that completely removes the whole walking in stations concept. Ditto the HUGE real estate area flight deck that takes up roughly 1/3 of the screen, compounded of course by the afore mentioned free look, or lack thereof.  The UI is still imho the biggest barrier to getting into this game, in the quest for ""accessibility"" scrapping most/all UI elements that were tried & true monikers of an X game; it managed to pretty much succeed in being cumbersome, unintuitive, tedious, or just broken from the most hardcore diehard x-fan, to the most inebriated, ADD console based drive-by gamer.  I really can't figure out what type of demographic they were aiming for as I've never seen a single individual let alone a marketable demographic that could enjoy it.The various types of parasite drones you can employ is actually a pretty neat concept however very little of the game requires or rewards their use.  I't  is often simpler/faster to perform combat actions oneself.  The hack variant makes your player ship vulnerable and non-responsive to any Tom ♥♥♥♥ or Harry that comes around wanting to pick a fight.  Your co-pilot is there for poorly textured cleavage and a big mouth, nothing more.  Certainly nothing so outre as fighting the ship while the pilot is indisposed.  Better to die while telling betty to shut up. Xbox controllers work a peach, majority of J/Stick HOTAS setups do not  Mouse K/B somewhere in the middle Grandmas are everywhere, since stations are pretty much copy/pasted you get no distraction from themthe voice work..  well it's an ego game I give em a pass never was a strong suit for em. They seem to have forgotten that sim is short for simulator (last real world flight deck I was on had a couple or two more than 8 buttons) You can pretend you have a trade empire with one ship that needs to be mother hened constantly and will derp out at the slightest provocation.If you plan at anytime to trade/build/mine get ready to see a fair amount of .xml editing (save games are in xml format)I wasn't going to mention bugs and I don't consider these as such as it's a reflection of the type of AI they could cram into an XBOX platformCap ships are glorified taxi's they serve no other useful purpose other than a quick cash infusion by selling captured caps.  Most of the time they won't even fire back if something starts blowing them  the *** upThe AI scripting in conjunction with the reputation systems...sighThe vast majority of ships one sees flying around are actually fluff they do 1 circle on an indefinite loop never docking anywhere or interacting with anything.  They are ambience nothing more.  Another popular mod is removing most of them as it can increase frame rates. With heavy mod use and a fair amount of time editing .xml saves this game can manage to reach basic utility and functionality for a space sim.Some things particularly the AI are going to end up being brick walls I think for the mod community; so once all the dust settles you'll still be stuck with a title that's really neither fish nor fowl as far as the platform it's capable of being enjoyed on by most new and old players alike.  Even the UI is probably going to be interesting to modify in any depth.			"

												If your a fan of the original X series this game will dissapoint you.  They removed almost all of the fun aspects of the original game and turned it into a bad console port. Seven years of development and the game appears to be about 1/4 complete.  You cannot build or trade as the engine is completely broken and the game economy is tanked.  The entire idea of trading is flawwed as you have to prescout all your trades which means flying around looking at the same stations over and over.  Then you tell your trade ship to make the trade which is currently broken.  When it does work it take about 30 minutes to an hour to do one trade.  During that time they expect you to fly around and look at more stations.  After playing for 125+ hours and countless hours in the original games its just sad to see what they've done to the game.

												No recommendation, unless you can get it on sale and eventually, not come to the conclusion that you've wasted a lot of money. I had written a rather long review, but apparently there's a limit to how much one can post, so without elaboration, here's a summary.- It is a sandbox game with a constraining ruleset. You are only allowed to fly one ship (which is upgradable, that's something), and control other ships indirectly. You can build stations, but they can only be built at predetermined locations in the game. You can not actually meaningfully impact the economy as your profits are negligable, you have no meaningful impact on the AI production, the AI can endlessly spawn ships, and stations cannot permanently be destroyed. So, you can only build sandcastles designed by somebody else, the other kids already have sandcastles that you can knock down but they just rebuild it, and you can't kick any other kids out of the sandbox permanently.- The campaign, like many sandbox games, is a glorified tutorial, which you need (unless you google *everything*) because while the controls and functions are inherently simple, they are not obvious. However, the campaign also arbitrarily sets you up with an enemy faction, no matter how friendly you were with them before, and this event is *entirely* outside of your control. Fly to the mission location, and it will simply happen. Faction relations range from -30 to +30, with the predetermined enemy faction I was at +28 when I decided to continue the main mission, and the game just set it to -20. Because plot. Which has no other function other than to teach you the game and send you on an exploration through the universe. Accept it will happen, or start in Freeplay.- Nothing you do has any impact. However, since everything in the game moves at a snail's pace, you won't notice this until many hours into the game. You cannot meaningfully impact the economy. Enemy ships just spawn, they do not get built, they will always keep coming. You cannot permanently destroy stations in order to conquer the market. This last one especially has an important player function: you cannot accidentally screw yourself over by permanently ruining the economy and/or production chains. However that also means that once your own productions are set up, the only result is that prices go down due to overproduction and it means jack ♥♥♥♥ other than even lower profits than what you'd have expected.- The only ships that are meaningful (other than your own) are capital ships (L and XL size). Smaller ships are pathetically weak, and even the L size ships are at a huge risk of being randomly destroyed.- The AI is horrible, in many ways, and has seemingly arbitrary rules that rely on whether or not you are present in the same zone. Pathing is terrible, ships will ""ghost"" through objects when you are not present and thus follow an efficient path, but if you are present, will become stuck in impossible locations. Your mining ships will fly straight towards hostile stations, inevitable getting destroyed, because the closest resource is in that direction. Ships that get attacked, will never flee, unless they happen to be under your (in)direct control which means you get a message when they are half dead and have to press 5 buttons to tell them to flee, which they may or may not do in time. Fleet groups will not stay together, and will arbitrarily not react when a ship in their fleet gets attacked. The best one I found though: at a jump point in a sector, there was a hostile station close enough for some of its turrets to start firing at my ships if they jumped to that zone. I thought I would solve this problem, by shooting the station's turrets. I did so, and it worked, the turrets stopped firing at my ships, and they moved on without much harm. THE SECOND I LEFT THE ZONE, my ships would get destroyed before they could even make their jump out, because the game arbitrarily decided the turrets were back. This behaviour would stop if I flew back to the zone and the game realized the turrets were in fact destroyed.- Drone AI is FUBAR. If your ships deploy the drones they have, there's a good chance they will not return to the ship once the fight is over, and the ship jumps out without its drones, causing them to be useless pieces of metal where they were left behind. However, the ship will not recognize these drones as lost, listing them as ""in use"" forever. Unless you manually find them and shoot them. If you sell the ship's drones, and then buy new drones for the ship, the drones will again be listed as ""in use"". This problem has been around for a long time, and apparently isn't important enough to be fixed.- Loading times and mechanisms. You load the game, it gives you a loading screen. Not for the game, but for the intro movie. You skip the intro movie, it gives you a loading screen. Not for the game, but for the menu. You load your save, you finally get a loading screen for the save, which then puts you in the game. Should you get destroyed, you get a game over screen. Once you get that to respond, you get a loading screen. Not for your last save, but for the menu. Once that is loaded, you can again start loading your save. If you are in a tricky situation and get destroyed a few times in a row, this gets aggravating QUICKLY. I'd strongly recommend installing this game on an SSD if you have one, it dramatically increases loading times and performance.- I-don't-know-WTF-you-are-doing-syndrome, AKA memory leaks. The longer you play this game, the poorer its performance gets. I could launch the game, have fun with fairly well working controls and gameplay. After an hour, I would start to notice input lag on my commands (and there's a lot of button pressing in this game, enough for that to get really irritating). After two hours, I would start to notice sluggish behaviour in nearly all departments. Some googling about this problem revealed that the game uses a lot of memory for behind-the-scenes calculations, and otherwise well working systems with relatively low RAM can suffer. That could be a fine explanation, but when this problem gets progressively worse, it's not a hardware fault, it's the software.- The game is aesthetically boring. Not initially, the graphics are good, there's a lot of detail on the models, and your first few hours venturing into space (as well as hitting some new areas with distinct styles) will make you ogle your surroundings shamelessly. However, after that, you start noticing that everything actually looks identical. A slightly more red shade of paint doesn't actually make a new ship model. You notice the stations pretty much all look the same, which makes some sense in a space environment, modular designs are effective. But then you notice the planets do too. And the astroids. And the mass traffic, which has no other function than taking up space and making space look more ""alive"" because mass traffic is a bunch of small ships travelling in a circle around an object, or appearing out of nowhere inside a highway. And after a while, the music, which sounds appropriate enough for a space enviroment, quickly becomes boring.In conclusion, this game had a lot of potential, and a lot of good ideas, but is overall, fairly poorly executed. You will encounter bugs. The immensely stupid AI will get on your nerves. A sandbox where you cannot meaningfully impact your surroundings, is not a sandbox. A place where every look and sound is repetitive, is not aesthetically interesting. The biggest challenge in the gameplay, is not hitting the wrong button when inputting a needlessly complicated sequence for a command. The plot is a tutorial that doesn't care about the sandbox aspect, since it in no way respects what you've actually been doing. And yet, I have 200 hours in this game, and that is the worst of it all. These problems do not appear until later. My empire of 200 hours, affects nothing.			"

												After a year of bug fixes and added features, this game starts to come nearer to an entity like it's predecessor, but in it's own right. It's now playable, I haven't gotten the game breaking save bugs and other random crashes that were plaguing my initial attempts to play this game. (Edited with later game experiences within parenthesis)The GoodishI myself personally enjoy acting like a commander of a large fleet sending my ai companions into battle to kill off or be killed off by large xenon and pirate capital fleets. This is where the game shines to me in comparison to previous X games. If you don’t enjoy watching things unfold from the sideline and only enjoy the flying around capturing new ships to use part of the old X games for yourself I’ll stop you here and not recommend the game to you, unless you like having them alongside you then by all means proceed. Mining is vastly improved though! <<< Like really a hell of a lot better mining system. (still not required for a successful game experience, highly recommend it when you have the extra cash, at least from an automated standpoint when you need to supply your own stations with materials. Otherwise continue stealing freighters)Fewer menu trees (though it’s only good in theory because the automation isn’t there so you just have to hope there is a command you need in whatever situation you got into… if you’re doing combat mission don’t forget to remove your mining ships from your squad)(I’d of prefered more menu choices with less of a hierarchy from X3 so that they weren’t hidden away.) Space Graphics… don’t look inside unless you want a dollar and old toffee candy. The Disappointing;The bad things that I see in this game are mostly from a lack of automation available to the player in the old X games and missing fleet commands that really weaken the whole spin on having one ship through the whole thing. --If I have to spend 10 min sending orders to trade out, that’s not a better trading system in my book it’s a depreciation of something that was much better in the old X games. Player Stations I’m really disappointed that they are limited to defined areas within zones, the ability to set-up outposts anywhere in X3AP was so cool and satisfying that as I write this I almost feel like hopping over removing tubes and starting a real empire. That being said I do prefer the new player station system as a whole, but the lack of freedom here brings it down to a level below it’s original roots with station complexes. (After getting more hours into the game and scaling up my own economy, I really must say that the game falls way short here, I like the scaling of the stations but the building and expansion of improvements takes far too long and I don't feel like running my computer for 7hrs+ just to have a single section build waiting on supply bottlenecks because my other stations and traders are busy)Earning cash as a whole just seems so backwards in this game that I can’t even begin to describe my disappointment in this area. In what sense should I have to spend 7-8mil to buy a ship that does an actual economic activity only to make 250k an hour when I can just go long range scan for 15min get lucky and make 1.5mil off 100 crates of station trash items. (Adding in there are really only 3 things you can do for cash, long range scan, board ships, and board ships. For a game speaking of economy as an integral part of the gameplay experience there seems to be a lack of reward for doing the most basic economic tasks in the economy, the way it is currently set-up owning mining or trading vessels is a waste of cash and you must essentially own your own economic empire to even think of making a penny from station building since you can't make a profit because of what for me seems to be a set demand basis from the other factions with their preset number of stations, they need to build more stations in zones and expand against you and other factions)ConclusionAnyway I don’t recommend Re-Birth over X3AP or over any game really for that matter at this point. not worth $50, but if you could get 75% off or something huge go for it. (After putting a good solid playthrough at 50hrs into the game and scaling up to the point where I had multiple combat fleets the game just feels stale, There isn't the threat of a true pirate menace, my biggest woes are managing an economy between my personal stations and assets through a few god awful menus, or commanding a fleet to jump in or out of combat zones as I wreck, or get wrecked, by the npc faction I feel like killing at any moment. When the ships do get into fights it's a pretty beautiful light show, but that's about all it has going for it at this point. It's fun for a bit, but after the first few station sieges and capital battles you're just grinding in a single player game to grind. You can't effectively manage the systems you take and you can't produce new factions  of resistence to your mighty fleets. ----I'm quite peeved that I can't command Xenon I's which I consider the most beatiful ships in the game and the producers of some of the better laser light shows when carriers and destroyers jump in. What Would Improve it!AIThis game could be better with an overhaul to the menu choices and npc faction ai, micro and macro level ai combat and economy, something that allows for recognition of a certain asset level allowing for new diplomatic options with the factions as an equal, or something to that extent, allowing for a scale up of fleets sent at you or to assist you in zones that you have influence over determined through % assets in systemBetter Ship Designs --- Why are ""half"" the ships that are flyable freaken  flying Y's that's great and all but I like where the designers went with the xenon I sleek and tons of guns. If I have one ship I better be getting one helll of a show. Less congested menus, maybe even more of them just less hidden trees of menus, I don't know, but as it is now it's rather annoying. It's like there was no change from the previous games with the continued use of hidden menus. It wasn't a problem in the old menu system of too many menus it was the hidden options, at least for me, that caused the problems.Trading needs to be automated beyond station purchases, I am going to advocate for an exporting trade option beyond inter station purchases of my own assets. ....unless I somehow missed this and it's a hidden option i'd like to be able to set a trader to export finished products rather than wait for my station to lower the price of its' goods. pricing sliders solves this issueFleet Management and Supply --- Really needs to be betterI want sliders for automated purchasing amounts of drones and ammo with fleet managers that have accounts, as it is now I can only manage one fleet at extremely  poor efficiency time wise, literally takes me 2hrs to get all my ships repaired, stocked, and all while making sure they are in the right places.)...Might Update as I play more, if I play more and flesh out more of my experiences with newer updates or if I think of more issues/positives. --updated after another 30hrs for a total 89hrs (left the game on over night twice to build stations subtract 12hrs, but I count that as actively playing)note I'm probably done playing until the expansion release. I'll be starting a new save to get the experience fresh to add to this and any other projects if there are any changes that will affect the early low free capital gameplay. current review after patch 2.51			"

												As a fan of previous X games, I pre-ordered X Rebirth and started playing it within minutes of release. Like many others, I was struck both by the sweeping changes to the “X” formula established in the preceding few titles, as well as the horrid, god-awful, soul crushing bugs and technical hang-ups.I invested approximately 180 hours in the first couple of months, doing my best to study the universe and bludgeon my way through the infuriating campaign, and after doing so (the dev’s released a steady stream of patches through this period, turning the game from utterly broken to sort of kind of maybe just a little playable), and my private verdict to my gamer-y friends and family was “Do Not Recommend, Stay Far Away!” Which hurt a little, because I could see the game’s potential glimmering far down in the deeps. I think the thing that troubled me most back in those early days was the fact that even if you got past the bugs, which many did by editing game files, the new universe was essentially simplistic and lifeless. Even if all the game’s systems worked flawlessly (and they didn’t, not by a long shot), there was really no point in playing because, in my opinion, the universe and the mega-stations that looked so darned pretty from a distance, were essentially just empty shells, no more interesting or compelling than glittery Christmas ornaments on a well dressed up tree.Now fast-forward a year & umpteen patches later to the release of v 3.0 and the expansion Teladi Outpost.What a difference a year makes. After letting the game gather dust since early last January, I finally re-booted and started a new Free Play session and dove back in. Right away, I noticed a plethora of changes, ranging from cosmetic graphics enhancements to radical shifts in the design of the game’s UI and underlying mechanics, most of which a very vocal crowd had screamed to the rafters that the dev’s either couldn’t, or wouldn’t, change a year earlier.-The menu had been switched from a cumbersome, un-intuitive radial style menu to an easily manipulated sidebar style menu, one that was lightning fast to navigate and cool as all hell to look at. Contained within this menu was a newly redesigned map, complete with two different information modes, and a wealth of new tools for tracking and maintaining my property. -Now there was a reason to actually go into the stations other than to crawl around inside their air ducts: to find loot that was useful for crafting items that was either worth a ton of money, or even better, could be used in exchange for virtual seminars (training videos that could be applied toward your hired officers, increasing their various stats) or even better yet, hiring permanent Trade Agents on any given station who would constantly update your trade computer with current buy/sell offers from that station, the XR equivalent to X3’s Advanced Satellite Network.--Haulers/Traders from far off systems now populated the universe, such as the factions LI or PMC from Albion trading with stations in Omicron Lyrea, or Canterran vessels docking at the No Limits Spice Farm in Albion space. This had the overall effect of making the universe seem a lot more meaningful and bringing it to life, for me.--Faction owned destroyers patrol and react to threats and many haulers travel with either fighter or frigate/destroyer class escorts, and the player is free to assign these kinds of escorts to his/her haulers, too.--Redesigned mission offers & rewards; now there is always something for the pilot to do, patrolling zones and engaging in frivolous but fun dog fights, protecting stations, sabotaging rival factions’ stations, etc. These missions are plentiful and updated regularly, and function not only as a means to put some credits in the players account during the early game phase, but also to build faction rep for the later stages when the player begins to build their trade fleet/station network.--There are now ways and means to order your squad around that actually work pretty well. Not exactly fleet management, but getting there.--The ability to place stations anywhere I liked.--Small shipyards open for business! More capital ship choices for purchase in general, as well as an overall increase of the types/styles/configuration of ships in the galaxy.--Redesigned highway travel. On this note, I’d just like to point out that with the release of the Teladi Outpost expansion, Egosoft is now introducing a whole new style of sector to explore (new to XR): in Teladi space, you are given a huge area to explore, filled with hidden lockboxes, interesting new stations and nebulous electrical storms that obscure your view and potentially damage your ship, and you are not given any highways to show you the way around. This seemingly small touch does a lot to increase the sense of mystery and epic adventure that was missing from the initial release, essentially forcing the player to explore again.--Most bugs have been squashed, leaving no game-breakers that I could find. That is not to say that XR does not have bugs, I’ve found some ranging from irritating to downright aggravating, but in all cases they were minor and easily ignored.I could go on and on listing the improvements, but I think I’ve made my point clear that the dev’s have been hard at work tightening up their systems and introducing new content. I’ve got roughly 100 hours into v 3.0 and I feel that I’m hardly scratching the surface. The bottom line is that they’ve created a rich, compelling, beautiful space-fantasy for the player to become engaged with and tinker about in, a universe that can easily gobble hundreds of hours of the players time.The best way to approach X Rebirth is to just enjoy it for itself and not hold it up in comparison to it’s older siblings. Final verdict 80/100			"

												It's not really a successor to X3, even though it continues the story about 50 years after where X3 Albion Prelude left off.Gameplay wise it's a definitive reboot, so if you're looking into more of the same from the X3 games you're probably wrong here.However, this doesn't mean old X fans can't enjoy the game. And don't worry about the older bad reviews, In the current state (3.61 + Teladi Outpost) it isn't bad at all - just different. And just like with the old X games, mods fix the things that Egosoft won't or didn't (yet).The Steam Workshop integration means the mods are easily installed.Want to get rid of nebulas? Mod. Want to win the conversation and hacking minigame every time? Mod. Automated traders and miners? Mod. Jumpdrive in your ship and not just NPC ships? Mod. Want to see the stats of hireable NPCs without playing the minigame? Mod. And definitely get the ""Capital Ships Bridge"" mod, it's makes piggy-backing on one of your capital ships much more awesome!Really, it's fun, in a different way than X3, but still familiar. It's more of a cross-over between Darkstar One (1 upgradable player ship, cockpit view dogfight combat, randomly generated side missions) and X2/3 (build stations, build/capture ships, assign them to tasks, make money the 'economy spreadsheet' style) with some new features thrown in for good measure (giant stations you can land in, NPC hiring, hack/scan/mine-laying drones you can remote control) and some very, very pretty graphics.If you can get it cheap and like space games, definitely give it a try.Get it: If you like the X games in spirit (trade build fight think); if you like Freelancer; if you like pretty space graphics; if you want something arcady to feed your flightstick with; if you can get it cheaper (not more than 30€ I'd say, including the Teladi Outpost DLC; I think I paid like 20 € for the bundle and will get about 100 hours out of it, and Egosoft is still working on more updates and DLC)Don't get it: If you want Borons or Paranids - there're none in the game (yet?); if you want to build a massive, galaxy wide, automated trade empire with dozens of station complexes and hundreds of automated ships (theoretically possible in Rebirth, but takes much more time and effort to build and maintain); if you can't accept that you personally can only fly one (upgradable) ship; if you don't want to try out mods (fun and convenience at least -50% without mods)			"

												With the 2.50 Patch the game is now where it should have been when released, that is, really playable, hardly any ruining game bugs.Now you can start from scratch, earn cash with your long range scanner, get some money for your first little traders (gigurum), make deals with stations, earn reputation through missions, make deals with trader agents to keep station trades updated to your computer and start building your empire. And if you want your fighting rush, on hard difficulty you need to wise up to survive battles against more than a 3 small ships and capital ships are a real challenge (not like before which you could capture with no effort).Factory building is the most rewarding and polished thing in this game, building your complexes bit by bit, to make huge profits later on (if you do the proper ones in the proper locations obviously, Fusion Reactors anyone!? wink wink)All the game needs right now is exploiting exploration to a greater extend, add hazardous areas, npc factions with more life, etc. but that is already coming in December it seems, anyways, with a bit more stretch in the end-game, that is, what makes sandbox games interesting (lots things to do aside from the main plot story).So I can only recommend this game as it is NOW and congratulate for a good job to Egosoft from lifting this one up from the ashes. They made a good engine but the state of release was simply rushed and aweful. Luckily they have managed it well.Just buy it if you are into space genre, trading, factory building, exploration (later on), huge cap ship fighting, etc..			"

												Its a 50$ Beta(Written on 5/17/2014 patch 1.3) I cannot recommend this game to any one, being new to the X universe I thought this game would be a good introduction to the series, even being updated with many patch. Unfortunately from further research into previous games, one in particular keeps coming up, X3 a game from 2005 which seems to have so much more then this game. My biggest disappointment has to be the Albion skunk, it’s just not fun being stuck in a single ship, in a universe with many more interesting ship designs and varied rolls for combat and trade. The point that killed this game for me was saving up the currency to buy an Arawn, a ""super carrier"" only to find that I the player can't fly it.Now this game does have some things in its favor.•	The soundtrack is wonderful•	The universe is large and atmospheric •	Ship models are interesting and engagingThe following are things that broke the universe for me•	Character models are poor, many of the characters look like there in their 80s•	The Albion skunk is the only ship you can use. (To hit this point harder: you can only explore the ramp and a break room in the Albion skunk, the cockpit is just a HUD cut scene.)•	Missions have terrible rewards for what’s required of you•	Voice acting is limited and delivered as if the voice actor was tired and not interestedThis game is NOT worth what they are asking and Egosoft deserves the criticism, this game is worth the 33/100 metacritic gave. Save your money, don’t even buy on sale wait a few more years, maybe in another year or so, this game will be worth 30$.			"

												This game is nothing like what was promised. The controls suck. It seems they geared this game for consoles. It is nothing like any of the other X-series games. Basiclly all the goodness and awesomeness from previous X series games was not put into this game. Half the time it is so unplayable its not worth the money. With my high-end system I barely get 20fps on low graphic settings. The trading system is non-functional trade ships just go in circles not docking anywhere to trade goods. Missions are buggy meaning you can't even complete them. Hiring crew is a waste they don't even show you there skills until they are on your ship then you find out they have no skills and you wasted creds in-game. Egosoft screwed up royally. This is a MAJOR DON'T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you want to get into the X-series games I suggest X3:Reunion, X3:Terran Conflict, or X3:Ablion Prelude over X Rebirth			"

												I have over 500 hours playing this game.  This is a good game with a bad rap.  Yes, It was not ready for launch when it came out.  Yes, they (Egosoft) could have done a better job explaining to fans of the other X games what this game really was (not X4). But despite all that, I can say this game has some great elements  and features that are truely groundbreaking for space gaming fans.   With all the patches and mods now available, fans of previous X games should come back and give this game a shot.  Nobody plans on making a bad game and the folks at Egosoft are no exception.  They have stood by there product and fixed their mistakes in an admirable fashion that should be applauded.   We (gamers) need devs like Egosoft to take chances, push the envelop, stretch our imagination and entertain us in emersive story driving simulated worlds.  I highly recommend this game for fans of space games new and old.			"

												When I first read about you online, it sounded like we would have gotten along really well.  You looked attractive and we seemed to have many of the same interests.  I've spent some time with your older siblings and we had a lot of fun hanging out.  They had their quirks, but they were fairly easy to look past and I'm glad we had spent the time together.  I was expecting that being with you would be as much fun, so I went ahead and put my money where my mouth is and picked you up one evening.Let me tell you what, I was really excited to finally get to meet you in person, and when the time came that we finally DID meet, I quickly went to work learning what I could about you.  You were indeed pretty to look at, but then I heard your voice.  It just didn't come off as natural and you sounded pretty scripted.  That was okay though because I was still excited to find out who you were on the inside.  Well, it wasn't too long before things started to slow down and then you suddenly disappeared on me.Well, I thought that was odd, but our time together was still new and so I didn't think much of it.  I got to reading about some experiences other folks had with you and it seemed to match what I was doing.  Some folks had some tips on how to further our relationship, so I figured I'd give it a whirl.  Made a few changes before we got together again.  It seemed to help some but after hanging out together a few times you started to show that you just weren't that ready for a serious relationship.  Okay.  Let's be honest.  You weren't even ready for a casual relationship.You had some serious issues with your personality  Your memory didn't seem to be all that good, as every time we hung out, it was like we had to start our relationship all over again.  This happened quite a few times.  It was really odd, but other folks told me that was normal though it really hacked off some folks.  You also wore the same things alot.  Sure, they may have been different outfits, but they looked pretty cloned.  You also use WAAAAAAY too much glitter in your makeup.  Wow.In spite of all that, I kept at our relationship.  It seemed like it was going to pay off too.  You made some changes and we got a little further each time we hung out.  It seemed to take FOREVER but things started to really move between us.  I was able to look past a lot of your faults (which were not few) and put in the time necessary to try to make this work.  It was going great and I was finally starting to get emotionally involved (which admittedly took a bit of forcing) but then it was over.  I was confused.  Is this really all you had to offer?  Were you REALLY that shallow?  All that time you spent in China and you come back like this?  I guess I shouldn't be surprised.Needless to say, I was really angry.  All that time, effort and money poured into our relationship and I have almost nothing to show for it.  I now regret ever having met you.  You lied to me about almost everything.  I was really hurt.  I still like your siblings, but I don't think I'm going to trust anyone from your family again.  I hope your parents are as horrified as they should be about what they raised.  I never want to see you again.So I then searched for a new relationship.  Someone who I could appreciate and it's obvious they want to appreciate me.  I then stumbled across you, Dragon Age: Origins.  We spent just a little time together and I quickly fell in love...			"

												I pre-ordered X-Rebirth and I think now it's the right time to give my opinion about this game. As a huge fan of X-series I have so much to say about this game, However I'll make this short because I'm just too busy and lazy to write a wall of text. The simple list will do (Public beta 4.10). Pros:- Stations are huge and they look cool (not inside thought). The several landing pads are making things little bit messy.- Ships look very nice too and they are very detailed . You can actually destroy the different parts of the enemy ship like turret, engines, jump drives, shields etc..- Capturing the ships is fun. I almost jumped in the air when I got my first K. Small fighter sized ships are useless though.- Also the crew members are nice addition.- Looking for hidden containers with long distance scanner is fun! There isn't unique stuff though...- I like the reputation system.- Engine boost and shields are using the same energy pool. It's nice addition because it makes more sense. For some reason the energy weapons doesn't need energy at all.Cons:- The Skunk is boring, ugly and and I hate my co-pilot. I really want to kick that redhead to the nearest nebula.- Main character is also boring. Actually I don't see any reason why I would like to play pre-created character in this kind of game. So begone Ren Otani with your Skunk. I couldn't care a less about your pathetic life.- Skunk has unlimited cargo space. Seriously!- AI is absolutely terrible. Especially pathfinding. It collides a lot and controlling the drones is a nightmare.- Capital ships that are following the player are very often stuck inside station structures and they can't move. Usually they are inside the station when you undock the Skunk.- Fitting the ships (yes, even capital ships) is hard coded and there aren't any options to make custom configurations.- Missiles are absolutely useless.- Constructing the space station during the plot is waste of resources. The station doesn't have any kind of purpose.- Game is crashing when trying to load quick savegame.- DirectX 9.0c even the game engine is quite new. Not acceptable.- Walking inside the stations is also boring. Most of the stations just looks the same.- Character models are ugly and there are just few different models. Not even pony tails!- Repetetive dialogues with NPC characters inside the stations is like some kind of punishment. You have to do that because that's the only way to train your crew but it's maybe the most annoying thing in whole game.- Collecting containers (that are sometimes overlapped) inside space stations is just stupid.- Egosoft has improved the GUI but it still sucks.- All the capitals ships looks about the same inside. There is no any kind of command bridge. The crew is just standing around the launchpad.- Inspecting station info -""points"" around the stations doesn't make sense.			"

												First off, I'll say that while I have played pretty much every X game (not through steam) except Albion Prelude, and most other space sim/traders, its been so long I barely remember them. I was very much in the mood for space game, and while I had heard Rebirth came out several years ago I was very disappointed to see linux support dropped. Well its back as of a few months ago! This prompted a near-instant purchase from me, after checking to see if the devs had been working on patching the horrible state the game was in at launch. I'm happy to say they have been working very hard.This review will NOT attempt to compare X:R with any of the other X games, since its been so long since I've played them. I also won't generally compare it with other similar games in the genre. However I will say that if you are considering getting X vs Elite: Dangerous, I recommend X unless you are okay with an *always*-online game, including for single player. Also, E:D doesn't support linux, which I use exclusively.Graphics:I opted into in the 4.0 beta 6 and it runs very well on my linux mint OS with a GTX 970. On ultra with 8xAA, 16xAF, I get 40-60 fps in every area I've been to, including large battles with cap ships. There are occasional (rare) times where the FPS drops to about 2-5 when docking into a station, but a quick hop to the graphics settings and re-selecting ultra fixes it right away, so I'm confident the devs will fix that issue. Obviously I can't speak to the Windows performance, but since it uses the ultra-slow dog known as DX12, YMMV and I suspect it might run worse than the linux version. Side note - I installed on a linux laptop I have with an intel 5500 and with a little tweaking to lower the settings, the game runs playably, though obviously not near 60 fps. I mention this because the system requirements state you need AMD/Nvidia, but thats not strictly true.I won't go into much detail, but this game looks absolutely breathtaking. Destroying a major component of a cap ship results in an awesome looking plume of fire and smoke, that while not realistic for space, makes for a really awesome sight. The amount of 'local' station air traffic is awesome, with a very 5th Element / Blade Runner type feel. You can get scanned by cops, and if you're carrying illegal wares for that area, you might need to hit those afterburners quick! It really helps with the overall immersion.Though I'm sure there will be a few hiccups here and there in such a massive game, so far I have encountered no major bugs, even in the linux beta! Controls:The controls with a mouse+kb are very good, so if you're not a ""joystick jockey"" then you'll still be very much able to enjoy this game. That said, there is joystick support that seems to work well enough, and gamepad support which I don't recommend. The gamepad mappings leave a lot to be desired, especially since to control throttle you must CONSTANTLY have the trigger depressed. This should have been a more traditional left trigger=throttle down, right trigger=throttle up.I personally have found after playing with all the control options (mouse, joystick, gamepad, steam controller) that a custom binding of the steam controller in non-gamepad mode works best for me. My joystick is showing its age so its just not as precise as it used to be. However if you have a steam controller this game is awesome with it. You can get my steam controller bindings in the 'Community' section, titled ""XR Non-Gamepad Bindings"". Sound:Effects are about as you'd expect for a space sim and serve the purpose, with your gun and laser and computerized voices. The music is generally quite good and the main menu music in particular (can't speak to the DLC) is great. It definitely gets me in the mood for flying. Voice acting is awful, which is typical of X games. Just turn voices off in the beginning and save your ears the trouble. In future X games I hope they drop voice acting to spend more time on launch-day polish, which has always lacked a bit in Egosoft games.Gameplay:Alright, so this is of course the meat of the game. I'm about 75% through the main plot missions, and have done a relatively small amount of side missions. The plot isn't half bad, and generally better than most games of this type. The last truly good plot I've seen in games like these was way back in Wing Commander: Privateer (yea I'm old) and its expansion. So that said, its a pretty enjoyable plot overall if you can get past the horrid voice acting or just turn it off. It'll feel a bit like an old JRPG that way. The plot missions start a bit bland, per most games of this type, but about 40% through you'll start seeing cap ship battles, a prison break thats pretty cool, and get to see a significant portion of the systems and zones. You can get up and walk around your ship, or dock with stations and walk around them. It can be somewhat rewarding to explore stations in the beginning of the game, and some stations are quite cool to look at and explore, but most use a random selection of about 5 or 6 layouts so it does get a little dull. That said it goes help with immersion if you don't like to do everything via menus like in previous games, so overall its actually a nice addition. You can, as of one of the past patches, just do pretty much everything but black market trading through menus from your ship.This game does not hold your hand, in fact it probably needs more of a hands-on tutorial to explain how to properly do trading, station building, etc. All X games have suffered from this, but my personal feeling is you should take your time to grow into these games and learn/discover for yourself as much as you can while enjoying the game and environments, so maybe thats what they intend. When you really get stuck, an online video or tutorial is just a quick search away. (Try to find a recent video as Egosoft really has changed this game dramatically since release)I have a decently upgraded main ship, and 4 'large' ships, some of which do trading missions, and some come with me on combat. Seeing and participating in a large scale combat is just awesome looking. Sadly, stations can't be destroyed, but on the plus side this makes the economy of your game harder to really screw up. Some of the 'generic' auto-generated missions are a bit vague or exploitable, however they are actively patching and improving them.I have not built a station, but the beauty of a game like this is that you can play the go-it-alone smuggler type, the economic behemoth, the private military force, heavy mining operations or just about any other type of role you might want to play that involves space + ships. I have about 20 hours of play time so far. Obviously many players and fans of X will say thats not enough for a review because I haven't done X, Y or Z. However thats not true in my opinion. I'm having a blast and have definitely got my money's worth already. Since I am not comparing this to previous X games, thats enough to write a review. Also I haven't noticed any linux reviews, so its important to write one for any linux fans who might want to know how the game runs. That said, I expect I'll be enjoyably playing this for many hundreds of hours more. I can't say that about any other game I've bought in the past 3-5 years.			"

												Purchased this game when it was first released. Promptly uninstalled it because it was terrible. Now with 4.0 the game is great.I need to compliment the developers for sticking to their game and getting it done. I have seen many games where the developers chalked a game up as a fail and just moved on leaving everyone who purchased it out to dry.Yes, this game was not great at the beginning but it is now so if you haven’t tried it yet you con confidently try it out now. If you didn’t like it before, just swallow your grumbles and give it a try not for what it was but what it is now. Without your baggage from before you might just find yourself enjoying it.			"

												Too many facets of this game are broken at the moment for me to recomend it in all good conscience. I really want to like this game and i've tried hour after hour to like it. At the moment i've taken to saving my game after every action. Board my ship. save. disembark my ship save. before i take a mission. save. after i take a mission. save. before i go into a gate. save. after i come out of a gate. save. My head stuck in the back of the chair again... restart from last save (doesnt always fix it)... The screen has started flickering and the whole application finally crashes.. (every couple hours.) The scenery has been breathtaking. I really want to love this game, but i just can't bring myself to do it. Maybe 6 to 12 months from now they will have it all straightened out and i'll come back.. but for now.. it's too glitchy to play.			"

												It was an awfully bad game at launch, which i swore never to play again.But now more than a year later, i have to admit the devs turned things around and made it an amazing game.This game definitely deserves a second chance- no more technical problems, high fps on modern pc's- beautifully rendered space stations, vibrant environments- UI has been improved a lot, much faster and more detailed,also less clutter in the cockpit.- character models are much better now- missions are more varied - the economy is indeed fully simulated nowI just wish the devs had postponed it's initial launch, because X Rebirth no longer deserves such harsh reviews and low scores			"

												150 Hour review, okey so i've been playing X-rebirth (on steam) for 150 hours now so thought why not its probably time to write a review for the game so others can see what its like. the first thing to get out of the way is NO this is not X-rebirth 1.0 that sucked and was almost umplayable and missing a lot, i'm playing on X-rebirth 3.51 atm and they have truely turned the game around and its pretty much amazing now.What i love about the gameThe thing about x-rebirth that i love is how massive the world is and the fact it is all rendered in real time with all of your owned ships, you can be just wandering around a station collecting stashes while one of your stations is receiving wares on the other side of the galaxy, or one of your patrolling ships encounters a xenon that wondered into the area. the world never stops and waits for you to finish a mission or to catch up to someone your following to continue like it does on so many other games and thats one of the things i love about it. The other major thing i love is that you control all of whats happening from your one ship, the Albion skunk you can start as just a little ship doing all the work yourself to managing a giant fleet, or a trading empire or whatever you want and its so imersive in that sense because you don't just instantly get these things you have to find ways to get the money to buy a construction vessel to start building a station, be it slowly with missions moving cargo or transporting people, or by accepting missions from the pirate factions and getting several million by causing mass chaos (at the downside of turning factions against you) you can do whatever you want.What i hate about the gameHonestly the only thing that bugs me about the game is how they haven't been able to go as far as they could of with the whole idea of the economy, yeah each faction has its own funds and stations and resources and stuff but theres still instances where it feels like ships spawn in out of nowhere instead of being built, like with some of the pirate factions in the game, they have their own stations yes but they are in now way capable of building ships or making money to supply the pirates? and the pirates don't actually raid trade shipments, they attack it then if they win they just fly off and look for another one. i can't help but feel that they could have done more with that so that pirates actually had to attack people to survive and if you fought them off enough or launched attacks on their outposts it would slow them down or eventually destroy that faction. since you can make giant empires and have fleets of 50 ships easily but you cant seem to stop a group of pirates. Communitythe only problem with the game changing so much is that when you search google for guides and stuff they are all for older versions of x-rebirth, or the wiki's are no longer up-to-date because the people who were working on them have long since given up on the game as have many fans because of how long it has taken them to get a nicely working version of it. it's also majorly effected the game's rating and put off a lot of new gamers coming to play it, but trust me this is not the same game it is a epic trading/empire/war simulation.Modswith the prospect of mods now aswell you can completely destroy people's stations and help some factions build more of their own, the mods have added a tonn of content to the game along with what there already is in it so i do recomend checking them out.Overall, if you like actually thinking about a game then get this xD its whatever you wanna do kinda game and worth the cash, if you wanna get nitty gritty into working out different productions and sabotaging other companies so your's will be able to sell stuff at higher price you can be that kinda player, but if you just like flying around shooting stuff there is that too, whatever kinda playstyle you have you can make your way in x-rebirth			"

												As you can see by my play stats I have played this game inside out and have come to this conclusion; X Rebirth has loads of potential and scope, but sadly falls way short of what it promises to be.I have sunk over 500 hours into X3 and X3TC and can say that I enjoy the X games, but this one is simply not what you would expect and to make matters worse it should have come out on Early Access. The game is nowhere complete with functionality lacking and outsight not working in certain situations. Egosoft are patching, but as I have dealt with them before this is nothing new, but still doesn't excuse the mess this game is.I have had to edit my save file numerous times just to complete the game and was rewarded by a lame end mission which comes and goes without anything happening and you are left wondering 'Ummm did I just finish the game??'. The bottom line is that they sacrificed what the X series was all about in order to attract new customers, which is a viable business strategy but is a very dangerous thing to do with a game such as X.Because of this decision you get the feeling as if the game was intended for controller use and I think was to be for next gen consoles, but at the last minute I think they pulled the game and Egosoft were left with a game made for consoles which now had to go PC. Now this is speculation, but from the UI layout and functionality it would seem as if this is what the game was geared up for and then had to be quickly ported to PC..... maybe.My final thoughts;Space looks lovely at times and flying between floating cities close to a planet looks breathtaking, but on foot in stations and other areas the lo-fi textures are all too evident. Shoddy menu management and design choices (I had to make a whole new set of UI elements as the default set is woeful), buggy/non-working game play elements, annoying travelling mini game, poor ship and NPC AI, clipping and texture issues, sound issues...... in fact let’s just wrap this up into one sentence;This game in not complete and will not be for at least another 6 months, maybe try back then.

												I have always loved the X series of games.  I have to say while this game seems to have alot of potential and I am really excited about the future of it, it is sadly in the beta stage.  It is wrought with bugs such as ships not responding, graphics disappearing, missions that are unachieveable with editing the save game file.  The rest of the universe seems to ignore you when you try to build stations and are buying materials.  I left the game running over nite to see if some npc trading would occur over time and nothing happened.  The npc characters on the stations are terriable, everywhere you go they are the same with extremely bad and constantly repeated dialog.  I have tried to overcome all these pitfalls and have spent more time researching how to change the save game file and be able to move to the next mission than I have played the game.  I think the game will be an excellant game when it is completed,  I can not believe it was sold in this state.  Anyone who had tried to play through the story line would have very quickly that the game was seriously broken.			"

												Whenever friends asked why I played the X series I always told them that buried under all the sh*t was a diamond and it was only a matter of time before enough patches and community content wiped all the crap away and exposed the games for the gems I really believed they were. They didn't believe me - they knew Egosoft's reputation for DOA game delivery (as did I) - but I kept the hope alive. And while far, FAR from perfect X3:R and X3:TC with substantial modding proved to be decent experiences in the end. We have to take what we can get in this genre - It feels like there will never be another Freespace 2.I guess hope died when X was reborn. All the problems I had hoped resolved in this game - horrible AI, ships colliding constantly, UI that can only be explained as having been designed to annoy and torment - were still present and accounted for. And then some. A lot of some. Yes, it's pretty to be sure but not pretty enough to justify the sheer terror it will run your CPU and GPU through. The campaign is nothing more than a broken tutorial. Combat with other ships is akin to a special-needs jousting contest. I could go on and on but others have done my job for me. Lamentably, Egosoft doesn't appear to be listening.I don't know why this keeps happening with Egosoft's releases. A more naive soul might blame the developers but as a developer myself I have to believe that the product management and sales of Ego's games are driving them straight into the ground. Much like what you'll be doing with the Albion Skunk should you deign to pilot her.Pass on this one. Check back again in 3 years. And don't make the mistake of buying Egosoft before the community has had a chance to find something redeeming and shiny under all this sh*t. "

												You can't really write a one-liner about this one, or make a 'pros vs. cons' review.If you want a quick summary: This game is what you make of it. Even at its current state (4.0 with existing DLCs), I simply don't see myself going back to vanilla after all the awesomeness and great fun that mods brought me.The PastYou can't really recommend the game without stating that:X Rebirth had a terrible launch, and the vanilla experience will most likely disappoint you..unless you strictly want to play the plot.Egosoft probably tried to make the best space game they could imagine, but lack of time made they cut huge chunks of the game out for the release. Even though the crazy amount of updates make up for a lot of it, certain issues are at the core of the game, like the UI, the static NPCs inside stations, and all the insane interruptions that can get to the point of preventing you to control your ship as you fly in range of enemy JET/LR [aka Instakill] Turrets.All the other issues with the game are probably down to the fact that Ego aimed at a more ""casual-ized"" experience and approach to the X series (noticeable by surprisingly including release for console platforms). Therefore, they managed to miss both X series fans (usually hardcore gamers) and more-casual players completely, making the game sit in a X-tremely awkward spot.What I mean by that is that a ""casual"" audience will probably not like the huge amount of time it takes to build a station or to obtain the items to build the Jump Drive, and the hardcore audience would probably be much more interested in investing time in their empire, waging wars or stealing cargo than scanning huge, empty areas of space and reloading the game 100 times until you manage to open a lockbox with 1 out of 10 pieces of components to craft something.With all that said, you do have to give props for the devs for such an interesting, rich and, sometimes, very immersive universe. By simply flying around or walking around stations, you can see what they were going for.I've finished the game back in version 2.0 (or 2.5). I played vanilla for a long time, and started adding mods slowly. After finishing the plot, I couldn't stand all the issues and quirks of the game and quit. It was, overall, an annoying and hurtful experience.The PresentI played a lot more with version 3.5, and in this playthrough I added more mods as the plot progressed. This made the game become extremely fun, since the game and mods were now much more stable and developed. Slowly adding more mods felt like I was buying/adding/unlocking upgrades.I had lots of fun and ignored the plot halfway through it, but there were still quirks and rough edges that made a lot of things take days - if not weeks - to achieve or obtain. So I took a long break.After 4.0 and HoL hit, I added even more mods and finished the game again, and now I'm having a blast and actually finishing constructing stations and growing a trade and a military fleet.All this thanks to SETA and a mod that makes CapShips jump around faster without refueling. Those two things alone make the game playable on a less insane level. I mean, if you wait for buses for 60 minutes in real life, you don't really want to wait more than half an hour for your fleet to refuel, traverse Jump Gates, and jump to you..only to wait all that again once you're done doing things on the System you were at.Of course, this is my personal opinion. I played for over 70 hours without changing the game's 'pacing', and the original pacing does make everything much more satisfying once achieved. But it gets old - especially if you don't want to spend weeks to achieve certain things.ConclusionThis game was a crazy attempt by Egosoft at developing something totally new for them, and an amazing display of how modders can completely change, fix and turn quirks and horrible issues completely around.The living universe is, as always, beautiful. The NPCs messaging you about issues with their budget, or checking with your Architect the state of your new station's construction, or even the silly detail of mass traffic around stations and highways will truly make your mind wander like very few other games can. Even with all the quirks (mostly fixed), you can't help but feel the love and dedication of developers and artists when flying around stations and looking at their tiny details. It's really insane how such a small team have produced so many inspiring stuff over so many years. I can only hope that Ego hears the community and make even better stuff from now on.A quick overview of the game's characteristics before I run out of space:Graphics looks beautiful, the game Sounds great (except for some sounds that are way too loud or slightly annoying, and certain music loops gets old fast), the VOs are much better than previous games (and I still freaking love Betty) - you WILL eventually need mods to make a lot of interactions silent, though. I appreciate a lot the effort for making the game more alive and real, but making certain dialogs/comms unskippable makes it unbearable after the 100th time. The Plot and Plot Missions are WAY better than before (but could do with many improvements). As with any and all X games - forever - could do with optimizations. But since 4.0 I had ZERO crashes, and many performance issues are probably caused by one or more of the +85 mods I use.The Gameplay and flying around feels much more personal and fun than previous titles, even though you'll probably have to remap controls to suit your tastes/needs.There's a decent variety of Ships and Missions to choose from, and enough freedom to let you focus on certain activities and completely ignore other ones - just like previous titles. You can, however, only pilot one ship (the Skunk), which is a weird design choice.The Trading is probably the most disappointing aspect for previous players, as it's completely manual. Utter madness! Mods will save you here, though.The character limit won't enable me to state all of the remaining games positive and negative features.So, as stated initially, ""this game is what you make of it"". If you love space games, or the X Universe, I trust you are one of those that are willing to take the time to tailor the game to suit your tastes.It's not great to recommend a game based on it's mods - but the X series is unique enough to make it worth it.

												It's honestly with a heavy heart that I do not recommend X: Rebirth.First some backstory.I first got into the X series with X3: Terran Conflict.  It was intimidating and daunting, but I got it during a sale, and I figured that I should at least invest some time into it.  While it was a rocky start at first, I managed to learn the ropes and have myself a good time with space combat and trading.  Excited, I bought Albion Prelude, and got even more enjoyment due to the improvements upon the systems.  The addition of the stock market, for example, was very much appreciated.Soon after playing Albion Prelude, I heard about the development of X: Rebirth.  Promising to be more accessible but just as deep, I became incredibly excited.  Bohemia Interactive had promised something similar with ARMA3 and they delivered on their promise.  I expected just the same from Egosoft- and why not?  They had been working on the X series for more than 10 years- they knew what their fans wanted and expected.At least... They should've known.But X: Rebirth put my faith into Egosoft into doubt.X: Rebirth is nothing short of a mess.First off, the game is poorly optimized, with framerate drops quite abundant in the earlier areas and very apparent across the campaign.  Some areas are not quite as bad, but it's very clear that there was minimal QA done.  The computer I use is very powerful but even then it chugs with Rebirth.  Secondly, things are buggy.  Ships under your command behave strangely, trading sometimes does not carry out, and orders can be backed up with no way to cancel them.  Saying that it is a test of patience would give too much credit to the game- it is downright broken.  Patches have fixed some of the problems, but many still hang around.Thirdly, the elements Egosoft touted for immersion are of poor quality.  From the number of character models to the interiors to the voice acting...  The detail is not even up to 2008 standard, much less a game being released in 2013.  This could be forgiven somewhat if it wasn't for the fact of how repetitious many of these elements were.  There's probably only about five or so voice actors across the entire game, all with equally wooden delivery.  Ren Otani's VA is the best, but that's best in the sense of ""Of all the moldy sandwiches in the fridge, this one has the least amount of mold.""Minigames have been put in place, but they feel incredibly out of place in a game meant to be a space trading simulator.  Tapping buttons to time ""convince"" meters for small-talk or zipping behind ships to speed through the highways are elements intended for action-focused games, not simulators.But perhaps most heartbreaking of all, the game is missing so many features that made the past X games great.  The radar system is now gone, as well as readouts for speed and distance.  Combat has been given more of a focus but it has lost its complexity and tactical thought.  The elements that should help with establishing a gian trade empire are gone, such as trade automation.This is not the X game that we were promised.There ARE some things in X: Rebirth that are worthwhile.  The detail put into the universe is nothing short of incredible.  The low texture resolution can be forgiven as there is now a true sense of scale to the world- the highways, one of the most impressive elements in X: Rebirth, zip you from sector to sector, which can range from stations located in the center of a broken planet to derelict but surviving facilities only tens of thousands of miles away from a star.  It's awe-inspiring, flying around in space.The base of X: Rebirth is not terrible.  It has given us a more moddable engine capable of a very detailed universe.  But sadly, it should've been more.  Knowing Egosoft, they will work tirelessly to patch and fix the game, but the damage has been done- I've lost a lot of my trust in them.  After being so enthusiastic about a game, I honestly feel betrayed.Perhaps in a few months, the game may become what I expected.  When that time comes, I'll revisit this review.			"

												From ""Hot mess"" to downright fun.   This game on release made me sick, I have been there for ego's other releases, this one was by far the worse.  I didnt think it was fixable, but honestly I was suprised, they kept slogging along and now it is actually pretty fun to play.  It still has a learning curve and still has a couple rough edges, but if you like space trading games it is one of the best now.  If you like empire building games with a space setting,  it is one of the only ones (except all the other X series games of course)			"

												*Listens quietly for the sound of nails being hammered into wood* I so wanted to love this game even after having come to the X-universe late but X-Rebirth isn't so much a Rebirth as it is a nail in the coffin. Yes, the Teladi outpost DLC fixed a few things but it doesn't change the fact that Egosoft threw out almost everything good about the X3's and gave us... This.ProsThe graphics are simply stunning. I cannot deny the vista's are utterly jaw droppingThe music is sweeping and epicNew sector system-In the previous game each 'map' was one sector which had so many stations, ships and jump gates leading to other sectors. The downside to this is that they had a rather definitive edge to them and expanding beyond the default size of a given sector was difficult. In Rebirth they have highways linking regions withing sectors so that they are now exponentially biggerConsThe highway system to enable FTL travel between regions means they decided to do away with the SETA drives. Singularity Engine Time Accelerator. In a nutshell, it would speed the game up to a maximum factor of %1000 to allow you to cross even massive sectors rapidly however here your only options to move swiftly are to take the highways, which are fixed and only link between regions one way or to boost your way across at speeds not all that much greater than your normal. However that introduces annother problem:Boosting drains your shield. Fair enough, in the last game boosting would eat away at your shield but only if you didn't have enough energy cells to power it. In Rebirth your only options are to arrive at a fight late, or with your shield depleated.Steering is either by joystick (and it doesn't have pre-built profiles so you have to bind everything manualy) or by cursor flight. Either pointing at a spot on the screen and clicking the mouse until you're poiting where you want to go or by moving the mouse around on the screen and it will keep turning that way. Now, for those of us without a joystick this can act as a virtual stick, meaning we don't have to move our mice up and reset them mid-manouver however it also feels difficult and can serve to dull reaction times. This was an option in the previous games but that's where the problem lies. It was an OPTION. Here you have no choice in it.The Ship. Now, as I recal in the first X games you only had on ship you could be in, fair enough it was a while ago in computing terms and resources were limited however they soon corrected this to the point where you could fly around in just your space suit, a small one man scout ship, bombers, corvettes, frigates, destroyers, carriers or even, if you had balls that clanked as you walked, The Valhalla. A ship so large it can't actually fit through a gate. In Rebirth, you're stuck in one ship. This wouldn't be an issue if the ship were any good but it isn't. From the top:It's name is the Albion Skunk. I don't know who thought of this but in the previous games it was named the Albion Pride. And no, you can't even change it's text. I might be able to live with it if your co-pilot (more on her in a sec) didn't say it every time you came into dockThe ship computer from previous games makes a comback, I'd gotten used to her and quite liked the announcements she made but here, the only thing more irritating than 'Betty' the computer is Yisha the co-pilot telling Betty to shut upThe speed is not great, made all the worse by the lack of aformentioned SETA drive and the only boost feature eating up your shieldDrones, missiles and weapons are all limited. And you only get one gun... One. You can have a few on your ship at a time but you can only shoot one. Even the samallest, least combat capable scout ships in X3 Albion Prelude have two. And of course, you are stuck in this one ship. Sure, you can get out and walk on stations but you have to come back to it sooner or later. Or spend the rest of your life running the vents like a rat, trying to make a living out of oddly placed credits and random junk you can sell. Either or. Frankly, I'd choose vent rat			"

												Lastest update 1.30 patch makes this game very playable. The X-Series games are sandbox after the storyline campaign. The campaign is huge and everything works, of course there are tips on the forums for some parts. I stopped using all the mods and really enjoy the vanilla game now. Once you have your first station running you will see how much depth in trading you have to manage. Assign some ships to your station and they will take over some of it for you.Space is beautiful and the universe is much larger than even X3 Albion Prelude. It is divided differently, but not smaller. I have a fleet of ships patrolling sectors and many transports running wares all over trying to keep my business profits up. Every transport destroyed has an impact on the market due to the products it would have carried.There are many ways to edit your 'save files' but I've learned that it spoils the game. The fun of winning, for me, is gained by figuring out how to earn the credits and build your empire and not just giving yourself millions of credits. When you play this game just be prepared to spend many hours/days/weeks learning about the markets and the universe. Egosoft does make it easy to start playing, but the depth of their previous games is still here in X-Rebirth. Bookmark this website:  http://roguey.co.uk/xrebirth/waresI expect to be playing this game for a long time. If you got this game months ago and had problems, try it again now. It's a beautiful game now.			"

												2.20 ReviewWhen I was first set loose in X: Rebirth's vast universe, right after it's release, I was convinced it was going to be amazing.  But I quickly realised that this was, in fact, a colossal supernova of bugs and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game design that refuses to let you have any fun – and I really tried. I forgot about the game for a while, and came back to play the 2.20 update, hoping that the game would be fixed by now. I was disappointed, again.First problem: you only get to pilot one ship, the horribly named Albion Skunk. You're able to explore it using a first-person mode, which could have been fun if there were more than two rooms to it, and if anything was even slightly interactive. The cockpit is cluttered and restrict your vision horribly, and it took me a good while to find some of the most important HUD elements, such as the speedometer. Which isn't that well done either. Eventually I found a guy that sells different cockpits, ehich there are four of. And so, I was saved from the horrors of the stock cockpit by bying the very open, combat-oriented one.If I remember correctly EgoSoft said that there's only one ship to incease immersion and that they couldn't have made the capitalship gameplay fun while keeping the mobility realistic. Well, changeing ships has worked just fine in the other games. I would've paid extra for the ability to change into something with more than one gun. Even if it was just a frikin' shuttle.Then there's your co-pilot, Yisha. For a character you spend the entire game with, and who's almost constantly talking, you'd think they would have hired someone with some basic acting ability to speak her lines. But while you'll eventually grow used to her awkward delivery, you'll never stop cursing how useless she is. Case in point: if you're piloting a drone, and enemies start attacking the Skunk, she'll just sit there dumbly. Couldn't you, like, move, or fight back, or something? Not to mention her, and everyone else's, bad animations and ridiculous outfits. Oh, and a boob-window on a spacesuit. Because logic.Second problem: The voice acting. Oh god, the voice acting is absolutely horrible. It has to be mentioned multiple times. I could rate this game negative just because of it, but there's so much more. The game has a big problem with humans in genereal. On stations – which all look identical – you'll talk to NPCs, who are terrifying, slot-mouthed, dead-eyed mannequins. While space itself feels nicely alive, teeming with traffic and huge ships lumbering back and forth, the interiors feel lifeless and boring. In a nightclub I hear the ambient sound of people drinking and laughing, but it's empty except for two people standing motionless by the bar. Thankfully you don't really have to enter stations anymore, you now can do all interaction straight from your ship. But since it's done as a video conversation with the character you're speaking to, there's no escape from the animations and voice acting.How about something positive for a change? Stations aside, Rebirth fares much better when you're in space. Ignoring some messy shadows, it's a good-looking game, with colourful nebulas, asteroids, planets and star. The combat is like jousting in space. Ships make passes at each other, firing a volley of shots when they get close and hoping some connect. Or you can use heatseeking missiles. Hit the spacebar and you can strafe, FPS-style. Hit it again to steer with the mouse. The movement feels nicely weighty.Except that the Skunk can only mount one weapon at a time, which are all extremely underpowered compared to the fact that enemies can mount multiple ones, and have near-perfect aim. Missiles are nice, and one of the only ways to make combat work for me. The other is to fly to a station and hope the turrets kill the hostiles before you die.Third problem: you have separate ships for trading that follow you around and have to be given orders. You couldn't, and still can't, buy any trade-goods with your own ship, everything has to be done with slow and dumb freighters that can't even fight pirates reliably, despite the 20 turrets that are mounted on them. You can't cancel an order without editing your save file, and sometimes the freighter just refuses to move, breaking the entire save and preventing the plot from progressing. It's like I'm dragging a badly-behaved toddler around a shopping centre. Thank god they've fixed most of those bugs by now, but the trading UI is still slightly confusing at times and the ships are still ridiculously dumb.The UI... It's confusing and mostly useless.It's designed to work around a controller, on a PC-exclusive title.There's so much done wrong with this game, even this full A4 page of text is just the beginning. No matter what happens with stability and bug-fixing patches, its poor controls, awful interface, and dull pacing ensure that X Rebirth will remain unpleasant for all but the most forgiving, die-hard space jockeys. And oh god, the voice-acting...			"

												Promising sequel of the great X series, it's resulted flawed by many bugs and, most important, terrible, terrible, design decisions. First, the good part: - Improved space graphic: the ships, the effects, the stations and the sky is/are simply amazing;- Most of the core mechanics of the previous X games are imported here (like owning many ships/stations, complex economic system, boarding system, etc..);- Fast travel system: they made the sectors both wide and easy to travel in a very nice way- Living space: the stations feels (and are) alive, with many ships that docks and leave anytime while security patrols keeps things safe- Subsystems: the fact that you can target specific subsystems was a very requested improvement, glad they added itNow the bad part:- The interface is almost unusable. Such complexity was handled in all the previous games with many (but simply) buttons and tables on the hud, now all you have is a small (and dark) multi-level radial menu. That means that most of the options are hidden on sub-levels, and even if you know where to look, it will takes 4-5 inputs before your action will be performed. The radial menu is great for chatting alternatives (and such) on rpgs, but it's awful if you want to submit orders and visualize the status of your ship;- You can directly control just one, single, ship. You can still submit orders to other ships, but instead a single table, you have to ""speak"" with the person you hired to work on that ship (see radial menu concerns above). Actually this can be a minor issue, since the ship is highly moddable and the drone system somewhat mitigate the problem, but forget to jump into your newly conquered ship. Those times are gone, egosoft declared;- The indoor experience: It's not about the 10-years old models/textures of the interior; It's not about the awful ""thief-like"" minigame inside it; It's not about the time lost in the search of a specific guy to hire in order to use the extra ship you got (a thing that was simple&free in the previous X games). It's about all of that, and much more. At this state, it's just an ugly and useless feature that should be re-designed, if not removed alltogether.- Awful dogfighting system. The lack of basilar stuff like the gravidar and the targeting controls (both presents on the previous X) makes the fighting somewhat problematic;- Doubleclicks everywhere: from the start menu to the last ship that comes your way, if you want to perform a mouse action on an item, you need to double click it. Forget the ""mouseOver"" events, do you want to make a new game? one click to select ""new game"" button, and one click to confirm. Do you want to modify a setting? double click there. and so on..Not a real trouble, but very, very, annoying on the long run.. - Console port of a game never released on console: The FoV cap. The GUI size (and usability). The low-res textures. The small (aka ultra-compressed) data size. The ""xbox"" references all over the code. All of these details (and even more) points out to just one direction -> console port. How a game never release on console can be so consol-ish?  some people got a reasonable answer to this question[forum.egosoft.com]. - Terrible FPS and many bugs: Many people got a very low framerate even on high end machines. Others suffers of crashes and many other bugs. This might not be a big issue if they will fix them, but at this state of the game, the point stands.My opinion is to stick with X3:AP which is the best out of the series, and enjoy the X world until the Egosoft will address to all these issues or, more likely, will give us the real X4A man can dream, can't he?

												Despite having been released over a year ago and receiving many patches, the game still severely underperforms on high-end hardware and does not have compelling gameplay. Expect to spend 80% of your play time flying back and forth through transparent space tubes, 10% flying around space stations within 10 meters of the hull to scan information points and giving trade orders to your ships, and the last 10% pew-pewing spaceships with one weapon at a time.Here are some of the game's shortcomings:Boring gameplay consisting mostly of flying through space tubes, as if you're playing some sort of public transit passenger simulator rather than a space game.Vastly fewer weapon options with no ability to fire multiple weapons simulatenously.You can only pilot one ship unlike previous games, where you had hundreds of choices in many ship categories, from scouts to carriers to freighters.All objects in space are inexplicably surrounded by protective bubbles that absorb all damage from collisions, making the few precious moments spent outside space tubes even less exciting.A lot of tasks needlessly require the player's presence, such as chauffeuring ship officers from stations to the ships where they are to work.When talking to NPCs, you must wait for them to finish talking before your commands take effect, given the fact that a particular zone may have dozens of NPCs of the same type offering their services, this makes finding specific goods very annoying.You are forced to use a cockpit, wasting 30% of your screen on what is essentially a static model with some flashing lights here and there. A discreet HUD overlaid on an unobstructed view of space would be vastly superior for many players.The draw distance is depressing, with objects conspicuously popping in as you travel inside space tubes.The 4 different sectors are basically palette swaps of each other with a few cosmetic differences (a cracked planet here, some space debris there, etc).The script and voiceovers quite obviously weren't done by native speakers, resulting in strange and immersion-breaking dialogue and pronunciation.Character models and station interiors are very low-quality.The Teladi look like E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. This would be funny if it weren't so tragic.Your co-pilot's jumpsuit has an embarrassing boob window that betrays a lack of respect for the playerbase.The game does feature a few improvements, however they hardly justify all its shortcomings:Capital ship components can be damaged individually, adding depth to capital ship combat.More piracy options, now you can not only extort and salvage enemy ships, but also hack them to release cargo.Station complexes now exist as superstructures rather than individual stations connected by spaghetti strands.

												After replaying this after the 3.0 patch, and with a fresher mindset, i feel I can give this game a fairer review.In a word, X rebirth, is alright. I really wish steam reviews had a better system than a thumbs up or down, because I do not believe this game to be praiseworthy, but neither should it be within the mostly negative on the steam page.It is not by any means a bad game, but it is not a great one either. I still feel if you are wanting to get into the X series, to start you should play X2: the threat or X3: Terran conflict (or Albion prelude, AP is essentially an expansion for TC anyway) however on its own, X Rebirth stands a good space 4X first person space simulator. It has some nice looking paint, a tutorial that is excellent for teaching new players to the X series (whereas before, the game plonked you into a grand universe, without even controls to do anything, with the exclusion of X3, where there is a flight school, that simply tells you how to move your ship. To start this mission, you must open communications with it, which the game neglets to give you the command to do so) Many people were also afraid of the bugs when it first came out. Most of the serious bugs have now been squashed, and the game playable, there are still errors that can be easily seen, but thankfully none that impact the gameplay massivly (the worst ive seen is a group of NPC ships getting stuck together). Although I feel that Ego was going for a major shift in gameplay, alienating many fans of the X series. I do not think that this was made to be a Space management game. Trading takes too long, and profits made during runs are often not worth the time. However, I feel that Ego was going for a more, action RPG type game, and tried to blend the X formula into it. For example, combat is a lot more profitable now, than in previous games. Repairs for your vessel could cost upwards to a few million credits in any previous X game. Here, it should cost less than 100 grand, no matter your hull. This isnt even accounting for the seemingly Hyperinflation that occured during the time of Rebirth, money is no longer measured in the hundreds of thousands, but in up to 4 digits. For example, say I had 5,264,194 credits in my account. Any previous game would show that as 5,264,194, here it is shown as 5.264M. It does not go into detail about exactly how much money you have, which would be necessary in a detailed management game. The speed of combat, and the changes in the combat system have also been changed to be a lot more faced paced. Another change to make it into a more robust Action game. There have only been a few instances in which the player was actually given a character, however those were really only referenced in the main plot missions, and then it was simply by name most of the time. Here Ren Otani (thats you) is not only given a name, but a voice and a very slight personality. He can walk around on ships, engage in talks with other people, and the player now actually thinks about who it is driving their ship, rather than the mystical being who manifestes as a space suit.I shall be continuing this review as i get further into the game, but for now, a TLDR section.X Rebirth, is not worth $40, it is an okay Space sim, with some light space managerial options and a heavy emphases on combat. It is a good game for new players into the X series to try out to get used to the ideas of how a X game operates, before moving onto a previous title if they are intrested in the management and stratergy of those games. But for now, pick up the game on sale (for $15-20 bucks or less), itll be worth your time if you havent tried out the X series and wanted to learn about it, although this game is not an accurate representation of how a X game operates. Although, space exploration is an absolute pain in this game, and areas quickly become generic.			"

												I preordered this game and it crushed my hopes completely then.  However the game has come a long way from when it was first launched.  Egosoft has done a lot of work in bringing the game to functionality.  They had rushed it to market way before it was ready.  If the game would have come out in the state it is in now it most likely would have been a hit.  I currently have over 800hrs playing this game in all of its states and can say I can get enjoyment out of it.  Is it a $50 game? No.  But if you can get it on sale it is definitely a game you can waste some of your time in.  The modding community has helped this game out greatly and thus are recommended for a better experience.   The only thing this game truly lacks is a comprehensive modding suite.  The ability to truly add new ships and stations to this game would expand it's possibilies.   The game is now stable and recommended.			"

												I'm very sorry not to be able to recommend this game, because Egosoft clearly put a tremendous amount of effort into improving what was an unmitigated disaster of a game at launch two and a half years ago.  To their credit, they've come a long way and made some good progress on this one.  I can at least say that any product you get from Egosoft, they will absolutely stand by both it and you 100%.Unfortunately there are still some big problems.  There is currently no good way to control and issue orders to large fleets of player controlled ships.  Even when issuing orders to a single vessel, you actually have to engage in a conversation with the captain of that ship to tell them to do something.  20 seconds to issue a single command?  Not good.  Especially not good in combat situations.The campaign was an attempt to train the player in all the things they can do in the X Rebirth universe, but it doesn't do a great job.  For example, you are shown how to board a ship.  What it doesn't tell you is that the team of 8 marines you do this with would NEVER be able to take a similar ship during the real game, most especially not one at full health.  Thus when you attempt your first real capital ship capture, you are met with spectacular failure no matter how many times you reload until you finally hit the forums to discover that you've been misled.  Also, now that you've captured your story scripted ship, how does one go about fueling and repairing it?  No explanation given in game.  To the forums, once again!  Not acceptable given the campaign itself is supposed to be answering these sorts of questions.X-Rebirth has come a long way since launch, and I would definitely do business in the future with a company like Egosoft, who so clearly stand by their products.  But can I recommend this one for a full $30 price tag?  No.  Sadly, I still cannot.  Perhaps some day.			"

												Paying over $10 for this game will leave you with severe buyer's remorse. If you just want facts, skip the next 2 paragraphs.To begin, I'll state that if you've played X3: Reunion/Terran Conflict/Albion Prelude and loved them, this is not a sequel, spiritual successor or anything along those lines. X Rebirth falls under the ""inbread abomination"" category. It borrows heavily from the lore, but not from any of the concepts that made the previous titles fun to play.Don't be fooled by the positive reviews, half of them aren't even consistently deluded. With comments like ""10/10"" then individually listing the areas of the game as followed ""Sound: 6/10, Graphics: 8/10, Gameplay: 4/10. Totally loved it"" it's as if the positive reviews came from people either associated with the company or from people so dissapointed that they decided a drunken review to sucker more people out of their money was the best alternative to admitting this game was a flop. Graphics: Nothing special here and if it runs on your computer properly it can be very pretty at times, about 50% of the uses are consistantly reporting massive framerate issues even after 6+ months of release. It uses directx 9, which is several generations old at this point and most believe this was due to it's, all but confirmed by the devs, origins as a console port. Sound: The voice acting is mediocre to bad, it's repetitive too so there is really no way around listening to it.  Controls: Severly limiting, more complicated than previous ""X"" titles due to a complete failure to streamline them into a simpler form. No initial support for flightsticks on a space sim, the menus you use to navigate and control your *cough* ""empire"" *cough* are obviously designed around the limitations of a primarily controler driven interface, they took the menus from previous titles, removed them, then added in even more awkward and convoluted replacements that are twice as hard to navigate and produce half (if even that) the intended results.  Gameplay: If you like ultra repetitive minigames where you ping the map then blow up space debris for money, you'll love this game. If you like reflex minigames where you get to hear horrible voice acting, repeated over, and over, and over etc. you'll love this game. Your ship, The Albion Skunk, is essentially invincible and overtuned to the point that it's almost not fun. The ships in your fleet can't be directly controlled, they can only be given very, very basic orders and they often decide the best thing to do is follow you instead of completing those orders. These ships die or just dissapear because they're probably as sick of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game as you are at this point. Don't waste your money on this game, the only thing they did right was hyping the hell out of it to sell copies and even then it's arguable if that truly was the right thing. After this stinker, I'd be hard pressed to see how Egosoft expects to sell another game in this franchise to anyone.			"

												I enjoyed X3 Terran Conflict a lot and was very happy when I saw this game. But after playing it a few hours now (waiting for patches to make it run ok on my machine) I have to accept that this is nothing like the X3 I enjoyed so much.This is a console game. It's extreamly beautiful in space when you fly around but it feels like you're in a FPS game and not in a space trade sim. I hate the huge space stations with tine little dots you have to fly around and find to interact with. The space station you can (or should i say forced to) walk into.... terrible. Horror. It was cool the first time. The 2nd time it was annoying. The 3rd time I had to dock, watch the animated transitions as I exit my ship and walk into the space station to find some NPC I could only think about if there was ANY way to completely skip this... The animated transitions for everything. I hate it. I want to click somewhere and get a instant window with possible choices and issue my commands. I do NOT want to watch animated screens in the ship cockpit move up and down.  I just wish I could radio all NPCs from my ship and never ever have to set my foot in the space stations. And the voice acting... holy crap. I don't want to trade in this game because of the repetitive NPC speeches when you trade with them.X3:TC was hard to get into at first but once you understood it... it's a awesome game. This game only has one improvement over X3 and that is the graphics in space. Every single other feature is a HUGE step backwards.I'm not sure patches will fix this game. The gameplay itself and the overall gameplay design is just so bad. Performance and bugs can be fixed but this game needs a huge gameplay change to get fixed, I'm not sure it is possible. They have to remove so much to fix it it would be like starting from scratch with a new game.If you are interested in space game where you fight, trade, explore and build X Rebirth is NOT the game you are looking for.

												The Good: (Yes there is some.) The space graphics while not Crysis are not bad in my opinion for something of this scale. I liked the new transit system as the gate system from X3 was feeling really dated. In general I liked the interface for this X game better than X3. X3 felt like a where's waldo game when you were trying to find the right command or menu for what you were looking for.  Some would chock up some of this as cut features (and it is to a large degree a simplier game than previous installtions), but I still think they did a better job with the interface this time around. It was easier to tell what a specific weapon was going to do or what effect it was going to have on my ability to fight. Hooray for not having an ai that suicide bombs into asteroids like in X3 too.The Bad: The graphics when in a space station are ♥♥♥♥ poor by any standard today. The textures and models for NPCs are worse. There isn't a lot of variety in this game. You only get to actually pilot one ship. The dialog lines repeat...a lot! I've heard the same string of dialog from the same person 3 times in the course of 2 minutes and I didn't try to make them talk either.The Ugly: The bugs, oh god, the bugs.  I can't say I wasn't expecting this one though. I challenge anyone to name a game of this scale that hasn't had a lot of bugs. It's just inevitable with this size of a game where it's not a linear game like Call of Duty. That isn't an excuse for them releasing it this way, but take it for what it is. The game made me rather nauesous, but I can't put my finger on why. I suspect it was somethign to do with the FOV, but I haven't had issues like this with any other game so I don't know. Trading is done now by docking and actually walking to the trader. This is nice at first, but tedious after a while when a vendor only sells a few of each ware. It makes it hard to trade. On the other hand there are little ""trade hubs"" for lack of a better term that allow you to dock on them and buy or sell a resource en-mass. Though it took me a while to find them. It was still really restrictive and I only ever seemed to find basic wares with this method. Summary: This game isn't ready for purchase unless you're willing to deal with the ""The Ugly"" section mentioned above. I hope they can make another X game and that this doesn't kill the company because I liked where they were going with some of the stuff they added.			"

												I play and review games a bit different. I review games as what they are and not as what they should be. So, I'll take this game as it is today and ask: Is it a good game? Preface Note that I didn't play the campaign, so I can't say anything about that. Not because I didn't like it, but because I never played any campaign in the X series. I like the sandbox playstyle.Also note I got all the DLC's so I am talking about the game with all DLCs. This is not a review of the base game.What you get when you enter this game is your ship and a huge universe. The structure of the universe and travellingWith the DLCs you get new sectors in that universe where you have no highways at all -- while in the original universe you got highways that make travelling faster. Having highways or not... for me a universe in a space sim game has to be believably big. The keyword here is believably. And from my point of view X Rebirth has that. The universe is huge. In X Rebirth the universe is divided into galaxies, each galaxy ( there are 8 ) has sectors and within those sectors you've got zones. Galaxies are connected through huge jumpgates, like the gates that connected setors in X3. The sectors in X Rebirth are connected through superhighways, where you fly through, but faster. And the zones are connected... Well in some sectors, some zones are connected by highways. You can enter and leave those highways at any point of the way, but you can also fly all the way with your ship and explore. There are entire sectors without a single highway. Your ship has a boost, but the energy for your boost is taken from your shield energy. So it will not last forever.Another way to travel faster than boosting through the universe (besides highways if they exist) is the new jumpdrive for your playership. There were some mods in the past that provided a jumpdrive, but now it was implemented by the developer. Random Missions This game started with a pretty small variaty of missions. That definetly changed. You got a huge variaty of missions, from assassination over smuggling, patrol, building (stations) requests, trading requests (deliver wares to a station), escort missions ( escort VIP ships to their target location and defend them), crafting and some more I don't remember right now. All are available at different difficulty levels. And then you got complex missions which I like most. Those are missions that combine a lot of different types of missions to a small storyline. It's not like a campaign, but it is a mission where you have to fulfill a varitaly of quests that are connected through a small story, which adds to immersion a lot. I didn't find many of those missions, but I really enjoyed the ones I played. Fighting In X Rebirth you can fight with your player ship and in a fleet with other ships you bought. Many people complain that the fleet control is not good. Well, that is true. It's pretty cumbersome to give other ships in your fleet commands. All ships in your fleet will attac what ever attacs you, but other than that, there is no simple way to command ships. But my problem about fleets is not the controls. My problem is how the game calculates the simulation when you are in the same area as the fight. In short: If you are in the same zone, your ships fight pretty bad while when you are not there watching it, they fight much better. There are some mods to optimize that, but it will probably never be perfect. I found something that works for me... though, I like to fight alone much more in this game.Your playership can only load one weapon at the time. That means, you have a variaty of weapons that you can load, but you have to choose one. So you can fire your plasma cannon, and then switch over to the heavy mining laser ( which can be a deadly weapon too) but you can't fire both at the same time. I didn't really like that when I started the game. But I realized that it adds a small layer of strategy into the fight. Your weapons are all usefull for different purposes: Some are strong against shields... others do better hull damage. They also have different ranges. Because you can not fire all your weapons at once, you got to know which weapon is strong in which situation. When I found out that I can optimize my damage by a rotation through my weapons during a fight, I really started to enjoy this kind of fight.You have missles available, but you also have to load one kind of missle and use it and then switch over to another one to use another type of missle. Boarding Boarding ships is a huge part of X Rebirth. It is probably the best way to earn money, but it's also a more complicated way. I'll try to explain the most important parts:The first thing you want to do, is hire a marine officer. That officer will command your marines when you board a ship. Now you need troopers which you can hire from a Recruiting Officer. As soon as you have both, you can try to board another ship. To get your troopers on a ship they will fly in tiny kind of shuttles, so you got to make sure they are not shot on thher way. All ships in the X universe have their own staff on board, which will fight your troopers when you try to board a ship. To weaken the enemy you have to destroy surface elements on that ship and bring the hull down to a low percentage. You should do that before you send your troopers, otherwhise you will fail. It's very important to destroy the ship's jumpdrive first, when you attac. Ships can be repaired by their engineer during a fight. It is slow, of cause, but you should be aware of it, as the jumpdive or the engines could start working again after you destroyed them. Trading There is not much to say about trading. You can buy ships that can transport huge amounts of wares. You can add those ships to your fleet, but you don't have to. You got two menus to manage your trading actions. The standard trading menu will show you all the offers and demands and you can figure out what would be a good deal. That can be profitable, but it takes time to find good deals. But you got a second menu where you get the best deals in a list and you can see what the profit will be. So you simply click on one of the deals and it will add the buy and sell operation to the ship's trading queue. Ships can only queue up 3 operations ( buy or sell ) at once when you start the game. But you can buy software upgrades for your computer to make more operations available.Another layer of trading is the item trade system. Items are things you have in your player's inventory. Those can be looted when you enter a station, or you can find boxes of loot with you scanners all over the universe. You can sell them or craft with them. Crafting There are a variaty of items you can craft in your inventory from items you looted. Some of them are items that can be gifted to NPC's during a smalltalk to get special offers from them. But you can also craft a unique engine and spectial items that are needed to hack into stations. Hacking You can hack into the computers of any station in X Rebirth in order to sabotage the station. I will not describe all the things you can achieve by hacking, but let me tell you that it can be very profitable. You will need to practice it a bit though, it's not simple. Review I tried to cover as much as I could, probably in too much detail. I reached max characters in this review and I didn't even cover station building, which should be in this list.Is it a good game after all? Yes it is. It is a universe full of enemies, missions, and opportunities. It has flaws, of cause. Every game has flaws. But none of them break the game for me.			"

												Simply put, this game is incredibly badly designed. The trailer and description of what the game is, are as accurate as Aliens: Colonial Marines was to it's demo, or possibly even far worse. Reading through the description of what the game is supposed to do is actually more fun than playing the game. You get more fun counting the lies and laughing about how absolutly untrue the description of the game is. It's like if someone runs up to you and starts telling blatently obvious lies, you smile and probably get a chuckle or two. That is at least enjoyable. This game is an anomaly in itself. It is broken to the core. It is actually designed wrong, and to work against itself. I have never in my life experienced anything as fustrating as this game, never. I don't think the developers even know what a video game is, seriously. The absolute basic ""unwritten"" standards of gaming do not exsist in this game. Simple things like telling the player what things are. Letting you know what to do. Things like pressing I for inventory, or, even the option to map it to a key (Inventory is not mapable to any keys!!!)No instructions or idea as to how to do things, it just tells you to do them. Many items in game have a description saying ""no description"". There is a limited 6 button radial in-game menu, where one option is next page..  and sometimes has 4 or so pages worth of options, on a 60+ button controller (The KEYBOARD!!!)Seven year development time.. What were they doing? Why aren't the most basic standards of gaming in here.Why did the game have game breaking bugs on mission 1 and 2. How did it get released? Did anyone even try to play the game first? Was there even 1 single game tester? In seven years of development, you never figured out that the first couple missions have game breaking bugs!?!?!?!?Horrible frame rate unless you own a low end - mid spec PC. That's right, the more powerful your computer / graphics cards are, the worse the game runs.. Wow. Like I said, this game is an anomaly.Stations are copied and pasted hundreds of times each, with a total variety of maybe 3 or 4 at most. Why not release an editor, and ask people to submit station designs, then you load them into the game for free. Name it after the creator. Why not? People will do it for free for you.Why are the developers so terrible at what they do? How is it possible. I know I will never ever buy another game before reading a review ever again. I will never buy a pre-order ever again, and I will never ever buy enything from Egosoft again.What an accurate name too, I bet their ego's are very soft after this absolute worthless unfinished joke of a ""game"" was released.Want a score? Out of ten? Ok,  give it 2 / 101 point for being at least somewhat nice looking1 point for future potential... (From the modding community, not the devs)			"

												This will never be good. Would be better to abandon this altogether and make a real X game. Bought the DLC thinking its fun. Still no jumpdrive. Still no autopilot. Tried to find the sector where the mission starts. Haha flying there takes about 20 minutes manually, found myself playing angry birds while sitting in those stupid highways not to get bored. No thank you. Game deinstalled. Used to be a long time X series fan but they really dropped the ball with this one.			"

												I own all of the X games. Rebirth was the most ""attractive one"" for me. New interface (let's face it, the old one was terrible -> keeping it complex doesn't mean that it should also be inaccessible), station interiors, a story line that will suck us in and so.Well, first of all, the cockpit design was good, at least as an idea. Being able to wander around in your ship is also good. As an idea.What Rebirth did wrong is that, all the ideas that would elevate the gameplay were implemented so bad that, they actually hurt the title.The interface causes more issues than fun. Yeah, every space sim fan loves to wander around in their ship, experiencing the roleplay of a space farer. However, when that cockpit causes you to loose your tradeships, fail your missions, limit you from using other angles to see your ship, etc. it becomes a burden. Come on, Privateer had multiple angles and camera views AND a cockpit view. A game that came out two decades ago!The story, it could've been interesting, even if being a total cliché. However, the voice acting KILLS the atmosphere. God, the voice acting is SO bad that, you will IMMEDIATELY want to turn the audio speech off. The dialogue scripts are also terrible. It is as if a kid wrote the whole script. You meet with the remnants of a long time enemy, in two sentences, you decide to help them fix their base. They are not surprised to see you, you are not surprised to see them etc.The interiors are all the same, with little to zero difference. The station dialogue stuff is basically trading menus while staring at an NPC, a very badly modeled one to be exact. The ""dialogue like"" menu is also completely useless. It looks like a pre-alpha stage Mass Effect dialogue tree used for a menu system.The co-pilot you get in game as a part of the story is also completely useless. Whenever you are occupied with something else, she just... well, she just ""exists"" that is all. No autopilot, no anything.The dialogues with other NPCs are also terrible.The only thing I liked about the game was the graphics. They weren't on today's high end standards and the game crashes or stalls more than a player can bear, but they were still good.However, gameplay elements of the game were poor at best in every sense and in every department that, it would be disrespectful to recommend this game as a part of a genre where you can find titles like Privateer, Freelancer (in all its flaws), IWar, DarkStar One (even that one is better) and worse, other X games. Heck, even playing back the very old classics like Elite would be much more fun, while you await for the upcoming Star Citizen and Elite 4 as a fan of the genre.I was really hopeful about this game, even pre-ordering it.Such a shame... So much potential down the drain.			"

												Updated to include 3.0 changes.Most reported bugs from the good old days are now corrected.  Game is 100% playable.  With 3.0 new content was added to include a new race, new ships, new sectors, new missions and new features.  After a very bumpy start Rebirth has pushed beyond what people were promised and have entered into something new and improved.  While some people still complain about lag and there are cases where lag does in fact take things down a notch for the most part people are getting beyond playable rates.  You will never get 120 fps but most of the people I talk to as well as myself are getting in the 40s.I'll not give away any story details because I hate when people do that but it's an interesting addition.  If you own the game there is no reason not to try it again.  If you don't own the game you can get an enjoyable experience as a good price so give it a try.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Updates up to and including Version 2.0 corrected the majority of the launch bugs and added a lot of requested features.  The game is fully playable and depending on what you are looking for can give you hours and hours of fun.Also with 2.10 (In Beta) there is a native 64bit executable which should address some of the resource issues.One thing to remember is that X games tend to take a while before they get to a state where people love them.X3 had a bad start and really didn't shine until version 2.5 yet now it's one of the greatest space sims out there.There is a lot of bad threads in the forums and Egosoft did earn a lot of hate from the poor release. however they have spent the last 6 months fixing things as fast as they can and adding requested items as fast as they can.  There is still work to be done and we hope that within a few months they will move from a bug fix mode to a new content mode.That being said, remember when reading reviews, a person's opinion really only matters if you are that person.  I like the game, I have since launch.  There are a lot of people that do not like that game.  A lot of that is related in the core gameplay.  It's different then X3 and a lot of people do not like that.If you are looking for a X3 clone with some new flashy graphics this isn't your game.You'll also note that alot of the reviews were done 6 months ago and do not reflect any patches or the 2.0 update.Updated on 5/29 to reflect 2.10 changes.  2.10(still in RC stage) introduces a native 64bit executable.

												At its present state, X:Rebirth will not provide an immersive space sim experience given some technical and design decisions that will require overhaul.The beauty of the space ""landscape"" is severely impaired by the non functional trade, economical and stability issues.Having been announced as a AAA game, and sold at nearly 50€ is by far one of (if not the most) most incomplete games I have ever played. It is still clearly in alpha stage, and for people hoping for a good space sim to come, one can only wish it gets better (immensely better) via patching, so that we can look at it as an ""okay"" game.from 0-10 I would give 3.5. I think it has the potential to go up to 6.5			"

												I can finally recommend this game. The Devs have done a lot of hard work to fix many things, and it shows. Many people I have spoken with believe the game has gone from a 1/10 to a 7/10 and counting. The great thing about egosoft is they don't release a game and then forget about it. They constantly add to it and update it over time. I feel like X-R at release was simply the release of a foundation/framework that was meant to be built upon over time, both by the devs and the modding community. This turned many people off because they expected a completed game with every single bell and whistle they desired. Those bells and whistles were not in at release, but they are here now.  Either by the devs or the great modding community.The devs have fixed almost every bug I've ever heard of/encountered. They have added very nice UI improvements and quality of life features.The mod authors have filled in the gaps with afew nice things, but I wouldn't be surprised if the devs added them to vanilla.All in all I am excited for the future of the game! I am actually having fun this time around.			"

												I wanted to like this game; I really did.  However, at the end of the day, and after a couple years of opportunity to fix and patch, while the game has improved, it still at its core is lacking.   I am disappointed about this, however it's still a game with some merit, and many people may find it enjoyable.  So while I'm tempted to give it a ""no"", I can't quite do that.

Any fan of the previous X games will be sorely disappointed with the dumbed-down yet confusing interface and drastically limited interaction options.

												(v4.0 w/ HoL and TO expansions)X3:TC and X3:AP set a high bar. X:R doesn't reach it, but is still a decent game. On its surface, it seems like a straightforward upgrade to the X3 games. The same core mechanics are there: you fly around in a universe with rich lore, trading, fighting, or exploring, whatever suits your fancy.Lots of people have gripes about mechanical issues of the game, like the highway system. That doesn't bother me. The universe is less dynamic than X3 (pirates don't really affect the economy, for example, they just constantly send small squadrons to die). In some ways, the mechanics improved: the addition of surface elements to capital ships is a really great addition to combat that makes small ships pack a huge punch if used effectively. But these minor issues aside, the real problem with X:R versus previous X games is lack of content. By content, I don't mean amount of space to explore: there's plenty of that. But there are relatively few types of ships and stations to buy, and you can only fly one ship, which is bad, although you can mostly get used to it. The amount of lore and numbers of factions is cut down significantly from previous games.By far the biggest problem is the relative lack of subquests or subplots. Once you've beat the campaign, the game is completely open-ended. Not open-ended like Skyrim, where the only problem is choosing which of the thousands of quests to do. Open-ended as in, there essentially ARE no other quests (except repetitive, randomly generated ones), and sure you can build stations or blow up stuff, but it all feels quite pointless. The pinnacle of X3 was quests like the Hub Plot and Player Station, which gave awesome rewards in return for huge amounts of financial engineering. In X:R, there are a few sub-quests that give you cool rewards, but they are all of the form ""find these items randomly hidden throughout the universe"". It would be enormously tedious if not impossible without internet guides, and with them it becomes trivial.So, in future expansions, it would be nice to add ships or factions. But what the game really needs to step things up a notch is things to DO in the X Universe. It's still worth $30 but not yet worthy of the X Series IMO.			"

												I have clocked in thousands of hours in the X series, all the way from X2 to X3AP. So believe me when I say I could not be more disappointed with how X-R came to be. 7 years in development, when in reality it was 7 years of Console development, a failed pitch to Microsoft, and a quick cash grab to recoup the costs of their monumentally dumbed down game.From design decisions based on programmer's personal beliefs (no automation, jump drives, SETA, mind numbingly boring minigames), to decisions that simply boggle the mind (no cancelling of trade orders, your ship carries no cargo, you personally have to drive around and order your ships to trade, literally nothing in the game is 2 button presses to issue an order)Sure, the space cities look damn pretty. From the outside. Because they had to be, because to even interract with one of these gorgeous space cities, you have to scour the entire external surface with a fine-toothed comb to even dock. And when you do, you'll wish you hadn't. X-R features the most hideous, badly rigged and designed character models I have literally ever seen. The models in X2, a game over 10 years old, looked better. Between that and the mandatory hunting of arbitrary pilots to pilot your ships *for* you (because you will never leave the Skunk for something better), the disgusting 'find the crates' minigame, and the heavily Consolized conversation wheels, you'd wished you stayed outside, and wonder how this ever because a feature.Next we have the Universe. Something that the X series is pretty well known for; it's huge, sprawling universe that you are but one speck of. Well good look seeing the universe, because the new map system is taken out of a preschoolers scribble book. Not that you would even need a map, because there are only 4 regions to explore. Admittedly, they are divided up into 5 sectors, dozens of zones and plenty more inbetween, but cmon. X3AP had 213 individual sectors, and there was more life in the empty sector of Maelstrom in X3 than there is in 90% of the zones in X-R. There simply is no life. Lots of show and distractions, but peek behind the curtain and you realize that all the NPC ships around you only exist when you're there. Ships in space highways literally do not exist outside of those highways. The flowing traffick that weaves through space cities? Completely arbitrary ships with 1hp that have no repercussions for you shooting 10,000 of them. I literally cannot recommend this game to anyone on the reasoning that Egosoft has patently *lied* about the kind of game Rebirth was going to be. ""Less complicated, but the same complexity. Complexity is good, complicated is bad"" keeps being one of the biggest phrases attributed to this game, but it simply is not true. The 'new and better, more intuitive' UI is literally light years behind the UI in X3, and that is seriously saying something.Please, do not buy this game. Give the money to a charity. It'll serve more good there.			"

												--This recommendation had to be trimmed to meet Steam's character limit.--http://steamcommunity.com/app/2870/discussions/0/648811852568427989/X Rebirth is a strange game.  In an effort to try to be more friendly to newer players and stem the complexity of commanding your fleets, they’ve pushed the menus towards an even more difficult mess.Instead of having a point-and-click interface, time was spent in generating a main menu that uses a radial design[...] The downside is that while the design works alright for the controller, it caused keyboard inputs to suffer. [...]Trading seems to be tuned for some interesting changes.  For “bulk orders” you don’t order a ship to a station, [...] you enter into buying and selling agreements with a station that you assign to a capital ship on your behalf. [...]The downside is that with this method, trading is slow and prone to failure, with what appears to be a fairly critical bug if the ship can’t complete the trade. In this case [...]your ship is stuck with these goods permanently. Hopefully we will see this resolved soon.[...]While on a station, you’re given the opportunity to take everything that isn’t nailed down. While the game seems to acknowledge the strange behavior in the form of the main character Ren Otani asking his companion “What’s wrong with you?” as a direct response to her suggestion that you steal everything, nobody else will seem to mind. [...]One interesting thing that I’d like to see explored further later on is the use of officers for capital ships. While you are limited to one ship, the Albion Skunk (complete with anthropomorphic suggestive hull paint and all), you can gather a fleet of capital ships and smaller ships. In order to have them operate correctly, you must hire a captain (for capital ships) along with support crew like a defense officer or engineer, or a pilot (for smaller ships) and assign them to their craft. This is a little tedious[...].  With that said, this gives a little bit of an RPG mechanic as the characters you are hiring have different skill levels that will ultimately affect the effectiveness of your fleets and also gives a little more personal approach to fleet management.Visually the game is stunning. Space tends to be extremely busy around stations and it doesn’t have a problem showing you that. Egosoft mentioned that each ship was supposed to be important, representing a functioning piece of the economy, but it seems that a smaller vessels around stations (that may represent civilian traffic) don’t really have a purpose as they just circle the stations endlessly. [...]The voice acting is pretty disappointing. While I’m not one to expect anything stellar from Egosoft seeing as how the studio is based in Germany, the stark difference between previous games and X Rebirth is there. It doesn’t help that they managed to get someone that sounds more variable in tone and a native English speaker to play Ren Otani, while your companion falls in line with what sounds like a script reading. Previous X-games were consistent in voice talent quality, X Rebirth isn’t which makes it worse. Repeating lines are a common problem too. While on station you will hear anyone and everyone mention at least five times that they are amazed that the inter-station highway, used for fast travel between sectors of space, wasn’t present 40 years ago. It doesn’t help that in some cases you’ll have a chance to talk up people you want to do business with that will also have Ren Otani spout off how it’s amazing the highways weren’t present 40 years ago as well.For all it’s faults and all it’s problems, X Rebirth has a decent game to play once it’s chiseled free from what is marring it. [...]While I am writing this recommendation, I only do so as a service to friends and readers. Buy the game if you’re wanting to get a look at it, just expect it to be a little rough until Egosoft has made it’s sweep on trying to clean it up. Otherwise hold off for a little until after.			"

												Ok, i read some reviews before buying this and they actually almost led me to not purchase this game.It is very different from any other part of the X-Universe series, not in story but substance. The whole story and freeplay are played from the bridge of the Albion Skunk (no way to change the name or ship) you can build a fleet and command them even visit your other ships but not fly them personally. For me this is and was a let down, Imiss being at the helm of my cap ship to get attacked and fly out in my fighter to intercaept with my wing to protect my goliath cap ship, but i was the pilot of that cap and the fighter my choice, and if i wanted to fly the cap again just land if i can (not anymore) you will be able to land at your cap not fly it.The space station interiors are very generic with only maybee 3-4 designs and that might be pushing it, and some of the trading is a little coveluted because you have to search for the person on the atation and they they still might not carry the item you want to sell or need,But that is part of exploring and that type of variation at those dealers does cause one to venture out more to find where you can move that item. However the station offer system is a pain as you will find youself having to micromanage these menus by flying back and forth between stations that carry what you are buying and selling so you can keep abreast of offers. If you can see past all the changes and approach this as a BRAND NEW game it's fun, its not very buggy, runs great, and has substance and plot however the story is shorter than most at about 60 or so hours.  I like it, its different and i had to warm up to it but i like it.Answer to weltall_of_id 1st commentsI understand your question, and no I am not sure why there is so much hate,there are some real gamechangers here in Rebirth and as i continue playing i will continue to revise this review. I hate the minigame for hacking and conversations its annoying as i cant exactly figure the thing out as i get changing results all thge time that dont seem to follow an exact pattern. as far as being able to fly a cap ship, i found it really neat do dock get out and watch it fly from the docking hanger while issuing orders like i used to, i found this trick when my hull was so damaged i needed somewhere to hide and had gotten my ships back, so actually commanding a capship has become MORE fun for me as i get really cool scenery going by ang get to watch a lot of the battles from the safety of inside the ships bay. This is really a new version of x universe and its hard to transition to from what the old games were like, i am getting the dlc today as its on sale and i can actually see me finishing this game and wanting more at this point.  I may not have such hard feelings because i started the series on x3 terran conflict, it was great but also had its flaws. This game is a different game set in the same recreated universe that is more beautiful than ever, the collision deaths have been eliminated ""my greatest frustration with the old game"" which is wonderful,and there are a lot of new things to do, Im not gonna say its a bad game, its really cool in its own right I think people need to do more of the Think part of the game and they will discover its as deep as any X UNIVERSE game and not just a shooter its a real strategy game now, maybee they just dont think enough they want easy answers.:steamhappy:Reply to #2 wow this review is going to get long and in depth I will try not to give spoilers: To all upset X-Universe players ALERT you have missed the boat with this game, remember being in your cap ship having to either screw with a camera to see a battle your ship was in with terrible AI or jump into a fighter well now you can have both at your fingertips if you use your noggin and have a great view of battles at the same time and even participate of course. Yeah ok you cant change ships per se' cry instead of think ( not adressed to 1st responder), wow.. I c'mon guys it's build fight think and trade all here, you really have to think though, and yes this game is REALLY FUN after patches though i must admit i need ao use the trade agents forever or another code for trading due to lack of sateltes, one huge drawback as i hate these types of cheats or any as a matter of fact, but im backed into a corner with trading otherwise, as far as the convo minigame it still pisses me off and i havent gotten a steady result from it, its a feature i avoid like the plague, but its my main complaint besides the trade system, but with one click of a button all is well and this game is really worth playing, just use that trade agents forever or revel things cheat and youll be set, ( wish you didnt have to maybee the minigame cheat would be better ) my NEXT playthrough yep im gonna play the story more than once I'll try that and maybee even when i get the hang of the new universe and where things are not even that. I am really enjoying this game sorry to evryone who is too stuck up to give it a fair shake its great in sooooooooo many ways and has its flaws too but really it's a four out of 5			"

												I bought this game on release and it was absolutely unplayable. The bugs were terrible. I decided to wait and see if they would clear up some of the problems given time. I'm sorry to say it's as laggy and buggy as ever. I've just put in one more hour of play and with that I've already come across a bug that made it unplayable. I got stuck on of all things the edge of a door. Well, I'll tell you that alone wouldn't make me put this game down again, but alas! my previos save (which I decided to do often just in case of a bug) is corrupt. Huzzah! My previous loads were all black screens. I could hear the clicking and walking in the background, but could not see. I give up. I say avoid at all costs!			"

												With the 4.0 release I have finally been drawn back to the game and can enjoy it.So far in more than 200 hours of v4.0 I have had one CTD after some furious key pressing.  I've had two lock ups due to Alt Tabbing issues with other software running.Graphically I now have the game running in Ultra on my MSI7950 GPU and framerates are rarely slower than acceptable.  The new weaponry of TO and HOL DLC's has made the fighting more enjoyable and once you train up your marines capping is fun again too.As I took more than a year off from playing the game for more than a feww minutes I am lookking at the game from a fresh perspective.  Anyone new to Xgames should enjoy the  game.  Old fans of X3 such as myself can enjoy it if they treat try the game on its own merits. "

												Very disappointing for an X game.  We were told that we'd get to walk around in ships and stations, but this did not happen.  We get to walk around in a tiny fenced-off area of those ships and stations.  Those vast beautiful structures you see from the outside?  Nope, you get to walk around in a tiny section that takes about a minute to explore fully.  The station interiors themselves are copy-pasted and completely uninspiring.  The NPCs might as well be vending machines for all the immersion they add.  The graphics you get in these walking around sections are low res awfulness with crap shaders that might have been considered adequate ten years ago - a stark contrast to the lovely visuals you get while flying your spaceship.  The voice acting is also worth mentioning as being terrible, but I think that's always going to be a feature of X games.As for the things I liked... well, as I said before, the visuals while flying around are pretty good, but I'm not convinced they're any better than the graphics in Terran Conflict or Albion Prelude.  Overall, if this had been a £10 game from an indy developer, I might have enjoyed this game.  But being a £40 game from an established developer with some seriously good games under its belt... I expected better.  Not recommended.			"

												Although crested with the great name of the X Series . This game is a different approach to the Space genre in which the original X Series takes place. Similar to ELITE or other sandbox type Space games.One word in advance:Do not exspect anything like the X Series you know abide the familiar Universe it takes place in.Also it is frankly said very much dumbed down in terms of depth compared to X3 Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude. The player can only directly control his ship which can be upgraded with various things such as weapons,shields, engines,drones, etc. Most of these upgrades lack completely in variety though. Compared to X3 this is nothing but a arcady version of the amount of gear and weaponry that a player could aquire for a vast array of ship types which he could all fly himself or let the Ai control.Having been in the pipeline for about 7 years (and that is a peculiar amount of time which does not reflect either in content or polish of the released product) X Rebirth was released late November 2013 and was greatly anticipated by the fan base and new players alike. It was quite a success commerically at start unlike the X games before.But the policy of the Developer Egosoft and the Publisher Deepsilver not to send out playtesting promos to the Press and the concealment tactics of the Lead Developer on presentation in the media and on gamescom lead the trail of lemmings right to the slaughter. Released in the EU for a hefty price point of 50€ which is far more exspensive than other similar productions of that proportion and in other markets like the US for only 30$ the price policy alone must give us thought, given the fact that the major fan base of X was always European sounds like cash cow milking and promoing the new markets with a lower price point. Well if a developer thinks his game is worth 50€ then he better deliver on spot....no?What the customer got on release day was nothing but a bloating mess of desastrous bugs, crashes, plot stoppers. Despite the old and dated directx 9.x based engine and the very strongly indicated signs of a failed XBOX360 development in the codebase the game looks very good but suffered and still suffers on various framerate issues an slowdowns on even the most powerful systems.Some work has already been done on that with early patches..but still the game is released in a state of not being playable at all.  All crtiic sites reflect that opinion.Nevertheless it hurts to see the game series come to this point of cataclysm...because the problem with X Rebirth is....you WANT to play it....you WANT it to be good ...and it keeps making you come back to it every now and then to check if things have improved. A lot of people might not have the patience.My verdict after 50 hours not being able to complete the plot or enjoyably play a game in Free Mode due to bugs: Do not pay full price for unfinished business. Wait at least 3 months and grab when deals are available and the most painful bugs have been hopefully ironed out.My word to the developer... Repent and change your paradigm of how you interact with your fansand how you release a product. Next time we want to see you go OPEN about it not in closedoff forums hidden away with a group of elite community people. No this needs EARLY ACCESSand lots of input to be a better product next time.			"

												Decided to try it out since it was on winter sale and because the reviews seem better in the 4.0 patch as well as the Home of Light DLC.  I played quite a bit of X2, X3, X3:TC, X3:AP and found that the prior games are pretty fun.  After almost 10 hours in this game -- I enjoyed really only the first hour (as just initialy learning how to fly and checking out the world was fun).   I kept playing after that first hour hoping that as I got further into the campaign that the game would get better.  But unfortunately the opposite was true, and it just kept getting worse.The campaign missions started getting glitchy and didn't make much sense.  For example, you need to use AI ships to trade by giving them orders, but sometimes they will sit with an order in their queue but just not do anything.   After cancelling the orders and setting them again they might do what you asked them to do.  Campaign missions targets became silly, like deliver ""X"" of some item to a station.  Except, you can buy that item from that station, and then turn around and sell it right back to complete the mission.   Mission targets aren't explained ""how"" to accomplish something.  So if you don't already know how to play the game you will need to check online forums and what not to figure out how to do whatever the game asks you to do.Overall the gamplay is really clunky, full of needless time-wasting, and very difficult to figure out how to do anything.   It seems like they wanted to streamline the gameplay to make it more accessible, but really they just made it more frustrating to play.  The previous games were pretty good, but this one just isn't worth it except for maybe the die-hard fans.  So even with the 4.0 patch, and the home of light DLC, I would not recommend a purchase if you are on the fence -- even if it's on sale.   It's too bad because the engine itself, the graphics, etc seem pretty good.			"

												As someone who purchased this game at launch and uninstalled after a few hours of frustration, I felt the need to write my very first Steam review years later, after giving X: Rebirth a second chance. I want to encourage those who found this game as maddeningly buggy and unfinished as I did at launch to consider the immense improvements that have come with patches and DLCs, and to give this ground breaking game a second chance. Yes, despite the age of X: Rebirth, I still consider it to be modern and groundbreaking. The level of freedom and immersion achievable in this game is absolutely unparalleled by similar genre titles. It's strong ambition, however, is also it's greatest failing. The tools provided to the player to build their empire of trade and conquest are exhaustive, but unintuitive. So much so that after 60+ hours I am still learning to navigate the endless menus of information about the economy and struggling to fully comprehend the station supply techniques that allow for self sustaining empire building. I have at my fingertips the ability to see hundreds of trade offers, complete with supply and demand based pricing, but to earn that right I must search out and play a tediously simple mini-game at each and every station I desire to track trade offers from. Likewise, while I have the freedom to issue specific and complex orders to individual crew members of my various combat ships and fleets, the only ship I can directly pilot is my own, which is limited in its combat role. Thus, I find myself in awe of what complexity X: Rebirth permits while I am simultaneously confused about certain design choices that seem to hinder the sense of player freedom that the game strives to instill. The campaign serves more as a lengthy tutorial to the game's many features than as a draw for those most interested in story and lore. I found myself very engaged from beginning to end, as the player is unintentionally caught up in conflict and forced to take sides while  they explore the X universe for new allies and trade opportunities. The ending is unquestionably rushed, however, and is an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise well told narrative. The voice acting, it should be noted, is far from triple-A quality, but while the lines were not always delivered in the most effective way, it never cripples the narrative beyond recovery. Many of my issues with game mechanics were easily solved with a quick trip to the Steam Workshop. The modding community for this game is small, but among the highest quality and most dedicated that I have seen. The complexity and scope of many of the available mods really turn this game from a B- into a A-. X: Rebirth does not require mods to make it a tremendous experience, but a minor tweak to the interface here and a slight additional convenience there can really give the player a much more fluid expierence. Add to that a more expansive mod or two, and X: Rebirth can easily surpass even the highest of expectations for a space sim. In summation:Pros-immersive and enormous universe to explore-very high level of player freedom to achieve almost anything -engaging story arc-stellar modding community -graphically gorgeousCons-unintuitive UI, requiring a lot of time and Google searches to truly grasp-disappointing design choices that hinder the feeling of freedom (such as inability to fly other ships or take over enemy sectors without mods) -abrupt plot conclusion leaves player feeling unfulfilled Despite its flaws, I strongly recommend this title for fans of the genre who are willing to invest the time required to comprehend the vastness and complexity that is X: Rebirth.

												As a player who can barely get into the other X games, I was kinda worried about getting this game on release day. 1 year and a half later, this game goes on sale for 15$ and they even offered a free weekend period for the skeptics. I decided to jump in, and I was extremely pleased with what I found:-The most immersive space game I have played, second only to Freelancer ( I miss you Freelancer :'I )-Actual effort in the soundtrack!!!! (God, I can listen to this all day)- U.I. that is more friendly than past X games. - Hiring and assigning employees is easier than ever.- The economic system has depth thanks to the different aspects of base building- The ships and stations are all eye candy, adding to the rewards of exploration.- Combat, while not as creative as Starpoint Gemini, is still satisfying and epic!Sidenote: The fact that you can control only one ship might ♥♥♥♥ off a few people, but I find that it contributes to the personal side of the experience.Other than framerate issues, I haven't experienced many negatives in this game (yet). I will update this review accordingly.EDIT:-Ram leak, which forces me to restart the game every 2-3 hours (not too bad, but I have 8 gb, I can't imagine those with 4)-Having fleets is quite awesome, but capital ships seem to collide with each other WAY too often. I personally fixed this by making  2 capital ships follow another, and that other follows me.-Be careful what mods you put, it might prevent the trigger of important story events.			"

												That's what I always wanted my space sim not to be like: Flying from sector to sector, scanning generic space stations, landing on cookie cutter ports to walk through awfully designed, boring interiors talking to even more generic NPCs that always offer the same shallow lines of utterly ridiculous dialogue. Thank god a game crash ended my first and probably only foray into this soulless mess of a game. Yes, after 5 hours I have probably not seen much of the game, but it is enough to get a first impression and that first impression is that this game is generic, boring and a waste of time and money.

												Ok ... I have never written a review about a game before but being a long time X fan since X3 Reunion and loving Egosoft for always supporting thier games forever ... not for money but to do the right thing for thier product and customers, I feel that the overall review score on Steam is now an unfair one.  When this game came out I was so disappointed and it was almost unplayable.  Over two years later this is the game I expected on release.Seriously everyone completely forget the reviews from 6+ months ago or so.  This is a different game.  This is a playable game. This is a very emersive fun to play game that has the unique X universe feel.  You can really do what you want in the universe Egosoft created.  Be a pirate, mercenary, trader on a micro scale doing everything yourself or simply sit back and coordinate your fleets, fighting or trading, and let the game be more of a macro sim.  Even better ... mix the two!!The character models are not the best and walking on stations and interacting with NPC's isn't as emersive as something like Mass Effect, but the space sim feel is deep and emersive.  If you like open world type games like GTA and you like space, then give this a try.  If you are an old X fan who was burnt when this was released or if you never have picked up an X game, after this 4.0 update now is the time to do it. I have the Teladi DLC and I will be buying the Home of Light DLC too. This game will give you many hours of fun and has high replayability as well.  There are some high learning curves if you have never played an X game before, but it is very much worth it. TL;DR.  Forget the past two years of comments and reviews, this is a new game, one that should have been released in this form. Open world (universe) space sim unlike any other I have played. Egosoft the best developer who doesn't chase profitttsss but supports thier product and customers for years after release. Fight, Build, Trade, Think and start your empire today (or your anti-empire path of destruction) ! :D			"

GraphicsOne word: amazing. I love the colors, the design, the mood and the fancy stations with millions of little details. Space feels alive and vibrant; you dive through a highway full of little spaceships, ascend alongside of a giant station and see the local authorities chase some criminals and watch a huge destroyer explode in the distance. It's space simulation at it's prettiest. But the character models are ... whoever has a fetish for old women in tight sapce suits - there you go. Remember Aida from Unreal 2 from 2001? She looks way better and softer than Yisha.SoundSound effects are suitable. Not much to say here; it's your standard beep and bleep. But the speech output is an insult. Who thought it would be a good idea to drag the receptionist of a Pizza Service in front of a microphone and let her read off the lines? It sounds dull, without passion and I classify this in the same category as voiceovers of pornography in the late 70s.MusicI wish I only had bought the Soundtrack without the game. Really, I do. The soundtrack is amazing. I listen to it even when I'm doing something else than gaming. Thanks for that, Egosoft. ControlsStandard. Nothing to say about that, except the absolute mess they did with the navigation through the menus. I can't even ... how did they ♥♥♥♥ up a simple thing like menu navigation?GameplayI won't say anything about this, but invite you to imagine the following: ""We've got a massive universe, lore and tons of weapons, systems, software, stuff, things ... just things, enemies, factions ... what about throwing 70 % of that over board and put what's left of it into the new game?""Personal opinionI had hopes. I had expectations. I had a ticket reserved on the hype train, front row. And the train crashed. Into an orphanage. On Christmas Eve.			"

												Unfortunately I just cannot get into this game despite the updates & despite my upgraded hardware, capable now of running everything smoothly on max settings. Nearly all interactions and game mechanics are presented in a clunky way. The simple act of selling goods is wonky. There is no sell all button. The buy/sell screens are very weird and poorly planned. It's like the developers never played other modern games and discovered better/standardized UI features that save time and improve fun.Everything is so unclear and seems designed to be difficult to learn. The Albion skunk cockpit takes up 60% of the screen so you're constantly having to look around just to get a glimpse of the system you're in. I tried many times to get into this game after loving X3 but I just couldn't.Fundamentally this game needs a serious overhaul in the UI and accessibility departments. Strange how they tried to make X:R more accessible to a larger audience but those attempts in themselves only oversimplified everything to the point of extreme annoyance to X3 fans and the confusion of newcomers.

												I played this game version 4.0 and now I recommend it. I have about 10 stations and 20 ships and it feels like my own empire - which is what I like about this game. Exploration initally was enjoyable, later it becomes a ""management"" game.You do not need to walk around stations much if you do not want to. Most tasks can be completed by calling remotely.There are anoying parts of the game which you can take care of with these mods:-show skills-capital ship bridge 4.0+-TAF! - trade price updates forever (no need to go back and check prices)-Super Scanner-Shut Up Ren-Faster Ships (faster capital ships)-Fly-by Infoscan-Fly-by looting-Fly-by LockboxIf you want autotrader: -YAT.If you want cheats: Simoon's Lantern			"

												I've been a fan of Egosoft since X-Beyond-The-Frontier, and I own all of their games...  I was playing their games before steam was even a conceptual thought, and have logged god only knows how many countless hours into the entire trilogy, whichincludes XBTF, X-Gold, X2: The Threat, X3 Reunion, X3 Terran Conflict, X3 Albion Prelude, and all those games were awesome, the best in my opinion is a fair tie between Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude.  I liked Prelude because of the stock market, that didn't exist in previous releases....then came X-Rebirth... an entirely different story... we waited a long time for it's release thinking they were putting a lot of heart and effort into the game, to make it as good if not better than the previous sequels, then when it was finally released as a FULL release mind you, and not the Beta release now displayed along with it's title, it was a complete mess, with nothing working.  We all paid full release prices for a game that wasn't even worth calling an ""Alpha"", and to this day, the patches are released far from what we would have otherwise wished for on the scale of progress in giving gamers what they paid for.I suppose this is a game that Egosoft was hoping the modding community would bail them out, and for some just may have, but for the hard core gamers, and the gamers-4-life, such as myself, being 43 years old, and a gamer all my life on PC platforms, I can say I won't touch this game anymore, until Bernd stops stuffing coke up his nose, and gives us paying customers what we paid for.My verdict: YOu don't always get what you paid for, especially now days, sometimes you get ripped off.  Don't buy this game, and if you do plan on buying it, at least watch others play the game, and keep an eye out for the problems that people are finding with the game... Don't just look at what works, because it's the game breaking things they aren't telling you, thats gong to affect your overall enjoyment of this game! So now I'm playing Space Engineers, an early release game, that receives an update every thursday, and a fixer patch for that update on fridays, it's a promising title by Keen Software, creator of Miner Wars, a game I haven't played, but I'm willing to give them a chance, because I really want Space Engineers to make it to Game Of The Year once they've completed it, but that part depends on them, and how much they listen to their customers, and the amount of effort they put into fixing the existing game crashes.  I'm going to give them the same chance I gave Egosoft, and hopefully we won't get ripped off as Egosoft has done. "

												Of the 41 hours I've played this game I've had mixed emotions.X Rebirth is really wanting to be a good space sim, but is lacking many things, and seems either low budget, or lazy on the developer's side. I love that I can build an empire basically of multiple types of stations, small fighters, Capital ships, Miners, and Trade ships, but I never really had anything to do with my ""Empire"" after it was all said and done. Being able to take sectors for your own government you made (And that you're in charge of) would have been great. Sadly you are only able to make more and more money, for no reason it seems, from what I found.Your character can never fly a different ship, which was a feature they took out from their previous games. What kind of Space sim only allows the use of one ship? And the character models look awful by the way.Space sims are about choice, and even though you can sort of destroy other factions stations, you can't get rid of them, and this just seems like a trade simulator... Not a Space sim.			"

												In the current state of the game, do NOT buy this game. By mission 3 there is a game-breaking BUG that literally forces you to use your AI companions (freighter ship) to finish a mission. Sadly, the ability to control your AI is not there. Utterly forcing you to play in sandbox mode, to be ultimately lost on what to do in the game, or never play the game at all.			"

												This game is horrid.....First all, I'm a fan...err...was a fan of egosofts since imperium....I don't even know where to start when trying to describe the badness of this game....Here we go, I'll grade it on X amount of things1: Story...    It is bad....you are dumped into the story not knowing who you character is, and you WILL NEVER find out....you'll know more about your copilot..the god awful Yisha, then yourself....Yisha is horrid but I'll get into her later....As the story progresses you WILL hit a wall, this game does not like deviations from the current missions, doing so bugs it, or breaks it....careful following the quest marker blindly as it can bug you or lead you off to a place no where near your mission thus. Full of plot holes..one after the other...I describe it as egosoft randomly picked employees to write different chapters, the employees didn't talk to eachother and then they just pasted the sotry together...BAM, Xrebirth story...the ending to the campaign is the worst ending I've seen to a game...the most unepic boring thing you'll do that leaves you feeling lost when you finish the game...The story is linear, like i said, deviate and you'll just screw yourself....Devries has very little resources and no stations providing an AOE ware bonus so they consume them quickly....if you get there to slow, you will HAVE to hack your save to get the plot going again....2: Artificial Intelligence....     It doesn't exist in this game....Anything you encounter you can destroy WITHOUT upgrading your ship....no skill needed...if the combat AI needs to attack something it'll to a beeline straight for it...3 shots and it'll die and it won't do any dmg to you in the process...90% of the time, AI will ignore you until you attack it..after that it'll target you, but usually you'll blow it up in 1 second so it won't matter...(I'll talk about trade AI later in the trade part)...Larger cap ships are also the dumbest ships you'll encounter...even in numbers, just get behind them, destroy the engines and the ship is basically a sitting duck...just strafe shoot kill hide behind it, let shields recharge, rinse repeat, launch boarders and the ship is yours...some ships have weapons defending their engines but they are few in numbers and you can easily dispatch them...this is how you make money in the game...nothing else will come close to the amount of money you can make by capturing succs for 18million and selling them every 15 minutes....cha-chang...If you do play, you'll encounter bundles of ships just sitting there waiting for you to kill them....awesome....Escort ships take routes into buildings and then get stuck, I've watched 4 police ships hump eachother on the side of a station cause they couldn't figure out that they could go UP...Seen cap ships just fly thru everything, but this is intentional as if they didn't they would never get to their intended targets when you call for them as any ship in the sector can't figure out basic navigation....what do you mean I can't just fly thru this building..why not....3: trade: IS BROKEN AND FAKE    I don't care what the fanboys say, the economy is not dynamic...you see ships flying in the sector but they don't trade, ships don't go from sector to sector...it's an illusion...I believe it's an area of effect kind of thing...if your station makes this item that the stations around it could use then it supplies them just by being around it....I've explored every aspect of trying to figure out how the trade system could be dynamic and everything in the game says it isn't..except egosoft....they also say every ship has a purpose but they don't..only ships that have a purpose are yours, everything else is just there to make it look like they are doing stuff but they are not....Now when you start trading you'll encounter the horrid trading AI...it takes the most god awful routes to things...my advice..leave the sector, something changes when you leave a sector. I was watching these trades for hours just waiting because you hit a brick wall in the plot and you have to trade to build...well, after hours of watching this ship just circle around, I left to do a mission, Bam, done as soon as i got a few sectors away...wtf...so I did it from a distance with the trade software...BAM...almost an instant trade...well, this should  be a clue to how the engine of the game runs in the background.....ships aren't moving around in the background....Graphics:Space graphics are great....flying around...awesome....but this can get boring really quickly....Now, NPCs like Yisha...holy hell did they screw the pooch here....they are awful...whoever thought this was a good idea should not be in computer programming or have an artistic job....They all have this joint at the base of their skull so when they turn their necks it's like the exorcist....they all look old and fake, seen better NPC graphics in games that were from 2001...The dialogue in this game should just be erased...especially yishas...it sounds like they just grabbed people from off the street to record dialogue...nothing makes sense and they are all somewhat hostile or way too friendly...and get ready to hear the same stuff over..and over...and over...and over...sometimes in rapid succesion...missions where you kill something in a sector..kill 10 ships really quickly, and you will...you'll hear the same thanks, station probably blah blah blah, guess you want money..blah blah....Every dock seems to have a bar..but I guess its a strip club without the strippers...probably for the best..if I saw one of those Npc's in a thong I'd barf...Yisha has the largest camel toe, the station pictures all scream sex sex sex...but nope..none...least yisha could give you some road head on those highway adventures...more on highways later....hate this game...Minigames....   YEAH!!! minigames, everyones favorite right...well, what they did here was turn minigames into nightmares....need loot..awesome, turn on the ping thing and go out to space and repeat the same process over and over looting lockers...yes, lockers...millions floating out in space full of junk that you can sell for 100 credits...oh boy, loot a million of them and maybe you will be able to afford your first upgrade....there are also lockers and boxes all over stations and vents...cant forget vents...again, full of junk, steal it all, no one cares....The highway..i spent more time in these highways staring at the butt of a ship then actually fighting....Someone at egosoft was sitting in traffic one day and decided that this would make an excellent minigame....fire that guy....if it was bernd, go find another company to work for as bernd no longer holds the interest of ANYbody.....more mini games include some dialogue Bs but your responses don't match anything and you won't know what to do....I can't express how much I hate this game...it is horrid, don't buy it, buy another game...Review is 1/10....the 1 is for graphics (in space only) the rest is garbage....PS..if you think the mods will fix this....they have already abandon ship as egosoft made this game unfriendly to modders....PSS..if your waiting for patches....egosoft will be gone soon, they ♥♥♥♥ed up badly and will have to declare bankruptcy soonPSSS ..dont buy this game....PSSSS ..EGOSOFTS MODs IN ACTION....http://illidiantx.tumblr.com/ "

												At this point I have put a good 60+ hours into the game without the DLC. I originally stayed away from X: Rebirth because of reviews about bugs, lack of content, and overall dislike of how it differed from other X games.I can honestly say that all of that was not apparent through my experience thus far. This game is beautiful, intelligent, and with the addition of a few mods...extremely enjoyable. Definitely recommended for any fan of space games.			"

												It doesn't matter how many times I try to get into this game, it never works properly for more than an hour before *something* breaks it. Either something I do in game, something that happens outside of my control in game that makes everything stop functioning, a random CTD, a graphical glitch or some game-breaking situation. Considering I played X3TC until I conquered half of the map and had more fleets and production facilities than I could count this game is a MAJOR diappointment. It lacks any sense of progress, and after waiting for it with glee and anticipation, paying £50 for the version that had the soundtrack (the collector editions had sold out) I really feel ripped off. In fact I've never before felt quite so ripped off and shocked as I was with this. Half of the mods people make and release for it are functions that anyone woul d have expected to already be in the game. Nothing about this game even feels like an X game should feel. I appreciate that it was supposed to be a revamp, but to me a revamp should not mean taking the top ten most amazing things from X3, deleting them and replacing them with week-old fish-paste; and that's basically all this is. Do not buy, even if you really really badly want another X game (we all did).			"

												Having played X2, Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude, I was very excited about X Rebirth. But, not too surprisingly, I decided to wait for a couple of big patches after the desastrous release. 2,5 years later and version number 4.0, I finally jumped into the game. A lot of things have changed and some of them were not for the better. Only a single ship, indirect trading and kinda limited order and fleet options of other ships, the weird weapon mechanics of the player ship, some things really seems not thought through.However, many things still work pretty good. I prefer the new station building over the old one, to be honest, even though trading just feels less important. Capital ships now have hardpoints that can be destroyed. Hiring crew for specific tasks is kinda cool, too.I think I still prefer Albion Prelude over Rebirth. However, ultimately I felt entertained enough to be able to recommend this installment. I just hope that Egosoft will listen to people's opinions about Rebirth for the next game and improve the weak points.			"

												Since Update 1.25 alot has been fixed, performance, trading simulations, station building, AI interaction, and the AI's ability to defend itself when engaging in a Capital warfare fight, your capital ships starting to blast everything out of the sky that attacks you, even set the defence officer to engage anything hostile within the area you pass through, its a LOVELY! yes lovely sight to see a taranis start shooting drones out of the sky and hear the capital pilot your engaging scream for helpive had a break from the game since update 1.23, and when i say alot has been fixed, it has.extremly low crash rate, if a ship gets stuck on station, easy fix, command it to stop its action fly away from the area and return after its followed you to your area command it to fly you back, and make an reorder, very simple fix now ive not had to reboot the game, not even once since update 1.25.to all people who had trouble befor give the game a try now.the game is a wonderfull place for huge space battles!, stations vs a flok of 20 taranis's? Sure! you might loose a couple of them but hell its a good fight to watch and join in with!			"

												     Well, I'm a fan of the X3 games. I like the whole empire building, trading, exploring etc concept. I also tend to like more complex, steep learning curve games; this qualifies as that.      Is this an X4 for those who have played X3, NO. Is it based in the same universe that and X3 gamer would recognize, YES. Can you change from a trading ship to a scout to a heavy fighter then to a capital ship, NO. Can you build huge complexes that are self sufficient and make you tons of money , NO. Can you set up universal traders to make money, NO.      Something else that is different from X3 is the use of highways to move around. Previously in X3 to speed up movement one would engage SETA (basically a fast forward button). The issue with SETA is that it hogs up ram and on a 32 bit program you have a limited amount of ram to work with. The use of highways can get you from place to place without SETA and FPS going into the single digits. Rebirth is 64 bit (now) and this is not so much of an issue, but the highways are still there.     Space stations can still be built, but they are now built in stages and cannot be connected to one another to create a complex. The price of building a station has gone up quite a bit as well.     Trading is changed as well, since you cannot fly a freighter yourself, you must delegate trading to individual freighters.   Say you want to trade energy cells, you need a freighter capable of hauling energy cells and you then bring up the trade menu to see who is selling energy cells the cheapest, and likewise who is buying them for the best profit. You tell the freighter where to go, but this is all unseen it's kind of boring.     Capturing ships is still possible as well. Fighters can be captured should you make the original pilot bail, but you need to have your own pilot onboard your ship to be able to do so. Capturing larger is easier then in X3. Now you can cripple a ship's engines and weapons prior to launching your 50 marines (how do they fit in a corvette sized ship?).     So, bottom line, if you like complex trade empire building games and can get over the differences from X3 then you will have fun with this game.			"

												Let me preface by saying X Rebirth is quite possibly the most amazing-looking space game of all time. My complaints run the gamut, but graphics are not among them.* X Rebirth's developers built on a massive scale appropriate for space -- this isn't a space sim where the universe feels small, or where stations are half-hearted efforts to give players a place to dock their ships. The stations in X Rebirth are glorious affairs, with Blade Runner-esque lights and signs, intricate manufacturing modules where you can see machinery sculpting products from raw materials, nooks and crannies to hide your ship from hostile forces, and often jaw-dropping detail -- when you do a slow fly-by around space farming stations, for instance, you can see every leaf of the vegetation growing beneath massive domes, and machines strafing those spacegardens with water jets. Likewise, the devs clearly paid attention to planetary scale. When you're in orbit around a planet, the planet should be almost incomprehensibly massive. It should dominate your field of view. And in this game it does, providing an amazing backdrop for pitched battles and ambushes. The designers also did a fantastic job of increasing visual immersion with the way the Albion Skunk's cockpit is rendered -- the ambient light in the cockpit changes with the light source from outside. That means if you're headed toward a station close to a star, your cockpit is bathed in vivid yellows. If you're in deep space, the cockpit's hues are subdued.Still, I can't recommend X Rebirth. Lots of people have reported problems with framerate, even on high-end systems. This has been acknowledged by the developer. Personally I have not had that problem, but the problem is, it's nearly impossible to tell if the game will run appropriately until you install it on your own machine. Secondly, there is merit to the complaints about inscrutable menu systems and unnecessarily complex in-game tasks. Getting your fleet's ships to dock, refuel, and take on cargo can be a nightmare, and the difficulty is apparently arbitrary. Sometimes it works flawlessly, sometimes you're waiting an hour until you fly in to inspect the problem yourself and see that, for some reason, drones are not off-loading cargo.Likewise, there's a difference between hand-holding and obscuring features beneath menu layers that make it difficult for players to get their bearings, nevermind figure out how certain tasks are accomplished. This is a game that can't be played without an open web browser to help get through frustratingly, needlessly complicated tasks. You'll also need the web browser for figuring out how to progress, because the game doesn't always make it clear if you're prepared for certain zones or missions. Conclusion: Save your money. If X Rebirth plunges to $4.99 or $9.99 in some future Summer Sale or flash sale, it's worth picking up just for the joy of exploring the game's systems and starbases. And maybe, after the better part of two years, the game will be smoothed out by then. We'll have to wait and see.* Caveat to praising the graphics: The space station interiors are pretty awful. All of them are nearly identical in decor and visual style, if not layout. It makes little sense that a civilization cut off from the rest of humanity would build stations exactly like everyone else, but there you have it. And the NPC models are so poorly done, it might have been better if the devs dropped the idea of interiors altogether. "

I feel allot of time has been spent fixing the Bugs and anything extra you would want can be added with a Click of the mouse Mod. The developers have come a long way from the X series and I am proud to own this title and see all the support this game has had. ships, guns, ammo, station building is great, fun to build your station in one system and starve the rest of the stations in that system. it is breathtaking game and the expansion is worth the time and effort. some people think that they are game critics when each game is tailored to different generations of people.   Buy the game! get something to drink, relax and get into it. its slow to start out but picks up very fast. enjoy just cruising the systems.good luck have fun !  huge X title fan.			"

												First impression 5 hours in is pretty horrible. Knowing myself I'll keep going until I've seen everything the game has to offer even if I regret spending those hours later, so I'll update this review if it gets better. I've played all previous X games from X2 on BTW, but I'll try to have an open-minded approach to this one.PROS- Decent graphics in space, some pretty impressive sights- Basic control with gamepad is good- Fully modeled cockpit with a copilot is pretty cool, let's see if it gets old- Shooting feels good- Capital ships with destructible subsystems- Some gameplay elements like boarding ships feel a bit less tacked on than in X3- No sudoku puzzle through text entry (so far)CONS- Game flashes brief and vague messages about features and commands at the worst possible moments. There's no way you're gonna learn how to play the game that way. It also sometimes fails to adjust to context, i.e. you can stop autopilot by hitting the ""brake/reverse"" button on the gamepad, but the game never tells you! It prefers to tell you to press Shift-A.--> As bad as No Man's Sky is, it does a good job of introducing the game's commands, with repetitive and contextual prompts. Check it out devs.- With so many commands the gamepad command binding would need support for long presses, dual presses, and so on. X3:AP had commands that worked like that if my memory is good.- Yawn-inducing story that doesn't mesh well with gameplay at all. It temporarily takes away a ship without warning, puts most opportunities for business in hostile zones... X2 had the common sense of giving you the occasional breathing room in a relatively safe environment to experiment with the game.- You spend most of your time listening to the highway music, your view obscured by the highway walls. Missions so far involve a lot of boring travelling this way. (Contrast that with earlier X games where you traversed amazing looking sectors with great music.)- Space stations are all nearly exactly the same inside, there's basically one interior model.- Travelling involves holding down the left trigger all the time if you want to move forward. Ok in a racing game maybe, not in a space game where you spend most of your time monotonously moving forward. (You can work around that by using keyboard commands.)- You must hunt tiny icons for docking points, material selling points, station scanning, and so forth. It's really hard to associate those icons with what they're supposed to be floating above (especially the ""info"" icons) and they get obscured by other objects.- Everything looks aliased as hell from a distance even with 8x anti-aliasing, with a distinct ""crawling"" effect on distant objects as you move around.- What the hell is this map. It's completely unintuitive compared to X3, is useless for exploring, useless to get an overview of services offered in an area, and clicking anything zooms and pans you in unhelpful ways. Highways are not named or numbered and show where they're going unless you've let the game plot a course for you.- Lack of soul. No news of what's going on around the universe, no description for each sector like in previous X games (occasional video when entering some areas). All you get is descriptions for wares and (apparently) an underlying economic simulation.Lastly something in a recent interview with the lead designer that really stuck with me: he says he avoids playing games with similar elements to this one to avoid being influenced by them. Well play them you idiot! This way you might learn about best practices instead of (badly) reinventing the wheel.Oh yeah, he also keeps complaining about how it's hard to keep their core X3 audience happy, as if that's the reason for X Rebirth's failure. I've never been a fan of X2/X3's late gameplay of watching your bank account increase by itself, and I'm still not impressed with this game. Sorry guys, maybe you just made a bad game irrelevant of audience.			"

												I had such high hopes for this game when I bought my pre-order. What we got was a game that is buggier than a rotten tree-stump that was UNPLAYABLE !!! Almost NOTHING worked !This game was not even in the 'Alpha' stage of development when it was released to scam everyone out of their money for a broken, undeveloped game and Steam/Valve's stubborn policy of refusing to refund people's money, for what is obviously a defective product, is nothing less than shameful.If you don't believe me, go over and see the Egosoft forums and look over the community forums here at Steam.Currently, they are on Patch 1.18 and I've taken a break from even attempting to play up to yet ANOTHER game-breaking bug, only to have to wait for another patch that will fix some problems , yet create new ones, as has happened with every patch so far and everyone is having awful framerate issues regardless of how powerful and current their PC hardware is.Maybe in a year or so, this game MIGHT...be capable of being played through from start to finish, as it's supposed to but that time is not now or the near future and for what it's worth, EVERY fan of the X Series that has at least been playing since X3 Albion Prelude, say's that this game is a pathetic parody of it's former self and in no way equal to the gameplay and storyline quality of it's predecessors.Buyer beware !I give this game a 3/10 rating and only give it the 3 because of the nice graphics in outerspace, even though the quality of the inside of the stations and NPC's is a campy joke at best.

												PROS:-long-termed enjoyement-deep economy, station building and management-massive capital ships combat-very immersive, very personal: you  feel like the pilot of your ship, sitting in your cockpit. Turning flight assist OFF is fun and a bit more realistic.-loads of playstyles, like TRADER/MANAGER, BUILDER, MERCENARY, MINER but also SMUGGLER, PIRATE or CORSAIR... Or mix of all.-very fluid gameplay - there are no loading screens, everything feels very fluid and natural, especially ship movement and menu navigation-UI is quite easy to use (for me at least)CONS:-when you assign a ship under station, it will automatically bring needed wares - there is no way of telling the ship which exact resource it should bring (they sometimes bring stuff that is not really needed - or needed stuff is ignored, and other resources are brought)-there is no way of forcing your managers to use your own budget (watching manager budgets can be annoying if you have many stations, especially in private stations)-some people don't like to be limited to one ship (but then again, this is one of the main features of the game, it's something that was never promised, we knew that there's one playership for two years before the game was even released, so this is truly meaningless)-some people might expect more upgrades for playership-performance could have been better			"

												Short Review:One of the most astonishingly beautiful pieces of crap you'll ever see.Long Review:I really wanted to like this game, I loved all the other games in the series and played the hell out of them, in spite of their massive learning curve they were extremely enjoyable because learning to play them felt like discovering how to play them.Rebirth is a glorious looking game based on a flawed development plan. Were they making a game where you control lots of ships or just one ship? What was the point of walking around on a station, was this supposed to be like a shooter or something? Everyone looks the same and trades different wares, but all this serves to do is make the simple act of buying and selling enormously tedious. The previous games had a relatively simple interface for trading, managing your ships, and viewing the map, these things are all convoluted and cluttered in a series of menus which aren't really explained.Beyond that, there's really not a lot of fun. The main quest for example has you build a URV forge at one point but the build process requires materials you can only buy from a hostile faction. Okay so go pirate and steal what you need, right? Well not exactly, in my game Fusion Reactors just weren't being traded anywhere, I guess if I let the game run non-stop over a period of several days the economy might right itself, but I ended up just altering my save file to get on with things. What ended up happening is the URV forge completed but required me to provide a mining ship. I go to purchase a mining ship which must be built first, so I build my mining ship and nothing happens because, again, it's missing some resource to finish building it.If you fell asleep during the description of gameplay in that last paragraph I wouldn't blame you, the quests are just that boring, I wanted to love this game but it finally occurred to me that I wasn't having any fun playing it. It's a beautiful game no doubt, but honestly if they just took the previous X games and slapped these graphics on them that would have been great, it would have been released sooner, with fewer bugs and higher reviews. You're given very little instruction about how to play the game and you'll find yourself spending more time in Google looking things up than you will blowing up badguys. As far as the combat goes, well you have the option to auto-aim at everything which makes it boring OR you can turn off the auto aim and try to manually aim but the weapons don't track very smoothly and you'll find the simple act of killing an enemy a frustrating endeavor. Adding to this, some ships like corvettes don't even have a lead indicator but maneuver like fighters. There are some great mods out there, the capital ship bridge mod for example is so wonderful that you have to wonder why it wasn't included with the game, but overall I've noticed that modders tend to abandon their work due to frustration with the limitations of the game engine, This can lead to corrupted save games and having to start over but more often having to make do without mods you had come to enjoy. I really wanted to see a better end-game played out, the possibility to conquer whole sectors of space and wage huge intergalactic wars, I wanted to see a smoother interface and tighter fleet management, the ability to control my wings of fighters and carrier groups against large scale invasions, the ability to lead a squad of commandos in an exciting, if rudimentary, boarding action on an enemy starbase or capital ship. Maybe those things exist somewhere to some degree at some point in X Rebirth, but I don't have the stomach for all the endless tedium one must endure to reach that point.			"

												So X Rebirth was poorly received by just about everyone when released.  As someone who has thousands of hours in X3TC I held back.  There were some updates and the game went on sale so I tried it.  It was terrible.Here I am couple years later, hearing that the game and expansions have improved this once terrible game.Guess what, it hasn't.  If I didn't have as many hours in it as I do (really trying to give it a chance and lets be honest, I spent most of my in game time trying to get the controls right or just flying a little bit which was wated time) I would ask for a refund.I don't normally rant or get really angry like many people on the internet, I find myself always trying to be calm, reasonable, and logical.  Holy ♥♥♥♥ I hate this god damn mutherfracking game.  It is terrible. Controls - TerribleStory - Terrible (buggy as hell still)Voice Acting - Terrible (seriously I think monkeys playing bongos would be a step up)Gameplay - terrible (besides the bugs for the main story mission I can't even do the main missions without dying even though I'm following their tutorial? I have thosands of hours in X3TC I'm no noob)Ships - Terrible (this companies great plan to remove the thing that made previous games great, still stuck with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ single ship, even with mods for capital ships, which you gain and lose in the first few hours of the main story, it still blows giant donkey nuts)This might be the worst game I've ever purchased.  I keep wanting to give it a chance because of X3TC being so god damn beautiful, but each time I try I feel like I opened a portal into the abyss and let the void suck the life and enjoyment out of me.There isn't even any decent imformation about the game from within explaining things or on websites (guess no one else cares to share because no one plays it).Seriously, if you are thinking of buying this game, don't.  If you think, it can't be that bad, it is.  Save yourself the money and stay the ♥♥♥♥ away from this.  I regret purchasing this in every way.			"

												Quite playbale and fun at the 4.0 level with the expansions. A few quirks/bugs with trading, but nothing that can't be worked around. If you're not into station building and building up an empire slowly, look elsewhere. This is about watching your third station come to life and finally start providing goods to your first two stations, reducing your costs as you begin building your fourth station, for which you'll need to go hijack a freighter with a boarding party. This isn't fast paced (mostly) and it takes dozens of hours to get into the meat of the experience- well after the campaign ends, if you play it. Still, at this point it's worth the cost and is a fun game. If I had this as a kid my brain would have exploded. Goes to show you what expectations change into after 30 years.			"

												As a veteran of the X series I learned to build armadas in X2, rinsed the XTM mod for x3 and after blitzing Terran conflict amassed the best part of 2800 hours in Albion Prelude. Safe to say I love the series and all the freedom it brings. As you could probably have guessed I pre-ordered X rebirth and as a result was one of the many that were shocked at how Egosoft could even dream that the game was a finished product. I persevered but after about 10 hours of pain I resumed Albion prelude and tried to pretend Rebirth never happened.That was 2 years ago...I recently returned to X rebirth to see what 2 years of bug fixing looked like. Credit were its due as the game is much improved. Yes there are still bugs and no it's not the same as the games that preceded it but I have to say it works. The immersive feeling of adventuring, exploring and conquering a vast and beautiful universe is there. The size and complexity of the ai stations is incredible and the changes made to the way sectors work is enjoyable (I kind of like the way the transport system works).Now I've yet to progress that far (and from what I know of the X series in guessing I have a lot left to discover) but the foundations of the gameplay are there for me and not simply a repetition of the previous games.Overall yes there's still more to fix but as is, the game is very enjoyable and hugely immersive.

I'd love to see if the mechanics have improved to the point of playability, but with so many rendering bugs and crashes it's tough to persevere.

												I held off buying this for years because of the very poor launch. But it's great now. I've sunk plenty of hours into it and I'm anxious to jump back in right now.It's not quite like the other games in the X series: you only get the one ship, which I guess disappointed some people. I don't think it makes too much difference. I suppose in general there's less customization. It's sort of simplified X. And the small-talk mini-game is kind of irritating, but still cute.It's got all the right elements: lots of obscure management features, an economic simulation, other captains you can control for trade and combat, plot missions to keep you busy, procedural missions to make some cash. And of course, lots of space combat around giant stations. And there's some new stuff in there too: you get more NPC interaction, you get to hire crew members, and there's even a little bit of training for them.Grab a walk-through for the campaign (there's a couple good ones in the Steam community) because a lot of the features and early plot missions are pretty confusing.

												I've been playing Elite Dangerous since first release, I love space games, and I saw this game here.There where a lot of negative reviews, but I decided to ignore them because a lot of fixes has been done since then.Also I bought this game since it supports Linux (which is my main OS). The game itself is impressive, the universe feels alive, and you do not feel alone at all.The campaign is great for learning the different mechanics in the game. Also the fact that you dock with stations, walk around and talk with people is great.This is something I really missed while playing Elite, in Elite you feel alone all though thousands of people play it.This game is a breath of fresh air, great gameplay, good graphics (even on low-end hardward like mine), and it works GREAT on linux.So, if you want a good space\strategy type game, then this is definately a game to get.

												Biggest waste of money and space to date. This game is so buggy that the company releasing this steaming pile of #hit should be sued or at least never allowed to make another game. The testers were either wilfully negligent in their duty to test this game or they just never tested it.1) The graphics in space while beautiful stops there. The rest of the game is UGLY!! The character models are among the ugliest I have ever seen given it's budget and development size. The space stations lack any imagination whatsoever and are so limited in what to do and see that despite the size of each space station, you will ever only visit one tiny room on said stations.2) Frame rate is atrocious. My gaming laptop can play games far better then this graphically at max with no problems. This game however is not optimised for any computer let alone high end one's.3) The UI is pointless, ugly and cluttered.4) While I am sure the developers thought it was cool, they were the only ones - The Hypergate jump mini game. 5) Game breaking bugs galore!!! Want to go somewhere crucial to your story? Yeah GTFO!! You will end up where the game wants you to. Want to talk to someone, GTFO!! Not happening. 6) Being given one ship the entire game is a complete fail. Especially when said ship is hopeless.This game is so utterly $hit, I won't even dignify it with a proper review but suffice to say, If I could get my money back on this game, I would. I preordered this game based on the studio's past track record. That was my mistake. Give this game a miss. Hell even if they give it to you for free, Do not waste your time.			"

												Absolutely grows on you. I never played any X games before and I started playing Rebirth with the most recent patch. It's surprisingly deep with a very interesting real-time economy and astonishingly beautiful places to visit. The UI is a bit cumbersome, but the campaign teaches its ins and outs at a user friendly pace.I understand that X3 had more depth and that Rebirth was unplayable when it launched, but what's actually here is incredible for newcomers like me. Because it feels so very different to anything I've ever played before. Still rough in many places, Rebirth is also immersive, original, surprising. Very indie. Very off-Broadway. Full of soul.  + flying feels great+ art design+ music+ world building+ space is brimming with life+ economy (build huge, interconnected stations in space)= shooting = textures= UI= bugs (still a lot, nothing too annoying though. think skyrim)= space station interieurs (copy/paste)= start of the campaign was a bit slow (1st hour or so)= AI (trade routes and economy stuff seems to work flawlessly, but enemy ships sometimes can't properly maneuver through space stations)- npc models (early 2000s)- voice sample (not enough of them) "

												You know what? I love this game. I've had it for a few months, but let the reviews colour my judgement. Just started it this week. I'm completely sucked in.For every industrialist and trader in Eve that ever wanted a solo game, this is it. Spreadsheets in space for one. Every bit as complex as you want to make it. Now, it's still a galactic economy of one so that's a downside. Modelling a realistic economy would be difficult to say the least. Yeah, it takes a bit to figure out. Thank you Mylo-S for your youtube.com videos. His very first video...BE PATIENT!I found out I was completely useless using a mouse and it really frustrated me. As soon as I moved over to the joystick, I could actually fly and fight and win.I _like_ the menus. It's a vast improvement over the previous X versions. The graphics are superb, the music is about what I'd normally think of or expect of music in a game. No default auto trading? <shakes head> There's a mod for that. (albeit with restrictions being universal type cargo carriers only, Bulk Fuel Liquid Container Energy)I couldn't really get into X2. I'm going to try X3x again, but really, Rebirth is what I wanted.Now, next game, let me fly all of my own boats, please. And put the darned auto trading back in. No bloody way am I going to micro-manage a fleet. "

												With 4.0, it is now much better than 2 years ago. Dare I say that it's pretty good. It's worth to try it regardless of whether you are a die-hard X fan or new to the X universe. One thing to keep in mind though - it's an X game, but from a different perspective. If in original X games, it took you forever to get your first M2, and you could easily fly it and decimate everything in your path, then this game is geared more towards encounters in your M6 equivalent (Albion Pride/Skunk) or humongous fleet battles, where Xenon (Rogue AI machines) can take down half your fleet.There are still some problems here and there. Most annoying things that i've encountered in 4.0 are:1) Trades for your cap ships take forever for some reason. Was much better in 3.612) Capital ships now bump into asteroids when boosting, instead of flying through them. This might have seemed like a good idea at first, but the execution in sectors with alot of particles, begs for flight AI to be altered(flight path must be around asteroids, go off-ecliptic!).3) Capital rebalancing - with introduction of Olmekron and Fulmekron destroyers, Taranis seems like a toy, while costing the same. Egosoft, please, add 2 more Plasma/Jet turrets on each side. It has spots for that afterall. Do It! And while you're at it, swap Astrobee launchers for V Crushers like on Arawn.4) More Capital rebalancing - fix Teladi cap ships! All of them!			"

Egosoft always has had very buggy launches but they come through with long-term support and it shows. Version 1 of X:R was just.....bad.

												Whatever you do, do NOT be sold by the gorgeous screenshots (and they ARE gorgeous).  I was, and then had to battle for a refund when I found out what a horrible, unplayable game X Rebirth is.  Instead, read every single industry critic review there is (they are all of one voice: ""terrible"") and if you really, really cannot resist after that, whatever you do, buy it from a source where you WILL get a refund (because there is every chance you'll want one).This isn't about bugs.  Bugs can be fixed (and will be).  It's about the fact that huge parts of the game are missing so you cannot complete the campaign (it was never finished), it's about the awful copy-and-paste single station interior (same set of 1990s-rendered rooms have been used for every space station - the furniture and the people are in identical locations in every one), there is the awful GUI that makes no sense (every option in a radial menu where the child options don't bear releation to parent options) and finally the fact that it's all eye-candy (those other ships do nothing and everything has been added for appearances sake).   Horrible design decisions, awful GUI from a suspected failed X-Box port and a game that is rushed and very incomplete.  Avoid.			"

												Well, what can i say? Its a great game... a great story but a sucky product... what do i mean? Bugs, burgs everywhere... just enter this great world of ships, construction vessels, capital ships at war and much more and look at it while it crumbles in pieces, sooo many pieces... i can assure you, the idea is great but the developers sucks.And, i´m pretty sure that egosoft selected to use xml format on the saves files so u can do all the fixes u need while playing... just with a text editor.... So, to sum it all up.... great game, great idea, sucks and falls apart b´cos of all the bugs and, u can edit all around the game, don´t wait for egosoft to fix the game 100%, this will be forever and ever a work in progress.

												NMS devs could learn a lot from these devs. the game launch was ♥♥♥♥ poor with a multitude of AI bugs and performance issues galore. in the 3 years now since it has been released, the quality has definitely achieved it's price comparison. the devs worked hard and it shows that they love their product and are dedicated to the full success of it in their eyes. it's no X4, but it has the ingenuity of X games all over it. try it out if you've enjoyed other X games or are intruiged by the concept!on a side note: im not sure about the dlc, i havent tried them, but i definitely recommend the base game even at $30/USD if you enjoy space trading sims/exploring space/space combat			"

												Despite to rather rocky start, X Rebirth 2.0 and greater have fixed many of the issues that made the game unplayable. It is still not as diverse and vast as its predecessors in the X series but I have found the game enjoyable enough to play almost 500 hours in little over a year. Starting with the graphics, they are satisfactory. Much of the gameplay will take place in the Albion Skunk's cockpit which allows you to look out at the beautiful galaxies and stunning spaceships which the X Series have never seemed to fail in impressing us. Then there is the staion/ship deck veiw... Although walking around in the many ships and station is really cool and the interiors are as great as the galaxies you get to admire, the people are somewhat unimpressive statues that come with one of three different faces. Although getting to walk amongst a station/ship's crew and interact face to face with a trader, the whole experience is lessened by the fact that the people look like they were taken straight from a 2004 pc game and just pasted into a 2013 one. Overall the exteriors/interiors, shadows and lighting are enough to make you overlook the fact that the NPC's are just so awful looking, however I still have a lot of fate that Egosoft will pull through and revamp the npc's appearance.The campaign storyline is awesome! Fighting alongside the renements of  rebel forces against a massive power hungry corporation always scores big points in my book. Without giving too much away, I would like to just say that storyline introduces you to some fascinating characters (That still look terrible!) that only thicken the plot and further immerse you into the storyline. My favourite part is that you are no longer alone in  the vastness of space, you now have a copilot/partner?/Friend to enjoy space with. Though she is very similar to the other female npcs in terms of appearance (can be fixed using certain mods), she is actually quite comical in the campaign and actually a real good addition to the normally lonely universe we've grown use to in previous X games.The ships and Stations you encounter and can buy/build will not disappoint you but I know one thing that will! You can't fly them...Any of them, you can dock and tell the captain to take you somewhere but thats as close to flying a capital ship as you will get. I do not mind such, personally I believe it is more realistic in not being able to pilot a capital ship. especially now that you get to hire members of your crew yourself. But I too have spent many hours flying my Thor in X Prelude and blasting Xenon to bits, its just so fun.The music is okay, it isn't quite up to par with that which we listened to in X3 series but its still not bad, except for the bar music though. I hate the bar music (Did I forget you can visit a Bar while docked in a station?) The voice acting is okay as well though there is a lot of repeatitive dialogue amost NPCs but the small talk mini-game is fun to play when you really want something at a station.The game as a whole has come a long way since its release, many features have been added (I've left out a lot, I might add them to my reveiw at a later date) and many of the bugs that resulted in crashing have been fixed. I have only had my game crash once since 2.0 and it may have been my fault as I was running a lot of other programs in the background. Despite the poor game rating and hundreds of negative reveiws this game has recieved during its intial release, it has become a VERY enjoyable game to play. There are still many things left to fix but given the amount of work that has been put into fixing and patching the game, my hopes are high.To anyone looking to buy this game, it is well worth it at this point. There are many mods out there right now that fix many of the issues many people have ingame and some added new features or galaxies which helps keep the gameinteresting while the developers continue to patch and add features themselves. I recommend buy the Teladi Outpost DLC with the gam though, it adds several more ships and fractions that only add to the game as a whole.			"

												Initially very disappointed in this release, but after watching a few video's explaining how to get started, it's quickly growing on me and I'm seeing the depth and inspiration that has gone into it.  Most difficult and annoying aspect is still navigation in terms of maps as well as navigating lists showing what I own.  This greatly hinders the initial ability of a player to easily dive into the game and get a sense of things and probably one of the big reasons it's not more popular.   It's difficult to quickly determine where your assets are or issue orders to them because the navigation is so heirachael and each level is so simple.  I would like to see the addition of the old style lists with perhaps some very good filters allowing you to quickly see what you have and where it's at and what it's status is.  Need that 50 foot view of what I have, and not wanting to have to drill down over and over to see basics.  One would think this is basic smart U.I. design.Another good example of this would be trying to find a decent captain or engineer for one of your ships.  You are forced to repeatedly drill down and ask them to show you their skills, which is redundant clicking and annoying.  These cases need a nice neat list you can look through so you're not wasting your time.  This is the difference between a well designed menu system and one that was slapped together with a lack of forethought about how real users play the game.  Other than the navigation usability issues, and the cartoonish colors used in some systems, the game does seem to be very cool and I'm getting a lot out of exploring and learning what's out there.  It has a lot of character.			"

												X: Rebirth was meant to reboot the franchise in order for it to appeal to a greater amount of players.  Egosoft meant to accomplish this by removing, fixing or adding features and streamlining them to be more accessible.  Egosoft's promises, however, proved void.The 'X' series have always been beloved because it is virtually the only franchise that offers a complete sandbox experience in a singleplayer environment.  A massive universe with a plethora of ships to fly and opportunities to pursue made the 'X' series a behemoth in space sandboxing.  However, all this sandboxing always came with a price - a clunky, inaccessible game with a learn curve akin to a 90 degree angled wall sunked in grease and other lubricants, unfortunately doing away with most people giving the franchise a try.  Again Egosoft promised it would tackle these problems.Hence, considering their past 15 years of experience, Egosoft was trusted that it could release the biggest, best and most accessible 'X' game to date.  Unfortunately, they couldn't have been more wrong.In it's current state, Rebirth is an unplayable mess.  Severe lack of optimisation, horrendous UI, atrocious character models, abysmal story, game breaking bugs, feature incomplete, frequent crashes and whatnot.  If anything Rebirth is the epitome od unfinished products released to meet publisher enforced deadlines.  It's amazing (give or take) seven years Egosoft brought a very promising and well-established franchise to its knees and even more amazing is how little they achieved with Rebirth.  Not one design goal that was mentioned in their first announcement has been completed.  Trading is utterly broken and even corrupts save game files, controlling AI ships has never been more tedious - regardless of what game we're looking at - horrendous performance on high-end systems show little to no interest in the PC market.If you have a midrange computer at your disposal most of the performance issues will not apply to you, however.While Egosoft has done everything it can to continously patch the game and we have seen a barrage of patches come our way, this game is not worth a purchase at all.  Unfortunate as it might be and as pretty as the screenshots may be, the game is an utter and complete mess.  For those coming back as veterans of the series, Rebirth has nothing to offer but instead is a step down from the sandbox that is X2/X3.  For those coming to take a peek at the 'X' series, Rebirth could have been an excellent starting point to ease into the series, if it didn't come with so many bugs, glitches and crashes.  If anything Rebirth is not your harbour if you are coming back or if you are just starting which is unfortunate, because when and if Rebirth works it's an absolutely gorgeous game (in space) and has a lot going for it.  It's a step up from games such as Freelancer in both offering a sandbox and complete experience.  It just turned out the be not the game Egosoft or its fans were hoping it'd be.			"

												I just recently bought this game before 4.o went live. When it came out I didn't have a strong enough computer to run it. My PC still has issues with it now but its playable. And, of course, the game was void of features plus it was a train wreck.I would like to thank the team at EGOsoft for making this game into what it is today. Yes its a bit different from X3: Albion Prelude in many ways (some that game does better some I like better here) but what X Rebirth is today I can honestly say I flippin adore.I love you guys at EGOSoft. I love your products so much and this one has not let me down! 5/5===It does bother me we are not able to manually dock at stations anymore and that 'carrier' class ships cannot house fighters :( Other then that you guys are doing a GREAT JOB!

												Apart from the name, this game has nothing to do with the X series. One thing I haven't seen in other reviews is that you are limited to using one weapon at a time - at least I coouldn't find a way to fire multiple guns at the same time. The other thing is that the menus are not as 'snappy' as they were in say X3. Once you knew the keyboard shortcuts in previous X games you could get to any function pretty fast. In this game after quickly pressing 'Enter -> 5 -> 5' it only recognizes the first '5' keypress and I have to wait for the game to finish rendering the new radial menu before I can press the second '5'. Makes for a lot more sluggish interface.The rest of the problems (trading, highways, station interiors, etc.) have been already detailed in other reviews so I won't duplicate those.			"

												X:Rebirth is a fascinating mess.  I did not play the game at release or anything near to it, so my review is in regards to the game circa early 2015.  X:Rebirth is a many-headed hydra, where each head does not fit well with the others.  Presumably to reduce the reliance on menu's seen in previous X games, X:Rebirth features a 'walking in stations' system.  At no point does anything you do while walking in stations add anything other than a terribly looking character to your game experience.  As soon as you figure out how to do the same thing via menus, you will.  It is faster and more aesthetically pleasing.The core of the game is an economic empire simulator with the player as a trader CEO who for some reason also engages in combat and exploration.  All of this is accomplished from one ship that has a paltry number of upgrades that only require vast wealth to acquire.  The control of underlings is accomplished through a terribly poorly designed ui that requires repetition of multiple clickthroughs to achieve even the most simple of tasks.  Reassign a fighter from one wing to another? Requires comms to the pilot, choose how to assign them, pick their new superior, and then you are actually forced to wait while their confirmation dialogue plays.  All this could be accomplished through a single drag-drop, but not in X:Rebirth.The space part of the game looks great even without mods, but most of your time is necessarily spent flying around stations.  Although the stations have a wonderful diversity compared to say Elite:Dangerous, no one really wants to spend hours and hours flying around them.  Yet you must in order to discover trade opportunities, missions, and the discounts that make trade profitable.  Even with a fair amount of modding to reduce the tedium of things like scouting stations, I still found myself bored and frustrated by ~70% of the campaign.  I also ran into a game breaking bug that apparently others have not experienced involving a full stop in campaign progress due to a missing NPC.  I had kept hoping that at some point the tedious exploration, lackluster combat (I think 90% of my missiles missed no matter the type I used) and poorly voice acted story would evolve into a fun trade empire simulation, but, for me, it never happened.Even at a reduced sale price, it is hard to justify the purchase of X:Rebirth unless you give Egosoft a lot of credit for aspirations rather than accomplishments.

												I've had a long relationship with this game.  I played it when it launched, and hated it.  I played it around v2.5, and was frustrated with it.  But finally, at v4.0, the game is...  Competent.So, how can I put this?  X Rebirth in its 4.0 state is like a roughly-cut imperfect diamond; it's got a lot of facets but none of them shine as brightly as they could.  All of the aspects of the game do come together to create a compelling experience, but its not without some slight frustration and disappointment.The game prides itself upon the facets of TRADE, FIGHT, BUILD, THINK, so let's break it down that way.TRADE is much more involved versus prior X games, keeping the player engaged with their trade ships, a change I rather like.  You have to find trade offers and send orders to your ships to execute the trades through a manual process.  This is made easier through the acquisition of Trade Agents, who will keep you up to date on current prices on individual stations.  The game provides a handy interface for quickly finding and executing those exceptional deals, once your catalog of stations is large enough.Despite all the updates, the interface is still your greatest enemy when trading.  The game is asking you to get your hands-dirty with micro-management while providing you an interface that just barely makes it possible.  Wares are given top-billing with stations being sorted by wares, and while this is what you want 90% of the time, there is that 10% where you might want to see wares sorted by station.  This is not a possible way to search, however.Other small aggrevations, like the routes traders may decide to take, like through unexplored sectors with angry cap-ships blowing up anything that moves, means that you'll encounter frustration from time-to-time as a trader.FIGHT has also been improved.  Rare is the time I see ships attacking space stations by rubbing their nose cone against its hull!  (It still happens though...  Shameful...)  Dog-fighting is an identical experience no matter what faction or ship you're engaged in.  All AI ships fly out a ways, come screaming in guns a-blazing (almost always out-of-formation), usually collide with you, and then go flying off to repeat it, cork-screwing if you happen to be shooting at them.  Even the tankier ships with terrible maneuverability, like the Xenon P, will do this despite being ill-suited to it.Almost all capital ships are completely defenseless versus a meticulously-controlled Skunk.  Your little ship, once upgraded, can execute surgical attacks, hanging out in blind spots and picking off systems, breaking the legs of even the largest, most fearsome ships.  Many cap-ships provide perfect little hiding spots for you to even recharge your shields hidden away from enemy fighters (looking at you Xenon I, the most ""fearsome"" ship in the game).  It just seems kind of weird that capital ships have no defense against this.  At least make it so the Skunk's shields can't recharge while in an enemy cap-ship's area of influence!  Come on!Finally, fleet-actions are left entirely to the AI, which we've already seen, is pretty dumb.  You can hang out on the deck of one of your cap-ships while it blows things up.  You can tell it what to focus attention on but cannot take direct control or even provide strategic guidance, RTS-style.  Just kick back and hope your ship's AI doesn't do anything completely asinine.Suffice it to say, combat feels like one of the shallower aspects that X Rebirth offers.  Smarter, ship-class-based combat AI would go a long ways toward bringing this up to par.BUILD, on the other hand, is one of the game's stronger offerings.  Station construction and management is straight-forward, the offerings of stations are diverse, and a lot of leeway is given to the order that construction will occur.  You can prioritize getting one ware producing before another.  Stations are being handled better than they ever have been in previous X games.There is very little to complain about when it comes to building stations and your influence on the economy.  The campaign tutorialization left out some important information (that the list of stations that can be built is based on the faction that built the constructor ship; screw you DeVries!) and I wish station traders could leave the system to obtain resources, but these are pretty small complaints.  X Rebirth did pretty allright here!THINK is a little vague, in concept, but I'll assume it's about integration: pulling all the other facets together to advance in the game.  This is where the compelling experience I talked about comes through.  The games gives so many tools to exploit in so many ways, one play-through can be entirely unlike another.In building your trade empire, you may want to obtain a small military to protect your ships in contested areas.Maybe you want to train the toughest marines and sac cap-ships to resell for massive profits.Be a cut-throat and pirate the cargo of one faction to sell it to another!Literally, you can do ALL these things as the opportunities merit, and many more things I haven't even mentioned yet, like hacking space stations!  This is where the true meat of the game comes from and why you will spend dozens of hours in this game.  It's just that you will often find yourself wishing for small changes to make the overall experience even better.  You'll wish that last fight was a little more challenging, or that the trading was a little more streamlined, or that the small-talk mini-game would just go off and die already.The small-talk minigame is honestly the worst part of this game.  Let's just end on that.			"

												This is a review of version 4.0.I am not an old vet of the X series. I discovered this franchise with X3.  Immediately after launching X3, I was hooked by his universe, gameplay , possibilities .... everything to be honest. So when X rebirth got released, I bought it immediately and faced ... a huge disappointment. I simply could not stand the game, after trying for 10 hours, I just gave up.Time passed, several updates were released and I launched the game again for The Teladi Outpost update.  I thought at this time '' we are on the right path but we are not there yet '', so I quit the game and waited.4.0 is released, and I said okay now is the time, I am going to give X rebirth , one last chance.So after 22 hours played on 4.0, I can finally say it '' We are there finaly !!!!'' After more than 2 years and the product is finally finished and enjoyable.Egosoft took their time but they fixed all big issues, they listen to the community and adapt their game.It is still very different from X3 but it s an amazing Space Sim, probably one of the best with Elite: Dangerous, in my opinion.My advise :-If you own the game :  install and try it again.- if you don't own the game but like Space Sim :  Try the Free demo, I am sure you will like it.- If you don't like Space Sim : I really don't know why you read this review.See you pilots and enjoy .

												This is Mount and Blade in space.  If you're sick of empty ""sand box"" games like Far Cry, Fallout 4 or Elite Dangerous (so glad I bought this and not Elite Dangerous,) this is your game.  You are one tiny ship in a giant galaxy of space stations, capital ships, freighters and stellar phenomenon.  You can be a pirate, smuggler, trader, police officer, bounty hunter or eventually, shipping magnate and fleet commander.  As is the case in a real sand box game, you're thrown into a well-thought out, functional world and you do whatever you feel like.  Apparently the game sucked when it came out (all that's fixed) and franchise loyalists don't like some of the decisions the developers made.  I didn't play it three years ago and I've never even heard of the franchise before; as someone with no previous bias towards this game I HIGHLY suggest it.  Oh and the dogfighting is a blast.  The world they've created is so awesome, I almost forgot to mention how great the combat is.Conclusion: Forget Elite Dangerous; this is the sand box space sim where stuff actually happens.			"

												""What promised to be a great successor to the series, turn out to be a mess. This is no surprise given Egosoft’s penchant for releasing messes and then tidying them up after the fact. But the problem with X Rebirth is that it’s a different kind of mess than the previous games, in new and terribly wrong ways that are beyond tidying up. X Rebirth doesn’t seem to understand what people liked about the previous games. It is a game based on misguided assumptions."" - Quarter to Three.I think is the best description to the current state of the game.

Also while it shows I have 21 hours under my belt with this game that is not the case and I only played it for about 6 hours. If you have not bought this game yet I would suggest you keep the money in your pocket as the game is still a mess and has no depth of game play either.

												I bought the game later on so it was already patched (3.61). No bugs so far and it's great: there's a single player campaign with an actual plot and characters and plenty of side missions. You can hack into stations, actually walk around them and talk to NPCs, pirate ships, commerce, build stations... Also, the actual flying model of the ship is fun, so indulging in some dogfights is all but boring.Moreover, the devs are constantly supporting and expanding the game.Definitely recommended if you like space sims.

												Initially I preordered this game and when it came out I was hugely disapointed by it. I've not touched it since except for today when I looked at some of the videos posted of the game. Having reinstalled and played it again I can see a massive improvement in many areas. This game is now holding my attention and I want to play it.Just to make it clear this is not an X3 sequel, its only slightly similar in some aspects. I still crave for a proper ""X4"" type game which this certainly isn't.The game is far from what I hoped it would be but with some mods installed the game is improved beyond its original state at launch. For example there is a simple mod which removes the cockpit so you get a decent view of the space in front of you.I recommend to anyone thinking of trying it to watch videos on Youtube etc. It helps to understand some of the basics as this game is still not right without some configuration but its now perfectly possible to change some of the most irritating parts making the game much more enjoyable.If you are a X series fan then its probably one to avoid because you can't help but make unfavourable comparisons. If however you're able to conceptually separate this game from the X series then its not too bad. I guess in the end I bought it expecting something else but over the years I've come to terms with the fact that this game is never going to be what I thought it should be.I still hope one day for a proper X3 sequel...

												While the game was absolutely terrible and broken when it got released a long time ago, Egosoft did a really good job of improving the game in many aspects, improving the interface and adding completely new features to the game. I also enjoy the DLCs quite alot (only one is shown in the shop so far, but another one is coming, which is even more worth purchasing).To be frank, the campaign story is kind of meh, especially the last mission, but the story was (except for the very first X-title X-Beyond the frontier) never a focus point of the games.As a fan since the beginning of the series, i hated the new highway system in the beginning because i thought making the warp gates more rare and instead focussing on highways was a betrayal to the series, especially since i did not care about the Albion sectors in the X3-series. But after a while i must say that i love the new highway system, its a great way to enjoy the scenery and to take a short break while flying from sector to sector.It also has great mod support, a really nice mod community and a really great community overall.And i must emphasize, unlike many developers who have a bad/broken launch and just abandon the game, Egosoft is known for supporting and improving the game even years after it's initizal release, and while almost every title in the X-series was incredibly broken at launch (hence the many bad reviews) Egosoft always did their best to improve the game to make their games great, even if it takes many years of (usually) free updates and patches.The only huge gripe i have with this game is it's over-complicated and over-complex menu/sub-menu system to do simple things. But after a while you get used to it.Unpatched on release it was garbage, over time it became acceptable, now i think it's a nice addition to the X-series and i'm always eagerly waiting for Egosoft to put in new updates.Is it perfect? By all means no. Is it enjoyable? In my opinion yes (why else would i play it over 500 hours?), as long as you don't have problems with fiddling around with menus.			"

												At the VERY start of the release of the game it was horrible -1/10 like (I know that is impossible but that is how I saw it).  However after Egosoft got off their asses and fixed some, not all, of the problems it actually became playable, now I would give it a 6/10 now.  Don't get me wrong the game still needs A LOT of work, but now it is actually fun to play.			"

												I have owned this game from its initial release which anyone who picked it up back then knows it wasn't as expected and was a very embarrassing release for Egosoft. Having now played this for over 300 hours I feel this is a good time to leave a fair review. As mentioned the game was unplayable on its release and got slammed but credit to the devs as there have been a ton of patches, hot fiixes and updates. Also a DLC in the form of the Teladi Outpost, with a further one planned Feb 16 - Home of light. It's because of this support to the community that I would say this as a good game, it has plenty to do, a beautiful universe to explore, campaign mode and free play modes also structured start modes such as pirate, trader. Etc.. There are a ton of mods available from the very clever people in the community which make it even more playable. If anyone held back based on early reviews of the game I would say give a go it's very playable now, unfortunately the early reviews of this game still give it such a bad name on steam and it would be good to see some of the people who left those reviews at the time perhaps update them (if they still play the game that is, as I know most of them got refunded and don't own it anymore)! Anyways hope this helped anybody on the fence about giving it a shot. Catch you all on the other side!			"

												The weapon system and overall combat was waaaaaayyyyy better in x3 terran conflict.  If this were reverted to the old system I would probably change my review to positive. The fact that you are essentially wed to one ship (the albion skunk) is perhaps its second biggest downfall as I feel as though there are far fewer ship types and therefore play styles available.  Oh also SETA drive (speeding time up by up to 10x should never have been removed)Terran Conflict was a better game except for the graphics and rebirth has a (minorly) improved fleet control system.   Also perhaps a slightly more engaging storyline. I do enjoy the improved stations a bit (the only real gameplay innovation and improvement.)Overall: Get x3 Terran conflict, its better.Edit:So they have put back in seta, which helps, but I still think x3 is a better game because you are not (effectively) tied to one ship, and I like the weapon system far better.

												First: If you are looking for a X3 style game move along. No its not the same as the X3 Trilogy.At launch this game was bugged beyond Jupiter and was not playable. But Egosoft really did its best and has made update after update to improve the game. I myself really like this game yeah you can't fly other ships. When i first started playing this did feel bleh meh and boooo! I was used to X3 beeing able to buy and fly what ever you got your hands on. But the more I played the more i got used to beeing in command and beeing in control from inside the cockpit of your ""small"" ship.From inside the cockpit of your ship you are in controll, you make your story, you deside what you or your ships do. You are in command. Trade, build or fight your way to fortune.Egosoft after the many updates that this game has had turned this game into a sollid one. They listen to the comunity, they add Ideas from player created mods to the main game. I hope this game will recieve many more updates and DLC before its replaced by the next X game.			"

												X: Rebirth, a game at launch that suffered terribly and seemed in many peoples eye the deathknell of the X Series. When it first released, Rebirth copped a lot of deserved flak, it was buggy, it was confusing and many of us were questionable about particular game elements. But that was a different time for Rebirth, and it has improved significantly since that time with its 2.0, 3.0 and soon to be released 4.0 and Home of Light DLC. Kudos to Egosoft to sticking to their guns where most developers would sink the franchise and move on.What stands out in Rebirth compared to other space sims of the day? It has incredibly deep gameplay in an incredibly beautiful and dynamic universe. There is a satisfying early, mid and late game as you gradually build up an empire of ships and stations and dominate interstellar markets with your own assembly lines and your fleet of trade-ships. You will always be up to something in Rebirth, whether thats scouting out potential bargains for your tradeships to supervising the construction of your first station or commanding your personal battlefleet into a war against one of the major factions. You can even be a pirate and steal wares and ships from any of the factions in the game. Every Star system in Rebirth is very unique, offering its own visual style, ship and station types (mostly), story and culture. Where other space-sim games like to go the procedural generation route, Rebirth offers a beautifully handcrafted galaxy that on the most part seems authentic.Rebirth still has its fair share of issues, the command system when dealing with NPCs can be frustrating at times and fleet commands still aren't that great, though it has improved substantially with adding basic commands that are necessary. NPCs are still stiff and bland and don't match the visual style of the outer galaxy, this was an issue with previous X games as well but its more jarring here as you are forced to interact with these NPCs more.Overall, if you like base-building, economic games, space-sim games, i'd definitely recommend X:Rebirth. With the Home of Light DLC coming out in the next few days which adds 3 new star systems (There are currently 6 systems pre-HoL ) it may be a good time to pick it up and give it a go.			"

												I own every X universe game from Beyond the Frontier through Rebirth. Unfortunately, there were so many ideas implemented in Rebirth that the game is a mish mash of disasters. I played for about 8 hours and then put the game away for about a year. Coming back, I have found that the game has been patched multiple times with some fairly significant improvements, but at the core, it is still a clunky mess.I will give egosoft credit though, the patches have made the game playable. I am about 10 hours in and have committed myself to seriously playing this game good or bad. I will update my review later with any new thoughts (9/24/15).What I like about Rebirth:* Space flight and combat* Potential to build stations/personal empireWhat I hate about Rebirth:* Highways* Boring fps style stations* hiring/recruiting/managing crew			"

												Don't listen to the non-fanboys.  This is a true spacegame.  It has a few flaws, but what game doesn't?  Tetris; that's it.If you want to play a scripted, repetitive game, play Elite Dangerous.  That game even lets you put on your boosters to your next waypoint, so that you can go do the laundry, dishes, and prepare dinner before you arrive at the destination.  Truly Immersive.This game provides freedom, environments with different asthetics, and Workshop mods.  It is obvious that the developers tried to make this an AI social experiment with you thrown in the middle of it.You don't compete with anyone but your own ambition--so, wait for a sale.			"

												I'm new to the  X series and I have no expectations related to the previous games, that being said I like the game, it has an actual campaign and shows you how to actually play the game instead of just thrustng you into space with no context of who you are, why you are there and what you need to do. I understand the game was released with a lot of bugs, but apparently they have cleaned up a lot of them and the mod community has made the game even better. Definately worth a look especially for the ten dollar holiday sale. I prefer this game over the much harder learning curve of games like Elite Dangerous also it's nice to get in a space sim that has aliens.			"

												Terrible game, I find it playing it bores me. Its all waiting and flying around looking at little icons, then flying down empty highways through empty sectors to find nothing there. Then theres the broken trading, which to be honest may as well stay broken as even if it were fixed it would still be boring. Just about every activity in the game is drawn out and boring. The performance is horrific for the vast majority, with frequent framerate drops to the high teens or lower. I have played it for as long as I can take, I have tried to play through all the bugs and poor performance top see if there is a deeper game hidden away waiting to be discovered, and found its just not there.

												I don't really get all the bad press on X Rebirth. There are definitely some serious flaws in the game but there is still alot to like about it and I wouls still recommend it, although with only about 18 hours in the pilots seat, I still have allot to investigate and try. Here's my opinion about what is good and bad about X Rebirth, not that my opinion matters...Good:-Awesome graphics. The game looks amazing and runs perfectly smooth on my system (i7 4970 @ 3.6ghz, GTX770, 16gb DDR3).-Lots of huge and wildly varied space stations and other vehicles to see.-Really cool Bladerunner/Fifth Element kind of atmosphere.-You can actually dock at the stations and get up and walk around the ship and into the station.-The ""highways"" and ""super highways"" IMHO are kind of a cool way to get around systems.-I have found ship to ship combat to be great fun in XR.-The ""flight"" controls, for me, are about as close to perfect as they can be. I use a G940 stick/pedals/throttle in a fighter jet sort of arangement except for the addition of strafing controls assigned to a little mini x/y axis hat. IMHO thia is an ideal setup for the way I like to ""fly"".-No fuel issues!!! In other space sims it seems like I am always about to run outta gas. Not an issue in XR.-The navigator argues with the ships computer.Bad:-Extremely limited systems and sectors. The XR universe, although quite varied and beautiful, feels very small compared to other space sims. I have an XR ""galaxy"" map and there aren't but maybe half a dozen systems on it. News flash! The 'verse is a whole lot bigger than that!-The system and sector maps just plane suck in XR. That's all I need to say about that.-I rarely ever have time to play multiplayer anything so it isn't that big of a deal to me, but no multiplayer at all? Really?-Only one ship with a really stupid name that cannot be changed. Although you can own other ships, you cannot pilot them although I have heard there are ""bridge"" mods so you can sort of ""be there"" on the bigger ships.-My trackIR 5 won't work in XR.-You can get off your ship and walk around the stations but all the stations and people are very generic and look alike. -No standard FTL/jumpdrive.-An FTL/Jumpdrive can be found now, thanks to the version 4.0/HoL update, but it isn't something you can just buy and install. Apparently there is some sort of quest for this experimental drive that has you trekking all over the galaxy, such as it is, looking for parts and pieces.-Did I mention that the system/sector maps really suck?-The navigator is always arguing with the ships computer. There may seem like more bad than good, but other than two or three of those issues, they are mostly just personal preference. There is still allot to like about XR and I definitely enjoy playing it.

The dev have lost sight of what the X series is. ONE ship? NO SETA? Station Scanning?! What is this junk? Its like the dev expects you to have fun constantly staring at their stations and thats not to mention walking inside their horrible design... way too repetitive. Fly to station, scan station, scan every individual module of station, land on station, hopefully find someone as a contact that can keep you up to date on station information, fly away to another station to do the exact same thing. It is agonizing. Stick to X3 Albion or TC			"

												Not everyone's cup of tea, not for the faint-hearted or impatient, not for those who can't move on from X3!This game has come a long way since release with a ton of bug fixes, feature improvements and slowly but surely a growing mod community.  Some of the fundamental design changes since the X3 games still haunt it - smalltalk is dull and irritating, customisation options are dumbed down, single ship, badly voiced and poorly scripted lifeless NPCs, slow slow slow progress.....But - it's addictive and what does work generally works well - it looks beautiful on a decent rig, flight paths are very realistic, scale is huge.Overall, I'd give it 7 out of 10 as of v3.50 but you can see the potential here and hopefully things will get better and better as more content and features are added.

												I waited actual years to buy this. I liked the first games, but was wary because of all the really horrible complaints made about it when it first debuted. So, I waited until it was on an unbeatable sale and picked it up. I still got robbed. Don't spend anything on this at all.I have now played more than enough hours to satisfy that stupid fanboy insistence that, ""You must play lots and lots of hours before you are authorized to comment on this game."" After many many hours, the word still is: to say that Egosoft is phoning it would be an insult to everyone that ever put forth sufficient effort to phone it in.Take all the good things about every other X game and throw it out. Sew the remnants together with used fishing line and bolster it with old carpet tacks. That is X Rebirth.Controls: 1 out of 5. Imagine Wing Commander 1 with half of the keys randomly not working. That would be a better control system than X Rebirth.AI: 1 out of 5. Nothing that it does makes any sense. The enemies are simply out to kill you for no apparent reason. Why do they hate you? Because(TM). Are they pirates? No, because pirates are trying to steal stuff to salvage it. These guys just kill you. Even if they have other enemies in zone that are more dangerous and/or more lucrative, they will always beeline to you to kill you. Because. Your ships... wow, don't even get me started. Whatever is the stupidest thing to do, they will probably do that. Otherwise, they'll do something else just so to keep their stupidity from becoming predictable.Graphics: 3 out of 5. The load times and pauses are not worth it. There is one female model and one male model, but with different (and progressively worse) hairstyles and clothing. It's like watching Frozen for the ten thousandth time, only without any of the fun. Or decent acting.Vocie actors: 1 out of 5. The main actor is ""eh"". Almost everyone else is so bad that it would be a crime against humanity if someone didn't parody it. They're not quite screwed up enough to reach Zero Wing status. It's clear that they just found random people that don't speak English to just give a go at whatever words were on the page. They didn't even bother to do a second take to clear up usage of the wrong word. The inflections are erratic... not in a cool way like G Man from Half Life, but more in a, ""My sister said she'd beat me up if I didn't do this, but she's not checking up on me so I'm just going to get through it as fast as possible"" way.Storyline: eh out of 5. Who can even tell if the story line is any good? I'd rather watch Star Wars Episode I.Bugs: Every so often, Egosoft releases another bug pack under the guise of some big patch. For every thing that they fix, five more things are broken. I don't believe that they want X Rebirth to be playable.Protect your sanity! Save yourself! STOP at Terran Conflict!			"

												Do not be drawn away by then 'mostly negitive'. This game had a bad release...very bad in fact. But guess what, Egosoft dosen't abandon it's children. No, they stay and rebuild, and what they have made out of it is worthy of the price tag.Honestly there are a few things to note.1: It's X:Rebirth, and removes a lot of ship controling and other features since X-3. It's more liken to the older X-Beyond the Frontier, in which you only owned one ship to fly, and upgraded it to suit your needs. X:Rebirth has attempted to bring back that feeling.2: They tried something new and it didn't turn out right. Honestly I hate when these games come out and everyone bashes them for being 'off target' from it's origenal. Do you seriously expect a game to sell if it's just a copy each time and no risks are taken? It dosen't work that way. Even Nintendo, the big daddy of video games, has experimented and gotten smashed. Paper Mario Sticker Star for example... The fact is, you can't judge a game completely on it's predisesor, as everyone is diffrent, the new game that comes will also change.So the game it's self visualy is breath taking. Giant super structure stations, wonderful space backgrounds, massive fire fights. The AI is also nice (But it's definatly not AGI) they can do some weird things, but are there to bring the automatic ecodemy and atmosphere of thousands to life. Gameplay can be rather dull at times, scaning stations, trading long distence with radios, running around on stations for offers and hidden godies. However, once you get an empire going you have meny things to do. The X series is a trading simulator in space with combat. Not a go shootem all up (that is until rather angry AGI and aliens attack.) My personal experience with the game is good. I've experienced very little problems other then a few scan points being inside the super structures (which you can glitch in and out of if you bounce around enough on it.) I recomend it for X series fans or someone who likes this type of game, but don't take this as the X series greatest impression. Play X-3 and it's expantions to get the full idea of how it works in good practice.			"

BEST X-Game EVERX: Rebirth is, for me, the VERY BEST GAME Egosoft have ever released, by a HUGE margin!To put that in context, I'm a LONG time X-phile, having played every game since the very first release: X: Beyond The Frontier (1999). While I've enjoyed each iteration in the series, there have been many things I found frustrating and, ultimately, after Albion Prelude (2011) I decided I'd had more than enough of being punished for my dreams: I vowed never to buy another Egosoft game.Earlier games were massive time sinks, Pretty and often fun, but requiring weeks if not months of REAL TIME graft to get to the big ticket rewards like capital ships and fleet battles. There was also an inordinate amount of tedious repetition involved in trading between sectors and stations. Worse, items always cost so damned much. New guns for your ship? That'll be hours of monotonous trading, please. New ship? Come back in a week!At their worst, earlier X games felt exactly like that real life job we are supposed to be gaming to escape from.  Dull, monotonous and frequently punishing. Some like that: for me, it was torture having the dream of a space game so close but unable to achieve it thanks to some obstinate design decisions. Because I love space games, and because Egosoft were producing the ONLY A-grade space games out there for the longest time, I held out like a battered husband, hoping things would eventually improve.X Rebirth is that game. The improvement I'd always hoped would happen.It had a very rough start. Egosoft should not, under any circumstances, have released the game in the state they did. By all accounts it was buggy and broken, on top of being a severe departure from earlier games. Not having bought it I sat back and laughed at my bullet-dodging cleverness.However, a couple of years later, after huge amounts of polish, tweaks and additions by Egosoft, Rebirth is now an absolute gem! A sparkling diamond in place of 1.0's jagged black coal. I've been playing it non-stop since I bought it. I can't stop playing it. This redesigned universe just makes so much more sense than it ever did. Activites make more sense, feel more logical. The graphical improvements are enormous, and a joy to behold (the stations are breathtaking!), but it's the gameplay that now really shines. So much opportunity everywhere! Missions that finally pay out decent rewards! Items priced low enough that a mission or two can afford them! I can repair my ships now without spending a week trading to offset the cost!I love this game!Yes, there are still wonky bits. The narrative is compelling but awkwardly told. NPC modelling and animation rarely looks right. Voice acting is average at best, ear-destroying at worst. The menu-driven UI can still be a bit fiddly. And there's so much to [re]learn. But these are now minor complaints considering the rest of the game design now offers so much fun.I heartily recommed buying X: Rebirth at the earliest opportunity!			"

												With the Rebirth 4.0 Update, I went ahead and bought the Home of Light DLC -because you deserve money for not tossing the game out and actually making it better (3.0)-, and then started a whole new game.I didn't actually pay attention to the 4.0 Patchlog, and completely forgot that I'd never seen Trade Deals and Mission lists in X Rebirth before, as well as the awesomely awesome tickboxes in property list. I didn't actually notice that I'd played from morning to morning until I got a surprisingly beneficial CTD (you should stop playing and go to bed now).This is completely and utterly playable and worth the NZ$48, and a must-buy at NZ$12 Sale. Haven't actually bothered leaving Omicron Lyrae yet, let alone newly explored the six or so other systems.Only issues are the mind-numbingly boring small-talk to get trade updates in every station because it is the most important thing ever (fixed by an auto-mod!) and the -graphics related (AMD?)- crashes and visual glitches, which aren't that bad if you keep autosave on. Also having to manually sell (or wait for someone to buy) your station wares; kind of wish managers used tradeships to sell as well as buy instead of just letting them wander around aimlessly until they need to buy something.I'm looking forward to XR:2.

												Now tbh I've never play any X games before so X:R is my first impression of the franchise. And I've got to say, it's not bad. the previous X games must be out of this world judging by the hate X:R is getting. Buggy yes, giltchy yes, massive frame drop at times yes. But i remain strangely charmed by this game. Maybe it's the huge freedom I have in the game universe, or that the game is so mod friendly that players disappointed by it can try to fix it with mods, or that the devs are still cranking out patches and fixes to a game that many think have killed the series. I would recommend this game to ppl that are fresh to the franchise and also old timers who might have rage quitted after the release. It is getting better, slowly.			"

												First off I Pre-orderded this game and have been messing with it since the beginning. Let me say that when we first played this game it would crash and crash and you get it. But now Egosoft has worked their asses off and have really fixed this game. This is a different type of X universe game compared to X2 and 3. The biggest difference you will notice is that you run in the same ship from the beginning to the end but you upgrade the weps and shields and engines and computers etc as you go. The controls are now very intuitive and easy to learn. The acting is a bit on the low end but the graphics and views of space are spectacular. There can be some issues regarding AI but for the most part just cancel the orders and reissue them seems to resolve the issues.Please give it a try and dont count the reviews from launch against it. Egosoft was true to their word and really did a good job making this game both playable and enjoyable.			"

												Don't. You will regret it.Missions are bugged - sandbox game has nearly no missions, multiple pointless cut scense and walking round crappy stations. A horrible control system. Improvements being made but ever so slowly and players leaving in mass.A fine example of how not to make a game. Tried to stay with the game because of the X Series but I think this release will kill off this Egosoft due to the game description being complete tosh.			"

												If you've been following the release of this game, you may remember how disastrous, buggy, and unfinished the initial product was.  Egosoft has done a great job fixing the game up and making it playable.  There are still some missing features, but overall the game itself is great.  If you've never played a game from the X series (and even if you have) there's a good chance you'll probably like this game.  However, I cannot personally recommend it.  Whenever I play this game, it feels like something is missing.  The game lacks... a heart and soul, especially when you compare it to its most recent predecessors, X3:Terran Conflict and the expansion X3:Albion Prelude.  Patches are still being released for this game, so if something changes, I'll reconsider my review, but for now... I'd say buy something else.			"

												A poor attempt at a sequel.  I've been waiting for this game to release since i heard of it being on the drawing boards.  I waited to see what would be fixed in patches and updates but sadly the game is to lack luster for me to want to pour any more time into it.   I have played every X game since  they have created and still believe that X III Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude are a much better game.  You have more freedom to jump from ship to ship and command fleets.  you may not have the asthetics of X rebirth or the FP point of view in stations what the game lacks in those areas they make up for in the content that you receive.  At first i tried to reveiw this game without using my preconceptions of the earlier games but cannot because they were that much better off.   A polished turd is still a turd.			"

												With 4.0 and the home light expansion pack this is an excellent game. I enjoy it almost as much as x3 but I do miss flying different ships. Also you can mod this game to do a ton. I find myself hunting down large ships blowing up the turrets and then boarding them and capturing the ship. Then I sell it or add it to my fleet. It is a totally different game then it was when it originally came out and thats something that egosoft is good at they update their games and fix issues way down the line unlike some.			"

												Love the game, sunk hundreds of hours into the game. with the addition of mods and lots of ships, the game fufills the desire to stand aboard your capital ship and pummel the enemy to dust.On the negetive side, once the campain is complete, fleet is assembled, there really is no drive for establishing stations and trade.Late Game BoringThough i love the X series and X Rebirth, i think the game needs a better ""End Game:"" there begins to be nothing for you to do when you have a massive fleet , stable trade, and tons of money. there is no diplomacy, fleet upkeep, and most of all variety of ships.    -Diplomacy would make you feel like you are a real faction when you are growing yore empire    -Fleet upkeep, whether that would be more pay for crew, or licenses to hold that many ships until you have an empire, would make reaching a stale state much harder    -The ship variety is only a personal point, i make it a point to collect all ships, and when you have a bunch that have a very similar artistic style, it gets a bit boring.    -smaller factions and engagements would add some dimension to the game.     -the game seems a bit small. compared to say X3 ( which you cant escape) you were in a small fighter and a large world, where you are in the equivalent of a well equipped Katina which could be the goal for the next X game.All in all love the games and sunk thousands of hours into them and i respect you as game Devs.			"

												X Rebirth is a reboot of the previous X Series games. I first got into the X Series back in X2: The Threat. Being able to command big capital ships was something that was a very memorable experience. Trying to get into big fleet battles was interesting. You had the whole universe of hundreds of systems to play in and play with which is the best part of any X Series game. X Rebirth was something of a disaster, especially at launch. Many of the bugs were fixed with upcoming updates for X Rebirth but the gameplay and the Freedom that was once there is no more. You no longer have the freedom to fly other small ships or “Captain” Capital Ships in any way or form. You can “Own” many ships but cannot “Fly” any ship. You are locked to a ship named “Albion Skunk”, ♥♥♥♥ poor name in my opinion, and are limited in not only a dozen weapons.There are only, currently I believe 4 or 5 systems vs the Hundreds of systems previously accessible in the other X Series games. Would rather have hundreds of systems to explore rather than 4 or 5 with smaller sub areas you can visit. X Rebirth, has certainly improved somewhat in combat and most certainly graphically from its predecessors. There are many new gameplay mechanics, such as the Space Highway System, Bigger Space Stations with multiple dock locations and areas to explore. However, many interiors are identical to one another, faces on all characters are all nearly the same and various other small things just almost don’t make it worth your time to dock and talk to people. There have been many improvements since Launch, and some great content has been added. But the freedom to do what you want, that made the other X Games so successful, is no longer there. To summarize this all up without going into a 5 page essay as to why this game is a disaster, I would NOT recommend buying the game unless you got money to blow.			"

												This game is currently beta-quality, and it has many, sometimes game-breaking, bugs. If bugs and performance issues turn you off, then you should not consider purchasing this game for at least a few weeks. However, this is NOT an abandoned title. The developers are keen on fixing these bugs, and they release regular weekly updates which do improve the game.If you are coming from older X-titles, then you probably expect more of the same. While many things were carried over from the older games, X Rebirth is very different in many respects (for better or worse):GOOD (non-exhaustive list):• The universe feels more alive than in previous X-titles.• The space-flight visuals are often cinematic, reminiscent of sequences from movies like Blade Runner and The Fifth Element.• Fewer loading screens. Similar to other open world games, such as Skyrim, or GTA, you can travel vast distances without encountering a loading screen. The highways, for instance, will save you hours of travel, but you are also free to travel outside of them if you wish.• Capital ships appear much more massive than in the prior X-titles. Dock with one of these ships and walk around on its platform in the middle of a heated battle, and you will feel very small.• I have not finished the campaign, admittedly due to bugs, but so far I do enjoy it more than the campaigns in prior X-titles.SORTA-GOOD, SORTA-BAD (non-exhaustive):• You may only fly one ship. Some people will enjoy the fact that the game has been balanced around the abilities of a single playable ship. Others, especially veterans of the prior X games, may miss the freedom to choose what to fly.• SETA is gone, replaced by a more immersive system of highways which connect zones together, offering fast (yet still interactive) travel between them. Without SETA, unfortunately, some players will grow impatient as their trade ships lumber toward their destinations.• You may now walk around inside stations. There is a lot of potential for gameplay-depth here, but the feature is currently not very engaging and appears unfinished.BAD (non-exhaustive):• Trades are tedious. Expect to babysit each of your trade ships. Automation made trading tolerable for me in the prior X-titles, but this feature doesn't seem to exist in X Rebirth. Not yet, anyway.• The NPC models are ugly. I don’t know whether it’s the artificial gravity, or the lack of a proper atmosphere, but human skin apparently doesn’t hold up well in space — expect to either laugh or cringe at the organic sights that await you on space stations and capital ships.• Stations, although populated with NPCs, feel mostly lifeless. NPCs sit, stand, or weld metal objects, but rarely do anything else — they do not interact with each other, nor do they walk around with any purpose whatsoever. This aspect of the game needs a lot of improvement.CONCLUSION:X Rebirth is an incredibly ambitious game, and when it works it delivers an experience you won’t find anywhere else. At times the game is frustrating, but the developer is working hard to address the issues. I recommend this game to enthusiasts of the space genre who do not mind paying full-price for a game that is still beta-quality.			"

I present the 1990s quality NPC graphics as evidence of being significatnly overmatched in this regard.

												On the one hand, as a veteran of the X3s (I came to the X-Universe with Reunion) I need to say this game is not X4, which I found disappointing even though Egosoft warned us all along it wouldn't be.Whilst I am tempted to say the game isn't that great or engrossing, the truth is at the time of writing this Steam has me at 520 hours of playtime (vs the ~1800 I have between X3TC & X3AP since I got the Steam versions) meaning that my impression of how much I enjoy this game must be a little off (obviously I play it too much to enjoy it as little as I think I do).I do recommend starting with the Campaign, as the tutorial is baked into it, & you get a unique asset.All things considered I do think XR offers the Build, Fight, Think, & Trade that characterises the X-Universe, it just does so differently.Most tellingly, is my belief that if Egosoft releases an XR2 or an X4 (or both), I will buy it(/them) on the strength of previous successes, including this one.

												I can't recommend this game, even though I'm probably one of the most patient guys, when it comes to bugs and slow grinding, micromanage demanding games. The release version was awful, the campaign completely broken and unplayable and the framerate unacceptable. I have an iCore5 Haswell  CPU with 8GB of gaming RAM and an ATI 7700 Series graphics cards. I could barely muster 15 frame per second, which made me feel like being in the 90s, the only kid stuck with an 5 year old Pentium and can't play any latest games. This is not the case here. I can't actually find a game, that would bring my computer down so much. Not even Crysis 3. And Rebirth isn't even that great looking to begin with.As of this review, the game is patched to 1.21 and the framerate has improved and some bugs have been corrected.  Regardless of patches, there are much much deeper problems with this game. I doubt they ever gonna be fixed, since they are ""features"". Appearantly, the dev team thought, that everyone wants to navigate a space trading/fighting simulator with an XBOX controller, where there are multiple menus and submenus and sub-sub-sub menus to deal with, instead of giving a simple keyboard shortcut. Appearantly, they forgot, that PC games have 101 keys + at least 3 mouse buttons. I won't even mention people, who got joysticks. Here is an awful example to compare: Battlefield or Call of Duty both are heavily console-aimed (now), and yet I got shortcut keys for everything, even joystick support for flight.  And we are talking about a simple shooter on a comparabily small map to play on, unlike Rebirth, which has numerous sectors, zones, systems and stations. I could go on with the menu system starmap, which I have never even heard of.  Dumb down games like Mass Effect has a starmap for crying out loud, even though the space part of game is just some visual  addition, not really required. Here is the deal.   You may have fun looking at the space stations and flying around for a bit. Heck...you may even have some fun successfully trading or pirating a freighter from the enemy faction.  But I can almost guarantee, that this game will go stale on you, once you realize , that after the first space station built with tremendous amount of work to be done, you'll be doing the same thing for the rest of the time you play. It's not getting easier, it's not getting harder, because you could have billions of credits if the raw materials needed are not there, or you have to travel for 1 hour all around in the sectors to find a cargo freighter carrying the right stuff. By the time you get to that cargo ship, you'll realize, that your traders are stuck somewhere or being destroyed, without your knowledge,  or your trading computer ""forgot"" where things are bought and sold and the sectors you have already scanned are showing up again as unscanned. You are going to get sick of this game real fast and only the most patient will go ahead to continue for a while, possibly install 10s or 20s of mods just to get by or constantly edit his save file to make it someone bearable. Avoid it...wait for some great space games coming out next  year (Elite: Dangerous, Star Citizen), which are already probably in a better state as alphas, than this ""release"" version of a giant mess called Rebirth.

												This company is a small German company that has done reasonably well in the past.  This is beyond the pale, the little company that could knew what they were good at and abandoned that.  It began life as the ""next greatest thing"", a console game ... which they failed at miserably.  Then they attemped to port something that was already a loser to the PC platform.  Or this seems to be the case.  I have been watching them for many years and own almost every thing they ever made.  Most of it was good and enjoyable.  This is neither, and the worst part is that they knew it and lied about it's state to keep thier company afloat.  In simple terms, it is horrible.  It is nothing like their other work, and after this ... I am done with them.  I paid 60$ US for a 5$ game at best.In simple they lied, they stole.  I quit.GearHeadAKAMrOldGamerUPDATE 6/13/2014I have to give them some credit.  It seems that with some of the money that they took from us, they hired someone who specializes in fixing disasters. (or so it would seem)  I see some fundamental changes that show a move towards a real game ... maybe in another year or so.  Question ... I thought that the rest of the world was supposed to be more honest?  If so then why didn't Egosoft use Kickstart or some other means of similar funding?  It certianly would have attracted a good following.Soooo ... for now three thumbs down (instead of 4) and one thumb up.  (Still a fail for now).  I would like to think that they will do the right thing and finish the game ... but that remains to be seen.MrOldGamer			"

												X Rebirth is such a massive letdown, that it's almost hard to quantify exactly what the game has done right.  If you want to buy this, do yourself a favor and just slam your dangly-bits in a door.  It will honestly feel far better than the disappointment of paying actual money for this steaming heap of donkey-waste.  Being probed for hours with a dry wooden spoon would be more satisfying than even 20 minutes of this ""game"".  If you're still actually considering buying this, just press the power button on your computer and walk away.  Trust me, you'll be glad you did.			"

												I cannot speak to the gameplay of X Rebirth itself, so you'll need to read a different review for that, because my system with an I7 OC to 4 GHZ, 32 GB of Ram and Dual GTX 680s run the game at 15 to 30 FPS. Avoid this game until the performance issues are corrected, right now it is unplayable.			"

												The game had potential, but at this point in time I wouldn't waste the money on it there are other games that will work far better as a trading/space sim. Go back to X3 Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude if you want a enjoyable experience.Sadly as many people expected there are to many bugs and design flaws for this game to be truly enjoyable. The one truly good point about this game is the developers did spend a large amount of time making it stunning visually. The depth of a planet you get close to the stars within the game all the lighting and particle effects are top notch, but the good news stops there.Unlike the other games in the x series you are limited to one ship with the ability to use drones. The drones themselves have various uses but in the end seem superficial compared to being able to pilot full fighters. The worst part about this feature is your ship many times will get completely destroyed as you try and use the drones even when there was no threats present.In addition to this the so call ""reactive/interactive economy"" is anything but either. Most of the ships in game are fluff as bots that have no purpose other than to make the space ports and space station's look busy. The ships you can interact with seem to randomly disappear after leaving/docking with stations or ships on some occasion's. its disappointing that such a huge part of the prior X games is regulated to a unusable mess.Everything within the game from getting your other ships to do as you want to trading bulk items #i.e. energy cells and such# is nothing but a complicated chore that ruins any hope of you having fun or at least feeling like you accomplishing something. In addition to this many of the in game commands and the very ships which made up such a big part of the other X games will not respond, move, or work in any way no matter what you need them to do. The ability to move around stations is a bit fun but ultimately pointless. It seems the real reason you go from station to station is to rob the lockers of items and get illegal items in air ducts to supplement your cash flow as you cant get anything else within the game to work for making money properly. Though there are workarounds for these issues you should not need them as you spent money on a game that should of been ready after 7 years.Lastly we have combat something truly enjoyable within the prior X series. Its sad, boring, dull, uninspired, slow. If you though you would have fun  think again. As stated before you only have one ship. Wanted tons of turrets? Think again. Wanted to be able to use 8 front mounted plasma throwers? Not gonna happen. You can have one of each weapon but that's ONE only. There are no multiple banks of weapons on your ship and no way to add them. The customization you can do to the ship is very shallow when compared to the other games within this series.The final verdict is i would hope and try to believe that this game will be fixed by the developers. If not them than the gaming community at large through many mods that defined other games in this series. Alas i cannot see this happening as most of the issues seem to stem from core portions of this game not something that can be modded or fixed without major changes to the game it self. We will just have to wait for the next true X series game or perhaps the new Star Citizen that seems to have allot of promise.			"

												X Rebirth has come a long long way since it's initial launch. With patch after patch after patch egosoft has managed to make a really enjoyable game out of something that could only have been described as a buggy pile of £$%& on launch. Had it been pushed out in this form on release day it would never have gotten the reputation that it now has.I've played a good few hours now & there was absolutely nothing game breaking, very very few little bugs & a decent depth of gameplay. The universe feels alive (with plenty of ships running between stations, trading fighting, policing and everything in between. It's a gem of a game, a rough one to be sure, but the amount of effort that egosoft is putting into it is now coming to fruition.A great game.			"

												By far this is the worst game that I have had to even try and play. I believe that we all have been lied to and that it all was one big Marketing Scam. I so wish for a refund as I fully believe that the developers lied about saying that they spend 7 years making this game. It is broken and is not ready for launch. The space graphics are good but the interal graphics in stations are absolutely terrible.This is the era of Engines like Cryengine 3 / 4 ect ect and many more realistic like engines.I don`t think it is fair on gamers when they believe in something and then find out it was one big lie!!! where the developers are sitting with our money in there pockets for a game that is by far not ready for launch with so many bugs!!!!!

												False advertising at its most blatant - ""easier than ever to start with, and remains as deep as fans expect"". Sure, space looks pretty, but there's a whole lot of ugly under the hood. The interface is stunningly broken (made for controllers, at the expense of the traditional and most effective flight sim control scheme on PC - joystick/mouse/keyboard), the AI is atrociously poorly implemented (won't follow orders, there are many orders you *can't* give, such as meaningful fleet control or automated trading by stations or ships), the setting is far smaller than previous games in the series (and the map is utterly useless), every station is identical or nearly so (down to the ""hidden loot items"" being in the same place in each).If you believe the marketing, if you expect this to be anything like previous X games, prepare to be sorely disappointed. There's a reason the Metacritic score for this game isn't shown on the Steam store page for it.			"

												The game really needed an additional year in the oven before releasing. What Egosoft was thinking when they released it in 2013 is beyond me. At its launch, the game was terrible. Barely anything worked, game breaking bugs were everywhere, it felt more like an alpha test for the game than anything else and because of that it suffered. I decided back then that I wouldn't give it a review due to the sour taste it left in my mouth and just put it on the backburner for 3 years. Yea ... 3 years. When I saw the 4.0 update I decided that it was time I gave the game another chance, a lot of people were praising it since the Teladi Outpost DLC for beginning to show its colors as an X game.All the bugs that existed since launch have been fixed, I've managed to complete the campaign without hitting any kind of issue. The story has its ups and down, but in my opinion its final act and ending are not what I expected and somewhat unimpressive. The good part about it is that it leaves you wanting more.The gameplay is what you'd expect from an X game. You start with a ship, some credits and your personal skills. What you do from there (if you don't start with the campaign) its up to you. Either go the route of a pirate and harrass the NPCs till the dawn of time, take on missions that are either combat, trading or exploring, go out on an exploration trip to find rare materials that can sell for a high price or maybe even some derelict ships you can capture or just build up an empire and slowly conquer the galaxy. Yep, just like an X game. Now there is one thing I need to mention. What is a very big different between this X game and previous titles is that you cannot fly more than 1 ship. You better get used to the Albion (Pride) Skunk because that's the ship you'll fly till the dawn of time. And yes, you can reconfigure your cockpit so you can have a difference look about your ship, but honestly, its still just one ship. Right now, the game is worth buying. If you can overlook some minor gripes like the 1 ship only thing, then the game is very enjoyable. Especially the empire building aspect of it.			"

												First things to know:-I started playing at version 3.20-I know it had a bad launch-It is not X4That being said, it is a great game!Like I said, I have not experienced the game-breaking bugs that most player experienced at launch.Egosoft really worked hard to make this game better, and are still releasing patches to fix/add/polish content.I remember playing X3: Reunion years ago. It has tons of problems, but they fixed them in later patches. Then Terran Conflict came out: very similar to Reunion but way better. So I knew that a bad launch was not going to be a problem in the long run.I understand the frustration of early buyers and fans, but now it is a great game.You still see on forums the usual ""is the game still broken?"" posts. To those people I say: it is perfectly playable.I had one crash to desktop, but it was my fault (alt-tabing during screen-resolution changes on a dual-monitor setup, the game did not like it).I run the game at maxed out graphs, on a 1920x1080 resolution: no slow-downs in fps.So here are my pros and cons:Pros:+Beautiful game+Nice micromanaging+Lots of options to choose from+Great gameplay (altho different from other games in the series, again: not X4)+Constant improvements from the dev team (thanks!)+Good music & sound effectsCons:-Repetitive dialogs-Some few-years-ago character models-The interface needs a little getting used toSo for all space-sim fans out there: I recommend the game. If you read reviews of the game, be sure to note that old ones might be from older states of the game, which was indeed bad, so for those who never played the game, at version 3.20 (3.50 soon!): it is a good time to start. And for those who bought the game when it was bad: now is time to give it another try! "

												A rather embarrassing failure of the space genre to put it lightly. This game delivers only in the form of graphics. The gameplay, the core essence of a game beyond any other factor as proven by titles such as minecraft, is a washed up combination of casual elements that don't come together in any sort of rewarding experience. A vast number of features are bugged or broken in some way and even the enjoyable parts of this game cannot be reached. Stay away, save your cash, there are brighter spots on the horizon.			"

												I am a big fan of strategy games especially those in space.  Clocked up many hours on X3 and two years on Eve.  It took a couple of years for me to buy this but as a trickle of good reviews started to appear (and great value discount over Christmas) then I purchased including both DLC's.  What I like: - plenty to do- requires some thought and research (this is not an easy game but help is out there)- great graphics- excellent mods that make this even more enjoyable (although I personally avoid the cheat versions)- space actually seems real due to some good dialog with NPC's (ok some can get repetitive)- different to X3 in many areas but if it wasnt then why not carrying on playing X3What I would like to see- station complex's- fly more ships (although in X3 once past trader stage I mainly stayed in the same M6 ship)- greater character development and rewards as this drives me to play more and suspect the same for most gamers as why do so many of the great games have it?Well worth a try but don't expect it to be easy and thanks Egosoft for making the improvements (although surprised you don't launch Xrebirth 2 to drop the hangover from the poor initial release)			"

												Edit: The below was written at the time of the initial release, and I gotta hand it to egosoft; they never game up on this game and they've done a massive number of fixes, feature adds/changes and content updates. The game was released with version 1.0 and at the time of this edit it is v2.50 - with a v3.0 on the way for December 2014. A lot has changed, and I personally haven't tested the game since. Added that they offered an upcoming DLC free for those that already have the game, it seems Egosoft is trying hard to make up for the launch mess. So there is yet hope that this review might turn into a thumbs up soon.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you're a fan of the serries like I am, there is one word to describe this latest installment: disappointment. The game launched with more bugs than it has features. Added to these bugs are performance issues - but what is really disturbing with this latter is why it's there to begin with: The game is built on directx 9,  and a quick look into the config files, etc shows XBOX 360 commands all around.Yes, the best way to explain why this game turns out to be so disappointing can simply be understood from that: it's a revamped down X game made having consoles in mind. The menus and controls reflect this (seriously, you don't even have keyboard shortcuts for targetting) and it takes out most of what made the X series what they were.But it doesn't end there. You pilot one ship throughout the game (yes, only one) and if you have additional ships in your fleet, they can't even be in a different sector than you. So long for massive space empires. Given the AI is next to nothing, these ships stand and look pretty most of the time instead of firing their turrets or trading.Ah yes, trading. Gone are the days you could dock at a station and trade directly. You have to assign a frigate you can't pilot yourself to do that and wait half and hour for it to dock and do it (you don't have seta). So when the lack of AI and major bugs get in the way, you curse having lost that half an hour and start editing the save file just for the game to keep running on.Well, you would expect dogfights to be good since you have one ship - it would be optimized you'd think. No chance. Dogfights are sitting duck shoots whether you're fighting a cap ship or a small fighter. Again, it's an AI problem.The big thing with this X game that we all were excited about was to walk around stations ... guess, how it turned out? Yes. a disaster. All stations have almost the same interior where all walking around adds to the game is to open crates and get minor items. All these crates look the same and you wouldn't wanna do that all the time, trust me. Except, you have to; you can't disable it. Even if you wanted to talk with someone at the station, you have to dock and open some crates and walk around and open some crates and finally find the person to buy a ship upgrade (if you're lucky and it doesn't bug that is).Granted, the X games were always launched as a mess - and tidied up later on. But this is not the kind of mess that can be tidied up - neither by egosoft nor the modding community. The basic motto is not there: trade, fight, build, think? Can't properly trade, no challenge in fighting can't build wherever I want and all it makes me think about is what good I can write for the game in this review (without any success).I've already written long and haven't yet touched some major problems (NPCs, highways, etc). I won't either. I believe you got my point. This game is released as an unfinished mess, but even if it is patched up in the near future, what we'll have is not an X game that we were expecting. The biggest sandbox in the X universe? No it's not. That's an outright false statement.			"

												An unfortunate disappointment.Broken & Buggy:While some elements have been streamlined and are more fun than previous entries in the franchise (combat, maneuvering, traveling), the amount of commonly reproduced game-breaking bugs stop that. Launch bugs are to be expected, but this is equivalent to an early beta/access game - which this is not identified as. Required tutorial story line missions are stuck in a broken state that can't progress. Saving the game sometimes crashes and destroys progress. Basic issues that should have been caught haven't been - walk in front of a scripted robot cleaning the wall? Get pushed through the wall. Stand in front of a vent and open it? The grate lifts you, sticks you to the wall above it, and disables you from closing it. Sometimes, while looking at the ship's in-cockpit UI, the UI becomes non-interactive and can't be left.Awkward:Even for a game in the X franchise, this has the poorest usability of the series. Somehow, the focus on immersion lost out to having a decent, playable game. Having to wait for length animations for basic functionality that a player would do often adds to the tedium for the sake of immersion. Despite being in-space, navigation involves entering an animation where the character pushes back, rotates his seat, and waits for a display to activate. During this, the game world is active, so don't count on quickly breaking from navigation to defend your self. Accept a mission to pick up and transport a passenger? Dock and hoof it through repetitive hallways to that duplicated, shoddy model of the passenger, talk to them (without skipping dialogue), wait through their boarding cutscene, then hoof it or teleport to your ship. Want to ask an NPC for directions to a drone trader? Talk to them, press a dozen keys to navigate through multi-level, multi-paged sets of dialogue options in a Mass Effect style dialogue wheel, 6 at a time (4 + ""More"" + ""Back""), until you find Drone Trader, so that NPCs can randomly decline to inform you *after* you've went through 20 - 30 seconds of this UI to hear a snide rejecting remark. The cut for entering the cockpit of your ship teleports from one side of the ship to the next with no fade - akward and unpolished. While entering the seat, the seat animation seems to be mirrored for your copilot so that she flails and rotates in an inhuman fashion. All of this you must bear each and every time you do so and there is no option to skip.Really wanted to love this - played previous entries in the franchise, played Eve-Online, played Freelancer, played Strike Suit Zero, supporting Star Citizen - but this is a very poor release and very, very poorly designed for any target audience. What would be immersive is just tedious, distracting, and counters any immersion with glaring flaws.			"

Unfortunatly, the launch version is a buggy, unplayable mess.With a swift patching cycle, full moddability and a strong community, I believe the game will shine up brightly in the long run. But for now, I'd advise giving the game a very wide berth, it's hard to over-state just how unplayably broken the game is right now, calling it a ""beta version"" would be generous.			"

												You are the pilot of the Albion Skunk, why is it called the Skunk? Quite frankly because it stinks, this game has tons of potential but so far isn't living up to it, if you are a fan of the X3 games for the sandbox style of play, give this game a wide berth for now until the modding community finishes what Egosoft started. As it stands, you can only pilot the Skunk which might be tolerable if it was a capital ship but no, it's a simple fighter. Also the menu systems bring you to a dead stop so issuing commands in battle may do more damage then it's worth. Drones can be controlled by the player, but what point is there in using drones when your ship sits still for the enemies? I mean, you have a co-pilot that won't actually co-pilot, all she will do is pretty much sit there as a conversation piece. To be honest, i miss my auto-pillock from X3, granted it would crash me into stations now and then, but atleast it MOVED MY SHIP instead of having me sit there doing NOTHING.Update: Auto-Pillock is back! and the first thing it did was slam me into the station i was undocking from... Artificial difficulty make this less of an actual space sim and more of an FPS. problems from my original review are still present. will do another update at 3.0 or when patching is dropped due to being unable to plug the dam with a finger.Update: New menu system WOO!!! Game is more tolerable now :D Can also purchase smaller ships so you don't need to keep hunting capital ship crews, Omicron Lyrae has the coolest looking small ships imo ^~^ Short update for now since 3.0 is around the corning, can't wait for the profit oppertunities <3Update: The new DLC didn't add much imo. Still don't recommend this game in it's current state.			"

												Total Joke , after waiting so long for so much , no alpha was done, no beta was done and 'OMG' what the hell was the dev team thinking when they built and supposedly released a SPACE SIMULATOR ? I got a plan, lets add some FPS run about crap on space stations that really , well i simply can't write what i want to .. Then theres the totally annoying cockpit, a crappy co pilot, a Galaxy map that a 3 year old could do a better job with, 1, yes ONE ship that you can fly, no choice, trading that you cant do yourself... i give up... Very gutted with this release. You managed to end the X series with this, if ANYONE can prove that wrong, let me know.. :)			"

												Much better since the 4.0 upgrade patch vs. launch.  Thank you Egosoft for continuing your work on this.  The DLC are okay, though I have not spent much time with them yet.  Mod support is decent.  While driving a single ship around is different from X:3 (I enjoyed working my way up to a functional trade ship from nothing), you get used to it.   I have not really used drones that much aside from sabotaging things, maybe repair, and maybe for missle defense.  I have not gotten into building massive stations and constructs yet beyond what the campaign required, so I can't comment on the economy too much.  I am now starting a free play/sandbox in the Home of Light DLC now to see how starting from scratch in the middle of nowhere works out.  So far, so good.			"

												This is the most disappointing thing I've ever bought. Compared to the last entries, it is a joke. I could not get past the third story mission due to bugs. The interface is tedious, your view is over half obscured with flashy yet useless ship dashboard, and the living breathing world has two stations layouts. I tried to get a refund, on account of it running at 12 fps on a system that exceeds the reccommended specs, but was denied. It has half the features of any previous entries, and the ones that remain have been ""reimagined"" into clunky, absurd versions of themselves.Do not waste your money.			"

												Comparing to Egosoft's previous X3 Albion Prelude, X-Rebirth is completely terrible. They've shrunk the universe to a miniature scale. The Empire aspect is completely removed. You're limited to the one ship compared to nearly every ship. The game is filled with gamebreaking bugs. The only thing to really do in this is constantly run missions. 0/10			"

												X-Rebirth drew in a lot of hype from the X fans from what I remember seeing. It was due to renew a truly epic (albeit somewhat hardcore) series. I feel that failed.To explain how I think Rebirth failed, I feel that it was the choice of components they overhauled that was the bad decision.Giving us a 1-command-ship system. This was a big mistake in my opinion. Although upgradeable, it ends up limiting fighting capabilities without relying on AI support, effectively making the player more like a little commander who sometimes needs to hide behind his other, AI-controlled, ships.Station Trading was another critical failure in my opinion. We've always had AI merchants at stations. But they weren't our main option, and they were easy to access. We just opened a menu. It was actually easier in the past. Having to haul around a station's recycled interior to find traders and get info is really annoying at times, and keeping the old comms-menu from X3 but with the new characters would have been great in my opinion. Having points on a station we need to explore to access was a little odd too. It wasn't a critical flaw, but surely it would be easier to detect any mission-givers around a whole station upon detecting the station? Assuming they are legal missions, of course. Seems odd to have them practically hide their missions.If the developers had stuck with a more centralized station-interaction, I think half the issues with stations would be avoided.Back to the player's ship. The Co-Pilot. I wouldn't believe the developers if they told me the voice-actress read the script before-hand, given the voice-acting quality. Also there's a serious limit to what she says, which just makes it worse. I've heard ""Now shut up Betty!"" a few too many times for one game series. I can understand forcing her to be present in the campaign, but in freeplay it would be better if she wasn't there at all. Now, NPC-interaction. This is kind of the same issue as the stations, as they are just tough to track down and we have to intentionally go seeking through more menus than before to find them. Surely if they are publicly revealing their presence, then wouldn't it be easier to download station information across all access points on the station? I had quite the hard time trying to find the right NPC for anything I wanted. Especially construction. Although in hindsight I was told that getting NPC's for stations was just due to them being in select areas. Again, the issue that they aren't obvious without my manual searching.My final big criticism is the new menu system itself. It's great that Egosoft  wanted easier-access. But what we ended up with is a really odd side-menu that just didn't agree with any decent resolutions. I run 1920x1080, which I feel isn't exactly out of the norm these days, but damnit the menus feel so chunky and so...console-ish, courtesy of the bloated interface. I assume Egosoft made it this way to save on visual differences and for immersion, but it really didn't pay off in my opinion. The new system seems to have focused too much on being nice to the new controller support (Although Albion-Prelude had it too, at least it was designed for keyboard and mouse). Re-arrangement would have helped newcomers to the series, but the old menu system, to me anyway, felt far more effective, far less chunky, and left players with greater control.Overall, I'm giving X-Rebirth 5/10. They did well overhauling transit, graphics, AI-pathfinding, and ship-control, but failed on so many other fronts. I'm probably adding 1 extra point out of 10 on just for the nice main menu. (Again, in my opinion.). Only modding can save it now.			"

												After a really shaky start about a year ago, the game is not only playable but completely addictive. The release of v.3.0 added a host of features and new galaxies which have brought the game alive, bringing much of the enjoyment of X3 to this verions of the game with the added bonus of being extremely pretty. The game is also enhanced by the multiple mods which can be accessed easily through the steam workshop, which, far from being cheats, add gameplay and interest without destroying the game balance.Definitely recommended although you will no doubt be saying goodbye to friends, family and a healthy social life!

												EDIT 28-08-16Below my 1st review. but after having checked SC and ED pages, i had to add these 2 lines. in opposition to what i first said during my first review, i have to say that Star citizen is not a fiction but definitely a reality, and a serious competitor to X-rebirth. same for Elite, i was first saying it was pretty pricey, but after having checked their page, i must admit that their prices have been seriously reduced. so these things taken apart, my review below is still validfirst review:Best sci-fi/space opera around+ amazing graphics+ enterable stations. you can go to the bar and talk with NPC+ ship customization+ trade. you can buy/sell almost anything. from vegetables to illegal waste. you can do it using your personal ship or using large cargos you add to your fleet+ economy/empire creation. not gone very deep into this yet. but it seems you can build your own stations and build very large ships too+ mining+ loot wrecks+ drones. there are drones of all kind. recon drones, electronic warfare drones, defense drones+ boarding. you need to send drones to hijack the target defense systems, then you need to destroy its jump engine, and then you send troops+ cash missions (passenger transport, cargo shipping, infrastructures destruction..)+ (obsolete) a reality not like Star citizen+ (obsolete) a one time purchase not like Elite D+ plenty of stuff to do not like No man's sky+ you're in for lot of comtemplative 0 stress flights not like Eve- no ship interiors. only a small cinematic when you land- even if enterable, space stations interiors look pretty much all the same- semi-automatic landings. would have been better to have more interaction when landingneutral only one pilotable ship. i don't care myself, but i know this is annoying for lot of peopleneutral needs a good config to be able to play maxed out (like any game that can draw hundreds of objects at once). i'm myself almost maxed out with an i5, an R9 290 4096 & 16 gigdon't pay attention to the huge numbers of bad reviews. this was because of a very poor optimization when the game first came out years ago. the first version is just an old memory now, and in its actual shape the game is a great space opera			"

												If you want a good space sim, where you get to do whatever you want in a vast universe... go buy X3: Albion Prelude, not this piece of junk.Even with all the patches and updates that this game has received, it has hardly improved at all. It is horribly optimized and very buggy, with many features poorly explained, explained incorrectly, or just not explained at all.The storyline is rushed and muddled, forcing the player through mind-numblingly boring missions, for factions  that you don't care about, with several jumps and gaps that made me feel like I was missing information. Even X3 had a better plot, and trust me, that's really saying something.Your companion is incredibly annoying, and frequently yells at your ship AI system for no reason, which is even more annoying than the ship AI itself.Speaking of your ship, it's a piece of garbage, and can for some strange reason only use one gun at any time, a monumental change to combat compared to all other X series games. You can upgrade some parts of your ship to make it slightly less garbage, but in general you'll wish you could take some other ships for a fly-out. But no, you're stuck in the Albion Skunk. To make a bad situation worse, if you want to capture a ship that someone else has bailed from, to add it to your squad, you need to have a spare pilot already on your ship. Apparently all these ships lost all that autonomous AI tech that was around 60 (in-universe) years ago.I can see where Egosoft was trying to go with this game, and I was willing to give them time to work on and improve this game, but now, after 2 expansions, 4 major versions, and 3 years, the game still has horrible UI, optimization, characters, cutscenes, dialogue, and interaction. Trading is a convoluted mess, combat is boring, exploration feels tedious, and in general, this is not a fun game to play.So, I urge you, go look for something else. There are some fantastic space sims out on the market now, or about to be released. If you don't have the budget for something triple-A, X3: Albion Prelude and X3: Terran Conflict are both far superior to this game, and often go on sale for under $10.			"

												Short review: If you really want to try this game, either (A) wait for a great sale (at least 1/2 off) or (B) buy X3 Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude. Long review: Simulation games, especially space simulators run a very tight rope. They must be open enough to allow the player to experience the universe, but structured and formatted well enough to ensure the experience is a fun and pleasant one. Anyone who has seen 2001: a Space Odyssey knows that simulating space exactly would be maddening, boring, and above all, not really a game. In the past, Egosoft has managed (with a great deal of modder and community help) to make an enjoyable space sim. They managed to balance the openness of the universe with (albeit a bit buggy) mechanics. Although the learning curve was steep, the rewards were worth it when you found yourself the ruler of an interstellar empire. For X rebirth, Egosoft decided to sprint full speed ahead, oblivious to that balancing act, and fell off that rope before it even managed a single step.Pros: (1) Graphics update, (2) Capital ships have subsystems you can target strategically, (3) Boarding and training marines are more straightforward, no more chasing marines in space or waiting for them to train. (4) I managed to finish a full length novel and download another on my kindle while waiting for things to happen.Cons: (1) You have 1 ship. Which wouldn't be bad if (A) you could actually customize it beyond 1 upgrade for each option, (B) you could actually customize the ship itself, beyond changing the glass layout in the cockpit, (C) your AI ships weren't braindead or hell, even (D) if you had a copilot that did more than argue with the computer and (2) almost half my total play time was spent wasting time doing NOTHING while I waited for (A) NPC trade runs to complete, (B) trading to complete, so that construction could continue to complete, (C) follow/escort missions to complete, (D) scripted events to start, (E) scripted events to complete, (F) NPCs talking to themselves, especially during D and E, (G) navigating menus while listening to NPCs flirt with me about their ""wares"". (I even managed to finish an entire novel in the time I was waiting! I kept it close by for these times)(3) The design, and trade menus are awkward to navigate, having been designed for xbox360. There is no depth in the commands, options, or details of the ships. It is nearly impossible to compare ships or their capabilities without using Roguey's site, and even then, there's no real reason to choose a different AI ship because (4) AI is terrible. Normally this would mean that your other ships were on equal footing. However, based on the design and lack of command options, your ships will not attack unless you yourself are attacked, or you navigate three menues to command them to attack a target chosen from the map screen while you are under fire. They also love to run right next to enemy ships (especially the capital ships) instead of using long range weaposn. (5) Repairing capital ships is a giant waste of time, and takes forever; repairing any non-capital ships is impossible without a mod. In other words, anything less than a capital ship is useless. (6) Everything requires an AI NPC, that you must carry around in the back of your ship to transport. Built a station? Needs a manager and a rare speciallist that you must find in a wild goose chase.  Just capped a ship? Better hope you already have a captain, defense officer, and engineer sitting behind you! While I get the idea that capital ships need officers, there is no way to have a ""transport"" ship keep these NPC's around for you. And god help you if there are no suitable candidates with the skills you need in nearby stations, or you've run out of space for freeloaders in the back. (7) NPC skills have no visible or explained effect. My 5 star all around captain/defense officer combo is equally as useless as my 1 star duo. On the same ship. In the same fight...(8) You must visit every station, constantly, in order to trade. Want to trade somewhere you already visited? TOO BAD! Since the two minutes you last docked there, the trade offer is gone. Note: the trade offer is still there, but you have to revisit to remember it is there!(9) Voice issues and translations: while I understand there are translational issues, a single english speaking person could have cleaned up 90% of the voice over issues. Heck, I might have preferred their native speakers to voice it, with subtitles, as opposed to hearing terribly performed, gramatically incorrect gibberish.(10) If there is a ""story"" in this game, it is hidden behind hours of waiting, incoherent english, bugs, and useless interface. (11) I'm pretty sure the game is about some guy named Ben who found a laser space skunk and trained it to fight ""the man"" (and then robots I think?) alongside a pair of breasts in a skintight suit with a strategic breast window. They are named Isha and Terran. "

You attempted to dumb down the existing complexity, but instead you merely convoluted everything through a new cumbersome half baked console driven UI and interaction menu system. Things that you thought took ""too much effort"" to display or review before, take even longer now. 2.) You took a play right out of Apple's playbook, and flat REMOVED features because you knew best. What happened to all the key bindings? Too complicated, gone. Want to target the nearest hostile? Nope, you think gamepads are the future, no bindings for that. Want to quickly spot your proximity to others on the Gravidar? Nope, gone.. you need to fly aimlessly around stations scanning for anything relevant. Earth & Beyond I am totally surprised nobody has mentioned this one. Maybe this shows my age, but for those of you who don't know... there once existed (emphasis there) a game studio called Westwood. OH yes, many of you know it, and if you don't.. you should. They were hugely successful. They brought us the Dune Series, Command & Conquer, and then one day, they decided they would build a space MMO called Earth & Beyond. I subscribed, and I played it up until it flopped and failed miserably. I can't begin to tell you how similar it felt running around stations that were lifeless, only to interact with zombie NPCs who had nothing better to do but stand there. Things that could have been accomplished quicker from space and ship menus, HAD to be station oriented because ""it was cool"" and the developers believed in a fallacy that it's what gamers wanted. Yes, you hear players say this over and over, ""Man someday it would be awesome if we could get out of our ships and walk around stations."" Sounds good in theory, but has failed in practice, in every space game I have ever encountered, short of ONE game that was heavily story RPG oriented. Mass Effect. Do you know what happened to Westwood after their Earth & Beyond debacle? They closed their doors. The company liquidated. Yes, they aren't Egosoft. But Egosoft are not immune to these kinds of failings. And I can assure you, this has an eerie resemblance. Borderlands To make station visiting ""worth"" the time sink, Egosoft decided to put in ""lootable"" boxes or crates in the stations. It has a striking resemblance to wandering around a zone in Borderlands opening crate after crate to get loot, or more commonly, endless amounts of nickels and quarters. Freelancer Not to bash Microsoft, because Freelancer was actually a hugely successful game. The only problem here is, X has never been a Freelancer game. But for some odd reason, Egosoft decided to stick you in one ship and have you wander around the galaxy, bouncing from station to station doing missions and trade runs like this was ""partially"" a Freelancer game now. Where are the vast control for the 100's of TS/TP ships as Sector and Universe Traders going about their trade runs you meticulously configured? It's gone, except in the form of ""Squads"" where your ""owned"" ships follow you around the lagged Universe, hoping YOU might know where everybody is actually going. Oblivion For those who played Bethesda's Oblivion, you will remember the god awful NPC happiness system. You would spend stupid amounts of time flirting, threatening, or joking with NPC's for a little ""kickback"" on prices or information. Egosoft has tried this out with their ""Small Talk"" dialogue options on NPCs. Sounds interesting at first, but it becomes mindless drab and not only did players hate it, but Bethesda learned their lesson and removed it from their future games. Skyrim was a huge success, because not only did Bethesda go back to the drawing board, but they learned some valuable lessons and REMEMBERED them going forward. What exactly happened at Egosoft? The whole community already knows you learned valuable lessons, but it's like you came down with an epidemic of alzheimers when you worked for 7 years on Rebirth. X Rebirth: The True Problem We all know Egosoft has a stellar track record to listen to the community and patch games with a plethora of fixes and new content. This is undisputed by nearly everybody who has been here long enough. But you see, the problem with Rebirth is more severe than the typical game launch issues, bugs, performance problems, broken missions, etc. No, the problem with Rebirth is the inherent DESIGN. It's 7 year design. And yes, the modding community can do a LOT of things to improve games. Even change them to a certain degree. But I can assure you, as a full time software developer in both business and video games (and enthusiast modder for many games in my life) this one is very hard to fix, IF you are looking for classic X2/X3 game mechanics. Egosoft is faced with making drastic underlining design code changes to bring their community what it wants right now. I'm sorry, but that's just the reality of this situation right now. Graphics The graphics are actually very pretty. In space. I wont talk about the stations. But I do enjoy the overhaul to the station exteriors. The lighting and all the effects. While in space, it is definitely a sexy looking game. But that is all I can find, in me, that makes me want to play Rebirth. It's pretty when flying around in space. IN SPACE. Not wandering around cookie cutter stations like E&B. I like the sector/zone highways. And i'm still not sure what to think about the ""Highway Leapfrog"" mini-game that goes on when traveling through the highway system. In fact, I kind of hate looking straight up the tail pipe of other ships, crowding my already diminished view of space to make room for a beautiful cockpit which you can't even free-look. Again, not to be crass here... but as an experienced software engineer, hell even in space games as an Indie, I have to ask Egosoft, what exactly did you accomplish in 7 years? Best Regards, and good luck. "

												I've played this game since the fail that it was at launch was so not ready then but I guess it was a investors vs devs deadline they worked against back then.Since that time however patches have come dlcs have come and really improved the game other negative reviews I would really ignore as the game is a diamond in the rough.How ever your still tied to one ship for some this is a issue to me I don't mind as I can be lazy and get the captains of my capital ships to fly me long distances altho a few mods and the latest dlc add a jump drive to da skunk.Bottom line is Egosoft deserve a second chance with this game to those who left negative reviews play again and review under the latest update of 4.0+Those that haven't played this game try the free demo I believe they are offering  "

												I bought into the hype pre-launch and thought the game would be fantastic. In the 7 hours I played the game hard crashed 6 times and I lost save data every time. To complete a tutorial mission I had to edit a game save file in notepad and put my mission state further ahead because of a bugged ship that got stuck. After I finally finished the tutorial I closed the game and never touched it again.The entire thing is optimized terribly and even in my high-end machine I could barely break 20FPS at the lowest possible settings. And I mean lowest. Don't be fooled by the screenshots on this store page. They don't reflect anything I ever saw with 12gb RAM, GTX 760 and a Core i7. It seems like when you walk around on foot the game is not only simulating, but rendering all of the activity outside of the station which causes it to run like complete trash even when you're standing still, doing nothing. Now they are rebranding as ""X Rebirth 2.0"" but don't be fooled, it's the same game with the same ♥♥♥♥ optimization. In the 7 months since launch they fixed a lot of the mission bugs and added the ability to not bother leaving your ship to go out on foot.  I think they also added some new cockpits and some different start conditions. But, maybe the worst part about the game is that even with all the bugs and optimization fixes, I don't think it was very good as a game... I only completed the tutorial so I don't have a great perspective but from what I played it was slow, clunky, and not fun. Cherry on top: The price of this game hasn't dropped a dime since release. They are still selling it for $50. This game is not worth $50. If I could get a refund I would. That 33/100 metacritic rating doesn't lie.			"

												*** U P D A T E *** 12th March 2015 - Got it again as a present. I tried it after 15 months from release and it's much much better.Graphic is cool and no fps issues for me in space. Stations are still horrible and boring. Mods help a bit (thanks, Modders). I still can't recommend it because of the lack of contents and monotony of the sidequests. Main quest is still bugged sometimes. The choice of having only one ship at all and few upgrades makes feel the game ""smaller"". It's not bad at all, cool graphic in space and some funny skirmishes, but i wouldn't feel that i lack something if it wasn't in my Steam library.27th nov, 2013 I got a refund on this game from Steam ... this can explain the status of the game, better than all the words of the world.26th nov, 2013 - Asked for a refund. That's just trash, letteraly burn 50€ can be more funny than this...Egosoft can't expect that ""the community""(mods and so on) fixes their games. Absolutely bugged on release, even the TUTORIAL is broken(remember to save!!You'll have to reload many times hoping to find your personal way to avoid breaks).It's an xbox port(that never came out for xbox), and not a good one. Gameplay is boring. AI too. Ui is awful. Most of the spaceships that i encounter are simply ""enviroment""..you can shot them and there is no reaction from them(only a voice that says you are losing faction points). Boarding an enemy ship is broken 50% of tries, at the moment. Trade is obscure by now, scavenging the space worths more. Main story is silly and secondary quests are repetitive. Raccomended only by/to fanboys. X3 TC - AP are better than this.			"

												You know when you create a new version of something it's usually to add to the good features of the previous ones and remove the bad bits?Well it looks like someone at Egosoft got a bit confused with that! from what i can tell they have added one good feature (ability to disable individual systems on large ships by careful aiming), however they have removed everything else that was good about X3! They have implemented some completely idiotic game mechanics, like the need to walk around spacestations to complete certain tasks (all of which look the same) or the stupid highway system, which not only is an annoying mini-game, it's also based around something that only works within an atmosphere with air resistance!you have no ability to look around in the cockpit (freelook) even though the cockpit seems to be fully 3d, you can only fly one ship, upgrading is ♥♥♥♥, i wanted to keep this short so i'm not gonna keep listing the dumbass decisions they made!I've not even started on the bugs, yeah they have fixed a load of crashes, but what about the AI repeatedly flying straight into a satillite dish and bouncing around like fish in a tank.I don't understand how a company with such good titles like X2 and X3 can go so very wrong! they have both failed to satisfy fans and failed to make the game accessable to new players, Well done Egosoft!

												Big fan of any of the previous games, but this... this is just awful. The graphics are very beautiful, the stations especially. Well, on the outside at least. And this is one of the MAJOR flaws with the game: You walk aroud. Outside your ships. In stations. And its horrible. Copy & Paste hallways with copy & paste rooms filled with copy & paste characters that serve no purpose other then overcomplicate trading and quests. And that annoying co-pilot you get... Complaining all the time about the ships repetitive computer voice with the same comments over and over. The irony is stunning.

												If you loved X, X2, or X3, then you probably won't love this failed console port waste of time. What could you do in the other games that you can not do here? Almost everything. They dumbed down about every part of the X franchise for 8 year olds that throw games on the floor with any depth.Now, all that being said, Egosoft has always had a hell of a community. They were always modding the game, improving it for the better. Egosoft realized this and has in the past released player created content as 'Signed' content, meaning its possible to obtain it without modding the vanilla game.  So could modders do something crazy with this game in the future, I'm sure they could.Like I hinted at above, they have dumbed down about every aspect of the game here to appease a younger generation with a higher need for instant gratification. You pilot one ship, not a super awesome highly customizable ship that you can really make your own either. There's like 5 different types of components that you can buy for your ship, and maybe a variety of 3 for each component. One engine gives more speed, and less maneuverable thrust, one gives more maneuverable thrust less speed, and one is a 'balanced' option. Could having one ship if dont correctly be ok? I'm sure it could be, but this wasn't it. It's not exciting to buy upgrades for your ship when there really is only a couple ways to go.Another problem, not only could you not really customize your ship, but you are not worthy of a cargo bay. Modders have attacked this already, but the base game left out your personal ability to trade. To trade you had to take one of your ships that is meant for the ware you are trying to buy and order it to make the purchase while you are there in sector. What a most horrible system. In the other X games you could order your ship half way across the galaxy to do something, true freedomThe weapons made for your player ship are dumbed down versions of the older X games as well. Maneuvering your ship is easy, and fighting is as advertised, but like I said, no customizability. 5 Different weapons, MK1 and MK2 of each, what trash.I could tell you 100 different woes of this game, just trust me when I say that this is no X game. There are a variety of plays on the word rebirth out there that people are calling this game, and rightfully so. The game was released broken (expected as its an egosoft game, but who cares about that, they always fix their games. It's the game itself that has the problem) and there's no feel left from previous games.In retrospect, maybe after a year when the modding community tears this apart from the inside out will it be a real game. For now, wait for this to go in the bargain bin for 2.50.			"

												I understood prior to purchasing this game it was not going to be X3 TC/AP. I watched the trailers and thought it would be a very fun game to play with some new ideas and to possible take the game in a different direction. I do like playing space games, I have played EVE, Sins of a Solar Empire, Starpoint Gemini, Pax Imperia, Alpha Centauri, Galatic Civilizations, Star Wars MMO (Beta Tester), X3 TC/AP and I played some pay to play space game in the mid 90s but forgot the name and maybe a few others I have forgot to mention. Yes the game was bugged at launch, I could play the game at decent FPS but I experienced game breaking bugs so could not play. As of the latest patches 1 month into the game my FPS has tanked to the point of unplayable but a lot of the game breaking bugs were corrected.I gave the game 1 month and approximately 15 hours and will not be going back to the game. The design decisions that I thought would be great are for a lack of a better word horrible. I am either faced with game breaking bugs or horrible FPS.I am not recommending the game if you want a space game in anyway similar to a lot of space games out there. This one has taken the Space genre into a weird direction with basic functionality that is standard and decided to not put it in the game.To any thinking about purchasing this game during the Christmas season, please rethink the decision for at least another 11 months to give them a year.I will not ask or attempt a refund, I purchased the game and will live with the decision. In Novemeber of 2014 I will try the game again and will provide another review.			"

												5/10If they made a good tutorial, it could be a cool game.If they used better graphics, it could be cool game.If they world didn't feel cold and impersonal, it could be a cool game.If they didn't make the management system clunker than a box of rocks, it could be a good game. It the game didn't freeze up and crash sometimes, it could be a cool game.If the game didn't feel overly complicated and confusing the first second you try to do something, it could be a cool game.If it were easy to navigate the world, it could be a cool game.Really, the only thing that was done right was the cockpit looks cool, the story seems interesting, and the world is very big.HOWEVER:They did just release version 2.0, and it looks to be very improved. Also after playing the game allot more, I've discovered it's actaully really cool if you can stick out the steep learning curve, and overly complicated systems. My only new criticism, is that they need to explain more things in game or make them simpler, and the story diffictulty needs to scale. 1.) It took me forever to figure out why I couldn't trade some cargo. Turns out, I didn't have a ship capable of tradding it. (It was canister type cargo, my ship could only hold bulk type cargo.)2.) I've gotten to a point in the story where I have to enguage in massive combat. I didn't know I needed to upgrade my ship, and now my sheilds are too weak, but I can't afford new sheidls, so back to attempting to trade.I still play this game, I still like it, but it has it's flaws.5/10			"

												Definitely not worth the $50. Too full of gamebreaking bugs, and still, after several patches, has a few. And thats just in addition to all the minor annoying bugs and glitches, which REALLY should be the only bugs they should fight at this point. After 70 hours played, i'm fed up of it, and i haven't even done 50% of the main story missions yet, and i doubt i ever will, unless i REALLY have nothing else to do.  I was positive at first, even after 50-60 hours played...then they only introduced new bugs in the bugfixes, which led me to think this game will never be fixed. Keep clear, unless you want to buy overpriced frustration.			"

												As a veteran of playing this type of games, (started with Elite on C64), played X-BTF, X-Tension, X2: The Threat, X3: Reunion, X3:TC, X3: AP, this one is truly worst of all, commands are confusing, gameplay is boring, some ideas shown in game are great (e.g. remote controlled drones), and completly new.Map system is disaster, still can't get used to it, trading, even after few attempts i didn't manage to get my capital ship to actually buy something. Tutorial i had to do 5 or 6 times due to crashes of game.And for people with stereoscopic screens, don't even bother with 3D, cocpit is completly f.... up.For now i will stick with X3: TC or Albion Prelude			"

												*Short Summary at the bottom*X Rebirth... there is so much to say about this game, nearly nothing nice to say though ( the fact that this game single handedly killed off the entire X community, should make it clearer just how much not nice is to say about this game ), sure, the game kinda looks nice, but that is also the best you can say about the game.the game is so full of bugs, that I had to use all 10 save files + quick saves to have any progress, because I kept breaking the game to the point where loading an earlier save was the only solution ( this happened extremely often ).I admit having my game save modified to get the required amount of money for the 1 Billion achievement, but only because of a magical money drain in the game that caused me to lose money constantly, seriously, 1 billion, gone in 2 days of not spending money ( never found out what did that ( the log over everything, had no info about any money being spent either ) ).The game is dumbed down and restricts you the entire way, even in the other game modes, you will never have anywhere near the freedom you had in the earlier games.Without any spoilers, the Champaign mode is broken on several levels, it ends in a way that makes you go: and what next.... wait... was that it.....

So buying it is a gamble in several ways, you may not even be able to launch it ( it ran in about a steady 30FPS for me from day 1, no clue why ), it may run, but at 2FPS, or it may run just fine at 30-60FPS, but you have no way of knowing before having bought the game.If you are a fan of the old X games and want to know what happened after the X3 games, you have my condolences, walk away, you never saw this, it ended with the X3 games, and that is all you honestly want to know.I think I have said all that I wanted to say, while staying as objective as I can, so for the short summary for those that didn't want to read all of this.*Summary*The game is a buggy abomination that is a waste of your time, money and potentially treasured memories of the earlier X games, and may not even be playable if you buy it.

												Turn, and run.  I played nearly all the predecessors from the series and, assuming this would be another iterative improvement with a new engine and better UI, got sucked into a pre-order.  This is not the X game you were looking for. It doesn't even seem to be an X game, just a console port that was never accepted for its console of choice, and so was sadly pushed into a PC launch wayyy before it was finished.  Ubiquitous bugs aside, the game just isn't done.  Maybe another year of development could have turned it into something special, but then it would have to compete with Elite and Star Citizen, something I sadly cannot see this game ever doing.  You can see what they were trying to do, but oh my did they miss the target, every time.  It just feels like a poorly implemented console game with none of the richness and depth that made the X series what it is (was).  Maybe in a year with a heap of community mods this will be worth 5 bucks on sale, but I hesitate to even hope that much.  You can get WIng Commander Privateer 2 on GOG for 5 bucks now.			"

												This is not an X game, and can barely be called a space sim. It may have been concieved with the best of intentions, but it has arrived thoroughly destroyed by mechanics, optimization, and flaws. I wasted $50 on what I fully expected to be an awe-inspiring experience. After stumbling across X3:Terran Conflict a few years after it released and putting in several hundred hours, this Rebirth is just not up to par.Bottom line, is that someday, this game may be decent. It would require an immense amount of work and possibly even a re-release free of charge to those like me who wrongfully assumed that since X3 was so incredible, its successor would be as well. I truly wanted to like this game, but I can't.			"

												This game is just wow. I love space games. Don't be put off by all the negative reveiews. It's honestly a great game. The only bad thing about it is that its extremely confusing at first and then gets slightly repetitive. There are plenty of videos and tutorials online but they arent the best. I've played about 50 hours so far and only figured out i could make my own trade routes about ten hours ago. rather then the ones given. The graphics are amazing. You can build ur own stations and manage a huge starship fleet. There are different starts to the game. If ur willing to put in the time to learn to play then plz get it. The modding community is really good too. About ten pages of good quality mods. I could keep listing things off but itd be easier if you'd just buy it. Get the DLC's too.			"

												What a massive disappointment. Sure there are some neat thing, like being able to dock on capital ships and watch it move through space from the cargo hold...but it's far overshadowed by the fact this game is far too buggy and feels way too incomplete. Unlike X3:AP where you could do pretty much anything you wanted to do (campaigns, contracts, building a trading empire, wage war against a faction, etc...), the only thing you can really do in this game that seems significant is the lousy campaign.I don't think patches can save this game. You're better off just getting X3:AP if you want a complex space sim.			"

												Dreadful step backwards from X3, on which I logged many hours. Every aspect of the gameplay is dumbed down and noticebly worse, which makes this by far the most disappointing game I have ever purchased. The basic control scheme is poor, the UI is near impossible to use, the game chugs along even on high end systems, it crashes all the time, the character modelling is about ten years out of date, you're restricted to one ship, you can't even switch to an external view... the list is endless. To make matters worse - despite the UI being dumbed down it's massively more difficult and cumbersome to perform even the most basic trade tasks, which makes the game nigh on impossible to play if you can even get it started up at more than six fps in the first place. Avoid it.			"

												The disappointment of the year right here. Always liked the X-series for its open-world experience and ""do whatever you want"" feel. This game however is the exact opposite. There is no longer any form of automation of trading or station ownership and the new highway system makes the world feel small and overcrowded, though it strictly is not. A blatant attempt at making a space-game for consoles gone wrong and then they decided to release it for PC to get something out of it. Buy Terran Conflict or Albion Prelude instead.DON'T BUY THIS!

Second of all, the sectors are all F'ed up, the map sucks worse than anything I have ever seen or used before.  The game relenlessly crashes and you have to pretty much keep your finger on the F5 quicksave every few minutes. I'm running a high end PC which apparently make the game run like crap... that's a new one!   This game has been in production from what I hear, over 7 years and THIS IS THE CRAP THEY CAME UP WITH!  Visually the game is quite appealing at high settings, but of course if you're PC is high end, it's unplayable as it'll make you rage quit with so much FPS lag.

												Yes, at the beginning the game was pretty terrible. I forgot it for more than 2 years. But given ES's history of fixing their games, I was pretty sure they will fix it. And they did. What I do not not understand is why to do such a horrible release in the first place?  And don't say to me is about money, because it isn't, or at least it should not be. Why? Because DeepSilver and ES new that they are releasing an incomplete product. That means they should be able to deduce that there will be no money in a long term as public ratings will not let sales to improve. So, what was the logic? I doubt that DeepSilver was out of money. I think DeepSilver was simply indifferent, maybe it was their way of saying ""promises must be kept"". But hell no. The one who says it, does not understands software industry and should not be in it as per se. You always, always plan for delays and set offs in such huge projects. Thats why DS does not even have any huge games except X series. They simply do not know to work with such projects.Quality means money and thats one thing they forgot. Now they are paying for missing it. There are other ways to fund such projects. Why not to use those? ES has a user base, has products, has a good history. Why not to use it?			"

												Don't let the bad reviews dating from launch fool you, X Rebirth as it is now in 3.6 is a very very good game. You still need to mod it to get the best out of it but everything is readily available in the steam workshop. Great game if you are into empire building. That feeling of taking on a small mission, not being able to cut it and just calling in a full capital fleet to wipe the map with the baddies, all the while watching the action unfold from the bridge of your flagship (Youll need to DL the mod for this) is pretty damn good. Complex economy is pretty fun too. Though I was clever and got one of my enemies to shoot at a neutral station. Well it worked and the station opened up on the capships following me, declaring war on my enemy by doing so, only this station was one of the few producing a very rare ware and with it's haulers now at war it could barely produce, spiking prices all over the galaxy -.- That being said, want to make a load of money and have fun with corporate espionnage? Go sabotage stations competing with you, lower your costs and pick up all your competition's clients while you're at it. Game has lots of depth if you want to play around with it.Severe shortage of guides and tutorials though, be patient and ask questions on steam discussions.			"

												I've been a big fan of the series, logging hundreds of hours between X3 Reunion, X3 Terran Conflict, and Albion Prelude and am sorry to say that Rebirth is my biggest disappointment in recent memory. Three weeks after release and Egosoft has yet to provide a game which is either functional or optimized. Numerous bugs and poor graphical performance (even on high-end rigs) still plague the game. This may have been forgivable, but in the few hours I've been able to play, due to game breaking glitches, there isn't much to miss. The menu system is counter-intuitive and show none, I repeat NONE of the information I look to see on ships, stats, et cetera. The map system is an oddly unintelligible, two-dimensional take that is unhelpful. Moreover, the new highway system and removal of the autopilot feature from X3 makes navigation a committed and tedious process. In all of my save games, the trading is irrepairabily broken because trade ships wil not dock with stations to buy/sell goods, but this isn't a huge problem as it prevents me from continuing in the trite campaign missions (sarcasm). I can reconcile that with the tedium and obtuse nature of trade in this game. Unlike X3 where you could issue buy/sell orders to ships remotely without being near the station(s) where the orders were placed, X: Rebirth requires you to fly to each and every station to place each an every order in a system that is simply ludicrous. Overall, a HUGE step back in what was a fantastic series. Not only am I out $50 on this game, but I've lost all faith in future releases from the X series and Egosoft.			"

												Bad news first;This was more of a letdown than Duke Nukem Forever.  I love the X series.  I've bought the games more than once.  This does not belong in the series.  The only controller that works right is the Xbox 360 controller, and the entire interface is made around being a console game.  The game only uses DirectX 9 (like Xbox 360), and the story line missions are buggy and you can get stuck and have to manually edit your gamesave in order to continue the game to fix things yourself.  This really feels like a failed console game that was ported to PC that was never supposed to be in the X universe.Industry standard controllers, like the Saitek X52, do not work.  The button mapping is buggy, as well.  It sees everything as an XBox 360 controller stick for some reason.  Also, it won't let you map more functions to a keyboard and mouse than you could to an XBox 360 controller.  This is a PC game that is constrained by a console controller's limitations.I'm still in the tutorial and it bugged out on me and stopped giving me any story missions or objectives about 10 minutes in.  Now I'm abandoned.The ""universe"" is tiny.  There's only one camera view for your ship and only one small ship to fly.  You will not be commanding a large capitol ship yourself into epic battles.There are maybe 10 different NPCs reused everywhere and only 3 different tiny interiors of space station ports.  Going inside of the space stations is obnoxiously painful, and the NPCs treat you rudely for no reason and repeat the same few phrases over and over.  It is also a pain to find the vendors you trade with and the interface to trade is awful.  It's just like a big F You when I am talking to every NPC to try to get the story to progress and trigger something, and they all end a conversation with something snarky like ""Nice chat.  NOT!""  The economy is less advanced than current convenient stores.  It's seriously like each little port is a mostly empty farmer's market with a few NPCs that will trade with you, but you have to find them and sit through their insulting chat.There is a trading system you can do from your ship, but I cannot figure out for the life of me if I am buying or selling items and where they are going or where the money is going.  I don't know if I'm buying missles or selling them.  What is the difference between To Sales and To Offers?  I have no idea.  I think I accidentally sold all of my missles, which I thought were on my little ship, but maybe my large ship had them?  I couldn't figure it out at all.There is no radar for space battles.   No radar.  NO RADAR.  How do you dogfight with no radar to track enemies?  All you have is pointers around your view screen for directions.Oh yeah.  No targetting, either.The Good:The art design for the ships and exteriors of the space stations are amazing.  The art direction really is inspiringly beautiful in how they designed things.  You can get a sense for the purpose of various parts of stations and ships just by looking at them.  It is a joy to first explore them.  Even with only DirectX 9, they did an amazing job for how it looks when you fly around.  (the NPCs and interiors of stations are not that inspiring, though.  The NPCs are especially creepy with how their face pops onto your screen first, then body parts appear at different times and they materialize in front of you, due to pop in)The sound is nice.One thing the devs did is almost amazing enough to send them a thank you, though.  The save files are .xml files, which means they are human parsable ane plain text, so you can edit them pretty easily when you need to fix things... or give yourself tons of money, because the economy is so painfully implemented that it isn't worth the time to make money legitimately.  Why do I like this so much?  Because it is a single player game and people want to cheat or do fun things with a game to sandbox it when they want to.  Many people will install ""trainers"" that are loaded with malware in order to cheat, or install other cheat engine programs that will get you blocked by some online games just for being on your computer, or are also fillled with malware.It's time to bring cheats back to games.  ♥♥♥♥ acchievements and ♥♥♥♥ encrypted save files.  Thanks to the emphasis on acchievements in the game industry, debug modes and cheat codes have disappeared so that people don't cheat to get some virtual trophy.  The result is giant botnets of malware infested users sending spam, helping to DDoS, and make the internet a worse place, because they install some trainer and now their system is compromised.  Kudos to the devs for letting their users do what they want with their own single player games.What it would take for me to change my mind about this game;Revamp the interface to make sense for keyboard and mouse.  You can keep the console option for big screen mode people, but give us a choice.Fix joystick and key mapping support, especially for the X52, wink winkLet me map to more keys than an Xbox 360 controller can handle.Put in the traditional targetting and a radarRemove the interiors of space stations and just give me some giant landing bays that let me add a station to my trade network that I can access forever from my ship.  Look, right now, in real life, I can use this magical internet to buy or sell anything I want, and even more things that I don't want.  THE FUTURE WOULD HAVE SOMETHING BETTER.  STOP TURNING SPACE TRADING INTO FARMER'S MARKETS.  No one would do that with the technology available.  THIS MAKES NO SENSE.Fix the story mission bugsGive me fleet management tools that let me make decisions that don't ever involve flying to a ship to talk to someone in person.  I should never have to dock inside one of my ships unless I am delivering a physical person or object.			"

												An unfortunately incomplete game that doesn't live up to the expectations of the series.The game has relatively good graphics for a space game, but is highly unoptimised with frame rates coming out quite low.The gameplay has been somewhat limited compared to the previous games, with the player only able to pilot a single ship (though it is a flexible ship with plenty of capacity for modification). In an attempt to create more immersion within the game the player can now walk around inside the space stations, however this is very poorly done. The stations feel dead and empty. Their is very little personality, with the NPCs all being generic. There appears to still be the capacity to set up the same economic empires that were possible in the previous games.I think this game is not what it could have been, though I hope this is remedied in the future. Currently I would give it a miss and check out the earlier games in the series. Or check out the upcoming 'Star Citizen' (which isn't on Steam and is still in development).			"

												Having played one of the free weekends. I'm surprised that this game is voted at Mostly Negative. While I wasn't there to see the initial horribly broken release. Whatever post-launch version I was playing was enjoyable, immersive, and in a way outright addicting. Though, if you're expecting some Epic Story-Driven Saga like Mass Effect or something more combat-focused like Star Citizen, then this is not your cup of tea. This game is more akin to older space sim types that your basically a simple cog in the larger galactic economy machine, which makes it partially similar to Eve. So in essence it's more of you being a random person earning a living in space while slowly building your reputation like the other X games.The game does take some learning (took me like 3+ hours to finally figure out what's what), but after that it was pretty much sooth sailing			"

												Still buggy as hell. It works for the most part, but then suddenly autopilot manages to get you stuck in part of a station your trying to dock at, once or twice, fair enough, but after 5 tries, it becomes unbarable.Secondly..... and this is the killer bit for myself, i do agree that a steep learning curve is required for a game like this, however it doesnt help you one little bit when 99/100 of the requests it wants you to perform, it doesnt give any hints or tips on how to achieve them.Ive gotten fed up of pausing the game to google a walkthrough to find out what to do.A simple tip like ""fly into cargo container"" wouldnt go amiss to have in the game yet your left wondering how the hell are you meant to collect cargo floating in space.final straw.

												There's enough reviews out there that discuss the pros and cons of this game in great detail but all you really need to know is this: X Rebirth is not a space simulator, it's a disastrous attempt at making an FPS in space.I was stupid enough to preorder it and even withheld from giving it a rating it deserved for a while because I knew all Egosoft games would come out rough around the edges but get patched and polished over the following years. Not this time though. Two years since the release, the game is still a bug-ridden, unoptimized mess that plays nothing like a proper sci-fi space sim, but look!  To add insult to injury, they've put a 'onlyallowrunincountries' lock on it in my region. That's all I needed to not buy anything from Egosoft ever again. 10/10			"

												Ok, I was really, really mad when this game came out because I was so damn excited about it. I had high expectations, because I LOVE the X series. I own every X game that exists (and about 5 or so other space sim games). Let me just say WOW, now that the game is working and running amazingly smoothly, 1 crash in over 20+ hours of gameplay, that may not even have been atrributed to thier game engine. The frame rate is awsome on my GTX 770 maxed everything.THE GOOD--------------------GRAPHICS: The grahics are next-gen for a space combat game, they are amazing and fun to watch every, single time. SPACE COMBAT:space combat is fun and the AI is better than most space sim games out there. It can get repetitive after a while doing nothing but combat for hours on end but you can just go do something else, build some stations, conquer sectors commanding your capital ships and just watching the battle from a commanders perspective. You can start a trading empire, or become a pirate and depoy remote detonation bombs on ships... it goes on and on.ENVIRONMENT:As a Uninty game engine developer, I'm pretty amazing at what you have achieved with scale in this game. At first I couldnt tell if some of those large scale objects (Planets,Shatterd Moons) in the background were part of the skybox. I am very impressed with how you scaled the game and made it look so good. Though I suspect some kind of trickery at work with your Shaders! You should let me borrow some ;)GAME PLAY:You can board ships and take them over. nothing new here BUT, the pods come out of your ship and attract to the target like an action scene in a sci space film. So far it has been fun to watch every single time. Im addicted to capturing enemy space ships at this point just to watch the pods fly out. (they could add some drilling and molten metal types of animations and particle effects to make them appear to drill into the surface). THE BAD:-The sound effects can get a little old, if we can add more varition of sound effects and voice overs for the expansion, that would make this game more imersive and truly make it the greatest space sim ever made. Also, they need to write a script to limit how often a voice over is played from a single character controller, since you tend to click on them repeadedly when shopping for better crew members or ammo for your ship. You hear the same person repeating themselves 2-3-4 times... its annoying!-`They should add the voice over limitor function to the ship as well to keep it from reapting based up what the condition was that produced the previous voice over sound effect.-I had to look stuff up on google alot to find keys because there are SO MANY controls, there are controls for your controls! The control edit needs a form input search element to search through available controls quickly! This will be extremely usefull and save alot of time for beginners! Most people will be customizing thier controls. I am using keyboard and mouse and hated the default layout. I went from bad to pro once I changed all of the key controls and practiced for a while.-If you run in between two colliders it will bounce your around until you clip through into the interior of a station or a ship. It has happen to me many times and had to retart because your cant clip out from the interior. You need to control the unrendered side of your verticies and add a program to remove the physics colliders from the non-rendered side.-Your ""bounce"" physics on colliders needs to be toned down, so that clipping is less likely.- Also sometimes ships in your fleet clip through objects and get stuck, then I believe your fleet will bug out if that ship is within its group. Your fleet wont travel through gates if a group member is stuck. Mabey I'm wrong but,I had a ship clipped in a station and my fleet would not travel through a jump gate within any time frame. It seems the bugs I have encountered are more or less related to kinks that need to be worked on in your physics engine. You guys are awsome though for what you have made with such a small team.I'm sorry that I was so mad, I did not realize the scope and the work that is needed to make a game like this until I actually became a game developer myself and learned c#. You guys should of justdelayed the game another year and avoided that mess and you would have made ALOT more money. Does'nt your CEO get that? Seriosly, that crap launch you pulled hurt your sales!If you like space sim, BUY this game. It does have a learning curve, but it is well worth it to experince the fleet combat and amazing visuals and to realize that when this is improved slightly, it willbe amoung the top space sim games ever made if not the best single player space sim every made.

												Note: I'm not counting bugs as apart of this review.Very upset to say, this game is not what I expected. Luckly I purchased this game at a much later date when it was being sold for 50% off. As much as I want to recommend a game that developers put a ton of time into, I just cannot do it with X rebirth.Here are the reasons why:1.) We'll start with the campaign; One thing I like about Syfi games is immersion. If you can make me feel like I'm in living breathing world with things to do at ever corner, you've done a good job. Now I must admit they almost had me but when I found out that NPC's in the game where not actually doing anything they're simply there for cosmetic purposes, that killed me.2.) Voice acting, simply put, if I wanted to go see or hear talentless actors, I'd watch Twilight. The voice acting is absolutly, (ABSOLUTLY) atrocious. Coupled with bad resolution NPC models which a player would easily see that they all look simlar to one another, like a universe with a obvious incest problem.    What I don't understand if you would go to the lengths to make the outer world beautiful, and unique. Why not apply that same work when you're inside the station walking around? Keep in mind AAA graphics is not the bread-and-butter of a game, but keeping graphics the consistant through out definitely helps.3.)  I've played the earlier installments of the 'X series' and enjoyed them very much, personally one of the things I enjoyed the most was being able to switch ships around for bigger and badder ones. Although piloting a ship is one-hundered times better in X Rebirth, you are limited to one ship. Many people will aurgue this, but point blank if you're going to compete with today's space sims this is a feature your game is going to need.The good:                1.) With all that said, the game does have it's good side. One, being piloting the ship and navagating through menus is awesome, takes some time to learn.                2.) The ""outer world"" (when you're flying in space, near station (ect...). Is beautiful! And very futuristic looking.               3.) The game does offer things to do being: Minging, Gas harvesting, Station building, Trading, and exploring.               4.) I'll give it to Egosoft, they know they fu(ked up. But are working to impove the games mechanics, and any game braking issues. Hopefully the game will have a birghter furture, we'll see.For sure this game is not worth the $49.99 it is currently being sold for, but it is worth the $25 or so bucks that I bought it for during the sale.

												X rebirth is in no way worth the amount of money I paid for it.  I found it complicated even for a novice game player.  The graphics were ok but the substace was lacking in the campaign.

												I have been playing the X series since X2:The ThreatThis game is best enjoyed without taking into account the previous X titles, as a standalone game, it provides a fantastic and fun space-shooter/empire-building simulator.As an X game it does fall flat as you are only able to pilot one (althought upgradable) ship, rather than dozens of options that were availle in the earlier series.With the recent 4.0 update it allows for a quicker method of casual play, giveing you the opportunity for a 30 minute mission run, rather than spending a good hour or so simply hunting for an acceptable mission you can open up the BBS system and choose within minutes.If you like space games, give it a whirl, play campaign first as it is just a glorified tutorial and then dive into an alternate start.

												I came to this game after having put 60+ hours plus into the X3 games and expansions. Loving X3 i was really excited about this landing.But i'm sorry to say this game is buggy and broken and not a patch on on the previous X games. Yeah its pretty to look at a glance but once you start spending time with it and looking in detail you see how broken it is.Capital ships phase straight through stations and now seem to fly faster than the smallest ships.After about 7 steps of the main storyline i came across a game breaking bug that means you can proceed any further.While still hand holding you through the basics the game asks you to buy a certain type of drone, after spending about an hour looking for someone who sells the certain drone, the game hasn't left you with enough cash to buy it and gives you no signs at all to go and make cash. You have to go and explore...Which wouldn't be too bad if the station explanations and exploration is impossible to get to grips with.This wasn't a one off, this happened several times, in the end i gave up.I tried this game on launch and 6 months after, after several patches... they haven't fixed it.If you want a deep space game with decent mechanics, stick to X3 and the expansions			"

												I've given up. Ego is usually really great about fixing their mistakes and rewarding patience. Not this time. Each ""fix"" brings with it a slew of even more tech problems and bugs, let alone expanding gameplay to the same standards that were expected.Edit: I still try to give the game a chance. This edit is as of 3.2. There are still many game breaking bugs; Ships caught in trade loops, random crashes, off and on framerate drops. While things slowly are getting better, I still do not recommend the game in its current state. Bugs aside, gameplay is long and laborious... running back and forth through boring as heck trade lanes. They did take the lane minigame out, but even at that, the lanes are full of other small ships that get bombard you and slow you down. While I do like some of the first-person elements added to it such as ship crews etc... they are poorly implemented such as still limiting you to the Skunk ship, and having only a few NPC models. It gets old very quickly.			"

												Good game, good plotline (sort of :/), good graphics (which my comp can process at around 30fps at lowest settings if i'm lucky.  Big engines are great! just one tiny problem though.   Actually two.1: ONLY ONE PLAYER OBTAINABLE AND PILOTABLE SHIPSeriously, and like we didn't know why the Skunk was a terrible ship in the first place.  This game is missing all the customization variety that was in the old X3 games like Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude.  2: NO PLANET LANDINGS OR WARZONESSeriously Egosoft?!  We wanted planet landings from X4, THIS IS X4, AND STILL NO PLANET COMBAT, LANDINGS, OR NOTHING!  Honestly, the closest you get to a planet base is a ""Inherit your own planet mod from the community workshop, and even that was subpar at best.  Haven't seen any Yaki or Pirates (okay maybe 1 or 2 pirates), or Paranid,  All i've ever come across are stoned teladi, drunk terrans, depressed Argon, and a few suicidal xenon ships.  It's great that they're bringing back the Kha'ak, I loved those guys, but what's the point when you're still missing upwards of 80% of the old great content in the first place?5/10  MASSIVE ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT, GET IT TOGETHER EGOSOFT!!!! +2/10 cause can go into space stations and pretend to have a shootout with a bunch of battle droids.-1/10 cause already impossible xenon ai ""is being strengthened"".  As if the X Universe didn't already have enough to worry about :'(  Now we'll have a bunch of trigger-happy drones hovering around Albion, lovely.Side not:  Devs, some of us have been secretly wanting you to add in some Kha'ak and Xenon pilot interaction menus, so we can tell them to their faces that they suck cahoonas!

It has been a long road, and the dedication these devs have showed in sticking with it and fixing the problems rather than just abandoning the project and moving on is something I will not forgot when considering future titles as well.

As of the current version, this game is fantastic. Some weird dialogue is about the only complaint I have; otherwise this game is a phenomenal space empire builder. Combat is solid and satisfying, graphics are lovely, the simulated economy models are astoundingly complex, and the variety of different play styles you can go forth with make the game a little bit different for everyone. The detailed encyclopedia is also very accessible and helpful for learning about the game world.I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a space game with a lot of depth.			"

												Horrible game. I enjoyed the prior x games, but this is the 'special' cousin. If you enjoyed trading, forget it here. In an effort to 'streamline' trading, they basically made the whole thing shockingly frustrating. Most of your time is spent flying only a few meters away from each station searching for the hidden docking points. You will realistically spend 5-10 minutes just circling each station to find it has nothing of value to offer. I spent hours looking for a single profitable trade and couldn't find it. Epic fail on the trading side of the game.All other aspects are just as broken. The system of highways makes you fly in predefined paths from one set of stations to another and forces you to play a really lame minigame that involves drafting other ships for added speed. If that even sounds interesting, think again. What it means is that travel generally consists of a low res view of the backside of some stupid civilian ship only meters off of yours.Oh and the voice acting in this game made me want to hurt myself.

I am dissapointed because I spend hours flying around waiting for trade ships to do their thing to continue the story in which this mission is about the 4th one in just to find out BOOM GLITCHED! Trade ships dont trade. Kind of a big deal when ""Trade"" is in the slogan of the game.Even if patched I will find it hard to believe that everything is fixed if I come across anything odd.So sad that I spent $50.00 on it			"

												As a space sim fan, I am very dissapointed in this game. I paid full price when it was first released and regret it to this day. Bugs and glitches galor, and Im trying to give it another chance now that the 2.0 patch is out. The learning curve is very high, so the people sticking with it are a bit more hard core, or gluttons for punishment. The game is pretty, but if you have played any of the previous X games, you will be dissapointed to learn that you are limited to one ship, an annoying copilot, bad voice acting, and some ugly NPC's when you have to encounter them. I dont know anybody who likes to pilot sim games with mouse and keyboard controls, but there is support for a 360 controller, which is ok at best. And if you have a decent flight stick, expect to spend a good amount of time remapping controls till you get it into a useful configuration.Sadly, there are no other current gen space sims on the market, though last I checked, you can get the X bundle of the previous games in this series for under $20. If that isnt good enough for you, its still a long wait for Elite: Dangerous and Star Citizen.			"

												Don't bother. Great visuals and attention to detail on exterior views is totatlly destroyed by horrendous bugs, and horrific design decisions and total lack of attention to mechanics, content, gameplay or voice acting.Even with the weekly patches coming out I've still not managed to complete the main plot as I keep running into show stopping bugs, daft AI behaviour and a total lack of information about what is happening where to whom leaving you scratching your head in the time-honoured question of ""Is that a bug or a feature?"". In this game is most likely to be the former, or simply not implemented or just plain missing.Once you've flow around and examined the gorgeous visuals in a universe that somehow manages to feel too small and too large at the same time the actual gameplay is repetitive, furstrating and basically boring.The best way to earn money isn't to fight, build or think, it's simply to turn on the primitive echo locator and collect containers. Six million credits in an hour isn't unusual, and considerably more lucrative than attempting to fight your way through the horrid trade interface.Conclusion: Don't bother. Buy X3: Terran Conflict or Albion Prelude instead.			"

												When I first heard of this and saw gameplay trailers I was so excited about this game. It was what I wanted to see.. Or so I thought.The game just is not as good as I had hoped, the missions (at the start anyways) do not explain what buttons to press for things such as docking and I needed to go into the controls config in the main menu to find them out.It is also terrible for fighting, you cannot judge your aim correctly and even during travel it can be an annoying experience..I wouldn't reccommend this game to anyone, it's just not good with the controls or dogfighting/ship battles. The idea, concept and potential of the game is great on paper, in practice it's highly underwelming.			"

I saw beyond the worried complaints of fellow forum goers and knew, KNEW, the company would steer us right.  I.  Was.  Wrong.  So very wrong.  This game is a rebirth.  It is nothing like the previous X games.  The core fundamentals that make the X games are absent in Rebirth.  Trading doesn't work.  Using other ships for trading/fighting/whatever, doesn't work.  The only that barely works is combat, which is one dimentional.  Selection of weapons is very limited.  This game should have never been released when it was.

												Remember all the amazingly cool features in the previous X games that made them unique, and well worth the long startup time and learning curve?If you don't, you should probably go play those.  They're still pretty great, especially with mods.Well, Rebirth basically took all of good parts of the previous games and threw them out.  It's trash.  Combat is completely generic.  The trading system has been completely gutted.  The menus barely even work, and are bogged down with annoying animation to transition between the pages (and there are SO many pages).  The follower ships that you're supposed to hire and order around?  Wothless interface for orders, and they mostly just bug out and sit there.  The first person portions of the game, walking around on your ship and on stations are not even remotely interesting and only serve to distract and annoy from the already terrible gameplay.Remember how previous titles focused on setting up automated production/trade routes for profit?  Nope gone.Also, you only get one ship.  Because someone at the developer thought that could possibly be a good idea...I don't know how.I really enjoy the previous titles in this franchise.  They were challenging and unique games that occupied a special niche in gaming for me, and nothing else has offered a economic space sim that was even close to as interesting.  I cannot express how disappointed I am in this waste of a game.  I'm not sure that I'd be willing to risk my money on future titles from this developers.  Previous games make it clear that they have some talent.  This game makes it clear that they don't really give a crap.This game is complete and utter garbage, there are better flash games out there.  I wouldn't pay $10 for it, much less the (completely insulting) $50 that they seem to think they can ask.			"

												As a huge fan of the X series, I hate giving this game a thumbs down. I really do. But it just doesn't feel like an X game. Gone is the series' trademark ability to pilot any ship you see. Sure, you can capture and give them orders, but it's not the same. Instead, you get the exciting ability to slowly explore stations that all look the same and collect worthless loot from unlocked containers that are apparently just lying around.  I admire Egosoft's loyalty to the game and I respect that they didn't just leave it to die, but they are just kicking a dead horse at this point. The game can be fun at times and it looks graphically amazing, but it just isn't an X game, and that's all that really matters in the end,			"

												Overall: I tried playing this game on release day, and it was very glitchy and buggy. However, now that the game has gone through several major updates and patches, it is a very good space sim. True, it isn't the same as X3: Reunion, Terran Conflict, and Albion Prelude was; but it now can stand its own ground. Give it a shot once it is on sale. And download all the popular Workshop mods.Pros: -Visuals are very spectacular -A ton of opportunities to make credits-Big selection of ship upgrades-Beautiful soundtrackCons:-Controls are not very friendly, takes time to get used to them-Managing fleets and individual ships is a mess in my opinion, can be fixed with mods-You are confined to one ship-Requires frequent game saves, a lot of game breaking glitches-Can't repair owned ships (I personally have no idea how to get them to repair, so I'd appreciate an explaination on how to do it).

												I have played 148 hours of this game since its release. I seriously gave it every effort that could be expected. I have tried various mods to fix the otherwise terrible game design. I have edited save file after save file. The unfortunate result is that I am burned out by the constant restarting and the lost challenge inherent in editing save files. I feel ripped off by EgoSoft. They fell prey to the same business/design choices that so many other games have, like SWG and SWTOR for instance.... dumb down the game to appeal to the greatest number of people, and so designed the game for xbox 360, then at some point decided to port it to PC instead. The X series has always been a unique game with a loyal, if small, following. They betrayed us. Its 2013, why would you release a DX9 game in 2013... oh yeah, xbox. Dont buy this game for several months. Wait until the modding community, the real developers of the post-release game, to make it what it should have been.			"

												TL:DR - Some game called X-Rebith sucked in 2013 and ruined my birthday. Suddenly, there's a different game in my list claiming to be X-Rebirth and it is really good.I knew my birthday in 2013 was going to be amazing. I knew this because X-Rebirth was going to come out the day after. I gingerly thanked everyone that wished me a Happy Birthday and kinda more or less glanced over any of the gifts, because the next day none of them would matter. I was going to be fully engulfed in X-Rebirth. 2013 was going to be the best birthday ever.Then it came out. I might have played with it for 12-20 hours. Trying to get past the bugs, the glitches, the missions that won't work and force a restart, the loss of SETA, and everything else that I felt as though I had lost from the previous versions of the game. My birthday... was destoryed. A year later I noticed that I had been given the first DLC since I was one of the inital purchases of this awful game, so I thought I'd give it another shot. Add in a few mods and I suddenly had a tolerable game. I didn't hate it, but I certainly didn't really like either. Things where progressing and I decided that I would continue to keep an eye on it.Then 4.0 Beta. A totally new game that keeps telling me that it is X-Rebirth, but this game is really really good. I've got quite a few hours in it now as you can see and this is only because of what they have done since the newest patches. Ignore the old reviews and read the ones for the DLC. This game is easily worth every single penny these days.			"

												As a whole there is a lot of depth in this game that cannot be denied. It is sad that developers decided to make so many gamebraking gameplay decisions that simply make the game so frustrating, slow progressing and difficult to access. There is almost no automation, so you can forget having a big corporation like in previous X games, the beggining of the game is just disapointment after disapointment when discovering that you cannot do that or that, and you have to do it manualy, slowly and be present in the zone where its going to happen. Without the option to accelerate time (which EGOSOFT said they will NOT add) i had to stare at my trade ship to dock at a station for 25 minutes, as thats how long it took to dock. In the mean time there was nothing else to do at all. So EGOSOFT says that time acceleration will not be needed in the game as you dont have to wait for your trade ships that much. Probably 25 minutes of docking is not considered as sufficient amount of time to wait before it starts to fall under ""need to wait"" category in EGOSOFT. Many gameplay features are simply not working alongside with the games concept. The interior is suprisingly passive and you basically cannot do anything in it, not even turn your head.To ""discover"" a new station in your zone, you need to be ridiciously close to it, we are talking about 500m for your computer to notice it. And than comes the weird duty of scanning the station, which means you need to come like 500m far from each module of that station, and not just anywhere on that module, on every module you have to find a specific spot that you need to get close to in order to scan it. So the whole scanning process of EVERY station will take about 10-30 minutes.What is that about? Isnt it in the stations interest to just tell me ""Hey we are selling this for this much, want some?""I have to go thru so much hassle to get to know what do they make, sell and for how much that its beyond believe. After that, the whole frustration process of trading starts that again is so ""un-independent"" that making even the simpliest trades takes player so much time... Egosoft, there are many gameplay decisions you chose to implement that i can live with, but you have broken the whole concept of X games into small pieces that each is very frustrating and doesnt really go one with another.I want more interactive cockpit, i want to click on a small button above the radar screen to change its modes, modes like :zone map, sektor map, selected object info, basic trading info for the zone etc.I want to turn my head in cockpitI dont want to go inside of the stations and search for needed engineer hoping there is some everytime i need oneI want to be able to communicate with the stations from outside, i shoud not need to dock at all if i dont need repairsI want to use more than one gun at the same timeWell yes i will say it. I want the game to be a lot more like the previous X games were. You said you will make it more user friendly but to me it is exact opposite, even when you know how to do stuff, it is pain to do it			"

												I've been reading and watching how bad reviews Rebirth has been given...However I had made a decission to buy it when it would be cheap enough, and the weekend deals -66% was enough.I loved the previous titles, to the extent of X taking over my life pretty much.In anycase, the expectations were low thanks to the reception Rebirth has earned and I do really understand the reasons for it.The control scheme is pretty much ruined; when things were fast and simple (map, property menu etc) in earlier titles, in Rebirth it's done slow and cumbersome. Everything looks like it were aimed at consoles, but on the other end... not.UI is not only complex, but it lacks any sense of purpose. Earlier it was just complex but almost everything was where it was for a reason; and it worked after getting used to it. 7 hours into the game and I still have constant issues with the UI, never finding anything and things have been done VERY complex compared to what it used to be.Story feels nice and for that alone I will keep on playing, hoping that one day I get over the hugely confusing stupid UI Egosoft has created for Rebirth. I heard that a year ago the game was utterly unplayable and that doesn't surprise me at the least; it has been like this for a long time for X-series... Game is more or less unplayable for the first year and then it starts to get where it should be.I only hope X:Rebirth isn't where it should be, since there is so many issues still (at least for someone like me, who has spent literally thousands of hours in the earlier titles) especially with the UI and the way everything works.Fighting is very difficult with autoaim set to off, using Saitek X52 Pro makes life hell - easier to play with a gamepad and everything works way more logically with that.All in all, not a TOTAL failure. Not worth the full money even after a year of developement and bug fixing or the DLC. Still I get a nice feeling flying around trying to go on with the plot and the game draws me back in, calling me to play more.A lot of work is still needed, but if anyone can do it - Egosoft can.Against my better judgement I *will* recommend this game for everyone who are enthusiaistic about X series or ""hardcore space sim's"", but those who are not one of the two groups mentioned should really try it out first to see if they like it.

												I played this game a long time ago when it was very bad.  I then moved on and bought elite dangerous which although technically brilliant as a sim it has no life and therefore no lastin interest.  Since the X-Rebirth has been patched it has come on in leaps and bounds to become the game it should have been. The only space combat sim that imo got the balance right was Freelancer which ofc is now barely limping along due to lack of support.Go for Elite Dangerous if you want a pure sapce flight sim (but thats all you'll get). This is the goto game if you want something with loads of depth and life.  The game draws you in and makes you feel like your part of it.  The art of a good game is to make you feel there.  This game finally does.  While your waiting for Star Citizen give this a go			"

												X Rebirth is broken, incomplete and dosen't even come close to the old X game's you only have one ship ( who is absurd strong) the Capital ship's don't have a shield and trading has become a hassle because of a very complicated system.For each and every trade you have to go onbouard a station ( witch get's old very quick) talk to exremely ugly peopleand then leave the station while hoping that no pirate destroy's your docked ship.your action's don't have any effect on the world and the story is boring and does not even have a proper ending.In fact, noting get's resolved in the story and most of the stuff dosen't make any sense at all.As a fan of the old X game's i'm very sad how this game turned out and don't recomend it to anyone, it's just a waste of money.

												So much fun! Barely scratched the surface and I still have dozens of systems to discover.[UPDATE] 200 hours later I'm still addicted to this game! I have discovered every system and visited every sector, but I have barely begun to know them. I honestly don't understand the bad reviews, but here are a few thoughts:1.- This is game is super complicated, which is something I very much like, hence the 230 hours!2.- Because the game was buggy at the beginning people think that some things are bugs, but you just need to figure them out e.g. you order a capital ship to buy something from somewhere, but it just sits there. Most likely it's either a) you're sending it to a sector or station you haven't discovered yet or b) very commonly, you're sending it to a station that, even though it advertises its products on the market, it doesn't actually have a trading port! I know that's complicated but I love it!3.- People don't like it because they compare it to previous iterations. Nothing to add here except I find this game much richer, prettier and deeper. You can literally do anything you want: become a bounty hunter, a taxi driver, a warlord, an imperialist, a business man, etc. You can eve get off the ship and walk-around the stations or even the back of your ship. It's not very useful, but it certainly adds immersion.If you do get this game I strongly recommend getting the Cheat Mod from the Workshop area, as this allows you to take over, not only over stations, but also claim whole sectors!

												I em enjoying this game. Much better than other space sims I've played. It is a different game than previous X games so if you're expecting the same as before you will be disapointed. That's probably why there are so many negative reviews, people's expectations are not met. But this game isn't trying to be just like previous X games. It's a whole new graphics engine and approach in general.Does it have some quirky moments? Yea sure. One look at the save file and you can know that there is a million different calculations going on in this game constantly... so I'm not surprised that ""occasionally"" things might get a little ""stuck"".You know what, deal with it! People aren't perfect and neither is Egosoft, give them a break. The game they first released certainly had many bugs but they have stayed with their game and addressed them. For the times it does get ""stuck"", it's usually just a matter of leaving the zone and coming back or reloading a previous save... done, that's all, no big deal.If you don't like space sims, or thinking, than you won't like this. There are mods to make things move a long much faster... play the game first and then read up on the mods so you understand what they really do and then get what is appropriate for your playstyle.The community for this game is awesome. People are always willling to help out and give guidance in the discussion boards. Like any game on Steam, I personally wait for  a sale, but this game is worth buying as long as you are willing to push through the learning curve... you tube, google search, and steam discussions are your friend.

												Egosoft, or rather the lead designer, apparently succumbed to their own arrogance and chose to ignore every bit of feedback from their loyal customers and chose instead to develop a mediocre arcade shooter.  I was alarmed when I read that there would be only one pilotable ship, but was assured that it would be wildly customizable.  They lied, there is virtually zero customization...  which primarily revolves around which of a half-dozen weapons to equip.They touted on-foot exploration as a groundbreaking feature where we could explore space stations and factories that actually had working machines producing physical goods using physical resources.  They lied...  there are ~4 layouts of space stations with a minimal amount of space to ""adventure"".  Hallways are blocked off via doors painted on walls and piles of janitorial refuse.  None of them appear to actually serve any real function, although one was obviously intended to be a jail.  I guess some genius figured that nobody would question why 1/4 of the space stations in the game used to be prisons.They got rid of the time acceleration feature, claiming that their usage of space highways would make the game faster.  Unfortunately it just means that your cargo ships now take hours of real time to get anywhere since they don't use the highways.  And you end up staring at the ♥♥♥ end of the 34th century's equivalent of a Honda Civic while traversing the wonders of space.This may be the most disappointed I have ever been by a game.			"

												Version 3.53 :Egosoft has finally made X Rebirth a proper X3 sequel!  Although X3 Terran Conflict (TC) and Albion Prelude (AP) are arguably better games for many reasons, X Rebirth is finally in a state that is worth playing.  It's not perfect – there are still many graphical issues, performance bottlenecks, and annoying restrictions that keep the game from being great, but it is worth 15 or 20 dollars if you find it on sale for that price.For fans of X3 and the series, it is worth coming back to and trying again.  I waited until 3.0 to get back into the game since its disappointing release.  It wasn't unexpected that release day would be problematic: There was plenty of evidence that this happened to prior games in the series and that Egosoft added many features post-release that should have been available on release day.  Still, despite how bad the game was when it came out, Egosoft has written the wrongs right.  I never had any doubt that they would get to 3.0.  But for those who are still bitter about the release: Their anger is justified, however, outdated.  X Rebirth has had a second rebirth.Why does this game now deserve your time?  It is probably the easiest X game in the series to get started with.  Unlike the other X games, the story/tutorial does explain most of what you need to know in the game(although the campaign gets frustrating at times).  Egosoft recently posted videos explaining advanced features that I would have never been able to figure out on my own.  The missions are also more friendly, giving you the ability to make money early without drudging through 50 hours of poverty trading energy cells.  The combat isn't the best part; and I find that exploration is lacking a bit as well.  So if those two features drew you to this game, get X3TC or AP instead.  This game highlights station building with an emphasis on building an empire as well as trading and building a fleet.  Station building is the only feature I can definitively say I like more than X3.  It is my personal favorite part of the X series, and it may be the reason I end up playing X Rebirth more than the 1000 hours I put into X3.If you are new to the X series, you may want to move on to X3 TC and AP if you're looking for more fun and more challenge after X Rebirth.  AP is also easier than TC, so that game may be a preferable next step.  I would recommend playing all these games with a joystick though.  I use a yoke myself, and I find that much more immersive.  You may also want to run the soundtrack for X Rebirth in the background -- it is absolutely awesome but half of the music doesn't seem to appear anywhere in the whole game.In the end, this game isn't worth 40 dollars.  It probably isn't even worth 30 unless you've already paid 300 bucks for a ship in Star Citizen.  I'd say buy it if it's under 25 if you're a space genre fan or empire builder.  This is just my opinion of course; I preordered the collector's edition.  I have no regrets though.  It was worth it for me.Note: The Teladi Outpost DLC is a small addition of content, probably worth 3 to 5 dollars.  It's nice to explore and build in a new region of space. My opinion and final thoughts: This huge game was made by a small developer, which inevitably means it's very rough around the edges. It's my opinion that most people who gave this game negative reviews think that it had a development team as large as Skyrim with a massive budget. I read many times about how X Rebirth (the game) was compared against Star Citizen (the idea), and somehow Star Citizen won almost every time. I find that line of thinking to be completely irrational. And I'm hard-pressed to find a game on steam that received lower ratings than X Rebirth (27% in 2014), even amongst games that were abandoned by their developers. X Rebirth seems to be the game that appeared at the wrong place and the wrong time.I nominated this game for the ""Test of Time"" award.			"

												Highest ranked positive review as of 2014-02-13, Is it that bad or that good!? ""Migiri migiri meg!"" -Signumix This is the best dating sim ever for trying to pick up grannies in space. You can yell things at them like, ""Show ME....YOUR wares!"" all seductive like. They then respond with phrases about pleasing you in anyway.After that, you can buy things from them.... awwww yeah. Giggidy, giggidy. Sometimes, you can hire them and keep them in the back of your ship. You can leave the cockpit anytime you want to go look at all them grannies you got. Instead of ""junk in the trunk,"" you got ""wrinkly in the skunk."" Also, Skunk is the name of your only ship you can fly.Build, Trade, War. All those features are not really bugged. People are thinking of build, trade, and war in the sense of a space sim game. Of course won't find those types of features working properly. This is a granny dating game!You're BUILDing a harem of old ladies. You TRADE wares that you find raiding old people smelling lockers in the space stations for them old ladies. You will even go to WAR to build your collection of old ladies. After you take a ship over and it's stuck there (again not a bug, but excellent design decision), just fill it with them grannies. They're bound to that ship and not going anywhere. Awwwwww yeah. Egosoft done did good on pleasing me.			"

												Honestly and Truly one of the worst, most disappointing game releases in my 20+ years of gaming. X Rebirth captured the imagination and excitement of fans of the X universe with its trailers promising a living world, explorable stations and so on...but the execution of the project killed the excitement of all but the most diehard of supporters within the first 15 minutes of gameplay upon release. Even now, many months later - the game is so riddled with issues that its a chore to play rather than a joy. All of the bugfixes in the world cannot change the fact that this game has terrible (AWFUL!) voice acting, a bland story line, transgendered old lady NPCs everywhere, and some serious dialogue issues. Why is everyone in this X Universe so damned polite? Even the pirates say lame things like ""I am going to get you"" and ""Surrender Please"". I think there was perhaps a language barrier issue (?) that translated to some very stale, overly polite and choppy dialogue...but that's something that has to be fixed in a game that really relies on dialogue to tell the player where to go, who to trade with etc. I cannot and will not recommend this game to anyone; outside of perhaps use in a game design classroom setting to show future developers what NOT to do. It doesnt matter how beautiful the space scenes are; a polished turd still stinks.			"

												Newer: EDIT!:I have since completed the campaign and it was a brutal grind at times (Most of the X games had that at some point). And I must say there are some systems in the game that once they have been fine tuned and you understand them completely its... pretty damned impressive compared to the earlier games. The automated trade system is absolutely lovely, manual trade was the one thing that always turned me into nothing but a hitman in the other X-Games as the combat was really the only rewarding thing. The boarding system is much more interactive and challenging however it can be very difficult to get going initially as marines are sold only as recruits and even with a decent commander they can still get wiped out in seconds of reaching the inside of a craft. Combat against larger targets is much more interesting as they have soft points that can get blown off individually (Turrets, Jump Drive, Engines). The new missle system is short but not very sweet, as they are very cookie cutter (3 different types for fighters, 3 different types for scouts/interceptors, 3 different types for capital ships and stations) also there is NO missle defense system, once the thing is launched there is no getting rid of it unless it hits you or self detonates due to range. Drones have had a huge overhaul, there are hacking drones, automated interceptor/defense drones, missle drones, and manual control combat drones.Crew: Yeah these actually exist now, mechanics, marine captains, captains, defense officers, architechs, pilots and they can all be trained and have thier own skills.The game its self is unique in its own way from its predecesors and it expands on its idea as its own and I dont think it should be compared to the other X-games because it is so different from them as there is no comparion really. However those crappy highways need to go away and they need to bring back the Singularity Engine Time Accelerator (SETA)If Egosoft did the following:Took Terran Conflict/Albion Prelude and put the many systems that X Rebirth had into games like that then they would indeed have a title well worth their time, X3TC/AP with automated trading, indepth combat/boarding, Crews, Automated Station Administration, Adaptive Drones and took the complexity and diversity of the Terran Conflict/Albion Prelude and that would be something I would gawk at.However the game its self doesn't stand very well on its own and its so mediocre that I still would skip it.Older :Do not buy this game for its current price it is NOT worth 50 Dollars. I have been a veteran of the X series since X2 The Threat and I have no idea what Egosoft was going for with this one =/The game is mostly just flair and flash and the content is... repetetive, limiting, small and not to mention the menus are absoultely tedious to deal with and half the hud gets in the way of its self. There is only one ship that you yourself can operate which is just bonkers from the last installment of the X universe. There is a lot of new systems and scripts along with the game being mostly automated in comparison to the old system but getting the hang of these new systems was overwhelming and really not worth my time and I am familiar with these games, I couldnt imagine someone new to the realm of X starting up on this installment.Normally I like to play a months worth or so of a game before I decide to review it but I just cannot play this game because I cant even get past the broken campaign. If they fix one storyline halting bug, there is another (I have run into two and after I finally got past one there was another I was stuck at and after the game crashed it corrupted my save and had to start all over and now cant get past the first bug). The game feels rushed and incomplete and I honestly think egosoft just flat out landed on their face on this one. I hope they completely scrap this, stop working on it and move onward because the storyline wasn't honestly interesting me at all and I LOVED all of the other stories up to this one.Buy at your own risk is all I can say.Don't give up on the series though, if you haven't already play the titles before this one and wait patiently for the next installment. Hopefully they listen to the community and get it together on the next one.""♥♥♥♥ Tyrone get it together!""			"

												I am so sad that I can't get a refund for this. The game was officially released but it wasn't even in Alpha condition. In addition to all the updates that have happened since release, it's still a load of garbage for the following reasons:- There is truly nothing to do but walk around cramped stations- Attempting to trade with stations is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever seen in my gaming career (you can't even tell if you're buying or selling)- Combat has no User Interface. You get a targetting reticle that stays on your screen and has no ability to lock on targets (and when you lead your shots, you still can't hit anything)- Trying to take over a capital ship? Forget it. Attempted that, couldn't even disable the ship's engines let alone comandeer it. It's bugged because all the ship's systems come right back to full and you never find out what happens to your marines.- Dialogue is garbage- Interface overall is cumbersome, you ACTUALLY TURN in your chair when you open a window by accident, completely blinding you even while in a fight. And the kicker:YOU""RE STUCK IN ONE SHIP FOREVER! That's right, unlike every other game made by Egosoft, you're stuck in your single space ship that is big enough to be a pain to fly, small enough to be ineffective in a fight.But wait! That's not all! Act now and you can get free crashes to your desktop after every save. And when you come back and try to load game? You guessed it! The save is deleted!			"

												""None of your friends have played this game recently. Tell them why they should."" - You shouldn't. I wouldn't recommend this game to my enemies let alone my friends.  Apparently my review can only be put into 4,034 characters. This isn't enough room to tell you everything wrong with this game. Until Steam can actually impliement a system that isn't limited, my review can't be posted. Needless to say this is without a shadow of a doubt the worst game ever released by Egosoft.			"

												If you love Blade Runner and you love Space, you must get this. Seriously even if you never engage in the actual gameplay, the aesthetics and vibe of X:Rebirth is so strong with a good space version of Blade Runner. For flying around in space and exploring, checking out the intense detail of the stations and listening to the encyclopedia entries of every module of every station, this game delivers.Something that separates this from most space games? There is consumer traffic flying around constantly (not just other fighter ships, but civilians driving regular space cars and vans on space roads and highways. This adds a huge amount of atmosphere to the game that is missing from other space games. The ambient AI always moving around while you observe the beauty of this living breathing space environment.Second thing that separates it? Easy and good feeling mouse control. At night I play this on a freaking laptop trackpad okay? And the fact that I can do that is awesome. Most space games require something more demanding, some don't play well at all without a controller or joystick. There is some wonkyness to X Rebirth - the first person bits in particular and they could really improve some of the dialogue with NPCs, I don't hate it but it has the potential to be much better. However not many space games manage to have first person control at all, so I am very forgiving here. There is also something very cool about looking off the balcony of a station in first person and seeing how large and cool the stations around you look from ground view. It is a welcome change of pace to have your feet on the ground when you need a rest from constantly flying around.Egosoft has made an admirable attempt at restoring the general quality of this game to where it should be, and at version 4.0 it's in a very good spot. They have made some very meaningful updates and a lot of them make it easier to get into the game in general. Just be aware that you will only be flying one ship, unlike the X3 series. However the environments are so awesome that I was also able to forgive this.X Rebirth is a very ambitious game, and with that comes some rough edges. But after these patches it's not so rough anymore, and for what they achieved with the vibe and detail of environments / stations alone, you have gotten what you paid for. The Teladi Outpost and Home of Light are recommended to expand the universe further! Have fun space fans!			"

												New review with 2.0...I restarted the game, they (finally) removed the highway stuck on people mini-game.Other than that, the game is the same, just a load less buggy. The icons of enemy ships and loot is still to small to see, there still is the boobs mini game... the stations still need to be identified (which takes hours), and the game is still 4 sectors big. Did not see new weapons.There are a few new starts, the new cockpits don't block the view as much as the old ones.Be back later if I find the courage to try the game more...Below: the previous reviewI don't usually write of reviews, but... this game has disappointed me so much.Ok first: the history. This game is the ""latest"" from Egosoft, which had somewhat of a cult following by a growing community based on the X-Universe. Concept evolved a bit. At the start, you could manage only a single ship, and over the diverse iterations the game had, you could control the entire universe, pilot anything you could see in the game, board other ships, force other pilots to leave theirs so you could add them to your fleet. You could build ships, weapons, shields, food, manage the economy of the entire game... or not, if you wanted to. This was a plain good example of a sandbox.Not that the game was any way near perfect. From what I've seen, there was little changes in the core ""code"" and the multiple possibilities added in the game over a period of more than a dozen year were added as time went by. Also, core ""concepts"" of the game remained broken, like trading, like the awful amount of submenus you had to go through for simple actions, like the amount of micro needed to manage a semi-decent sized fleet, like the awful tutorials (few games have tutorials that players complain of not even being able to start), and pathetic ""early"" game hell (your starting ships usually are the ones needing the most skills to pilot, a choice a load of people found dubious at best - even then, there is a load of things that need to be learned for the game to work and the game barely explains any of it). Some sell this as ""good game with harsh learning curve"", but it's not really learning when the game expects you to know things it does not tell you. It did get a little better with the latest iterations of the game. The game was still harsh and unforgiving, but you actually could manage somewhat.The community was very active, modders changed and influenced the game, as with the concept of scripting nearly everything open to them, it was very much possible to rewrite most of the universe, ships, weapons, trading and so on...What did players want for this last edition ?Simply a rework of the engine making the game more intuitive. More beautiful graphics. An expanded universe. A decent UI. Some other ""simple"" stuff.What did they get ?(Note that I'm voluntarily ignoring the fact I spent half of my ""playing time"" editing xml, and other bugs.)They got a game with less possibilities on all aspects of the game. The starting ship cannot be switched and can irrealitiscally take on the whole universe with ease. Your fleet (you can remote control other ships) currently can barely be controlled and built, but the interface for doing so is actually WORSE than before. Before, you had to move through half a dozen text sub-menus to do a simple task. Now, it's half a dozen subscreens. Your own movement : before, it was slow, painfully slow of most ships with decent firepower, but you could alleviate this somewhat by jumping around from a sector to the other side of the universe. This is not possible anymore (jumping) without lengthy micromanagement, but the ship isn't faster as a result, making the game even slower than before. Building stations was cumbersome and annoying, but with mods you could somewhat do something. Now, it's just painfully long, cumbersome, annoying, and more expensive than ever.About the mini-games, like tailing other ships to speed on lanes... except half of the sectors in the game have no ships in them, so painfully slow at its finest. Another mini-game, each time you put on a subscreen, your copilot (which no one ever asked for) flashes her boobs at you... Bad taste at its finest, again. Yes, that's the minigame. I think. Well. Dunno. I suppose, it's written ""trade"" on one of the boob screens. The ""conversation"" minigame, which figures random (and therefore useless) rewards when you have a specific need. The ""find people to pilot ship / station / build station / pilot fighter / repair systems / board ship"" mini-game, which is the most time-consuming problem ever. If you fight a fleet with a cap ship and 3 fighters, and manage to board the cap ship and capture 2 fighters, you need to have 2 pilots (fighters), 1 captain (for the cap ship), 1 engineer (to repair the cap ship, otherwise you can capture it but it won't move), 1 marine officer (to start the boarding action). Except you have only 4 places in your ship. If you were doing anything like transporting a specialist to a station, finding an architect to build a station, you have even less places to use. Point is, you usually have to go though 2-3 stations and systems to get one guy...This game was marketed as a ""X-universe"" game until about a day or so after it got released, after that, the community was told that this was not supposed to be a ""rebirth"" of the previous game, but another game. However: even forgetting all that you could do earlier and cannot do here, the game is STILL bad enough that you want to run away from it. Funny enough, a game in the same universe, with the same naming schtick, with the same motto, and named ""rebirth"" is supposed to be a completely different game. To illustrate, the guys from Egosoft are like trying to market Diablo 3 as a game which is not a Diablo-like. Except, they're not marketing diablo 3, they're trying to market a cheaply made copy of diablo 1 with good graphics.Egosoft does have some history about cleaning up their own mistakes, but here, problem seems to be that the main designer of the company does not seem to have a clue of why his game was ""successful"" in the first place, that they still did not hire an ergonomist (or maybe they've got an incompetent one, who knows ?), that their marketing service does not understand anything about the concept of ""public image"", and that they still have no quality checks for bugs in the game (that's been for a dozen years).Maybe when the company changes enough so this game series gets all this, I'll buy X-Rebirth 3.

												I really gave this game a lot of leeway.  I'm a software engineer myself; I know how much it takes to make good software.  I loved X3: Terran Conflict.  There might not be a single game I've played for more hours, and I'll have to admit that even that was severely flawed.The UI in this game is horrendous.  The AI is missing.  It's terribly unbalanced.  There is very little actual content.  The performance is terrible (even on the lowest graphic settings).  And the bugs ... call Orkin.All they had to do was make X3 with a better UI, fleet management, and (if they really insisted) the ability to walk around inside of stations.  Instead, they made this mess.  I wanted to like it.  I gave it a good try (and $50), and I just can't take it.  I've been scouring the internet trying to find ways to make the game fun, playable.  There's just no hope.  Maybe by next year they'll have something good.  I'll check back then.			"

												Ive been a long time fan of the X-series games, and have stuck with them through many years of bugs, fixes and patches. This game though, seems different. Its not an X game, its a console game. To clarify that, it feels like a failed console game, that was pushed over to PC because there was a market there. It is not of good quality, and certainly not Fit for use. Admitedly, it has got better over time, but not enough for me to justify the money I spent on it. I did learn a valuable lesson from it , which was never , ever again pre orer any game. The hype was amazing, and the spin that Egosoft put on it, made it look incredible. Well its not. Im sure it may be good in time, but its not something i could recommend to other gamers. Save your money and head over to Frontier Development, and check out Elite Dangerous. now THAT is Amazing and then some !!!			"

												The 4+ hours I spent on this are maybe the most wasted hours I ever has spent in any game I have played the last 30 years. It is actually very sad that this promissing title crashes as it does all over the review board. It became apparent early on that this game did not resemble previous X-games in any way other that it was space based. To top it off the game is full of strange design decisions like looting boxes and air vents for useless trinkets. No auto pilot, radar or an understandable map.I did not encounter any bugs, but then again I hardly got as far as just starting the first trade. The game is riddled with bugs, even now after several patches if you are to believe the postings on the forum.Egosoft aimed for simple, but hit dumbed down. You have to tell your Captain on your tradeship where to trade. Odd, didn't I hire the capatain to run the ship for me? Why should I then have to baby sit him and do the actual job for him?To be honest, as it appears, this game is hardly the shadow of its predecessors. Stay away.  "

												Lets get 1 thing out of the way before i begin, i know a lot of people are disappointed that you cant personally use more than 1 ship. yes it stinks but this game was never designed to be that kinda game, so rating it as such is abit unfair, if you didn't keep up with the press pre-development and didn't know this, then that's your own fault.So lets get started with my short review.Egosoft has a Long History of Releasing games that simply don't work on launch, they have MASSIVE potential but they don't work on launch... THAT SAID, they also have a long history of sticking with their products post launch to fix all of the launch bugs, add content, and add community feedback to the game in order to make it amazing.You will never see me fanboy for or back up any other developers, because they simply haven't earned it. Other devs always disappoint and never do for their games, what will Egosoft does for it's games.Egosoft is one of the rare devs that shouldn't get rated for their games on launch, to be fair YES it deserved the bad score then, but all of the newer players don't know what us older fans do, and that's that ego doesn't abandon its products. if we wait patiently, a year or 2 later we will have an amazing game to play. Don't believe me? Just look at the new reviews, they are positive!I highly recommend anyone who gave this game a negative review in the past, reinstall this game and take a 2nd look around at all the new stuff that has been added. Their are also a number of really good mods to try. Personally i have a lot of mods and have a very customized immersive and enjoyable experience each time i login. TLDR? Next time you buy a Egosoft game do so in good faith.Install it, don't play it, wait a year for them to patch the problems its guaranteed to have on launch, then come back and play. It will be everything you hoped for and more! They are a very small studio and it takes time to make a good game.Also after you have beat the game, dont be afraid to come back from time to time and try it again. Egosoft has a wonderful habit of adding new things to their games after post launch, and all through out its life for years after.			"

												Terrible game. I'm a huge fan of the X3 series but this game is nothing like them. The map system is restrictive and confusing. The idea that you have to fly around little icons all over a station before getting the best opportunities gets pretty irritating. I spend 3 hours trying to make one cargo ship comple a trade in a tutorial mission and it just wouldn't do it.The in-station sections look like they were designed for the nintendo 64. Poor character animations, and you are encouraged to steal anything that isn't nailed down right in front of people that don't even care. I wasted 5 hours and too much money on this piece of garbage.			"

												Nice try egosoft, the only thing you forgot to do before releasing the game is to fix the hundreds of bugs there are in the game. its been a while since the game was released and it is still full of bugs. During 4 hours of actual gameplay, you have to think that you have to add 2 hours of waiting because of the multiple bugs there are in the game!! You target spawn inside a station so you cant kill it, your capital ships wont go to a refueling station, you cant cancel trades and all the things that will make you enjoy waiting for hours. But when you think you finished waiting, another bug appears and you have to wait another hour!!!Also, some feature of the game are hidden! And by hidden I mean core features that you dont know how to access! Even some of them are missing, for example, you cant cancel a trade! But why would you cancel a trade? Because of a bug that make your capital ship stand there, watch cartoons during 9000 years and when you ask him again, he look at you, and go back to his cartoons.So if you want to buy this game, wait a year, that way youll be sure (or not!) there are no more bugs! (Seriously, its a nice game, but its impossible to play it)			"

												After 105 hours of play time over 2 months and 24 patches later, this game is not worth the money.  There are still game breaking bugs and crashes.  Build cues lock up, traders stop trading still.  The game has no immersion value at all.  If you are serious about getting the game wait two more years. The devs might have it playable by then.			"

It should never have been released, and I'm truly kicking myself for paying £40 for a broken game.We need a law to prevent this kind of thing from happening.

												X Rebirth belongs with other storied titles such as Big Rigs Over the Road Racing and Ride to Hell: Road to Retribution. The scale of its failures are best described as ""Duke Nukem esque"" if you're a fan of space games and ""I can't believe that cost 49.99"" if you're not. There is nothing redeeming about this game except the exterior visuals of ships and stations, and they are nowhere near $50 good.			"

												Ok so 2.0 is out and there are have been a few improvements made to gamepley, controls and graphics stability since the last review. The game no longer crashes every 5 minutes and the graphics seem much smoother noteably when moving through densly populated areas, the controls are much the same but don't seem as jerky as before. I would still wait for Star Citizen of you're looking for a really involved space sim experience buecause this isn't it, it may do to fill in time if the price drops below £10. I worked hard to love this game but came up short and then just gave up. It still isn't the high quality involving game that it was supposed to be and I fall just short of demanding a refund. The stations throughout the game are based each on once of 3 layouts! That's it once you've seen all three you've seen all of them and you may as well get the mod that allows you to avoid going into the stations like X3 series stations. The voice acting is naff, the storyline is rubbish and the dog fights if approached correctly are a doddle so where's the challange? Where's the fun? Dissapointing to say the least.4.5/10Update:The new update 2.5 is a greay improvement and really shows what a comapany can do when they realise that they have released a sub par product to win customers back, the game is much smoother and edits to the travel system have made this game a little less boring. It's a step in the right direction and with the release of 3.0 due in dec/jan this game shows a real promise of being well worth a sale purchase to waste a few hours on.			"

												The game is in a pretty bad state right now, but Egosoft has a decent track record for massively improving their games after release. Don't get it now and check back in a couple of months.EDIT 11/4/2014:5 Months after release and the game is still a bug-ridden mess, just avoid this and get X3:AP instead.Edit 23/4/2014:Patch 1.30 hit and its improved joystick controls just barely make the game enjoyable but I did end up spending some time with it, so after ~20 hours of actually being able to somewhat experience the game I can finally write out some proper thoughts on the game.Clunky, very clunky. There's no easy way to go about anything.Want to setup a trade information network? While in X3 you'd send a ship to automatically deploy satellites in every sector, in Rebirth you have to dock with every single station, walk around until you stumble into a NPC that you can ""small talk"" with, play a silly minigame and sit trough cringe worthy dialog and then hope that NPC can actually update trade offers. Trading itself is also an issue. Unlike X3 you can only order trade ships around via a special trading interface that lists all trade offers and allows you to queue up trades. The idea is nice but the execution is very lacking, the UI, again, is very clunky: slow, badly designed and lacks the hotkeys that even X3 had. Even if you get past the UI you'll find your ships stuck more often than not, requiring yet more painstaking minutes in the UI to cycle them in and out of your squad and re-assigning all trade orders.Unlike X3's simple 1 cargo bay + maximum ware size system Rebirth has gone with, err, a total mess. Trading ships can carry a single cargo type (bulk,container,liquid,energy), plus a separate fuel tank, plus a separate drone bay. That, again, doesn't sound to bad in theory but now consider you can't just directly transfer wares between ships, unlike in X3. Ships can only buy jump fuel for themselves, if a ship finds itself in a sector without a station that sells energy sells (I wouldn't even know how that station is called) its stuck. In my X3 save I had a ship parked around the center of the galaxy that I could quickly order to refuel any ship that couldn't jump any further, nothing like that is possible in Rebirth. If a ship runs out of drones you need to take it to a shipyard, go out of your ship, search for the ship dealer, hope you found the right one (there's no easy way to tell what classes a ship dealer trades in) and restock it via drones via a special menu option(again, doesn't participate in the economy). Ships can't just go and buy drones for themselves (only for trading). The skunk is a story apart, there's a special ""inventory"" type for loot your collect from ships and scavenge from people's locker. These wares can only be sold to traders on stations and don't contribute to the economy or really add anything to the game. The skunk is also the only ship in the universe that can dock with stations and capital ships, fire missiles, strafe and is the only non-capital ship that can boost, carry people or launch half the selection of drones, it even gets its own special weapons that nobody else every seems to acquire.Upgrades to the skunk are also bought at special vendors that don't participate in the economy at all, and no AI will buy them.The player really is a story apart from the rest of the universe, nobody else behaves like you do, nobody else gets the abilities you have, a shameful departure from the X style of doing things.Ships and stations in Rebirth are no longer run by AI, instead they are crewed by people that you need to hire and transport around. Nice idea, bad execution. This basically adds a layer of complexity that isn't necessary and just isn't fun. I feel like I'm running a taxi service for an empire instead of managing it. X3 had all these ship upgrades that allowed you to over time delegate tasks to ships, Rebirth just plain doesn't. You'll always be the empire janitor/taxi instead of the manager you were in previous X games.Finding people to work your empire is again, very clunky. You can ask other ships directions to a specific person (again, trough a very clunky UI), but you still need to dock, walk around for a minute and hope the person you found actually wants to work for you.The economy and general game balance is just broken.I spend 90% of my time fighting a slow economy with trade ships stuck half of the time and earned ~1mil. Then I invested 500k in boarding, boarded a ship and sold it for 10mil. I used that to upgrade my ship completely and get a great boarding crew. Boarded another ship, sold that and now I'm sitting on 30mil, bored, slightly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and writing this review.Combat is generally boring, there's only 5 weapons for the skunk, 3 capital ship weapons (surface elements) and 4 missiles. Plus you'll end up fighting the same type of drone 90% of the time. (Still more interesting than trade, sadly). Boarding has been made much more accessible, but the rewards are game-breaking high.A good bit: The atmosphereThe music and graphics are still quite the thing and are sadly the most enjoyable part of Rebirth as of right now. I'd have more fun calmly exploring the universe, listening to the amazing soundtrack and taking in the sights and not worry about the disaster of UI, ship control or being a taxi service.I'm no great writer but I really love the X series hope this review has helped other fans of the series make their mind up about this game.TL;DR:Clunky, lonely, player is not part of the universe.Trade: You'll always be the empire janitor/taxi instead of the manager you were in previous X games.Fight: 5 skunk weapons, 3 capital ship weapons, 4 missiles, same enemy 90% of the timeBuild: Only in certain spots, limited in number, no self sustaining chains, little control.Think: see trade			"

												Half baked game. Unfortunatly this game was not ready for release and the gameplay is nowhere near as deep as the previous game in the sieries.

												It's like a jack in the box. You never know when the next crash or bug will hit.

												Overall this game in its current state is worth every cent. There are problems stemming from insufficient quality control and play testing but you can still get many hours of joy out of this game despite the problems.However, if you are a X2 or X3 fan, then be warned that this is not X4 rather its a continuation of the game style in the original X game, 'Beyond the Frontier'. Notably you can only fly a single ship although it is a very capable ship.Pro: Good space combat: Not Excellent like 'Freespace' but you get to target surface components of capital ships while dodging turret fire and thinking tactically about avoiding the turrets field of fire, flying faster than its tracking speed and avoiding head on conflicts with some deadly turrets that are near impossible to dodge. Economy: Empire building is generally enjoyable in this game, just be smart about location. Space station building is much more complex in this X game compared to previous X game, now you have to worry about hiring the right people to work on your station and building extensions. Story: I found the story to be enjoyable, you get to explore (within the campaign) and help the underdogs survive and grow. Space Terrain: Space is no longer a big empty void, plenty of asteroids, derelicts, space clouds and highways to give you a tactical advantage (if you know how) Good musicCon: Steep learning curve, lack of cue's, sadistic mission design occasionally: Sometimes you find that the game drops you in the deep-end or leaves you hanging from a cliff and you have to start googling to figure out how to proceed. For example, the campaign requires you to build a space station but it turns out that you cannot buy some of the prerequisite items. After some googling you find out that you have to become a pirate and steal said item but then you find out that you have to do a borderline sadistic amount of grinding to get enough of said item to proceed.Another example is that the campaign gives you a powerful war ship but doesnt tell you how to repair or move it, even after some googling you may still have trouble moving it.Another example is how larger ships move, the game gives you a capital ship but doesnt teach you about the jump fuel and capital ship booster dynamics, leaving you with some unnecessary confusion.Another example is the way station building works, you have to buy a construction ship which builds the station. You might think that the construction ship can then build another station once its done, but no, the construction ship becomes a permanent part of the station that can only upgrade said station, the game doesnt explain this mechanic. Cumbersome interface: They made some improvements with the updates but it is still unpleasant to use. Questionable script quality: Sometimes you find that things dont work as expected, often there is a good but obscure reason for it (are your ships lacking some drones? drone bay destroyed? drifted too far from station? etc) other times you find that it appears to be a bug, cancel the previous order and remake same order then it works. Some incomplete aspects: For example first person mode is quite limited and should be further expanded. Exploration also very limited, although the game does not claim to have a strong exploration element, it would still be an enjoyable addition, currently it is limited to finding some containers in space which are rarely useful and never interesting. Fighters cannot dock on capital ships, not even on carriers, only combat drones can dock. This makes me think that carriers are incomplete. Your stations can get damaged by trading: The exhaust fumes from a capital ship can damage ships and stations. In practice capital ships trading with stations accidently hurt your stations in this way. Then repairing your own stations is troublesome because you need to physically move the repair wares onto your station attached construction ships, they cannot put buy orders for these items on the market. Enemy stations cannot be completely destroyed, they will eventually rebuild. Most characters lack hair geometry. Also there are a lot of grannies in the game but that may not bother everyone :) "

												Downright unplayable. If this was released as ""early access"" it would be understandable, but they have essentially launched a game in beta (or even alpha) state and are hastily patching it. They spent a lot of time and effort on features that nobody wanted, walking around in stations, having a companion, talking to NPCs, etc. It feels like they played Mass Effect and tried to put what they saw into an X game, but failed miserably.But remember that X3 was barely playable when it came out. Egosoft does have a history of launching broken games, but with great post-release support. There is already a good modding community that are working on fixing this broken game. I would suggest passing on this until at least a year has passed, and possibly when they come up with an expansion (X Rebirth: The Rebirth).			"

												I'm rewriting my review after a year of this game being out.  I'm also going to consider it from a stand alone point of view.  This is only an X game from a story line point of view, it does not hold anything else in common with the preceding X games.As a whole, the game is free from major bugs, expecially the plot breaking ones.  The biggest problems I have with the game, is that for a game set in space, the areas are both cramped and to expansive at the same time.  The massive stations, while full of detail, can really become a hinderance while fighting near them as there is no reprecussions for the ai if they accidentally shoot them, but as the player, if you shoot the station or some of the civillians running around, you get reported to the police, have a standing drop, and if this isnt' your first time, get to have some of the police joining the fight against you.  These stations aren't so far apart that it takes long to get to them, but finding your way around them to a specific docking port can take a while if you don't have something to lead you to where it is.  This has been helped alot now though with the ability to gain access to all of the people on the station from near one of the dock ports.  You can also trade and recruit without landing on the station, with a slight delivery fee.  The stations themselves, while each type being very detailed and different, are rather limited in numbers.  Station interiors and NPCs also fall victim to this.  There are only about as many interiors as there are types of docks.  While each one is changed slightly, it's kinda like just rearranging a house without changing the base layout, there's only so much you can do.  The NPCs are all very generic, detailed, but ugly people generally.  This type of situation is the standard for the game.  Excellent detail on the individual parts, but so few parts, they repeated to many times.  Your ship, the Pride of Albion(aka Albion  Skunk as the designers decided to name your ship without giving you a chance to rename it to something worthy of a leader's ship)  Falls vicitim to this detailed mototony again.  Your primary weapons, a variety of lasers, are all able to be equipped to the ship simultiously, though you may only use one at a time.  As your experience, and cash, goes up, you are able to purchase upgraded versions of these, but they are nothing more than more powerful versions of the basics.  The missile selection is a little more diverse, mainly attributed to  the latest patches, with a good selection to suit most suations.  The engines and shields are also limited in selection with an average version, then one version at each extreme.  3 ""types"" of engines/shields, and increasing levels of them.    Your ""copilot"" is probably one of the worst parts of the ship, she is repetitive, annoying and the choice of outfit just doesn't fit into the game.  While that's not usually an issue, it really does bug me for some reason, considering the amount of time she ends up on your screen. I'm all for hot space women with very little left to the imagination, but this one doesn't fit into that in any way, and the ""boob window"" as it is called, just annoys me.Basic ship to ship combat is very standard, run of the mill.  Captial ships are large lumbering and pretty much push overs.  While they do support good shielding and hull hp, they only take time and very little effort to take down.  They have plenty of blind spots to hide in and recharge your shields while being pretty much invulerable.  One good example of this is the drone bays.  Wide open bays you can park your ship in, with no real way for the enemy to attack you.  Once you have recharged, you can pop back out and start taking out the turrets again.  They are very slow, and while they can jump from area to area, they are hard to manage on a large scale.   Trading with them tends to be tedious.  I do like the transportation system, aka highways.  they give you a nice view of systems,  balanced transit times, and are fairly well laid out, though it can take a while to memorize the network.  The improved maps in the latest patches have made finding your way around them easier, but I still think there is room for improvement on this aspect.  The missions and storyline are the one thing that really hasn't changed from the older X games or many other space games.  There are a couple set basic types of missions, and they are varied in difficulty by time, number of enemies, and such.  The biggest issue with the missions is that you have to wander around the massive stations looking for the icon to pop up,  there is no central place to find them, and you can sometimes take longer finding a mission than it takes to complete it.   I do like the story line and it fits well into the X universe and it's history.  The acting leave something to be desired of but on a whole, I do like this aspect.The final part of this game that I'm going to cover is the sandbox.  Whether you start from the end of the story line or a custom start, this in my opinion, is where the game is most lacking.  I have found it hard to set goals that keep me playing the game.  Your ship is fairly limited in upgrades, so combat can quickly become monotanous, though boarding and capturing ships has become increasingly difficult with the latest patches.  Building stations is also a long and tedious process with very little return on investment, as well as the same thing with trading.  The main problem I have with all of this is that once you limit out your ship, the only reason you need any money is to restock your missiles, or build more stations and capitals.  Yes you can use it to fund large combat squadrons, and go around wiping out whole stations and zones, but since you can't seem to takeover/rebuild the stations, you are eventually shooting yourself in the foot trade wise.  This game just does not have the variations in the right areas to be able to set large, diverse goals that can keep you playing the game for extended periods of time.  In review, as a whole, this game has a large attention to detail in what it has in it, but there is just not enough general content.   The story is a bit of a grind at times, but worth completing I believe.  All in all though it is a pretty average game these days,  Excellent detail, severe lack of content.  On a positive note though, unlike a lot of the good indy space games that are out, this game has an attention to layout that prevents the confusion that many of this genre suffer from.  There are a lot of other games, that while they are much more diverse and open ended, suffer from a pieced together user interface that is cumbersome and hard to understand. This game is sleek well designed and easy on the eyes.One more section to this review. If you have played any of the prior X games, do not go into this game with any expecations of it being like the rest.  You have been restricted to one ship, one race, even though there are 2 other races floating around, and a very limited selection of support ships.  From this aspect, they took the massive amount of content that the other games had, and removed it to provide high detail on a limited amount of content.  If they were to create DLCs that are X Rebirths for each race, and added them to the current standing game, not on their own indivitually, this game could eventually get much closer to the feel and playability of the original games, but I really don't see that happening.

I have not tried the latest patch but i really dont have the patience to restart the game everytime theres a patch. Avoid this one, theres far better games out there.Edit : retried the game 2 years later....I have an i5 4670k and a 780 gtx, which is far better than the recomened specs. Frame rates vary but i seen the odd drop down to 20 fps. In busy places i get 40-45 fps on low settings, higher settings am averaging just over 30. Walking about in stations is bad, i often get 25 - 20 fps depending where i am. . It is better than when it first launched but fps is still bad and after two years of development they still havnt completly fixed the fps problem. I dont know what the fps will be using the minimum or recommened specs. Textures are still bad, audio is out of sync in places, no effort to add hair to characters. The game its self is ok, there is alot to like about it, if you can look past the issues it has but personally i find it hard to.			"

												I had high hopes for this game. Sadly it has failed on so many levels its almost unforgivable. The UI design feels like it was an afterthought and the cockpit view is fixed with no freeview, To quote a recent review ""a 90's flight sim has better cockpit controles"" -destructoid.comI have given this game several chances but have been plagued by bugs. The latest trying to hire a defence officer, after alt tabing out to work out what i was doing wrong i desovared that the officer was already working for the station. That info nugget was hidden in a dev blog. How can you leave such an important piece of information from the game! after working that out i tryed to jump back into the game only to have it crash.That's really the last straw. Don't waste your time or money on this game, it looks pretty but thats where the fun ends. "

												Buggy basterdized wanna-be console space shooter.  UI is gutted and nearly unuseable in order to fit on an xbox controller.DEVs!  Consoles are good at sports and 3d action games.  They *suck* at huge complex sandbox games.  Quit trying to shoe-horn them onto consoles in order to sell to the frat-boy crowd.			"

												This game has come a long way since launch, and I am happy to say that it is, after many many patches, finally the game it should have been at launch. I am enjoying it now, but it was a pretty rough ride for the first year. I am happy to know they are still adding content and there is a new expansion coming soon in early 2016. For their commitment and transparency to their community, and their dedication to making rebirth great and never giving up, I give them a thumbs up and can now happily recommend the game.			"

												Terrible launch, now it's playable. However, it differs greatly from previous X-Experiences, which, by me, is completely fine. People tend to forget the hours of flying through systems for no reason and the tedious ""waiting for money""-game, as automated traders do all the work.All in all it's a fine game now. Not great, but maybe something like a 7/10. Above average and pretty good, but far from perfect.			"

												<<  EDIT: Have now passed the 300 hour mark, and.. STILL LOVING THIS GAME!  >>I am LOVING this game.  Looks like I've about a hundred hours in, and I've barely begin to scratch the surface - but I've been having a heckuva lot of fun playing.  This is a deep, rich, immersive game.  I start it up and the hours happily fly by.I'm gonna keep this short because given the choice I'd prefer to be actually playing the game.  I've only ever bothered to write one Steam review before, but I wanted to toss in my two cents on this game.  I don't know if you'll like it (evidently a good proportion of folks are still determined not to like it) - but I do know this game has given me what I've been searching for a long time.I've been trying a bunch of space / sci-fi games - many of them great games - but to greater or lesser degrees I always felt something missing.  I finally figured out what it was.  It was what I loved most about good sci-fi: the sense of Wonder.  Well I've found it here in this game.This is a richly imagined space game, with a bit of a high fantasy edge - places feel different and alive and beautiful.  I've apparently spent a hundred hours just flying around, exploring, admiring.  I've done some missions, I've done some fighting, I've made some credits, I've made some friends and some enemies - but mostly I've just been smiling a whole lot.I've only seen the tip of the iceberg.  I haven't yet assembled a fleet, or even bought my first Capital ship; I haven't yet built an empire, any stations, or even my first trader; I haven't yet captured my first ship, or even fully pimped out my own.  I have yet to dip into the Teladi DLC, and have already pre-purchased the upcoming HoL DLC.  I see many many many more happy hours ahead.  I think I've finally found my Space Skyrim.It must be disheartening for the Devs to see so much obstinate negativity; they had a vision and they've been working hard to keep polishing it (I'm on the 4.0 beta).  For my own part a big thank you to them, and their next X game will be an instant buy for me.Anyhoo.  If the first hundred or so hours are anything to go by, this game is right among my few all time faves - don't know if you'd like it, but then I don't know if you like ice cream either.  Back to SPAAACE!			"

												TL:DR For the price of €17 ""X Rebirth Complete "" is really a great game if you are into sandbox, space, and sim.  Dont mind the overal ""Mostly Negative"" reviews because they are mostly for when the game was in 1.0-ish. Now the devs have made it into 4.0 and the bugs is not to befound and perforamance is good (see speccs below)2016-06-27:  With 6 hours into the main story there seems to be tons to do and the space feels endless with many paths to pick. The atmosphere is tick and just slowly fly past a forest/farm on a large space ship is a great audiovisuall experience :). The ship control feels right with the mouse/keyboard as well as the handcontroller and the game runs great on a ""old"" 680 with the resolution 1920x1200. I would recommend a SSD for this game because of the small load times will not be felt such as when an old HDD is used.   2016-07-28:20 hours in and the game is becoming better and better. Amazing momement to send the troops to another ship and actually see the swarm of small ships land on the other ship while the rest of the crew is nuking it with laser...2016-08-11: Im at work thinking about how to make the big buck with a new trading strategy that Ive slept on. The game is getting more fun, complex and better looking for each hour... 2016 GOTY for me.2016-12-19: New graphic card (690) and the SLI support is not good at all. But Ive finally having spare time to roam around. Making my first space station.Also the the game will get another update with...VR and IR-tracking support! The devs way to care for their games should be the golden standard for game devs :).			"

												The Sim has great eyecandy, but Key Commands are not as good as XTC. Very difficult to get around in X Rebirth because of this. I only hope Egosoft would consider redoing the ingame commands in a future patch to simplify them and be more inline with X3TC.  From what I can see 3 hours in you can't even dock like you can in TC.  And if that's not possible, how you can you ever tour the stations?  IF I hadn't got the boxed version on sale I don't think I'd have ever bought it.  Very frustrating to play so far.			"

												I purchased this when it originally came out and it was an embarassment to the x series. The campaign was broken (still kind of is), there were numerous mini games you were forced into to get simple things done, lots of bugs and features that were missing for no reason other than ""it's not x3, it's x rebirth"". Fastforward to today and the 2nd dlc HOL has come out with the 4.0 patch and this is a different game. I have to say I actually am enjoying playing the game now. Yes, I'm using some key mods which add the funtionality I want back into the game, but even without the mods the game has improved a lot. I have to change my negative review to positive. I recommend this game if you're into space trading/empire building games. It's a lot of fun.			"

												I waited to purchase this game until 2016 as it had terrible reviews and I wasn't happy with the level of polish that I had seen.  I'm glad that I did.  With the release of 4.0, I finally bought the game.  As a veteran of all of the previous X: Games, I can say that X: Rebirth is finally worth purchasing (as long as you buy the full version with all dlcs)  I would also recommend installing the capital ship bridge mod to round out the X feel.  It's not as complex as the previous X Games but I'm having a lot of fun and it's fairly immersive.  For a 20 man studio, Egosoft did a good job on this game although it took them a while to fix the initial issues.			"

												Almost a year since its release, X: Rebirth is now playable. Although it shouldn't have been released in it's initial state, the developers have constantly updated the game over the last year to iron-out the bugs and improve it.Those who already own the game are being given free DLC which will be released in December 2014, make sure you redeem the DLC before Dec as it may not be available for free after that date.Overall I consider this a good game that has given me hours of enjoyment, not as good as its predecessors, but has a lot more potential for both immersion and modding.

												i think its a good game, ignoring the review rating as most of those reviews are before egosoft patched the hell out of that game. i played the game after they fixed the majority of the bugs and glitches and it is a good game for those who are interested in space sims and/or econemy simulators. i think in some ways it improved from the previous games namely1) ships arent restricted to six turret groups + one front battery anymore2) lesser loadingscreens (going from one part of the universe isnt as painfull as in the previous games which was loading screen - fly to next gate - loadingscreen and you couldnt do anything in the loading screens)3)the universe feels bigger(in the previous games the station were very close due to gameplay reasons, now we have highways, which connect the stations4)capital ships are integrated better into trading5)buiding ships and station takes time now, you cant just order ten battleships in a few minutes6)equiping capital ships with weapons is a bit less of a pain in the backsidealthough it has some disadvantages when compared to the previus games1) you are bound to a single, although upgradable, fighter/bomber class ship (might be because you dont have turret groups anymore so it isnt as easy to tell turrets what to shoot for a player so ego put you into fighter you are bound to, but thats just my theory)2)every weapon type only has one ""bay"". for example you have laser A which only fires one laser at a time and Type B which also fires only one laser at a time.

												It seems like this game had a very rough launch and I'm happy to say that it does not deserve its reputation as a bad game.Having picked up X Rebirth during patch 3.5 it seems that many of the huge problems have been fixed; there are also some very good mods available, just search by highest rated. One large issue that I have with X Rebirth is the inability to pilot different ships. However after playing X Rebirth for a decent amount of time the ship that you fly (The Albion Skunk) has really grown on me. Piloting the skunk around the universe as you build up your forces has a Han Solo feel to it.Overall the I recommend the game to anybody looking for a great sandbox space sim that features tons of emerging mechanics that makes each players experience vastly different. If you are on fence the about buying X Rebirth, wait until it goes on sale and pick it up for cheap.Pros:+ Sound track - top quality stuff, definitely worth the money for the sound track+ Graphics - the older X games really felt lacking in this department and X Rebirth delivers+ Gameplay - piloting feels fun, and large scale fleet actions with capital ships feels omg epic+ Crew - you need to hire staff to run your empire, capital ships need engineers and captains. it adds a bit to the immersion+ Easy to learn - compared to the other X games the learning curve is less steep+ Replayability - with different start options and so much to do (start as a trader, combat pilot, or pursue the main story), the game evolves in so many different waysCons:- Weapons - choice feels very limited, and no real customization in this department- Pace - as with all X games, the game may be too slow for many people. it takes serious time to enjoy the game, especially if you are new to the series- Bugs - there are very annoying bugs, however none that I have encountered have been game breaking- Cannot fly multiple ships - this makes many people sad "

												After all the hype and build-up, and being a long time X-enthusiast (owning EVERY X game prior), the much awaited X Rebirth turned out to be a complete and utter dismal dissappointment. While most game developers would aim to build on existing positives, X Rebirth's devs have taken everything GOOD about the original games, and thrown them completely out of the window in order to squeeze in some ""pretty new graphics"", which in all honesty, aren't that impressive to begin with and seem more of a throwback to mid 2000's graphics engines. The removal of third person views, multiple ship control, gate travel (a new ""taxi tube"" system has been developed to shuttle your ship from system to system, which is absolutely TERRIBLE) and many ""new features"" are actually fancy detractions from what made the original X series so great. The addition of being able to walk around in stations sounded great at first, but is extremely limited in it's function and serves no great logical purpose to the game that couldn't be solved easier with menus and communications channels, except to make the game boringly and frustratingly mundane each time you are forced to wander around stations upon docking. Trade is just about non-functional, often causing game-breaking errors and lockups, and combat although beautiful to watch is just as broken. I am sorry to say that I was duped into pre-ordering this game with the promise of great things... It's a shame it was all a sham, and that no attempt to fix the issues has been made (even though that would basically mean re-releasing the entire game). Save yourself some money (and sanity); DO NOT buy this pile of steaming cowpat!			"

												My intial play through of the game started with Campaign, I locked into the immersion of the Universe as soon as the game loaded but for me that is all the immersion I was going to get. Though my PC outranks the Recommended Specs I have been forced to play on super low graphics settings and stil lget around 8 - 12 fps and I thought that it could not get any worse than that!I felt that the ability to play from within my ships cockpit was great though I was upset with only the 1 ship option and the very hard interface almost like it was developed for me to be using an Xbox game pad hooked up to it. I saw an icon for a Nightclub so I decided to to take a break and check out the ability to leave my ship... I wished I had not, upon leaving the ship I was met by a man with boobs... actually it turned out this was a woman when I showed the screeny to all my friends but none the less it amused me so... I carried on walking and found a Robot that sort of looked like a cross between a Dyson Vacuum Cleaner and WALLE but my eye was caught on something better, Advertisments for the strippers... a lot of raw skin so I hurried my way to the main bar where I was met by not NPC's not even CCC's just badly modelled mannequins with nothing more thna insults to throw at me when spoken to.I met a man on the station selling illegal high grade missiles so I spent all my starting cash on them and returned to my ship where I saved my game... now I only play this when I want to mess about shooting at random objects. (Actually I learnt if I get the cops after me then go into the docking bay of the big capital ships then the police shoot at the capital ship hoping to hit me lol)Overal I'm going to give this game a 3/10, It's not all bad but I can deff recommend you stay well clear of this title until either the sales or they patch it(in fact needs a whole new release let alone a patch) if your looking for something like this then checkout Star Citizen or head back in the series and check out X: Albion Prelude(the introductory game to Rebirth and the end of Terran Conflict)			"

												4.0 + DLC ReviewTL;DR: This is not X4 and it's not meant to be X4. It's a good space-combat-and-fun-flying-around-in-space-sim which has an ill-designed but workable economic system. Dont expect to play for thousands of hours but you can still get more playtime than most other AAA titles.I played a fair bit of X3 TC and AP back in the day. I loved those games so much that I pre-ordered the metal collector's edition for XR. However, the game was a mess at launch and I never really played it until now. With patch 4.0 and the two expansions, the game seems pretty solid.It's not a successor to X3, it's a different game. If you wanted X4, you won't like this. But if you are new to the X series or can approach X:R as a different franchise, free of the trappings of it's predecessors, then you might just like it.The good:- The graphics quality and performance is amazing. Though it's not as pretty as Star Citizen (check the Gamescon 2016 demo), or E:D in the Vive, it's still gorgeous and atmospheric. And I am surprised at how smooth the game is even with ultra settings at 1440p and zipping across with amazing speed along the highways. This on my 2 year old 780 Ti. The stations are huge and detailed (from the outside). You can walk around inside the stations if you want to, but that part is ugly.- Combat is decent- I honestly enjoy it as much as in X3.- The world seems alive. There are literally hundreds and hundreds of ships chugging along the routes and they actually look like space cars and sapce lorries on a busy space highway. Billboards light up the routes, stations look believable, you can even pimp up the cockpit somewhat.- No crashes so far, no serious bugs noticed.The bad:- You can pilot just one ship- which sucks (though you can hire NPCs to run other ships for you). Also, weapons and equipment types are very very limited. This is my biggest problem with the game so far. It just seems very light on this front.- The Economy - it's kinda broken. To be fair, I have never played any game where the economic aspect seemed to be perfectly simulated. However, it's salvagable to an extent - at least in some zones.Also, do check out the Steam workshop for mods. Many of them provide great quality of life improvements. There are even some big ones that fix the shortcomings that I have mentioned here, but then can only go so far.			"

												in short this game sucked hard.no direction in how to play the game. confusing interfaces and controls. the ""tutorial/intro"" section of the game doesn't teach you how to play or how to even interact with the world they build and just abruptly ends, the co-pilot chick on the ship is annoying as hell and the same 6 things she says all the time gets progressively more annoying as she says them for little or not reason at all. the level of detail in important objects is surprisingly low and random ♥♥♥♥ that's not important have more detail. all the NPCs looks like the same old man/woman depending on gender. NPC models are poorly made and down right piles of ♥♥♥♥. the list goes on and on what is wrong with this game.overall its a poorly made game for a series that should have been allowed to die long ago back when it was still good, before this ♥♥♥♥ came out. all the problems aside the outside of space stations mixed with space and the ""living"" world LOOK awesome. but plays like a turd.

												While X:Rebirth definitely got out of the wrong side of bed(yeah, I preordered the game and played it in since version 1.00), this game really was reborn with the patches 2.00 and 2.50. Sure, I can understand those negative reviews coming before Version 2.00 of this game, but now it's more than worth it's money, most certainly because Egosoft won't stop after patch 2.51, but having already announced Version 3.0 with really cool features, I'd say there are most possibly many things to come. Not to mention the great compatibility for mods! X:Rebirth already has a variety of great mods and still modders  are quite active on the Egosoft-Forums.			"

												Gave this game another go after the v2.20 patch, but it still lacks everything that made X3 great. Drool-inducing visuals cannot compensate for the lackluster combat, frustrating missions, lack of economy and horrendous 'fleet' control.It's still an absolute travesty, foreshadowing impending doom for an otherwise great franchise.

												It's like X3:TC, but somehow clunkier, with a worse UI, with more obscure and confusing controls and menus, with far worse and more numerous voice acting. You're stuck inside a single mediocre ship with a co-pilot who does nothing but yammer on about nonsense and yell at the AI for daring to tell you useful information. Just play X3:TC.			"

												The game was a shame at launch. The massive bad reviews (from that date) doesn´t let me lie. Now, almost 2 years later, with uncountable patches and lots of mods (with improved content) I can say that this game is really a gem! Unique at its niche!It is a lot of fun and you won´t find a better space sim / builder in the market nowadays.I just recommend you to buy this + the DLC in a promo sale, cuz the price has not lowered much since its launch. Due to this, I dun believe the price they are asking for is fair.			"

												First I would like to talk about launch, as in my view people kind of gave up on this game right out the gate. This game was unfortunately scarred by a bad launch, rightfully so as the game has its few bugs, flaws, and quirks, as ALL brand new games do. Though most people only spent an hour or so before they ran into some minor game stopping bugs and threw in the towel without even a second glance. For those of us who stuck around and could spare 15 min without rage quiting, looked to the incredible fan base who had our backs with bug work arounds and guides to help get through the troubled launch. After launch and a few days of blasting past bugs and finding work arounds we started getting patches, which have fixed a major amount of bugs making that first hour easier to play through and the game itself easier to complete.Now I want to talk about the game itself. This is a great game, my favorite of the bunch so far.  As expected of the X series this game requires time to progress and unfold into a larger and better game. The depth of this game is immense, and even with 130 hours I still feel as though I have many more hours to go to even begin to master this game. Weither it be trying to run a mining operation or becoming a professional bounty hunter this game always provides a unique challenge. The story line is very well put together and seems almost like a huge extended tutorial, making you learn and rethink constantly. Though tutorial is putting it kindly, as this game will not hold hands with you the whole way, instead this game gives you the push to leave that spaceport and find a path on your own. All in all, I can reccommend this game to anyone who enjoys space/sim/trader/exploration games. If you give it the time and the effort this game will keep you coming back hour after hour for more fun and more adventures.			"

												Single player game. open world, extreme time consuming (it is not a fast game by any means).This game is not a one thin red thread follow game. You have multiply option how to play this game. Offensive, defensive, building, economy, resource gathering, pirate, Good/Bad/Neutral and so on.Hijack any ship that includes a captain or pilot (there is some small ships and some faction ships you can not hijack).Basically they have released a game platform and you are the one who make the choice where/when/how to make it.I was there when they released this game and it is nothing like that anymore. it does still have some bugs that they are hammering out. Feel free to do some reading about this latest version and se the opinions from there.You get your money worth of gaming, if you do like this kind of gameplay.i can advice you to use gamepad. me self are playing with PS4 controller, it's working smoothly ones you have it config with your playstile.glhf			"

												Being a huge fan of the X series I was shocked by the state X:Rebirth was released in:The performance was terrible, the game crashed constantly, you couldn't even play through the main story because one of the first quests just bugged out and kept you stuck. The game was a frustrating mess.My experience with Egosoft however was, that they usually continue maintaining their games over a long period of time and so I kept following the development of things as they rolled out one patch after the other.Now, with version 3.20 I can finally say, that the game is now in a proper playable state.They fixed most of the performance issues, the story quests work as intended, station building and fleet management works fine and the AI is starting to improve as well.Finally they added more ship models, don't force you to walk around stations anymore to trade your inventory and upped the threat that pirates pose. So, if you were thinking about getting this game but weren't sure if you really should because of the bad stuff you heard from frustrated early buyers, I think now is the time to pick it up without having any regrets.I expect Egosoft to improve the game for a long time now, so there should be something new going on every once in a while that will keep me coming back to it and thus never removing it from my hard drive for ages.

												I have played most of the x series, and this is the first one that I feel that I did not have to master economics and spreadsheet management before taking on a ship.  It was great to get into a ship and fly without having to cross endless space, even with SETA engaged.  It also like the fact that space is now colorful, and the highways make it nioce to get from place to place.  I do expect a lot more to learn in the coming weeks, but I am wondering if all those people waiting on Star Citizen and Elite may want to try out this while they are waiting.  I did enjoy the x series of games, but they were hard to get into.  If I had an hour to kill, I wouldn't open up an x game because it takes an hour justr to get started it seems.  This version is not like that.  I recommend!			"

												I have many hours playing this game, many restarts, and many crashes. I can honestly say that after the first 4 hours of play I could tell that this was a subpar game. Since I doubt that I could get a refund I am hopeful that this game can have some new life breathed back into it by the community. The modders have rallied and begun CPR on this title.. So now I have many mods installed and things are better, but almost all of the mods I have loaded should have not been necessary. This is the part that makes me angry, it's not like this is Ego's first rodeo. They are supposed to be professionals. How many releases do they have to bumble through to get it right, or even get close to getting it right. I'm not talking about the constant crashes, poor optimization, it's the obviously taped on amateurish content and features, ""living, breathing, universe"", indeed.. Perhaps if it were filled with the barley breathing. I just don't see how anyone can defend this title or the developers. You psychophants must have your happy helmets strapped on too tight, or maybe you haven't even played the game for more than a few hours.			"

												This game is a terrible addition to the series.  It has taken the exploratory element as well as the advancement element of the X-Series and mutilated it horrifficly.  Also a terribly buggy release.Came back to check if it got any better.Technically it did.There was no crashing, I could trade, and I only had one bug on the main quest line....That said the core gameplay was lacking in comparison of the old game.Still staring blankly at highways instead of a load screen when transitioning.No fast SETA acceleration (fast forwards) so when waiting for something to happen it takes FOREVER.You still have to fly circles around a station to figure out what prices are until you buy a module to not have to play a sucky mode.Even once you get the module the prices are still ridiculously terrible until you talk to people, fly around the station some more and hack the station.Don't get attached to your stuff you get early on if you're playing campaign mode.Still stuck in one ship, and upgrades are fairly linear and bland.They make you buy cockpits that arent obtrusive.Couldnt figure out how to tell my ships to just dock at a station to protect them.You NEED an afterburner to get anywhere without dying of old age first, but when you use it you're sacrificing your shields so getting to a distant fight is either brain melting or you arrive at half shields...Nope, still cant reccomend it, if it were a star system I would probably score it in the 1-2 range.

												First of all: I really wanted to love this game.  I waited several weeks after day one, to have the significant performance problems and the huge range of different problems patched. And credits to Egosoft for actually making a big amount of problems vanish. The problem remains though: 1 1/2 months after release I still have a completely unplayable game (performancewise 1-4 FPS/s on lowest settings) in my Steam Library even though my rig meets the recommended specs and even improves slightly upon them. So no, i can not recommend an unfinished game( no matter how good it might be, if it was actually working). Pls wait at least several months with your purchase until all the problems are patched or at least make absolutely sure that someone with your exact same hardware and drivers has good performance.

												Biggest disappointment of my gaming life!I have been playing since the days of Apogee ( Commander Keen, Duke Nukem ) but this is the game that disappointed me the most.I love the games of the X series before. While they were buggy sometimes the whole size and possibilities of the universe kept me playing for hours. Then came the Linux port and I was really happy playing again while waiting for Rebirth.The trailers looked nice and while I didn't think Egosoft was developing it in the right direction I had faith.I bought the game on launch and was massively disappointed.The engine is *slow*, framerates are really low. But the worst is that it's not fun at all and I did try it!The game mechanic is so simplified that there is not much to do. The freighters have little command options and the ones they have only work half of the time.As much as it pains me to say but stay away from this game, it's not worth it, not even for 5€ on sale.Too bad, I was hoping for another game in the rich X Universe.

We all keep ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on this game in the reviews, but the devs listen. Instead of calling it ♥♥♥♥ and walking away just give it a chance and note what needs changing in your opinion. That's how ambitious ideas such as these work themselves out. I have enjoyed the little time I have played.

												I loved X3, TC and AP and yes they were flawed and infuriating at times, but they were at least decent and unique games that were just a little rough around the edges. I gave egosoft too much credit with this game, I assumed they would take this opportunity to learn from their mistakes and do it right this time. They took seven years to do it for crying out loud. But no. This is a terrible game, filled with terrible WTF design decisions. I have no faith this will ever be a worthwile game. Everything good about the previous games isn't here at all, and the so called 'improvements' they've made just leave me scratching my head. I mean, at some point surely one of the developers looked up and said, 'actually this is pretty s**T, I think we need to rethink what we've done'. But they didn't. Sorry EGOSoft, but I don't have any faith in you anymore as a developer. You clearly don't have the self awareness to know when you're on a winner and when you're building a steaming pile. Maybe if you somehow survive as a company and decide to make X4 I might give you another chance. But I will be very hesitant to give you my money again. You did not deserve it this time.			"

												Ambitious game, great concept. X games are usually awesome. But stay AWAY from this one. Riddled with gamebreaking bugs, horrible optimization (low fps on high end pcs), incredibly bad animations and character models, WORSE voice acting. Trading system is said to be very intuitive, and its not supposed to be broken according to EGOSOFT. If its working as intended its the WORST trade window in a game ever. Ambience is awesome, combat is okay (exeption is the fps drops), but gets boring fast. The concept of boarding cruisers is great, but there is no way to gague the progression system of marines, and you end up wasting ur time, and your boardingparty just dies either way. Feels like this game was supposed to be developed for xbox 360, but didnt cut it. So instead of having a useless unfinished product, they made a horrible port to the PC, and just slapped full price on it, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on their customers.

												I do not recommend this game if you are an X fan or not. If you are an X fan then youl will be disappoined in the fact that you only get to have one pilotable ship and some drones. The interface is really poor and is nothing like the previous X series games. It seems more like an FPS console port. Furthermore, I have been trying to get some response from Egosoft and Steam about getting my money back for this game since it was completely misrepresented by Egosoft and the numerous glitches that are still vastly noticeable in the game.The final word I give: I do not recommend buying this game if you are a fan of the X series.

												I stopped playing this game due to excessive bugs when it was first released. Now update 2.00 has cleaned up many of the bugs and the game is actually playable now. The hauler you control can actually move now to complete the trade mission. The framerate is a solid 50fps except for brief moments when combat begins. I am loving the ability to purchase different cockpits. I am using combat mk3 and since it is transparent i get the full screen to play with. This game is getting better but I feel the trading to be uncompelling and going full combat is the easier way with just looting missles for cash. Capital ships actually shoot now so it is harder.I do not reccomend this game, even if it is on sale since it's predeccesor x3:tc / x3 ap are both cheaper and WAY better games. If you are looking for an alternative game just look for star citizen or the new elite.			"

												Simply put, this game is terrible. I loved the previous X games, but actually found them a little bit too involving so I couldn't just jump in and out of them after weeks/months had passed so this game should have suited me down to the ground. However it is just an incredibly poor attempt from Egosoft, it was released in an unplayable state and I was amazed at just how much they got wrong, given the complete lack of content compared to previous games!Many people are irked by the console like controls and what looks to have been an intended console release at some point, however I could have quite happily lived with that if there was a game underneath that could be enjoyed without random crashes, a broken storyline, terrible lack of information on basic controls & mission aspects as well as the questionable performance.

												Show me your wares please.Edit: With the new 2.5 patch - it's been getting better. I can actually use my HOTAS Warthog joystick now! Compared to the bull that it was in 1.0. The joy of having your throttle device having a button that states ""AUTOPILOT ENGAGE/DISENGAGE"" and binding your autopilot ingame to that...The game still needs tons of work - but it's been improving. The general feel of the X series is now there - but it still lacks good empire building... and multiple ships.Still not recommended as of October. Let's see how 3.0 is.			"

												I picked up the collectors addition recently and have been giving it a go. It is very different for x3 which I've spent a large number of hours playing. Playing on ubuntu on an under spec machine but it still plays decent with not one crash in 10 hours or so. So far I'd give it a 6/10 for gameplay. Very steep learning curve but that's one of the things I'm enjoying is learning how to get things done. Universe feels generic, ie finding a lost colony that's been isolated for hundreds of years, but they have the same clothes, same dang space station interior and space highways. The space station premise is poorly executed and feels like a waste of time but it looks like some functions can be managed over radio at least. I don't like the limitation of one ship, that was part of the cool factor of x3, but it's not a deal breaker.I am going to keep playing, partially out of stubbornness to look past the faults and partially out of enjoying what does play well.

												It is with much reluctance I have to say No. I so wanted to like this game and mine and the community expectations pre-release were so high. Bugs will be (and are) being fixxed, but the basic design and loss of so many key gameplay and control features from previous incarnations has left this a generally empty and unfulfilling experience.For those of you wanting a definitive space bulding and exploration experience, roll back and look at Egosofts earlier relase X3 Terran Conflict. (NOT Albion Prelude, this DLC adds game events that will  furstrate the overall game if you don't have a good grounding in the basic gameplay.)For those of you who are familiar with X, then if you really want to roll back to an experiece equivalent to X-BTF designed for the forthcomming Steam Console, well, you probably got stung by the pre-order already.

												From the initial terrible release of X-Rebirth with lots of really nasty bugs, after a lots of patching by Egosoft  today I would highly recommend this game to all space sim / trade empire players. X-Rebirth provides a unique approach to building trade empire, different than previous X3 games TC & AP, allowing building predefined industrial complexes in a step by step approach, station exploration and many other new features. In-space graphics is  stunning, sound & music are great quality. The graphics inside stations and especially NPC graphics is still poor and needs improvement.  Afte exciting news that 4.0 patch with lots of necessary improvements and new DLC Home of Light with expansion of existing galaxies will be released in February 2016, well  simply I cant wait for it..

												There are some kerbal dolls (see kerbal space program) hidden on some of the stations. That was cool. The game it's self is not at all like X3. I miss being able to exit my ship and fix it with a repair beam (although I would have liked this to not be considered a hostile action in X3 when doing it to other ships and stations--something I think is bug). Interacting with aliens makes no sense. There is this weird frequency bar mini-game that's never explained , and, depending on when you click depeds on if your dialouge action is positive or negative (even when you think you've figured it out, the success results still seem entirely random)--more negative, and your rating goes down with them or that faction, more positive and you can get better prices.  Yeah sure, it's cool to be able to get out of your ship and explore stations, but that ends up being the majority of the game. You never have to fly around to make a fortune--just sneak around stations and raiding stuff. You're also suck with one ship type, and that's it. If they took X3, and added the ability to explore stations and explore your own ship, then yeah, it would have been a good game... not this. I could never really get into it.Hold out for the next release of X, and lets hope they get it right this time.			"

												First thing I should say is that I did enjoy this game and giving it a not recommended review is entirely based on the games unstable behaviour on my PC.Here's my rig specs :- CPU: Intel Core i7 4770K Watercooled and Overclocked to 4.7GHz- Motherboard: Gigabyte Z87X-OC- RAM: Team Group Vulcan Orange 8GB (2x4GB) 2400MHz C10- Graphics: 2 x AMD Radeon R9 290X 4096MB Graphics Cards in Crossfire & Watercooled- Cooling: Full Custom Watercooling Loop, Mayhems Orange Pastel Fluid- Primary Drive: Samsung 840 Evo Series 1TB SSD- Secondary Drive: Seagate Barracuda 2TB SATA-III Hard Drive- Optical Drive: LG Blu Ray RRW- Audio: 7.1 Channel HD Audio with SPDIF I/O- Operating System: Microsoft Windows 8.1 64-Bit- Power Supply: Super Flower Leadex 80+ Gold Rated 1000W Silent Power SupplyIt's more than enough to run this game at 60fps yet after the recent big 2.0 update I found that my fps dropped massively compared to before the update despite this update claiming many fixes. Even turning down the graphics options to low would not fix this for me.To top it off, after the update I started to get blue screen crashes which would make my PC buzz loudly and cause me to have to hard boot it.In light of this I've now decided to uninstall the game despite only getting 55 hours of play from it, which for this game is pretty low as I intended to play it as much as I could over the next year, or until Elite Dangerous was in my possession.I think I'll now have to bite the bullet and pay that premium price for ED to get my space epic fix.The best part of the game are the graphics, they are stunning in places and the shear awe factor is enough to make you want to ignore its faults. Sadly, wanting to ignore the faults and being able to are two entierly different things.The voice acting, is horrid, NPC's are dull, lifeless and poorly annimated and singularly bring this game down to a mediocre title rather than being an epic, and if these were given more love in the developement stages it could have reached those heights.For me the bugs were just too much and I'm no longer prepared to stick with this game and I will switch to the Elite game as soon as I'm able to afford it.

The voice acting and characters are incredibly dull. The user interface when trying to conduct anything is a pain to get through. I've wasted so much time trying to navigate my way through the UI, I just gave up. The highway system feels like a cheap, last minute addon. I just can't recommend this title.

												Xrebirth is a good game it has alot of potential for advancement into something far greater than it currently is at this stage. For example a storyline with a mass effect 3 or better instead of just a space game add a people individual action to it. Also I have played this awhile. I have sort of grown to it. IF the bugs of station ships not working , traders not trading , It sure would be nice if there was a total overide command to wake the game or diagnose the conflict of what is wrong with the players game which said fix this or delete that or whatever without getting the error messages on startup saying cannot load game account stuff like galaxy communication not on because it was part of the problem and have to start all over in the game, or any other error message as a matter of fact on the menu selection.ships not transferring wares between them and station bto builders not building got fixed along with the other bugs in the game got fixed when steam updates or modders update or egosoft updates . If everyone had some common ground to play the game the way they want to play it , that would be one heck of a game This game could really evolve into something far more that what it is. But everyone needs to work together with the creators of the game and steam and the modders. When a modder updates their mod and/or adds a newer version of the mod it kills the game for other players or at least the ones who do not know how to fix whats wrong, like me. I have come to the point of creating a decent empire only to have some bug mess up the whole game. But like I said it is a great game or it can evolve to a greater game it all depends on you guys and what you want. Please just fix all the bugs and compadability.			"

												Much like all other Egosoft games this game had a VERY ROCKY release and most of the negative reviews are from that time period. I played many of the other X Series games over the years so I knew to wait a few years until the game was playable. With that said ...This game is great now. It doesn't feel exactly like an X game, but it's still wonderful and fantastic. It has a lot of the old X elements that are incorporated giving that traditional 4X feel, but now you can explore ships and stations and the world feels a whole lot more full. The voice acting, graphics, missions, they all feel so much better than in the past were they were campy and slow.I realize 33% of reviews for this game are positive at the time of me writing this review, but this game is seriously a good 90% positive now that everything's been fixed and dozens of features have been added.

I have yet to delete the game as I keep coming back to see if it has improved and while performance wise it has, it just is not a good game. The x games had a great following of loyal fans... but this game has just gone so far astray to what X is that it can hardly be considered part of the series. You can only pilot one ship... the highway system of travel is absurd... any graphics outside of your ship are atrocious... station scanning?? lame. Sometimes the graphics can be nice in space but gameplay is what really matters. Stick to the x3 games until Star Citizen comes out.			"

												The game WAS bad at launch (hence the mostly negative score) but that was a long time ago. The current version of the game is great and the devs are already working on the next game in the series which will build upon this one and implement some of the features that this one was lacking but X3 had like being able to pilot all ships. Support the development of the next game in the series by purchasing this one, you'll get to play this game which is quite good on its own, and also contribute to the next iteration X game, which may just become the modern day X3 we're all waiting for.

												I'm sorry guys, I really love your other games, but compared with other X games, this is awful.  A single ship, clunky interface, hard to read labels, and so generally dissimilar from its predecessors; I can't get into it.  Interesting concept, poor execution.  I like the premise and hope you bring back the look and feel of the older games in the same setting for future installments.			"

												Game has come a long way since its horrible launch. With the constant patches and now 2.0 update it shows EGOSoft are clearly listening to their players. It still has a ways to go to be comparable to X3, but at least it is playable and enjoyable now and EGOSoft has indicated it has no plans on slowing down with the patches and updates.			"

												Many people hated this game - Or ones that I've talked to anyways - Because it's not like X3. Who cares? Personally I think it's better. X Rebirth is much more forgiving to new players. My only issue with this game has been that there's no real tutorial for this game. Example, I want to build a trade empire. I've no idea how to even do that, there's no tutorial with Empire Builder. But that aside this game is still worth the play. You can tell Egosoft has worked tirelessly fixing the buggy mess that this game once was - Which is the reason people also regard this game as terrible too. Me, I think their effort has paid off. The graphics are great. The mechanics are much more simpler for newer players now, space looks ""wow!"", and with the addition of the Steam Workshop, there's just so much more you can do with this game now. I'd recommend it to any new players, and any old players who've shoved this game to the side because of it's release. Give it one more try guys huh?			"

MASSIVE SPACE STATIONS ARE FULL OF SHOPS IMPOSSIBLE TO MEMORIZE, MAP IS A DISSASTER (NEVER SAW WORSE - THE IDEA OF ZONES IS POINTLESS).			"

												I really wanted to like it, I really enjoyed previous entries in the series but this one just falls so short in so many ways.  One example of why I can't stand X:R would be fast travelling, instead of having simply zoning or jump gates there's this highway system that's a bit like a drain pipe you have to fly around in.  It's effectively its own minigame and it sucks.  When I'm in it, I can't clearly see the boundaries, when I don't want to fall out of it I inevitably do, when I do want to fall out of it I struggle too do so.  I don't need simple fast travel navigation around the world to be it's own minigame.  I'm here to fly around in space and shoot and loot stuff.  Not to struggle and get frustrated just trying to get from point A to point B so I can participate in story line content.I feel pretty much the same way about walking around stations as well.  I'm not here to play 'wander the station looking for relevant NPCs and random piles of cash hidden about a station"".  I'm here for the sci-fi space ship sim.  Quit trying to take me away from it, or if you're going to do so make sure it's in exchange for truly fun and interesting content and not just a thiny vieled time sync.			"

												Huge disappointment, thats to put it very simply.Do not waste cash on this! rather wait for -Star Citizen- or get any previous X series game.I was really enjoying the previous X series and had hoped that they would continue the series with X rebirth, instead they chose to make something that feels like a concole port, herea are some of the game breakers ive found so far:- The movement of the ship is weird.- The mechanics of the game are weird.- You cant look around in the ship anymore. (no key bindings or track ir)- The hud is boring and uninformative.- No tutorial although the game is completely different to the other X games.- The controls in general, including ship and crew controls are unintuitive to say the least.- The graphics while pretty lack any kind of effort in the modeling of characters.- The story is uncompelling and boring.- Highway system while good idea is boring and sometimes confusing and is poorely designed.- Support for HOTAS is very limited.- Walking in stations is a feature that is completely unnecessary and is poorely designed.- Interacting with objects is poorely designed and implemented.- Walking in your own ship is limited to one room, you cant even walk around in the cockpit as entering it is scripted.Learning this game is suprisingly even harder than in the previous X series games, at least back in them, most things were quite intuitive.All in all, a big disappointment, a well marketed one but disappointment nevertheless.

												What can I say, this is literally a game that was designed to be released on the XBox, but released on the PC. It has many features missing, many game breaking bugs, and many systems in place that do nothing but try and ruin the game for you.They force you to go through stations in order to get crew for your ship, and upgrade. The stations are mostly cut and paste between less than 5 models, and are meant for you to go blindly through and rob it blind. Character models look like something from the 90's, and there is no variation in communication.In space, nobody can hear you scream as your trade ships lock up. Your combat ships might as well be ornaments since you can't tell them to attack, and unless it's a capital ship, it's dead before it can attack back. As of writing this, you can't buy small ships to outfit your fleet or small trade ships to embark on cheap trading.If you get far enough from station, you can no longer access trades that were previously there. Stations are not able to be freely placed, and if you don't pay careful attention, they don't function.The save files are uncompressed XML files, meaning if you have access to notepad, you can cheat your way to achievments by editing them to your hearts content. The install is laden with files that are meant to be used on XBox. Regular controls for computer such as the keyboard/mouse/joystick don't function as well as a computer game should run. XBox controller has full support though.This is an alpha port, the developers are patching every day or two to fix issues. When it finally fixes enough issues to be a full release, I'll ammend this.			"

												X: Rebirth looks to be an immersive game, but ultimately the gameplay is neither fun nor even engrossing.  As a massive fan of space games and someone who loved X3:TC and X3:AP (51 hrs and 59 hrs), I was eagerly anticipating the X: Rebirth launch as a chance to reengage in the space genre, but this time as a freelancer pilot in an exciting universe.  Unfortunately, X: Rebirth is not that game.Ultimately, the game may be fun at some point, but there are far too many constant gameplay aspects that try to be immersive and accessible at the expense of true immersion and fun.  It feels as though the game was not properly play-tested by players, and the experience suffers.  That being said, I’m sure examples would help.  This is not an exhaustive list, but here are some highlights.1.	In order to trade larger trade goods, you must fly and find trading points to setup the order.  While that means you need to travel, this doesn’t make sense in context of being “in the future.”  How is there not a global listing for known trade hubs/markets/etc?  I understand wanting people to fly to these locations to make them more real, but ultimately this feels forced and unrealistic.2.	In order to trade smaller goods, you must dock at a station point and then run inside the station to get to individual traders.  This is not realistic nor immersive. I have drones, warp-speed and ‘advanced’ computer systems, but I can’t make transactions via my ship?  It’s like the trade system was designed for a medieval RPG.3.	Exploration consists of sending out a radar-like beacon and flying to hits.  I really liked this initially, but unfortunately it’s mostly just random items in cans and I have no way to distinguish junk from large ships or hidden nuggets (if they exist).  Once I retrieve these goods, I have to walk in a station to trade said good.  This doesn’t make me feel immersed, this makes me feel like I’m playing a poorly designed game.4.	I’m only able to fly in my one cockpit view.  It’s neat how I move to my seat and can move around the ship, but the display is far too obstructive.  ~30% of the viewing space is taken up by cockpit walls/dashboard.  It is incredibly restrictive, and ultimately doesn’t make sense.  When I’m in a car, the top of the windshield isn’t 15% of my field of view so why would a spacecraft be the same way.5.	GUI and map interface are atrocious.  Yes, the game was designed for console players, but unfortunately things are just archaic feeling.  Why can’t I zoom in/out of the map?  If I can, why isn’t there a button on the map to press?  Why do I need to use a Mass Effect style convo bar to access menu items that could easily be accessed by a sidebar or escape menu?  I really wanted to enjoy this game, but it’s not really a game and more of a chore.  If you enjoyed the world immersion of X3:TC or X3:AP, look somewhere else.  Maybe EVE Online for the truly immersive world.  Forcing someone to walk around like a character in a medieval RPG is not actual immersion, it’s only a narrow-minded developer opinion of true immersion. "

												Egosoft. Whether or not it was intentional, I think you know that what you have released was not as advertised.I am an avid PC gamer, and have been playing PC games since they began. I'm also an avid space sim gamer, and have enjoyed all manner of space games from back in the first Elite days. I enjoyed your previous games. But my disappointment in Rebirth is, well, palpable. Based on many posts in many forums, while my exact feelings may not be shared by all who have purchased X Rebirth, you know I am not alone in my dissatisfaction.I know you are a very small company, and given the posts I've seen, you seem to be working hard to scramble together fixes for game crashing bugs, mission breaking glitches, and issues that leave the player immoble. My immediate reaction is - any amount of playtesting would surely have shown some of these very basic game breaking issues - why didn't you take care of these gigantic issues *before release*? I understand that no software is released without bugs, but come now - surely you see this as excessive (perhaps even for a beta, much less a release)?Beyond the game breaking issues, there are so many changes that would be necessary to make this a game that doesn't seem to be some sort of weird retro alpha project stuck in the mid-90s, that I don't feel right about paying you with my hard earned money to attempt a belated fix for something that, frankly, may simply need to be scrapped and redone to even approach a mediocre product.  And the way this game was advertised vs the actual in-game exprience is approaching fraudulent. It seems like a joke.  Just not a funny one.7 years? You worked on this for 7 years? I honestly don't buy that. Even a single developer working on a project for *7 years* could produce a much better designed product with much fewer crashes than this. You had a good base from which to start. What did you do for 7 years that this was the end result? I'm sorry Egosoft, but I want my money back. And I likely won't get a refund. Congrats for taking one more sucker for his $50, but ""fool me once..."" It will never happen again.			"

												Too buggy of a game, lots of things do not work correctly.  No where near as good as the X games prior, completely gutted game with a lot of the complexity of the old games gone.  They didn't take any steps forward with this game, but went backwards.  Game feels like it was a game they were trying to make for the consoles, meant to be in a completely different universe from the X series, but they failed some where and then tried to ram this game into the X series by just changing some of the names to match the X series while not changing anything else.  Really failed game..			"

												X rebirth in its updated state is by far one of the most interactive and approachable X game to date, no its not as complex nor does it have the same sense of customisation as previous titles but it is able to be picked up from the start without the need for large amounts of cash grinding or endless travelling back and forth through sectors as seen in previous titles.Combat to is much more approachable as the controls feel much more responsive and streamlined to a point where you actually want to participate in fights rather than just rely on the autopilot.Trading and empire management are the defining elements of any X game and whilst rebirth had a rocky start and still has a few problems rebirth by far has the best trading system to date. once trades have been unlocked all available trades can be accessed through the one screen and available ships can quickly be swapped to as needed, additionally trade requests can be qeued up to be conducted automatically (autonomous trading mods are available to bring back stuff like galactic traders)The most important thing to note is that rebirth has a live economy which is generated on your pc (not some silly cloud computing) meaning that blowing up trading vessels or stations can have a big impact on the economy (without SETA however this can take real human hours to notice), additionally trades are conducted automatically between stations within each zone through the use of mass traffic (no its not just FPS eye candy).Stations too have improved apon the old complex system getting rid of the spidersweb of stations seemingly linked together through a bunch of string with individual parts of the station being assigned to raw materials (e.g steel plates) final products (e.g drones) or effeciency improvements with the option for station defences to be constructed (so you no longer need a fleet to protect your stations.All of this can understandably cause a few problems (my game for example loves to chew almost 8gb of RAM) or result in some tradeoffs (First person mode is not all that exciting after awhile) but for a game that tries to achieve the best of both worlds (space shoot em up and economics management) Egosoft did (and is still doing through regular updates) a pretty good job and where it feels lacking you can often find a solid mod to help you out.In conclusion Rebirth is really a game that depends on your tastes, if you just want to shoot stuff with lite trading elements try Elite dangerous or if you want a full on space trading sim try picking up x3 Terran conflict. But if you want something a little more involved that isn't too steep a learning curve then give rebirth a shot			"

												X:Abortion might be good in a year, but the chances of that even with an avid modding community are slim next to 0.Buggy, broken, unpolished and unfinished filled with game stopping errors, crashes, and tasks; this game is simply released as an Alpha sold at a full price.Egosoft are known for bad releases, and i expected bugs crashes, which can all be easily patched out. This fails at its fundamental X game Core. Designed as a console game, rejected, and then re-layered as a ""PC Exclusive"".THE ONLY positive thing I have to say about this game is its environment visuals. Some of the sectors look gorgeous, but other than that, every other thing in the game is poor, dysfunctional or broken.Avoid at all costs.If you are still in the market for an X experience, i highly recommend X3:Terran conflict, or Albion Prelude.

												Review : As Of 04/08/2015.Rough Platime : 30 Hrs ishWell what can i tell you about the game X: Rebirth.I dont know really as its a mixed bag to be honest.What i can say is that it is very different to the earlier X: Series of games from what i have seen on Youtube !.There is still a steep learning curve to the game and depth that can go on for hundreds and even possibly thousands of hours alone just from playing through the campaign and continueing on building and finishing your empire of evil badass pirates or as anything you can think of basically.You can only use one ship as your main command vessel and where you will be spending most of your time doing all the things you can in the X: Rebirth Series of games to create and get a fully productional corperation going,BUT.Saying this. MAYBE you would rather more play as a bit of a rogue or hero, pirate, even mining.This is what the X: Series of games is all about.Giving you choice with one hand in choosing the playstyle you like.Whilst on the other hand they ""depending how you see it !"" take it away by only letting you have and fly one ship.Bar the ones you can buy and have in your group.The flipside to this is that there is a good many MODS on the workshop that add in some useful functionallity like the adding back of the ships bridge on capital ships, ""not tried yet ""trying to play vanilla first !"" ""What i can also say is that yes at times the game seems to screw you over so badly it seems like pure Majik and blind luck that the mission you have finally done was one son of a bith to get going right and finally let me carry on about my buisness.""Yeah, for you guy's that have allready been there i bet ya's had guessed it that i was on about the #100energycellsmission ! "" PURE FREAKIN NIGTMARE TO GET WORKING RIGHT, And i was on the latest version, version 3.53(193580 - 64bit),I swear to holy GAMEEOBA i must have done at least 5 clean restarts of the game before i finally sussed it all out and how to go about doing the mission.Un bloody believable.However when the game dose work right it does do it well.Now, there is still some major issues there that need to be fixed and patched from what i have been reading here and on the egosoft forums.Personally i havent come across any game breaking bugs that are so bad that you are unable to play.My performance is ok, not the best i would like it at but i can still play with some wiggle room before the fps dips every now and again.Overall i intend to put a lot more hours into this game and apart from the crap at the start with the #100energycells headache fiasco extraordinaire, then things do seem to get better with the missions/campaign.One thing i will say though when using the rahanas for the deliveries is that you have to be patient, you have to WAIT untill you are notify'd that they are there and picking up the goods,
You have to remain patient, 
dont forget you are part of a major huge economy when you are playing any X: series of games, so you have to wait just like any other transport or delivery vehicle when you need to dock your other ships, with the Albion Skunk, you dont have to wait, you can slalom around the mines and sattelites and mining headqurters as well as check out asteroids to your wee hearts content.
The mods to this game are really good.You can get it where it makes the game much harder than it is allready by adding in wars - faction wars - xenon fights - tradeing - fighting - exploring !!! there is a fair few there, but if you look through and read about the high ranking ones and most liked and subbed then you can guess that the mod is safe and good to go/use.Anyhows time to end this review.Bare in mind anybody that does read my review all the way to now, as this bit is really important.If you are looking for a decent and deep learning curve space sim, then YES, you have found the right game with X: Rebirth, just bare in mind that there is a lot of negative reviews hating on the game as it wasnt how they expected it or that it wasnt like the older X: Games, i'd say read them BUT also take them with a pinch of salt, the games been out a while since then and it has improved quite a lot from what i had been reading about it.Strange thing is i was going to buy it about a year ago but was put off by the Bad Reviews, How i wished i had brought into it back then, then again that said, i wouldnt have also gotten it at the deal i did either recently.The game has significantly gotten better from what i can see and read, from the train wreck of the apparent release of it.Anyways this is my review and score :8/10Cheersmark117h			"

												Its different then the past X-games. But I like X-Rebirth as much as the X3 series.  Its true, you can ""fly"" only one ship but you can have a massive fleet from small rangers, medium freighers, till large and extra large capital ships (those capital ships can be longer then 1000m).  With a simple mod - capital ship bridge - can you land your skunk on a the capital ship you own and give the captain orders.  I like to play this way ==> 90% of my playtime is standing around on the bridge from my main capital ship from my fleet, ordering personnel around, remote managing my trade empire, remote managing everything to be hounest, while in the meantime the captital ship i'm on is flying around in the universe.  When the Capital ship i'm on ill run to my skunk so that i can enter battle together with my capital ship.Its true, you don't fly the ship yourself anymore, but i still feel completely in command when ill stand around on my capital ship, givinfg orders to the captain, defence officers, engineers..On top of that, you can build space station sthat are km's and km's long, You can be a trader, pirate, etc.. You can be and do whatever you want.  Space is gorgeous, and everytime you think you start to master the game a whole new lot of possibilities come clear to you and a whole new segment from the game opens up.While the game is easyer to learn then its predecessor it still can have a very steep learning curve for people new to the Space-X4-genre.

												Reviewing based on V.3.53Clarification FIrst: Ok, so I know a lot of people are seeing the bad reviews, but the truth is, if you never played an X-Series game, then this game will be very over whelming. This was also tru for x3-Reunion when i started with the X-Series. Overwhelmning /= Bad GameIf you have played the X-Series, (more so X3-Reuniong, Terran Conflic and/or Albion Prelude) and were hoping for ""X4"" you ended up disapointed at first. THIS GAME IS NOW X4.Not X4 /= Bad GameThe Simple Review:So, a review, This game is a new Space adventure game, using Egosofts newest gaming engine. This new engine i should warn you likes to use the newest computer hardware possible, so if you think ur PC is as strong as a PS4, you may wanna upgrade (at least if you are obsessed with playing on ultra at 60FPS) <- dont kid yourself, you wont be able to without somethign beyond anyones budget. The reason is because this game is meant to evolve over years, you play it, and come back years later and the visuals look even more amazing because Computer Hardware has become more amazing (I'm a Computer Enthusiast).Graphics:As i said above its really a 10/10 if you can even play on medium, but if you just wanna see the future, find a not to clouded area and set it to Ultra, it becomes 30/10, The only issue with the graphics is the NPCs, they are not as pretty and refined as they COULD be, but seeing as its the first attempt at this, ever i think, and on a newly designed engine, i let it slide.Sound:Space game with a good sound track, (I think i still prefered X3's but thats a matter of opinion, and if you play one game for years, you tend to put that music on a pedestel)Gameplay:you literally do WHAT YOU WANT....Sandbox means, you can be a pirate, and just kill and steal, you can be a Trader, making your money to fund your empire via cargo, Adventurer, doing missions to make your Billions, or start your own factory (late game, or specific start) to become rich. hell you can mix all four if you'd like.Community:Developers and Beta Testers work hard to find and fix many bugs glitches and gaps in the game, patches come out often because of the hard work.10/10 would suport Egosoft again, even with the rough start back in 1.0-3.00			"

												Absolutely, unquestionably, the worst attempt at a ""AAA"" game that I've seen in a very long time. It's so incredibly bad, that I got the distinct feeling of being swindled. Like, old-timey swindled, by a man wearing a stolen coat, selling a bottle of cure-all on the corner of two dirt roads, with a pet monkey napping on the hood of his dusty car.I'm serious. It's so bad, that they had to know it was bad. They knew it was bad, and put it up for pre-order and release, knowing they'd rake in a rather large sum of money before the game was playable.How is it bad - there is no single way in which it is good. The voice acting is worse than the most pathetic attempt at game-making by students. Junior High School students. The graphics look as though they were brought here from 2004. The storyline is all but non-existent. The writing is about on-par with that of a 3rd grader. The character design is something you'd see in the back of a homework folder on that weird kid's desk in High School - you know, the one who thinks he's an artist, but can't draw. The ship, there's only one by the way, is all of 3 rooms, only two which can you walk in, and there is zero interactability within those rooms.The pilot interface is awful. The entire game interface is awful. It's very clearly made as a console port, except they never said a word about consoles and released to PC first. The game is riddled with so many crippling bugs, that it's literally unplayable. After only 20 minutes, I was forced to restart, because a game-breaking bug halted any progress that could made. The music, for which they attempted to sell pre-release soundtracks, is mediocre at best, and only by a 2004 standard. The interior of space stations is the same, in every station. The NPC speech is apalling, they say hello, then immediatley say something rude to you, and cut off speech. There basically isn't any reason to speak to any of them. In fact, there isn't any reason to *do* anything at all. They touted the game to be so many things, but in the end, it isn't even playable. Do not waste your money on this game.			"

												What can I say about x-rebirth? Well..lets get started1) If you are familiar with how the orginal x games played you will be disappointed, this game is nothing like them.(HA THATS IT FOR THE NUMBERS!)Anyways, x-rebirth to me is a very enjoyable game to play, but thats WITH mods. IF you are reading this as a player debating on buying it or someone returning please please please go to the egosoft modding forums and download cwir, you'll actually get to activly partipacte in a war raging in all sectors of space, theyres tons of player additions that make this game what it should have beenso, bottom line.Vanilla x-rebirth? I honestly couldnt say as I haven't played it in years.Modded x-rebith? A blast and with the steam workshop support also making it extremly easy to use. *note* the egosoft forums are the best place to find some big mods :)			"

												After one year of public development this game got to completely another level. From unplayable trash it promoted into very fine piece with awesome graphics and still improving gameplay.If you have a look on egosoft forums, you will discover that most of hating posts are because players lack knowledge and fantasy how to handle different game scenarios.Sure, game lacks commands handling big units, but with little bit of creativity you can handle some situations and a lot of new stuff is coming in next patch.As all egosoft games, this game had (and still has few of them) issues, but with time its improving and I certainly do not regret of money I have put in it.I can sincerely recommend this game to all lovers of singleplayer space simulators aimed not only for shooting, but for building and trading as well.

												I've never bothered writing a review before, but this was such a bad game that I felt if I could stop someone else from wasting their money I would. This screams console game...and a bad one at that. It's pretty, but pointless and cumbersome. They took everything that made the other X games great, and threw them out the window. Then they added fancy window dressing to said window and called it a new game. I'd rather have moderate graphics and great game play, than great graphics and no game play. I don't see how this will be salvaged, even once the bugs are fixed.SAVE YOUR MONEY. BUY A VERSION OF X3...it's light years ahead of this in it's fun and playability. I've spent hundreds of hours on X3, I doubt I'll ever spend a single hour on this...			"

												This game got off to a shaky start, but as all Egosoft games it got patched up and became highly enjoyable!Has advertised it is quite a different take to the Empire building flight sim of previous X games, yes there are currently some features from past games missing.

												I bought this game hoping for an experience similar to the beloved old Freelancer. Not the case.Voice acting is brutal, campaign is tough to get into, and the HUD controls from the ship are bad. A lot of the features and button presses seem only to work intermittently.

												I really like the game with the new 3.0 Patch/dlc.Egosoft fixed all the technical problems i had with update 2.5 and now they added features i really wanted to have (outside of squad trading,ordering stuff to your ship etc.). I would say even if the patching took some time, now the game is a lot fun to play. Only thing I miss a bit is that there are no Borons in the game.I always loved them in X3.However they do not really fit to the lore so I can live with it.			"

												I never played an ""X"" game before, which will make this review of more use to those of you who also haven't and just want to know if this is a good game, and less use to those of you who have, and want to know how it stacks up to its predecessors. I thought I might start with an anecdote.Tasked with building a space station in an ally's territory, I only needed about 60 fusion reactors to complete it. I searched every sector for it, but nobody was selling. I soon found out why: these were only being produced at 3 stations and my enemy, the Plutarch Corporation, owned one of those and was buying every reactor that came off the production lines at the others. So what's a poor rebel to do?Raid their shipments, obviously.I waited several kilometers away from one of the factories with my cargo freighter standing by. After seeing a Plutarch ship dock and then pull away, I scanned its cargo, revealing that it was carrying my coveted fusion reactors, I made my move.I used my dumbfire rockets to quickly disable its engines and warp drive, then went to work on the main hull. This was a long process but I found a safe spot just behind the engines where I could go to recharge my shields. Woe to the unwary freighter that travels without fighter escort.The freighter destroyed, I tagged the cargo for my own cargo ship to pick up. As a swarm of drones buzzed toward the remains, I spotted a Plutarch destroyer in the distance. Several seconds later it was apparent that it was headed straight for me, most likely in response to my little Space Pirate schtick. I had no means to fight a destroyer, but I did tangle with the wing of fighters it sent ahead of itself in order to protect my cargo drones. As the last drone made it safely into the cargo bay, the destroyer began to open up on my freighter. It's a hardy vessel but it wouldn't last long under that hailstorm of fire. I ordered the captain of the freighter to get us out of there, then swung my craft around to the front, briefly exposing myself to the destroyer's fire to dock. I watched from the deck as lasers streaked across the sky and missiles exploded against the hull, hearing the faint sound of the frieghter's jump drive charging up. Moments later, explosions were replaced by silence. The jump had taken me and my freighter hundreds of thousands of kilometers away, with our precious reactors safely aboard (and with no load screen in between).I chose this little anecdote because it perfectly encapsulates X: Rebirth's interacting systems of trade, construction, and combat. But I neglected to mention a few details.During this whole scenario, I encountered a massive drop in framerate that persisted until I left the zone and returned. The game crashed inexplicably some time after I transferred my wares. I originally tried boarding the freighter, but found that while 8 marines was plenty to take a destroyer in an earlier story mission, a full complement of 50 marines was totally incapable later on of capturing even a much smaller freighter than my target. The station repeatedly reminded me that my rash behavior ""isn't tolerated in these parts,"" but apparently forgot to attach a consequence to their threats. Even now I can trade with that station as with any other. And the whole excursion was made necessary because my previous shipment of some 114 fusion reactors inexplicably disappeared from the freighter's cargo holds--the freighter made it, the goods didn't. It still had the order to transfer the wares to my construction ship in its queue. Upon deleting and reissuing the order, a message told me that it had no fusion reactors in its holds. Gone into thin air.My point is this: At its best, X: Rebirth is the most full-featured, exciting, strategic space sim available that I know of. Though dogfights are a little awkward because the smaller spacecraft are so maneuverable, combat overall is exceptionally exciting. The game has made me think in terms of real logic (how can I acquire this good by any means available) as opposed to game logic (how can I exploit this system to get 1000x as much as I'll ever need). It appears, so far as I can tell, that the entire game is driven by a real economy: goods cannot be used until they're produced, and producing these goods means someone has to mine them, extract them, refine them, and manufacture them. This creates a living world unlike any I've ever seen before, and when I close my trade console and nudge my throttle forward (I use a Saitek X52 joystick) towards the next station, or merge into a highway and switch on the auto-pilot while I give orders to my fleet, I really feel like I am there, interacting with a real world in space. Seeing a station suddenly pop into view as I exit the space highway, or docking on one of my larger vessels while it jumps me across space (with no loading screens!) are experiences that just never get old.At its worst, X: Rebirth continues to sport more bugs and headaches than are really excusable, especially with it being the fourth iteration in the series. You will encounter glitches. Your framerate will inexplicably drop to a crawl (only happened to me twice in 24 hours play though). You will experience crashes (save often). The story dialogue is fair, but most of the other conversations and text might have actually been written by a third grader (hearing a Marine Officer randomly chirp, valley-girl style, ""Eww, slimy green lizardy things are everywhere!"" is just bizarre, and some of the logbook entries are so poorly written as to be indecipherable). The game does not explain itself very thoroughly, and you will spend much time trying to figure out how many of its systems work (or don't work, as is occasionally the case).I had great anticipation for this game's release, so I was very disappointed when I read that it was basically an unfinished product. The free weekend just recently spoke a great deal about the developer's confidence in the current state of their product, and I believe that confidence is justified. This is now a very playable, fully-featured game, and if you are patient and have a good tolerance for the occasional bug, it can give you some of the most fantastic gaming experiences you've had in years.

												Final Verdict: 4.12 / 101 - Stability / Engine6/10There have been a couple complaints about FPS drops and crashes.That makes me come to the conclusion, that there are some compatiblity issues, but the majority of players seems to be able to play the game at normal framerates and crashfree.I myself am using a Radeon HD 7970 and experienced a couple frame rate drops here and there, but until now I didn't have anything dramatic happening to me and I'm playing at pretty high settings.There are no hardware caused bugs like graphic bugs, in this perspective it runs without any problems.Things that do stop my gameplay and have me lose the progress since my last manual save are UI-Bugs.I got stuck in the trading menu with the ""save"" option turned off. The game kept running, but I couldn't close the menu so I had to quit and start over with an old savegame.Another bug is that if you dock on a big carrier with having it's docking platform outside you might experience the carrier flying through everything. It just glitches through the giant space stations as if they aren't there. You better watch your step when going back to your ship.I do not wish to have these bugs influence the score too much because Egosoft used to fix such bugs in previous titles.2 - Gameplay2.1 Learning Curve:3/10The game is once again extremely hard to learn how to play.I take the risk and dare to say it is far harder to understand the game than in previous titles.While previous titles like ""X3 Albion Prelude"" had icons and colourful effects at every space station and ship telling you ""Hey here's a quest!"" or ""I'm taking damage!"" X Rebirth doesn't have that.They wanted to make the gaming experience more intuitive but they did that on the cost of obviousness.As a new player and even as an experienced player of every single previous title you have absolutely no idea what to do or how to actually do it.This comes along with a problem with the UI: it doesn't scale with the resolution!At a for today very normal resolution of 1920:1080 your UI becomes so tiny that it's absolutely not the player's fault if they miss something.The tutorial uses the same lines as the subtitles.Eventhough there is no text overlapping it is still a very bad idea, especially because you constantly get tutorial messages for just piloting the ship during the normal gameplay.2.2 - Human Gameplay1/10During the gameplay it is necessary to stand up from your seat and walk through your tiny ship or some tiny levels that resemble the interriors of a space station.I don't even want to pick on the fact that you don't seem to have a body yourself, what's far worse is that you run through the stations with far too high speed.You can barely interact with your environment and the interactions that are actually there feel very clumsy and poorly designed.It is clear that the development team or the game engine itself is not capable of implementing an organic gameplay within a space game.Together with 3.1, 4.1 and 4.2 the human gameplay is rather a huge bother than an enjoyable side experience.The human gameplay is a requirement to play the game properly and overall I'd say it has the level of the worst games that infect the market with their low-quality rip-off poison, I've seen super-low budget games that did a better job, I'm sorry to say.2.3 - Ship Gameplay5/10I'm pretty nice here because I see the little details they added to the franchise over time.Your ship doesn't just ""turn"" if you move your mouse, it drifts into the previous direction, till your accelleration overcomes the former vector.You can see your actual speed in real time, there is no restriction when it comes to flying around.I do see the relative speed they added to the game, so you don't get crushed by a carrier, while you're flying inside its docking area or anything.I do see that they really did put some effort into it.But the ship gameplay is not just the 360° controls, it's also the interaction with your environment and that's where the score dies.To interact with a station you have to fly really close to its hovering icon.Often you find yourself clicking and clicking and just not getting that stupid icon to highlight.If you concentrate too much on keeping the icon in the center of your crosshair you will find yourself crashing into the station with mach1 or faster (that doesn't sound healthy).Since they removed the targeting system you're usually left having absolutely no idea where your ships are.At the beginning of the story mode you get a large trading ship, but I couldn't find it!I had no idea how to get to it.It was on my sector map, but I could only get a rough idea of where it must be, I couldn't highlight it.When I finally found it I had to go to the front of the ship to be able to access the docking menu.Being 10m away from a big moving obstacle and moving to it with the speed of sound is a BAD COMBINATION.Aside from that I did notice that the ships you meet in the highway are just there for the minigame.If you leave the highway through its gate none of those ships come out, and there are a lot of ships in there.Previous titles told you when an enemy gets into or out of your weapon's reach, now you have no idea when to shoot.The distances are less detailed now, you only get kilometer displays.2.4 - Menus and Control Panels2/10I wished there was anything enjoyable but not even the main menu feels good.You have to switch to arrow keys + enter/esc to use the menu properly.Mouse input doesn't work very well since you often don't know if the game actually took the double click or not.There are a lot of issues with things like the trading menu.While I already transferred the bugs to the stability rating, the menu also feels unintuitive.I had no idea who trades with whom and in which direction the wares are going.The few menus and control panels that are present are a bother to use!And it's not just what's there: It's also what's not there.I have the strong feeling that the game would have been better off with far more control panels than that.The ""intuitive gameplay"" is a huge failure and without a proper control interface with a high grade of obviousity you cannot play the game properly.3 - Graphics3.1 - Human Character Models1/10During the gameplay you will soon notice the incredibly ugly character models.Most humans you meet look so old, you'll be afraid they drop dead any second.Aside from the age they look like their parents were very sad fishes.http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/469793673227446070/40D404604FC504953A6296C198E7CC544F400BA5/3.2 - Human Animations1/10The models are also barely animated.No mocap studio was used for those animations, and you will definately see that.The animations are extremely rudimentary.It is very obvious that someone doesn't know how to rig clothing to a mesh, so you'll often see hats and glasses move differently than the bodypart they are attached to.Also often animations don't fit together and lead to weird dislocations.3.3 - Ship and Station Models6/10I'm sorry to give this such a low rating, because most ships look very beautiful, especially the larger ones.Same goes to the majority of the station models.What's a bother though is that not all of the models look good.Actually some of the models have an incredibly low polygon count for the fact that during the normal gameplay you have to stare at them closeup.Aside from that many parts of the space stations are made of alpha-textures instead of 3D models.You often get to see really ugly flat pictures instead of beautiful 3D models, and they will ♥♥♥♥ your eyes until you hate the game.3.4 - Textures and Effects4/10Some textures look pretty nice and the effect quality is very high.You're often stunned by the beauty of the environment ...But the rest of the textures real			"

												It has more bugs than working features. The devs say they are trying to fix things, but it is now almost three months old and it lokks as if they are just unable to. They deliberately let noone playtest before release because they knew that this game should have been scrapped instead of released, but they needed the money so they conned their fans.			"

												I was pretty excited for this game. The idea of free-roam in space, picking up jobs, being able to trade and other promised features were extremely exciting. I hadn't played previous X games, but I was really excited to dive into the series with this offering.One word. Extremely disappointing. Missing features, features that don't work.... DO NOT BUY.

												I really gave this game a good solid try but I feel it is unplayable due to the lack of a trading system. I have a fleet of ships and I cant keep track of them. I dont know which ship can buy what. I can not send them to pick up wares to build my space station because they can't pick up the goods for some reason. I cant find the wares that I need.  If its not one thing it is another. If I remove a ship from my squad the AI should be set for them to go make money for me... I also HATE the short hair and ugliness of all the NPC characters. I want to hire some hot b*&#ches for my space crew not old hags! Great concept, I really did enjoy the ships and graphics and I flew around and randomly shot stuff for awhile but that got boring and I wanted to build my empire but just couldnt due to the above items. In short see my picture, I give this game the F*%&^ing finger!			"

												This game was the one thing I spent the entire year looking forward to. It was also the one thing that crushed my expectations to a fine, powdery substance. If you at all enjoyed the previous games in the X series, DO NOT touch this with a ten foot pole. The developers used first day buyers as unaware beta testers. The game glitches horribly, it has an incredibly counter-intuitive UI. You have no ability to fly any ships other than your starter one. While an OK (not great, or even good, but OK) space sim on its own, the developers have really stabbed their fans in the back with this monstrosity. I would pay maybe $10 for it on a good day, and that's if I could convince myself that it's not really an X game before buying.			"

												Waited so long for this and it turned out to be utter rubbish. Gorgeous visuals spoilt by retro graphic cockpit that cant be turned off. Full of bugs, more bugs and still more bugs. Every space station is the same as the last, every dull conversation is the same as the last. I thought the fact that it was X years late would make it special when actually it needed another X years to get ready for release. Poor, very poor.			"

												What an incredible disappointment.  I loved the X Series, and this one promised to get away from the menu micromanagement that dominated the previous games and be more immersive, which was about my only complaint.  So I am excited to start playing this, and I was amazed at how true it was.  I start out roaming an asteroid field looking for this concept ship that was space's equivalent to Gran Turismo's X-Racer, a ship so ridiculously outperforming and expensive that only the one was ever made and no fleet could afford it.But then the first disappointment.  The devs, for reasons I will never understand, decided to call the ship the Albion Skunk...  They wrote in storyline that you catch during load screens that the name was the Albion Pride but someone hacked the ship's registry and changed it's name, which is pretty weak to me.  And of course, your character sticks with the name because nothing boosts a guy's pride in his super rare, super powerful ship like naming it after an animal synonymous with garbage heaps.  And then while he's trying to get the ship working, he is boarded and his new copilot is introduced.Bad storyline out of the way, I'm ready to rock and roll, and thank god this new lady is some genius engineer because after a few console commands and slaps to the console, we've got engines, boosters, weapons, and other basic functionality.  After a quick ""getting your feet wet"" dogfight, we land at a station and I once again get to awe at the scope they tried to achieve. Flying around the outer portion of this station are hundreds upon hundreds of ships in line to dock at the numerous facilities the station has to offer. Thankfully, everyone realizes that I am the player, and damnit my time is important, because my slipping through to the front of the line does not get anyone all frisky with the trigger.  Even the cops are all, ""Carry on, dude!"" as they fly by.I dock and am rewarded with the ability to get out of my ship and wander the space station, various little junk sellable pickups everywhere to make things interesting, and dozens of occupants buying and selling, offering to become pilots or other crew for your ship, or ships you will eventually get.  I do my business and take off, continuing on the storyline mission.  More shooting, and I get to dock at an old frieghter.  Again I get to get out of my ship and explore, and I'm wandering the cargo area of this frieghter.  I can see out the airlock forcefield in the back to space and watch the ship as it moves.  At this point I am floored by how great this game is.Fast forward through a few missions, I am already growing bored.  Docking with a ship gives you one ""wander area"" with one of something like 4 backdrops.  Even the little loot boxes are all in the same spots. And contain usually the same things.  Junk that'll sell for a couple credits, nothing that will get you anywhere financially, though, if you can even find the guy to sell it.  Space stations are not much better.  It looks like they took the same few space station building modules in a level editor and plugged them together in 3 or 4 different configurations, and after about an hour of work, they called it good.Another gameplay aspect is scanning the space station exterior, ostensibly to find out how the whole thing functions.  And when you get the whole thing scanned, you get a pretty decent stationwide discount and bonus to what you sell.  But this becomes extremely tedious as you are looking for the last module that you can see with your scanners that you haven't scanned, but the little question mark you need to get close to won't appear until you look at it from a very specific angle. Ahh frustration, hell with it, moving on.  You can also get these little hacker drones that you remotely pilot to various points around a station or ship within a certain time to hack them and supposedly take control of the ship, force it to dump its cargo, force better deals at the stations, etc.  It doesn't do any of that.  It is a neat stealth gameplay that forces you to hide from patrolling cops but there is no benefit.  You finish the hack and the game tells you you've completed it.  That is it.  No reward whatsoever.  It was like they planned to have it but never got around to finishing it.Short version:The game started out pretty good but quickly devolved into a game that looked like it was rushed out the door months before it should have been.  I did not cover all of the different things you can do in the game, but the review was long enough as it is.  I recommend staying away from this game, though.  The amount of time I spent in it before getting bored, several hours actually, is way above par.  Most people I talk to gave it about 15 minutes and called it quits.			"

												This is not X.I know that Egosoft tried to reinvent the X universe with this release, but what they appear to have done is akin to chopping off all of a person's limbs and calling it the next step in human evolution, sure it's different and not what we expected, but it's a completely stupid idea where the only positive thing you can say is that at least they will save money on gloves, socks and shoes.X Rebirth has none of the magic of the previous X games and the only thing I can try to say that is positive is that the concept of the space highways is interesting, if poorly implemented.With X you are supposed to Trade Fight Build and Think. The only thinking I did was ""What the hell have you done with an IP I love?""If you want X stick to X Albion Prelude.			"

												A terribly dissapointing release that seems to freeze or crash in a different way each time it's played.  In scale it might be compared to Skyrim, with its impressively large playable area, but X Rebirth lacks any significant diversity within that space.  A small handful of NPC models are cut and pasted throughout identical locations.  Even when unique characters are encountered, their dialog is confused and poorly voice-acted.  And without the option of skipping dialog, in any situation, the repeatitiveness of the characters and situations is compounded.While there is an enjoyable aspect to navigating the bustling space around lovely stations, in beautifully rendered external environments, these potential strengths are mitigated by a horribly muddled UI which includes the claustrophobic and largely non-interactive cockpit of your ship, only a very small portion of which offers any useful information for navigation or combat.As a whole, X Rebirth is a largely broken, badly designed, low-concept product that could use, at minimum, another year in development and a full UI overhaul.  Fans of the series might find the experience worthwhile, but the rest of the gaming community will likely find time and money better spent in Eve.			"

												Even without all the bugs and performance problems, what we have is a very bad game that is poorly designed. It will take you hours upon hours of maneuvering through convoluted gameplay mechanics and glitches just to find out how shallow the game really is. It has taken them ""7"" years to shovel this garbage out the door. A space sim(?) in which joystick/HOTAS support are held together with scotch tape, no physics (like all X games, it feels like moving around in spectator mode from Counter-Strike 1.5), no freelook (much less TrackIR), no radar, no target filtering, etc. In short - it is a big mess.Some might say it was a failed console game, and by Egosofts own admission they had it working on the Xbox 360 and would love nothing more than to have had X Rebirth as a console game. Instead, they vomited this out on to the PC. I suspect even Microsoft didn't want anything to do with it's poor quality and turned them down.I wouldn't bother waiting for it to get fixed, either. X Rebirth feels like a ""last hurrah"" to cash out of the business before Star Citizen and Elite Dangerous carry the space sim genre for the next decade. And we will all be better off for it.TRADE: Broken and cumbersome. Lacks information that should be easily accessible. Fly around convoluted space stations and pick up trade offers that only last an hour. Waterboard yourself as you wait 30 minutes for your transport ship to fly to the station and break while trying to complete an order.FIGHT: Incredibly shallow. Fixed view to make you nauseous and you're unable to look around. Cockpit takes up 40% of the screen. No radar or target filtering of any kind. Not even going to go into the AI.BUILD: Broken with an incredible lack of information letting you know wtf is going on or what you're doing wrong/how to do it in the first place. What can you build? AN EMPIRE!? Yeah, sure....some more stations to do more broken trading.THINK: You got that right. You'll spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to do basic things only to find out that they are convoluted or don't exist in the first place. Scratch your head in wonder while asking yourself how this garbage could make it out to retail. Be in awe with the slapped together design decisions. Dabble into the world of conspiracy theories at X Rebirths suspicious release timing just ahead of Star Citizen and Elite Dangerous.			"

												X rebirth is what you get when you take past X games, arguably take the best parts of those games and add a full body avatar to them. The game starts off good but you will find that there are a ton of bugs present in the initial launch game. The game is a pretty good space sim, and extremely detailed. Lots of ships are flying about, space cities and stations that span several kilometers and have intricate workings. Lots to see and lots to do. the same can be said for fights with capital ships, no longer are these behemoths large bludgions that will kill your ship when they as much as take a right turn if you happen to be in their way. And instead of just attacking them to dwindle down their HP, they now have actual hard-points on board that can be destroyed, often after you get past the shield generator that protects them. Destroy the engines, jump drive and docking bay ports can render a ship incapable of defending itsself. But get too close or in line of sight with its AA batteries and there will be hell to pay. Large scale battles between multiple capital ships can be a sight to behold. Small ships on the other hand will swoop around larger objects and seek you out, through they can be easy to kill with the right weaponry.It is certain to say that the combat mechanics of X-rebirth are certainly an improvement.Unfortunately this can not be said about some of its other main mechanics, and this is mostly due to bugs... Lots and lots of bugs...------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Minor bugs that take you out of the game: Like crouching characters and falling through the floor when spawning.- Annoying bugs & behaviour such as: Icons and triggers not loading for at least half a minute after undocking, or the fact that you often need perfect line of sight to see missions. Or being unable to buy items at discount because you can't afford the the item at full price.- Major game breaking bugs such as: Ships that were impounded not being returned to you after a mission is complete, deleting them from the game. Trade ships not functioning like they should, getting stuck.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Another problem is both the games strength and weakness, SATA, (the time skipping feature used to speed up the game) has been removed. Instead, you will now find highways, high speed routes that cross entire sectors. These highways function great for getting around, (as long as there is traffic on them, otherwise you're still very slow). When off the highways you now have a boost feature (partially to replace SATA) this boost allows you to rapidly accelerate, but in exchange it drains your shields. Its a great feature, but shouldn't be used too much in combat.Initially and AFAIK there is no fast travel to speak of. I suspect you'll be able to hitch a ride later on a capital ship with a jump drive, but I can't say for sure if this is player controled, or just a part of specific missions. Unfortunatly, capital ships seem to lack the boost feature. Meaning that you will often have to wait several minutes for your trade ship to complete its docking procedure after it jumps into the area, something SATA in previous games so nicely circumvented.This is compounded by the sheer size of the game world. Finding a character that sells you something can be a chore or even worse, and this is all because even though the game world is suppose to be defined, the merchants and NPC's, besides the terminals you buy and sell bulk goods from are all randomly generated. So if a character gives you a recommendation for a certain mechanic (npc) with very good stats, that npc won't be there the next time you dock.Characters, like any other installment of the X series, look like they are either 70 years old, or had a serious cosmetic accident. And the voice acting, while not terrible, has some of the worst writing I've ever heard. Don't even get me started on the small talk feature.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In conclusion, I guess the campaign is decent, if somewhat stale. Most of the tasks you are asked to do are default sandbox cookie cutter missions such as, Find NPC, Buy/Sell, Deliver, Kill, Scan, Mine, etc. Unfortunately, the few that I found that are unique and contain story telling tend to be quite buggy. The first 5 hours are spend teaching you the ropes on how to play the game. This makes the campaign just a tutorial for the sandbox mode. My advice to people who are considering this game, WAIT.The game is fun to play, if it works... but right now there are too many things broken.Luckily, if EGOSOFT has one saving grace, its that they are pretty good at patching their games. At this time they have already released 20 patches. Give it half a year to a year, pick it up during a steam sale and have the experience this game was suppose to have at launch...			"

One example is the explorable stations and ships.

Most of the game's good ideas are exactly like that. Even with the bugs fixed I wouldn't recommend it.			"

Some scenes are actually quite beautiful. On the other hand, the fps will drop through the floor for no apparent reason.If you can get past these flaws, you will soon realize that unlike other ""space sims"" this game simulates nothing! There is no real economy, not a single ship is persistant or remotely connected to the world, and frankly, nothing you do will ever be reflected in the world around you.			"

												I've played several of the other X series games and, while difficult to learn, they turned out to be enjoyable. This one however is certainly not worth the time or money.  EGO took everything cool and fun about the previous games and threw it away. The breathing taking views of space, planetary bodies, and ships are still there, but they added trivial mini games like the space hightways, ugly NPCs and horrible interior areas that make the game tedious and not worth playing. Spend your money elsewhere.UPDATE (9-12-14): Ego has released the 2.5 BETA 7 patch as an opt in. I've noticed that the patch has improved stability, the menu system, and I can talk to vendors and other NPCs without boarding. Patch details show that its supposed to fix a bunch of other stuff too, but I haven't gotten to those yet. I've still managed to get the game to crash a few times, and you are still stuck in a single ship (we knew that at purchase), but overall, I have to give EGO credit for their efforts in improving this game.

												One of the most disappointing sequels in recent memory. If the game launched as an early access title, I could understand it being barebones and crashing. Unfortunately they're charging $50 and act as though it's feature complete. I could go into all that is wrong with the game, but there are plenty of reviews on here that do it already. If you're hankering for a great space sim, X3: Albion Prelude is still the best.			"

												After 19 patches, I'm still unable to proceed with the campaign as there is still a 100% blocker (many users still have this one).The frame rate is still aweful that it's not even playable (5-10 fps as an average) and I have a very good rig, I can run ARMA 3 at high with consistent 40 fps (60 at medium with textures at very high).This is by far the worse game I've ever bought and I'm very upset to have pre-order for this. It shouldn't even have release with the current state of the game. And Steam nor Egosoft want to refund. That's a well wasted 50$.			"

												This was an impulse purchase for me, I had never heard of the ""X"" series before I bought this game. While most negative reviews here consist of betrayed ""X"" series fans venting, this review will focus on the gamebreaking bugs/problems.Where to start...I preordered this game one day before it released, from the little snippets of information I could find it looked like a cross between Descent Freespace, Imperium Galactica II, and Sins of a solar Empire.1st person combat in space with a living economy that can be exploited for your gain? Why not?It'd been a few years since I've found a good space sim and was hoping that this one would fill the gap.Installed it and booted up the game, but I couldn't actually start a game without it locking up at the loading screen. After a quick google search I found a fix, I had to lower the sound quality on my sound card...odd to say the least.The space combat was amazing! Graphics were spectacular! Textures were pretty low res on the stations.Now for the bulk of why I recommend you don't buy this game, or at least wait until they fix it. 6+ months from now?Game breaking bugs! I mean really game breaking, CTD, halting progression, raising your blood pressure bugs.They have this cinematic whenever you enter the cockpit, your chair turns towards you and you sit down and it turns back. That's great and all until it breaks and the chair doesn't turn to you, but not only is that broken, everything useful you pull up from this panel that comes popping up from the side is. Only it doesn't if the chair breaks, so you get stuck looking 90 degrees to the right with no options to get out of that view because the only way to cancel it is to hit the ""x"" that is on the panel that never came up! *restart game*At one point in the game you have to have a cargo carrier of yours deliver power cells. 100 to be exact, out of a 100,000 capactity carrier. Not only does that seem like an absurd waste of time, it has the potential to block you from ever progressing. Once ordered to trade, you cannot cancel the order. Pathing is broken so your carrier might just keep ramming against the station. Or it could fly a few thousand KM away from the station, only to turn around and fly back. Once it actually docks with the station, it might never complete the trade. It will just float there forever. You have to edit your save file to remove the ship from the trade que. *exit game and edit XML files with notepad++*Corrupted saves! Lost seven hours of gameplay because it crashed after I entered a Space Highway.The highways are a gimmick that should have never been added, you have to play bumper tag with the other ships that enter to get a speed boost. Only problem is that sometimes ships never enter so you are stuck at slow speed for the next five minutes. That and you might get kicked out of the highway for no reason what-so-ever, so have fun flying a few hundred thousand KM back to civilization since you can't enter the highway again. *Load game that may or may not be recent*Economy is not what I would call living. Trading is more likely to break your game and takes such an absurdly long time for your ship to go from point A to point B that you can make more money, faster, flying to stations and trading rockets.The devs boasted that you can blow up/capture a cargo carrier full of *insert item here* and watch the prices spike since the supply is now lower than the demand. Either A. They lied. Or B. The game is so broken that it never registered that I vaporized the cargo after I destroyed the ship that carried it.You can just capture a battleship and pawn it off for around 120m credits, that really made trading null so I don't know why they bothered. *Just blow it all up!*Sometimes the game will enable a ""noclip"" function, you can fly and shoot straight through everything! While amusing for a bit, it becomes less so when you are trying to escort a ship and the mission fails because your projectiles go through the enemy fighters, thus allowing them to blow up the escorted ship at their leisure. Only way to cancel the bug is to reload, which fails the mission anyways, so GG. *try not to cry*Framrate likes to take a dive in this game, especially at highways. Apparently it was a big problem for most people, some people would get 20 frames regardless. I was lucky to be running at 60+, until they put out a patch and it crawled to 25. I'm not using a potato to play this game either. They seriously broke it.There are more, but seriously, the list goes on and on and on. I played 50 hours of this mess.Along with the scores of little bugs that just either break immersion or break whatever else I can't recommend buying this.After really, really wanting to like this game, I found it to be an exercise in frustration. Joke is on me for getting the CE for a game I didn't know jack about. "

												What an incredible disappointment.  I loved the X Series, and this one promised to get away from the menu micromanagement that dominated the previous games and be more immersive, which was about my only complaint.  So I am excited to start playing this, and I was amazed at how true it was.  I start out roaming an asteroid field looking for this concept ship that was space's equivalent to Gran Turismo's X-Racer, a ship so ridiculously outperforming and expensive that only the one was ever made and no fleet could afford it.But then the first disappointment.  The devs, for reasons I will never understand, decided to call the ship the Albion Skunk...  They wrote in storyline that you catch during load screens that the name was the Albion Pride but someone hacked the ship's registry and changed it's name, which is pretty weak to me.  And of course, your character sticks with the name because nothing boosts a guy's pride in his super rare, super powerful ship like naming it after an animal synonymous with garbage heaps.  And then while he's trying to get the ship working, he is boarded and his new copilot is introduced.Bad storyline out of the way, I'm ready to rock and roll, and thank god this new lady is some genius engineer because after a few console commands and slaps to the console, we've got engines, boosters, weapons, and other basic functionality.  After a quick ""getting your feet wet"" dogfight, we land at a station and I once again get to awe at the scope they tried to achieve. Flying around the outer portion of this station are hundreds upon hundreds of ships in line to dock at the numerous facilities the station has to offer. Thankfully, everyone realizes that I am the player, and damnit my time is important, because my slipping through to the front of the line does not get anyone all frisky with the trigger.  Even the cops are all, ""Carry on, dude!"" as they fly by.I dock and am rewarded with the ability to get out of my ship and wander the space station, various little junk sellable pickups everywhere to make things interesting, and dozens of occupants buying and selling, offering to become pilots or other crew for your ship, or ships you will eventually get.  I do my business and take off, continuing on the storyline mission.  More shooting, and I get to dock at an old frieghter.  Again I get to get out of my ship and explore, and I'm wandering the cargo area of this frieghter.  I can see out the airlock forcefield in the back to space and watch the ship as it moves.  At this point I am floored by how great this game is.Fast forward through a few missions, I am already growing bored.  Docking with a ship gives you one ""wander area"" with one of something like 4 backdrops.  Even the little loot boxes are all in the same spots. And contain usually the same things.  Junk that'll sell for a couple credits, nothing that will get you anywhere financially, though, if you can even find the guy to sell it.  Space stations are not much better.  It looks like they took the same few space station building modules in a level editor and plugged them together in 3 or 4 different configurations, and after about an hour of work, they called it good.Another gameplay aspect is scanning the space station exterior, ostensibly to find out how the whole thing functions.  And when you get the whole thing scanned, you get a pretty decent stationwide discount and bonus to what you sell.  But this becomes extremely tedious as you are looking for the last module that you can see with your scanners that you haven't scanned, but the little question mark you need to get close to won't appear until you look at it from a very specific angle. Ahh frustration, hell with it, moving on.  You can also get these little hacker drones that you remotely pilot to various points around a station or ship within a certain time to hack them and supposedly take control of the ship, force it to dump its cargo, force better deals at the stations, etc.  It doesn't do any of that.  It is a neat stealth gameplay that forces you to hide from patrolling cops but there is no benefit.  You finish the hack and the game tells you you've completed it.  That is it.  No reward whatsoever.  It was like they planned to have it but never got around to finishing it.Short version:The game started out pretty good but quickly devolved into a game that looked like it was rushed out the door months before it should have been.  I did not cover all of the different things you can do in the game, but the review was long enough as it is.  I recommend staying away from this game, though.  The amount of time I spent in it before getting bored, several hours actually, is way above par.  Most people I talk to gave it about 15 minutes and called it quits.			"

												If you are a fan of previous games in the X series then you need to read heavily about the current in-game features of X Rebirth before purchasing. If you are on the fence, I heavily vote DON'T DO IT.If you are a fan of games that actually work without bugs, run on your computer, don't crash, and would be considered by most to be a full release, then don't buy this game for a few months.If you are desperate for a pretty Freelancer rip-off with a little bit of station-owning and broken trading mechanics, and have absolutely no patience, then I guess you could buy this... but you're better off buying something else for less money and waiting to see if this game becomes playable by Q2 2014.

												The only positive thing that can be said for X Rebirth is that graphically, it’s a beautiful game…When in space.Other than that, this game has no redeeming qualities.Game mechanics that make no sense.Some of the worst voice acting I've heard in a long time.Very limited voice dialogue as it is.For a futuristic game that features faster than light space travel, your computers are pretty useless.Ai path finding is a joke.Some bugs require you to hack your save file to fix.Overall, this game feels like an early alpha release… with a very long way to.Unfortunately, I suspect we will get a few more months of patches to fix bugs and then Egosoft will drop support for this game.If I ever buy an EgoSoft game again, it will be after it has been released and reviewed as a good game.Never again will I pre-order from them.

												Terrible, badly designed game.Clearly worse than the previous game in this series, and in need of a lot of development work that just does not appear to be getting done.Avoid at all costs.Examples: *Interacting with stations is now done by flying around the station looking for icons that may or may not be the station service/person you're looking for. Stations can have multiple different docking locations, shops inside and outside docking locations, multiple levels inside docking locations, and NPCs are not easily findable. You often have to ask other NPCs to help you find the NPC you're looking for, and they will usually tell you to sod off (really, they do).*Waypoint navigation is confusing at best, game suffers from the same limited-time missions as before, but now it's twice as hard to figure out where to go. I spent 4 of the first taxi mission's 5 minutes circling the area I was being told there was a docking location at. After the mission expired, I may have found one near, but in a ship not actually attached to, the station highlighted by the waypoint.*Voice acting is bad, whole game is now voiced, you must speak to NPCs on a regular basis. One is on your ship.*Needless walking from place to place with an half-♥♥♥♥♥ feeling first person mode.*Pointless item hunting, suddenly space stations leaving loot in boxes everwhere, which you steal. Some hidden in airducts...because that makes sense. Entirely out of genre trope, and the trope doesn't really make sense in the correct games.*Main questline still buggy - decided to quit after being told to sell energy cubes to a station, sold more cubes than the quest expected and it ignored it and expected me to go back and get more cubes so I could sell *exactly* 100 cubes to the target station...

												Too many bugs. The idea of the game seems fun and I'm really trying, but I have to fight the interface (worse than prior X games) every time I want to do a task. Submenus upon submenus upon submenus, under the menu, only to find that's not the right place to send a fleet command for your non-combat ships to stop following, even though you were looking for fleet commands. Missions are fairly broken as well, you will need to do save game editing to fix/get past some of them. In fact, I'm stuck on selling 300 Food to some station in Fervid something as they won't seem to accept any of the 5,000 Food I've picked up in my Construction Vessel nor a Lepton that has precisely 300 Food on it. Neither of those ships will complete the trade with the mission station. I've heard that I have to buy the 300 Food from a specific station, but the mission never mentions it and the mission ""briefs"" are just that, brief and uninformative.The walking around in stations is a huge waste of time and is often laggier than being out in space. Trying to do trades in the game is a joke, especially if it's a trade for a mission, your ships will often get ""stuck"" traveling between systems or even wandering aimlessly around a station and never dock, like its supposed to, to start the trade. I've watched one of my ships (Construction Vessel) dock twice at the correct port, only to never unload its cargo and instead immediately undock. This game is an endless series of frustrations with a few glimmers of joy.I almost forgot to mention your singular ship that you fly, which can only have one gun of a certain type (plasma, mining, etc.) ""active"" at a-a-time, you cannot have, say, four plasma cannons all blasting away. The only way to upgrade your weapon is to upgrade that one weapon to a strong version. Also, any time you open a menu while your ship is flying, your ship will STOP. So don't even think about multi-tasking while flying to some distant object, even for a brief moment. All forward momentum will immediately cease.Oh, and yes you can capture ships, but only to sell them. In theory you can fly the ships, but as part of your boarding process you destroy the jump engines and drives, which makes the ship incapable of moving and there's no way to repair the ship if it doesn't already have Construction URV drones on it. Some ships don't even have drone bays and it's only a random chance (I have yet to see any included Construction URV drones after capturing 9 vessels) that they would pre-exist. You then put an Engineer on the ship which randomly (or you edited your save game) has Construction URV drones who then may, or may not, repair the ship. I have three Balor class ships sitting around with engineers and Construction URV drones, but the engineers refuse to do anything. One says he's repairing, but it's been 15 hours of in-game time of nothing. The other two engineers aren't even pretending to do their repair work on the engines.Did I mention selling the ships you captured? Well, that's only if you didn't tell one of the first ships to dock at the Ship Trader (you can only modify/sell ships to specific traders that know/want that type of ship) and repair itself, only to find out that the ship cannot move to the repair dock because the engines are destroyed and the engineer won't repair it. Now that Ship Trader is ""stuck"" on that order and will refuse to do any business with you, including selling any of your other ships. The only way to fix this is, again, to edit your save game and remove the repair order or just delete the offending ship. Also, you need Pilots to capture small ships (e.g. Fighters) and Captains to command the larger capital ships, plus an engineer to (maybe) repair the capital ship, but you may only carry a few (seven I think?) crew on your ship. You need a Marine Officer to even do the boarding, so that's one down already, so don't even bother with Pilots and trying to capture smaller ships. Best bet is to capture the ship, destroy anything Yisha asks you to in order to help the boarding process, and then immediately sell the ship. Don't try to fix anything. If you want a ship, go buy one from a Ship Trader.Seven years in the making? I seriously doubt that, or they spent all their time using developer hacks to do the fun events during QA and never played it like we mere customers would have to.			"

												This game has some of the most amaizing visuals I've seen. Playing it you feel that there is great potential in this product.That being said, this is not so much a game as an open beta of one. The entire game shows lack of polish and lots of bugs. This game has poorly optimized graphics, leading to constant lag. A lot of features are simply missing or have basic placeholders. There is poor ai, and very poorly designed station missions.Finaly this game has a clunky and poorly desighned management interface: everytime you give an order you end comunication. To give a ship an order often requres multiple comunication attempts to first cancel their order, then give them a new one. Since dialogue can not be skiped this takes minutes as you hear the same scripted message over and over. The poor desighn choices don't end there: as when the ming ship or a trade ship finishes there missions, they will imediatly go to your location regardless of what you are doing or where you are. So if you are in a major battle with a supper carrier: the poorly armed unarmored trade vessel will join in the fight and promptly get killed.So you have to imediatley stop what you are doing, and tell them to stop their curent order and hold their position. This can take 2-5 minutes and if you are fighting, this is the plenty of time for your enemies to blow you up.To sum up: if you are a fan of this series, you might want to buy this game (99% likely ot already own it)if you are not fan of the X series, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME			"

												In this review I shall not criticize as too many have already wasted all of their energy at that. Instead I shall list suggestions which would make this game's experience fantastic because the original concept is indeed fantastic, but unfortunately not exploited. All I mention here is based on enough hours of playing and completing the whole campaign (thanks to the 1.24 patch).Remember that Egosoft have already invested a lot of time, money and resources for the existing content, so do not expect much improvement on this project. They might decide to release DLCs but these are not solutions to existing problems, they are extensions of existing problems.Here it goes:__________________________________________Hardware-Make the game running smooth on the average modern PCControls-Enable look around using numpad as in X3-Split roll function in two button: roll right, roll left and assignable on gamepad as in X3X Universe-Add Boron and Paranid factions (it's unfair if they come in payable DLC)-Add Pirate stations. If not directly visible give hints, indications that they might be somewhere near some zones and we'd explore for them-Make trade/missions possible with PiratesGraphics-Make MPC characters look and act more realistic-Stations/ships/objects should not be visible while outside nebula cloud-Nebula cloud should be visible from any distance while in the sector, not just from its zone.-Prevent ships going through one another or through stations as if hollowOptional but doable cool and practical graphical suggestions-Make it possible to dock in stations manually with animation of opening hangar and docking procedure (if enabled by player   in settings)-Make it possible to travel in a station from one dock/area to another using a local train or something cool -Make planetary descent possible (limited areas only if too complicated) for trade and exploration, alone or with party (yes it's possible, Evochron series have this fantastic feature with realistic atmospheric characteristics)UI and cockpit-Remove radial menu and replace with command/property menu as in X3-Add radar display-On info display, while targeting ships, add distance and velocityIn albion Skunk-Disable/modify Ysha speech “Requesting permission to dock” when docking at own ship/station or Xenon stations-Enable free walking around the cockpit when not seated-Enable Click on pilot chair to be seated while free walking around instead of the control switch in the corridor-Enable interaction functions with other tools/computers in cockpit for small routine maintenance/monitoring (engineer cannot do everything)-Enable more speech with co-pilot and crew to kill the silence and stillnessNavigation & map-Enable jump drive for Skunk: gate to gate and point to point (unfocused optional but cool)-Enable zoom in/out in map, not just press sector/zone...-Add written details on map for stations, ships and objects, not just clickable list o right side-Enable filter map content for display-Let us select our own speed in highways instead of following other crafts-Have boost consume its own energy storage, not from shield or enable upgrade like energy splitter or something-When docked in carrier/capital ship fix the “plot course” function, or provide clear instructions-Add many more systems including our solar systemStations-Give traders appropriate stores/workshops, so that trade doesn't take place in a bunk or bar-Give NPC more dialog variety and more casual-Modify Ren Otani speech: “Show me your wares please”, to something more realistic, casual and add variety, not always the same sentence (appropriate the the service in question)-Make NPC give small missions (e.g. “provide 20 units of teladianium paneling”, “ship this package at this station to this guy”...) which would affect on discounts and rep on faction.Trade-Enable more than 3 planned trading trips per ship-When more than one trade trip is planned for the same station keep the ship docked till all transactions are finished-Add button in trade menu to view/edit/delete planned trade trips in detail-Add best buy/sell software upgrade (e.g. MK1 limited to sector, MK2 limited to system, MK3 for whole map)-Add many more upgrades for the SkunkShipyards-Enable command ship (all but Skunk) to go to selected shipyard for repair/upgrade without having to go there yourself first (with command menu X3 style this would be possible)-Enable purchase of fighters (if there are I must be blind) to use them as wingsCombat-Enable “Lock on Target”: when selecting a target it should be possible to press lock on target to stay locked on that target till it is destroyed or out of scanner range or you manually select another target. It should also be configurable in settings-Don't make enemy fighters stick so close to station like flies on a light bulb__________________________________________Some details might have slipped my mind, however, feel free to add or modify this list. I believe we should put as much pressure as possible on Egosoft on this cause it's really a waste. They really can make a master piece if they want as they've already done an amaising job with the X3 series, they just needed to improve on those.			"

												WITH 179 HOURS ATEMPTED PLAY  I am very sad to see the egosoft and steam name attached to this product. After 13 years of fantastic play in theprevious X-Universe games, with manny more to come. I was looking forward to a new venue from them based on all the great input from egosoft and player. This game however, has no feel of being developed by egosoft. It lacks all the character that made the X-Universe great.  If you want a space game buy the older X games , this one cannot be fixed.

												I was an avid fan of the X series and loved them all. In my honest opinion Egosoft already had the winning forula when it came to the space sim games and i think X fans would have been happy if egosoft stuck with that. I personaly think X online should have been (TNBT) unfortunately with the release of X-Rebirth Egosoft seem to have taken 1 step forward by trying to re discover the universe in a new fashion but by upsetting fans with a half baked release poorly writen unfinished REBIRTH they have taken 2 steps backwards... i think if your new to the X universe You will like REBIRTH  but as a die hard fan its lost its shine, in its attemp to become glorious its lost its meaning, its depth and its playability... If your new to the X universe its well worth a go, but i also urge you to visit the origional X games and u will see that in X-REBIRTH all that glitters is not gold.			"

If Egosoft are still around in a few years I'll come back and hopefully get to play XRebirth when its in a much better state.Massivly dissapointed.Would never pre-order or reccomend pre-ording another game from them again.

Next to that the radar is missing and there is no option to lock on to a target and keep following it.This seems like a game that just isn't finished. I'm doubtfull it will ever be playable.

												This Game engine is flawed with performance issues for High-end gaming PC's but according to other reports seems to work best with low end CPU's and Video card combo.'s. End results For Higher end gaming PC's: (AMD 6-core @ 4GHz; 8GB-RAM + ATI HD R2-290)> The game can become very laggy due to very, and I do mean very low FPS (5-10 FPS) depending on which area you are in.> Player experience is worse when in larger, big Space Ports with very busy traffic from many ships coming and going. > Player experience is best when in deep space staring into nothingness.> A flurry of patches/fixes are coming in from Egosoft but so far, very few of them have nothing to due with performance gains.> Player experience for Patches/fixes that do address performance gains, range from negligible at worst, to mediocre at best. Still, for many players the game remains unplayable.Conclusion:> This game is for you if you do not mind viewing this more as a ""turn based strategy game."">  If not; wait for the patches to fix the game ""The Way It's Meant To Be Played"". But lets face it; if it were that simple to fix, it would already have been fixed long ago and real performance gains may only be realized incrementally over a very, very long time. This, maybe even mores so if they have to port this over from Directx-9.0c to Directx 11.0 to fully fix the problem.I believe the reason they chose Directx 9.0c is because they thought they could use their experience with it as leverage for a  reduced development time but when the code never gets ""Locked"" due to continuing feature adaptations then this just stretched the development even more so. (7-years and counting).And of course Directx 9.0c is probably much cheaper to licence per game sold than Directx-11. "

												I paid $65 on release of this game and all I got out of it was a cool set of concept art wallpapers, a soundtrack (that I haven't bothered to listen to), and a broken game that I barely played because it was so poorly made.  Egosoft Studios should offer money back to their customers for this bait and switch.  It was highly lauded in promotion phase, but fails to deliver anything worth playing.I am at a loss for words to describe my disappointment with this game, and I really want to be polite, but there's only so many ways to say that this game is a failure in a nice kind of way.

												Never have I been so let down with a purchase.  I rank the previous X3 game one of my all time favorites. I played X3 modded outside of Steam so Steam doesn't show how many hours I put into it before this game.This is a sad example of the future of game development:  release horribly designed games with lots of bugs and when consumers complain, tell the consumers to confirm they have the most recent patch, a patch which doesn't fix anything and makes the game worse.There is still hope for this game because modders will fix it, but that is yet another reason why gaming quality is in jeopardy:  developers with a strong modding community know they can fall back on ""free labor"" to make their game work.Currently I don't recommend this unless you want to punish yourself.

												With another four to six months this game could have been excellent, but just like the release of X3 it was beyond broken on launch. After large amounts of patching, it is perfectly possible or even likely given the company's excellent track record with supporting their titles and listening to the community for future updates, that it will be fixed, balanced and fun, but as it stands it is not worth the price tag.Do not buy this game in it's current state, you will regret it. Wait for it to be truly working before thinking about dropping £40 on it. It is not just buggy and not properly optimised, but also badly thought out in terms of gameplay and interface, hopefully in future the community help to correct this.So wait for it and see, maybe this or one of it's many new competitors will give you the space sim fix you want :)			"

												Now I realize my review will be just another grain of sand on the beach of Normandy that was the disaster called X Rebirth and that my voice will most likely be drowned out by the shouts and cries of those others who purchased the title alongside me. Close to countless reviews found on just about any gaming website can elucidate the extent of the problems this game presented. I just wanted to highlight some that mattered most to me. Given that it's near impossible to get a game released these days without a slew of bugs and glitches, I don't want to spend too much time focusing on those errors. That said, it is worth asking how on earth a company as established as Egosoft could have possibly thought XR was worthy of release. A few glitches here, maybe a bug or two in that feature there, sure but what they gave us was just an utter shock. And you have to imagine that at some point, they sat down during some meeting just before launch and said ""well this is ready to hit the mainstream. We have a good product, a functioning product or at the very least a passable product but as we all know now, not one of those held true. NOT a one. To be frank, as consumers we have a right to expect a game to not have at least half the bugs XR had, especially in a AAA title. I'm not implying that every game released be absolutely bug free, but I equate this to gas prices. At a certain point in time, our country raises gas prices from oh, let’s say $2.00 a gallon to $4.50. Of course we're outraged but this persists for such a long time that when they finally reduce the price to $3.95, we jump for joy and hug our pets in excitement. Again, I don't expect the gas to be free, but I expect it to be reasonable. The games that have been released over the last few years are akin to charging a good $6.00/g for gas and nowhere has this been more true for me than with XR. I was so utterly frustrated doing the infamous 100 energy cell mission within the first hour of the game that my gf had to pull me away and take me to dinner to calm me down a bit but I let the game continue in hopes that my ship would find it’s way. Two and a half hours later and my freighter is still taking a sightseeing tour of whatever galaxy we're in (something I doubt I'll ever learn given the incomprehensible map system). Unfortunately, when I submitted for a refund 4-5 times, Steam laid this  as evidence against me stating I had played 20 some odd hours and therefore must have in some way approved of the product. Like most people I've spoken to or read about, the vast majority of that time was spent alt tabbed checking forums, practicing calming breaths, thinking about taking up religion again or going out to more dinners aimed at diffusing my ticking time bomb of frustration. Many others have stated this very thing in their own way and yet it shows us logging on more hours than we ever actually played. SO that all said, let’s say the Egosoft fairy waived her magic wand, which I'm sure is rife with glitches and probably using the wrong batteries and fixed every bug and glitch in the game. Know what we're left with? An glitch free POS. Look, I'm not trying to be some kind of hater. I, like everyone else tried time and again to justify the money I threw away in this game. And like some others also stated, there is the skeleton of a game buried in there somewhere, but I really did try. I have everything to gain in liking this game given the brick wall I've ran into with steam customer service. All the bugs aside, the design decisions they made in this day and age are just beyond understanding. I understand these guys are based in Germany but could they really not afford getting just one guy, ONE GUY who speaks native English on their staff to share some phrases with them that would pass off better than ""Go Boil your Head"" or, ""Nice talking to you...NOT"". Forget how utterly annoying it is that nearly every NPC is angry at you for no reason....well wait, they all appear to be over 70 years old, so maybe they're just old grouches.....that are supposedly piloting space and building empires......sigh.., forget the annoyance, if you can anyhow, but the dialogue left me embarrassed for them in some odd way.  How full of yourself and out of touch must you be? And How many times did Bernd say the word ""Immersion""? Yisha, the co-pilot is by far and away on my top three list of hair pullers. Forget her really creepy incomprehensible animation, not sure if she's pooping in her ventilated space suit, is she's part arachnid, fighting the urge to eat me, or doing calisthenics. What I don't understand is why they put her there. I know others have voiced this in their own way, but here's the bottom line. She doesn't do anything. At all. She doesn't pilot, trade, she is nothing more than a permanent plot prop piece. I've tried finding the woman who did the voice acting for her without success. Perhaps that's for the best. She doesn't need career changing advice from some yankee. But oh my sweet jesus is it awful. It again, ruins the whole immersion. Poorly written dialogue, made worse by the worst voice acting. Missions requiring me to go here to pick this up, then there to drop it off, then here to pick up something else, then there to deliver it. I'm a fed ex truck in space stuck on rookie training duty. What i did find funny was how very early in the game, the crew to which Yisha belonged to paid me good money (I'm assuming its good since I haven't really had a chance to see an economy function) to keep her with me. It totally sounds like a made up excuse to get rid of her now that she's no longer on their ship. Out of the  literally 12 times I had to restart the game, that was the only thing that made me smile until I realized it was me they pawned her off on. If I could have ejected her from my latrine shoot, I would have right onto their windshield.  I mean the list goes on and on and on. The one thing everyone was really excited about, or at least most people, myself included, was walking around space stations. God what an exercise in frustration that was. Cookie cutter, with every NPC doing the same task  in the same corner. Every box and locker making the same sound and getting you stuck in the process 25% of the time. It was all just one big horrible horrible horrible experience. And they charged us $50 for it. They made a lot of money while many of us gave a significant chunk of our meagerly paychecks for something we were hoping would take our minds off our meagerly paychecks. Instead, I’m forced to face the harsh realities of just how much spending $50 on the wrong present for myself can impact my life in a negative way. I’ve since moved on but then I saw that Steam is finally allowing us to write reviews so here is me waving my hands telling anyone thinking of XR to change course, go somewhere else. Dive into an empty swimming pool and incur more enjoyment. One a last note, I emailed egosoft early on and the Bernd man himself replied. I wont bother with the details cuz he didn’t give me any. It was short, condescending, blowing off my thoughts and recommendations and still full of himself with regards to that incredibly inappropriate “We’re a Success!” message he tied onto his failing apology. In short all that said was, we failed, you bought it, and we MADE MONEY OFF YOU!!! Yay!Sigh. Hey Egosoft, if any of you ever read this, go and apologize. Not to us cuz that would take the remainder of your lives to do. Rather, apologize to every other gaming company for the bad faith you instilled in all the gamers out there that will inevitably think twice about purchasing something at launch. You screwed up the curve in the worst possible way. So to all of you that made these decisions to the ones that knew better but lacked the courage to tell those in power  what time of day it was and that they’re releasing a big failure, I say SHAME on you.

												This game comes from a franchize that chose to break down the barriers between space sims and RPG's with ground breaking dreams of everything from a stock market to station owning/building to fleet designing and controlles and the ability to fly very nearly ALL ship types in the game (or capture/steel the ones you could not buy).  Yes there were issues and hurdles that had to be over come here and there in previos versions and some that never got resolved; I had hoped that this would be the truth here too as a new direction in this groud breaking thought line.  I have been playing the last 4 itterations of the Xuniverse franchise (I got hooked with the original X2 big time).  I was hoping that maybe all the hype was just due to this being a complete revamp of the entire design, alas this is not completely right, yes it is a revamp but with the redesign I find it more fun to play any space game but this one including DarkStar One, which advertised the same but was a bit of a fun yet still a flop of a game.  I would argue that nearly 90% of the intelligence and aspects of what made the previous game difficult to develop and create were removed or cheated out (Ships would commonly fly THROUGH stations so they do not have to die by the station simply becasue they can not fly around it).  If you wish a list of items that no longer exist then please ping me any time I will give you far greater detail as the game is no longer ""A Living Economy"" but now a totally fake and DEAD one, and I primise not to just wine because they changed the paint job, this game really does make me very sad that I spent the money to buy it.  I would have been better off spending that money on ANY other game including variants I do not like playing on PC, I hate to support horribly done games and I have to say I really am dissapointed in the developer I tryly enjoy games from (EGSOFT) thinking this was a releasable game (not to mention the number of serious buggs in it), after within only a few minutes of my first maiden flight I got runover by a freighter and pushed ""through"" the walls of a station and locked inside it making it impossible to escape and having to completely restart the game.  I highly reccoment as a gamer that you stay away from this title, get all of the X3 previous titles if you want to really enjoy a game for a long time and have endless relayability (I normally do not replay game but I have done so MANY times with X3 itterations previous to Rebirth).  I am truly sorry EGSOFT, you really let everyone down on this title, pleaes go back and look at why the previous game was so enjoyed and rethink the architecture including the rendering engine.  I KNOW you can do FAR better then this even in Beta class games.			"

												Critically panned by users and publications, X Rebirth is a horrific disappointment. The complete rejection of HOTAS joysticks and terrible performance has killed this series. Egosoft has done the unthinkable and terminated this game resulting in X Stillbirth. Maybe once the game has been heavily patched for a few years it will become playable however I purchased this based on the track record of Egosoft and how much I enjoyed the X 3 series so much. This has shaken my trust in Egosoft so greatly I will no longer purchase any of their products in advance.			"

Which you have to pay for and then provide all the parts for if the station you just bought it at doesn't have.But wait  ! There's more ! Even when you get said parts for that station, the aforementioned ""Trading system"" might just tell you to ♥♥♥♥ off leaving you with even  less credits in your pocket and still no ship.Kinda feels like EgoSofts whole business strategy. 1.Forget everything we learned from the last X games 2.Ship game with features no one wanted. 3.Apologize to people saying that you're sorry they don't get the design choices. 4.Push out patches for a game no one wants. 5.Say ♥♥♥♥ it and let unpaid modders fix it.

Story mode you have to revert back to so many save points because somthing wasnt done right or a bug poped up. You will spend 30 minutes on a mission only to find out you dont have somthing to finish. I just spent 2 hours on a single mission and I still have not gotten it correct. A full 25% of the time reloading the game from a save point will cause a crash. Another 25% of the time it will freeze. If you get this game you will come to a f it point and quit.			"

It is not just buggy and not properly optimised, but also badly thought out in terms of gameplay and interface, hopefully in future the community help to correct this.So wait for it and see, maybe this or one of it's many new competitors will give you the space sim fix you want :)			"

												This game just wasn't ready to be published.  After 21 patches and a month and a half after release, the game is still riddled with bugs.  I'm going to wait about 5 more months to try again as the developers are going to need that time to fix the uncountable issues with the game.  I still can't make it through the campaign without the game asking me to transport someone to some non-existent space station.  The only way people seem to make it through is by modifying the massive save files.  This game is worse than a lot of greenlight games are.  As a programmer I understand building a dynamic universe like this is extremely complex.  There are a lot of complaints about unfinished games being released to early from Battlefield 4 to Diablo 3.  Those games had some understandable problems on release.  This game however, is not even close to playable and can't even be compared to the problems other games have had on release.  I don't blame the developers, I blame the publishers for releasing a game that quite simply is not ready to be played.  I really wanted to like this game and tried really hard to looks past the glaring problems.  I really hope they succeed in fixing the issues and get the game to a playable state.			"

												Now I realize my review will be just another grain of sand on the beach of Normandy that was the disaster called X Rebirth and that my voice will most likely be drowned out by the shouts and cries of those others who purchased the title alongside me. Close to countless reviews found on just about any gaming website can elucidate the extent of the problems this game presented. I just wanted to highlight some that mattered most to me. Given that it's near impossible to get a game released these days without a slew of bugs and glitches, I don't want to spend too much time focusing on those errors. That said, it is worth asking how on earth a company as established as Egosoft could have possibly thought XR was worthy of release. A few glitches here, maybe a bug or two in that feature there, sure but what they gave us was just an utter shock. And you have to imagine that at some point, they sat down during some meeting just before launch and said ""well this is ready to hit the mainstream. We have a good product, a functioning product or at the very least a passable product but as we all know now, not one of those held true. NOT a one. To be frank, as consumers we have a right to expect a game to not have at least half the bugs XR had, especially in a AAA title. I'm not implying that every game released be absolutely bug free, but I equate this to gas prices. At a certain point in time, our country raises gas prices from oh, let’s say $2.00 a gallon to $4.50. Of course we're outraged but this persists for such a long time that when they finally reduce the price to $3.95, we jump for joy and hug our pets in excitement. Again, I don't expect the gas to be free, but I expect it to be reasonable. The games that have been released over the last few years are akin to charging a good $6.00/g for gas and nowhere has this been more true for me than with XR. I was so utterly frustrated doing the infamous 100 energy cell mission within the first hour of the game that my gf had to pull me away and take me to dinner to calm me down a bit but I let the game continue in hopes that my ship would find it’s way. Two and a half hours later and my freighter is still taking a sightseeing tour of whatever galaxy we're in (something I doubt I'll ever learn given the incomprehensible map system). Unfortunately, when I submitted for a refund 4-5 times, Steam laid this  as evidence against me stating I had played 20 some odd hours and therefore must have in some way approved of the product. Like most people I've spoken to or read about, the vast majority of that time was spent alt tabbed checking forums, practicing calming breaths, thinking about taking up religion again or going out to more dinners aimed at diffusing my ticking time bomb of frustration. Many others have stated this very thing in their own way and yet it shows us logging on more hours than we ever actually played. SO that all said, let’s say the Egosoft fairy waived her magic wand, which I'm sure is rife with glitches and probably using the wrong batteries and fixed every bug and glitch in the game. Know what we're left with? An glitch free POS. Look, I'm not trying to be some kind of hater. I, like everyone else tried time and again to justify the money I threw away in this game. And like some others also stated, there is the skeleton of a game buried in there somewhere, but I really did try. I have everything to gain in liking this game given the brick wall I've ran into with steam customer service. All the bugs aside, the design decisions they made in this day and age are just beyond understanding. I understand these guys are based in Germany but could they really not afford getting just one guy, ONE GUY who speaks native English on their staff to share some phrases with them that would pass off better than ""Go Boil your Head"" or, ""Nice talking to you...NOT"". Forget how utterly annoying it is that nearly every NPC is angry at you for no reason....well wait, they all appear to be over 70 years old, so maybe they're just old grouches.....that are supposedly piloting space and building empires......sigh.., forget the annoyance, if you can anyhow, but the dialogue left me embarrassed for them in some odd way.  How full of yourself and out of touch must you be? And How many times did Bernd say the word ""Immersion""? Yisha, the co-pilot is by far and away on my top three list of hair pullers. Forget her really creepy incomprehensible animation, not sure if she's pooping in her ventilated space suit, is she's part arachnid, fighting the urge to eat me, or doing calisthenics. What I don't understand is why they put her there. I know others have voiced this in their own way, but here's the bottom line. She doesn't do anything. At all. She doesn't pilot, trade, she is nothing more than a permanent plot prop piece. I've tried finding the woman who did the voice acting for her without success. Perhaps that's for the best. She doesn't need career changing advice from some yankee. But oh my sweet jesus is it awful. It again, ruins the whole immersion. Poorly written dialogue, made worse by the worst voice acting. Missions requiring me to go here to pick this up, then there to drop it off, then here to pick up something else, then there to deliver it. I'm a fed ex truck in space stuck on rookie training duty. What i did find funny was how very early in the game, the crew to which Yisha belonged to paid me good money (I'm assuming its good since I haven't really had a chance to see an economy function) to keep her with me. It totally sounds like a made up excuse to get rid of her now that she's no longer on their ship. Out of the  literally 12 times I had to restart the game, that was the only thing that made me smile until I realized it was me they pawned her off on. If I could have ejected her from my latrine shoot, I would have right onto their windshield.  I mean the list goes on and on and on. The one thing everyone was really excited about, or at least most people, myself included, was walking around space stations. God what an exercise in frustration that was. Cookie cutter, with every NPC doing the same task  in the same corner. Every box and locker making the same sound and getting you stuck in the process 25% of the time. It was all just one big horrible horrible horrible experience. And they charged us $50 for it. They made a lot of money while many of us gave a significant chunk of our meagerly paychecks for something we were hoping would take our minds off our meagerly paychecks. Instead, I’m forced to face the harsh realities of just how much spending $50 on the wrong present for myself can impact my life in a negative way. I’ve since moved on but then I saw that Steam is finally allowing us to write reviews so here is me waving my hands telling anyone thinking of XR to change course, go somewhere else. Dive into an empty swimming pool and incur more enjoyment. One a last note, I emailed egosoft early on and the Bernd man himself replied. I wont bother with the details cuz he didn’t give me any. It was short, condescending, blowing off my thoughts and recommendations and still full of himself with regards to that incredibly inappropriate “We’re a Success!” message he tied onto his failing apology. In short all that said was, we failed, you bought it, and we MADE MONEY OFF YOU!!! Yay!Sigh. Hey Egosoft, if any of you ever read this, go and apologize. Not to us cuz that would take the remainder of your lives to do. Rather, apologize to every other gaming company for the bad faith you instilled in all the gamers out there that will inevitably think twice about purchasing something at launch. You screwed up the curve in the worst possible way. So to all of you that made these decisions to the ones that knew better but lacked the courage to tell those in power  what time of day it was and that they’re releasing a big failure, I say SHAME on you.

I'm an X veteran.Don't buy it, at least for now. It's patch 1.21 and no sight of improvementA quote from other review:""A lot of people have been saying this game 'has promise'. That 'it'll be fixed in patches'. It won't. This game is defective by design. You can't just fix core fundamental game mechanics with patches. Even if they manage to fix the bugs it won't change the fact that everything in the game is completely lifeless and window dressed, rather than engaging or purposeful.""			"

												This game comes from a franchize that chose to break down the barriers between space sims and RPG's with ground breaking dreams of everything from a stock market to station owning/building to fleet designing and controlles and the ability to fly very nearly ALL ship types in the game (or capture/steel the ones you could not buy).  Yes there were issues and hurdles that had to be over come here and there in previos versions and some that never got resolved; I had hoped that this would be the truth here too as a new direction in this groud breaking thought line.  I have been playing the last 4 itterations of the Xuniverse franchise (I got hooked with the original X2 big time).  I was hoping that maybe all the hype was just due to this being a complete revamp of the entire design, alas this is not completely right, yes it is a revamp but with the redesign I find it more fun to play any space game but this one including DarkStar One, which advertised the same but was a bit of a fun yet still a flop of a game.  I would argue that nearly 90% of the intelligence and aspects of what made the previous game difficult to develop and create were removed or cheated out (Ships would commonly fly THROUGH stations so they do not have to die by the station simply becasue they can not fly around it).  If you wish a list of items that no longer exist then please ping me any time I will give you far greater detail as the game is no longer ""A Living Economy"" but now a totally fake and DEAD one, and I primise not to just wine because they changed the paint job, this game really does make me very sad that I spent the money to buy it.  I would have been better off spending that money on ANY other game including variants I do not like playing on PC, I hate to support horribly done games and I have to say I really am dissapointed in the developer I tryly enjoy games from (EGSOFT) thinking this was a releasable game (not to mention the number of serious buggs in it), after within only a few minutes of my first maiden flight I got runover by a freighter and pushed ""through"" the walls of a station and locked inside it making it impossible to escape and having to completely restart the game.  I highly reccoment as a gamer that you stay away from this title, get all of the X3 previous titles if you want to really enjoy a game for a long time and have endless relayability (I normally do not replay game but I have done so MANY times with X3 itterations previous to Rebirth).  I am truly sorry EGSOFT, you really let everyone down on this title, pleaes go back and look at why the previous game was so enjoyed and rethink the architecture including the rendering engine.  I KNOW you can do FAR better then this even in Beta class games.			"

												I have played X3 (Reunion, Terran Conflict, Albion Prelude) and X Rebirth. If you are looking for an X3-like game, stick with X3. X3 was an outstanding Space Simulation Game. This is an ok arcade shooter with some other stuff thrown in.Bugs are frustrating, but I can live with them; especially when I know the developers will get rid of them. The reason I do not recommend it is because the developers misrepresented the game.			"

												Critically panned by users and publications, X Rebirth is a horrific disappointment. The complete rejection of HOTAS joysticks and terrible performance has killed this series. Egosoft has done the unthinkable and terminated this game resulting in X Stillbirth. Maybe once the game has been heavily patched for a few years it will become playable however I purchased this based on the track record of Egosoft and how much I enjoyed the X 3 series so much. This has shaken my trust in Egosoft so greatly I will no longer purchase any of their products in advance.			"

												Well gotta admit I'm a major sucker for games that let you fly around in space and actually support the use of a joystick! Sadly thats the only good thing about this game even after so many so-called patches and a revamp with extra missions. The controls are buggy as hell. Docking is buggy as hell (Some stations I even gave up on trying - it's like a mini-game unto itself in the style of an old hidden object game)Gripping storyline? I've seen more grip on a lubed up stripper pole. And just like that last sentence, paying even half-price for this game leaves you feeling dirty and guilty.As a $5 bargain-bin non-steam game? Maybe. But as it is AVOID.			"

												I was an avid fan of the X series and loved them all. In my honest opinion Egosoft already had the winning forula when it came to the space sim games and i think X fans would have been happy if egosoft stuck with that. I personaly think X online should have been (TNBT) unfortunately with the release of X-Rebirth Egosoft seem to have taken 1 step forward by trying to re discover the universe in a new fashion but by upsetting fans with a half baked release poorly writen unfinished REBIRTH they have taken 2 steps backwards... i think if your new to the X universe You will like REBIRTH  but as a die hard fan its lost its shine, in its attemp to become glorious its lost its meaning, its depth and its playability... If your new to the X universe its well worth a go, but i also urge you to visit the origional X games and u will see that in X-REBIRTH all that glitters is not gold.			"
