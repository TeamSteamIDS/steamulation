												""Free to play"" is bordering on false advertising here. Most of the content is locked away behind a paywall.  And I don't mean cosmetic items on doo-dads to make you level faster. Most of the actual CONTENT you have to pay for. It's free to play in the same way WoW is free to play... you get to play some beginner content, and then you have to start paying to continue.  If you don't pay them at least $5 to upgrade your account to ""premium"", you are basically on your own to play a trial. Even if I wanted to give items to new players that are free to play (which I do), I can't, due to the very restrictive limitations on free players, and even premium players.  So, assuming you pay... is it a fun game? It varies mission to mission. Some mission mechanics are downright idiotic, with no fix in sight (Stompa in HH... players will know what I'm talking about... or even Paradox Wave for that matter), while others are reasonably satisfying to run (Desecrated Cathedral is a good 4-man mission).  But the learning curve is STEEP.  There are many ways you can fit your character, but only a handful of correct ways. Many players have been carried all the way up to the latest tier (currently tier 7), only to have to come to terms with their utter lack of understanding of the game, and are now expected to perform. Be prepared to suffer through many unsuccessful raids as you try to progress. And don’t even bother trying to progress a villain character at this point… the villain side is all but dead.  They were going to have cross-faction mission support on the last update, but it was cancelled at the last second… that leads me to the final point…The biggest issue with the game at the moment is support. Since Daybreak took over from SOE, support is now cut way back, and certain employees maintain clear grudges against players who raise issues that they would rather not deal with.  Both myself and the youtuber “MUD2MMO” encountered this issue with Ted Stone, aka “Mepps”, the Community Manager. When raising awareness for issues with Game Update 47 earlier this year on the DCUO forums, we were both banned.  After a few weeks passed, Mepps admitted to the problems we rose, but never apologized or repealed the bans.Verdict? Pass, until it's verified support has improved.			"

												I'd reccommend this game for anyone who enjoys DC lore and MMORPGS. It's not like any other system i've seen on any free mmo's. I enjoyed the PvP/PvE Diversity. And I liked the costume system.			"

												I’ll start by saying that I started playing this game since it launch and it wasn't on Steam, so the amount of hours I've put into it is sadly more than you can see. Also I am an Legendary/All Access member, so I have no restrictions in this game that you as a F2P player might encounter. I leveled a F2P character to the maximum achievable point, and I can tell that the only restriction that you will feel is the character slot limit (if you want to try all mentors and powers) and 1500 cash limit (you are allowed to carry only this amount with yourself, if you go over 1500 it will just go to the escrow and you won't be able to access it, only by paying). You can invest 5$ and some of the restrictions will get lighter, but the maximum amount of cash will be 2000, and believe me, you won't really feel it.I once wrote  loving review for this game, it was in 2012. Time is moving forward and yet the game does not. There was once a great amount of charm around this game, the road from 1 to max level was fast and colorful, and it was all based on quests. Yes, quests, filled with brilliant voice work and actually building up to the idea that Justice League will accept you as their member. Although there was a part of me that didn't really like this idea of levelling like a sidekick (after City of Heroes and Champions Online), but I was intrigued by the idea of what will open when you actually become a member. And then, after reaching max level, the problems started. Let’s talk about the endgame structure. After reaching level 30 you get introduced to a new vertical levelling system – Combat Rating(CR). All the endgame content is divided into Tiers, and each tier requires a certain amount of CR. Each tier consists of a few Challenges (Solo missions), Duos (2-man content), Alerts (4-man content) and Raids (8-man content). From each of this activities you get random loot drops (once a day) and a certain amount of currency that you can use to buy better gear. The better the gear -> the higher the CR -> the higher the tier that is available to you.So, let us continue. With introduction of new Raids and Alerts, the story still treated you like a sidekick. But that isn't really a problem. The problem was, that there wasn't an actual story behind any new content. Yes there are few Investigations/Briefings(game's variant of Data Logs), a few cutscenes and an ""epic premise"" behind the scenes, which you don't have an ability to enjoy. In all the modes you get a little glimpse at something epic. And that's it. They did try to implement daily story missions in some DLC's but the last fun ones were in ""Home Turf"", since then it was only getting more boring.Now remember that to get further in that little story, you need to have an appropriate CR. But until reaching the needed CR to open a new tier of content and some development on the story, you're just replaying the same few alerts over and over, grinding as if you're in an Asian MMO (which are changing to the best lately). Without any variation. Until you reach a new tier you are just replaying the same few activities. And the sad part is, that they reuse the same content in every new DLC, you will see instances that were there even from the launch of the game. And every new zone that they actually create in the latest DLCs are suffering from a copy paste syndrome, where the starting zone is something new, but when you walk a few meters all you get is catacombs with one repeating section. I've heard an argument that maybe they do this so that PS3 will run it without problems, but come on, Defiance on X360 has more variety.And that is the main point, comics are all about the story and characters, so was this game (from 1-30 levels). But in the end the focus shifted and instead of creating and implementing new campaigns, they create a few grind arenas. And after you reach that maximum CR there is nothing to do, except maybe feats that grant you some Skill Points, but you will need to replay the same content that you will probably hate.One thing that you can actually praise the development team for is balancing and patching. Although this praise can be nullified, because when you see their live stream where, after this many years, they are proud that some Bosses are no longer turning instantly, but they do take their time, it is just preposterous. But they do balance the powers towards each other, although instead of creating different instances of your power in PVE and PVP, they meshed it up and occasionally PVP players will cry about something, which will lead to PVE nerf for that power and brake someone’s style of playing.All in all, I do hope, that they will get back to their roots of creating stories and original content. Now that SOE has become somewhat independent, it can lead to great things or turning the money into a complete cash-grabber.If you are interested in this game, don’t invest money. Just play the game from 1 to 30, after that there is absolutely nothing, that is worth your time. Although, if you really like DC Comics, grinding, praying to RNG and story isn’t that important for you then go for it ^_^. If for you story is a must and you want to feel involved in DC Universe, then just go from 1 to 30 and forget about this game. Your time and money can be spent better. To everyone else, who don't look for Superhero MMO and DC Comics, I cannot recommend this game. "

												Awesome concept carried out decently. The combat is good and is mostly fluid, and PvP is a lot of fun. The quests can get a bit dull, but they break the regular MMO grind by throwing in boss fights every few missions and lots of rewards for exploration and story completion. The story itself is decent enough, especially in Gotham where you take on Bane and Scarecrow. The only major flaw in the story is the HORRENDOUS voice acting for the Brainiac characters and most of the cops in the nightclubs and police stations. The voice acting on those characters is so laughably awful it completely breaks immersion and sometimes actually makes me laugh aloud. However I will say that the voice acting on the hero and villain NPCs (Joker, Superman, etc.) is fantastic. It's really awesome to fight alongside Batwoman to take down Scarecrow, or Superman to take down the Brainiac horde. There are also some annoying things that should be addressed:1) When flying/running near enemies, if they attack you just once it slows your movement speed drastically, making navigating the city below the rooftops nearly impossible.2) Sometimes stun abilities just won't work on certain enemies with no explanation as to why. There was a boss fight in which we fought Power Girl and she was regular size, no outstanding special abilities, but was completely immune to being stunned or knocked down, which was annoying because my character was control and that's the entire point of my build.3) The flow of melee attacks can be awkward at times, mostly due to desync between players.4) Enemies that have stun and knockdown use it CONSTANTLY, and you have to sit there spamming shift to get out of it.Overall I give the game 7.5 out of 10, and would give it an 8 if they patched some of the player desync issues.ALSO, forgot to mention, the game has a decent community and a lot of older players are helpful to new players.

												One of the most fluid combat and movement systems in any MMO to date. A remarkable balance between gear dependancy and flexible, action-based combat makes the game progressively more interesting as you fight your way through a variety of well designed maps and boss mechanics. However, the skill system may seem rather simplistic at times.Content is plenty, often you may find yourself re-running certain raids and instances for marks and specific gear but the polished combat system makes this experience anything but a grind. There is a good amount of character customisation and an impressive amount of clothing items ranging from casual, iconic to just plain wacky. This combined with a wide range of power sets allows you to make a character specific to you.A caveat: The free to play model of this game is severly limited. Bank space, inventory, money (all of which necessary for a comfortable progression) are restricted to a point of frustration, especially as you enter harder raids, where a single potion (soda) can entirely drain your bank balance. While it is possible to individually increase these assets, doing so, and buying the many content DLCs, will cost upwards of $100 or a $15 a month subscription.			"

												I loved this game for over 4 years, but the constant game bugs that never get fixed (if you report the bugs to the developers, you will be told basically the issue is your hardware & never the developers fault & the bug will never be fixed), and constant cash grabs by greedy developers have just ruined this game. There is even a bug in which you won’t be able to collect a certain mission while levelling your character that has never been fixed…& that was 2 years ago, with no fix in sight. ‘Free To Play’? HA!! This game is STRICTLY ‘Pay To Win’. You can hold $1500 cash if you are FTP, if you have spent $5 or more and are Premium: $2000. If you want to buy parts to make mods for your gear or even soders over tier 2, $5000+ just for 1 part. At the moment, just to buy 1 tier 8 soder cola enhancer...almost $10,000. Almost $20,000 for 1 part of a gear mod (you will need 20 of these if you want to mod all your gear peices).If you don’t have the power ‘flavour of the month’, or aren’t willing to pay real dollars to change to the power ‘flavour of the month’ ($10 US a pop btw), don’t bother going DPS (damage role). You won’t be able to get up, or get anywhere near the power ‘flavour of the month’s’ damage (not even if you have more skill points than them) which makes for an EXTREMELY toxic community, totally unbalanced game and a huge cash cow for Baybreak, who as far as I can tell, only want your money & don’t care at all about you or the game. The game is all about ‘skill points’. Skill points are used to give your character permanent stat increases which you can obtain by completing feats. So the more feats you complete, the more skill points you get which should make your character stronger right? Wrong. Like I said before, unless you have the power ‘flavour of the month’, don’t bother.Pvp was good, until they changed it to accommodate for lag. Basically you have 1.3 seconds (not sure of exact times) to block or counter your opponent. It used to be if you were blocking, you were blocking, if you weren’t blocking, you weren’t blocking. Pretty simple rock, paper, scissors combat system, that is now completely broken. It is that broken that I don’t even bother with PVP anymore.I’d recommend playing this game for a bit to check it out, and then go to something else. Don’t EVER pay ANYTHING for this game, it’s not worth it. Now that they have gone back to big content DLC's it's a bit better, but not much.			"

												I'm not gonna go on a huge rant here, so I'll keep it simple and short.Worth trying out if you're into superheroes, but be prepared for a really short character progression (you top out at level 30), and paywalls literally everywhere. Want to use all that cash you've found on your missions? Paywall.Want to upgrade your base with those nifty items you've got? Paywall.Want to get that cool power that you saw this guy use? Paywall. And so on. In short, fun for a while, but it gets stale fast, with all the paywalls and the limited scope of the story.			"

												Used to be quite fun to play as a premium member.  You could acquire marks and upgrade your gear if you didn't mnd a bit of grinding.  Now, however, all items are blocked by ""CR levels"" so you can't run through the early items for only a few marks if you're too high.  Plus, as a ""free player"" you can't get over Combact rating 84.  I had a character before all these updates that I had up at CR102, and now if I play him, he will never receive Marks.  It's taken the fun out of the game in my opinion.			"

												Do you suffer from hero worship? Have you ever wanted to know what it feels like to be a super hero?Have you ever wanted to work as a team, combine your mighty mightness and taste digital victory?If you've anserwed ""yes"" to one or more of these questions, this game may be worth trying out.I started off playing this game as a ""free to play"" player and continued as such for almost 2 years. Only buying a very inexpensive DLC from time to time. So this game certainly delivers on that aspect.With constant updates, good customer service and FULL Xbox controller compatibility, eventually paying $10 a month for a membership (which comes with it's own set of percs) seems hardly too much to ask for.Of course, nothing is perfect and this game does have it's flaws, but the devs certainly seem intent on bettering the player experience as the game evolves and matures.Coupled with an outstanding story line (in the typical DC Comics fashion) and all the time honored characters, we Fanboys love ever so much, DC Universe Online is a keeper or at the very least, worth a try.Sincerely,The man of adventure,Mr.Venture			"

												I really wish I could give an inbetween for free to play games like this rather than yes or no.With that out of the way, I do recommend playing this game up to level 30 but I can't really recommend spending anything on it or playing the post-30 content. I've sunk a lot of hours in and a bit of money and while I don't totally regret it, the game definitely loses its luster after the leveling up stage (which is really act 1 for MMO RPGs). The world is really cool, especially if your a DC Comics fan, and the pre-30 bosses are some of the better MMO bosses I've seen. Also it features a really cool appearance system that lets you customize character looks without sacrificing stats. However, post 30 you will encounter extremely boring and generic raid bosses, a restrictive balance system that thwarts creative builds and a long grind for gear with little fun to redeem it. Its just downhill once you hit 30. I've quit and have no intention to return in any serious way.			"

												I've never been one to write Reviews, but here goes. DCUO is very polarizing, it seems. Some people claim there is a good, loving community always available to help. Some say it's an acidic community that leaves people feeling insulted. Personally, it depends on when you log in. To be honest, while MMO's are frequently about community, so much of this game could be played alone for the Super-Hero experience. The game is, very much Free. While high-end content requires DLC expansions, you can play from Level 1 to Level 30 (Max) without much care. If you want to play certain powers, then yeah, you have to buy something - but despite a lot of claims, these powers aren't the powers you ""Pay-to-Win"" for. It's no different than when other MMO's release new classes. The builds are broken. There are exploits, but after a patch or two, the power levels match up again, and it becomes about skill once more. As far as the Combat goes, it has a Rock-Paper-Scissors feel quite often. Melee breaks Range. Range breaks Block. Block breaks Melee. While annoying at first, it allows you to know that you should always be able to escape an otherwise inescapable combo by just knowing what breaks what. Melee Character wailing on you? Block it. Dual Pistol Character kiting you at range? Hold Melee and get a lunge in (every Fighting style has a lunge of some kind). That's another thing about the game that's rather nice. The fact you get to place the Fighting style of your choice, with the Power style of your choice allows you to create a custom ""Class"". And with each Power having two different trees, the variety increases more. A Bow/Nature (Flora) will play a lot different than a Martial Arts/Nature(Fauna), even though they are both essentially ""Nature"" Classed. So... yeah. All in all, try it. It's free. It only costs you some Bandwidth and Disk Space. If you don't like it, Uninstall for a free ""Refund"".			"

												I used to really like this game. Leveling up used to be a fun experience. The graphics were really nice, character customization was excellent, and the voice acting was superb.But the DLCs. Oh my god the DLCs. They never end. They never stop coming. It's like they give you a cookie crumb and it's the most delicious cookie crumb you've ever tasted so you want more. They are holding the rest of the cookie and offer you another crumb of it for $15. So you pay the $15 for the first DLC only to realize half of these powers are exactly like the last power set you played only with a different skin. But what the hell maybe I'm just imagining things. Then the next DLC comes out and you want to taste that delicious cookie once more. You pay another $15 and make a new character. Yadayada yada I'm tired of leveling in the same zones with the same quests that have no replay value. I'd rather go read a book or something. So you decide to try some end game content with your level 30, only you can't because there is none unless you buy all the DLC. Little did you know the 2 DLCs you bought didn't actually come with any end game content that people actually play. Pros: Game looks nice 5/5Voice acting 5/5Gameplay 4/5 at firstCons: The game is a sample of a bigass cookie that is sold as DLC crumbs Over 9000 DLCsDLCs DLCs DLCsMore DLCsInterface was mostly terrible with very little optionsDid I mention DLC?Lots of grindingPoor power designHarsh caps on everythingWhat's this?

You got do the same missions over and over to get marks to buy gear to raise your cr up. You keep doing it over like I said before. If you're a pvper, the devs ruined on here you get 1 shot alot and low lvls can kill you if your max gear. Pvp phase is dead so no luck there. Everyone hangs at the Watchtower/Hall of Doom spending hours siting at a wall, ledge, and etc. It's more of a pve game.Bad things about it: 1st Devs dont listen to the community and also money ♥♥♥♥♥s                                  2nd.

But dont spend money it's not worth it. You can look on they're Youtube vids that they dont play or care about the games.

												DC Universe Online is a super-hero MMO that makes you feel you're the next Superman or Wonder Woman as you're a hero helping your comrades against the opposition and the main threat, Brainiac.The story brings an underrated villain, Brainiac, into the Hero vs Villain fray and decides to start destroying Earth after he obtains all bits of intelligence (which also means humans). Lex Luthor, who saw Brainiac invading, left the rest behind to be destroyed and travelled to the past, warning the present heroes of the upcoming threat. Using Exobytes, technology stolen from Brainiac that was stolen from the heroes and villains of the future, he allowed the entire of Metropolis and Gotham to have superpowers to defeat Brainiac.Aside from the story, the gameplay is very diverse and gives you plenty of opportunities to display yourself. In character creation, you choose from plenty of powers (some requiring DLCs), weapons (one currently requiring DLC), and three movement modes (Flying, Super Speed, and Acrobatics). You can also choose side, personality, and mentor. Choosing a side means you're either a hero or a villain. Your personality reflects how your presence affects other players (how they think of you), and mentor (which kind of hero/villain you are). Depending on mentor, you can be a magic, meta, or tech character, and you will do two mentor quests in the entirety of the story (which is not much, but it's better than listening to Oracle or the Calculator all the time) and fight the nemesis of your mentor (Lex Luthor, Circe, or Joker). The story in this game is pretty much known to the community as the tutorial. It shows you around, has you geared up, and ready for the main part of the game: Increasing combat rating or PvP combat rating.On the topic of PvP, there are five kinds of ways to PvP: Worldwide PK (PvP phase), Ring War/Diamond Heist, Arena PvP, Legends PvP, and duels. Dueling, at this point, only helps with a few feats, the most you'll get feat-wise would be Arena or Legends PvP. Legends PvP is different to the others as you use a character from the Legends roster. You can be Doctor Fate, Kyle Rayner...heck, even Classic Batman in Legends PvP (note that gear and traits won't make you better in this kind of PvP).Now on to feats. Feats are like achievements, but they actually account for something. Feats come with feat points: the harder the feat, the more points you earn. Every 100 feat points will earn you a Skill Point (so you don't feel like you're stuck with 15 SP the entire game). The more feats you do, the more skill points you earn, and the easier for you to increase combat effectiveness.The next point to note is alerts/raids/duos/solos. These are pretty much dungeons/instances where you go and do missions related to the instance to earn Marks of Triumph (later tiers will have something different). The higher the tier, the more Marks of Triumph you will earn, and an added bonus if you complete ones with a star beside them. Duos and solos can be fairly easy, as you can do them seperately from your peers, but alerts/raids require you to engage in strategic fights with your allies. If you're not able to engage in conversation and strategize, you won't make it far.The only issue I have with this game, for personal reasons, are the DLCs. Understandably, they do need a way to earn a profit, however to make a game Pay 2 Win (P2W), is a fairly bad way of making a profit. To engage in anything from tier 4 and up will require legendary membership or the purchase of certain DLCs to be involved. Other than that, if you do get a DLC, you're treated to it's benefits.Pros:• Original story• Nostalgic characters• Legendary voice-acting (especially Mark Hamill's Joker voice)• Immersive and enjoyable gameplay• Engaging and strategic boss battles• Near-infinite customization possibilitiesCons:• Pay 2 Win• Spawn killing can be abused in PvP• Friendly mobs involved in a mission can be killed by enemy players (which leads to delays in progress)• Spawn killing while in PvP phase• PvP isn't exactly balanced• A few bugs here and there (like Cape Carmine Lighthouse lvl 9 mission on solo, being very hard to complete)Conclusion: I would recommend this game for the fans of the DC comics and for those who just love to enjoy a taste of being a superhero or supervillain. If any of you read this and require assistance in-game, do feel free to message me if you're on USPC. ~Permafrost Imp			"

												The game starts to get really good once you hit the max level (finish the tutorial), and have the oppurtunity to participate in group duos, raids (4 player), and raids (8 players). You have the chance to get some nice loot and go up against some of DC's greatest villians. There is also collectables galore, pvp, pvp with dc characters, homes, bounties, and much more.			"

												This game has to be one of the best MMORPG I have ever played. The game was at its prime when I started (Which was a few years ago); I remember seeing a lot of Heros and Villians doing their own thing whether its missions, at the main hub or doing raids and instances. You could totally get in any of these instances in around 1-7 mins.Now.....The game is a dead wasteland. The only way you're going to get into an instance is by either your friends or some high tier player trying to help another person. Me and my friends have had a lot of time in this game but everyone quit, even the well known players. The only people who remain is the high teirs and unfortunate beginners who have no idea but wasting time.I would have recommended this game a year ago. I just hope they can pull of something good to bring a large part of the population back so I can once again enjoy this game. But the way things are going, I don't think there even will be a DCUO left.			"

												Calling this game ""Free to Play"" is just straight up false advertising. This ""free"" version should instead be called the ""demo version"" as the vast majority of this game is locked behind paywalls, including some of the cool powers. This game is NOT free to play, it is free in the same way world of warcraft is ""free"" as it is only free for a little bit (in this game it's up to level 30 when you have to go premium).This is a fantastic game, and this game was absolutely amazing a while ago, before the developers sold out. It's such a shame that this game is a shadow of its former self.If you have cash to fork over to play this game seriously, do it.If you want a truly ""Free to Play"" game, you're out of luck as for this title.

												At first this game feels and plays like a general hack n slash with RPG elements thrown in and for the most part it is but its suprisingly deep and the story flows well, the amount of costomization is great and aside from the somewhat sour attitude the community in-game has towards ANY question asked people tend to be nice if you take the time to talk to them. i went into this with the intention to play a bit and spend 0 cash, i have been playing almost a year now and bought a few DLC all of which are out of choice not because progress halted. pick it up and try it out. if your a DC fan you will have a great timne and if your a new DC fan then you will be able to learn about the characters and world they all live in.

												I really loved this game and I tried hard to keep loving it but I can't. I just can't.Let's start with this: DCUO has the potential to be one of the best online game! But it will never be.Why? Developers.. Gamers should never support this kind of money grabbing system. All they try to do is hiding microtransaction for parts of the game that should just be free. You want more skins/level ups/episodes/characters/items etc? Pay.Do the devs listen to the community? NopeIs it a demo? No, but it feels like (after level 30 it gets boring)Is it P2W? You can bet on itI love the DC universe but a game like this is just not worth spend time.I would rather pay once like 20 or more euros instead of paying for every single item and/or apply for a subscription that till now has given problems to people. People cancelling their subs and still they see money taken from their accounts.If you wanna play, do so because it's fun. But please don't buy anything. Don't touch daybreak games cause it's not worth it.5/10			"

												The main problem I have with this game is that it is (dead), atleast compared to how it was before. It is really hard to group up with anyone, you would be better off playing with friends. However I think the only thing that could save this game from completely dieing would be making all accounts legendary and letting everyone have access to all content, besides the cosmetics ( which you would still have to buy). They would still make money but the game would be a lot more accessible to a larger audience. Other games have shown that this is still an affective  way to make a profit, for example Path of Exile< There is a reason the game is dead you basically can't play it for free which is what puts off a lot of players, considering it is advertised to be a f2p game.

												This is a very difficult game to enjoy, and it's not because of any one thing.The superhero genre is at its peak across mediums. So, one would expect that with DCUO being one of only two MMOs set in the superhero genre, it wouldn't be difficult all that difficult to make an amazing game. Indeed, this game has some of the best ideas I have ever experienced in an MMO... yet manages to bork the implementation of every single one of them.First, lets talk about character creation. At first glance, it looks pretty decent. There are a fair selection of quality starter items, and lots more can be unlocked by playing the game. Unfortunately, those unlockable costume pieces are unlocked *per character*, which means you can never actually start with the character look you *want* to have. In some cases, unlocking the pieces you need to complete your character's look can take *weeks* of grinding for *hours every day*.This purposeless, artificially-limited aspect of the game has all but destroyed DCUO's role-playing community. And if you know anything about the tight bonds that role-players bring to a game, then you'll recognize the assinine idiocy behind the way this game's character creation continues to be handled.On a somewhat less-intolerable note, the colour pallet is limited to storing four colours. They can be any colours you want, but once you pick them, all of your costume pieces are limited to those four colors.The power and weapon sets in this game are probably it's biggest boon during power creation. They really are fantastic, even if some of them are locked away behind paywalls.The missions are fun and not too tedious, even when replayed. And there's lots of raids, PvP, and open-world events, too.DCUO is often compared to Champions Online, the only other active MMO in the genre. This game has better gameplay, a better setting, better combat, better enemies, better raids, and better overall content. Yet, DCUO universally considered a vastly inferior product based almost solely on gamers' (in)ability to create the character appearance they want from the start.Ultimately, if you're looking for a game to create the superhero of your dreams, go for Champions Online. If you're looking for a game with an active community, go for Champions Online. If you're looking for a game to role-play a superhero of your own creation, go for Champions Online (or Paragon Chat). If you're looking for a game to play with friends, go for Champions Online. But... if you're looking for a game that has great content to solo, and you don't care about how your character looks, or that lots of powers and weapons are stuck behind payways, and you only intend to play one or two characters, then... THEN... consider DCUO. But honestly, you'll probably have more fun in Champions Online--which is sad, because Champions Online really isn't that good of an MMO.			"

												It's free, It's got a lot less costume options TO START with then say city of heroes or Champions has. But the more you play, the more you unlock. Costumes can be changed on the fly, player housing is awesome, theres some limits as it's also a console game. But you do feel very heroic, only 30 levels but find yourself an active guild and do all that amazingly diverse end content. :3 I'd recommend it to the super hero fan			"

												Basically, if you want to get into MMOs from having never really played one, this is the one to do it with. It's incredibly simple and that's the appeal it has to everyone. It tries its best to get you to be a subscription member, though, with most of the content inaccessible without DLC (which is given to you provided you have a subscription). Even if you buy all the DLC, you're capped at a measly 2000 Currency, a meager 500 more than a Free-To-Play user. That's frustrating. I mean, sure, I did have Subscription status for the 3 months I played this game, but I can imagine, considering I had significantly more money earned than a Premium user can hold with one mission, the game wouldn't be fun without a subscription. I should also mention I made sure to grind out those three months because I didn't want to feel like I wasted the money. That was the only real motivation to keep playing after three weeks.The game has a level cap of 30 which takes less than a week to get to with casual play and rewards you for doing quests rather than grinding out monsters for 308104123131 hours. So, hitting level 30 is very easy.The caveat to this, as there always is, is that being level 30 doesn't mean you're capable of being the objectively strongest character in the game. Regardless of power set imbalance (of which there is a lot), hitting level 30 means you can get your Combat Rating (actual literal level) up to as high as 103 as of the time of this posting. This won't come overnight, though, and likely you won't pass even 80 without buying some sort of DLC. And that's fine. I get it. Sony gotta get paid, son. That said, though, there is a lot of possible customization in the game. Each time you pick up a piece of armor, you save the style it has. You can then go back and equip any set of armor and change the styles as you see fit. That tends to work out because most of the sets look disgusting fully equipped. That is the game's main feature. It can appeal to anyone wanting to pretend to be a super hero. All of the Role-Players would love this game.Unfortunately, outside of this being your first MMO ever, this game isn't fun. Once you get a rotation down, that's it. You're using that for life. Kind of. Maybe you'll have two rotations, one for ranged and one for Melee. But that's about it. You're limited to 6 possible powers, 1 consumable* and 1 trinket*. There's not much room for customization and there are ideal loadouts to use. Using the same loadout from CR 25 or so (Fresh level 30) all the way to CR 90 (where I stopped) got boring real fast. Sure, I made different characters, but the game really has a way of punishing you for having alts through Feat Points.Oh my god Feat Points.Basically, they work as achievements in other games, except, they're character bound and they allow you to unlock another point to spend in your movement tree or your weapon specialization trees. You need tons of them to be useful in higher CR content. Tons.Yeah, so like I was saying, if this is your first MMO ever, feel free to try this one out. It'll reward you really quickly in the beginning for just playing. If you're a seasoned veteran of MMOs, however, don't even bother with this game.* if you buy a certain DLC, you can have any combination of 1 consumable + (0-4) Consumables + (0-4) Trinkets where the two (0-4) sums must add up to at most 4			"

												Played this game since day one, closed beta as a matter of fact.      Playstyle, speed and range are what is truly customizable. The Combat 'RPS' and its impact on group play and particulary PvP is what makes this game stand apart. Strategy through group make-up (types and amount of healers and DPS especially), positioning and even powerset/weapon choices is what makes this game fun.     DCUO is an ACTION MMORPG. RPG being the LAST of those acronyms there and ACTION being first! Play this game to do what/feel like a SUPERHERO or SUPERVILLAIN does. NOT to dress up or have 'justice league' meetings.     Like console fighting styles with a linear 'tap for tap' combo system? Like Social Gaming and 4 and 8 man large group content? Enjoy Solos or even quick queue times of 2-man 10+/- minute instances?

												I bought almost all dlc in this game and i played enough to say that this game is pay to win and here are the reasons:1. There are 5 tiers of pvp gear. Free players can get only tier 1 gear(and some parts of tier 2) cause there is a 1500 money cap. If you pay you will unlock the other tiers(you still have to farm the marks to buy them but the free players can't making the competition have no choise).2.If you Buy DLC you will have the chance to unlock more feats(=skill points). A free player can get up to 130 skill points max and  a paying player can get over 185 skill points(probably 190). Skill points increase your damage, critical chance and many other stats. Some people will say that 1 or 2 skill points doesn't make any difference. That's wrong cause at some point you will unlock the masteries of the weapons and if you put just 1 point in the masteries tab you'll get a huge boost in the stats. Ex: 3 points in the precision slot= 75 might and 90 precision. That's a huge number and there are over 10 weapon masteries.3.There is a dlc(home turf) that let you use Orbital strikes that does 25k damage to the minions and a huge amount to a group of players(it's an aoe attack). It also gives you a supply drop that recovers almost all of your hp and full mana if you are in pvp gear. The same dlc gives you a sidekick and 3 henchman that will attack your enemies and knock them down(sometimes even kill people without you doing anything if they are low geared). Again this dlc also gives you white mods that are kinda over powered in pvp. There are so many mods I can't list you everything.4.You can't create higher level socket mods if you are free. Those things are also very strong stuff.5.You can't create high level soder colas. This soder colas give you most of your hp and always full mana un like regular colas.6.There is a dlc that let's you buy an utility belt that let you carry more gadgets and consumables while a free player can't. You would think this is just a space/time saving thing but it's not. If you pay another dlc you will get a dlc that let you transform into flash and increase your stats by a lot->and at higher combat rating you will drop another trinket that boosts your stats more than the other trinket I talked about(you can't get this one either as a free player).7.Now we've come to the funniest thing about this game. Even if you get all the dlc(around $100 or more) you don't get the full game. You will be treated like ♥♥♥♥ by the developers and by the people who got a monthly membership. Your money cap will go up to 2000 from 1500 when you will become a premium member. Monthly subscribers will get unlimited money. There are things that cost as much as 1.5 milions or over in the broker market.One last thing that doesn't have to do much with p2w is the cash shop. A dlc cost $10 and changing movement type, power or something else cost the same. A non-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ person would be like "" Are you for real?"" on that. There are many over priced stuff in the cash shop. The most usefull item is probably the Armory which let's you switch build with 1 button(this is not pay to win). Here's the funny thing, it cost 600 station cash. You can only purchase 500sc for $5 or 1000sc for $10. You will have to spend $10 instead of  $6 to buy that. That's a cheap market trick that leaves a bad reputation on the company(SONY).I also want to point out that the game without dlc is almost empty compared to other games I've played.  The DLCs are quite small on content cause you don't get many things from them. You'll get a new raid and maybe a new power and that's it.Good things about the game:1.Movement modes->you can have flight, acrobatics and super speed. Strange thing is that super speed is not the fastest movement mode, acrobatic is. Some people that played the game for years say that super speed has the fastest acceleration but it's not true. Flight has the fastest acceleration cause it can go to top speed in less than a second unlike the other 2 movements but it has the lowest top speed. Acrobatics is twice as fast as super speed(tested in metropolis).2.Everything is voice dubbed including Raids and other stuff and it loooks like they spent some effort into that. Many times it feels cinematic which is nice.3.The story is nice and original but you'll have to get the dlc to explore it.Do I recomend this game? No I don't if you want fair fights and more competition in online games. I would say try it for fun but that's about it. If I were you I wouldn't support developers that encourage a pay to win system. I spent money on the game thinking it was awsome and it wasn't pay to win. I wanted to support the developers. Now I understand how things work in this game and i'm getting my last dlc today just cause I want to get more skill points and more currency from new raids. Not gonna buy anymore dlcs after this.

(and by a lot, i mean i played on PS3 before playing it here on steam)On steam: i played with friends, with out spending money too, then we decided that it whould be fun to buy a new superpower and start over, (diferent power for each friend) that was when it all went wrong, max leveled chars, each one of us had access to diferent raids (because it came with the dlc) and we could'nt play together on those raids, because our dlc's were diferent. it was a big let down,there was nothing to unless we do the same raids over and over, we all stopped playing, never came back, because we had fun but we payed and the paywalls still blocked our fun. and after soo much time when i remember that i played this i say, i would like to playit again, but to do what, do the same quest over and over? kill ramdom mobs or players on the city? it has no meaning now that i know that i cant really enjoy the game.ps: here some of the game ideas for selling dlc: you have a low money limit, if you buy some power they will increase that limit but still not enough to do stuff in game like buying stuff in the marker tutorial: heres you base, you can do all kind of cool things here, reality: heres your empty apartment, you can barely decorate it but need dlc to use it as a base, or anything else. look in the dlc list, theres these things called episodes... never knew that they were, because its payed and more episodes keep coming and i look that at that list and i see a lot of money that i dont have, to complete a game that i liked and can never enjoy...thx for reading			"

Its a love-hate relationship you'll have with this.The things to love are the fact that its riddled with DC lore and characters and you'll feel like your a part of the series itself. Character creation isn't too horrible if your planning to play only vanilla, but unless you shill out for the powers, which are by far better than the originals then you generally won't have a hope of winning in future story DLCs/PvP.The thing I despise are the story DLCs that emerge costing  ~$15.00 everytime. It's good that there is fresh content being released regularly but the fact that you continue to pay for a storyline over and over again are a deal breaker for me. Reason is you cannot get the next tier gear say T4 without it. The consequence is that if you skipped a few DLCs you'll either have to pay for the skipped DLCs to play gear catch-up or make sure you have a team who will carry you through the latest missions. This is definitely fun, and I was among an original adopter of this game (PS3). Unfortunately unless your willing to let your purse-strings be unwound a lot then you'll lose interest pretty quick.

												As a regular player of the game, I will go Schrodinger and not recommend the game while recommending it.1 - If you intend never to spend any money on this game, don't play it for more than once per week. Endgame is seriously limited after you hit max level, specially as you can progress very quickly on that point. Conversely, subscribers might enjoy the game a lot, unless they allow very little to bother them.2 - Do not queue publicly after Tier 4. Teams are horrible and, to add to that, refuse to acknowledge their own fault. I don't even bother trying to tell them that (I don't like pointing fingers at others), I play as a Healer (Hi, world, it's Combat Doctor here!) and I just stand there keeping my team alive and trying to keep myself out of trouble.3 - Keep your voice chat off. Your ears will be very thankful. 4 - Play with friends.5 - Don't bother about power customization if you want to play a damage role or any role whatsoever. Thanks to Advanced Mechanics, pratically all power customization has been thrown down the toilet. You can make custom builds, but they won't be nearly as effective as the cookie cutters.Potential 10/10, currently 5/10 from me.			"

												Though I'm familar enough with the DC Universe from a pop culture perspective, DCUO was an outstanding 'educational' experience, putting me in the middle of massive DC lore. I learned a lot about characters and locales that I've only ever given a passing glance. The graphics are pretty nice in a optimized sort of way. There is quite a bit of varability to your character, though extremely simplified from more traditional RPG's. The F2P aspect really doesn't hurt you too much until you've reached end game levels and are finding yourself bored. At this point, you either decide to move on to something else or start plunking down for DLC, which will include additional character options, maps/arenas and storylines. Unless you jump, head first, into the end game content, the community really doesn't do much with you. You can join a league, but from beginning to entry level raiding, you aren't really worth the time for anything helpful. The 1-30 run can be handled solo, with the occassional interaction with the community, so if you're there, just to see the sights, it's well worth the venture. Pros:Lots of DC history.Easy to learn gameplay.Graphics work well from medium to higher end systems.Lots of DLC, if interested.Cons:The community snubs it's nose at F2P'ers.You only have Gotham and Metropolis as open world content. The rest is instance play.You are relatively limited in character builds unless you purchase DLC.Little to no viable end game content for F2P'ers. Pony up $$ if you want to keep advancing.			"

												It's good game. Good lore, good graphics, good voice acting.Sadly, I can't recommend it because it's a p2w game and it's VERY restricted if you don't pay. Which leaves you with doing the same unresticted missions over and over with 0 chance of progressing in the game.I'd change my mind if there were less restrictions thou.			"

												If you are a fan of comics, then this is your dream come true!DC Universe Online has matured quite a bit since launch, adding much-needed elements like crafting, home bases, and more end-game content, but maintaining a level cap of 30 may put off those players who’d like to further advance their veteran characters or are primarily interested in soloing. That said, DC Universe Online is the best super-hero MMO out there and well worth the free download.			"

												I played this game in beta. It had many promising features but as the game progressed they cut corners or dismissed entire ideas. After a year i went back and found it is now Free to play but with Microtransations. I instantly hated the game. Just like Star Trek Online, it is wrapped in DC with voices from the Justice League Cartoon but is a standard beat em up. Let me explain the problems i had faced-Facing an army of invaders is a common theme in a DC universe. Enemies attack earth and the hero(es) go out and fight back and save the innocents. They keep fighting until every enemy is defeated and the day is saved. What happens in DCU is you get given a quest ""Defeat X enemy"" and after the chain quest you are expected to leave the respawning invasion to continue their ramage. You feel a bit disapointed since you didn't really stop the invasion since the developers of this game give you the option to return and fight them.-Being a villian can be fun for a few days but it runs dry. You beat up heroes, Smash stuff and rob vending machines but you are a basic slave to other villians when you are commiting crimes. Want to rob a convience store? have to do a quest. Kidnap people for ransom? Nope. Destroy cities or buildings? Only small objects.Make your own deathray? Heck no, Go help some one who is more important.Want to (insert here), Answer will be no.-You are meant to change the fate of future but you feel more like errand boy who only don't help at the grand scheme of things. -To further progress you need to cough up money and unlocking a few stages don't mount up for any thing.

												DC Universe Online is a GREAT free-to-play MMORPG! It has loads of content(for PvP & PvE), lots of dungeons, raids and the PvP is balanced and has a few maps as well - which are quite cool. The character creation is so detailed and awesome as well. Overall this game is the BEST free-to-play MMORPG - if it weren't for the game's restrictions. If you are a free-to-play player you might not like these restrictions, but I'm okay with them. Such as a maximum of 1500(or 2000 if you buy smth. from the cash shop for at least 500 SC(that's 5€) credits for every character - and that's not much, also you have a lot less Broker, Banker and Inventory slots(again if you have spend at least 500 SC in the cash shop, you will receive a lot of Banker and Inventory slots for FREE, just because you have spent 500 SC - overall in the shop). If it weren't for that and many other restrictions I would give this game a 10/10, but since the developers hardly listen to their player base and there are some restrictions in the game(for end-game content) - I would rate this game 8/10. P.S. Restriction to the end-game content aren't all that much(they are CONCERNING PvE PLAYERS ONLY): - PvE: You can do 3/4 out of all the episodes per type of dungeons/raids(1/2/4/8 man), which means you can go up to Tier 3/4 if you are a free-to-play player, if you are a member OR have bought some/all of the DLCs then you progress to the most powerful Tier(currently 7 - May, 2015).- PvP: While in Arenas/Legends there are absolutely no restrictions! Even if you are a free-to-play player you can earn the BEST gear in-game for PvP(you can't buy it from the Cash Shop)! I am sure this may not appeal to all people, but just give the game a try! Believe me, as both a PvP and PvE addicted player I can tell you - this game is worth your time! Even if you are a hardcore PvE player just try the game and I am certain that you will most likely enjoy it!			"

												Ya know, I really really want to like this game. I really do. I don't mind the fact that you can't be the official super hero but can only make a character based off the super hero you admire. That makes sense or else you'd see like 900 batmans running around and a handful of Flashes.The problem stems from a handful of things. The first of course is the play to win aspect. It's pretty rampant. I understand that they need to make money somehow, but it's pretty over the top in this game. Secondly if you don't create a character that has flying as it's mode of transport (You can choose super speed, flying, jumping extreme distances, etc.) then you're pretty much walking at a snails pace. Last but not least is just how amazingly repetitive this game is. Every mission, every quest, every objective is essentially exactly the same. Kill x amount of this badguy. Defend objective x until the timer runs out, kill henchmen until the badguy arrives to take a package.Now don't get me wrong there is a lot that is good about this game. It's pretty, the character creation is really fun, and the costumes you can unlock are pretty cool. But overall I have to admit that as much as I wanted to like this game it just falls flat. It gets right to the finish line and just sits down and refuses to go any furthere........Unless you have $14.99+$14.99+$9.99+$5.99.....			"

												Not really sure what to say about this. I'm conflicted because the game is pretty fun to play, even if you're a solo player but it's all together pointless if you have no intention dropping any money on anything. The game feels like it's trying really hard to force you to spend money, near enough everything is locked behind a pay wall and that's just disgusting practice. There's no ""Luring you in"" either it's just ""No. Money. Or you get nothing"" instead of ""Hey try this feature out and if you like it, why not help us support the game""For an example, the most you can have in your wallet at any one time is $1,500. Anything over that goes in to your Escrow and 1500 can buy you next to nothing and anything it can buy you you'll likely have out-leveled in about ten minutes. This also means you can't really buy much from the Auction House either.Now ""Escrow Accounts"" are nothing new in F2P MMO's but at least in other games you are allowed a sufficient and substantial ammount of in game currency so that you don't feel like something as simple as purchasing items is locked behind a pay wall.You'll constantly spend your time thinking ""Oh that looks really cool"" or ""That's a cool idea"" and then go to try these things out only to be greeted by a plague of a paywall.Fun game held back by ridiculous pay wall. tries too hard to force you to spend money.

												If a ""thumb horizontal"" review was allowed, this game would get it. However, I'm a classic MMORPGer who actually liked most of the fantasy MMORPG ""greats."" Compared to them, this is thumbs down. This is an MMO-ARPG for PC and Console simultaneously- Adjust your expectations about gameplay and community accordinglyDecent graphics- Should run on any 2016 Windows gaming PC (uses Unreal3 engine)- Lacks modern polish (no advanced shaders)- Still looks good due to comic book visual theme (no photorealis tic texturing)Some AAA Polish- Extensive opening movie- Cinematic cut-scenes - Lots of voice-over during low levelsCaptures the superhero ethos well- You can create your own superhero, extensive costumes and powers- Communicates the DC superhero ""world"" well- Appropriate tongue-in-cheek scripts- Multiple level-up paths to 30, with slightly different voice-overs, missions, etc.A dev team still exists- game originally built by SOE and sold to Daybreak Studios in early 2015-- some people from SOE moved to Daybreak- game design fixes/adjustments have been made over the years- releasing new episodic content-- Must subscribe  or pay to get this content (see F2P limits below)UI is badly explained- tutorial is inadequate: too much glitz, not enough teaching- no manual- web and wikis often outdated (multiple game system changes since 2011 launch)- Current players often have difficulty explaining detailed game mechanics-- Players are a poor substitute for an up-to-date manual or wikiLearning curve is gradual until you start doing group content- Post-level-30 teams and guilds (leagues) can be harsh, be prepared for ugliness- See community and teams below for details""Mouselook"" control method familiar to FPS players- but viewpoint is 3rd person - you see your character- moving around in open world, especially flying, can be awesome- movement controls have clunky design decisions for strafe and backward movement-- work-arounds exist, but they're clunky; somebody should shoot the designers (oh, yeah, they did)Combos are major part of combat- mouse button ""tap"" and ""hold"" mean different things-- for example, combo could be left-tap, right-hold, right-hold-- variable internet lag can wreck combos - you need a stable connection to play- can learn multiple weapon types, each weapon has separate combo specialsMain game begins AFTER you reach level 30- a lot post-level-30 content is 2-, 4- or 8-person missions, although some solo does exist- high level content often has gear requirements, you must ""qualify"" for advanced missionsCommunity ""quality"" is mixed- PUGs will kick people mid-mission to improve their own rewards at the end- Guilds (""leagues"") are often elitist, requiring significant post-level-30 gear just to join- Console players alongside PC players = poor communication, culture clashTeam missions REQUIRE teamwork: - Tank, healer, controller, damage are designed-in team roles (character classes)- Must know what is expected of your role, and play that role on a team- Be prepared for bad experiences in PUGs (pick-up groups)Remaining player base is small- PC and playstation players on two servers (NA and EU)-- Xbox players combined into one server for NA and EUIf you spend money, even just once, the game has built-in voice support- Most leagues and teams expect mic and voiceNo open world PvP- server mergers have removed all open world PvP servers- gankers who loved open world PvP also goneF2P has significant limitations- DO get plenty of gameplay to judge the game-- No need to decide in two hour refund window-- You get a variety of superheroes who can level up to 30-- Vast array of superhero clothing available for free, colors also free- NO need to constantly buy consumables or playing time- Do NOT expect access to the whole game for free-- You must pay to access the full range of possible superhero types (powers)-- You must pay to access most post-level-30 content-- Money accumulation limit ""escrows"" excess income until you subscribe- Access to entire game requires either a $15/mon subscription or large one-time purchase-- one-time purchase costs about $190 to almost equal a sub-- Even the $190 purchase still results in certain limits, publisher WANTS you to subscribe			"

												Well, you can see from my playtime that I've given the game a fair shake. I was also a member of the PS3 beta and I've done my best to love this game since the start. Pros:- Great action combat. I find it as, if not more, intuitive than Tera (personal preference, let's not have a flame-war).- Great performance. Can play in 4K/ 60 with all sorts of additional razzle-dazzle forced through Nvidia control panel.- Lots of instanced content.Cons:- Almost no over-world content aside from races and collection hunting. Once those activities are done, you sit in your base or League Hall and wait on ques/ LFG spam.- Hideously toxic community. I don't think that ""console kids"" can be blamed soelely for this. In a DPS-centric game (support roles are essentially on the brink of extinction and all content is to be burned as quick as possible), people have simply lost the patience to try, talk tactics, or do anything that slows down their nuking of bosses.- Replay ponzi scheme coupled with DOUBLE RNG=Worst loot system since Alloids maybe? So, here's the deal, you beat normal content to access Elite content, which ***can drop epic loot that when paired up with other pieces of a set can give you special bonuses. Sounds great, right? You kill a boss and get two rolls, exclusive to your character from a table of 20ish things, each with varying degrees of rarity. Perhaps an ""elite"" piece is on there, sometimes two. It's never the one you want, and you need to collect FOUR, from an instance that SHARES THE SAME LOOT LOCK AS THE NORMAL VERSION OF THE RAID (Here, we've arrived at the replay scheme). It costs 87 replays to unlock a raid and you get about 4 raid unlocks for every $10 you spend. Oh, and there's no other means to aquire top end gear other than to raid/ elite raid. Vendor gear is welfare-ware.- It's prohibitive at this point to play without a sub, there's too many instances and you need them all to level since your rewards are capped between tiers: you can't skip tiers by gearing up, since you need a basic, rising ilvl--""CR"" in this game--to move up a tier. I always sub, so that's not a problem, but don't think you can roll a new toon as a ""premium"". It will take forever.- Nothing but the gear treadmill. So after all that, and with a myriad of complex combat systems, bases, base-mods, henchmen and all the other crap you can do for your toon, it's nothing but a gear race, which is done ad nauseam for ONE new 4 or 8 man piece of content EACH month, for a 3 month cycle. With loot locks and all the other stuff. Even if you try and exploit the RNG system through replays, there's still RNG in play so you have no chance of getting anything over James the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who dies in every boss fight then ends up with a legendary belt and other rare loot on every boss for his troubles (well, the group's troubles).- The developers have no clear roadmap that doesn't revolve around dps-tweaking. Loot systems are a mess. They introduced an R&D system that no one uses because the costs are so prohibitive. You get 1-2 new pieces of content that are both the only thing relevant, as well as mind-numbingly boring after a week since you are locked out of any other insteresting content by your--at this point inflated--CR.- The Toxicity. This deserves two mentions, since the stuff you see in chat is ENTIRELY unmodded. Imagine Barren's chat, only with the venom and hatred of today. You actually don't have to imaine that if you play DCUO. All GMs are offline that I've seen, except for when one of the developers pops on a toon, feeling lonely, and wanders into the Watchtower from adulation from their dwindling fanbase.5 years of playing and the game has only gone incrimentally and now precipitously downhill. The entire thing is based on replays and on squeezing and already starved, tired playerbase for every replay-dollar they can. In my wildest dreams, I'd like to see them turn this Titanic around, although--and continuing with that analogy--they've already hit the iceberg and the Captain and crew are too full of champagne and delerious to think the impact was anything more than the flip of their drunken stomachs. They'll be singing and dancing all the way under the waves. Don't touch this game with someone else's computer--even if you hate that person. It's too cruel.			"

												I’ll start by saying this seems like an enjoyable game, fun and alluring…for a few of days.With that said ends the nice stuff.Starts off by an excruciatingly long, and I mean long, game installation process.After you’re done with that, you enter the most insanely money begging “free” game I’ve ever seen.I understand the concept of “free to play” games.Naturally the companies want to obtain profit and will implement secondary features that will tempt you into paying (character customization, cuter weapons and gear even with better stats, etc.).This game, however, is in a whole different level.No secondary features here, you have to pay for literally everything that is decent:-Inventory size (something that doesn’t fill up in 1 minute of playing)-Gear that doesn’t make you look like every other free player-Extra character slots, beyond the whopping 2 you get free-Access to main features, without which you’ll just be a clown flying around pointlessly-Even loot you constantly get everywhere that only opens if you pay up-In summary, every attractive aspect of the game, pay up or no-can-doAnd you might think “I might pay up if I’m interested”.Not when you see the price…OMG…What in the world possesses these people to ask such amounts of money for 12 months of premium access, amounts you can easily use to buy 2 other good recent games (no I’m not joking).If you still want to try sure, it its “free”, enjoy the 3-5 days you will be able to endure it.

												First of all I'd like to say I used DCUO with steam around 2011/2012 until they bugged the marketplace and I wasn't able to buy stuff through Steam version of DCUO, so since I have been playing directly through the DCUO client than steam and my hours here are shown to be lesser than what it actaully is. It won't be less than 8000+ hours for sure.Anyway, DCUO used to be good before back in 2011 and 2012 when all gear and powers used to be somewhat balanced. There was grinding to be done and weekly raids that reset every Thursday.  Late 2012 they introduced replay badges which allowed players to reset instances anytime they wanted, due to this a lot of players spent replays and got gear fast then left the game because there was not enough content left.  They had this checkmate gear which for first few months was only available for DLC users and was grindable through replay badges.DCUO has a very small development team and used to be a part of Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) which got sold this year to Daybreak Games. The company who bought SOE is an investment company and does not really care about the game crowd I think. Even during the SOE era the game started going downhill because 1) The Devs are too short sighted 2) They don't have enough budget. They constantly release updates and break things that aren't broken and in the process break even more things. Constant nerfing and buffing of powers so people will pay 10$ and switch to the Flavour of the Month power and do high Damage. Weapon mastery and Advanced mechanics ruined the fun gameplay aspect of everything in PvP and PvE. Instead of creating your own rotations its just do a certain rotation (some just created macros for this and spam in raids) and you will blow the scoreboards, reusing old maps for new DLCs. Now the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥ update of them all ""You won't get marks for an instance that's lower Tier than your current Tier."" So if you are Tier 7 you won't get marks for helping out or doing Tier 5 or 6 raids. This game tries every cheap tactic in the book to get that penny from your pocket and not give the crowd what they want. They cater to noobs or casual players or maybe thats just an excuse to pull out those shiny things from your pocket. After 4 years of gameplay not only did this game manage to get its playerbase into Half but released 47 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ updates that broke things rather than fix anything.I will be a DCUO fan which was released in 2011 not the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ money grabbing waste of space with no quality it is now. Its not a game where players create a decent Comic based character with own concept now, its about whats the hot stuff in town and make a character with that power. I'm not sure why DC would allow such ♥♥♥♥ bags to run a DC licensed game for them.			"

												Played this for a while and really like it. I dont play MMOs to much but I do like coming back to them once a year for a few weeks or months. I would like to say the same for this game but when I reinstalled it and loaded it up and logged in I was very happy to see my list of characters ....not there. I had to creat a new character and start over. once I got out of the first mission i looked to see the character list and there was my 2 characters waiting for me. They were resticted and I had to reactivate them for 15$ each. Are you joking? Im about to just uninstall this again and not come back because my hard work in this game is gone and the memories i had are gone. DCUO killed my heros and I wont start over and play the same missions over and over. ♥♥♥♥ that im out.			"

												The biggest Pay-To-Win Game God has created. The game is practically programmed for the player to buy their consistant content in order to progress. customization is behind a pay wall. extra missions is behind a pay wall. The game urges players to buy all their DLC content which you may have difficult even trying to play since some of them require 2 - 4 players in order to access them. Community is caustic and  dont even wanna play with you, cause your a complete stranger..... Duh. This game is a complete joke, you don't even feel like your own character is someone special. Its a a game made up of just pure grinding levels. The PvP is just ""whoever bought more levels from daybreak wins"".  Batman, Superman, and other DC comic superheroes show no emotions when sending you on a mission and even certain missions you play are just tasteless and not exciting. In regards to Heroes and Villains, the missions are practically the same. For example the Queen Bee mission. heroes and villains practically play the same mission and In regards to the tier missions, you can only do them once and cannot repeat them for a certain amount of time. But you can replay them if you pay in game, which is complete nonsense. In conclusion, do yourself a favor and NEVER play this game.			"

												i reccomend this game for anyone who likes to be a leader in mmos, im not much of a follower but if you want to get anywhere in this game you have to abbide by others and the way they play this game. Some points it is hecktick to do things only one way, if you play well with others cool but in this game there are too many guild people who think they know everything, If you find me in game i will provide a fair opportunity for everyone, i dont reject people because of there lack of experience on levels, which is a problem for a lot of people who just want to enjoy the game. So again this game is great if others can be less selfish about the guild rules, joining rules and raid rules.   P.S. ENJOY LIFE ITS TOO SHORT TO PUT UP WITH SELFISH PEOPLE IN A GAME.			"

												This isn't meant to be a full game review, but I'm pretty disapointed to return to the game after a long absence only to find that DB cash can no longer be used to unlock content DLC.  So if you had Station Cash or whatever DB has changed it to, it no longer works for any of that.It's a real shame since I had 3k saved for my eventual return and it's worthless as I care not for cosmedics, toys, etc.			"

												While the game is fun to play, at later levels it becomes a farming grind that'll require cash to advance. Then there's the times that all your account info including the fact that you paid for DLCs will mysteriously vanish and customer support is hard to find. Then you also hear about people complaining about this finding themselves banned for doing so. Frankly, if you haven't tried the game and been pulled into it yet, AVOID IT and go for Vindictus or something.			"

												I love MMOs, and I love comics, but this game... it had such potential.  With a stable like DC and the Justice League behind it, this should have been the end-all of comic MMOs.  But, sadly, the super-ball was dropped.Setup is easy, character creation is easy- about the only difficult thing is leaving the game to patch overnight and then trying to find a character name that isn't sitting unused on someone's account.  That, however, is where the feeling of making your own hero ends. The story starts up- Lex Luthor has come from the future, spinning a tale of a universe subjugated by Brainiac, and he's brought gifts for everyone- exobytes that end up infecting hundreds of thousands of people with superpowers (the PCs).  The Justice League is asked to train the heroes, and the Legion of Evil is tapped to train new supervillains.  What that essentially means is you get tagged to handle everything that they feel is beneath them- you never really get to feel like a hero or villain- instead of Batman, you'll get to be one of the Robins, but in a different costume.  You get told to go here and help someone- it just doesn't feel like you get to be the hero or the villain- instead, you're a piece on a board that both sides are playing off against each other.  Think of it like three-sided chess- the heroes and villains battle each other, but both know that if Brainiac wins, everyone's out of luck.Honestly, there's a solid game in here, but the presentation needs a lot of work- if I want to be a hero, I don't want to be treated like the sidekick- I want to get out there and save the day from villains, not clean up their mooks and wait for some other hero or villain to swoop in and finish the job.If the DC thing is important, grab this.  If not, grab Champions Online.  Simple as that.			"

												So everyone, i would like to let you know that this is an incredible game with some nice feature and a lot of opportunities.DC Universe Online is the best super-hero MMO you can find on the internet; it has:+ Nice graphics+ iconic characters+ a lot of features+ fun and so on...But i also have to mention a BIG negative aspect, where i was really sad when i found out what DCUO really is:> It is definitely not a full ""Free 2 Play"" gameIt is more likely a game where you can play till you reach a Cr of 84 and then you have to stop playing.Why? Because YOU HAVE TO PAY AFTER IT. I'm not informed of the max Cr you can get in DCUO but i know that it is higher then 175 so i'm really disappointed that you have to pay, to get better. I mean, a Cr of 84 isn't bad at all, but it's just the half Cr of what you can really reach in DCUO.Conclusion:Nice graphics, nice featueres, get it, have fun, reach lvl 30 but just stop after you reach a Cr of 50 or sth. because it is a waste of time, when you really want to play a game for free!

												So, DLC ehhr I mean DC Universe Online is a good game.The game revolves around brainiac invading earth, in the minst of battle with Lex Luthor Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman get killed and without any heroes to defend earth, it gets overrun.Lex Luthor goes back in time and warns the heroes previously mentioned about the danger the future holds, and releases an exobit which allows normal people to get powers. This is where you step in, creating your character hero/villain.Depending which mentor you choose will depend on your city of operations (Batman/Joker=Gotham, Superman/Lex Luthor=Metropolis and so on), the combat varies on melee and ranged attacks with a few unlockable combos and powers.Pros: Interesting idea         Detailed worlds         tons of character customization options         Lots of comic book lore         fun combat         ok storyline         tons of collectiblescons: Occasional server crashes and force closing          They didn't cut back on the dlc, but it is f2p after allFinal score: 8/10			"

												I have at least 3k hours on this game as I didn't use it with steam until early last year. This game was also owned by SOE until about a year ago.As it stands now; the game is fantastic.... until you hit 30... Then its unstable, pay to play(freemium), poorly maintained mess. The core game was never intended to go past tier 2 raids, which ended 3 years ago. Classes have been dumbed down so much and removed a large portion of any skill factor the game had left. Bugs that have been in the game since launch persist. A dwindling, elitest(am somewhat guilty myself) community is not suited for new players. That and massive pay walls for any relativley new content + the ability to access features needed for upper tier content are a major turn off for a game rapidly loosing all appeal.Daybreak did throw some life back in the game. More costume options and lair decor. But it simply stalls the realization that the game isn't fun anymore.			"

												I'm really mixed about this one.....THis game has serious paywalls. I mean, over half the content is unplayable without a membership, (WHich by the way, is 15$ a month) But, MMO-Wise, has one of the most enjoyable gameplays i have come across. Then again, pay a simple 5$ on any item you want, and you become 'premium' like Membership, but less rewarding and permenent.My recomendation? Go Premium. Dont like the game? Quit. It's only 5$ Like it? Spend a little more, or think about wether a membership is worth it.In the end, the game IS free, so why not test it out?			"

												DCUO is a very enjoyable game.I would caution anyone who throws too much time into the game as there is certainly a pay wall after a certain point.It also depends on what you're looking for. If you want to bomb around as your own hero then this is definitely a game you will enjoy. If, however you're looking for a continuous evolving mmo experience set in the DC universe, this will have portions which are dissapointing to you.			"

												This could be a great game, possibly in the top 5 MMO's of all time.  But it has critical problems that make it unplayable.  First of all, more than half of the time I cannot login.  There is always some technical issue with logins as evidenced by the Daybreak Games twitter account.  If you can't login, you can't play.  There have been multiple issues with this that seem to pop up way too often.There is little to no user engagement in regards to technical problems.  There is never an announcement on when the issues will be resolved, what the issues are, and no recompense for them.  Even a little game benefit like a little extra currency (marks of valor, legend, or one of the other numerous currencies in the game).  Customer service is basically nonexistent.  We are ordered to go to this help website that provides no actual help, just some FAQ's that have nothing to do with technical issues.  Since I'm not a rich person and $15 a month of entertainment is very much factored into my budget, I'm going to have to cancel. If I cannot play the game more than half of the time, it's not worth it.  If a company cannot keep up on server maintenance nor does not care about the level of satisfaction of their customers, the product isn't worth any money.  It's so sad, because I truly love this game, almost everything about the experience in the game is extremely fun.  But I just can't handle being unable to login every other day.			"

												TL;DR - Was a great game.  Not enough to keep me playing.  The F2P model is too gimped for me to justify playing, tired of paying sub, since I've been on since launch.  Still a great game for new players, but not enough going on to keep me into it I think...Well, as someone whose played since launch years ago, I guess it's time for my thoughts.  The game has made a lot of changes since the beginning, not all of them for the better.  Hacking was terrible in the beginning, so I almost never played PVP.  And when the population dwindled to almost nothing, I considered hacking just so I could run high level content, becuase there was no one on to group up with, except the aforementioned hackers playing PVP only.Then came the Megaservers, which saved the game in my mind.  Finally I could run group content without waiting for the weekend.  I WAS AN IDIOT FOR PASSING UP ON THE LIFETIME SUB AT THIS POINT!Then came F2P.  Game was rough for the first week.  Then it got better.  But this is where it went mostly bad.  Players would rush to level 30, then camp the starting areas.  So you couldn't make alts and start leveling them in PVP zones.  So I had to log on to my main toons, and wipe all of these clowns so others could level.  At the risk of sounding selfish, I got bored of that becuase I didn't gain anything from it, having accomplished all the open-world pvp feats.Then they began lowering the marks it takes to get T1 and up armor.  No biggie, but as much time as I spent gaining currency to get this armor, and I kind of felt burned for it.  Yes it made getting armor for my alts easier, but still, all that time in the beginning spent farming marks.The only two reasons I still play is because I'm hoping for a few more power sets, and there's one last patch I'm stoked for:  When you've unlocked at a cosmetic sytle, it's unlocked for all your characters!  I have wished for this forever.  No more farming currency to buy multiples of a style then mail them to my alts.  So this has got me excited.  But no word when that's coming.Bottom line:  The F2P model is too gimped for someone who paid sub for a long time.  Most of the people I used to play with are gone.  I have some cool names for my toons becuaes I made them in the beginning.  It may be my favorite game of all time, but it is definitely my favorite MMO ever.  If they offer the lifetime sub again I may bite.  But it might be time to put this one to bed...			"

												This game has some very nice combat for an MMO as it makes you more involved, and in my opinion it handles customization very well, maybe even the best of any MMO. as far as story, you don't experience too much of it during play, its mostly, ""go beat up 15 of these, good, now go beat up some of the guys over there"" and it gets a tad boring to me. There arent any twists or turns, and you always seem to be doing something irrelevant to the ultimate goal of stopping Brainiac. I never felt i am my own super hero and that i am more of a side kcick as im always fighting someone elses villain, and be issued commands from the likes of batman and superman. it wouldve been great had you also been able to pick from multiple super powers. It also seems as though that for a game heavily emphasizing free to play, the majority of end game and side content are there in the form of dlc, such as housing modifications, chooosing super powers, and even a movement style. In all honesty, i feel you should play a different MMO.			"

												5/10 at the most.Used to be way better than it is. While DCUO was never a GREAT MMO, it didn't used to be a shameless cash-grab. It's LITERALLY pay-to-win . You can pay real-world money to immediately take any character (even a brand-new never played level 1 character) immediately to Combat Rating 100 and start raiding. More than a little bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, in my honest opinion.Now, this game isn't TERRIBLE if you can overlook the shameless micro-transactions, cancerous community, hilariously overpriced DLC, and negligent developers. If you can ignore all of that, there's a pretty damn great game struggling to free itself from beneath the immense pile of crap and garbage.-The powers are fun to use (and pretty varied).-The different weapon styles (while not particularly well balanced) are darn fun to mess about with.-The storylines you can play through in the base-game aren't as poorly written as lots of people claim they are. If you suspend real-world logic, some are pretty cool. (Note: DCUO is all set in pre-New 52 DC continuity so Superman is still his good 'ol pure-morality self).-The game-world is, actually, pretty big for a game of its age. Not nearly as big as City of Heroes' was, or WoW is but still. The ability to mess around in Metropolis and then be able to punch people in Gotham City's seedy underbelly is a very nice touch. Full cities, too, with no loading screens once you transition between them.-In my genuine opinion, I think the leveling process is this game's real strength. Do I recommend you pay for the DLC? No, not really. The base-game offers more than enough content to keep you busy for a while and the free powers you have access to aren't Underpowered by any means so you can still compete with players who paid for the DLC powers.-The game really falls-off, for me, when you get to level-cap. You get a quick tour of the basic dailies and stuff, shown the fancy raid armour you can buy with marks and just left to your own devices. The game doesn't do a very good job of telling you what you're expected to DO when you reach level 30. Plus, if you don't have any DLC and you don't plan to buy any in the future, it's not really worth putting the effort in to actually EARN the fancy raid armour unless you like the look of it. I mean, there's just no incentive to go out and grind out dailies for a month or two without the DLC packs.It's FTP so, in my opinion, even though there's LOTS of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ things about DCUO, it's genuinely worth a try if you're a veteran of City of Heroes. It's not nearly as good but it's clearly trying to be a spiritual successor. It's not going to blow your socks-off and you're probably going to lose interest after reaching level-cap but there are a LOT of FTP MMOs on Steam right now that are WAY worse than DCUO. Worth a go on the base-game but don't invest money into it unless you're 100% committed and have lots of spare cash to spend, otherwise you'll find yourself broke pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ quick.			"

												So after some time in the game I think I can write  review it.To begin with this game has the potential to be one of the best mmo's of all time (imo) but its grealty held back by the developers greed. This game is free to start, if you want to go any where you need to either buy the ""episodes""(Also don't buy the episodes it's not worth it) or get membership btw is expensive at a insane $15 a month with different plans that go down to $11 a month for a year. It's the same on console but for console if you have PSN or Xbox Live it's free I don't get why they can't work out some sort of a deal for PC. There are many ways PC players can support this game but no change has been said on that (I tried to get memebership but it required you to have a credit card and steam wallet money won't pay for it) But if you are willing to cough up the $15 per month then by all means play if you want, but if not, don't waste your time geting invested into the game just to be dissapointed 20 hours in. Don't get me wrong I love this game I want it to be better but right now , I can't recomend it. "

												It's been over a year and a half since I first started playing DCUO, note that I started on the PS3 and not on PC (I actually prefer PS3). I started off with a healer and no idea what in the world to do, now among my PC and PS3 I have about 8 characters from people that control electricity to mastering space and time, even some Lanterns. Yeah the game is a bit monotonous at first, nothing that doesn't change really quick once you get up in levels. Like every other MMO out there you have to pay to get the good, late game stuff but the good thing about this game is that even if you're free to play you still have a bunch you can do later on regardless. This game is by far one of the best MMO games I have ever played, hands down. If you don't try it you're arguably missing out on the best MMO out there.11/10 Much Worth ItSo ReccomendOh, and a little piece of advice to all you who wanna try it out. Be a hero, trust me. It's better.			"

												its a fun game for a while, but once you reach max level and do literal all the missions in the game, after like a day, it turns into a grind fest. most the DLC requires you to have at a decent combat raiting to even access, even if you own it you cant even vist the map, which is gained through gear that you have to grind the same few missions over and over and over to get the marks to buy a single piece of a set after you get enough of a set or a whole set you combat raiting is high enough to access the next set of missions to grind to get a higher set of gear, about your 3rd set of gear your high enough to start acessing DLC.overall its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bussines model for a game, clearly designed for a console, short entertainment life without friends playing with you and that only exstend its a little longer. The fact is free to play now and you get to see the DC universe with some of the style of the justice league cartoons are the only things going for it.			"

												I have played this game on ps4 and liked it a lot, super fun game. However, I cannot recommend this game as it is a money trap on the part of the developers. I redownloaded to purchase and play with rage skills, knowing I'd had to purchase the add-on pack (first bummer). The thing that really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, however, was the fact that each new power is 600 coins, but coins are only sold in 500 or 1000 groups, so you have to spend 10 dollars regardless of how you go at in order to purchase a new power. This type of action by money-grabbing developers is what's wrong with the video game industry these days, and I now have no interest in playing since I'm being scammed before the game even starts.

												I played this game with 2 of my buddys. I still remember when he found this game. I thought ""This looks stupid, it's going to suck. I'm not downloading it"" After about 2 days or so of hearing them laugh and cut up and have a good time. I gave in and downloaded it.This was my first MMO game I ever really played and enjoyed everybit of it. I was playing when SOE owned it. Don't  be fooled from my played hours via steam I never played through steam. I remember when we hit level 30 and said ""What's next where max level?"" Little did we know the game was just beginning!Some nice guy gave me a purple piece of armor and all my friends were stoked and we though I just got one of the most highest gear possible. Boy was I wrong! This game is very fun if you have some buddys too play with! We started from scratch and ended up at the highest Tier possible for the game at that time!I remember many nights of raiding and many attempts at the same raid too just complete it!Somebody taught me about SubAvatars and too attain that gear. Boy we thought we was rolling in high cotton, at that time!*Which we was :)*I highly recommend this game if you're going too put time and effort into it.It's a very great game, and you can enjoy every minute of it!The only con about the game I think is the cash limit for people without legendary.You pretty much have too have a legendary subscription too really enjoy the game at the max potential.Even if you own the DLC's you still need money and all that other junk.So if you're a new player thinking about trying this game I highly suggest you too.Just take my advice and don't buy a legendary subscription right as you start the game.Wait atleast you are level 30+ and have got most of the highest gear possible befure you need too get into other duos/alerts/raids etc.Most of the time you can find groups that are highly over-leveled for that instance. And can run you through with no problems. And work on Skillpoints they make your character.-runs			"

												This is one of my favorite games of all time. I have not played that much on the PC version but on the Ps3 i have well over 2500 hours,maybe more. The game is a great game to play with friends and the community is great. The only downside to this game is if you want to continue playing it past a certain point you will have to invest money into it. Now dont get me wrong it is very worth it but i can tell you once you spend the money for a months membership, it will be the only game you play for the next month,so yes it is highly addicting.

												This game is a hideous failure. wait... no trolling. my reasons are:1. This game was originally made by SONY with DC's permission.2. They had the best artists and code writters on their team.yet, cryptic studio's Champions online is far supperior?More customization options, more costume peices, the ability to use more than three colors...More PvE content, and yes... SOLO PLAY.Hell, I will go so far as to say ""City of Heroes"" was better than this mess.I just wish I could get these superhero games mashed together to have millions of costume peices, powers, and special effects. I wish someone would make a superhero game where I can CREATE MY OWN heroes with my own power ideas and so on. In short a superhero game that would be worth a damn...			"

												Pretty fun until you get to the late game content, then it drops off quite steeply. In hind-sight it's not worth the membership or spending the money, but leveling up to 30 will surely tempt you to purchase the other available content. DONT DO IT. The later solo dungeons have you playing as other heroes so what's the point in getting so familiar with your own? (not-so-bright game devs) ? At max level (combat rating) there's hardly anything challenging for you to fight - including the daily quests, and the dungeons and raids become more scarce, meaning less to do basically and what there is to do isn't fun anymore. Most of the dungeon bosses have the same queer mannerisms that look totally NOT like a super-villain... Anyway, I enjoyed reaching level 30 far more than I enjoyed the game at 128CR. The community sounds more mature than your usual MMO (plus), and there's lots of side quests to make exploring the world fun... but I don't think I needed to spend the money I did to get the most enjoyment out of the game because after a certain point it just ISNT as fun, and a lot of that has to do with poor design (lack of creativity/common sense) on the part of the developers - which in computer talk = move on they have no idea what they're doing.

												First of all, i've like 300h+ in this game, much more than my Steam acc says.This MMORPG is fun, not a Mozart's Requiem nor a Einstein's Relativity Theory, but still fun, not that addictive (Big con for me when comes to a MMORPG), awful in some ways, it's a little bit p2w (you can play this game and have great fun with it without paying a single dime), BUT in a 80% sale you can buy the Ultimate Edition very cheap, although its has a monthly subscription, it's not important at all, only the expansions are important... However this game has its strong points. Pros: - DC fans will love it, its very faithful to the DC Comics, great stories attached to instances/dungeons, awesome atmosphere, great voice acting. (that alone made me play this game for hundreds of hours)- Singleplayer (Real-time) game combat system applied to an MMO for the first time (about damn time).- Biggest freedom sensantion ever in an MMO.- Synergy between abilities and skills are INSANE, makes you think what and when to combo/crowd-control, if you're a Brainiac (see what i did there?), you can be almost invencible at PvP, cuz 90% of players are morons at those synergies...- Very intuitive, almost impossible to get lost.- HUGE amount of customizations for your character, not only in the creation, but ingame.  Cons: - Terrible interface, awful.- Steep learning curve, specially at PvP, makes people quit very often, since PvP is open world present almost all the time.- Queue system for Alerts/Raids/PvP are broken, estimated wait time 0% accurate.- Matchmaking for Alerts/Raids/PvP are dreadful or non-existent, certain necessary roles aren't present sometimes (lel) and you easily could be matched with a full team of non-experienced players against a full team of experienced players, so amusing. :)- Chat system: Bleeeuuurrrggghh!- Not that addictive for an MMORPG. (For me it's a con for some ppl it's a pro, haha)- I love leveling up my character, it's one crucial thing for me in every MMORPG, and DC Universe Online have the worse level cap i've ever seen, a non-experienced player could cap his character in few days.- Pay to win in some way, but at least a cheap one. I feel like the bottom line here and what makes this game fun or not is how much do you like DC Comics, as of myself i'm a fan, i love DC, but i couldn't make my friends play it cuz they're not familiar with the atmosphere, that being said, i only recommend it, if you're familiar with DC Comics in some way.I would say this game is a 7/10.P.S.: I really don't know how accurate my review is considering i don't play this game since SOE became Daybreak (worst company of all time), but i'm assuming it hasn't change that much.

												i knew this game would be huge considering its a superhero mmo and thats incredibly great and  i think what is also amazing is the ability to create your OWN superhero and to enjoy the view with the ability to fly like superman,run like the flash, and do many toher things YOU CAN ALSO BE BEASTBOY!!!!!!. wel... you man transform into animals like what beastboy does if you choose nature as your power. you can also change the color of your skin to green too so you know beastboy right der.the like how you can use real super hero's or real villans constumes as a template for your own super hero's or villains costume i believe thats a major +.this game is a world of warcraft clone just the DC version. i love this game i love the superhero movies but i didnt think i would find a super hero game that i would enjoy so much but this is it. this game is free to play but however you can pay to get everything that the game has to offer or you can choose to buy the items or... dlc seperetly WITCH I THINK ITS VERY VERY GOOD THAT IT IS ALLOWED  because most people cant afford 15 dollars a month. ill give this game a 10/10 considering you can do world pvp and world pve and i think it's great thatr you guys added the system where you can keep a certain style of clothing that you liked for your cotsume. for people that want a mmo like wow and dont want to play star wars the old republic this game is for you because your character  and you arent going to be a clone unless someone copies you meaning they went to your house and looked at your stuff.

												Most things are DLC or premium only. The game has a great premise, but the gameplay isn't fun (kill 10 jobbers, defuse 10 bombs, collect 10 macguffins, etc.) and the customization is surprisingly limited. There doesn't seem to be a way to communicate with other players, either. Also, regardless of your alignment, you HAVE to fight Bane if you choose Gotham as your home city. Bane is IMPOSSIBLE to kill.			"

Product received for free
												tl;dr = Buggy launcher, Buggy controls, no regard for free to play players. It's free so try it for yourself but don't expect much. I would recommend Champions online instead.I first played DCUO way back at launch on ps3 and while it wasn't the best mmo ever and definitely wasn't as good as city of heroes. I still thoroughly enjoyed it. Back then I would have recommended it. Now however I definitely will not recommend it. First of all I couldn't even get it to install properly. The launcher would just randomly shut down without any warning while installing. I basically had to keep opening it, it would complete about 5% of the install and shut again but I kept going out of sheer nostalgia for this game.Eventually I got the game installed and created a character it was only then the real troubles started. The game makes all free to play users wait in a queue to join the server. The estimated wait time was 2 and a half minutes however it took 10 minutes to get it only to be instantly booted back to character select. Another 10 minute wait and I was back in the prologue only to find that the controls were absolutely atrocious. My character wouldnt turn properly, instead he'd just kind of run forward and gradually turn round while still playing the forward run animation. Sort of like the tank controls from the old resident evil games. I don't know if its a bug but I certainly don't remember movement being that clunky back on ps3.To make matters worse if you didnt move the camera while moving the character it would just flail wildy in random directions. Again I don't know if this is a bug or if they just messed up the controls when they ported it to pc. I tried searching online and found only one thread on steam of someone having this problem and absolutely zero solutions. The flying controls seemed a lot more responsive so I tried to push forward only to have the camera completely disconnect from my character while i was flying. I made sure the auto follow setting was on but it didn't seem to help. It honestly felt like I was playing an alpha version of the game. If you are a fan of DC then go ahead and try it. Maybe your experience will be a lot less buggy than mine but be smart and don't spend any money on this until you're sure it will work properly for you.			"

												Ok game not the worst I have seen. It has combat system that i like because It's interactive and fun but open world pvp is weird. Basically the game wants your money with all these DLC's kinda like Payday 2. Customization is ok but notextensive as I wanted. Getting max Level only takes few days of straight grinding quests. And queue-ing for missions is kinda a drag but the missions are pretty cool. Wouldn't recommend buying most of DLC because it's pretty expensive. As a F2p I recommend going for Nature so you can transform into a very fast dog or gorilla. If you want to pay I recommend the green lantern DLC that gives you green lantern if you're good side and yellow if you're on the villain side. Red lantern DLC is pretty good too I guess. Pay to enjoy lol You cant even have a superhero hideout unless you buy DLC. Solid 6 out of 10 a game is a game. "

												where do i start : i played this game over 5000 hours in 3 years (half of this on steam)all in all its a one of a kind game, the fight mechanics are unique and lots of fun and if it wasnt for the constand changes.......however i stopped playing after constant changes in same mechanics and in my opinion a dev team thats totaly disconnected from its player base and only interested into catering the winy people and farming you for moneyits free to play so they say but it realy is not becoz you can level up to 30 and then get access to raids/alerts from tiers 1 to 6, 1 to 3 on free account plus a little t4 alert and thats it you wil have to pay to get access to the rest and with you being new you wont buy 10 dlc so the only option is to go legendary for a monthly feealot of needed items are priced in such a way you need to be legendary to get access to them, or know some friendly players ofc who can give you stuff becoz trading is only for premium and legendary users in order to become premium you need to spend money atleast once, however if you dont want to pay you could stil get a few months fun out of this leveling up playing the lower tiers, be prepared for a few bugs mainly disconnects (followed with a 10 min ban becoz you left the game)			"

Not just the standard power 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1,1,1 etc....This game also modifies the ""iron triad"" to include controlers.

												I have a tad of history with this game.First off, I played the beta, and the game was downright so boring that I didn't touch it after the first hour or so. Character Creation was amazingly limited, the graphics were meh, and the bugs and stuff were beyond horrid.Now, the game is quite fun, still repetitive like mmos usually become, but quite fun.Pros: A decent amount of customization for your character, if you sub you get even more goodies. (From overly-buff Hulk like characters, to furry-clad Waifus who run around practically naked besides having fur to cover their more curious areas.Graphics are much better thanks to them releasing a PS4 version, everything looks purdy most of the time now.Gameplay is fun, plenty of both PvE and PvP options once you're high enough level.Plenty of DC Universe-ness, from the characters, locations, and even to some well-known voice-actors.Cons: Noticable Pay-To-Win/Subscription only content like stuff that you can't open in your inventory unless your a member, which can be annoying since the game is practically teasing you with premium-only items that are much better than the freemium items.Some of the Powers are also Premium/Subscription only, such as the Skidding power that makes you a wannabe Silver Surfer.All in all, still a good game if you're a fan of DC			"

												Extremely fun for quite a while. Makes you feel like you actually have your own hero. A lot of customization and you can have your own loadouts and weapons and powers. Honestly enjoyable for quite a while. Although after playing it for a long time it starts to get repetetive and annoying to play. Also devs for this game are pretty pathetic, but overall a fun game to get into.			"

												I really like this game, because I was looking for a good superhero game and champions online was a massive pay to win cash grab. At 1st I really thought that DC Universe Online was also a p2w. It does a really good job with the Archetype and character creation.			"

												After the first two weeks of playing my disabled mother who i got to play this game (whos in her 70s) got perma banned for 'hacking'. She asked me what hacking was. She tried to call the company and they said the GM could just do what they wanted. She tried to talk to the GM but he refused to change his stance. Total jerk. I wrote a forum post about all this to defend her, which got deleted, then also i got temprorarily banned so I quit playing. Told my wife we just need to boycott these people. We enjoyed this game, (including my wife) but the customer treatment of these guys is intolerable.			"

												To begin, I have had DCUO on OS3 for roughly 4 years with 800 hours played and on PS4 with about 100 hours.  Recently, I started is on PC and it is no different from console versions, so this review will apply to any system.  That being said, DCUO is a toss up in terms of well crafted, F2P MMOs.      For quite a time, Sony owned and maintained this title to be excellent.  Recently, it was sold to Daybreak and has struggled to maintain it's life.  People will call this game ""Pay to win"" and in some aspects, it makes sense but truthfully it isn't.  End game content can have some ""flavor of the month"" powers but for most solo and story play, all powers and roles are perfectly viable.  There is no distint ""best power"" in the game.        That being said, 6 are free at the beginning with 7 more being available as DLC for $35 for them all.  I have purchased all the powers and find that, though each is unique and requires different play styles, none are remotely required for PvE or PvP.      The game is notoriously buggy as of late (last 6 months), which is mainly due to DayBreak not maintaining QA and failing to listen to consumers.  They are still producing monthly content that is pretty good as far as story goes, so that's a plus.       Speaking of story, the one in this game is fantastic as well.  It incorporates DC's best heroes and really make good use of many of them.  If you're looking for a F2P MMO, this is never a bad one to play, but content is slightly hindered with pricewalls, even if they don't stop completion of the main story.			"

												Funny Game, Excelent Mechanics, The gameplay is fluent, you can move at the same time you are attacking and casting spells, instead of be a turret. But this game IS NOT FREE-TO-PLAY. The only way you will be able to enjoy this game is leveling the heroes, because when you get the max level and you have already spent lot of time playing is when you see that this game is not free.Don't loose your time and go Guild Wars 2 if you are looking for a real Free to play.

												Since I've put more than 2000 hours on this game I guess I can give my 2 cents about it. This game used to be good, it really does, my favorite at some point. But devs don't actually understand their own game (also, they act like children: if I don't like your opinion, gotta delete it and f*ck you). PvP is pretty much dead, just as villain side. If you really wanna play this game, keep in mind that you'll need to spend A LOT of money just for PvE experience. On my personal opinion, you can get more for less if you're aiming for a MMORPG, just like FF14. I already had lots of fun with this game, but its sad to say, this game is dead.			"

												Where do I start, whenever I think of the old days playing this game, I get some of the best nostalgia I can get, but looking at this game now, not so much. DCUO was such a good game back in the day, everything about this was perfectly fine, until Daybreak took over SOE. Now Daybreak, being money ♥♥♥♥♥s, releases a new episode (dlc) every month, they insist on buying a subscription, never have dlc on sale (SOE DID have dlc on sale every once in a while), and make the player spend money in every way possible. Now, the devs have gone too far, making far too many tiers (I thought tier 4 and 5 were the perfects tiers), always making new dlc so nobody plays the old ones, and finally screwing the loot system. So in conclusion, don't waste your time with this, and even now, it makes me sad to say: I don't recommend this game.			"

												I have played this game for a while now, i have a max level character and loved every second. Although This game gets kind of annoying when all you have is a free to play account, it makes up for that by supplying many options to make your character different from everyone else's. Combat is great, the simple left and right click with the number keys flows well and the game looks great. I spent at least 5 hours just running around the cities finding everything (while not trying to die) and it was a blast. If you get a couple friends and play through the game its loads of fun. 10/10			"

												This game is an amazing game. I have spent a considerable amount of time on it and can proudly say, I loved every minute of it. Whether you're a DC fan or not, this game has something for you. You can play as a Villain or a Hero, depending on your game play style. Even though it's a Hero VS Villain concept in-game, you will at times find yourself fighting along side each other in order to complete certain instances. There is open world PVP but not used as much as the PVP match-up system. There are several powersets and movement styles that can be used, I would explain them all in here but they are always adding more. The best way to find out is to experience it first hand and in-game. The guys at Daybreak games hold community driven events like ""FNL - Friday Night Legends"" which they broadcast on Twitch.tv. You start up with Brainiac as the ultimate bad guy, but soon come to realize that there is so much more happening! The PVP and PVE systems are lots of fun. It's not a case of click-spam or hack&slash, but forces one to use a combination of weapon attacks, power attacks and movement to ensure that you stay alive while protecting your group(s). The instances are broken into:PVE------- Solo events (1 user)- Duo events (2 users)- Alert eventsd (4 users)- Raid events (8 users)PVP------- Lair battles (1v1 / 2v2)- Arena (2v2 / 4v4 / 5v5 / 8v8)- Legends (1v1 / 2v2 / 4v4 / 5v5 /8v8)Even though it uses the Unreal III engine that, as we all know, is fairly pretty but cannot really compete with today's games gfx. Not that it effects the gameplay at all, the game itself is still lots of fun!If you're still unsure. download and join us!			"

												(I am reviewing this based on my past experience and not of the current status of the game, but it shouldn't be too far off. Maybe SOE being bought out changed a few things.)-TL;DR is at the bottom- Short and simple; The gameplay is nice, there's quite a nice customization with the clothing and gear in terms of the appearance (Color schemes are in a 3-color palette, it sucks). The Character Creation itself is moderate. There's a lot of choices to pick, but it's more of a ""quantity over quality"" type of deal. The faces are almost all similar with some actual unique choices. There's nothing like ""face-width/height/depth sliders"" to get a truly unique feel.Dialogue in the game has it's moments and is overall good, but rarely anything too memorable. You can have your character use every weapon type (except the shield. You gotta pay for that, why?) in the game if you so desire. The powers are also pretty unique in their own ways, but you basically only have access to HALF of what you could choose without paying. (I mean to say choices, not the skills/abilities in the powers themselves) The PvP feels very... fast-paced? You could end up on your ♥♥♥ before you even realize it even though the Combat is a bit stiff, but fun. I guess it's balanced, I haven't been involved in PvP enough to get a good, true feel for it. In my experiences though, I was able to turn the tables on a superior enemy when I played the tactics game.They have open-world PvP in the form of: duels, certain areas in the worlds pertaining to a type of gamemode, and your queue-type arena PvP gamemodes. This game is very wide-open, it has its little info-bits to find scattered throughout the worlds too and some unique things to find, like Batman or Harley Quinn in Gotham City. There's Gotham City and Metropolis for you to explore and go around, there's no level-restrictions in where you can go either. There's certain-level enemies scattered about in the world. A level 10 Hero/Villain can go run into level 1~99 enemies and be completely owned or get pretty much nothing from lower-level enemies.Yes, there's a Hero and Villain faction. Each has their own storylines even though they technically go through the same areas. It's basically like parallel universes. P2W elements? Well... From personal experience, I don't believe I encountered anything that was too overwhelming. ALTHOUGH, PAYWALLS... EVERYWHERE... Do you want to save up your monies to go a shopping spree? Well... ♥♥♥♥ YOU! :D GIVE US MONEY SO YOU CAN HAVE MORE THAN 1,500 of the in-game currency on hand! What about if you end up getting more money than the limit? It goes into a ""credit"" type of bank that you CANNOT ACCESS unless you pay for the MEMBERSHIP. With the Membership, the credits are accessed as if you had it on hand, that's it. And let me tell you, 1.5k currency IS NOTHING with the prices of items and gears when you get deeper into the game. Buying one item can take up half of that 1.5k. There's also a ""base/hideout"" you get for free whenever you progress through the game, ALTHOUGH... YEP, YOU GUESSED IT... ANOTHER PAYWALL... Assuming you want to get the most out of your home. There's features that are RIGHT THERE, but NOPE... ""PAY FOR THE DLC OR ♥♥♥♥ YOU!"" *sigh* There's also other worlds that you can go to, but... yeah. More DLC to BUY... Even when the portal to the DLC world is RIGHT THERE in the Watch Tower or the Villain's lair (I honestly forgot the name). You can get ""rare"" and powerful gears in the respective Hero/Villain HQs if you participate in PvP and other ways, might take a while, but still. Though... They might be meant for PvP... but I do remember some gears that work all-round.TL;DR Gameplay/Combat is nice, Character Creation of appearance/personality is a bit bland overall, but the gears/armors/weapons you can equip make up for it despite the color scheme being rather dumb... PvP seems balanced, though no restrictions on levels for who can play. ♥♥♥♥ Sony for all the damn paywalls everywhere, hopefully the game gets turned around with the change of hands. The game feels a bit gutted with all the DLC in your face. Overall, the game is alright. If the paywalls, outrageous DLC and restrictions get taken out, the game would be a solid 83/100. From my own experience, it's a 71/100. ""Play the game for yourself"" kind of deal. It's still a ""free"" game after all.			"

												This game is advertised as ""free to play"" but really isn't. Playing for free just means you get an extended tutorial and that's it. You want to do normal PvP? Well, good luck with that when you can't buy PvP gear since it goes 500 Cash above your 1,500 Cash limit. Run missions? Sure, but to play them all, you need to buy the DLCs. They cant send items through mail either. Premium isn's much of a step up. They have a 2,000 Cash limit and can send/receive items through mail, but I think it's only one item. This game is really a pay to win sort of game, and as much as I love the character customization (which powers are now seperate purchases from the DLCs unlike before), I have to say I hate the gigantic gap between free and unlimited players.Speaking of DLCs and powers, they are now seperate purchases, like I mentioned before. Someone could buy a DLC and get the missions, the power, and the weapon (if there is one) in one purchase, but now you have to spen about $10 for the DLC, then about $5 for the power or weapon. Kind of a let down for me.And sure, they are doing the whole unlocked content for a month, but it's just to make free players pay. Nothing is for the free players.""Free to play. Your way."" Not really.			"

												I LOVE THIS GAME. the gameplay is fun but it can get repetetive.  With dowloadable content, bases, all the different styles, and a lot of coop overall it is a well made game.  I actually have been enjoying it more after level 30 which is the cap in the game.  Your basically attempting to improve the combat rating for the game and trying to unlock all features and newer really nice styles.  There are so many options for making your own type of character.  The only thing i really wish the game would give us is choosing our characters powers and allowing us to have more options when it comes to grinding all the way to 30.  Truly a fun game and the community is great but from what i saw the villains side is really lacking on community.  They may want to consider offering bonuses for joining the villains.  It's really a matter of opinion when it comes to whether you will like it or not but if you love customizing characters, playing with your favorite dc npc's like batman superman and wonderwoman then youll love it like i do.

												Probably the only good free superhero game you'll ever find. There's plenty of free content, but you have to pay to unlock a lot of stuff.The graphics are great, and I've only encountered a very minor bug.The story line is great, but needs added to. It is super hard to continue get stronger after lvl30, but, even if you don't like the game after lvl30, it takes a long time to get there.The bosses are recognizable and fun to beat, and each mission is relatively unique. There is so much customation for your character in the beginning it's crazy.There are some extremely minor things that I find wrong: - The super heroes/villains that accompany you on missions are extremely weak, except in the beginning, which is when you really need the help. Some missions are really hard to complete as a controller, so if that's the way you choose to go be prepared to have to search for a group.- The superspeed glitch that makes you fall through the ground.- The falling player base.- The locked stuff, and the super high prices. If the game was $20 to unlock everything, then maybe we'd be talking, but it costs $60 to unlock mostly everything (not including all the extra episodes) and then a subscription to get everything else.- How the game limits you to 1500 in game money (not a lot, especially at higher levels) and then puts the rest in an inaccessible bank unless you buy the game.Ultimately, this is probably the best game I've ever played. Many people have started leaving because DayBreak, whoever that is, ruined something- I have no idea what it is, I just started playing -- but the game is AMAZING, and I can't even tell what they messed up.The thing I hate most about this game is that there hasn't been an update ever since I started playing, and there's no new content. I sincerely hope that daybreak gets working on this and makes it better than it already is.Thank you for reading my review, and get this game- Now.			"

												Game is really good and getting to the level cap is decent speed but the DLC spam holds it back. Massively.My only concern is the DLC spam for those who don't want/can't afford to do a subscription, along side the limit on cash for players who aren't subscribers.The game is great to get a really good feel if you like it or not during the main storyline depending on which person you go for and with three character slots, you can choose 3 of the 6 totsal mentors (3 villain, 3 hero). From this you'll be able to decide whether or not you'd want to play this game continuously and put in the money.When it comes to making characters, the only part I don't like is the DLC locking of powers and specific categorising.In game, you get two trees per power. My preference would be able to select a tree from two different powers (one being iconic powers) and have skill points for each power. This would allow for greater diversity for character utility during group activities.Overall, for me, DCUO is a game I can go back to, put in a payment of subscription and progress a bit and then stop when I'm bored. Its not a game I'd play all the time though, if they had a policy on lowering the price of a DLC for every year old it is then I'd consider playing more often. This means that eventually DLC will be free and accessible. It means more people will willingly stay on playing, its why I'd play World of Warcraft and put money towards playing it for a bit.			"

												The game is rather fun, I mostly play for the styles though. Depending on the type of mentor you have effects your questline, allowing you to create more than one character and discover the other mentor's missions, however there are only a few mentor-specific quests. The free to play content is rather limited though, and to do most things you'll need to be a Premium member, (spend money in something called the Marketplace) or be a Legend (a subscription). It's one of my favourite games, many different play styles, and keeps you busy with exploring the areas. The many skills and powers can keep the game fresh, giving each character a unique gameplay. There's one bad thing that pops to my head though, and that's the name DLCUO, considering most of it is DLC.			"

												With all this game has to offer, I still found myself wanting more. The level 30 cap is something I continue to approach rapidly, hitting level 19 in an evening. However, the experience is anything but dull. Some of the respawn timers may be a little too fast, leading to a constant bombardment of enemies to smash through. Plenty of fun to be had, just don't try not to do it all at once. I'd give it an 8/10			"

												I want this to be a yes.  I really really do.  The game is 100% money grabbing now.  With lack of newer content (hard content I should also add).  The game caters to newer players and middle fingers the older.  It's pay to play hidden by the ""free to play"" tag.  You have to buy the dlc or pay the monthly to really do anything.  If you want to be batman for a few hours then yes the game is fun.  But, without spending money you get stuck.  I played as a pay to play winner and they just kept adding more to the game forcing you to spend more money for stupid things like boxes.  That and the difficulty was ridiculously easy.  When you can play the game for four days and be facing the last current raids is really pathetic.  Look elsewhere for a mmorpg.			"

												Now, DC Universe Online is a game when you can eaither create your own superhero from scratch, or base it on a actuall superhero (eg. Batman Superman Wonder Women  Flash Green Lantern etc, etc). The plot is this, Lex Luthor makes an army of villans to destroy the heroes in the DC universe, wich he succeds with. But he realised what a monster he is, so he goes back in time to tell the justice league that he had killed them in the future. But he finds a even greater enemy known as 'Braniac' forming a even larger army to destroy the world. But lex luthor has stolen thes things called Exobites which he put heroes and Villans DNA into. So these exobites spread their DNA across the world Forming new Heroes an Villains. Now while branian is attcking, there are other villains like Bane, Joker, Scarecrow, Circe, Giganta, Gorilla Grodd, and heaps more to be discovered in Dc Universe Online!			"

												I found this game enjoyable to play. The DLC's are inexpensive, at $10 a piece, or you can buy the ultimate pack, and any DLC's not included for about seventy dollars, the price of a normal game. Has a free 2 play format that rather seems more like forced to pay, although thats any game these days. With some new additions this game has pretty decent longevity, although some times the prices for additions (such as armories) are not priced to sell. The game is easy to control especially for veteran PC players used to keyboard and mouse operations. The controls feel rather like Bethesdas Elder Scrolls four Oblivion. My conclusion is that with new DLC releases on the horizon is that this game will be around for a long time, bringing interested gamers a fun experience.Edit: The DLC and extra content is even cheaper now than it was when I started playing. Had I waited a mere year what I had paid seventy dollars for, would have only cost twenty.			"

												I reccomend plying this game ive played ever since a while after the f2p model was released and despite the fact ive left mutliple times i keep coming back if your looking for a storyline and level cap to get through this is the place and the story can vary depending on your mentor and wether your hero or villain faction and on note nowadays its the online superpower comic based mmo where you can play both heroes and villains, as for extended playability thats when it's time to start paying money around T2 as the limit on in-game cash is 2000 for premium players (those who have spent 500sc/£5 or more in the market have extra benifits without having to pay any more) and 1500 in-game cash limit for free to play you'll eventually need more than 2000 cash to repair higher tier armour so i recccommend if you plan on going further you will need to buy a month based or full year full membership which removes all limits and allows you to use the escrow (excess cash thats saved up by exceeding limit of 2000 while selling) to it's fullest meaning theres no limit to how much you can spend or accumilate also you'll have full access to the dlcs and powers+weapons but this only lasts as long as the membership is still valid once it runs out you can't use any excess characters or or the characters with powers from legendary status dlcs unless you have bought them permanently although if you havent you can always buy the dlc or buy legendary again to be able to play them again and also once legendary runs out you will have 2000 in-game currency the rest will be left back in the form of escrow.Overall i'd say the game for me is 8/10 stars due to the in-game currency limitations but i'd say that this game is f2p but any extension to the game won't be free as to keep it as a good game they need the sub-scription as funding in order to provide the best experience to their players.

												i have to say the game is fun, and you get to interact with iconic characters from the DC universe. It has some cool character customzations,  various enemies, decent fighting mechanic (as long you do not pick a brute as template)and i have to say not many games can switch from flying to walking so smoothly.  One thing that bothered me is that It looked like something a 12 year old would play, yet their was Red Lantern Guy Gardner, known to be one of the most brutal and gory characters in DC universe(still not as bad as Lobo). I would recommend this game, but if your like me certain minor things might ruin your feel for the game. Eye-sore color scheme costumes like purple and yellow, green and pink, and much more... set you on edge, You might want to skip this. The game is well done for a free to play, an if you like DC universe get it, but again (I KNOW IT SOUNDS STUPID) the color choices by some of the players in that community made me stop, Because i'm an OCD little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and i cant help it.

												This game is an okay FTP playthrough.This game is an AMAZING subscription MMO. Levels 1-30 are basically a tutorial as you build your character's skill and power trees. Then the game switches over to Combat Rating, which is almost completely based on the gear you find/buy in game. If you're a free player, you're incredibly limited to what stories you can play. You can still manage to level up, but you'll need to do the same missions over and over. Subscribing will open up everything. I've played from Level 1 to CR 100 without having to repeat a mission more than once or twice.			"

												I would love to recommend this game. It is honestly a great game, and if you have 15$ a month to spend on a subscription this game is AMAZING. Problem is if you don't... well lets just say the restrictions will be far to much to bear after only a few days of playing.First is the issue with the game caping off usable cash for free players at 1500, 2000 if you have spents 5 or more rl dollars in their cash shop. Without ""legendary access"" it will cost you 100 DB points (1$ U.S.D.) to access 1000 ingame cash from your escrow and that is a 1 and only use item, so they basically make you pay to access the money your character has earned in game. You can pay them 500 DB points to gain access to your own earned cash ingame for 7 days. That is right, THEY MAKE YOU PAY TO USE YOUR OWN IN GAME CURRENCY.Secondly as a free player you will mearly be able to preview what housing does. The lairs system is locked again behind a pay wall. You can see it's features, but you cannot utilise them without either a 5$ rl cash investment per character to unlock the ""Lairs systems"" blocking you access to some of the best gear modifiactions in the game, as well as stopping you from obtaining some specific items that make the game that much more fun such as side kicks, resupply drops (HP POTS ETC), an higher tier modifications. Also this home includes a generator that has the ability to buff your stats a fair amount but is not usable unless you pay.Endgame is basically nonexsistant for free players, there are things to do, but a ""legendary"" member will be able to play any and all ""Alerts"" (raids), ""Flashpoints"" (Dungeons/Instances), where a free player will be restricted to Tier 3 and lower do to the fact that they will not be granted access to the expanded content or ""DLC"" content unless they pay 5 dollars per DLC from Daybreak. Meaning a ""Legendary"" member has a possible CR (gear score) of 180+ (T8) where a free player wil never reach a CR higher than 84, and that will take 5-6x longer to reach than a person that spends 15$ a month.It isn't a bad game, it is just a greedy one. If you wanna play free, bring a friend and kill a weekend because in a week you will reach a wall that can only be climb with your wallet. It is fun, unique an well executed. JUST GREEDY AS HELL, so if you are planning on f2ping your way to the top like others game such as Neverwinter. Don't bother even trying this one out.Final Verddict,FULL SCALE PAY TO PLAY - F2P is more like a big demoThere are three levels of Pay to Play in DC Universe™ Online.All Access - The Greed is showingLegendary Access to DCUO now is possible through the new Daybreak Games All Access Membership which was introduced in April 2014. All Access means pay monthly to have full featured access to all Daybreak games. Without this most of DC Universe will be hard locked behind a pay wall. You will receive basic content and is hardly noticeable until end game, where it becomes glaringly obvious that this game should have come with a demo tag on download.Legendary - Pay to Play or you get basically nothingLegendary Access requires the purchase of a monthly All Access Membership, without this just about 2/3rds of content is ""PAY LOCKED"". Legendary Access will automatically convert to Premium Access in the game at the end of the subscription period if it is not renewed. This change will hard cap the amount of ingame funds you can access, additional items and features (e.g., in-game marketplace items, all gear above CR 84 becomes in accessible, expanded content and additional inventory slots) are not included and must be purchased separately. So in other words NEVER LET your subscription lapse or your hard work will vanish in a matter of seconds.Premium - The half ♥♥♥♥♥ way of thanking you for spending moneyPremium Access will be granted to any player who spends at least U.S. $5.00 (or the foreign equivalent) or 500 Daybreak Cash on items in the DCUO in-game marketplace. Premium Access does not expire, but is almost as restrictive as Free access. If you previously had Legendary Access and allowed your subscription to end you also may be forced to disable or delete up to 10 of your characters.Free Access - Basically a DemoProvides basic access to the game with limited content and features. This is basically a demo of what the game has to offer, it you never subscribed to Legendary Access you wont really notice this fact until you reach level cap. Episodes Packs and Power Packs plus other items and features are not included and must be purchased separately so unless you are willing to pay into this game, don't even bother.EDIT: Their community manager is a putz, and will ban you instantaniously for saying anything remotely negative about the way he and daybreak are handeling their duties.

												This is one of the most fun games I've ever played in my entire life.  Famous DC heroes (and villains!) don't just send you on fetch missions, they also fight alongside you in raids, which is one of the coolest feelings in the world, and the voice acting is ultra-good.  Dressing up your own hero is a lot of fun too, you can recreate any existing hero or make your own by collecting outfit pieces, and the selection is huge.  There's also a lot of super powers to choose from.  The cities feel fairly big, and they're fairly populated, and very lively.  The way you can mix your powers with your weapon skills during combat is entertaining, and I really like how a lot of silver-age heroes are present in the game, it ads a very welcome touch of class to the environment.  There's even housing in the form of your ""base of operations"", and various stuff drops in the game so you can place it around your base. I give it FOUR thumbs up! (two with my hands, and two with my toes) "

												Yet another Free to Play, Pay to Win game. I hate it when games do this, but I still stick with DCUO anyways. Maybe it is my obsession with DC that keeps bringing me back, however it isn't strong enough for me to pay 120 dollars a year to have a full subsription. My suggestion for DC would be to drop the optional subcription and just charge for really super powered weapons and armor that people can choose to buy if they really want to. Thtat would make DCUO the best action RPGMMO in my opinion. The fighting is a blast, the character creation is amazingly in depth AND you can even play the game on a Playstation if you prefer console over PC. It truly is an amazing game, a blast to play and full of tons of fun missions against recognizable badies throughout the DC Universe (or good guys if you chose to be evil). I would absolutely suggest giving this game a try, but don't pay money for extra stuff. We need to let DC know that we don't like the way they try and take our money through extras that should be available to anyone using money you earn in-game.			"

												Seriously a contender for best MMO I've ever played, and I've played almost every one of them. The combat system is really intense. Universal block and dodge, click combo-system much like Vindictus or Tera. The quality of the game is overall amazing. PvE and PvP are both intense. Not pay-to-win in any way whatsoever. Full controller support. If you are tired of the extremely over-used fantasy setting and plot, have ever liked any kind of super-hero, or have ever wanted to fly around through a city with friends, this is the game to play.

												City of Heroes is dead (*sniff*).  I like Champions Online, but it's a bit too cartoony (yes, I said that about a superhero game).  So...DC Online.  I bought it back when it first came out, and ran with a couple of villain and hero groups.  Then put it away because, yeah, content is limited.  And it still is.  But for free, you can zip around Gotham and Metropolis for a month or so, level up a few chars, then quit when it gets grindy.   A year and a half break and I'm back to enjoying it for its action combat and graphics.  Dunno if I'm going to get serious about it again, but definitely worth taking a look.			"

												Fun game, but it relies way too much on the holy trinity. Since I mained Healer, this affected me way too much for me to enjoy the game. Before you start raiding, it's fine, you can do any solo or group content without too much hassle. You can get away with no tank or no controller (restores group's energy). But once you hit 30 and start raiding, this issue becomes unignorable. If your controller can't, or won't (looking at you, PUG raid controllers), restore energy, your group will wipe unless you're being carried. If your tank misses agro on 1 mob, your healer will die.The healer relies too much on the controller, who both equally rely on the tank, who relies on DPS to kill ♥♥♥♥. It sounds basic, but it's like 10x the reliance on party composition in PvE content than any other game I've ever played. As a healer, I can only cast 3 single-target heals before I'm completely drained of energy. This game has no passive energy regeneration, so I have to attack to regain energy. But attacking gives me less than 1% of my energy. Imagine the pressure and aggravation of having to heal someone, let alone a group, when your heals take 30% of your energy and your attacks restore 0.2%. That's the hell I live every time I try to do 8-man content or world bosses in this game.			"

												this was a great game. there are lots of players and the co-op is great. however for some reason when I talk to NPCs I lose connection alot this started happening when I got to the boss fight with brouther blood. one of my favorite things is legends pvp. but for beginers legends pvp as a hero can be frustraiting and the villains starter is much beter than robin. The DLCs are awesome too. well the ones I can figure out how to use anyway. sadly this game once you get into it is not really free to play. yes you can keep playing when you reach level 30 but you can't level up with out paying more. also the character slots are disipoiting too. you can only make two chartacters with out paying $5.00 for one more or buying the legendary membership wich for a year is $120.00 a year. There are many good things about the game but for the sakeof time and length of the review am only saying the best and worst things and what a buyer should know before purchusing			"

												This is quite possibly the worst game I've ever had the misfortune to waste my time on. Just downloading and installing the game took literally 12 hours. The character creation customization is impressive, although, the majority of the powers are already behind a paywall. The inventory you begin with is quite small. In fact, it appears to be smaller then it was previously since I watched a free-to-play review of this game and in that video the guy commented on his large inventory, which was visibly twice the size of the one I had.The opening dungeon features a custscene with superman. Ok, he sounds vaguely like superman, looks like superman but apparently he lost the power to lip sync because while his lips move occassionally, their movement and what he is saying don't relate AT ALL. Considering that is the first cut scene you ever see, you think they could at least get that right, but NOPE. Bruce Lee movies from the 1970's had better dubbing. I'm not even kidding.Visually, the game otherwise looks good. That is, however, where anything positive I have to say about this game ends.The combat system however, is *INCREDIBLY* clunky, at least with a mouse. The UI cannot be customized *AT ALL*, the controls cant be customised *AT ALL*. The in game help leaves MUCH to be desired. Thats just dps. For healing, this game has to the most horrible implementation *ever*. You cannot actually target someone, the game simply heals whatever it thinks the priority target is. So, if you can see someone is about to take damage, well, that doesn't matter someone on low health but taking zero incoming damage will be prioritized regardless of what you think. Yup, ingenius.The efficient heals have a rather LONG and IMPOSSIBLE TO MISS animation and are interruptible. As a PVP-oriented player I immediately recognized that casting one of these heals would immediately lead to the entire world spamming the lvl 1 zero cool down hard stun on you for having the temerity to consider joining a game as a healer.This would be bad enough, but at least I could perhaps enjoy a few instances of pve first? LOL NOPE! The people I had the misfortune to group with used the games abilities that allow you to fly, walk over walls etc. to take themselves to every level, corner and as far away as humanly possible from each other in both terms of distance and elevation, aggro everything and mindlessly drag this uncontrolled mass around with them as they ran like chickens with their heads chopped off from the ravening hordes of mobs. Fortunately, if you cast a heal then the instance population would then b-line for you and end your misery in short order, before returning to annilating your moronic companions. character creation: excellent 4.5/5Animation: decent 4/5voice: cannot lip sync, otherwise ok, 3/5dps mechanics: awful 1/5healing mechanics: hideous 0/5in game help: awful 1/5quests: stale boring 2/5			"

												DC Universe online is very fun to play, and I could live my dream of becoming a Superhero and fighting alongside Batman, Superman, Wonderwoman, and so many more. It might have been my favorite MMORPG if it weren't for one VERY fatal flaw.While DC Universe is a good time of the surface, you will quickly find that you are incredibly limited in what you can do with a free account, which is to be expected with a Free to Play game right? Sure. Except that with a free account, DC Universe Online limits the amount of currency your PC can carry. Your money is capped at $1,500, and the rest you earn is sent to your ""bank"" which is locked unless you pay a ""withdrawl fee"" or pay for the game. This bars you from obtaining high quality gear, practically forcing you to pay. Maybe I would pay for the full version if the whole game didn't feel like a desperate ploy by DC to make some cash. If you are somehow not put off by these limitations, then by all means, play it. But honestly, this is borderline robbery.Now then, I'm off to play Star Trek Online.			"

												It's a little embarassing how many hours my family has put in over the years on this game. There's no other game we play more. There's no other game we come back to more often. There's no other game we would even consider paying $120 a year to keep coming up with new stuff for us to loot, grind, quest for, or achieve. Be a hero. There's a whole community of heroes in here to help you, play with you, teach you.Be a villain. If you thought the hero side had a community, you ain't seen nothin' yet. The villain side community tends to have more mature, experienced conscientious gamers. Really great folks. Haters gonna hate. So utilize your ignore feature and you will never be grouped with them again, hear them speak, or ever have to deal with their immaturity again. I wish every online game had a feature as useful and encompassing as this one. It helps us weed out those undesireables so we don't waste any time on them.Costumes: We spend hours sometimes just redressing our toons. We spend hours sometimes grinding for styles. Worried that once you find that ellusive style you will get buyers remorse? don't sweat it. there's a huge online community wiki page that will show you what just about every style piece looks like.Bad Stuff: Honestly, there's so much good to outweigh the bad, but here goes - grinding can be boring (but mmos are always about grinding and I actually find a little grinding after work relaxing ... NO not that kind of grinding, but now that you mention it ...) - power balance in constant flux. Invest in a certain character type only to find it just got nerfed/oped to the point of not being fun anymore? Well, honestly, just play any of you other toons until the next update and watch the dev team fix there mistakes. They really do their best to try and keep things balanced pretty well, but they DO make mistakes.- Too fun. I lose time from playing the other games in my library that I love to play because of this wonderful gem of a game. "

												This game is absolutely amazing. After their Update 31, everything changed completely, but everyone adapted and changed along with it!!! From level 1 to level 30 its a steady and easy process. It can be done in a day, few hours in the least too. Then with Combat Ratings, even that is carefully planned out by people with mods and more cooler looking and better equipment! I have yet to reach the highest CR, but guaranteed, this game has been nothing but fun and entertainment to me.			"

												Uhm not sure what to write here so just gonna paste a pancake recipe:Ingredients:100g plain flour2 egg300ml semi-skimmed milk1 tbsp sunflower oilor vegetable, plus extra for fryingpinch saltMethod:Blending in the flour: Put the flour and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the centre. Crack the eggs into the middle, then pour in about 50ml milk and 1 tbsp oil. Start whisking from the centre, gradually drawing the flour into the eggs, milk and oil. Once all the flour is incorporated, beat until you have a smooth, thick paste. Add a little more milk if it is too stiff to beat.Finishing the batter: Add a good splash of milk and whisk to loosen the thick batter. While still whisking, pour in a steady stream of the remaining milk. Continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter that is the consistency of slightly thick single cream. Traditionally, people would say to now leave the batter for 30 mins, to allow the starch in the flour to swell, but there’s no need.Getting the right thickness: Heat the pan over a moderate heat, then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper. Ladle some batter into the pan, tilting the pan to move the mixture around for a thin and even layer. Quickly pour any excess batter into a jug, return the pan to the heat, then leave to cook, undisturbed, for about 30 secs. Pour the excess batter from the jug back into the mixing bowl. If the pan is the right temperature, the pancake should turn golden underneath after about 30 secs and will be ready to turn.Flipping pancakes: Hold the pan handle, ease a fish slice under the pancake, then quickly lift and flip it over. Make sure the pancake is lying flat against base of the pan with no folds, then cook for another 30 secs before turning out onto a warm plate. Continue with the rest of the batter, serving them as you cook or stack onto a plate. You can freeze the pancakes for 1 month, wrapped in cling film or make them up to a day ahead.			"

												The F2P side does have a lot to offer, though most people don't realize it or lose interest in the grind. The level cap is at 30 yes, but once there, it doesn't really matter. Your combat rating, determined by your gear, is what counts and gives you access to higher tier instances/raids. DLCs vital to gameplay and further advancement would have to be Battle for Earth, Lightning Strikes, and Fight for the Light, in that order. Earth gives you access to higher tier armour after reaching a 45-48 CR as well as a raid... if I recall correctly. Lightning Strikes gives you duos and access to central city, and Light gives you several alerts... though with all the DLCs out now and all future releases, it's hard to keep up with paying for it all, back then I'd say buy the DLCs, seeing as you get to keep them all even without a paid subscription, but becoming a ""Legendary"" (paid sub) member, is probably the better choice, seeing as your cash flow isn't restricted, nor is your inventory and bank storage space. All that technical stuff aside, DC is great for those who want to jump in on the DC Universe, or are long time fans. Controls really are innovative and I have yet to find another MMO playstyle like it. The combat isn't just a point and click and each class/playstyle is reliant on the other when it comes to PVP. Though it does take some time to get used to the pay off is usually worth the grind, with all the flashy and powerful gear, it'll sate all of your comicbook/gamer needs all in one fell swoop.			"

You get to completely customize your hero or villian and than you're immersed into a very very developed world and storyline at absolutely no cost to you. You can play with friends on a team and complete missions to earn some pretty nice loot..all for nothing. Oh hey did I mention it was free?			"

												really fun game if you put the time and effort into it. Unfortunately however, it turns into a chore once you get to endgame, so much in fact, that you must grind for hours to get the best pvp and pve gear. The game is also technically a P2W game, especially since you can't ascess your escrow money unless you've spent 5 or more dollars on the game. It may have changed since I last played it back in 2013, but I wouldn't put your hopes up. Overall a good game if there is nothing else to play.			"

												The only way to really review DCUO is to compare it to its competitors. A few years back, that would have included the seemingly amazing City of Heroes that predated it, and Champions Online. Now, only Champions Online exists as a contender against it.DCUO has one major problem compared to its competitor, I believe. The setting conspires against the plot. The problem we have is that DCUO is set in a reality where tons of people are getting superpowers and becoming sidekicks to famous heroes. Which... Is kind of not what anybody wants in a superhero mmo. Sure, it explains just about EVERYTHING, but it means your characters aren't the main character. You can try to do your own thing, strike out on your own, but ultimately, you're the pre-Nightwing Robin to some canon character's Batman. Heck, it can actually BE Batman!That said, it's a very pretty game, the combat mechanics are very nice (it's also available on PS3), and I have to admit that, while the costume creator isn't as good as Champions Online in terms of content, it is very polished.That said, I'd personally stick with Champions Online, as my laptop cannot run DCUO easily, but I'd recommend DCUO to people who haven't tried Champions yet, or at least try both, and make up your own mind. :)			"

												For a free-to-play game, DCUO gives you a great amount of content and hours of gamepay without paying a cent. However, if you want to play beyond th early stages of level 30 and do the higher tier raids, you have to buy a DLC or two, but it is not mandatory to enjoy the game.As long as I have been playing it, the developers and producers have been consistently updating and adding new features.DCUO is a must try game. I mean come on, the game is free.That being said, the graphics amd UI have not been updated in quite some time. If this was fixed in conjunction with a few mechanics impreovements, the game would shine again.			"

												Where do I begin? I was playing the non-steam version of this game ever since it came out, and you know what?It's  my favourite game of all time.Everything about this game is perfectly excecuted. The combat is nothing like in any other game I have ever played, every move is fluent, heck, I'd even say majestic. The maps (being Gotham and Metropolis) are stunning, Gotham feels like Gotham, Motropolis feels like Metropolis, and there's enough detail to keep you entertained for hours on end. But let's talk about the best thing in the game:CustomisationUnlike games such as TOR, this game gives you the freedom its users deserve to create their own unique hero or villain, you can choose your powers, costumes, hair, you can even become a leopard!This game, to me, is the ultimate superhero simulator, with this much variety, you can never be bored.A true triumph of an MMO, and another reason DC are the king of comics.

												Graphically, mechanically and engrossingly fine. nice plot with only the usual holes a psuedo intellectual would poke at for 2 reasons 1. it makes them feel better about themselves and 2. its the only thing they will be poking for a while.The game itself is pretty darn good, a lot of customisation. you get loot drops which can be costume pieces(which, when you get one you get the option to change any future pieces into one of that style) or random stuffs which does stuffs...there are stats, the loot can boost your stats which means epic lewtz...there is an ""end game"" raids...but its a little too early for me to know anything about that...in short...its a little bit more expensive than other mmo's...and it really isnt 40kDMO...however...it just might be worth it, the combat system is pretty good too, combos though...urgh...make my head hurt counting the stuffs. if you liked dmc, you will probably think this is missing something, but if you like mmos AND dmc...this is for you :)			"

												Uhm not sure what to write here so just gonna paste a pancake recipe:Ingredients:100g plain flour2 egg300ml semi-skimmed milk1 tbsp sunflower oilor vegetable, plus extra for fryingpinch saltMethod:Blending in the flour: Put the flour and a pinch of salt into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the centre. Crack the eggs into the middle, then pour in about 50ml milk and 1 tbsp oil. Start whisking from the centre, gradually drawing the flour into the eggs, milk and oil. Once all the flour is incorporated, beat until you have a smooth, thick paste. Add a little more milk if it is too stiff to beat.Finishing the batter: Add a good splash of milk and whisk to loosen the thick batter. While still whisking, pour in a steady stream of the remaining milk. Continue pouring and whisking until you have a batter that is the consistency of slightly thick single cream. Traditionally, people would say to now leave the batter for 30 mins, to allow the starch in the flour to swell, but there’s no need.Getting the right thickness: Heat the pan over a moderate heat, then wipe it with oiled kitchen paper. Ladle some batter into the pan, tilting the pan to move the mixture around for a thin and even layer. Quickly pour any excess batter into a jug, return the pan to the heat, then leave to cook, undisturbed, for about 30 secs. Pour the excess batter from the jug back into the mixing bowl. If the pan is the right temperature, the pancake should turn golden underneath after about 30 secs and will be ready to turn.Flipping pancakes: Hold the pan handle, ease a fish slice under the pancake, then quickly lift and flip it over. Make sure the pancake is lying flat against base of the pan with no folds, then cook for another 30 secs before turning out onto a warm plate. Continue with the rest of the batter, serving them as you cook or stack onto a plate. You can freeze the pancakes for 1 month, wrapped in cling film or make them up to a day ahead.			"

												Great game and a huge amount of fun with friends!I have played this game alot however only recently i decided to run it through SteamIt can be a bit P2W sometimes whereas you can pay for some new powers to use however they are all balenced regardless.The customisation is amazing however the only downside being there is no sliders to do any minor tweaks.Aside from some issues that my friend had after his account getting erased causing him to lose everything during the server merge it is an awesome game to play if you want an mmorpg that's more action based with a nice mixture between hand to hand combat and using your powers.I'd reccomend this as a game to play if you either have never touched an mmo before in your life and want to give one a shot (Great starting point into the mmo genre), or an mmo veteran, its a little bit grindy to unlock all your power tree and once you hit the level cap (30) you can do some sweet raids or pvp events for awesome looking gear to further increase your stats beyond the 30 cap.8/10 fun to play but a bit grindy and p2w at times.

												I definitely recommend this game. It's one of the best I have ever played. The thing is, a lot of people like to say it's bad because of the way its marketing is handled, but the way they do things is justified....to a certain extent. The DLC they release has licensed stories that go along with them, along with armors, feats, base items, etc... So, of course, I think it's just to have a limit for Free Players' levels. However, I do think the game is in dire need of some changes. First off, my legs get broken every time I attack or get attacked. What's up with that? I can go to Crysis, and fight aliens with fast-paced combat, while keeping real-time momentum, and being able to keep my speed. Why the *foop* do you want to slow us down? I picked Superspeed as my first power, and as soon as I got to the Hive mission around level 9, I got sick of it. *Acquires Super-speed**Does NOT use it in combat*Then, I got the Last Laugh DLC, went into the Safehouses (as a hero) and Night Clubs (as a villain), and saw Superman and other flight-enabled iconics flying so fast in combat? Why weigh us down, Daybreak? Why? I think there's no need for this at all.Anther thing I want to do is make a request, if you're reading this. I think it would be a good idea to make advanced mechanics for iconic powers and movement powers. See, some people play this game to be as close to their favorite super heroes and villains as they like. They even go around with names inspired by those people. As of now, people who use iconics at level CR 43+ are ridiculed, since this game is heavily reliant on teamwork, which isn't a bad thing, so, I think you should actually allow people who want to use these to be relevant in damage output, rather than having them stick with a loadout that everyone else uses, thereby making them have less of a fun time.TL;DR: This is an awesome game. Their DLC practices are justified, especially compared to games that sell you DLC that's already on the discs.Please don't slow us down in battle, and please make advanced mechanics for Speed, Flight (as well as its re-skin, Skimming), Acrobatics and Iconic Powers. Make people who use iconic powers to actually be ""stronger than a locomotive.""Anyway, thank you for this awesome game. As I said, I cannot love it enough, and would defend its DLC practices forever, but I do have my problems with it, 'cause no game is perfect. Thanks again, Daybreak.			"

												8/10: only mmo I had more fun playing alone. N-not that I wanted to play with anyone or anything...Pros:      +Strong story and familiar characters     +Fun and detailed character creation     +Mission design and voice acting makes it feel like there's no grind at allCons:     -Bad ui designed for consoles     -Crippleware (Pay2Win's ugly hillbilly cousin)     -SoE (as if Station Cash weren't bad enough, they're also deader than this game)     -Buggy dungeonsFirst logging on I loved this game from the start. Unfortunately, the quality of the intro is no indicator of the game's overall animation. Motionless lips, flickering stillframes, jerky motion, and stale in-game cutscenes are just too cheesy. it's fortunate that the voice acting, overall writing, and sparse storyboards distract from this. Just what I love the most about this game (besides the hilarious marvel knockoffs made by the few remaining players) is how involved I felt in LEx Luthor and the Joker's campaigns. Few games give me a stroonger sense of evil in my character's actions than this. The very first mission Lex gives you is to bust up into a college campus and murder every cop/student you see except for the few you spare to turn into monsters. Lotsa fridge horror. The sense of involvement my character had in the setting was like maining an Undead in WoW right after Cata dropped and leveling through Silverpine Forest. You were in the middle of a war that you would become invested in and the major hitters of the game addressed you not as a faceless grunt or great general, but as a combatant just as involved as they were. In DCU, hero or villain, you will walk through Gotham and Metropolis and see craziness the result of every other person getting super powers and going ape with it. It really reminds me of DC's Kingdome Come[en.wikipedia.org].All praise aside, Sony's attempt to incentivize players to pay is agonizing. I can't speak for subscribers, but I understand SoE had as much love for them as they did the F2P players who cannot even hold more than 1500 dollars (which is not enough to by anything at later levels). This game doesn't just suffer from a shriveling community, which is a death sentance for almost any mmo, but also from practices that drive away F2P players due to limiting their ability to play. Really, it would be more accurate to call it a demo.Anyway, should you play DC Universe? Well if you don't mind shoveling through F2P ♥♥♥♥ like I do then there's no downside if you're waiting for the next title to hit the shop and you got the time to spare downloading it. It has a lot of DC comic fluff and reminds me of the first mass effect's combat mixed with a fighter in a way. If you have better games to play in your library and you don't have the patience to deal with bugs and downloads, or just plain get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the idea of pay to win do not waste your time with this game.[/u]

												Very entertaining game, playerbase does fall a bit short now with almost nobody on the open-world PvP, you will certainly find entertainment in it as a free player, BUT late-game really does kind of need you to pay to get the full extent of items, (inventory slots, powers, weapons and certain quests and features).Pros:-Very fun, especially if you are already into the theme of this game-Combat mechanic is a mix of what feels like free attack mode and tab targetting, you can do both-Very fun boss fights-Encouraged to play with other players, all quests can be done with your friendsCons:-End-game falls short with free to play players-Not enough movement options as I would likeI recommend playing on the PvP server, but you can switch between PvP and PvE world at any time.

Your hero or villian will be at its lowest level as you start off. Even though you are at your lowest level you can increase your level by completing the set missions on your campaign. Your max level is 30 and once you've reached level 30 you are able to to roam around many places, gaining stronger armor and boosting your ability to fight other players with different levels of armor.

Mas as coisas que realmente importam num MMO como economia e crafting são quase inexistentes. Um MMO que se encaixa bem na definição de ""mmo casual""Jogue, é muito legal, mas saiba que não irá jogar seriamente como outros MMO'sO jogo não chega a ser P2W mas tem um sistema de dlc, de forma que qm compra a dlc ou paga o vip tem muito mais conteúdo que o jogador freezão.Alem de ser um prato cheio pra quem gosta no universo DC, o jogo tenta mostrar as vertentes mais importantes, juntas em uma unica historia.

												First of all, I recommend a fast internet connection...not necessarily in order to play, but for the download. After downloading a few gigs on the initial download from Steam, it patched another 11 GB. So... if you do have a slow connection, this one will be one of those ""overnight downloads""Anyway, what can I say about DCUO? I did start playing about 4 weeks after it was launched, and liked it very much early on. I eventually did stop playing, but came back several times. Unfortunately, due to the switch to and from P7S1-Games and an email-addy I cant access anymore, I lost my original account and another one I made. It's not THAT much of a problem though, as leveling a char to the cap level does not take long at all. You do a few ""main story"" quests plus some bonus side quests, and in no time, you are there. So, leveling is not as much a part of the game as in other MMOs, unless you wanna level a ton of alts. That is totally ok though, I like leveling, but don't need days of leveling in EVERY game I play. The game itself is lots of fun, and since I mentioned alts: YOu should try a few, try different builds. The weapon sets (like gadgets, swords, guns, kinetics etc.) are tons of FUN. So is the controller-role IMO... most of the chars I made were controllers. If you like to, you can build a new char based on your favorite DC char (I made a Batman-inspired gadget-using controller, and on my old account, I made a Flash- and a Green-Lantern inspired char. The latter was pretty easy regarding outfit and powers, as one of the DLCs will give you very nice Lantern-style powers). Or you can go for a totally unique character regarding powers and outfitsThe game is fast, think ""MMO meets arcade beat em up"". The races and challenges are fun, and one thing I liked was that several of the quest bosses and special dungeons you do at cap level especially (and I am talking about solo-instances) are pretty challenging the first few times. It DID feel like a nice little achievement to finally beat some of these encounters, so that was nice.The game never kept me playing longer than a few weeks, but also, I always keep coming back to it. It's fast, it can be quite tough, but it's tons of fun, whether you are a DC fan or not.			"

If you like to, you can build a new char based on your favorite DC char (I made a Batman-inspired gadget-using controller, and on my old account, I made a Flash- and a Green-Lantern inspired char. The latter was pretty easy regarding outfit and powers, as one of the DLCs will give you very nice Lantern-style powers). Or you can go for a totally unique character regarding powers and outfitsThe game is fast, think ""MMO meets arcade beat em up"". The races and challenges are fun, and one thing I liked was that several of the quest bosses and special dungeons you do at cap level especially (and I am talking about solo-instances) are pretty challenging the first few times. It DID feel like a nice little achievement to finally beat some of these encounters, so that was nice.The game never kept me playing longer than a few weeks, but also, I always keep coming back to it. It's fast, it can be quite tough, but it's tons of fun, whether you are a DC fan or not.			"

												The community is very nice. No matter how many characters you make, no matter how many combos of powers, and costume peices, you will always have something new. Even if you've played the main story twenty times, you'll still love it. Though it has a few things are are set backs, like crashes and bugs, but nothing's perfect. Over all, out of all the free-to-play mmos, it's one of the best, if not the best. Nothing feels more rewarding then taking down a villain alongside your favorite superhero, or ruling the world with your favorite villain. If you try this game, I assure you, a lot of fun playing time will insue.			"

												Since Daybreak took over I can no longer log in to the game to even play. I've noticed similar issues spanning back a couple years now. Try to log in or register an account and verify account via email then you are meant with, "" Must change your password only for it to fail by doing the same thing. The only fix is to contact support by logging a ticket which I can't seem to do without logging so next bet is call them directly.  Up to you if you want to call them but the game was moderately enjoyable at times and I don't want to play it that bad that I have to wait on a call. Truth be told I don't want to give Daybreak my business.... so screw it I will play everything else instead.			"

												A lot of people complain about the game being pay to win. It really isn't, you can't buy op gear or anything the most you can get is new powers which come from expansions. No different than WoW and its trial version. You can get to the end game with the vanilla version but if you want to expand on the world with new areas and new powers or weapon types you buy an expansion. I recommend if you understand how most MMOs work, and realize they are ever growing with expansions regularly added.			"

												Well I'm not an OG of this game, but I can say for this being my first MMO and what got me into MMOs this is a GREAT starter game and continuos casual game for a ton of enjoyment. There aren't as many players as there were but that's irrelevent because this game's potential is there, the devs are fair, and the gameplay isn't lacking. Now, with that said I will begin to explain why I decided to say PLAY this game:PROS:1.) I've played alot of MMOs and this is by far the one you'll want if you like the idea of FULL control of your created character, power team runs (just like living the comics whih is a HUGE plus), and crazy fun...and I mean crazy hehe.2.) Tons of gameplay even after you've finished the tutorial (the real game begins with DLC...and the DLC is very pleasing and vast).3.) The only MMO I've played in which the combat system isn't stale and easily coexists with your characters abilities.4.) Great Community, though with the exception of some (like in every other MMO) ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who like to complain when the simplest solution is DO WHAT YOU FEEL YOU SHOULD when it comes to getting more out of this game or staying on the retrospect and doing nothing as others enjoy the fruits of what this game has to offer.5.) Very social Developers-nuff saidCONS:1.) If you're expecting this to have vehicles like its comics well you might be dissapointed (but I assure you there is a reason and a day will come when that reason is resolved).2.) This game lacks SOME things creatively in the point of ordinary things, but I've learned that compared to other games this game still gives it as much as it gets, so its fine.3.) Lag is forever present, but don't worry the community as I've said will understand-just giving a heads up in advance. Its not a lag thats deathly but its annoying and appears usually after DLC or updates, but lasts rather short.4.) OG players ranting the game is dead. I assure you it not-people have jobs, go to school, and do other things. We can't play this ALL DAY all the time, so that being said IGNORE those who say this game is dead or dying-its just fine.5.) Villains and Heroes cannot associate other than PVP combat or combat in general; however, this might change in the future (perhaps very soon actually).6.) Free to Play to a point, but if you want more you'll have to put down a few buck-and I do mean a few (its not as bad as you think, its actually quite affordable). 7.) Ridiculous prices made by in-game players in the broker; however, there are ust as many kind souls offering cheaper for things that cost a lot.8.) Free to Play currency and Premium currency are capped at a low max 1500 to 2k in-game which forces you to either pay subsciption fee or buy daily opening for unlimited revenue. I suggest you just put down a monthly subscription and easly have access to all the funds you'll need.*Well this is my review and I hope it helps-its not perfect but its what I've come to experience from this game. Its worth every penny with friends or solo! This game has more to be shown so expect great things from this and I promise you wn't regret your choice-Play On!			"

												Pros: You can be a super hero or super villain with your friends and save the world again and again on epic adventures.  Good music and lots to explore make this an interesting and full world.Cons: Being that it is a free to-play-game, the money that the creators get comes from you purchasing the DLC.  So to a large extent it is a pay-to-win game.All in all I'd say it is worth playing, but keep in mind that in this game the playing is greatly enhanced by the paying.			"

												Pretty good game, but your experience will depend on how you mainly interact with the quests and the community. The speak is everywhere and pretty lonely and hard to ignore, but sometimes can be a good laugh.Sometimes people play spot the newbie and like to help out, sometimes people can be nasty but garunteed if they do it over shout, someone will put them in their place. Theres a huge feeling of community within the game.Also learn to use the /ignore feature. it helps well in the PD's with the ever spawning ""Gold vendors"" and ""SC vendors"" telling you to go to their site.

You can choose to be a Hero or a Villian, customize your Hero/Villian, pick a mentor, power, weapon, name, etc.  It's not really Pay to Win, but there is a marketplace, and Free Players' Cash limit is $1,500 at most, and the rest goes to ""Escrow"", which, in my knowledge, is only accessible by Members.

Civilians across the globe gain supernatural powers through these nanomachines and use those to fight off Brainiac's invasion and helping legendary superheroes such as Superman and Wonder Woman. The game is overall superior to Champions Online, but it lacks the in-depth character customization that CO has (in terms of variety) and just as CO it doesn't give you a satisfactory superhero experience.

												A really good RPG,if you like HQs,like MARVEL or DC Comics,and love RPGs,this is the perfect game for youI have played A LOT,cuz the criativity of creation your character is awesome,have a lot of things and characters than you can make,for example,make Deadpool,Sans or Deathstroke EXACTLY equal the originalHave a lot of guys making negative recommendations for this game,cuz all things is DLC,butWithout DLC the game is a lot of fun.

												This is fairly well made Online game, considering that it's in DC universe. The game's main story is pretty good and flows well, along with the world around it. However, it get pretty boring after a while, especially if you don't have friends who play actively with you. I recommend just continue playing free and not subbing, despite silly cash cap being 1500 without sub.			"

												Definantly the best superhero MMO on the market right now, but it does have its drawbacks.Pros- Lengthy Customization  - Wide assortment of ablities/weapons to choose from- Transporatation mecahnics are funCons- Sound effects are cheap - A good amount of abilities and powers are locked until you buy them with reall money- Below average graphics- Older superhero costumes (opinion)TL:DRDCUO is fun, but it's only fun if you really like DC comics. It has a long customization and a really fun transportation mecahnic, but other than that is not that great			"

												Decent MMO but it's really difficult to progress beyond tier 3 without buying anything.Here is an updated in-depth guide I have added for more details, broke up into sections:GameplayThe gameplay is really good in my opinion. Each weapon and power has both ranged and melee options, and each of the movements are easy to use. The community / playerbaseTerrible. One of the worst I've ever seen.Graphics & OptimizationThe game doesn't have really nice graphics but they don't look totally horrible either. The graphics options are decent but lack a lot of options most other games have. The game runs with a good FPS but if you uncap it from 30 (by turning v-sync off) then you get frame stuttering sometimes.Controls and UIAs this game was made for the PS3 and the PC, the UI and controls are mostly made like a console game is, but it isn't bad at all. The UI is quite big in most menus and sometimes clunky, but is easily usable. You can change the size of the HUD, change the font size in the chat box and change the alpha of the HUD. The controls with a keyboard and mouse (what I've always used) is good. It is fine to play the game with, if not, better to use than a controller which it was designed for.Pay to win / microtransactionsThe game is free to play, but has a lot of features hidden behind either a membership or something you need to buy. Some of these you don't need and others are just annoying if you don't have. Some of the things you can only do by buying something is using any of the new powers, the shield weapon (isn't better than any other weapon anyway), extra character slots, inventory slots, and max currency. The further you get into the game, the more you're pressured into buying a membership / upgrade. Yes, you can play it completely free, but only until around tier 4 (the highest is tier 8 right now I think) and any higher than tier 4 requires you to buy the episodes or a membership.I have made a guide for this game, if you wish to read it.

												I LOVE this game on my Ps3 and I wish I could port my charecters over to the PC and keep my DLC stuff I had bought. (If this is possible please reach out to me)-The Combat is fluent and easy to learn.-The Missions are fun, but can get repititve if done alone.-The PvP is fun and Unique.-Money for free-to-play and preimum are WAY TO LOW!!!-Hours of fun if you have friends to play with.-Lots of armors and player customization.-Login que is very long for anything below a Legendry membership.This game gets a 8/10 because of the restrictions and the fact you can't swap characters back and forth between gaming platforms. As well as the money and space restrictions. "

												Pros:- A superhero game- Good UI- Great combat system- Good game mechanics- Alt-friendly- Decent character customization- Good story arcs- Controller supportCons:- This game has so many paywalls- Plenty of people in the community suck- Endless cycle of devs nerfing and buffing powers so players would keep buying power respec tokens to switch powers- Devs cater to casual players and constantly implements unnecessary changes that ruins the game (GU36)- Devs constantly nerf content that doesn't even need to be nerfed- Repetitive- Grindy - Depending on your Combat Rating (level), you're limited on the old content that you can receive marks from- PvP is broken and dead. If you're the type of person who mostly PvPs in MMOs, you should avoid this game- There are always bugs and glitches whenever game updates and episodes are released			"

												I found out that when you buy the Episode dlcs you do not unlock the abilitie/powers that come with it. They changed it now to where you  have to buy the powers and the episodes. Its a complete rip. I liked it back in the day where you bought the dlcs and you got the powers that came with it. That seemed to have changed after march of this year. Over all its still a good game. The only con for me is after coming back from 4 year hiatus on ps3 and making the switch to pc. That alot haves changed in their money purchases. So if your going to buy the dlcs beaware they dont offer the powers with them you have to buy them seperately.			"

												Once, there was a time, when dcuo was amazing.  Some of the best ideas for a super hero game put together. But sadly whoever was in controle rode this once great mmo to the ground.  I feel it all started with the easy ban, from chat, comments from fourms, yet hackers nah they are fine.  Speekhackers are riddled threw out the game, not to mention soe tends to blame people for there broken game.  I'm sorry but if you have a game with a broken drop rate, it will be exploted, how bout making your game work properly and not bleed your fan base for ever dime they have.  Not to mention, this game is pretty much complete play to win, so for anyone who has not tryed the game, you will be a fly til you buy dlc or become a Legendary member.   I played dcuo for years but I have had it with there complete disregard for there fans of the game and comics alike.  SOE left a huge sour taste in my mouth from this game, which was a big drain on my life, wasted hours saving money and collected items that would just be turned useless over night.  Grind your way threw raid hell, when you haven't a full party that is in sync.  Not to mentioned the bs Items they tryed to award people for adding new players, recruiter pack, which pretty much makes almost anyone op once they have it, but at this point I cant recommend anyone this game. 3 years ago maybe but now, hell no. Go where you will be treated better, but DCUO is a ruined game.			"

												DCUO is a little bipolar about its pay structure- it's free/microtransactions/subscription. The subscription is for multiple games, though, so certainly work it if you also play Planetside 2 or other Sony games. The microtransactions and DLCs are enticing, but not required for enjoying the game.To be honest, I never felt like the game was limiting me as a free player. I did have lots of cool content dangled in front of me that was paid content, but I could always keep playing for free with PLENTY of options and new gear and powers being unlocked in-game around every corner.Getting a DLC is worth it just to raise your character, inventory, and money caps. You could still easily play and have fun for months before running out of quests on a free character, and you could then just start a new character with one of the 5 other mentors to get a whole new set of quests. The versitility of this game is wonderful. Character customization in this game blows me away compared to other games, even CoH.If you are willing to pay for extra content, there are always new DLCs coming out with new powers and storylines. The DLCs are inexpensive and go on sale quite often.Downside: the game takes up massive hard drive space. 20GB local storage. I couldn't do it on console because of that. Also, some of the features seem incomplete, such as an awkward and possibly broken chat system, poor voice chat options, and R&D items that seem to have no function in the game. I can deal with these because they can easily be ignored and at best are promises for future systems that might actually work.			"

If you like super heroes or villains and want to play a third person game that is free, this is the game for you people! The cool thing about this game is that you could get eight friends and play a multiplayer mission with them! Its also so addictive to want to level up!

												Yet another title I've logged many more hours off of steam than on, I've played this game for a good year or so. Although I am guilty of purchasing the complete bundle I did start as F2P so I can relate. I do very much enjoy this game but it does have it's problems.Pros:-Graphics are good-Good basic tutorial when you start-Great storyline for each mentor (Lex, Circe, Joker. Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman)-Cool Powers (Nature, Sorcery, Ice, Fire, Mental, Gadgets [Starters]. Electricity, Quantum, Celestial, Rage, Earth, and light [DLC])-Decent Character Customization-Good AI-Lots of missions-Fun PVP-You can be a (super) villain! Who doesn't want to be a (super) villain?Cons:-Shared objectives and high player count at lower levels makes early mission completion tedious-F2P needs more options-Gameplay feels slow at times-Mission objectives get repetative-Missions can be long-Certain things need better tutorials -Leveling can be slow-Money cap at 2000, now this one probably pisses me off the most. As you get your character to higher levels you want to buy higher level gear right? Well that gear costs more than $2000. Well then you're out of luck aren't you? Unless you buy a premium account. After you do that you can transfer your money in escrow and have a higher (or infinite) cap. I wouldn't know, I have $7000 in escrow right now.			"

												A game being free is worth a look, and a game being about super powers is even more worth a look.The graphics are decent.The controls are simple.The audio is simple.The tasks, missions and achievements are all the same thing, beat people up.I like the game, I really do.  I love flying and doing missions, but I got 2 problems that I noticed.1.  When flying (If you choose that super power) and flying fast threw all the colours and buildings etc, you will notice you start to feel sick.  I did all the time when flying, up down, up down, left right all well colours on your screen.  Very disorientating. (How ever it is spelt)2.  Every mission has the same thing to do and outcome, go here beat this guy up and his hench men or pose... and report back.  This becomes very very boring soon, and then when you max rank you just spend most of your time helping others with a mission because no more really unlock.Then you hit the pay wall.  The wall asking you to pay for ALL the DLC because you are extremely limited to your class and what to do, and then it goes all down hill from there.You can max rank, you can do quiet a lot of stuff, but if you want to use green lantern or people like that.  It is pay us money and that is a no no.The game is worth the time you put into it.  After all, free super hero but it is not worth the money I think, which I am glad I did not pay.You are a super hero that can be killed by a basic mob... You never feel powerful or strong like a super hero is. It has small other problems, like you get a small bag size, to buy a bigger it is real money, to do certain stats it is real money.Otherwise you spend lots of time getting small stuff and just doing the story and quests which I have no problem with :)			"

												It's nice if ya like superheroes, customization, and fighting.On Base GameGameplayMost of the time you're grinding like any other basic MMORPG, but the incentive here is to find legendary loot that gives you ""styles"", which are customization items. It's actually a unique system that is pretty cool, since you can get stronger gear without changing your appearance. The combat is well done, basically melee and ranged for each weapon that all have a skill tree, with 6 base powers thrown in where you could build two different power trees. This enables quite a nice variation in fighting that you don't see often in other games, though most of the later games will make you end up choosing a role or going DPS, which all follow a tree some random guys posted on Youtube.Boss fights and adds are all the same thing, just meatshields until you get the drops you want. There aren't many variations in the  base instances and alerts (dungeons), and most of the time, there will be one player that is like two times the CR of everyone else in the party, slaughtering everything.AtmosphereThe story is meh for both sides of Hero and Villain factions that you can choose. It's essentially the same story, just flipped and woozied for good and evil. The only noticeable stray from the basic plot is that you can choose 3 different mentor superheroes on each side, allowing you to follow Metahuman, Technological, or Magical storylines. It's cool and all, but though you're supposed to play the game as your OWN superhero, you end up acting as a sidekick to your mentor or they become nerfed enough for you to contribute more than jack squat.Graphics are okay, you could prolly handle them at 60fps if you're a PC nut, but it's still suprisingly playable at 25 fps. Just don't be so nappy about the graphics and try installing ENBs and such, since you could get banned for it.On DLCDon't be scared to play, it's still free up to a certain point, which is optional. I've played the game for 3 years or so (not Steam version) and it does not require payment until you reach around CR70~ for story continuation DLC, but this is well past level 30. I've managed to play for a looooong time without spending a single cent, and only chose to buy a shield just to try it out. Really, if you want to play, just pay about ~15 USD for membership every month to get all content, or pay 5 bucks for trading access. I recommend, if you really want to get upper-tier, membership is the best way to play and get competitive in both PVE and PVP.Should ya get it?Yes. Friends are optional, but they add fun if you get really competitive. For some reason, this is the one game I retire to after I find all my other games boring. There's just this little spark about it that I like.			"

												FOR NOW this is what im giving it. I have been playing the game for 5 years on playstation and now im on PC. What I LIKE: The game is fun and addicting, the powers are cool and seeing DC heroes both in open world and in missions are aslo awesome. There are a ton of good things about this game! tons of content  the community is mostly nice and helpful (if new: Always go on Youtube and look up boss fights and raids before entering) and with the new Director he is making big changes for the better to make the game more.... current.What I DONT LIKE: is the pay wall. F2P until level 30, P2P for everything else after. You cant even finish the main story without buying the DLC's. Every additional Power must be bought with money and even some core items for gameplay. There is so much DLC that paying for all of it use to enjoy the game is annoying. also you have to ""subcribe"" to use all your in-game money and inventory slots otherwise you have to put real money into getting access to use your ingame money once. (Tons of videos to see what i mean). You almost have to be rich to play the game at ever turn there's a pay wall. MINI ISSUES: Graphics, Unreal engine and animations are all outdates (like most mmorpg looks the same as it did 5 years ago) animations and phyics can be annoying. UI is 5 years old and is super buggy. everyone uses the same powers for maximum damage (might be changing soon see DCUO Forums)I will change my review when the game changes. I love the game because its awesome I get to be a superpowered freak of nature around almost all my fav super heroes and villains. I've learned a lot about DC from playing this and am very passionate about it but these are my thoughts. there are good changes coming to the game soon but it is worth playing just not really worth all the money atm.

												I have played many different MMOS in my gaming lifetime, but DC Universe is more than you run of the mill sand box MMO.  DC Universe not only pokes the inner commic nerd, MMOer, but the customizable options are second to none.  Also, like most free to play games, there is an option which again differs greatly from most MMOs.  The ""pay to win"" option, where in fact with DC Universe... this option is more like pay to gain yet even MORE customizable options.  Such as wider span of powers, lair (YES you get a lair of your own ... very cool) options, and BIGGER bank roll (everyone loves more money).   The DC cummunity also stands out, just about everyone is helpfull... so you have a boss you can't solo... you can always find one or more players welling to hop into the fray with ya to get it done.  All in all ... it is quite challenging to find negatives about this action packed, super commic MMO!!   If you grew up loving DC commics... than look no further, if you don't believe me I challenge you to try it out yourself and not enjoy it! LOL.			"

												If you've ever enjoyed a DC anything - but especially the animated series or, you know, the comics proper - you'll get a kick out of this. Also great if you love dressup, and boy howdy, do I ever!Free-to-play ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is surprisingly limited here. Biggest limitation is probably for-pay respecs (here's a hint: don't pick the sexy pose personality if you want your character to have a spine) and character slot limitations. The latter becomes moot if you pay $5 for anything, as you get 6 slots (up from 2) and there's 6 'mentor' characters. Expansions are $10 a pop and unlock new power options (that are still by no means necessary or unbalanced), go to town.			"

I DONTYes i reccomend this game but, in order to get all DLC's (""free"") and unlimited in-game cash and unlimited characters you need to pay $14.99 a month or $120 year.In my opinion this sucks BUT!!!! AMAZING GAME! heros villians facing each other! fighting cool and uniquue bosses and enemies! PVP! dueling! LOOT! AMAZING CUSTOMIZATION! AND FINALLY... FREE!! (not including monthly payment)I woud like to add more::: 3/19/2014 Update:::The game has a Kinda short story and multipiple endings (batman, supes, wonder woman) each with differet quests and rewards) Along with that once lvl 30 (max) you are weak. REALLLY WEAK. So you need to improve somthing called combat rating by doing duo or single challenges. BUT!!! in order to do tier 2 to unlock t2 armor you NEED dlc's. WONDERFUL! yea not so much.

I have mixed feeling about this game because actually it's P2W :// It has good graphics, good combat system, character customization, DC heroes... But some parts of the world are same and it's a bit boring after a while. Quests are also boring... kill x enemies, take x reward. It is also not well enough optimised... Overall give it a try.			"

												Lets keep this breif. If you always wanted to be a Super Hero and you want a game thats free to play, Then this is the game for you. You will be enticed to become a member or buy dlc, both of which I have done, and also Recommend to get the full experience, but if you just want a world to dive in as a casual game then free to play still works. This game is huge, and keeps growing, but unlike other FTP games out there you will be required to either buy the dlc or get a membership which gives you everything to use; as it should, to get to the front lines or highest levels of the game. This is not Pay to Win though just to open up new lvls and worlds, you will still have to grind to get gear to be the best and unlock feats to unlock skill points to make yourself into the strongest character possible, but its worth it at least for me. You can be a hero or a villian and now with cross faction play you can queue up for events on either side and there is very little wait time. ( a huge inprovement.)Without giving a lot away this is like WOW except with superheroes, in that its addictive, highly customizable, and constantly growing. I have been playing for a very long time and will be playing probably until the end of the franchize so I may be biased but as someone who has devoted a lot of time and resource to the game I can recommend it, and DO.Try it for free, if you like it great, if not it cost you nothing.

												Definitely worth a shot. Operating in the DC universe and interacting with its characters is tons of fun, and in my opinon, the combat system does the best job (compared to other superhero mmo's) in allowing players to create characters as varied and complex as those found in their favorite superhero comics.      One drawback, as with all f2p's, is how much free-account players are limited in terms of extra story content, gear, and extra game functions. That being said, the game is plenty vast and engaging for those who want to enjoy the game without spending a dime. Also, the amount of costume customization options don't measure up to those of, say, City of Heroes (RIP), and may also be more limited than those of Champions Online, but the game in general looks so beautiful and vibrant that I was content working to unlock costume sets instead of wallowing in nerd-anguish over the disparity between the look of my character in my imagination and the look I was able to achieve in-game.

												When I first started the game the controls were easy to control if you have played batman arkham origins. The game is good for the average pc gamer bot if your a begginer you can jump right in because this is more of a clicking smashing game but there is your hotbar of special attacks. All i know is the Batman mentor storyline and most of it is pretty straight forward. The game has great graphics for sony standards... The only downfall is that the storline is toooo plain not much of charater interation your set in Gotham City with missions.

At the time of writing I've not yet purchased a thing, and this doesn't seem to have hampered me or my enjoyment at all. Lots of customisation options, and responsive controls. I'm not sure whether it would be quite my style to play alone, but I've had a great time with friends. Well worth a go.			"

												As an MMORPG, this game gets kinda dull and grindy after you hit the level cap, with everything seemingly geared toward group raids, the gear treadmilll, and free-to-play stuff designed to make you want to pay for a subscription and/or spend money on not-so-micro transactions.But as a superhero action-RPG, this game is fantastic.   The part you can play for free is one of the best single-player open-world superhero games ever made (with lots of optional opportunities for co-op or PvP).  The game is much more action-oriented than most online RPG's, with movement mechanics, power knockback, and throwing environmental stuff all significant parts of the combat.  With lots of alternate missions depending on your mentor, a bunch of different powersets to try out, and both hero & villain factions, I've enjoyed taking several characters through the Level 1-30 single-player game and even bought some of the DLC to try out a few of the newer powersets.Also no game does a better job of making you feel like a superhero when you fly (or glide or grapple or speedrun or surf) around the city.  The character creator is somewhat limited, but the way gear works is great.  New gear buffs your character stats and gives you new styles for tweaking your superhero look. Most importantly, you can keep whatever style or look you want regardless of which gear you actually have equipped for stat purposes.If you enjoy superheroes, just designing a character and flying around  Metropolis or Gotham (which look great) in DCUO is more fun than many entire superhero games.  Even if you don't like MMOs, there a ton of great single-player content here that is completely free.  And maybe you'll enjoy the MMO stuff more than I did.			"

												Definitely worth a shot. Operating in the DC universe and interacting with its characters is tons of fun, and in my opinon, the combat system does the best job (compared to other superhero mmo's) in allowing players to create characters as varied and complex as those found in their favorite superhero comics.      One drawback, as with all f2p's, is how much free-account players are limited in terms of extra story content, gear, and extra game functions. That being said, the game is plenty vast and engaging for those who want to enjoy the game without spending a dime. Also, the amount of costume customization options don't measure up to those of, say, City of Heroes (RIP), and may also be more limited than those of Champions Online, but the game in general looks so beautiful and vibrant that I was content working to unlock costume sets instead of wallowing in nerd-anguish over the disparity between the look of my character in my imagination and the look I was able to achieve in-game.

												Good game but for those who use paypal for their online transactions the game sucks because you can't do anything beyond lvl 30 unless you give up your creditcard details and risk being hacked and have your money being sucked up by random people and there''s no way to change it because the people in charge of payment methods don't care about the safety of their subscribers money  because they don't have paypal option for membership purchase and don't plan to put it in which is bad because there a lot of hackers out their looking for creditcard details and they could most likely get it from this game and when I went to the support area and submitted a tcket about my concerns they gave me a very rude reply so I have to unfortunetly have to give it a 0 out of 10 and warn everyone to stay clear of this game if you value you creditcard details and not get hacked and have to replace your card and number.But good luck to those who have already gone and purchased a membership online.

												DCUO is a great superhero MMO. that being said, its the only one currently out there. balance is bad. lower tiers can be harder than higher tiers. this game uses marks to buy gear, and when you progress, you can no longer earn marks from instances in lower tiers. combat is fun, but repetitive. character builds dont vary too much at all. creating characters with many different powers and having a league hall and your own personal lair--all these are fun. maybe wait until they fix the problems created with ""rebalancing"". overall, i recommend the game. expect to pay about $10 per episode (after tier 3, about 2-3 episodes per tier) or buy the episode packs. if you are a comic book nerd, you will love it, but be prepared to put up with a lot of seriously dumb design decisions.

												A while back I heard this game wasn't worth bothering with. I can't remember who told me that, but they were either full of ♥♥♥♥, or the game has undergone some massive improvements since said person played it. Previously, my favorite superhero game was Champions online, and while DC Universe Online has significantly less customization features than champions, everything else seems to be improved greatly. First lets get the cons out of the way.Don't get me wrong, DCUO has some excellent character customization, and I was able to create several characters that somewhat fit the image I had for them when I began to create them, and it's important to keep in mind that there are more ""styles"" you can discover as you play through the game that are not available from the character creator that can be changed even after character creation, similarly to Champions. However, unlike Champions, there are several aspects of your character that are locked after the character creation, such as your character's body type, stance, power set, travel power, and skin type.Another minor gripe i have with DCUO is the size of the world. Normally for me this would be a big problem, but there are many DLC packs that expand upon the world, one of which even adding brand new city. For free players the game almost exclusively takes place in Gotham City and Metropolis, with some alerts (dungeons) taking place in other places such as area 51, and another on the moon. I don't currently plan to buy all the DLCs due to my situation for money, but i'm considering maybe slowly purchasing the DLCs over time.the last problem I have with the game is that unless you are subscribed, at $15 a month, your currency will be capped at $2000 which makes the auction broker unusable at level 30 unless you subscribe as everything for sale is over $2000.With the complaints out of the way, lets get to why I love this game.1. The Combat:One of the biggest things that turned me off to champions online was the combat. It used the stale system made popular by WoW of tab targetting to who you wanted to attack and pressing a button until it dies. In DCUO there is a soft targetting system similar to the Elder Scrolls Online, where you will target whoever is closest, both to the center of your screen and to your character, with the ability to lock your target if you needed to focus on a highly mobile target, which is very helpful for ranged characters. You must block heavy attacks that most enemies will attempt to stun you with, and there is the ability for all power/weapon sets to dodge, but this is more useful for escaping aoe attacks than for anything else. The weapon you choose will determine what combos you have with your mouse clicks, with all weapons sharing a control scheme in common with left click being a light melee attack, left hold being a heavy ranged interrupt, right click being a light ranged attack, and right hold being a heavy ranged block breaker (that can still be used in melee distance)If you fail to block an enemy's heavy attack, or an enemy blocks your attack, you will be stunned momentarily, this can be broken out of at the cost of some energy using the block button.meanwhile your power sets determine some of your heaviest hitting abilities, unlike weapon combos, these abilities cost energy to use, making weapon combos still highly viable over abilities as they cost no energy to use. This, in my opinion, creates a fantastic balance between powers and weapons, making you want to use both in equal measure instead of spamming one button until an enemy dies.2. Improved Travel Powers:While i will admit Champions online has a HUGE selection of travel powers to choose from than DCUO, the travel powers in DCUO are much more interesting to use, and unlike champions, also come with their own seperate skill trees. You can choose from either flight, superspeed, or acrobatics. In flight...well...you can fly, but unlike champions your character has momentum while flying through the air, making much smoother turns, and providing a challenge to some of the flight challenges found in the city, also if you fly down towards the ground your character will gain a speed boost, which, with some points spent in the flight skill tree, can be used as an opening attack in a fight. the first skill in the flight skill tree also gives the user the ability to fly in any direction with the speed normally given by diving towards the ground at the cost of a reduced mouse sensitivity, making it much harder to turn.I haven't tried superspeed so i can't tell you what makes it special, but i see plenty of people using it so it must be as fun as the others.Acrobatics in champions gave you improved run speed, that was less than superspeed but gave you the ability to jump higher. in DCUO acrobatics doesn't make your jump go higher, but provides a double jump instead, which makes it feel more involved, in addition it comes with a glide ability that works similarly to the gliding mechanic in prototype, and the ability to climb up walls as well, with points spent in the acrobatics tree 2 additions are made to it, holding the glide button while in range of a wall will launch a grappling hook to reel you into it quickly, and doing the same while climbing a wall will make you grapple up to the top at an incredible speed. While acrobatics at a low level is the slowest power, the grappling mechanic gives it the highest potential for speed for those with the talent to do so.3. Narration:In Champions online, there were of course a couple cutscenes, some of which were voiced, but for the most part the quests worked like they did back in vanilla WoW. you talk to several NPCs, some text tells you to go kill 10 mobs and return to them. In DCUO, the entire story is narrated, sometimes by oracle (for heroes) or calculator (for villains), and other times by one of the 3 mentor heroes or villains you can choose at the start of the game, such as batman, superman, wonderwoman, and for villains, the Joker, Lex Luthor, and Circe.Through my time playing so far, i have not once been asked to turn in a quest at an NPC, as all quest rewards can be collected directly from your quest journal, which will automatically assign the next quest in the mini story.4. The Skill Trees:While champions online had excellent ability customization for freeform characters, it got a little confusing when trying to level up your skills. While i dislike that the powers do not give the same freedom of customization as the weapon skills do, the interface for leveling up both weapons and powers is a huge improvement from champions. There are no trainers, and instead every time you level up you get a point to spend in powers and/or weapons, for each power set there are two styles to choose from, and once you reach level 10 you can also choose from a third tree that includes ""iconic powers"" such as superman's heat vision and frost breath. Or even a baterang volley.TLDR version:This game has its flaws, but it makes up for it and overall is a highly enjoyable game i would recomend to anyone who at least mildly enjoys superheroes			"

												RevisitThe game as a concept is quite ambitious allowing you to create your own unique (or loosely inspired by) hero and place them into the DC Universe home to some of the most famous heroes and villains. Having executed that idea it is quite fun... for a while. The main ""campaign"" or whatever you'd like to call it is everything I could have asked for from a DC mmo experience. It is a surprisingly fufilling experience which I would guess is an 80+ hours depending how many friends you have to help. In that aspect it is one of the best F2P games you can get. The story alone is longer than some P2P games and you have multiple storylines and endgame raids etc. Personally I had no desire to play the Superman or Wonder Woman campaigns after spending so much time on one character. It would be a great option to let you play through all of them on one character for more playtime. The endgame wasn't as exciting as I'd hoped. I'm not a big mmorpg player but what I've played is overly ""grindy"" playing scenarios from levels you beat over and over til you get enough points to do the same thing on a higher difficulty. I have memories of playing Runescape and all the quests you could do on your own before getting into the more involved part of the game. I don't have friends who play and it's impossible to make any from the broken chat and the lack of easily accessible microphone chat. The chat is flooded by ways to get millions of in game cash for $12 and people looking for groups of players that I'm not a high enough level to join. Whenever I tried to use the chat there isn't a global setting I could find, only a long range local chat. Perhaps if there was an easier way to get gear without grinding my braincells away I could enjoy it a bit more. As is, there's a solid story mode and some fun gameplay with some very fluid combat. I remember when I used to play runescape or WoW the combat was just a stiff animation. In this game it feels like you really fight the enemy instead of watch a red damage number attack your enemy.

												I bought this game back when it first launched, still can't forget that hideous cover art.  I've played both PS3 and PC version and in my opinion, the PS version is superior. It gets patches faster and a lot more people are playing there. However they will introduce crossplay soon which will allow PC and PS players play together which is just what this game needs. The biggest flaw is the low population on PC. There are almost twice as many players on the PS servers so if you're interested then I highly suggest you try it on PS first. I play on EU servers, so this might not apply to US servers.This game is however extremely fun to play, whether you're a fan of the comics or not. This game actually made me interested in reading the comics, since I had only seen a few DC movies and animated series before.Once you get a good league or a few friends together you will have a ton of stuff to do, both in PvE and PvP.I play PvE most of the time and it can keep me busy all day with Alerts, Ops, Duos, Solo's and Raids.Not to mention the vast amount of daily quest which can help you gear up rather quickly.However, this game is limited as hell for a free player. And if you want to experience all that this game has to offer you have to pay monthly.But if you want to have fun as a free player with a friend, you can up to a certain point. You will maybe get 10-20 hours out of the game before you really start feeling limited. Tl;dr: Fun game if you pay monthly. PS > PC "

												It's a fun, free game. If you've got time to fill and fancy the levelling experience with a nice bit of story thrown in, give it a go. Some combat styles can be fun to combo with. Some challenges can be tough enough to be challenging. Yeah, fun free game. Also, the DLC (that adds sequentially higher tier raids and content per DLC) are pretty cheap, so there’s more if you fancy it.			"

												A great game for anyone who, like me, loves the DC universe.The visuals are good, the gameplay is fun and the story is interesting. I mean, who doesn't want to run, jump or fly around Gotham, Metropolis, etc helping their favorite heroes/villans? It's a really great experience.However, if you do not have a subscription, you'll soon feel some heavy limitations towards the freebie players:You can't have more than 1.500 credits at once - the excess goes to the ""escrow"", and can only be recovered buying an item in the market - , a lot of powers have to be enabled via paid DLCs (some of the coolest, you can be sure of this), there are only 2 character slots (and that's way too few, given the customization options, like hero/villan, movement type, mentor, power, primary and secondary weapon, etc), etc.All in all this is a good game. If you liked it and want a really satisfying experience though, go for the subscription.			"

												Would not recommend this game by far 7200 hours on this game in 4 years ( toooo much time ).  The bad out weighs  the good seeing how the good is slowing being destroyed by a money ran dev team. The Good: Movement options are great since they give you various options to gank/ enter battles. Acro was my got to for everything but tanking since the skills you can learn weren't meant for it unless you want to power single target pulls; to it's credit the super move is good for tanking. Flight is a cheap way to find collectables and beat everyone not experienced in superspeed and superspeed is good for speedruns with experience. The combat is superb, 3rd person perspective getting the chance to admire your nude cowboy Rage Dps while they chain whip things. Controls were meant for a controller considering a port from the PS, If your gonna use keyboard make sure you know it because 1-+ will be used on a norm at fast paces considering your dlc ownership. Character creation is good, not great because you need dlcs to make your character truely have options. You can Lock your suit in if you like your starter character or change it while your not in combat anywhere in game.The Bad:The company wants your money period JENS said it on a stream, since Amazon Fury came out the content is now noticeably reused and called new. Dlc is $10 and can only be used with cash and they made being a member damn near needed since free players have limited broker usage, have a 1.5k spending limit and can't trade (haven't stayed free long enough to get all the info). Premium players 14 extra Inventory slots-12 extra Bank slots-4 extra Character slots-Ability to Trade Items with other players-$2k spending limit-Proximity chat-Vault access every 3 day. This game has the ftp model try before you buy, Soe doesn't want server space being used for non-paying customers, if i was wrong they wouldn't have the ridiculous limitations on this game. Community: if your lucky you'll find friends to carry you being anything but legendary. Premiums get a pass only if you have participating dlcs. Pvp is a travesty of High lvls/Cr pounding lowbies, being a new player you won't have the experience to tackle the cr/stat challenge. High skilled/ can strip all their gear off and beat a rush to t6 pvp players everyone else is just roaches waiting to be squashed. The amount of MMOOK spam in chat is f*cked up, ignoring them is a option but they're like a Horrible Joke, once you think they're gone; they're back again (MMOOK is a spam site trying to trade ingame cash for real cash). Ask yourself, is the game worth spending money on? The necessary $5 to spend to avoid FTP could be put somewhere else,something more constructive (buying an animal would be more constructive than DCUO). By next year, they will re-release content for full price with ""incentives"" because they won't need to create anything new/;the dedicated players/new players will eat it up with all the nerfs and rehashed crap.

												A free to play MMO, DC Universe Online is a game that attempts to make MMO combat more exciting and involving, rather than just 'click and wait'; the combat plays out similarly to an action game, with many different weapon and power types, each with their own animations and unlockable combos. This helps keep the game feeling fresh through multiple character playthroughs, although the combat eventually becomes somewhat repetitive, and it doesn't help that most of the quests are 'Kill 30 enemies' or 'Destroy 10 things'; the formula rarely changes.Navigating the world is enjoyable due to the fun travel powers (which are unlocked from the beginning), although flying feels boring in comparison to super speed or athletics.Needless to say, DC fans are the ones who will get the most enjoyment out of this game, with many iconic locations to explore in the worlds of Metropolis and Gotham, and countless famous foes to square off against.TL;DR: If you are a fan of MMO's and a fan of DC superheroes (or supervillains), you should definitely try this game.

												Marvel always creates the greatest comic book games, and this game is no exception. You first get to choose either batironhul or spiwidoman to play as, then you jump right into the horse breeding. The horse breeding in this game is even better than the horse breeding in Halo 3(which was the good 'ol days of horse breeding). I am so proud to say I am a DC comics fan because marvel made this game so well. Whenever another game lets you jump on a horse, fly it around New York city along side spiderman, shoot webs out of your horse butt and save gotham city from penguins, come talk to me. This game is amazing. 0/10 Do not buy this game.			"

												Cool customization, some iconic voice actors, stuff and things. There are some paywalls, but they're mainly just cosmetics, boosters, and powers that are exceptionally rare in the comics and movies, so it makes sense that almost no one would have them normally. Otherwise there are like... no cons that i can see, or atleast not any major ones, aside from no button to toggle between running and walking slowly, and theres a poor excuse for furries, so if you're coming to this game for furries, don't bother, they're just humans with fur, ears, and tails, no animal-shaped heads, they're ugly. BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT i'm sure you'll find something to do. I admit its not for everyone, but it is interesting. And has a cool story. But whatever, brains 'n stuff aen't working right now. I'll probably modify this review a second time later, but i'm having a hard time thinking right now.			"

												Okay I might be a little addicted...Okay I'm nearing the 4000 hour gameplay mark after 3 years of playing, some of my friends are over the 8000 hour mark... and the Devs keep adding stuff to keep me and my friends addicted. Even when you just want to wander around and farm things it's fun, if you wanna get serious and get your feats and do some raids it's fun, then they add a ton of solo missions that you could spend all your time doing if I didn't feel like playing with anyone ever! It's like they deliberately thought of everything just to keep every type of player hooked!  Down right devious!I've made a few vids:  Here's one of one of my lairs

For people like me that don't like using a headset in a MMO the chat system is our only option to communicate. This lowers the experience in the game.**Update.Last game update really makes a difference in graphics. Still, the chat remains the same.			"

												Cons: The premise: A thrown away game in a thrown away version of a thrown away continuity. The Gameplay: A console MMO poorly ported to Windows. So badly so that the use of simple macros and a programmable keyboard, mouse or game controller has allowed the game's PvE and moreso PvP to be dominated by cheaters and sploiters. Ancient bugs and issues that have not been even addresses since launch. Pay to Win model. So much bad.Pros: If you're into that sort of thing this game has a large vibrant and diverse DC Universe based role playing community. There are no other redeeming values. Truly. None.			"

												Alright,if you're a dc fan,or a superhero lover! or even if you like mmorpgs keep reading.This game is so addicting honestly,I played once and couldn't stop playing the danm game,you get to choose what powers you have,they might be a little generic but hey YOU choose! You choose so much in the game!,ranging from how you travel,to how you fight off Sinister Villians or Prideful Heroes,its all up to you! There is so much to do you won't get bored with the game for atleast a month! The mmorpg side to it is amazing!,lots of people you can play with,and ITS FREE,your friends can get it and you can have a blast!,You can group up with friends and take on missions together!This game dosen't force you to buy anything with real money!,if you do happen to buy something with real money,you'll get some benefits but nothing that will help you over power anyone ""Free to play"" in combat. They have alot of DLC you can buy!,they give you extra powers to choose from,my personal faviorite is War of the Light,It gives you a new power called ""Rage"" and gives you some missions to day with you friends (On duty). This game has so much to offer,you should take advantage that it is a free game!,with so much to do,and so much to explore this game provides a very fun time for any geek,when you play you're with a big family of comic book lovin' friends!(I'm not paid by Sony to make this reveiw :P,this is just my review on the game!)I would give this game a 9/10,very fun,you can play on here for long amounts of time and not even notice!,very addiciting,this game is way too fun!

												A great game for anyone who, like me, loves the DC universe.The visuals are good, the gameplay is fun and the story is interesting. I mean, who doesn't want to run, jump or fly around Gotham, Metropolis, etc helping their favorite heroes/villans? It's a really great experience.However, if you do not have a subscription, you'll soon feel some heavy limitations towards the freebie players:You can't have more than 1.500 credits at once - the excess goes to the ""escrow"", and can only be recovered buying an item in the market - , a lot of powers have to be enabled via paid DLCs (some of the coolest, you can be sure of this), there are only 2 character slots (and that's way too few, given the customization options, like hero/villan, movement type, mentor, power, primary and secondary weapon, etc), etc.All in all this is a good game. If you liked it and want a really satisfying experience though, go for the subscription.			"

												If you are a fan of the DC universe, or enjoy the idea of making your very own super villain or super hero and flying around Gotham or Metropolis, download this and give it a go! Don't worry about the end game, or best combination of powers. Make the hero or villain you want to be and experience the story. If you really like it, worry about making the 'ideal' character the second time around and look towards end game.Half the fun for me is flying around finding the investigations from DC reports like Jack Ryder, Lois Lane and Vicki Vale. Not to mention the story missions that have you fighting the likes of Scarecrow and Bane in Gotham, or the possessed Teen Titans.Worth a try, you can play 1-30 with a good range of character choices for free. If you enjoy it just a little, investing in 1 DLC pack for a new power set will net you premium membership and 6 character slots. Alternatively a monthly fee of ~$15 will net you all DLC I believe and unlimited access to all areas of the game.			"

												I played this came for thousands of hours way back when it came out on console, nice to see how the game has evolved. Only downside to it is the expensive add-ons but thats about it, its not pay to win at all but its funny to see all the negative reviews claiming this. You pay for DLC, cosmetics, unlocks to features locked behind membership. Hardly pay to win.The company has just chosen to lock most of the game behind a subscription, which I dont mind as long the game is still alive and being updated. You CAN pay to get a boost characters and I really dont see how you could call this a pay-to-win features, ive done all of the stories literally hundreds of times it gets boring and painfull to level someone new so having the option to skip is great. I like the end-game content its where the game shines, nice to grind certain raids for an item I like.They do however need to change the whole subscription system coming back as a Premium player sucks ♥♥♥ I cant even repair gear due to the credit limit, this is just stupid and needs changing, your forced to sub essentially			"

												Alright,if you're a dc fan,or a superhero lover! or even if you like mmorpgs keep reading.This game is so addicting honestly,I played once and couldn't stop playing the danm game,you get to choose what powers you have,they might be a little generic but hey YOU choose! You choose so much in the game!,ranging from how you travel,to how you fight off Sinister Villians or Prideful Heroes,its all up to you! There is so much to do you won't get bored with the game for atleast a month! The mmorpg side to it is amazing!,lots of people you can play with,and ITS FREE,your friends can get it and you can have a blast!,You can group up with friends and take on missions together!This game dosen't force you to buy anything with real money!,if you do happen to buy something with real money,you'll get some benefits but nothing that will help you over power anyone ""Free to play"" in combat. They have alot of DLC you can buy!,they give you extra powers to choose from,my personal faviorite is War of the Light,It gives you a new power called ""Rage"" and gives you some missions to day with you friends (On duty). This game has so much to offer,you should take advantage that it is a free game!,with so much to do,and so much to explore this game provides a very fun time for any geek,when you play you're with a big family of comic book lovin' friends!(I'm not paid by Sony to make this reveiw :P,this is just my review on the game!)I would give this game a 9/10,very fun,you can play on here for long amounts of time and not even notice!,very addiciting,this game is way too fun!

												I played this came for thousands of hours way back when it came out on console, nice to see how the game has evolved. Only downside to it is the expensive add-ons but thats about it, its not pay to win at all but its funny to see all the negative reviews claiming this. You pay for DLC, cosmetics, unlocks to features locked behind membership. Hardly pay to win.The company has just chosen to lock most of the game behind a subscription, which I dont mind as long the game is still alive and being updated. You CAN pay to get a boost characters and I really dont see how you could call this a pay-to-win features, ive done all of the stories literally hundreds of times it gets boring and painfull to level someone new so having the option to skip is great. I like the end-game content its where the game shines, nice to grind certain raids for an item I like.They do however need to change the whole subscription system coming back as a Premium player sucks ♥♥♥ I cant even repair gear due to the credit limit, this is just stupid and needs changing, your forced to sub essentially			"

												Pretty fun, about the most you can expect from an MMO. Progression feels natural and you aren't waiting for ages to level, and it's set in a very built universe, because, you know. DC Comics.The main gripe is heroes are really kiiiind of blighters. Camping low level villain quests is not a fun thing to do by the way, but that's a complaint more about the community than the game - people who think they're supermen are bound to appear in a comic book MMO.(I still prefer Marvel though.)

												If you want an MMO with a story, large availability of RP, great connectivity to other players, AND Free to Play experience, you will find yourself turning to this game for just that and abit more, most of the game is DLC content for those raising in Tiers, but is really simple, easy, and enjoyable over all, whether your free to play, premium, or legendary, this game no matter what will allow you to progress to t5.

DC Universe has a very similar vibe as Global Agenda, but I find it to be superior  to that in a few ways: It has a much richer environment, with huge open-world cities to explore, and there's always something going on; it has much more solo play ability; the rpg elements such as upgrading etc. are a lot easier to understand; and it's just very well designed, both in graphics and mechanics.

												A free to play MMO, DC Universe Online is a game that attempts to make MMO combat more exciting and involving, rather than just 'click and wait'; the combat plays out similarly to an action game, with many different weapon and power types, each with their own animations and unlockable combos. This helps keep the game feeling fresh through multiple character playthroughs, although the combat eventually becomes somewhat repetitive, and it doesn't help that most of the quests are 'Kill 30 enemies' or 'Destroy 10 things'; the formula rarely changes.Navigating the world is enjoyable due to the fun travel powers (which are unlocked from the beginning), although flying feels boring in comparison to super speed or athletics.Needless to say, DC fans are the ones who will get the most enjoyment out of this game, with many iconic locations to explore in the worlds of Metropolis and Gotham, and countless famous foes to square off against.TL;DR: If you are a fan of MMO's and a fan of DC superheroes (or supervillains), you should definitely try this game.

												DCUO is a great superhero MMO. that being said, its the only one currently out there. balance is bad. lower tiers can be harder than higher tiers. this game uses marks to buy gear, and when you progress, you can no longer earn marks from instances in lower tiers. combat is fun, but repetitive. character builds dont vary too much at all. creating characters with many different powers and having a league hall and your own personal lair--all these are fun. maybe wait until they fix the problems created with ""rebalancing"". overall, i recommend the game. expect to pay about $10 per episode (after tier 3, about 2-3 episodes per tier) or buy the episode packs. if you are a comic book nerd, you will love it, but be prepared to put up with a lot of seriously dumb design decisions.

												RevisitThe game as a concept is quite ambitious allowing you to create your own unique (or loosely inspired by) hero and place them into the DC Universe home to some of the most famous heroes and villains. Having executed that idea it is quite fun... for a while. The main ""campaign"" or whatever you'd like to call it is everything I could have asked for from a DC mmo experience. It is a surprisingly fufilling experience which I would guess is an 80+ hours depending how many friends you have to help. In that aspect it is one of the best F2P games you can get. The story alone is longer than some P2P games and you have multiple storylines and endgame raids etc. Personally I had no desire to play the Superman or Wonder Woman campaigns after spending so much time on one character. It would be a great option to let you play through all of them on one character for more playtime. The endgame wasn't as exciting as I'd hoped. I'm not a big mmorpg player but what I've played is overly ""grindy"" playing scenarios from levels you beat over and over til you get enough points to do the same thing on a higher difficulty. I have memories of playing Runescape and all the quests you could do on your own before getting into the more involved part of the game. I don't have friends who play and it's impossible to make any from the broken chat and the lack of easily accessible microphone chat. The chat is flooded by ways to get millions of in game cash for $12 and people looking for groups of players that I'm not a high enough level to join. Whenever I tried to use the chat there isn't a global setting I could find, only a long range local chat. Perhaps if there was an easier way to get gear without grinding my braincells away I could enjoy it a bit more. As is, there's a solid story mode and some fun gameplay with some very fluid combat. I remember when I used to play runescape or WoW the combat was just a stiff animation. In this game it feels like you really fight the enemy instead of watch a red damage number attack your enemy.

												I bought this game back when it first launched, still can't forget that hideous cover art.  I've played both PS3 and PC version and in my opinion, the PS version is superior. It gets patches faster and a lot more people are playing there. However they will introduce crossplay soon which will allow PC and PS players play together which is just what this game needs. The biggest flaw is the low population on PC. There are almost twice as many players on the PS servers so if you're interested then I highly suggest you try it on PS first. I play on EU servers, so this might not apply to US servers.This game is however extremely fun to play, whether you're a fan of the comics or not. This game actually made me interested in reading the comics, since I had only seen a few DC movies and animated series before.Once you get a good league or a few friends together you will have a ton of stuff to do, both in PvE and PvP.I play PvE most of the time and it can keep me busy all day with Alerts, Ops, Duos, Solo's and Raids.Not to mention the vast amount of daily quest which can help you gear up rather quickly.However, this game is limited as hell for a free player. And if you want to experience all that this game has to offer you have to pay monthly.But if you want to have fun as a free player with a friend, you can up to a certain point. You will maybe get 10-20 hours out of the game before you really start feeling limited. Tl;dr: Fun game if you pay monthly. PS > PC "

												It's a fun, free game. If you've got time to fill and fancy the levelling experience with a nice bit of story thrown in, give it a go. Some combat styles can be fun to combo with. Some challenges can be tough enough to be challenging. Yeah, fun free game. Also, the DLC (that adds sequentially higher tier raids and content per DLC) are pretty cheap, so there’s more if you fancy it.			"

												As an MMORPG, this game gets kinda dull and grindy after you hit the level cap, with everything seemingly geared toward group raids, the gear treadmilll, and free-to-play stuff designed to make you want to pay for a subscription and/or spend money on not-so-micro transactions.But as a superhero action-RPG, this game is fantastic.   The part you can play for free is one of the best single-player open-world superhero games ever made (with lots of optional opportunities for co-op or PvP).  The game is much more action-oriented than most online RPG's, with movement mechanics, power knockback, and throwing environmental stuff all significant parts of the combat.  With lots of alternate missions depending on your mentor, a bunch of different powersets to try out, and both hero & villain factions, I've enjoyed taking several characters through the Level 1-30 single-player game and even bought some of the DLC to try out a few of the newer powersets.Also no game does a better job of making you feel like a superhero when you fly (or glide or grapple or speedrun or surf) around the city.  The character creator is somewhat limited, but the way gear works is great.  New gear buffs your character stats and gives you new styles for tweaking your superhero look. Most importantly, you can keep whatever style or look you want regardless of which gear you actually have equipped for stat purposes.If you enjoy superheroes, just designing a character and flying around  Metropolis or Gotham (which look great) in DCUO is more fun than many entire superhero games.  Even if you don't like MMOs, there a ton of great single-player content here that is completely free.  And maybe you'll enjoy the MMO stuff more than I did.			"

												DC Universe Online is an incredibly well-done MMORPG.Unfortunately, it's a F2P MMO, so it ends up devolving into a P2W (Pay to Win).The game is plagued by tens of sets of DLC available for modifications to gameplay, available classes, skillsets, and just about every other element of the game. Hell, they've even got an option to pay to log on faster!So, without further ado, the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly:The Good:-Set in the DC Universe, which is good unless you're a diehard Marvel supporter.-Diverse powers and skills, each with an effect on your gameplay style.-The news reports, the e-mail system, and the data files all reward the player with interesting information pertaining to the settingThe Bad:-There are too many in-game currencies, and all but one of them is a cash cow for the game devs. -You can't use your base for anything but a teleportation destination unless you get the DLC.The Ugly:-The Booster Gold booths are annoying. REALLY annoying.-I can't figure out for the life of me which continuity I'm in. Renée Montoya is The Question; Jason Todd doesn't appear; Harley Quinn is still fangirling over the Joker; Bane fell off the wagon and started abusing Venom again (in the comics, he hasn't done this since the 80s); Azrael isn't a thing; Barbara is, as usual, crippled; no one will tell me which batgirl we have at the moment (I'm hoping it's Cassandra Cain); Tim Drake is Robin.Don't get me wrong. This game is amazing, especially for a fan of the DCU, which the game never fails to tie into by means of data files or news reports.I'm simply saying that you'd best not be expecting the Free-to-Play game to stay that way for long.

												It is a good game. In my own opinion I liked it because it was a third person view alongside being a hero in the DC. It is also a good start in the MMORPG World. Also I do like to have the chance to be mentored from my favorite characters like Batman and the Joker. I do want ot see that might be good for the game is the chance to be mentor to the more unconventional characters like Harley Quinn, Robin, Poison Ivy, Two-Face, Catwoman, Huntress. Also the storyline is good but the creator did get small wrongs in the storyline. Like how Huntress was in the game while catwoman was in the game at the same time. I a neophyte of the dc universe, but huntress was catwoman's daughtry and catwoman was suppose to be dead.			"

												Look at the time i played the game, says much...Main reason: I played that game back then( 3 years ago) because it was hard, you will never find any other game, that will have the same difficulty as this game had (the dificulty came from the mechanics of this game, it was not a question about gear, but your own personal skills (think of ""dark souls"")), therefore it was a challenge, it made me search for a good guild and find friends, if you wanted to play solo... forget it, thats what i liked. good guilds formed and competed with each other, everyone wanted to be the first and the best, and to acomplish it, you just needed your personal skills, no grinding for best gear, no p2w, only subscribe to play. Other reasons: Unique combat which was revolutionary when this game released, and still, until now i didnt find any other MMO where the combat is better or even the same. The best part about combat is, that you not only push your buttons and wait for the boss to die, the game asks you to do something special while fighting, so you have to interrupt combat. this way every single fight becomes unique and requires its own tactics. this feature is also unique, there is no other game that has it.This game is simple, there is not much crafting like in other mmos, no gathering 100 different types of materials, no upgrading gear to +20, no special bonusses on gear, which you have to study to understand and pay incredible amount of money to buy from other players to get or spend incredible amount of time grinding dungeons and hope it drops and what not all those WoW inspired MMOs have. because of this, this game has to provide hard content, where players fail and spend time trying to finish it, otherwise there would be not much to do, and it worked well back then, butthe dificulty was so high, that many ppl complained, that they could not finish content, because they lack personal skill and are unable to play as team and use tactics, so the devs desided to lower the dificulty and make it basically a brainAFK grindy game and every 3d month they release another content to grind, all players, who played this because of the high difficulty left and the game turned into a ghosttown, now the game slowly filles with players, because other players start to play who is ok with all the grinding, So if you are OK with brainAFK playstyle then definetly go for it, you will see a masterpiece of a MMO.earlyer i would have given it a YES, but because this game right now is nothing but a huge grind (in the end game), i will give it a no.

												I use to play this game on PS3 then ps4 for a few years. And the game was great. Then Free to play came, not to bad, more people to play with. But then you have a lot people start complaining about mechanics. This game shows what happens when developers listen to people who want everything to be easy, it breaks the game. It came to the point where you can run in groups without needing specific roles, making those roles more rare.Started the game on the hero side, there is a lot of players there making it unbalanced. There is also a lot of toxic people there so I switch over to the villain side. Villains believe it or not is actually a much friendlier and helpful side. Only down side is there is a lake of people there.Pros: Great if you are into comics or want to learn about them. I started with basic knowledge but this game really expands my knowledge on many characters, and it was great fighting along side them.Movements in the game is extremely different and fun. Having the ablilty to fly is just amazing, and you can go afk without worrying about anything attacking you.Switching between PvE and PvP is very nice. Especially when levelingCombat is very nice and fast pace. There's no GCD and auto attacks. You weave weapon attacks with power attacks and blocking; giveing you unique battling.Cons:They rushed the game now. When I first started, 30 being max level took me about a month to get there. Now you can do it in about a day. Yes most of the content is end game content but the leveling part is so that you can learn your role and powers. You'll tend to see a lot of people running content and don't know how to play their role correctly.Hard content doesn't really mean learning mechanics and counter it, it's more along the line of they have stupid amount of health and damage, just spend 20 minutes punching each other in the face. Other mmos usually have mechanics and phases.Useless roles. Now they aren't exactly useless but there are many times where people would run with more dps then a controller. Controllers are used to give power back to the party but they made weapon mastery which gave the user back their own power so they can be self sufficient.Change Duty Finder. They changed the way duty finder works by allowing a party to have any composition.  When usually it would be one healer, one dps, one controller and one tank. Now you can have any combination which generally means you'll have all dps. The group will be buffed with the skill of the missing role. eg: You'll get power back when you run low if there's no controller or Tanks will heal when blocking if there is no healer. If you were a healer, I've been ask multiple times to switch to dps since there is no controller to restore my power, so I can't keep heals up.No level sync. This is usually an annoying thing to be capped but this game makes me understand why. A max dps can run any lower dungeon by themselves (which makes you feel so powerful) but for the people looking to do it for the first time, usually they would be left behind and lost while the dps just one shot the boss and takes everything and leaves. Or worse, when leveling an alt, I was kicked out of the dungeon because these max geared friends says they can do it themselves and kicked everyone else out. Waiting in a 30 minute queue to have to requeue.			"

												I won't say this is the best game ever, it isn't. I mean, it's pretty fun, i enjoy the gameplay, the story, the costumization. It is a shame that it is basically P2W and DLC based. In August players had the chance to play episodes they didn't buy, which was pretty cool. If you don't buy the DLCs you're pretty much stuck in the same missions over and over again. I never bought a DLC or anything in this game, never spent a dime on DCUO but I am considering spending just a bit from time to time to get access to my escrow cash. Even with all this cons (P2W and many many DLCs) I still enjoy the game and will keep on playing it on my free time. As a free player you still can do a lot and overall I think the F2P part of the game is very very good, just don't expect to be the no. 1 player without spending some money.			"

TL;DR = All you need to do is look at the complete list of DLC and the prices and it will tell you all you need to know about this game.Although somewhat entertaining at first, soon becomes a repetitive grind and not much more to offer unless you're willing to shell out big bucks for ""episodes"" which are nothing more than ""mini expansions"", each adding a few hours of content. If you're a DC Universe fan, you may be tempted because it's ""exclusive"" as an MMO- and I'd say go ahead and try it (after all, the base game is free) but be very cautious about dropping money into it.My advice? If you're going to spend money on this game, treat it like you're gambling- only spend what you can afford to lose. Then you may not end up with buyer's remorse later.			"

												A few years ago in the town of Middlebury Oregon, there was a man named Joseph Woodstock. He liked to be called Joey. He was a nice fellow, with a few close friends. The local ladies who saw him sometimes bowling at the local Bowl-o-Rama Bowling Alley said he was pleasant on the eyes. He was a nice guy to be around, and a very pleasant conversationalist. He knew all the right things to say, and never seemed to be on anyone's bad side. He never had a run in the with local police, and was very straight and narrow. He owned an auto parts store in town. the shop being one of only 2 auto places in town was profitable, leaving Joey to skip the 9 to 5 grind, and have plenty of free time to pursue more leisurly activities. Joey was American as apple pie, and loving life to the fullest. He did have a girlfriend, whom he had even asked to marry him recently. She gladly accepted. Joey's life seemed set. Joey was a good wholesome average man, with lots to live for. Which is why none of the rest of this makes sense...On the night of September 14th, 2012, Joey was last seen sitting outside of his 2 story home, on his steps. A neighbor recalls seeing Joey through her window across the street. Joey appeared to be shaking, wearing only what appeared to be a towel, shorts (possibly boxers), and no shoes on. He looked a mess. The neighbor went downstairs, and when she went out of her door to see if Joey was okay, he was gone. She went to his front door and rang the doorbell, but there was no answer. 2 days later, Joey's body was found outside of town washed up in a riverbed. Police say there was no signs of foul play, and it appeared that he had commited suicide by jumping off a bridge located further upstream, breaking his neck on impact. None of this made sense. This man, whom was recently engaged and not in any trouble financially or otherwise, took his own life? This made no sense at all.Police searched his home and found no evidence of foul play. When they searched his den, the lights were flickering off and on, with a faint humming coming from a computer fan. The computer had been left on. Maybe there were clues here? One officer walked up to the computer desk, and touched the mouse enough to get the computer out of sleep mode. what he saw haunted him. A few seconds later, the computer monitor sparked, and then it shut off. It had died. As well as the computer with it. Haunted by what he had seen, officer Henry King mentioned none of this to other officers, and left what he had seen on the screen out of his report. 4 days later, Henry King was found dead in his apartment. He had hung himself the night before. On his computer monitor it flickered off and on. DC Universe™ Online Free-To-Play. Your Way®. Scribbled on a notepad also on his desk, in almost illegible hand writing was a small message: ""Abandon all hope ye who enter here""			"

												Would not recommend this game by far 7200 hours on this game in 4 years ( toooo much time ).  The bad out weighs  the good seeing how the good is slowing being destroyed by a money ran dev team. The Good: Movement options are great since they give you various options to gank/ enter battles. Acro was my got to for everything but tanking since the skills you can learn weren't meant for it unless you want to power single target pulls; to it's credit the super move is good for tanking. Flight is a cheap way to find collectables and beat everyone not experienced in superspeed and superspeed is good for speedruns with experience. The combat is superb, 3rd person perspective getting the chance to admire your nude cowboy Rage Dps while they chain whip things. Controls were meant for a controller considering a port from the PS, If your gonna use keyboard make sure you know it because 1-+ will be used on a norm at fast paces considering your dlc ownership. Character creation is good, not great because you need dlcs to make your character truely have options. You can Lock your suit in if you like your starter character or change it while your not in combat anywhere in game.The Bad:The company wants your money period JENS said it on a stream, since Amazon Fury came out the content is now noticeably reused and called new. Dlc is $10 and can only be used with cash and they made being a member damn near needed since free players have limited broker usage, have a 1.5k spending limit and can't trade (haven't stayed free long enough to get all the info). Premium players 14 extra Inventory slots-12 extra Bank slots-4 extra Character slots-Ability to Trade Items with other players-$2k spending limit-Proximity chat-Vault access every 3 day. This game has the ftp model try before you buy, Soe doesn't want server space being used for non-paying customers, if i was wrong they wouldn't have the ridiculous limitations on this game. Community: if your lucky you'll find friends to carry you being anything but legendary. Premiums get a pass only if you have participating dlcs. Pvp is a travesty of High lvls/Cr pounding lowbies, being a new player you won't have the experience to tackle the cr/stat challenge. High skilled/ can strip all their gear off and beat a rush to t6 pvp players everyone else is just roaches waiting to be squashed. The amount of MMOOK spam in chat is f*cked up, ignoring them is a option but they're like a Horrible Joke, once you think they're gone; they're back again (MMOOK is a spam site trying to trade ingame cash for real cash). Ask yourself, is the game worth spending money on? The necessary $5 to spend to avoid FTP could be put somewhere else,something more constructive (buying an animal would be more constructive than DCUO). By next year, they will re-release content for full price with ""incentives"" because they won't need to create anything new/;the dedicated players/new players will eat it up with all the nerfs and rehashed crap.

This game involves intense combat and competitive gameplay. It is a free roam Pve/Pvp     game with collecting and fighting.

												DC universe online is for DC fans in my general opinion. I love this game myself and i have played for years on the Playstation 4 but ow i have a pc too. This game involves intense combat and competitive gameplay. It is a free roam Pve/Pvp     game with collecting and fighting.

												I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game. I think the storyline is great, and the graphics and characters are true to the comics. Being a huge DC fan, I thought it was fantastic, and I'm not really a MMORPG fan neither, although this game is an exception. One drawback is the DLC is expensive and once the main game has fulfilled you, it will become more and more costly to continue playing. Overall, I would say it's a 8/10.			"

												I use to play this game on PS3 then ps4 for a few years. And the game was great. Then Free to play came, not to bad, more people to play with. But then you have a lot people start complaining about mechanics. This game shows what happens when developers listen to people who want everything to be easy, it breaks the game. It came to the point where you can run in groups without needing specific roles, making those roles more rare.Started the game on the hero side, there is a lot of players there making it unbalanced. There is also a lot of toxic people there so I switch over to the villain side. Villains believe it or not is actually a much friendlier and helpful side. Only down side is there is a lake of people there.Pros: Great if you are into comics or want to learn about them. I started with basic knowledge but this game really expands my knowledge on many characters, and it was great fighting along side them.Movements in the game is extremely different and fun. Having the ablilty to fly is just amazing, and you can go afk without worrying about anything attacking you.Switching between PvE and PvP is very nice. Especially when levelingCombat is very nice and fast pace. There's no GCD and auto attacks. You weave weapon attacks with power attacks and blocking; giveing you unique battling.Cons:They rushed the game now. When I first started, 30 being max level took me about a month to get there. Now you can do it in about a day. Yes most of the content is end game content but the leveling part is so that you can learn your role and powers. You'll tend to see a lot of people running content and don't know how to play their role correctly.Hard content doesn't really mean learning mechanics and counter it, it's more along the line of they have stupid amount of health and damage, just spend 20 minutes punching each other in the face. Other mmos usually have mechanics and phases.Useless roles. Now they aren't exactly useless but there are many times where people would run with more dps then a controller. Controllers are used to give power back to the party but they made weapon mastery which gave the user back their own power so they can be self sufficient.Change Duty Finder. They changed the way duty finder works by allowing a party to have any composition.  When usually it would be one healer, one dps, one controller and one tank. Now you can have any combination which generally means you'll have all dps. The group will be buffed with the skill of the missing role. eg: You'll get power back when you run low if there's no controller or Tanks will heal when blocking if there is no healer. If you were a healer, I've been ask multiple times to switch to dps since there is no controller to restore my power, so I can't keep heals up.No level sync. This is usually an annoying thing to be capped but this game makes me understand why. A max dps can run any lower dungeon by themselves (which makes you feel so powerful) but for the people looking to do it for the first time, usually they would be left behind and lost while the dps just one shot the boss and takes everything and leaves. Or worse, when leveling an alt, I was kicked out of the dungeon because these max geared friends says they can do it themselves and kicked everyone else out. Waiting in a 30 minute queue to have to requeue.			"

												I won't say this is the best game ever, it isn't. I mean, it's pretty fun, i enjoy the gameplay, the story, the costumization. It is a shame that it is basically P2W and DLC based. In August players had the chance to play episodes they didn't buy, which was pretty cool. If you don't buy the DLCs you're pretty much stuck in the same missions over and over again. I never bought a DLC or anything in this game, never spent a dime on DCUO but I am considering spending just a bit from time to time to get access to my escrow cash. Even with all this cons (P2W and many many DLCs) I still enjoy the game and will keep on playing it on my free time. As a free player you still can do a lot and overall I think the F2P part of the game is very very good, just don't expect to be the no. 1 player without spending some money.			"

TL;DR = All you need to do is look at the complete list of DLC and the prices and it will tell you all you need to know about this game.Although somewhat entertaining at first, soon becomes a repetitive grind and not much more to offer unless you're willing to shell out big bucks for ""episodes"" which are nothing more than ""mini expansions"", each adding a few hours of content. If you're a DC Universe fan, you may be tempted because it's ""exclusive"" as an MMO- and I'd say go ahead and try it (after all, the base game is free) but be very cautious about dropping money into it.My advice? If you're going to spend money on this game, treat it like you're gambling- only spend what you can afford to lose. Then you may not end up with buyer's remorse later.			"

												With more content than you can shake a batarang at, DC Universe is one of the best Free to Play MMO's out there. Unlike other f2p mmos, it doesnt restrict playable content you can access. Instead, they have several playable Power classes available for free, along with more you can unlock for a relatively cheap price. And if you subscribe for a month to make your characters with those power classes, you get to keep them when your sub runs out. In short, theres a ton to do even if you only play the free model, but theres still something for you to do if you want to buy a little more.			"

												A few years ago in the town of Middlebury Oregon, there was a man named Joseph Woodstock. He liked to be called Joey. He was a nice fellow, with a few close friends. The local ladies who saw him sometimes bowling at the local Bowl-o-Rama Bowling Alley said he was pleasant on the eyes. He was a nice guy to be around, and a very pleasant conversationalist. He knew all the right things to say, and never seemed to be on anyone's bad side. He never had a run in the with local police, and was very straight and narrow. He owned an auto parts store in town. the shop being one of only 2 auto places in town was profitable, leaving Joey to skip the 9 to 5 grind, and have plenty of free time to pursue more leisurly activities. Joey was American as apple pie, and loving life to the fullest. He did have a girlfriend, whom he had even asked to marry him recently. She gladly accepted. Joey's life seemed set. Joey was a good wholesome average man, with lots to live for. Which is why none of the rest of this makes sense...On the night of September 14th, 2012, Joey was last seen sitting outside of his 2 story home, on his steps. A neighbor recalls seeing Joey through her window across the street. Joey appeared to be shaking, wearing only what appeared to be a towel, shorts (possibly boxers), and no shoes on. He looked a mess. The neighbor went downstairs, and when she went out of her door to see if Joey was okay, he was gone. She went to his front door and rang the doorbell, but there was no answer. 2 days later, Joey's body was found outside of town washed up in a riverbed. Police say there was no signs of foul play, and it appeared that he had commited suicide by jumping off a bridge located further upstream, breaking his neck on impact. None of this made sense. This man, whom was recently engaged and not in any trouble financially or otherwise, took his own life? This made no sense at all.Police searched his home and found no evidence of foul play. When they searched his den, the lights were flickering off and on, with a faint humming coming from a computer fan. The computer had been left on. Maybe there were clues here? One officer walked up to the computer desk, and touched the mouse enough to get the computer out of sleep mode. what he saw haunted him. A few seconds later, the computer monitor sparked, and then it shut off. It had died. As well as the computer with it. Haunted by what he had seen, officer Henry King mentioned none of this to other officers, and left what he had seen on the screen out of his report. 4 days later, Henry King was found dead in his apartment. He had hung himself the night before. On his computer monitor it flickered off and on. DC Universe™ Online Free-To-Play. Your Way®. Scribbled on a notepad also on his desk, in almost illegible hand writing was a small message: ""Abandon all hope ye who enter here""			"

												It's got a fairly decent combat system, but the limited power & character customisation combined with the fact that the Villians and Heros have basically the same quests with different voice-overs means that any attempt at a second playthrough will get real stale real fast.My advice: Make one character, play them to max level, then make 5 more characters for each Origin/Side combo you didn't pick and do their starter mission arcs, as these are the only arcs that are really all that unique.

												This may be the perfect game for you!If you like:- Unskippable voice acting cutscenes in 2014 (BOOSTER, STFU - it was funny the first 10 times),- Clearly-designed-for-console games on PC that still feel like console games,- Crafting material collection game mechanics that allows other players to steal your drops (this is 100% true),- An ingame community who use words that would make CoD multiplay gamers blush,- Badly written storylines in which DC characters will act out of character (these are pretty rare though),- DLC which consists mostly of game areas which can only be accessed by teams, and 'new power types' which are clearly mostly reskins/cookie-cutter-trash.- Did I mention the utterly crappy crafting material collection mechanic, which allows other players to steal your drops?,- Decent voice acting (seriously, it's mostly pretty good - even if you can't skip some of it),- Skill/power trees with so much planned redundancy that it would make a 90s game shake its head in pity,- An endgame that is so grindy that it would make most Korean game companies shake their head in disgust,- And also if I haven't mentioned it yet, the extremely poorly designed crafting material collection mechanics?- Getting a stipend when you sub - but only if you got to the DCUO website and collect it. NOWHERE was this explained.- if you liked Champions Online, but thought it was way too complicated, then this may just be the game for you.I spent just over 600 hours in-game. I must have spent at least 1/4-5 of those trying to collect crafting mats.  Over the space of a few years, obviously - every 4-5 play sessions, I would stupidly dedicate to trying to collect crafting mats, and then get angry and quit the game for weeks, then start the whole cycle all over again upon my return. Did I mention how devoid of logic and fairness that the crafting material collection mechanics are? I cannot stress this enough - it makes Elder Scrolls Online look like a hippie commune in comparison. Oh, it's okay because you can buy something for real money that will show you where they are. But this STILL doesn't protect you from having your mats interfered with by other players, so why bother?You go up to the thing, and press 'Use'. If anyone else comes up after you, they can interrupt your gathering attempt, and start their own. And then you interrupt theirs. Whoever had the best internet connection will win. So, whoever lives the closest to a city in real life will win. This would be acceptable on a PvP server. This is not acceptable, in 2014, on a PvE server. Maybe they've changed it since. I don't care. I fail to see how that magically returns the many hours I wasted trying to get crafting materials.Free-To-Play, MY way? No. Not even remotely.MY way would have asynchronous crafting mat collection, or would make it so that whoever was first there would get the drop.Why am I going on about this? Because this is one of those games where you can't do the end-content unless you get the kick*** gear (I don't mean it's harder without it, I mean that it won't let you click on the mission to start it) , and you can't get the kick*** gear without crafting, or buying for an extremely unreasonable price on the market. Let me make this clear - the crafting mats collection mechanics could, in all likelihood, STOP you from accessing content that you've PAID REAL LIFE MONEY FOR. It sure did in my case.Free-To-Play, MY way? No. Nope. Not even close. What a joke.So why am I STILL recommending this game, even though I clearly hate it and everything about it?PURELY because it basically ignores the whole New52 thing.Some of the characters might act in ways that don't make sense (Robin is an idiot in this game, even if his voice acting is great) - but at least the Joker has an actual face, and Supermans costume doesn't look like a set of longjohns with a fannypack.In conclusion, this is the easily greatest singleplayer superhero game never made.

												I played this a lot on the playstation and computer. I have way more hours than what steam suggests. However; I did not enjoy the game anymore a couple years back. Coming back I expected the same old introduction, and tired ♥♥♥ quests, that I had already completed. Instead, they acknowledged the age of the game and told a story of the humans failure. They also made it to where as long as you tag a enemy or objective, you will get it, so first hitting mobs doesn't matter as the quests are completed with area based people. The playerbase does a fairly good job in low levels to prevent people from farming lowbies. A lot of people seem to have an issue with daybreak, but I find them to be great, and very helpful. This is a free to play game, but those who complain are the same people who do not support the game. This is a company and they need funding to continue gaming. Not too mention, I also played Planetside 2 as well. Daybreak has a 5 game pass for the price of one mmo. Now I hate Everquest, EQ 2 and Landmark. However; I suggest you play until level 30, if you do decide prior to that to subscribe great...but once you reach 30 on your main, I would suggest obtaining the benefits of a subscription if you are able to afford it. The story feels fresh again, although the quests are the same until you get to newer content. The graphics have been polished fairly well, and the gameplay is still one of the best out there.  If you are thinking about playing it for the first time, I would suggest doing so until at least level 30, so you can finish the first storyline. It is ftp afterall and the not having the benefits is not going to cripple you early. You can farm a lot for the gear and items you need and/or want. However; the subscription is a convenience, it is not required, but once you start grinding for gear to PVP or whatever you enjoy, it will take you longer.			"

												★★☆☆☆This barely DC themed MMO plays like a bad console port, which is epsecially strange for an MMO.+ Once collected, you can freely change between equipments to customize the look of your costume+- Cool intro cinematic, too bad its nothing like the actual game+- Weird weapon/power combos.  Dual wield pistols, with ice powers, and flight.- Unresponsive controls- Standard MMO ""kill 10 bear"" quests- Menus are designed for controller use- SoE soldout to Daybreak after H1Z1 scams- FPS drops, Audio stuttering, Connectivity issues- Pay2fun, too much of this game is locked behind paywalls- Weird combo based combat, tap LMB twice, then hold it, meh- Doesn't feel like a superhero game, no less a DC specific one- Default running animation, reminds me of Adam West's Batman- After some sort of server-merge, my character's name was ruined- The settings button in the launcher brings up an infinite crash loop in .net- Very few graphic options, No borderless window option, Vsync caps the game at 30 FPS- Default character customization is almost pointless, as equipment changes your costume- Weird loadout system, which gives your powers different modifiers, as you change minor roles- Weak DC theme, there are occasionally misisons where you team up with DC heroes, but they are few and far between.

Yes there can be grinding, and yes you are limited by free to play. Premium is a little better which I am now, owning only a few DLC's  packs, styles etc. Then there is Membership which has its perks, and is nice, but in my opinion not needed for fun. I bounce from premium, to member on and off, depending on how much time i wanna put in that particular month. If you are free to play you only get two character slots, but you can delete, and make new characters if you are into going a different path with a character. Premium you get six slots which is better, and of course membership you get more. Either way its a fun game, and I recommend especially if you are big DC Comic fan such as myself.			"

												Downloading the game through Steam - 8 hours of my time.Installing game through Daybreak - 2 hours of my time.Making an account with Daybreak - 1 minute of my time.Verifying my account through email even though I am playing through Steam - 15 seconds of my time.Immediately uninstalling the game when I see that free players have to wait for 30 minutes in the queue before ever playing a second of the game - priceless.

												I stopped playing this a few months ago, would like to get back into it but the load times and updates are too bothersome.  That and the gameplay has become repetitive.  If I found out there was a fun event that I could do or more involving stories that aren't just fetch and kill quests I might take a look at it again.			"

												This game is a brilliant MMO-RPG.Not like Marvel Heroes you can make your own hero or villain.You can help Superman or Lex Luthor.It's your choice to help who, if you love batman,joker,superman,lex luthor,green lantern.sinestro and many more you will love this game.It's free to play and the updates come out weekly.Every special event like Christmas or Easter DC Universe online makes the game look like Christmas and Easter.Well i don't know what else to say but to day it is a brilliant game and   should be played by more people and many you can even play it.there are some bugs but they get fixed so quick!Scarhevy23              9/10 Great game			"

												This game is terrible, and I would advise everyone to stay away and not invest their time or money into this game. The game has been broken ever since release with no attempt to fix the bugs/glitches or even ban the hackers than run speed hacks. It's more about how much money they can get from you by releasing repetitive and rehashed content and passing it off as new. Selling replay badges and booster bundles and other useless junk instead of fixing the game. They constantly add things to the marketplace and yet can't find the time to fix PVP or PVE content. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!			"

												Let me save you some time. It's dull, and you are are severely handicapped not just content wise but power and money wise without a subscription. The combat is meh, most of the abilities don't really have that wow factor or that oomph feeling that everyone in other MMO's have a few of. Combat is largely just left-and right click mouse combos and a few abilities peppered in. The character creation is neat but has a lot more room for improvement - half the characters you see will have the same serious personality and stand like they have a stick up their butt. Some powers and weapons are limited by purchasing specific content or having a subscription, which I get, but POWER RINGS LOCKED? REALLY? NO GREEN LANTERN FOR YOU! And I know its game but if you want some degree of immersion in the universe, hope you don't mind all the generic MMO try-too-hard names your comrades will have - superman289, Batlord, XSupermangX sure don't seem to mind.The equivalent of dungeons are also extremely boring. While it was nice that they varied in group size, the ones I did needed zero communication at all - people round and punch stuff or hold E for a second.If you want to play as a villian hope you have a few friends who want to do it with you - for every 1 villian there seems to be about 5-10 heroes. I can't even recall one time villians won one of the nearby pvp events.The mentoring concept (in which what hero or villian you chose to teach you) could have been amazing - but instead it just changes the missions/quests you do while leveling. You could be reporting and fighting with batman, or being taught the tricks of the trade by Lex Luthor but NOOOOOOOPE go out into the city and do random stuff while I occaisonally talk on the radio.I will give it one high mark though - the styles tab. It keeps track of every style of gear piece you have looted and allows you to display that item instead of the one equipped without having to equip it. The best part is you can do it anytime even if you no longer own the items, and you can even lock the style so it never changes until you tell it to. IT IS GENIUS! I've seen other games do things similar, but usually, you still have to own the item, or if you equip a new piece over it you have to talk to someone to revisiualize it. It's like transmogging from WoW but without the lost bank space and gold cost.Overall it's dissapointing: The core concept of Thousands of people suddenly being given powers and becoming heroes of villians and why it happened, was good. The idea for a mentor was great. The idea that you get to create your own person and interact with villians and heroes in the DC universe? GOOOOOOOOOOOD.The problem is the execution is horrible. They tried to combine Arkham games combat with generic mmo combat, and the end result is neither part works well or feels fun. The character creation is a little too restrictive and having all the players in one region on one server results in crappy named characters (not even happy with my own for once) and missions contained in one small spot trying to be finished by 10-30 people. Fighting often feels slow and floaty. Many concepts such as the mentors and the hideouts/bases largely fall flat, and you may find yourself feeling that the way they implemented them was unnecessary. It took so many negative or meh things other mmo's did, and tried mixing it in with one or two good ideas.At the end of the day it's not worth it to me to invest any more time, or any money, into this game. It feels like one long slog where you don't feel any sense of achievement, the combat lacks impact and excitement, and the controls are kinda goofy at times. If you love DC comics or the stuff that comes out of them you might want to at least try it and form your own opinion - after all there is a free play model. But if you're just looking for an online game there are plenty out there better. If you're looking for a good DC game try the Batman Arkham games, or Injustice: Gods Among Us. "

												This is an utterly addictive game for a fan of DC Comics. I'm uncertain how non-fans might feel, but as a fangirl, I've really enjoyed playing in the world I've read about for so many years. I'm using a free account, which means I've been bumping up against the paywall, but despite the limitations, the game is still playable, just more challenging (which is a plus). The positives are many: Lots of in-jokes, winks, and nods for the long-time fans to enjoy. The game itself is fun, allowing you to create superhero characters with a good variety of powers. Leveling up through the first 30 levels is guided by missions that you must complete to advance to the next mission. Each one provides new challenges for learning your skills and powers. Once you reach level 30, the real game starts with a variety of daily missions available and plenty of different possible paths, from player-vs-player to group co-op play and even quite a few single player adventures. As a person who enjoys single player, I found the gameplay immersive and fun... although playing some scenarios solo is definitely a challenge. You learn how to draw enemies away from the crowd to take them on singly. This is definitely a game to play with a group. The adventures in which I've teamed up with others have been extremely fun.The negatives are mostly due to playing on a free account. Free accounts cannot sell items on the broker, have limited inventory and banking space, and the cash limit really makes it difficult to buy really nice gear. However, these are all challenges and working around them can actually make the game more fun. Although, considering the amount of time I've already put into the game and how much I enjoy it, I suspect I will eventually pay for an account.Other negatives: The game is prone to freezing and crashing, but luckily it happens rarely. I'm sure part of it is due to my lack of a proper gaming computer. Like any Massive Multiplaying Online game, there are downtimes. In fact, I'm writing this in a downtime, since I'd scheduled some time to play and the game is offline. For a complete newbie, the controls are not obvious and there are no simple guides to show people how to move and hit. Yeah, I bumped my first opponent a lot until I figured out how to use the keyboard and mouse together.In short, the positives outweigh the negatives for the most part. If you are a fan of DC Comics, this is definitely a game to try.			"

												DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!! I play this game when it first came out on ps3, than ps4 and i play on pc as well but pc crowd isn't very friendly and its hard to get a party going being that you are too noob and your gears aren't as high as theirs.. All you do is the same raids over and over again just to get some gears that will last til next DLC. The free version is more like a tutorial, once you hit level 30 you will get some low raids that now body plays any more and you can't even find a group. Now to play with most people who are already max out in gears and stats you  have to pay for DLC's, Seriously this game is all about DLC or you pay the montyly premium of 15 bucks and you are still stuck do one raid weekly per quest or dungeon like. And if you are not gear up, people won't even do those top raids with you. They should lower their monthly fee to 5 bucks a month and i bet more people will play this game. MY HONEST REVIEW WOULD BE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME TO DO SAME THING OVER N OVER N OVER N OVER AGAIN JUST TO GET A PIECE OF GEAR			"

												When DC announced the marriage of DC Universe Online, I think every single nerd on the planet immediately said to themselves, ""This can go one of two ways; pretty damned awesome or the most excruciating experience invented since the bikini wax.""  And lo and behold, we met the second most painful item to hit mankind.  Originally, the developing company hyped up the game, promising everything from customizable player housing, villian and hero PvP that would be well-balanced and enjoyable, as well as a relentless assault on the typical flavor of the week scenarios and power upgrades.  They promised scenarios and power types that have actually existed in the DC comic genre.  Out of all of their promises, they've fulfilled two.  In a ratio based item, that's 2:45.In general, that's bad business.  When they discovered that they were unable to or were expected to keep their promises, they quickly went the route of the current MMO genre; free to play.  Since then, the game has constantly had ill-repairs, downtime, unmet promises, and very, very low expectations.  It is just one step above Champions Online, save for the strange Mortal Combat type figurations for certain attack moves (down, down-right, right anyone?).  DC Universe actually has a storyline, which is impressive given its current state of affairs in-game.  Character customization is lacking.  The developing company (mainly their PR branch) continues to promise amazing new feats, outfits, and customization that will resurrect its game in a manner that would put an unnamed fellow from 2000 some years ago to shame.  Unfortunately, thus far, they've only been able to resurrect a continual decline in player data-base, as well as overall effectiveness.However, they still offer a plate of cookies and a strangely colored kool-aid.

												Being released a few years ago does nothing to deminish the value DCUO has to offer, no matter how you look at it DCUO brough somthing new to the mmo table, and now with the closure of other super hero beatem up mmos you might think that the genre is dying but DCUO still stands strong with a wealth of content and even more being released regularly! DCUO offers a great story for a fan of DC comics or comics in general but, dont be put off if you dont know your lore, the DCU is part of a larger dc multiverse and is a great place to start learning whether your a hard core fan of comics, or you just want to ""test the water"" so to speak DCUO has somthing for all types of players I recomend you give it a try.        10/14/13			"

												Honestly, this game is a ceespool.I don't think that I can describe with words the amount of braindeadness that you have to be in order to play this piece of garbage. This game offers NOTHING unique, the ""twist"" that you have heros instead of RPG characters might aswell make it worse because nobody is special in this game. The so called ""lore"" isn't even of the game but the comics so not much of a thought has been dedicated to this game. You get to choose between the evil and the good, pretty generic for an MMORPG, with the basic classes unlocked which are total horse-♥♥♥♥ and the good ones locked which only proves my point about how much of an abomination this game is. So, let's say you're digging this game and want to unlock a character that costs money. Guess what? ♥♥♥♥ you! You can't get paid items by playing the game, making this game a worse pay to win than the others on the market. Graphics are pretty bad from what I remember and the game is generally just a generic ""MMORPG"" which features nothing new or innovative. If you like the DC series and heros, sure, you might have a few fun hours of actually seeing new stuff, but theres nothing else than grinding for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ items and combat ratings that you do in this game. LITERALLY the only thing you do in this game is grind for ♥♥♥♥♥♥ items to level up, you have to be a ♥♥♥♥ing dumb ♥♥♥♥ in order to actually have fun while playing this game, or a 5 year old.So why am I writing this review? Don't I have better stuff to do? Yeah, but this review isn't for me. See, theres this guy I won't mention his name which plays this game for a living, only that he doesn't get any money for it or anything beneficial really, only wasting his time playing this game. A thousand hours? More... Two thousand? A bit more... Between three and four thousand? That a boy! I hope that you can see my concernes regarding his health, if one of the developers reads this, please ban him and me from the game so I won't have to see this for my entire life again.2/10 at most.

												Absolute unquestionable trash. It's hard to see how any game could go this far attempting to ape City of Heroes and fall so far. It doesn't help that it's a DC property, removing the ability to have most of the interesting superhero properties out there.DC Universe is a terrible game and a waste of the 0 dollars you will spend on it.

												I have been playing this game on and off for about 4 years, on ps3 ps4 and pc and i can say without a doubt its one of the best free MMO's out there. not only is it set in the badass world of DC but the character customization is beyond anything any mmo has out there!The combat is brilliant, the stories are really well done, the voice acting is insanely good!The rewards are rewarding, the boss fights are an actual challenge, the re-playability of this game is like next level ♥♥♥♥!The end game stuff is amazing if you are into raids and multiplayer goal orientated games.Overall it is an amazing game!i just really wish that marvel would make a game exactly like this in their universe, and get rid of that god awful marvel heroes!

												I can't support this game.. It seems like it is made up of nothing but narcissistic elitists who think they're too good to help out lower level players. Aside from that, many of the instances glitch out, and it's almost like this game is nearly play to win. I seriously can't believe I wasted money on this.For those that actually do play this game, if you see a user named lHyper Noval (Power: Sorcery), ignore and report him. He had me kicked me from a raid when I just decided to ""rest"" while waiting for another user to go to the area where we were. I was actually doing my part and not idling, or starting any trouble. I was the second stongest of the raid after him, with users that were MUCH lower than the both of us and not in the same league as him. He had no reason to do this other than to just be spiteful. That was basically the final straw.			"

												It honestly boggles my mind why people who have spent the past decade playing WoW for 15 bucks a month can't throw a smaller and much more deserving video game company a few bucks here and there.  Especially when that company has gone F2P.How do you people think content is even added into the game?  Do you think a room full of Dev's are going to care that you're playing their game?  No, they need actual support through funding.  Just as you expect a paycheck from your jobs, so do these amazing people who work their asses off just so you can all sit on yours.			"

												DC Universe Online, a free mmorpg. On my steam record I have not played to much, but have completed it on my PS4 system. The game like many mmo's has you make your own charcater, chose a power, etc. The game has nice unique features to make you stand out if you chose. You can chose a superhero mentor, Superman, Batman, or Wonderwoman, who each specify in one unique kind of fighting style. For vilians mentors include, Lex Luthor, The Joker, and Circe. I finished my game as a superhero under the help of Batman. I found myself traviling from Metropilis to Gothem completing missions. Throught 2/3's of the game it is tedious and gets increasingly more difficult. Although ranking up and getting more powers, the game has a very short stop. I probably put a couple of hours, either with my friends assitance or not. Like many mmo's once again, you can of course pay dlc to unlock more missions and or superpowers for your charcter to master! I leval cap'd in this game way to easily. If you wish to stay with your free account, like I did, you can make two charcters! Seems better than only one, until you realize, the storyline is the same, with or without friends or groups, you just switch your roles going through the same jobs! Overall this game only recives a 6/10 for its shortness and paywalls. I'd recommend this if your looking for a nice short game on your computer or Sony Console. Because while it did last, it was a load of fun!			"

												I believe this is a highly underrated game. While I haven't played in years, I know you can not pay a dime, while not being able to play any endgame, there is much fun to be had.For me, I mostly enjoyed my knowledge of heroes and villains in the DC universe increasing 100 fold.  From the big ones to the small, there are so many encounters, either talking or fighting to be had.It's beat to approach this not as mmo, but an rpg.  Bring a friend or 3 and do the many 4 man instances or 2 man ones.  Even alone groups can be found and there is much lore to dive into.You get many customization options from powers to weapons.  So any power can be combined with any weapons giving you so many choices of specs. While your power stays the same, weapons can be changed very often.The minimal abilities is great as well. Most mmos give you 2 to 3 dozen buttons to push, where you have about 7 here.If you're a super hero, comic, or DC fan you have nothing to lose by checking out this free game.If you're looking for an mmo to dive into hardcore, you need to spend money and you're probably better off playing a newer mmo.

												SO GOD DAMN BORINGThe game has amazing potential but it's just being held back by so many issues. One of the main issues is that it hides behind this idea of being f2p. It's not. A large majority of the content is locked unless you pay, so you could play it for free, but youre not experiencing a huge chunk of the game.The other issues mostly stem from how repetitive the games quests can get, and how mundane some of the tasks assigned to you can be.The game also just looks incredibly outdated and feels so awkward to control, especially with the super speed ability, as the camera can jitter and clip with walls and the whole thing is just a ♥♥♥♥ show. It's an amazing concept, play an MMO, be a super hero/villain, be mentored by your favourite heroes/villains, but the execution is just so poor, that I could not find myself once thinking ""I'm having a good time playing this game, and I'd like to continue playing it"".

												For the record, if this wasn't free to play, or if Champions Online was (for real, though, it's not really free), I wouldn't recommend it. Just saying.DC Universe Online is one of the best superhero MMOs. It's better than anything Marvel has done in the MMO field. It's at least on par with Champions Online (I don't like CO, but some do, and I've not played it much). I'd even say it's one of the better superhero games ever made. Even so, it's still only mediocre.Don't mistake me. The first few hours are fun, and just running/climbing/flying through the city is a lot of fun. The character customization options are limited, but passable. The abilty trees are interesting, but you're gonna want to pick a path you like pretty early on, or risk getting stuck at the difficulty curve right about level 16 and being stuck with your current abilities for a while until you finally get leveling again.That difficulty curve around levels 15-19 is obnoxious, and convinced me to stop plpaying. If I have put in more money than $10 for a DLC pack, I would have been more committed, but since it was largely a free experience, there was no investment to redeem. Again, the game being free made it worth it, and the ability to play the entire game, unrestricted, free of charge makes this far more worth your time and money than Champions Online in my book.

												Intro free to play , then PAY TO PLAY the rest of the way. This is the death of all MMO's as of late. Money schemes. Also, REPLAY BADGES, another way to screw your subscribers over even more! Lets make them use replay badges so after they use them up regardless if you subscribe or not youstill have to buy more. Way to go!			"

												Here is the TRUTH OK, this game is bad. I am talking, Superman 64, Aquaman 64 , E.T. bad. The only single redeeming ""quality"" is the top notch voice acting. And that's only good thing about this game. This game belongs , in the very same place they dug up those E.T. cartridges in desert. This game should have never, been conceived period. As a matter of fact , this game gives anything DC Comics related? A permanent ""black eye"" this also explains why the new 52 came and went, and ultimately failed. I wouldn't wish this game , on my worst enemy? Check that, actually I would. The worst thing is that you could ever do, is download and play this game. It's a complete and utter , waste of time. And that's the TRUTH!			"

Second of all, level caps are not a good idea for a free to play game, especially at level 30.Third of all, this game has so much potential.Daybreak, if you want to make money so badly, fix the bugs and things that the players don't want. Yes, keep a membership system, yes, keep bringing out new Episodes. But please, remove the level caps and all of the other things that most players don't want.

												I've played this game for years on ps3 and ps4 and recently decided to start playing again. To be honest, while it isn't a bad game it can feel grindy like any MMO, so i strongly suggest playing this game with friends or else your experience might suck due to the fact that Matchmaking isn't skill based, and friends usually make most things enjoyable.TLDR; Good game, great customization options, grindy as hell like any MMO, Don't buy DLC but do legendery if you can afford it, and the game really doesn't start until level 30, and find friends Pros.Combat is fun, you use your weapon combos mostly BUT, you focus on your powers if you know how to manage a mana bar-Lots of customizable options, make your hero/villain look as badass or as goofy as you want   -While you can't play as your favorite iconics  in the open world, you can make them look close, or    better-Easy to get into -Story is well written and voice acting is on point.-Seasonal events, Instances and raids to keep you busy-You can play as your favorite heroes and villains** but only in a few ""Instances"" and pvpCons.-On top of grinding missions, you have to grind for skill points too which you use for your weapon combos and passive stat upgrades  - On top of this, if you're in the higher level raids and instances, it's pretty much expected for you to have a good number of skill points which can lead to being kicked. This can be avoided if you get a good League (guild) or just play with friends-Paying can be annoying as hell if you haven't played MMOs like WoW, even then the free to play aspect of this game sucks except as an introductory stage since the game doesn't really start untill level 30 .    -It's around 15$ usd a month for Legendary which gives you access to all DLC, your money isn't limited (the most you can have with a free to play is 1,500. For comparison, there are items in the marketplace that go for millions of in game cash), more inventory and bank spaces- In my opinion,  do not buy the dlcs for this game  Getting the DLC only gives you access to that specific content and Premium membership, while legendary gives you what I stated before as well as a certain in game currency the game gives you every month, that you can use for cosmetics and such.

												Ok, For the record, I have probably 600+ hours in this game on PS4. I love this game, I really do, I had subscription, 3 combat rating 100 characters and much more. But, I stopped playing PS4 and switched to PC full time, this would be all well and good if I could buy the DLC here :/ Game is amazing, granted the communitys a lot smaller than how I remember but its still a fun game. After messing around for 8 hours I decide to try get the subscription, NO PAYMENT OPTION THROUGH STEAM.Why, why is this game on steam if I can't pay through it???? I don't have a credit card, no I don't want one. I like my pre-paid steam cards, they are what I usually spend my excess money on, the tought that I am limited to payments of american credit cards when I live in the EU is.....disappointing. VERY disappointing. I am not rating this game bad because of the game, I am rating this game bead because they refuse to take the money I throw at them, GG DCUO, well played, now to uninstall.			"

												You want my honest opinion? This game is only good up until the point when you have to buy things to get more access. If you look at this game their f2p method is all wrong, they should look at Warframe and take cews from DE. This game is great but honestly you don't have to play it. I only play it for role playing reasons but if you want to do that too just play the dead game Champions Online that has a vastly superiror character customization protocol. I don't reccomend this game but I do enjoy playing it. NOTE: The PvP sucks and the only reason to play it is to get that sweet Nightwing style. PvE is my strongsuit but most people only play for PvP after they finish their PvE required missions. BTW the DLC Universe Online is hilarious. Sources: I've played since 2012			"

												This game made me unsubscribe from WoW, why? Because it was the best OpenWorld Hero/Villian-Based MMO Game ever made, but, there's a lot of things that make the game lose its bright, so let's begin:1) You can only advance up to Level 30;2) Once you complete de ""history"" mode, which ends at level 30, you may have to farm tokens to get better gear;3) Non-Premium players won't get tokens as fast as the Premium Players, so, it's literaly P2W;4) Most important instances requires DLC and the required Item Level to join it which can be raised buying better gear, so, after level 30, you'll live to raise your Item level;5) The most wanted Powers requires DLC, and DLCs are not cheap;6) Legendary Players can  have ALL DLCs for free, but they have to pay per month, same as WoW;7) Without starter ""history mode"", the game becomes repetitive, tiring and Boring;8) Unbalanced PvP, if you don't have gear be prepared to get pwned many times before buying, at least, a nice weapon;9) Open-World PvP is really annoying: you're trying to do a simple quest when the terror decends from the skies: a lot of enemy players farming your hide when least expected, Heroes, for example, are always gangbanging Low Level newbies, the best choice is raise your toon at PvE Phase;10) New Players will FOR SURE have fun with this game, mainly those who love DC Universe itself.I wish i could never write those topics, but they're the 10 reasons Why i am no more a DC Universe Online Player, the game is DAMN GOOD, but i don't like to ride in circles if you get me right, if i wanted to grind, there're a lot of games out there to be tried.

Found the gameplay fun, the fact that you can create your own hero/villain which you'd always wish you could see in a comic, in the game and have him fight crime, or fight justice with your favourite DC characters. Another reason I enjoyed playing, is the RP. DCUO has a great RP community, which you can see via DCUO RP Haven. 10/10			"

												The Good: Fun. That word is thrown around alot in this industry and to be honest this game deserves it. Grinding doesn't feel like it drags on, PVP is exciting and engaging. The game rewards players for being social. It has great graphics, sound, and story, the voice acting engages players in a way that no MMO has before.The Bad: It's difficult finding tight groups you can run with where everyone has a job and they know what they have to do. healers forget to heal, tanks don't tank, controllers think using damage role generates energy, and damage role guys are there to pick up  Investigations.Other thoughts: Why do so many people badmouth this game over lost accounts? I've seen about 20 negative reviews from people who'd rather whaaa about ""losing all their DLC"" rather than contacting Daybreak about getting their account back. Whiny maggots.			"

												Jogo simplesmente sensacional! O que posso dizer de um jogo como este, onde eu posso criar o meu próprio Super-Herói ou me inspirar nos que eu assistia e lia quando criança? Poxa, encontrei esse jogo tarde de mais eu acho, gostaria de ter o conhecido mais cedo, porque cara, que joguinho pra viciar. Os gráficos para um MMO são lindos, e os poderes que se pode ter também. As quests são em geral fáceis, mas as dungeons são muito ♥♥♥♥! Proporcionando ao jogador uma dificuldade razoável, onde várias vezes você vai morrer, até você achar o ponto fraco do inimigo e bater lá. O jogo tem um sistema de cash e premium member, ou Legendary, mas não muda em nada o gameplay, só da ao jogador vantagens de ter TODAS as DLCs do jogo de graça e a opção de criar uma Liga, e o preço do membro mensal não chega a ser tão caro, R$23,99, sendo que nos EUA são U$14,99, ou seja, estamos saindo com lucro, pois a mensalidade seria quase R$60,00. Mas enfim, não estou dizendo para você pagar mensalmente, você pode simplesmente comprar as DLCs e viver sua vida.   A busca pelo level 30 é complicada, demora bastante para você upar, tendo que fazer duas ou até mesmo 3 missões para upar metade do level, mas é assim mesmo, se você quer facilidade vai jogar Minecraft.    Enfim pessoal, jogo 100% recomendado, se você gosta do universo DC, você vai amar esse jogo, os gráficos são lindos, a jogabilidade quase que perfeita, a história é boa, e a dublagem em inglês sensacional.

												For those out of the loop, this probably represents the last of the big old-style MMOs. Even though it was only released in 2011, there’s something about it that feels more tired than Bruce Wayne’s put upon butler. Indeed, there’s a grind to almost every mission, the graphics don’t exactly sparkle (even on new hardware), and how you choose to fight seems to have very little bearing on the outcome of battle. Speedy level progression and focus on all combat, all the time might prove tedious if you're someone who enjoys exploring new worlds for the thrill of mystery and discovery. The largely instanced, repeatable endgame content is fun, but it's not inviting enough to make it worth paying a monthly fee for it. But even if it doesn't provide enough new content to sustain you beyond a couple of weeks, DC Universe Online is generally entertaining, and comic book fans will be happy that the license was handled with care.Perhaps the best gameplay feature of DCUO is the design of its default UI layout and keybinds. Instead of the standard MMOG mechanic of ""tab-target, auto-attack, fire-all-your-cooldowns-and-wait-for-refresh"" that leaves you a slave to whack-a-mole style hotbuttons and timers, DCUO maps the entirety of your primary weapon set to a single button. Through a series of ""clicks"" and ""holds,"" your avatar will execute different combinations of superpowered techniques that are the bread and butter of your life as a hero or villain. The additional powers you can use are yours to command at YOUR discretion, not the whim of a global cooldown, and you may find yourself going as long as an hour or two without needing to activate a single one. This combination of simplicity and freedom allow you to do something that has become less common in MMOGs - you can actually watch the action unfold instead of always having your eyes fixed to your hotbars. This also has allowed the DCUO devs to include clever boss fight mechanics that include a reliance on environmental awareness, since it's easier to see what's going on around you.			"

												I don't get why this game gets so much hate. Sure, it may cost you a bit to do stuff, but for those of you who play actually free games, you'll likely enjoy this. The character customization is amazing, letting you make a hero/villian from scratch, or just base it off a previous DC character. It's so cool to see your charater fight alongside well-known DC characters and other players as you're just thinking 'I just beat Bane..."" But, the game has many flaws, so I'll go over them now. First off, even with the upgraded flying and super-speed, it takes forever to get to a Police Station or a hideout. Then, there are the missions, ad boos battles, which are not that fun. The missions just require you to kill some people, then save some people. And the boss battles are even worse. The only fun part about the boss battles is that you get to fight with another DC character, one who rivals your target. So if you were fighting Circe, your teammate would be Wonder Woman. It sounds cool, but the boss fights are just use this to weaken them and then hit them over and over again. Plus, this has the MMo thing of 'I didn't make this character right, I'll have to delete him and start anew"". This can make the game pretty boring after you've made a million character because there are only 6 routes to go on, and alot of times, they'll intersect, and you'll end up doing a mission for another route. But I would still recommend this game for all the wide variety and diversity.It's good for f2p's, and for those who spend tons of money on a DC MMO. Total rating: 7/10			"

												Hands down one of the best MMORPG's I've ever played. If you love DC you will love this game. If not, you will get to know all of the heroes and villians to an extent and even come across ones you've never even seen or heard of. I have. Since this was made for the systems, it plays almost exactly like a combat game...online. The only difference is (big surprise) you get skills and powers that you need to assign to numbers. The graphics are well done, the customization of your hero/villain is in depth and unlike any other MMO I've ever played (which is quite a lot), you can customize your characters look in game and still keep the equipped gear on your character. It's fun to mix and match powers as well! Just a friendly warning to you newbies out there...if you join the PvP server you will want to watch out since you can be killed anywhere outside of buildings. If the high levels bother you too much you can go to 'The Watchtower' or 'Hall of Doom' depending on whether you make a hero or villain, and go to a 'phase shifter'. This will allow you to switch between PvP and PvE. As much as I'd love to go on and on about the game...this is already quite a review. I honestly have nothing negative to say. 10/10 -Frillin			"

I had to wade through the material they had on file and still could not find an answer to the problem. I then tried to log a ticket with Sony and the account I had just made was invaild and I was reqquired to make another avvount with Sony to log a error and ask for some help.

												You want my honest opinion? This game is only good up until the point when you have to buy things to get more access. If you look at this game their f2p method is all wrong, they should look at Warframe and take cews from DE. This game is great but honestly you don't have to play it. I only play it for role playing reasons but if you want to do that too just play the dead game Champions Online that has a vastly superiror character customization protocol. I don't reccomend this game but I do enjoy playing it. NOTE: The PvP sucks and the only reason to play it is to get that sweet Nightwing style. PvE is my strongsuit but most people only play for PvP after they finish their PvE required missions. BTW the DLC Universe Online is hilarious. Sources: I've played since 2012			"

												Too late to play the game.The Developer Team is incompetent and moneymongers,they ♥♥♥♥ed they're own game up.I've been playing for 3 years,and trust me,when i tell you that the game was good and had amazing potential,and it is in a horrible state,you should just take my word for it.

												I love this game. Me and my Father in-law play it almost every night together. It's pretty cheap to get a membership ($15 a  month but cheaper if you get for 3/6/12 months.) at first I chose to stick with 1 month at a time to see if i would like it and im hooked! I now have a 3-month reacurring membership. I have over 650 hours played among 2 characters, and thats just from February. My Father in-law has over 2000 on steam and that doesn't count before it was on steam. Yes there are a lot of DLC's but that makes it fun, there is so much content to complete. This game could be boring if you play it as a solo player. I.e not in a league or not with friends. I am in an active league with +100 members and there's always someone to talk to and make friends. Highly suggest this game, don't be put off because of the bad reviews, try it out for yourself!			"

												Do Not Play this game unless you want to be robeed by a thiefing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that goes by the name Micheal Jones.He makes you kill everything while twiddling his ♥♥♥♥ off in a corner and then steels all of your loot.This Game is a 8/10 because of Micheal Jones. Only play this game if you want unfaier rewards and a horrible experirence. THis games reward system will make you want to slash your wrists and sacrificee the blood in an unoly satanic ritual with Roilph Harris as your master. Never trust Michael Connor Jones Because he will pull your pants down when you are least expecting it and ♥♥♥♥ you in the hairy smelly ♥♥♥. This game would be a 10/10 IGN expereince if it wasnt for Pikeys like Michael Jones and the games reward system. Micheal Jones Makes you want peel your skin of to the last layer and drop yourself into a vat full of boiling salt water. He makes you want to chop a donleys ♥♥♥♥♥ and shove it down your throat. Overall this a good game but watch out for Butt♥♥♥♥ers michael Jones who will destroy your ♥♥♥♥ and rip to shreds. Take my warning and trust nobody because there are money stealing jew ♥♥♥♥♥s that play this game. Get this game it is very good but some players (Michael Jones) destroy the game.			"

												This game has an independant loader and makes it difficult to load, you have to create a seperate account then it won't run. I Kept getting a ""LaunchPad was unable to connect."" error and hen i went to the site provided by them the help was unable to assist with the problem. I had to wade through the material they had on file and still could not find an answer to the problem. I then tried to log a ticket with Sony and the account I had just made was invaild and I was reqquired to make another avvount with Sony to log a error and ask for some help. Not to self and a warning to all stay away from Sony online games. they just screw you over and waste your time. "

												Don't let my time on record fool you, I have sunk thousands of hours and dollars into this game since it launched on PS3. At one time I considered DCUO my favorite game of all time and I met some really cool people through it. The game had unlimited potential with an original combat system and the DC comics backing that had me pumped to be apart of it from the start and excited for the future. Unfortunately, over the last few years the devs have consistently made changes that have hurt the game and player base. It's obvious to me that the game is now just an ultimate cash grab for every single thing they implement. Bugs take years to get fixed unless they take money out of their pockets. New added powers come out completely overpowered so everyone pays to switch to them and then a month or so later get nerfed into the ground so you need to switch in order to stay competitive. There is zero benefit to being a player who puts a lot of money into the game. You can now pay to own powers at $5 each, but why is it that if I ""own"" the powerset on the game that I still have to pay $10 to change to the power on my hero/villain? The last straw for me was them implementing ""stat flattening"" or ""stat clamping"" whatever you/ they want to call it. I played this game to make my character stronger and feel like a growing superhero among other superheroes, not to get to a certain level and then get weaker for older content! I would love for the game to start making better steps and entice me to come back, but I fear things are just going to get worse because of the greed of the developers.			"

												I played this game because a twitch streamer i watch was playing it and has a good opinion of it but once i started playing the faults of the game quickly came to light IE: limited bag space, boxes that you can't open unless you pay for a key($2:50 per key)  that only has a one time use, powers you can't use, expansion packs you cant access. look after some time playing the cash shop gating was to apparent for me. i wooden have mined if they did what other games like guild wars and warframe  does but they don't. The game was released in 2011 so i was not expecting to much but they really need an update to their UI. i do not recommend this game. i have uninstall this game.			"

But, I stopped playing PS4 and switched to PC full time, this would be all well and good if I could buy the DLC here :/ Game is amazing, granted the communitys a lot smaller than how I remember but its still a fun game. After messing around for 8 hours I decide to try get the subscription, NO PAYMENT OPTION THROUGH STEAM.Why, why is this game on steam if I can't pay through it???? I don't have a credit card, no I don't want one. I like my pre-paid steam cards, they are what I usually spend my excess money on, the tought that I am limited to payments of american credit cards when I live in the EU is.....disappointing. VERY disappointing. I am not rating this game bad because of the game, I am rating this game bead because they refuse to take the money I throw at them, GG DCUO, well played, now to uninstall.			"

												I believe this is a highly underrated game. While I haven't played in years, I know you can not pay a dime, while not being able to play any endgame, there is much fun to be had.For me, I mostly enjoyed my knowledge of heroes and villains in the DC universe increasing 100 fold.  From the big ones to the small, there are so many encounters, either talking or fighting to be had.It's beat to approach this not as mmo, but an rpg.  Bring a friend or 3 and do the many 4 man instances or 2 man ones.  Even alone groups can be found and there is much lore to dive into.You get many customization options from powers to weapons.  So any power can be combined with any weapons giving you so many choices of specs. While your power stays the same, weapons can be changed very often.The minimal abilities is great as well. Most mmos give you 2 to 3 dozen buttons to push, where you have about 7 here.If you're a super hero, comic, or DC fan you have nothing to lose by checking out this free game.If you're looking for an mmo to dive into hardcore, you need to spend money and you're probably better off playing a newer mmo.

												Jogo simplesmente sensacional! O que posso dizer de um jogo como este, onde eu posso criar o meu próprio Super-Herói ou me inspirar nos que eu assistia e lia quando criança? Poxa, encontrei esse jogo tarde de mais eu acho, gostaria de ter o conhecido mais cedo, porque cara, que joguinho pra viciar. Os gráficos para um MMO são lindos, e os poderes que se pode ter também. As quests são em geral fáceis, mas as dungeons são muito ♥♥♥♥! Proporcionando ao jogador uma dificuldade razoável, onde várias vezes você vai morrer, até você achar o ponto fraco do inimigo e bater lá. O jogo tem um sistema de cash e premium member, ou Legendary, mas não muda em nada o gameplay, só da ao jogador vantagens de ter TODAS as DLCs do jogo de graça e a opção de criar uma Liga, e o preço do membro mensal não chega a ser tão caro, R$23,99, sendo que nos EUA são U$14,99, ou seja, estamos saindo com lucro, pois a mensalidade seria quase R$60,00. Mas enfim, não estou dizendo para você pagar mensalmente, você pode simplesmente comprar as DLCs e viver sua vida.   A busca pelo level 30 é complicada, demora bastante para você upar, tendo que fazer duas ou até mesmo 3 missões para upar metade do level, mas é assim mesmo, se você quer facilidade vai jogar Minecraft.    Enfim pessoal, jogo 100% recomendado, se você gosta do universo DC, você vai amar esse jogo, os gráficos são lindos, a jogabilidade quase que perfeita, a história é boa, e a dublagem em inglês sensacional.

I don't have a credit card, no I don't want one. I like my pre-paid steam cards, they are what I usually spend my excess money on, the tought that I am limited to payments of american credit cards when I live in the EU is.....disappointing. VERY disappointing. I am not rating this game bad because of the game, I am rating this game bead because they refuse to take the money I throw at them, GG DCUO, well played, now to uninstall.			"

												You can CLIMB WALLS, USE A GRAPPLE HOOK, BECOME A DOG, BECOME A GORILLA, BECOME A DRAGONFLY OR JUST EVEN FLY IN THE AIR, RUN FAST ON WATER, RUN UP BUILDINGS, RUN DOWN BUILDINGS, BECOME A WOLF ON TWO LEGS--yeah this game is pretty good.Other than the fact that my zipline bugs out and I can't use it sometimes as a Nature Powered Acrobat, this game is good.

												The game as it is seems like a fun little model, however if you want to experience the game as it should be experienced you'll have to lighten the load of your wallet first. That said, as an MMO-RPG game if you wanna pay for a quality product you're better off paying for something like World of Warcraft. If the game didn't restrict content behind paywalls it'd be a fine game to main but as it stands right now you just don't get the bang for your buck.			"

												Not bad nor awesome game, but an overall good game. The gameplay is somewhat restricted for my taste as are the choices of powers, prowess, demeanor, outfit and weapons.But as i said, you can still enjoy the game somewhat ifyou're content with what it offers.			"

												This games pretty fun and it sticks to the dc hero/villain storys very well. The game play is fun and and you don't have to worry about playing solo very often.What i cant stand is when devs take a good game and make a cash cow out of it. I've been playing on my ps3 and let my say if you dont have a big wallet you wont do very good in this game after level 30(level cap before combat rating levels take place)I've had a problem in this game where my gear breaks and the escrow(money cap where you can only spend your amount of money thats under that money cap) prevents me from reparing my gear thus forcing me to sit around and do nothing or be a dead weight to my group mates. Also to get the escrow removed you either have to become a member(monthly pay) or purchase a 7 day escrow thing in the shop.Im not gonna give my money to devs that would make a great game pay to win just to fill there pockets "

												Fun but so ♥♥♥♥ing freemium its not even free to play. Its just free to download. Will not reccomend until they get rid of these ♥♥♥♥ing paywalls. To give an example to those considering playing this game, you literally have to pay to join the server quicker, otherwise you wait in a giant que. Over 8 of the power sets, all of them the coolest ones (default ones are ♥♥♥♥) are premium, as well as a weapon, a movement style, all the cool episodes, and even the ability to have more than 1500 ♥♥♥♥ing cash. The gameplay is breathtakingly fun and I love the game, but this DLC whoring and freemium ♥♥♥♥ is overboard. If you are restrained enough not to spend money, play this game, it is extremely fun, but be careful of the money whoring.			"

												How did this game survive when City of Heroes died out?I have played through the game three times now and completed the story as a Tech, Meta, and Magic character. But once you hit level 30 and complete the main story, there is nothing left to do except PVP, which unless you're shilling out the dollars (or whatever currency your country runs on), you're pretty much guaranteed to lose.The power selection is also EXTREMELY limited compared to other super hero games like City of Heroes, or Champions Online. Each power set is divided up into two types which as far as I can tell boil down to DPS vs Crowd Control.Their website hasn't been updated since War of the Light, so I'm going to tell you which power sets are available in the game as of the time of writing this. The Power Sets for those who aren't paying a subscription are Fire, Ice, Gadgets, Mental, Nature, and Sorcery.The powers sets for those who do pay a subscription includes the previons ones, as well as Light (green / yellow rings), Rage (red ring), Earth, Lightning, Quantum (time / space),  Blessed / Cursed (good and evil magic), and Munitions (lots of guns).They also plan to include additional paid for powers such as Water and Serums.Unfortunately these new power sets contribute nothing to the game's replay value. The story is the same regardless, and once again, there's nothing to do except PVP once you complete it.The game has also begun to die out. When I first starting playing the game, the streets were filled with heroes and villains. When I tried to do a PVP server, I could scarcely go on a mission without being dog piled by the enemy team. Now the game is mostly deserted on both PVP and PVE servers. I think I found maybe 2 or 3 enemies that were still hunting players on PVP servers, but that's it.The only travel powers that are any fun is Speed Force and Acrobatics. Flight and the hover discs are a joke, nobody seems to like them. Probably because at a certain level, you can get a jet booster with Acrobatics that allows you to get around just as easily as flight, and in a much faster method. That's right, FLIGHT is the slowest travel power in the game!The game also lacks a character diversity concept such as races. I get that the story is that you were a human that inherited super powers, but they could have at least included a racial template such as Thanagarian, Kryptonian, Martian, Atlantean, Cyborg, Robot, and so on. You can get skins for some of these races, and you can get similar powers, but these are purely cosmetic and don't affect your strengths and weaknesses at all.DC Universe Online is a super hero game that falls short when compared to many other games of its genre. It is not worth the money they want you to pump into it, and is already dying as it is. The game should be allowed to go out with whatever dignity it has left, rather than trying to resuscitate it.

												Marvel Comics ""DC Universe"" is a simulation title, which allows the player to pretend to be a little girl, pretending to be a super hero, or villian.  You will spend several hours selecting combination of tights and capes which are not as inhumanly offensive to the eye possible, and then mash the ""1"" through ""4"" keys repetedly untill completion.  The game ends when players collect all of the missing pages of the Necronomicon, and return the missing $20 to Slenderman.  There is a twist ending, where the players and Christopher Walken go to Denny's, but it's only achievable by using Canadian currency in the slenderman scenario.			"

												Here's a little background to justify my statements. I started playing this game shortly after release as a FREE player. DCUO at that point was fairly balanced and didn't show much of a P2W advantage for being a premium member and paying for the sub, but there were some advantages. Having a limited amount of usable credits on hand wasn't a big deal if you knew how to manage your spending and income you could side step the escrow emplaced on the F2P players. I later paid for the premium and maintained it for about 3 months, allowing me to make new characters with the new powers they released in the expansions (when I cancelled my sub, I lost access to the expansions, but was able to maintain the characters made from them) which was the main reason for me getting the premuim for that duration.This game is fun, the play style is exciting and is enhanced moreso when playing with a friend. The outfit choices are pleasing and the higher tier gear has those iconic looks that everyone should crave.This game has a low level cap mainly because it's designed for end game PVP, the PVP is unbalanced and broken, good luck finding anyone to go up against in the 8 vs 8 arena. They added a cool down to the que and made it cost real money to run more than once a day on pretty much all instances and arenas (which are the end game things to do). Basically after hitting 30 and having done all your main story line mission, you'll get bored real quick and decide to play something that has more to offer.I suggest finding a different game until the devs make some major changes to this game.

												It's sad, the potential it had, ruined by microtransactions and random DLC. It's like what another user said in the game, the developers serve you a cookie crumb and it's the best cookie crumb you had. They offer you another crumb from their cookie and price it something like $15, and that's when you pay it only to find out it tasted the same as the regular cookie crumb you got. I fully agree with that, and it's not the end of the trail of cookie crumbs, ooooh no, my friend. It's just the beginning of a long-line of microtransactions just so you can feast on the rest of the cookie crumbs. It's even worse when you look outside of the DLC and into the other microtransactions. WHAT!? I NEED TO FORK OVER MORE CASH JUST TO GET TO CONTINUE PLAYING THE GAME!? When I first saw this, I felt like growing my hair long enough to make a noose from it as it's still attached to my head. Wait, MORE MICROTRANSACTIONS!? I feel like it's rather a freely-microtransactionable-playable game than a free-to-play game. Nevermind the amazing gameplays that are possible, microtransactions bring the buzzkill. All I ask about this game for it to be approved is simple; loosen up on the DLC and remove most microtransactions so we can feel like it's an actual free game. Maybe then I'll return to the game. Before I end this rant, let me tell you...I don't care if you like the game (if you do, good for you) or if you hate the game, all I care is to warn you to not waste your money on this game's wasteful time of DLC and fun (economically and literally) absorber of microtransactions. Spending your money on a wishlisted game instead is something to do better than falling into the microtransactions like a internet using idiot falling easily to viruses. I hope you enjoy your day if you took the time to read it all.			"
