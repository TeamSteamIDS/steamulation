												I enjoyed this game immensely. It was very obviously made by an indie studio and it shows in the minor grammatical errors (which do lend it some charm). There are lots of different types of weapons, each having their strengths & weaknesses. You can only carry a limited amount of ammo which means you'll be using all of the weapons instead of just the most powerful one. Has minor RPG elements. Graphics are good and quite charming. The dungeons are randomized, but the game probably doesn't have much replay ability. I heartily recommend this game!			"

												Well this game definitely wont be the best you ever play. Its simple but not easy. Weapons offers enough variety to spend cuple hours filled with good amount of fun. On the other hand its a little bit repetitive and for sure you will encounter some annoying bugs. But after all you wont regret buying it in sale or in bundle. 6/10 (Sorry for my English and have fun)			"

												Larva Mortus is a top-down shooter. You go from room to room killing everything with up to eight different weapons. You can level up your stats, play through tons of levels, or you could just play something else.The biggest problem with LM is that the difficulty is unbalanced. When you select your difficult setting, you're actually deciding on how much you want to be annoyed. This game features a lot of small enemies, some that leave trails of fire everywhere, spit multiple projectiles, and even randomly become invincible. The harder difficulties mean you have to put up with more of their crap, blow through all of your ammo, and possibly get killed in the process. The easiest setting seems like the best choice, since all difficulty really affects is how much the player does and takes damage. However, this setting also makes the game too easy...which I guess is to be expected...hm. Regardless, the alternative is pointless frustration.Insta-death also starts to become a common theme later in the game. Devils and Champion Knights have attacks that'll kill you regardless of health or difficulty. Circle-strafing is a good method of avoiding this deadly attack, but these jerks tend to attack in groups, and other enemies lending a hand. Still, death really isn't very punishing, unless of course you managed to collect a rare item. There are a number of unique treasures that strengthen the player or offer a big XP bonus. These are lost if you die before completing the stage. Strangely, all of the achievements are tied to these rarities, you don't even get a cheevo for beating the game.Larva Mortus is just a very dull game. Within 15 minutes you've seen most everything the game has to offer, and yet it just keeps going for hours, without purpose or entertainment value. There are a few moments of satisfaction, like blowing up a half-dozen monsters with a cannon, or shooting a werewolf in the face with a shotgun, but you can get more entertainment from playing a classic FPS like Doom. This game consists of running through rooms, occasionally finding something interesting, sometimes dying, and just never really caring.  Your free-time is more valuable than that.			"

GeneralLarva Mortus is a typical example of a isometric budget shooter with semi-cartoonish graphics. The interesting in it is the extremly low price due the constant 90%-off price label, which puts it into the bellow 50 cents category. And for that it offers quite a few good things.GameplayWe are controlling a monster hunter looking guy from a birds perspective, which gives us a quite good overview trough combat. Our hero is easy to work with, which is definitely welcomed as combat always happens in cramped rooms. The mechanics is exactly this - you basically go from room to room and clean them out from monsters. Levels are generated randomly so you never know into what you go, but as long the level design regardless of the environment serves the same purprose, it doesn't really requires you some change in tactics or would surprise you in any way. The enemies vary from basic undead, flying bats to spiders and poison spitting fat zombies. Except the boss level templars, they don't really represent any serious force and usually are trying to make up for the lack of their power with rather high numbers. Very importantly - try not leave the room until is not cleared out entirely, cause the room will reset even if only one enemy remains and you need fight the horde once again. Exceptions might be missions where you need to rescue a certain number of civilians, blasting trough the rooms and just focusing on the rescue can save some time and nerves. Sometimes you need to find a key in order to continue, but it means cleaning a few more rooms into a other direction, until you eventually find what you searched for. Except the enemies the room also contain ""furniture"" like coffins and crates, which I recommend to destroy, cause you might get stuck in them in middle of combat and enemies can corner you, plus there is a chance that they might drop ammo or powerups. (see bellow) Unfortunately the game gets eventually a bit dull after some hours spent in it and you usually keep going only to raise your level and find some new item. It simply lacks the depth, but I think it's forgiveable by such a budget title.StoryWhile it might sound weird, it actually features a working story. It's your typical ""find missing ancient artefacts and beat some evil monsters trying to take over the world"" B (or C?) class movie type of story, already the fact that there is actually one and with animations/voicing included, is quite surprising (and very welcomed) which might raise it slightly above other games of this category. What I noticed the doing random levels while being in middle of the story can cause some bugs. Is highly recommended complete it first.Leveling, weapons, artefacts, powerupsLeveling - And yet another surprise for your cents, the game has actually a RPG system. Each level you get a point which you might use for raising you stats. Personally I found some more useful as others. I highly recommend to put many points as possible into Endurance and Regeneration, (6+ recommended) First raises your HP and the other speeds up healing which might be crucial on more difficult levels. I also recommend to raise your walking speed and luck to get more drops from destroyed enemies of crates. Other abilities doesn't have such influence and are okay with 2-3 points.Weapons -  plenty of them and they are rather balanced. Is always the best to switch whatever has the most ammo in it. Of course certain weapons are better into certain situations, like the machinegun is best against weak huge groups, while the shotgun is better against individual strong enemies. Don't worry, as you play, would fill eventually figure out all of them.Artefacts - pretty much the alpha and omega of this game. While many of them adds only points to your score, other give you huge advantages, which will change your game dramatically. I highly recommend to get the backpack, extended clips and enchanted scroll so fast as is possible. Backpack raises the carried ammo by a huge ammount, extended clips raise the magazine to 120 by one of the most used weapons and the scroll doubles the time duration of all powerups.Artefacts can be found randomly in dungeon, but the game doesn't excludes the already found ones. so it depends on pure luck. But assuming in certain levels you can find 3 at once, you will eventually get 100%. On sidenote, you most successfully complete the level to keep the artefact. If you die, they get lost. Can be quite the bummer.Powerups - unlike artefacts, they are only temporary. However they can change the tide of the battle dramatically, especially if you have a good luck (more powerups) and the scroll, which doubles the duration. Unlimited ammo with the machinegun and double damage can literally make you to a walking terminator.GraphicsOne of the biggest cons of the game is the low resolution. Is quite noticable that is a ported mobile game. While the graphics aren't bad and objects stay sharp even on my full HD screen, the devs could have added a option of standard desktop resolutions even if it would be achieved with simple stretching.Music and soundsModern/organ combo which gives away a creepy cemetery feeling. Few and repetitive, but suits the game rather well. I cannot say anything else as I really liked it. If there would be more tracks, I would ask the devs for a OST. Really.AchievementsBasically all of the achievements are connected to finding the artefacts. As I mentioned, there is a high chance that you find the pieces same over and over, but you will eventually find all of them, even if means a bit of grinding. One of the easiest games on Steam to get on 100%.ConclusionDo I recommend this game? Definitely yes, if you find that 90%-off price tag on it. While this game will not cause a panic in the game stores, it offers quite a fun for a few cents.My rating: 6/10			"

												This is a top down retro shooter. Each level is randomly generated, and you must clear every bad guy in the room  before progressing. If you die, you start the level again on a new completely random map. I normally would find it annoying starting all over again, but this mechanic stops you from just running trial and error to eventually get through.You get a pretty standard set of guns, twin pistols, shotgun etc, all of which can be upgraded. I ran into no bugs and the games run very well on new operating systems.The price is right and the game play is good. If you like the horror genre, and love the arcade games from the past, then you will get plenty of enjoyment out of Larva Mortus			"

												A top-down horror shooter with very arcade-like action; you'd think it would be twin stick but it's not. The game is mission-based and you select from either story or randomly generated missions on a world map. Missions take place in a small, NES Zelda-style dungeon with an objective. Random missions give you a chance to level up, find artifacts and better weapons before progressing with the story. Upon leveling, you can put points into stats like max health, regen, run speed and resistances, adding some lite rpg elements. You'll amass an arsenal of weapons you can switch between at any time, from the basic revolver and shotgun to flamethrowers and cannons.Natively, the game runs at 1024x768, but looks fine and the Steam overlay works. The story is dull and short; most of your hours will come from grinding, due to the difficulty. Repetitive and shallow, I can't really recommend it with so many other games to play.			"

Overall its a solid game, but not for everyone. Even though I found its artstyle incredibly lacking, I will reccomend this game and give it a solid 5/10.

												Larva Mortus is a top-down shooter with nice 2D graphics and fast-paced combat. While it has a campaign with a story it's nothing you haven't seen elsewhere already. Still, completing the story still makes the world map available where more and more quests pop-up so that you can play for a long time.You have a decent array of weapons and a few dozen unique enemies and of course some RPG elements just to make sure you like getting things going. Achievements are related to special objects found throughout the levels which randomly pop-up - if you have only a couple of more left you may find a bit tedious to lay your hands on these few.The game is regularly on sale so this is an easy grab for a couple of hours of pastime.

												This game lacks any remarkable quality that justifies buying it, even on a sale. It's basically a twin stick shooter (without controller support) where the player scuffles through randomized (but persistently unstimulating) dungeons, fending off flocks of uninspired enemies to tediously grind through a few repetitive mission objectives, all tied together by the most perfunctory of stories.     The game's design and visuals transpire blandness. Enemy variety consists of the trite assortment of bats, spiders, skeletons,  zombies, werewolves and respective supersized variants. Moreover the monsters are afflicted by extremely constrained behaviour types, limited to either rushing the player, casually flying around or throwing the odd missile. This cognitive impairment makes the enemies prone to getting stuck behind objects and frequently kamikaze into the environmental traps, and the only challenge comes from the occasional overwhelming numbers of enemies.     Due merits for the low hardware requirements, which allow to run it in a modest 5 year old computer, but when the game looks over 10 years old that's hardly a redeeming feature.     This is an inexpensive game that nevertheless feels too cheaply made for its price, and I can't find any reason to recommend playing it even if it finds its way into your steam account after a bundle sale.

												This game is a guilty pleasure for me.There are lots of mechanic glitches/shortcomings that impede progress that you have to deal with ---- such as being in a dungeon then finding yourself at the map having to start the dungeon again, losing your total score (keep a careful eye on the score, and if it happens, exit the dungeon, and your score will be where it was), difficult to understand instructions, and the lack of any sort of in game help.But in spite of all this, I love the game.The challenge is high (even on easy), the fun level is great, and the music is great.As you travel from one monster lair to another, you build your experience (points), and maybe ultimately defeat a difficult boss.The story is presented well, and motivates you to keep hunting for the pieces of the missing artifact.I like that you can play in short sessions, or devote most of an evening if you want ---- so I'll keep at it. But, be warned, even with all its problems it is very addictive. There's a demo, so give it a try.eta ---- there is a basic manual available on the store page that offers some help.			"

												Not one of the best PCgames out, but...  Well, its better than many of the games that were coming out for the Atari 400 back in the early '80's.  In the '90's it would have been shareware or freeware.  But due to inflation over the last twenty years what used to be free now costs money.  Well, maybe that's not exactly why, but it's the best lie I could come up with on short notice.The game isn't all that bad if you come home from work or school brain dead and need something really nit-witted to unwind with, or if you happen to be an anacephalic gammer, in which case you probably aren't reading this review.  For those of you who are off to uni and have to work your way through, this is the game equivilent of ramen noodles for supper every night.  You put up with it for a few years so thatyou can get a better job and the better standard of living that goes with it.  Or so the schools' admissions propaganda would have you believe.  The fact is that you can get an Ox-Cam education and still end up eating dry cat food, living under a bridge, and playing the solo version of tic-tac-toe in the dust.  That's when ramen and Larva Mortus start looking really good.The game does have its place,even in the library of a power gamer.  Just make sure you get it when its on sale, and preferably when its under 75p (1 dollar for those of you in the US.			"

												Top down action RPG-lite with a nice atmosphere, a range of weapons and items to pick up to improve your character, a few mission variants to do, although they mostly come down to either killing everything on each map, or killing almost everything on each map, and a reasonable variety of bad guys to take out where most of your enemies require different weapon preferences/tactics to deal with.The story has you as a Van Helsing style dispatcher of evil who gets letters from various parties who have some supernatural trouble, and a rating for how difficult it is (1-5 stars), some of the letters will be story missions which advance the plot, or you can do side missions to try to find those extra bits of equipment you are missing. Unfortunately if you want to find them all that will take quite a while (and is very luck dependant), and things will probably start getting a bit monotonous, but if you limit it to just doing some of the side quests and run through the storyline you probably won't be struck as much by the limitations of the amount of enemy types, locations/maps and missions.Overall a cautious recommend as a bit of lightweight RPG action gameplay, but expect boredom if you want to get all the achievements.

												Larva Mortus, a top-down retro shooter, kinda like all of those flash games out there like Dead Frontier. You're playing as some kind of monster hunter, and you travel across the world to certain hotspots where monsters, ghosts, demons, werewolves, or whatever kind of evil have been causing trouble freely to end their mayhem spree. This game is a weird one. I know for a fact that people frequently disagree when it comes to this game, some say it's bad, some say it's pretty decent. My opinion? Well, I would personally recommend it.It's buggy, sure, it gets kinda repetitive, sure, but the gun combat is quite satisfying, at least to me. You start the game on the map screen, and across the world, you'll find missions that you can do, a few story ones, and lots and lots of optional missions, from killing ever single enemy to destroying altars that summon them, to killing special ""champion"" enemies, to rescuing ♥♥♥♥ing lost souls that wander in front of your projectiles all the time, the worst so far to me. It's gameplay is rather simple, you aim and shot with the mouse, controlling a crosshair on the screen, and you move and perform actions with the keyboard. At first, you move rather slowly, but you can upgrade your movement speed each time you level up, among other things like your resistance to debuffs (Some, like the ghost's projectile that turns you into a sitting duck, not being able to move and attack), which is quite useful, your regeneration speed, your melee damage, your luck and how fast you get experience points. You get experience points by killing enemies, collecting stars, or performing certain other actions. Randomly, a ""jumpscare"" (More like a JPG. file with a weak sound, I don't know if they were even trying to go for jumpscares) will pop out, a face, a low volume noise, and that's about it. It doesn't spawn more enemies, damage you, or change anything in any way.When it comes to quests, the main storyline quests are quite easy, even on hard difficulty. The optional quests, on the other hand, can be quite merciless at times. The only benefits that you get from these quests are the experience points, and the chance to find one of the upgrade items that randomly spawn inside a level. Sometimes they spawn on the main missions, and they aren't necessary for the game completion. Hell, they don't even count if you want to get the game's 100% completion. They do, however, upgrade your weapons, for example, the backpack allows you to carry more ammo, the dum dum bullets increase the damage of your revolver by 25%, and the holy water allows you to do an extra 10 points of damage to demons. Some of the collectible items do not upgrade anything at all, they just give you experience points. If you die during the mission, said randomly spawned item is lost forever!....Until you get lucky enough to find it again.It's soundtrack is decent, it's got plenty of subtle sounds that add a nice touch to the creepy atmosphere of the game. It's nothing too loud or obnoxious, but nothing that noticeable, neither. The game can get monotonous if you start doing every single side mission, because it's mostly about shooting enemies all the time with the same weapons. You'll randomly find them in some missions, stuff that goes from a sword and revolver that you start with, to a shotgun, a cannon, a manual machine gun, a flamethrower and a tesla gun, among other weapons. You keep these ones even if you die during the mission. Now, when it comes to difficulty, sometimes it's way too easy, sometimes it's relentless, because sometimes you'll have to fight against enemies that can basically fill the screen with projectiles, and some of them are quite damaging. Also, there's that ghost enemy that's able to paralyze you with it's projectile, and there are two enemies in game that possess a one hit kill ability. The big red demons with their short ranged, easy to avoid flame spray, and the big crusaders with their almost no warning, long range, but easy to avoid ray that comes out of their swords. If you play this game on hard difficulty, you'll probably get your ♥♥♥ kicked a lot. There are on achievements for finishing this game on any difficulty, so you might as well play on easy. The achievements of this game are unlocked when you collect said random relics in missions. Now, for the BUGS.- Collission detection is kinda off at times. Some items possess a hitbox that's got a different shape or a different size than the item they are around. Most of the items can be destroyed, so this is mostly  a problem if you're trying to hit and run. But it's quite a problem when you're trying to get across moving traps.- Sometimes, the enemies, and even lost souls, vanish completely from the room. Even if you killed every visible enemy, you'll hear one of them lurking  around, and the room won't count as fully cleared until you get out and come back in again. It's not that frequent, but when it happens, it's mildly annoying.All in all, I would recommend this game if you are a fan of over the top, kinda monotonous shooters. It's rather cheap, and you can finish it in a few hours. You can also wait for it to go on sale, if you don't feel like the game's worth it's full price.			"

												You are a hunter of supernatural creatures in the 19th century, sent to performed exorcisms on the demons and hellspawn that litter the land. Five men stumble across an evil artifact and split it between them, now for some reason evil wants the five pieces back. It’s up to you to reunite the five pieces before the evil demons do. Gameplay is of the top-down variety, movement is done with WASD and aiming is done with the mouse. Your weapon selection is pretty generic and grows as you find new weapons. Monsters are also pretty generic, running the gambit of skeletons, spiders, bats and zombies. The graphics are decent and the story is told via static images, done in a comic book style. The game is terribly average and doesn't try anything new, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, however that isn't the part that makes the game boring to play. It’s how the developer setup advancing the story that bores me to tears.The game starts off by showing a mission that will start the story, but you cannot start the mission without leveling up first. You level up by selecting other non-story missions that will appear randomly after every level you beat. Each non-story mission can have a different flavor: save X amount of people (which you don’t even have to save technically, you just get a higher score if you do save all of them), clear all rooms of monsters, defeat X boss monsters, or remove X ritual circles from the area. Here is the crux of the problem. The game requires you to be X level before continuing the story, you level up by repeatedly playing randomly generated dungeons with a very limited amount of goals for each dungeon, with a very limited variety of enemies, on levels that use a very limited number of tile sets. After the first few playthroughs of the levels just to start the storyline line I saw every level and enemy type. I played through the story mission only to find out the next story mission was yet again locked, and I had to be a certain level to play it. Which meant more grinding through randomly generated dungeons with little variety to advance the story again.See the rest of the review here: http://www.skepticalminotaurgames.com/larva-mortis "

												Who made this piece of crap?This game had something, I don't know if the name or the cover, that made me want to have it so bad, but please, I encourage you to watch a gameplay before buying this. It looks like a website's amateur made flash game. And well, there were lots of great amateur made flash games out there, but this one definitely isn't one of them.I'd rather be playing Backgammon, even though nobody understands that ♥♥♥♥.			"

												I honestly don´t know why the press kinda liked this game: There are several free flashgames that are way better than ""Larva Mortus"" and it could not motivate me to play at all. If you are addicted to games like this for any reason and explored the whole internet then go for it in sale when it is around a buck, but don´t expect anything you have not already found.			"

												Good Top-Down Shooter in the vein of Binding of Isaac and Smash TV. RPG mechanics bring leveling to the table, and collectibles give some equipment boosts as you find them. Short game, with artifical length due to the collectible problem. Generic Enemies with generic attacks, spooky images that pop up on you screen to give you the shivahs. Mostly fun. The only problem with this game is the acheivements. Trying to get all the items is very difficult due to the random nature of the drops and the ability to gain multiple versions of the same items. Infuriated me to no end, and changed a 3 hour game into something that I ""played"" for 25 hours. Buy on Sale.			"

												I would say this game is a hidden gold nugget, not a gem, but a nugget. Its a fun top down twin stick shooter that often makes me think that SAS Zombie assult and Rouge Legacy (vaguely) had a secret affair and this was their offspring the that they hid well. As weird as that last sentence was this is a really good game. Although there is short commings that are budget and story realted it doesn't take too much away from the overall game. It keeps me coming back and I can quickly load it up for a quick five minute game or spend a chunk of time just having  a ton of fun. I'm not sure if it gets repetative yet but if you can get this game for a good price it is very fun and worth it. I bought the action Indie pack for $1.49 not expecting much but was joyfully suprised to find this hidden, unapperciatied game. Also I thought I might as well bring this up but it can be occationally be scary, not enough to send the weak hearted away but enough to be creepy. The creepy music, the horrific groans and screeches given off by some monsters, the glowing red eyes in the darkness every now and then, there is also disturbing faces that show up on the screen every now and then. Not fast enough to qualify as a jump scare but they get me (or at least gives me an usettling feeling) every time.			"

												This game is so bad. The gameplay is horrid let alone the textures. They have easily outsmarted AI and can be killed usually in 2 shots or they kill you in one. This isn't a hard game. Now the textures are horrid. You can tell some kid got these images from google or something and then fitted them on the screen. They have such bad resolution. The theme is horrid( Demons, Death , Skellingtons , Zombies Giant puking ghosts, Dying red people. The story line is impossible to follow because all it does is give poorley textured images as a result and a horrid voice over (Very much static) along with 10 things to do first and all of them are filled with the stuff I'm explaning. And random pop ups of poor res images of something that should be scary is Funny. It plays sounds when they pop up as well which is on a 1-10 optimized sound is a -3. it sounds like static and its pretty annoying because the option menu gives you Bugger all.

												A fun little gem of a game.  It had a dark, Van Helsing detective-like overtone to the story.  It packed a diverse arsenal of weapons, all important to taking out the variety of vampiric creatures.  Some creatures are easy, others are tough, quick, or powerful, with one-hit kill abilities.  Maps can be both easy and hard at the same time.  Movement skill, multiple strategies, and how you build your character is very important.  Know your weapons.  Know your enemies.  Know how to move your character around the rooms.  I enjoyed this little RPG, top-down-shooter game.  It's well worth its' price tag.			"

												This game can entertain you for hours and hours (unfortunately I don't have that time to spend on this game). Leveling system is a great thing to have in this game. The graphics may not be the best, but it's actually the gameplay that counts, right? I know I'm right. (I know that graphics count a bit, but I don't want to make it complex! They're good enough in this case!)Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												To tell the truth, I was surprised by this game.It doesn't look like much as a top down horror hack'n'slay, but exactly this spartan design is what is captivating about this, kill hordes of monsters with whatever weapon you got. Later in the game you will get better and more powerful weapons. You have to destroy monsters, hordes of them, zombies, animated skeletons, bats, spiders ... demons. I bought it as it was very cheap during last years winter holiday sales - and it lay in the backlist of my library, just recently I started to play it.Given, it isn't the best game around, but this type of game never gets old, or can bother you to be a bore. The gameplay is similiar to Binding of Issac and Our Darker Purpose. Some goals are hard to reach, but if you try to prepare you'll get more and more items that help to end your mission.For the price I bought it the game is a gem, even at the original price of 4,99 it is worth your time. The game is no hype, but it is rock solid.			"

												Overall, I enjoyed Larva Mortus.  I got the game very cheaply using a 90% off coupon and had low expectations.  I was pleasantly surprised!  It is a solid top down shooter game.  The graphics are decent and it is the kind of game you can just play 10 or 20 minutes before bed to relax.  The music is solid for the setting. It's easy to learn and get into.  There's 9 different weapons, 6 stats you can raise, and the plot isn't bad.  Without grinding, you could probably beat the game in a few hours.  I leveled up more than necessary to get more of the achievements, ended up beating the game at level 26 but you can beat it much earlier than that.  There's 24 achievements that are pretty easy to get and random drops.  I was able to 100% the game in 10.5 hours.  The last few drops can be tedious but otherwise it's pretty fun overall.  Grab this game on sale if you enjoy top down shooters!			"

												This is a top-down shooter game with some character advancement elements that are very simple. The story is bland and in reality doesn't matter, as you just go from location to location and usually need to kill all monsters that are there. It was fun for about an hour for me, but as you can see in other reviews out there most people find this game pretty entertaining.Pros and cons:+ many weapons to choose from+ shooting is actually pretty fun- gets repetitive in about an hour- you gain levels pretty slowSo, if you would like to check it out then wait for some sale or grab it in some bundle. ---------- For anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/ "

												Larva Mortus is an old-school overhead game with action that is constant and random levels to keep you on your toes. The game has a nice set of weapons to use on the forces of evil (of which there is a nice variety), and the sound track makes up for the 2D graphics.One problem I encountered was all your progress is lost when (not if) you die, and rooms must to cleared completely are the room will just respawn when you re-enter (however, good if you are farming). This can make it feel a little repetitive, but it’s still fun to play through the storyline.Not sure if this game is for everyone, but if you are not a snob for graphics and especially if you like top down shooters then this is a must buy for the price.

												This game is a top-down view, action adventure role-playing game. It has quite a bit of weapons, powerups, and a lot (emphasis needed) of levels and missions. No two levels are exactly the same, and by a wide variety. In this game you play as a monster hunter (basically) and you must kill them. Each mission tells you what to kill, who to save, what to do, etc. The achievements are fairly easy (but take a little while) to get because you have to play the missions and find these special little powerups that'll do things for your character (look at achievement list).TL;DR AARPG that is super fun. You kill monsters, and they have fairly easy achievements. I would rate it 6/10 above average expectancy.			"

												An old but not superannuated adage is applicably germane.  Don't judge a book by it's cover.  Presented in glorious 1024x768, Larva Mortus is a pleasing overhead arena shooter with an RPG component and weapon and item drops to facilitate your pilgrimage through the ho hum narrative.  A more than decent arsenal compliments the massacre of an array of imaginative aberrations under an umbrella of vampiresque themed music.

												This game is really underrated. It's a cool top down action shooter with some RPG elements. It tells an interesting story that's obviously inspired by classic horror stories à la H. P. Lovecraft. Except for some of the sprites, the graphics are very nice and athmospheric and there are various cool comic-style cutscenes. The only downside to the game is that there are some minor bugs that are fortunately not game breaking. And you have to make sure to configure your graphics-card to not mess up the game's aspect ratio on widescreen monitors. If you can pick it up for cheap it's definitely worth a try.			"

												First thing first.Larva Mortus isn't a high quality game, it does not even try to be one. Larva Mortus is a top down shooter with flaws which offers you couple hours of entertainmentish.You play as a monster hunter doing various monster hunting tasks. Across your journeys through abandoned warehouses to cemeteries you deal with undead monstrosities, werewolves and such. All are classic horror monsters, even main character is very classical monster hunter manly man. Weapons of slay include revolvers, two handed sword, machine gun etc. etc. Nothing new, you've seen 'em and know em. Oh, you'll gain levels too.Controls work the way they should, you'll run around using wasd and with the power of mouse you'll aim and deal lead to monstrosities.First hour of this game is pretty much fun. Also first hour of this game is pretty much all this game has to offer. You run around rooms, killing monsters with guns. Then you run around killing some more. It's really repetitive, but sometimes that is just what we need.Larva Mortus has serious balancing issues. Instant death dealing monsters, unbalanced weaponry, easily predicted enemies. Difficulty level is a rollercoaster ride in this game. Too easy from pain in the behind hard, no gradual progress in there. Character development is simple as it should be. Problematically you can level up your character to be almost useless.  (Free tip, first 5 points goes to walking speed)  Still the game has few good horrorish moments and pretty good ambience. Music is nice for the first hour and then it you'll start wishing this game had few more songs. I had no techical issues with game and it ran smoothly.Main campaing is playable only by leveling up via random quests. These put you around the globe for uh, monster killing, saving people or, you know, killing monsters. Also you can get quest for eradicating monster sings, which is basically the same thing as monster killing.I recommend this game for horror and top down shooter fans who can deal with B-quality stuff.

												This game is littered with small bugs and glitches,and while it has a cool artstyle (in my opinion) and a nice setting,the mass of errors and just weird design decisions make this game annoying really quickly,while it has some cool things like missions which you access from the world map(a thing about that later) they make no f*cking diffrence because you do the same 5 missions OVER AND OVER,this is NOT fun and dynamic,this is a cheap game and it's from a small company so maybe i'm a bit harsh on it when i say that the game sucksshooting doesn't feel satisfying,animation quality is lackluster,the music is good however it only has like 4 tracks which made me turn that off in about an hour and put on my own music while playing the gamethis game isn't horrible,it has some good things like the setting and the (sort of) creepy atmosphere that hangs around the game but it has too many bugs and glitches like screenshots not even coming out properly(just a black screen) and when i alt tab out of the game it goes all wonky and i can't even use the Steam community in the game because typing is really laggy for some reason,oh and also my laptop hates the fog in this game,even though it shouldn't even lag on that it drops the game down to 15FPS from a solid 50 >.>oh and that thing about the world map? apparently the developers think Algeria is in ♥♥♥♥ing SWEDEN while Sweden is in what looks like Finland/Russia -.- if you have to have a map in your game of our world at least put some effort in it to make it topographicly correct....because Algeria is in Africa "

												I bought this game as part of a bundle. It was dirt cheap, so I wasn't expecting much.Long story short: this game has a ton of atmosphere draped over a fun little action romp. You move from room to room, clearing out monsters, the undead, and cursed altars (monster generators) while switching between your different weapons and trying to stay alive. What makes this game unique is its dedication to its bizarre and weird story. There's lots of little touches - fog effects, spooky hallucinations, creepy music and sound effects, and a storyline that would feel right at home in a Weird Tales action story. It's cheap, fun, and spooky. You can't go wrong.			"

												Larva Mortus is a top-down shooter in which you kill various type of enemies inside a dungeon. You can follow the main storyline or just complete side quests as many times as you like! You can level-up your agent as you gather experience and spend your points in Observation, Constitution, Regeneration, Resistance, Luck, Walk Speed or Melee Combat.The game is cheap and quite fun, it's biggest downside are animations and small bugs. The graphics are fine for an indie game, the music is good and the game is quite addictive. I'd say it's worth purchasing this game if you are into indie Top-down shooters!Pros:-Fun.-Cheap.-6 hours+ of gameplay.-No level cap.-The difficulty is just right.Cons:-After a few hours, it gets repetitive.-The animations aren't very good.-There are multiple small bugs, such as items spawning in the ""void"" part of a room, getting stuck in moving spikes...-The achievements are purely based on luck.

PresentationIt's pretty obvious at first glance that Larva Mortus isn't going to be a life-changing experience, and for most of us playing it won't even be a day-changing experience as what seems to be an addictive and fun game at first, will turn into a boring and repetitive experience in a matter of minutes. The story takes place in the 19th Century, following a young recruit of an agency responsible with concealing and exterminating all evil creatures and their sources of power, so it won't be long before you start travelling around the globe to find all the evil lords that hold the main pieces of an artefact that allows evil to exist and expand throughout the lands, but as cool as that sounds, the way in which the game tells that story makes it boring and pointless as there is nothing else to fill in the blanks between missions and expand on the universe, instead the story turns into running from point A to point B only to then find out that you've been mislead and the thing you're looking for is at point C, kinda like a Mario game if he was looking for evil artefacts. There are also no cutscenes or voice-overs to add to the presentation of the story, so you'll be stuck with some lines of text that for most times are pointless since you can pretty much figure it out by yourself that after killing an entire castle of vampires, werewolves and bats, and still not finding the missing piece, the thing you're looking for is definitely not there.GameplayLarva Mortus had something good going on for a while and that was due to its focus on gameplay, which looks and plays great for a few minutes, as you use different weapons ranging from swords to machine guns and explosives to eliminate all sorts of enemies while you take on different objectives such as freeing lost souls, eliminating sources of power, clearing the entire area of evil presence or defeating a boss; and to make it even more appealing the game promises randomized map so no matter how many times you replay a stage, it will be different each time. The problem with all that is that once you get past the first 10 minutes, you start to realize that no matter which enemies you'll face and where you will still do the same thing over and over again; the best strategy to defeat almost any type of enemy is to run around in circles shooting forward or waving your sword around if you're out of bullets, because as long as you do that properly you'll be just fine and no matter the objective you're following, you will still have to do this over and over again just so you can eventually reach an area where you have to shoot or walk through an additional thing. As for the bosses, all of them are just versions of normal creatures with more HP, and the random maps don't really change the game at all since they just move the rooms around, so instead of taking a left, you'll take a right the next time, but end up in a similar area with similar enemies.GraphicsYou can't expect quite a lot from an indie game with a limited budget, but the biggest visual problem with Larva Mortus isn't even the engine it was built on, which is obviously old, but instead the repetitive design which makes the already boring game even more monotone, always using the same colours and textures, putting you in similar looking rooms with the same objects sitting around the same monsters coming at you every single time you play.AudioThe audio quality overall is just horrid, with missing tonality, sound effects that have no place there and even worse sounds that should've been there and they are not, and just that one song that keeps repeating again and again, and again with different effects added on the background when you enter a boss room or get overwhelmed by enemies, but even with that added, you still have to listen to the same tune that was bad to begin with.ExtrasFinishing the main campaign takes less than two hours, and even though you can play the game for as long as you want to since it will constantly provide you with missions with various objectives, taking in consideration that no matter how many of those you'll complete, nothing will change probably no one will bother to play for longer than 8 hours, which is the time it takes to obtain all items that award you with achievements if you're into those.VerdictLarva Mortus is an indie title that had something going on in there for a while, starting with cool ideas that failed to entertain for more than a few minutes due to its poor execution that ultimately provide more boredom and dullness than entertainment, making this title become nothing more than another leftover in your collection. It does come with its fun, and for a few cents that fun is probably worth it, but then again, don't expect it to last.Rating 3.7Check out the full review and a lot more about Larva Mortus at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=282[/h1] "

												This game is dumb.And it revels in its own stupidity. If anything they didn't go far enough really.You are a monster hunter of the Van Helsing variety called to investigate some strange going-ons. You eventually meet a man who claims to be cursed against his own will and only by collecting the various artifacts of doom can you save the world. Halfway through this you are hit with a plot twist from one of your would be targets that actually collecting the pieces is a bad idea and your employer is out to get you! ...he then gives you the piece anyway because hell if I know.Our character points out that since he started collecting the pieces he has suffered nightmares and ill health and nothing more so then I began to wonder if this is subtle meta storytelling like Hotline Miami where the game is telling you that all the violence can end if you stop playng the game. So I did. Hopefully he has been able to sleep better now.But a bad story doesn't make a game dumb! Well I mean it does but it can be overlooked if the gameplay is good and here the gameplay is...Not bad but not good either. This game was made back before twin stick shooters had revived popularity so it is WASD to move and mouse to aim. The game would have lended itself brilliantly to being a twin stick shooter but we can look past that...Except we can't!Why? The room layouts and the secrets and traps within are extremely reminiscent of the Binding of Issac. I played Larva Mortus first but looking at the two games side by side the similarities are noticable. Larva however is not a rogue-like and even though the gameplay is similar in a lot of areas they are very different products so don't buy Larva Mortus and expect it to play like Binding of Issac because Larva is not that punishingly hard infact it isn't hard at all but it is also not as rewarding as a result, unlike a good run in Binding of Issac.This game hasn't really aged well, the graphics are good but a little wonky in places, the music is okay but a little off in places, the sound effects are sufficent but a little mismatched in places, I don't know what it is but everything in Larva Mortus is one step to the left of mediocre but it works out because otherwise the game would be completely forgettable anyway but as it stands it is akin to '5 nights at freddies' whereby it is an experience as much as it is a 'game'.Could I recommend this game? I couldn't. If you are a Binding of Issac fan then don't buy this game and expect it to scratch that itch either. If you end up with this game in your possession however then be sure to give it a playthough, its really not offensive to the senses to play nor is it that bad of a game at all but it lacks pepper and I think it probabaly just hasn't aged well. A Larva Mortus today would be a twin stick shooter but as it stands this game is more of a relic of an age that has passed.Join Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews "

												Larva Mortus Review - Raymond KTCan't wrap your mind around such a combo? Imagine Doom-like action in which you fend off simple enemies that crowd you, ripping relentlessly at your flesh as if you were a buffet with legs. Take such madness and confine it within a cramped room, one of many in a randomized dungeon, and give it an overhead view rather than a first-person perspective. Now, to complete the Larva Mortus experience, toss in copious amounts of bloodshed and hordes of sinister creatures. I'm ashamed to have this ame in my collection due to being basically satanic.

The controls are alright with keyboard and mouse, if you have a controller it would be great. The only problem is, its not really a problem but the graphics. Are like windows 98, if they make it 1920 x 1080 it would be great. Also if it had like if you need to pass obsticles it would be better, there are obsticles but not in the way you climb or jump. But the game was not made for that, its a top down plain shooter. Overal its good I recomend it, and best part the missions are random generated.			"

												Is a cool obscure fun overhead action game. Although what you do in the first 15 minutes is exactly what you do until the end of the game so it is extremely repetative. But hey, you blast the fk out of tons of zombies and monsters and it can be challenging so it is worth a go for some mindless fun. A lot of the enemies can shoot at you, and since your main goal will basically be to take as little dmg as possible, you will be constantly circling enemies and shooting them to avoid projectiles, so stay on the move. Use melee when possible to conserve ammo. It can get really hard because you take a lot of dmg with each hit and some boss fights are hard as fk because your guy is a pu--y and dies in only a few hits. All the weapons are about the exact same weapon lineup you would find in Quake 3, including the lightning gun, and also a flamethrower and dynamite.If you want to change the game's res you have to change it in the windows appdata folder. Search the games forum for tips on this including my addition to the post with information on how to do it if you have Windows 8.1.Game is 7/10, fun but extremely repetative.			"

												This top-down dungeon crawler reminded me of The Binding of Isaac and Alien Breed, but that comparison only lasted for a few minutes until you start noticing the repetitive dungeon layouts, the predictable enemy patterns and the location of keys and bosses. The gun play is decent, but you will end up gravitating to a couple of weapons and ignore the rest. Leveling your attributes and finding collectibles are the only worthy features that will keep you slugging through this indie game. Be warned though, it seems that the supposedly random drops for achievements sometimes take an ungodly amount of hours for the last few to appear. 2/5			"

												The games lacks the kind of quality that justifies giving it a recommendation. After playing a good 15 minutes, you’ve pretty much encountered all there is the game can offer. You have the main story that you can choose to accomplish or you can alternatively go through different side missions to satisfy yourself bloodlust by blowing up monsters…...but then after a while the truth starts to sink in like the teeth of a vampire attempting to drain you dry; Larva Mortus is actually a dull and uninspiring, lacking the polish that would give it a status of a good recommendable game.

												While the game isn't unplayable it isn't a game i would recommend to anyone. According to the game i have completed 86% of it and so far most enemies just rush you down, some also have a projectile attack but thats about it for monster variety, i fought the exact same boss 3 times in blue story missions. The gunplay is dull, you run in circles until you kill everything on a room, the level up system doesn't really do anything, sure upgrading speed a couple of times is nice but most other upgrades are pointless because you can beat most of the levels on hard without ever getting hit. I died once in the game so far and that was because the first new enemy i have seen in 1.5 hours has an attack that instantly kills you if you get hit by it. "

												The game itself is decent. Shallow, but entertaining. The achievements however, are quite frustrating and very luck-based. If you're an achievement hunter like me, allow me to explain what you'll be up against.Every map is divided into small, square rooms. A few of those rooms will hold a single ""item spawn point"". One of the following can appear at such a spawn point: a key to a locked door (for the current level only) a bunch of consumables (ammo / health) one of the achievement items (chosen randomly, which means an item can appear that you already have)Keys have absolute priority for being chosen to appear, because otherwise some doors would remain locked and the level would be broken. And again, there are very few item spawn points per map. Add in that consumables appear more often than not and you're lucky to get a single achievement item per map. It goes well at first, but when I was down to the last one, that was a chance of around 4% per level? It took me two hours...I was considering a negative outcome for this review but luckily the last item appeared just in time. The combat is smooth and sufficiently satisfying. The Hellsing-ish vibe is a big positive in my mind; just imagine you're playing as Anderson. All the more so after you've edited the (plain-text) savefiles and set your Regeneration to 200.			"

												This was a pretty fun game.  If you like classic, top-down action games then you should definitely enjoy this one.  Granted, it's somewhat repetitive, but then again these types of games often are.  The random level generation keeps things fresh though (for example, if you die on a mission that comprised 15+ rooms and had you needing to kill up to 9 powerful/leader creatures to complete said mission, you may find that your retry only has you facing off against 4 powerful/leader creatures in only a dozen rooms).  This game is like a cross between Super Smash TV and Hunter:  The Reckoning, so if you liked either of those games then you should enjoy this one as well.  Also, the current $0.49 price is certainly a plus.			"

												A poorly constructed game, something you would have expected to see in the early stages of computers and game systems. Nintendo use to have better games than this. A waste of money at any cost and even free not worth playing. Something a first stage game designer in training would create in school for a credit but definitely not for sale.			"

Graphics are limited, and I'd like to be able to use widescreen, fullscreen (1920*1080), even with the classic feel of the visuals, but the price was right, bundled with a bunch of indies, for less than a couple bucks total.

												It's a pretty decent game good for a day or two. It's very challanging, the weapons are good, the story is decent, and its a good third person shooter. For 50 cents I'd say I easily got my moneys worth out of this. Meredian 4 is good at producing short games that are really good for a tiny amount of money and thats why I like it. If you can enjoy these kinds of games, then definitely get this the next time its 50 cents to a buck.			"

												This is a fun, top-down supernatural shooter.  It has great music & ambiance, interesting storyline, upgrade abilities, but only so-so graphics & SFX.  Fun to play & well worth the few bucks I paid for it (got it on sale)!EDIT: If you're into 100% achievements, I can't recommend this game for that.  The achievements drop randomly regardless of whether or not you already have them.

												Got this game on coupon AND sale for 50 cents. Not too bad of a game but I'm honestly not impressed. The game can be finished really in a few hours sitting for anyone who can play a top-down and dodge. And even on the hardest difficulty...the game doesn't seem HARD.PROS:-Cheap game. Good for if you want a top-down adventurer and something to play on the side.-Music is good. Relatively Castlevania-ish if you're into it.-Weapons do a good punch.-RPG-ish levelling system.-Powerups really make for that OOMPH-room-clear feel.CONS:-Sword is basically your meat and potatoes. Only time you really need a ranged weapon is when you need to break a flammable item, shotgun for large crowds. But hey, play your style.-Powerups have no counter/expiration timer. They'll just run out at an unspecified time randomly. Had an ammo crate I picked up from one room expire in the other after firing barely ONE shot from it. Huge minus.-Regen health kinda breaks the game. Clear a room, sit there, wait and regen and then move on. No sort of scare to fail or lose a level or actually play with some sort of score or dodging besides being instagibbed by monsters who just smack into/run faster than you.-Enemies have no kind of AI. They literally just run at you or just move around you in a circle or just chuck something at you. Some of the Champion monsters are a legit challenge...for about 2 minutes, even with enemies splintering/getting decapitated and still moving/crawling on the floor.-Yet to find a reason to use Dynamite beyond being overwhelmed by monsters. Was hoping for secret walls or doors...:(-Level up system does not allow respec. You click that button by accident? Too bad. -No real penalty for death besides just restarting at the Map screen, no penalty in exp/points. Just go repeat the stage.-Buggy rooms. I've gone into rooms and enemies are stuck against walls, in/behind objects or invisible forcing me to run in and out of the room constantly to make them reset to the point where I CAN hit them anyway.-The missions start feeling...samey...after about the 10th mission. Textured walls and floor and recolored enemies. The game starts feeling boring about 10-12 levels in.-You still pick up weapons when you walk over them even if you're full on ammo for them, leading to you practically wasting ammo sometimes-the few times you really feel the need to shoot at something. Ammo isn't scarce by any means but it's a personal peeve really. And you already carry such a limited amount of ammo as is and the ability to leave a room with 1 monster in it and come back in to farm it up for medpacks and ammo is pretty...meh.-Speaking of which: being able to run back to a cleared room and sit in it and regen HP when you get overwhelmed is pretty snoreworthy.Overall the game IS fun somewhat but I honestly wasn't impressed overall. It's an indie game and well made but otherwise, don't expect something long and involving. You can throw in a few hours with the game but it's nothing to call home about.			"

												A 'run and gun' type arcade style shooter where you are an agent working with your agency, working to cleanse the world of dangerous monsters. You do so by accepting missions, or 'calls' that take you all the way accross the world. There is a main storyline, as well as some side quests so you can level up a bit before facing boses. All in all, pretty good game. 8/10			"

												Good indie game. Fairly short, which is good because a longer game would have been too repetitive. Decent artwork, good controls, nice weapons, etc. Not too difficult. Has lots of side missions but most are optional (you only need to do them if the main quests have minimum level requirements). Side missions don't add anything to the meagre story and are more of a chore than anything.			"

												The game itself is decent. Shallow, but entertaining. The achievements however, are quite frustrating and very luck-based. If you're an achievement hunter like me, allow me to explain what you'll be up against.Every map is divided into small, square rooms. A few of those rooms will hold a single ""item spawn point"". One of the following can appear at such a spawn point: a key to a locked door (for the current level only) a bunch of consumables (ammo / health) one of the achievement items (chosen randomly, which means an item can appear that you already have)Keys have absolute priority for being chosen to appear, because otherwise some doors would remain locked and the level would be broken. And again, there are very few item spawn points per map. Add in that consumables appear more often than not and you're lucky to get a single achievement item per map. It goes well at first, but when I was down to the last one, that was a chance of around 4% per level? It took me two hours...I was considering a negative outcome for this review but luckily the last item appeared just in time. The combat is smooth and sufficiently satisfying. The Hellsing-ish vibe is a big positive in my mind; just imagine you're playing as Anderson. All the more so after you've edited the (plain-text) savefiles and set your Regeneration to 200.			"

												Larva Mortus Mask dead in Latin which is what I think they are going for because there certainly weren't any larvae in the game.  Name aside, you are a priest (I think) with various weapons against hordes of monsters.  The view is third person overhead, and you use WASD to move and can shoot/aim with the mouse.  As you kill monsters you'll occasionally find buffs to damage/armor/speed and level up which allows you to improve speed/life/regen/item drop rates/debuff length/etc.  Leveling doesn't really increase damage though so its not very useful once you get near the end of the game since monsters start to be able to one shot you.The Good:  Initially fun to play, good challenge and has nice art in the cut scenes.The Bad:  The game drags on quite a bit, especially if you are going for achievements.  There is not enough variety in monsters weapons or tactics to keep you interested, since most monsters can be defeated by strafing around them, and the ones that can't slow you and one shot you.  The bosses have so much life that it can become quite boring rotating around and around them.Takeaway: Not the worst game ever, but it might start to seem like a chore later on.The Achievements: You don't need to beat the game to 100% it oddly, but beating the game is actually easier.  On any mission, some rooms can spawn one of 25 rare items, or ammo or a key.  The problem is that getting one of the rare items doesn't take it out of the pool so getting that last one can be very frustrating.			"
