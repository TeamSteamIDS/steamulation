												Since there's no chance in hell anyone's going to see this review, I guess there's no point in me telling you that this is objectively one of the greatest roleplaying experiences in video games ever. There is also no point in me telling you that white wolf unarguably makes the greatest vampires and one of the darkest atmospheres in any kind of game, just as there is no point in telling you that this is the kind of game that has to be experienced because we will probably never get another game like this again. And since nobody can see this, there's definitely no chance anyone will ever know that I personally recommend pirating this 100% so you don't accidentally fund a terrible publisher that ruined an amazing development team. But since this is just a review, you can make your own decisions.			"

												The looks of this game are somewhat dated, but some ardent fans have made a texture-and-bugfix pack that alleviates this a little. Game is surprisingly good at conveying the V:tM atmosphere of the better pen & paper sessions I've had (the worse ones got bogged down in dice rolling -- for a system called ""story teller"", the mechanics can be annoyingly gamist). Lets you play as any of the classic clans and either sex (but looks are determined by the combination of those two factors and can't be customized further, except with clothes). I thoroughly enjoyed this game, was sad when it was over, and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone liking the pen & paper V:tM (or even just the Kindred: the Embraced show), and anyone enjoying a decent blend of fight/RP/drama elements, as long as you can get over the yesteryear graphics.If this is your kinda thing, wait till it drops to 9.99. If you're not sure, wait till it drops below 5 again. Then go for it. You'll thank me later.And then you'll be sorry because there is no multi-player, nor a steam workshop for additional campaign, so that all good things must come to an end.			"

												This is it. The quintessential vampire game. There are many reviews that highlight its pros and cons, so I will just say this: it's very good; play it. Be aware, however, that installing the unofficial patch isn't just recommended, but necessary, since the game is very buggy (which is by no means the developer's fault, but rather the publisher's). So check out the community hub for guides on how and where to get patches and various mods. First timers should also be careful in choosing the clan for their inaugural playthrough. For instance, Malkavian are a... peculiar breed, and some of the dialogue may be a bit confusing; you might also hear voices and talk to objects. Nosferatu, on the other hand, have an altered physical appearance (more ""monstruous""), so moving around and interacting with various NPCs can be a challenge; thankfully you can use sewers, and an innate cloaking ability. Even Ventrue can be difficult, because they are selective with their food; so you won't be able to feed off rats or homeless people. But all in all, the clans are pretty balanced, so it's down to personal preference29th Oct edit: It seems Paradox bought White Wolf, which means chances for a sequel have just gone up. By a lot. Rejoice!			"

												Vampire: The Masquerade-Bloodlines is an immensely intriguing vampire-role playing game by Troika Games, and an exellent example of a ""flawed masterpiece"" and had a lot of things going for it.For starters, you are thrown into the game with the option of choosing between 7 different clans (vampire bloodlines) that each play a good bit differently. There's the Brujah: fast hard hitting rebels, the Gangrel: animalistic loners, the Malkavians: bat-**** crazy psychopaths, the Nosferatu: sneaky grotesque monsters, the Tremere: a vampire sect of blood mages, the Toreador: artsy fast vampires that are closer to humanity, and Ventrue: the most power hungry members of vampire society. Every single one of these classes feels distinct, as every clan has advantages and disadvantages. For example, the nosferatu get more blood from feeding on rats than the other Kindred (Vampire: The Masquerade's term for vampire), but cannot seduce anyone because of their monstrous appearence. The Ventrue are the only kindred that can use dominate (basically mind control) in dialogue, but they cannot feed on animals and may vomit when feeding on ""lowlife"" like street bums.Now, the gameplay is extremely engaging. Combat is fast, fun, and allows you several options. Every kindred clan has their own disciplines, or vampiric abilities, that allow you to choose your own approach to conflict. Do you use obfuscate to invisibly sneak past the goons? Or do you use ""fortitude"" to soak up their bullets and ""animalism"" to summon spectral wolves to tear them apart. It's your choice. Of course there are the standard ways of fighting: guns, unarmed, and melee weapons. There are a good variety of each weapon types (except unarmed) with upgraded weapons available to you along the way. Another potential tool for combat is feeding. As you need blood to maintain your sanity and use your disciplines, you will need to drink blood. You can drink blood from any humanoid you choose, hostile or not, but it can be more difficult to drink blood from hostiles. This is tempered by the fact that you have to stop yourself from completely draining innocent humans, but don't think twice about draining a thug. There is one problem with feeding, but I'll cover that later.I need to mention the dialogue too, as it's absolutely awesome. The facial expressions on the characters in this game are better than some of the facial expressions I see in the games coming out today, and the dialogue choices are absolutely brilliant. The Malkavians and Nosferatu get hilarious dialogue options, including an infamous one where a malkavian player character can actually get into an argument with a stop sign. A stop sign! And if I remember correctly, there's a conversation with a TV as well.The quest system is absolutely one of the best parts about this game. The side quests range from defeating demons to hunting down serial killers to fighting of zombies in a graveyard. You'll always have some sort of want to complete them because completing quests gives you experience, not killing enemies. I think this is an exellent system because this keeps you from being penalized for using stealth and guile over brute strength and bloodshed. There are quite a few missions where things turn out better in the end if you choose a stealthier, more thoughtful approach instead of going full Rambo. The main quest is no slouch either, with multiple engaging quests.I enjoy the game's atmosphere quite a bit. The endless night conveys a mysterious feeling (to be fair, it's not like you're character can feel the sun anymore) and the music lends itself to this. While sometimes the music can feel a little repetitive (combat music is determined by area, so if you get into lots of fights in one area, you're gonna hear that music a lot) I never found myself annoyed by it because it was good. There are lots of songs from real bands, such as Lacuna Coil and Tiamat.Now, time for the ""flawed"" part of ""flawed masterpiece"". The game was rushed out on the same day as Half-Life 2 because the idiocy of the game's publisher, Activition. As a result, the game has several glitches by default, so don't even think about playing the game without an unofficial patch of some sort. The late game feels less fun because it's all combat, and becomes quite tedious because before, combat was more spaced out. I don't mind mandatory combat sections, but the last portion of the game gets excessive with these. Because of the mandatory combat and power of late game weapons, if you don't have your gun skill fairly high by the end, you're screwed. Melee skills only work well when you're not being shot at by 10 enemies, and that's a rarity near the end. Also, the series of levels, the Nosferatu warrens/sewers can be very boring, unintuitive, and downright frustrating at times, as there are few sources of blood, annoying enemies, it's long as hell, and mandatory. Lastly, there is the problem with feeding. When used against normal human enemies, I don't mind it. But when it's used against a human boss, it's pretty overpowered. There is no way for an enemy to escape from your grasp besides you getting hit, so if you get your teeth on a boss while they're alone, they're done. But all in all, these things don't break the game by any means, but they should be mentioned.One last thing that makes the game great, and it should be no surprise what this is: mods. There are two mods particularly, Vampire: The Masquerade: The Final Nights, And Bloodlines Antitribu (although this one is somewhat buggy at the moment). Both (and other mods I'm forgetting ATM) add in cut content, new character models, brand new content and quests, and even new systems like the companion mods and blood loss that take the games immersion to new heights.If you had your interest piqued by this review, you should definitely pick up the game. Even now, more than a decade after the games release, I still give this game a playthrough every now and then, because it's just that good.			"

												This is not Twilight. This is not Dracula. This is not Anne Rice. This is not Buffy. This is World of Darkness... and a masterpiece.Vampire: TMB's world is mysterious and complex, rich with lore from White Wolf Publishing's WoD tabletop games. The quests are memorable, characters desperate, locations varied, and character customization extensive. It is easily one of the best written RPGs ever published, right up there with the Fallout series.I would blindly recommend this to anyone remotely into verbose games. NPCs have very unique insights into the world they live in, and constantly share their philosophies with the player (the voice acting is excellent). Naturally, anyone who finds themselves bored after a few paragraphs of hearing NPCs talk should skip this game.Edit:I should have probably also mentioned that although VTMB's writing is stellar, there is also quite a bit of combat. The game strikes a nice balance between letting you feel like a ridiculously overpowered rampaging creature of the night, and a mere shadow of other, elder vampires: some fights will be hilariously easy (especially against human foes), others will be tremendously difficult (high-level supernatural enemies, yikes!). Character creation and levelling up is very comprehensive, and should be a joy for anyone who likes putting thought into how they will play the game.Please note that the game was extremely buggy when released, and is moderately difficult to run on modern PCs. See here for post-installation instructions: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2025035Shoutout to modder Wesp5 for keeping this game playable even 10 years after its original release!

Don't forget to grab the unofficial patch by Wesp5 (updated until now!) who fix a TON of bugs and restore unreleased content.One of the best rpg I've played so far. A masterpiece.To put it simply: Fantastic story, amazing voice acting, great atmosphere, loving soundtrack, multiple ways to complete missions, dialogue changes depending on clan, high replay value and multiple endings.Combat mechanics are a bit odd and outdated but whatever.Highly recommended to all rpg fans.

												This is by far one of my favorite games. I seriously play it at least once every year or so. VTMB is not your basic Vampire RPG. The game allows you to switch between first and third person, features both melee and ranged combat, and allows you mutliple paths to any of your goals. This is set in White Wolf's World of Darkness universe. If you are familiar with table-top RPGs and the World of Darkness, good, if not that is okay (I was not).The World of Darkness is your basic modern urban fantasy universe. You the player take the part of a newly created vampire thrust into a world of intrigue and darkness where ancient vampires pull the strings of humanity and each other in ever-shifting alliances and plans. The game allows you a high degree of customization, when creating your character you can choose from one of 6 clans, which feature different superpowers that your character can build as you level. There are no classes, you build your stats how you want them. Your quests almost all feature multiple paths to completion. Need to kill a vampire hunter? Well you can talk your way into her place of work (if you got the speech skills), sneak around the pack and pick some locked doors (if you have the stealth and lockpicking skills), maybe hack some computers to put the place into lockdown and get civilians to leave the area (if you have the hacking skills), or maybe you just want to kick in the front door and go to work with your katana/shotgun/teeth&claws. In this game there are mutilple paths to your goal. A few different endings (choose one of the factions or yourself), and enless playthrough ability. Visit the community forums for this game and download the fanmade patches, they will give you extra quests, clans and plug some bugs.Seriously. I can't reccomend this game highly enough.			"

												Firstly, you will need the unofficial patch to play this (so here it is: http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647.) The original devs were pushed to release this early by activision, thus it was very buggy. BUT that said, this is easily one of the best RPGs ever concieved. (Also ignore the low play time, for some reason when I installed the patch on my last system the patch only worked if I launched it off of steam, my play time probably numbers in the hundreds of hours.)So, Pros-The Role Playing aspect of this game is very deep, I haven't played a game in a long time that rivals it. You can play as one of 7 vampire 'clans' (which are basically sub species of a sort.) Each clan has it's own unique skill sets, meaning each clan have strengths and weaknesses. Whether it's the toreador with their seductive ability to manipulate practically anyone, the nosferatu, who can stealth their way into just about anywhere, or the brujah who are your more naturally brawling vampire type. Each of the seven clans has distinct strengths and distinct weaknesses. -Skill specialisation means that you can't be a jack of all trades, if you commit to being a silver tongued devil that talks their way into and out of everything, then you won't be as good at fighting. The opposite is also true, and considering that being good at persuasion/seduction doesn't result in bloodshed this means your vampire will naturally be able to accomplish things that a violent vampire would not, again the opposite is true.-Because of this, the game has vast replayability, as even a slightly different playstyle results in quite a different story. -Speaking of replayability, Malkavians are amazing, but they are insane, I would not recommend playing them on your first playthrough. Nosferatu can also be really fun, but are hard to play because you cannot be seen by mortals.-Leads me on to another important point. The Maquerade itself. The Masquerade is a conspiracy of vampire culture that maintains the illusion to mortals that they don't exist. Meaning that you can't behave in a supernatural way in certain areas, lest you violate the masquerade and incur the discipline of vampire culture. Certain abilities can still be used, depending on whether they are discreet or not, this is another layer of depth to the roleplaying system, as some vampire clans are naturally more capable in masquerade areas. For me personally, I am an avid player of the Toreador (It appeals to the part of me that adore the Anne Rice books.) This clan plays exceptionally well in masquerade areas because they are the most 'human' of all the vampire types, whereas the Nosferatu for example cannot be seen in these areas due to their appearance.-The Characters in this are not necessarily believable (some are very convincing, some are less so,) but either way the characters are... well... characters... You will love them, and you will love them a lot, the voice acting is amazing, and so is the facial animation, (which is ridiculously expressive, notice I say expressive, not necessarily realistic.) Dialogue options are also insanely awesome in a bethesda before bethesda kind of way. Cons-Combat (it pains me to mention it, but I have to.) The combat in this game doesn't bother me, but it can be a bit twitchy. Don't worry, we're not talking morrowind levels of twitchy, but it's a little twitchy nonetheless. But it's very easy to overlook because everything else in this game is so on point. -I should probably mention this as a con, but I just see it as an inevitable mechanic: There are points in the game where you simply cannot avoid intense combat. This can really annihilate a social vampire, so it's good to invest the odd point into ranged weapons once every now and then (because ranged weapons are generally the best thing to deal with the late game combat.) This seems to put some people off the game but it really doesn't bother me that much, and again i'm willing to overlook it because everything else in the game is done so damn well.In summary this game is one of the gems of the rpg genre, and you can't call yourself a fan of roleplaying games if you haven't checked this out. it is THE example of a flawed masterpiece; something which had so much ambition and very nearly lived up to it all but fell just a little short. But in spite of this the game is still way above average, and very close to perfection. And it represents something that more games developers should aspire to, because this game went for the moon, and damn nearly got there. Games aren't this ambitious anymore, they don't try to be this unusual any more, and if something did in this generation of gaming, it would truly be a masterpiece.			"

												Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is a RPG about vampires, their clans and that vampires don't show their true identity to humans for fear of being eradicated. First, vampires have a bad stand with gamers. They all remember how being a vampire sucked in Elder Scroll's Oblivion or how girls made them watch those stupid twilight movies. We have all been there, mate! ++ Jeanette and Therese.+ Good atmosphere+ Believable characters+ Picking a clan over another one matters.+ Big skill tree+ Good facial animations that hold up even today.+ Good first half of the game.+ Funny dialogue-- Major technical issues. Don't try out this game in an unpatched state. This game was an unoptimized and buggy mess when it was released and only the patches fixed it.- Combat could be better- Second half isn't as good nor fun as the first.- Some animations are awful- The endings felt a bit rushed. Some choices during the game should have mattered more.- Some maps or rooms needed more details or objects.The Masquerade is built on an early source engine version and was an unoptimized and buggy mess when it was rushly released. Note that installing either the official or the unofficial patch is essential. Additional links Unofficial Patch: http://www.moddb.com/mods/vtmb-unofficial-patchPerformance issues can be solved by vampyri_lestat's guide: https://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/914819-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines/faqs/43148Replay value: Potentially high (with different endings, clans, skills and some choices during the game)Rating: 8.5/10Recommendation: Yes			"

												Bought this game while on sale thinking it was gonna be pretty so-so. I'd heard things about Vampire: The Masquerade before, but never actually tried it. Boy am I glad I did. This game is like a hidden gem. The graphics are outdated, but what else can you expect from a game that's over 10 years old? If you enjoyed being able to make your own story in Dragon Age or Mass Effect, you may enjoy Vampire: The Masquerade, as it allows you to choose conversation options and shape your character's path. Although you can't customise the appearance of your character (other than clothing), you can choose between 7 different races of vampires of each gender, each with different abilities. Other clothing options can later be bought from the different locations throughout the game, each giving more armour and a different look from the last.The story begins with your character and the opposite gender version of your character's race getting 'friendly', and your character will be Embraced (turned). Unfortunately, your sire has commited a violation of the Masquerade by Embracing someone without permission, and is executed for their crimes. Left sireless, after an intervention by the vampire Nines you are allowed a chance to live, but you must 'serve' LaCroix, the prince. During the story, you'll learn what Sabbat, Camarilla, Kuel'jin and many other things are. But I won't spoil the story for you, go play it yourself.The downside of this game is that, in order to play it, you must do a few things. There are a few bugs that will not allow the game to play on Steam. To combat this, you must run Steam in administrator mode and change the compatibility properties of Vampire: The Masquerade. I changed the properties to run the program in compatibility mode for Windows XP (Service Pack 3), and disabled visual themes and desktop compositions. Doing these steps should allow you to run the game. But that's not all. Even though this game is old, there are still unofficial patches being made for it. I recommend installing Wesp's unofficial patch 8.9 at least, as this will fix the resolution error with the game and make the interface clear instead of blurry. Each patch contains everything from the patches before, so you can install the latest one without missing anything. The patches fix a lot of bugs and add things to the game. However, with each patch you must make it a fresh install, delete everything from the patches before (this includes your save files) and replace them with the new patch. The game may crash if you do not do this. You should replace the folder named Vampire inside your Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines folder with the patch folder, which will also be named Vampire. You must also disable the auto updates for the game in the Steam properties, or it may install the old official patch over your unofficial one.Overall, I really enjoyed this game. Some of the boss fights were quite challenging, there is a lot of side quests and missions to keep you occupied, and you can choose your character's destiny in the world of darkness. You can choose to be a saucy seductress, a badmouthed badass, anything really. And if you choose a Malkavian, you'll have different conversation options than the other races, as Malkavian's have a sort of split personality and insanity. I wish there was a sequel or something. Sucks that the World of Darkness MMO based on this universe was recently cancelled as I was looking forward to it, but what can you do.~ 9/10 ~			"

												VTMB is probably the most glitching game ever, but that doesn't really matter as I'm enjoying its amazing story and gameplay over and over again. There's always a new way somewhere to do things differently, depending on your clan, skills, gender and behavior. I'm so sorry that vampires have been so unpopular lately, but let me tell you, this is a classic. Sex, violence and fun, sometimes madness, just as it's supposed to be with vamps. I really really like the 1st and the 3rd person view switch! I give it 9,89/10! Can't wait for the HD rebirth :)			"

												It has everything a good RPG needs: A deep class system, interesting story, fun dialogue, frantic first- and third-person combat, set in an atmospheric world inhabited by humans and vampires alike. You play as a vampire and whilst having access to a vast and diverse array of powers (depending on your chosen class), you will also have to disguise yourself so as not to be discovered by humans and thus breaking the ""Masquerade"". Along with the main quests, the world is filled with many fun side missions, both of which are told through rich and interesting dialogues delivered by some great voice acting.Overall a great and unique game set in an atmospheric world; especially a must have due to its refreshing and unused setting.

												Many moons ago a developer named Troika Games released Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines yet through its lifetime it has managed to linger behind the curtain despite the generally unrivalled quality it bears. I wish to open the curtain and propose you to join me in this ‘sombre dance’. To start off you get to choose between 7 quite varied classes, called clans. Want to play as a Nosferatu and deal massive damage but have the sewers as your main travel path, or would you rather be of the noble kind, a master of eloquence and persuasion but lack physical prowess? Or maybe you fancy the clinically insane that suffers from schizophrenia? I chose the clinically insane because... well as if you wouldn't...and it turned out I chose well because the Malkavian is indubitably one of the most creative character you can play in video games.From the start, you'll notice major technical issues and design decisions that indicate the game was released on its last legs. Their dream nearly did indeed turn to dust as the company went bust soon after its release. In spite of this, the team managed to make a game that unfortunately today is a merely an ash, but a game that still to this day goes against the grain. Eventually an (unofficial) patch was released that made the game much more playable. It takes a very conventional approach to customization. On offense you can choose to specialise in guns, unarmed, melee and powers known as disciplines. The defensive counterparts also exist. Each clan has its own set of disciplines that you can specialise in. In addition you can level up skills including hacking, lock picking, intimidation, seduction, research etc and some of these skills add extra dialogue options which can lead to otherwise unavailable rewards. Loot isn’t as abundant as in Bethesda games for example but it exists in moderate amounts. The game features your standard health bar and a blood bar for good measure. You fuel your blood bar by using civilians as sustenance. The refuel rate varies on the civilian type and caution is required since if you get caught you lose masquerade points and once that reaches zero you lose the game for reasons you can find out for yourself. Additionally killing civilians (for example) will lower your humanity and once that reaches a certain point your character does bad things. The graphics are dated but definitely passable.These aforementioned issues, these run of the mill customization options are ultimately trivial because the game manages to supersede its faults completely as it ironically isn't devoid of spirit and soul. The game induces perturbation, states of uneasiness, disorientation and even sheer unadulterated terror in both expected and unexpected locations that’ll make you just wish you could give it a maniacal final vale and go make a sandwich while playing Skyrim or something. It isn't all doom and gloom though. This atmosphere, this ‘sombre dance’ can quickly shift to an upbeat vampiric club rave (literally). Of course this tonal shift is entirely at your digression but it's this type of juxtaposition that makes the sinister and foreboding moments all the more significant. The game has quite a few unique takes on conventional missions and a cast of absolutely impeccable characters. These characters can be usually manipulated depending on the clan you choose. For example If you choose the insane schizophrenic, you can use mind control on people to make weird gigglies and other disturbing lines come out their facehole which consequently will make gigglies come out of your facehole. To please the masses there’s also tons of philosophical yet hilarious one liners too.As an encore the game washes you with its masterful soundtrack. It’s an eclectic bunch of tunes that amplify the various moods you’ll feel in the game. Whether it’s ominous or calm, frantic or upbeat it does its job. At times there’s an absence of music where ambience is created by the sound of the world around you which in my mind is a soundtrack in itself. This natural ambience can be felt in many places but for the majority of people it will be most memorable in the Ocean House Hotel, considered by those who’ve experienced it as one of the most frightening areas in video games, alongside Shalebridge Cradle from Thief Deadly Shadows. No other game has matched the level of trepidation I felt in The Ocean House Hotel.Upon release, a significant portion of those who played it hated it because it was marred by its technical issues of which it became infamous for but the biggest cause of its demise was its release alongside Half Life 2. Luckily the game is still on sale today so bless your blood vessels by biting into this magical game like the pale lotus eater that you know you are because once you are done, you'll realise that this product, in this large market where the generic usually flourish most, is an ensemble of special silence and Troika's genuine, bittersweet farewell kiss.Mod Recommendations: Unofficial patch: http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647 "

												Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines is a RPG from publisher Activision and developed by Troika Games. For years I'd been hearing from various people about  how great this title is and now that I've played it I must totally agree. Roleplaying games are my bread and butter so this title definitely delivers with its core RPG elements. You create your character and as you progress through the game you acquire experience points which you can then distribute to many different skills and abilities thus allowing you to customize your vampire to your liking and particular style of play be that close or long ranged combat or stealth. The game is action oriented and played in either a first or third person perspective similiar to say Fallout 3 or New Vegas. Graphically the game is dated especially compared to many of the titles from recent years but with the addition of the unofficial patches by Wesp5 and various others you can update the title with high resolution textures and an abundance of bug fixes and enhancements that make it look fairly great for a game that was released so long ago. I myself am a fan of games with retro and outdated graphics and this title just has a nice style to it that fits the dark and forboding theme perfectly. Even better, the dialogue that I've been having throughout the game is one of my favorite aspects of the title as the voice acting is top notch and done so very well. Released in 2004 this game also seems to have been doing things slightly ahead of its time...things that we take for granted as they are very common place in the games of today. Pound for poind I'm loving this title and plan to spend many hours playing it so it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! P.S.-Thanks to Section Nine http://steamcommunity.com/id/Section9/ for providing the links to the patches for the game.			"

												TL;DR - you can suck blood and dance in clubs 11/10Oh Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines, you were and still are ahead of your time. You had a great soundtrack before great soundtracks were necessary.You have an incredibly absorbing world full of darkness and gothic tropes that are executed flawlessly and make you root for characters that would otherwise haunt our dreams.You have the Masquerade violations that can kill my game regardless of how powerful I think I am. No law like the Vampire law.You make vampires and other creatures of the night the terrifying, evil creatures they are instead of love-sick babies.You have a haunted house level that puts some modern horror games to shame.You have the ability to dance before dancing in clubs was cool in RPGs.You have a plot that makes my blood pressure rise and fall like I'm being drained by a hideous Nosferatu.You have a LOT...of bugs.But,You have us, dear Vampire...you have us to patch you and bring you to a new generation on Steam.R.I.P Troika and long live the Masquerade.

												Great opportunity in the Halloween sale to pick up this legendary game very inexpensively.  I highly recommend this game, at least then nobody can say you haven't played it.Upgrading your character is pretty much the same as the pen and paper RPG, which itself is very straightforward.The atmosphere of the game is excellent and not at all like the whiny vampires of recent genre pieces.Characters and story are pretty memorable, with a couple of npcs changing and upgrading depending on the choices you make within game - I can't say much more about that without spoiling the story, but good luck to you with achieving the best results!Technically, I would expect most pc to be able to handle this game; it's a bit poorly optimised which is understandable if you know the games' history.Overall, very highly reccomended!

												Bruh its a vampire game where vampires don't sparkle, buy itEdited------After the poplularity that my review has gotten I have desided to create a real review of Vampire: the masquerade Bloodlines. By far it's a classic rpg that set the standard for a new generation of rpgs, if your ok with a lot of bugs and not the best graphics due to being outdated this is like a game equal to Skyrim in how much fun and how much time you can put into it. There are a total of 8 playable vampire races that are all very different and provide a different experience that never really gets old, just don't play as a Nosferatu ♥♥♥♥ becomes impossible to play as. There are a bunch of different play styles that include, guns, melee weapons, magic. As long as your ok with a good amount of bugs drinking the blood of everyone, and a huge spike in diffculty by the end of the game and the graphics, this game is probably a 9/10 truely a masterpiece in the field of role playing games and if you are a fan of rpg games I personally recommend this game to any and everyone.

												Vampire; the Masquerade - BloodlinesBefore purchasing please note you will need to download an Unofficial Patch to fully get the game to work.Storyline, lore and depth is heavy in this game. When you first lay eyes on it, it might be an eye sore, but trust me. Start to sink your fangs into the first few victims and get lost into the twisted personal horror game that lets you cling to your humanity while witnessing unGodly, unspeakable things... or let loose and become the monster you always wanted to be all the while walking the thin red line of not breaking too many Kindred laws.The RPG element comes from the table top version of the game, point in intel, point in strength, point in charisma or melee, the concept is easy to use for beginners and easy to follow if you hover your mouse over any stat. It will tell you exactly what other stats benifit from your choices. Lacking in Hacking? Lacking in lock picking? (Dues Ex - like skills) Just add points to whatever helps you make you better at what you like doing.Game play: When you start you pick a clan, each clan has their own strengths, their own weaknesses. Adding to the replay value of the game. Brawl your way, punk your enemies into submission, lie or whisper sweet nothings into the humans' ears to manipulate them into giving you what you want. Stealth your way through the city via sewers and back alleys, stick to the shadows - or walk among the humans and other vampires as their superior. It's all up to you.Lots of side quests and though the world is not too vast (hence the game was made in 2004) you will have plenty to do with the portions of the city you have access to. Some you will need to gain specific skills, others you will get to as the game progresses.The music is awesome. 90's and early 2000's gothic/rock, dark metal music. Will be looking for the OST of this game.Voice acting, Jeanette! And many others. Even a popular actor from the TV show Futurama voice acted in this. Jeanette's voice actress did a role for Harley Quinn as well. Love her work! One of the strongest parts of this game is conversing with the NPCs. Some are funny, others will make you annoyeed, but none will be boring. Certain powers and certain social skills will effect how NPCs interact and react to you. Some you will need to threaten, if your threat is high enough, some you will have to persuade, others you have to flirt with, and some (if you pick clan Malkavian) you can just talk crazy talk with them. All adding to the depth of each NPC and some making you wish you could talk with them all night long.The game is a Horror game, and some jump scares, but the feeling I get from playing the game... CREEP FEST. The atmosphere of the game when you get into a haunted house, or exploring a mad house, or going into a den of those trying to hurry the end of the world... and the sewers! It will make you think twice about opening a manhole, in real life and in game.Over all this game is a CULT CLASSIC. If anything, get it and play it so when you nerd it out with your friends online or in person, you can give them lots of bloody tales of your own experiances in Vampire - Bloodlines.9.5 / 10 Play it! Worth every penny at full price and at 75% off. No reason not to on a big sale!			"

My Review on VTMBTl:dr Awesome game with (in my eyes) no downside, high replayability, nice characters and a dark story/atmosphere. If you are not sure if you want it, wait for a sale. If you have no problem with older games in your library and love RPG’s, get it instantly and stop reading.Now to the main part of the Review....So I was thinking that I need a new RPG to play. It should have a nice story, good gameplay and some open choices for the player. After a long time searching I found Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. I waited for a long time, before grabbing it on sale and what can I say....I love it.First things first as you may read in other reviews, this game has many bugs. Luckily there is a nice Community that fixes them and brings patches for the game. Before you play it make sure you download the latest patch found here: http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647. Now let’s start with The Review itself, why do I love this game so much? First, it is inspired by the Vampire: The Masquerade Pen and Paper, and the universe of it, a universe that is deep and complex, and instantly took a place in my heart, where Vampires live along mortal people with rules they have to keep, called the Masquerade. In that world, there are 7 playable and some more (Npc only) Clans that all play in a different way and even have a small impact on your story. The Clans are called: Brujah, Gangrel, Malkavian, Nosferatu, Toreador, Tremere and Ventrue. At the beginning you pick 1 of these, decide if you are female or male (sadly no more customization) and then you allocate your ""standard skill points"" in your character sheet, whilst every clan has his own abilities and different bonuses on some of the attributes.Then the Story starts. After a pretty, long but well-made intro sequence you can control your character. The controls feel a bit strange at first and you may have to enable mouse look in the options to get a free camera, everything else should feel similar to rpg players/source users.The graphic is also well designed and fits the dark theme of this game perfectly well, as does the synchronization. What I liked was the fighting style. You have different melee and ranged weapons that reach from a Tire Iron and a magnum to a katana and a flamethrower. While you fight in 3rd person with your melee weapons, you switch to 1st person while using your ranged firearms. Also nice : most of your attributes increase more than 1 ability, example: 1 point of dexterity will get you +1 lockpicking and +1 sneaking skill, strength will get you +1 unarmed and +1 melee and so on, so there are many different ways to design and actually play your character, which leads to the next point. The Story has to my knowledge 5 endings, that trigger with your final choice and your positioning to the factions (called sects), which are the Camarilla (the ""standard"" vampire community) the Anarchs (fighters against the Camarilla) and the Kuei-Jin (eastern vampires that are slightly different). And while you don't actively decide your standing, your actions that you make in the story ""speak"" for you.And finally The Difficulty...... I love it. The Disciplines between the clans are well balanced and with the right combination of Disciplines and weapons, even the hardest bosses turn to ash in seconds (recommandation: Flamethrower)So what can I say.... I guess the fact I recommended the game and my playtime + this review are showing it is worth playing, but again get the unofficial patch and if you are unsure get it on sale. Now excuse me while I enjoy my 2nd playthrough.			"

												This game is a cult classic.  You should be warned that this game is broken and will not function on most modern machines.  There is an Unofficial Patch made by Wesp5 that fixes nearly all issues with the game and also adds new content. Based on the board game, and sequel to Redemption, you play as a fledgling Vampire in California.  The story starts as you create your character.  Here you choose your background, bloodline, and gender.  Backgrounds change your stats slightly and your powers as a vampire will differ depending on your bloodline.  Some bloodlines have some side effects, however.  The best examples are Malkavians and Nosferatu.  Malkavians are insane and schizophrenic.  You'll talk like a crazy person, hear voices in your head and see things other people don't see.  Nosferatu are cursed in a different way as they can't be seen by humans without violating the masquerade.  This does not make it impossible to beat the game as a Nosferatu, because the main quest NPC's will still be approachable.The masquerade is a system in the game where if you get 5 bad marks it's game over and you'll be executed by your peers.  You earn bad marks by displaying certain powers in public or are seen feeding.  You can redeem yourself if you have bad marks by protecting the masquerade.  This usually involves killing someone who is speaking  too much or who isn't playing it safe like all other good little vampires should.  Graphics are decent and passable.  The game is an older game, so don't expect mind blowing visuals.  City hubs are fairly small but there's a lot to find if you set your mind to it.  There are some nice facial animations that you won't even see in games nowadays which adds to the immersion.  There's also several mods for the game to add atmosphere and even more depth to the classes.  Gameplay is basic.  You shoot things, you smash things.  You talk to people, you kill people.  There are extra dialog options if you level your seduction, intimidation, or persuassion skills.  These skills can be vital to completing some quests perfectly.  You can also recieve bonuses from certain NPC's for having them at the required level at certain points in conversation.  You gain experience from doing quests and you level up to gain strength, wisdom, guile, skill, and become more attractive.  If you're sexy enough you get free hookers! Just like IRL! =P  The beginning of the game will mostly be fetch quests, with a few baddies to either slaughter or let live.  It's a game where you can put the fate of nearly everyone around you in your hands.  Being good is rewarded with extra perks like your very own slave ghoul girl, or an extra item/money/experience.  There's also a decent but easy stealth system that's based on how many points you have in stealth.  If you max out stealth, are in the shadows and crouch you're pretty much invisible.  There are also assassinations you can do with each weapon while stealthed and behind your victim.  My favorite is the baseball bat.  :)Audio is very good as well.  Just make sure you turn Environmental Effects off or there will be a constant echo.  Voice actors are all top notch and AAA grade ones that you'll know if you've heard them before.There are some very good mods for this game available as well.  My favorite being the original Unofficial Patch Plus, but there are other that increase the difficulty of the game and add new quests and bloodlines to choose from.  When installing these big mods you need to remember that they aren't compatible with eachother.  E.G. Final Nights mod will not work with Camarilla Edition nor with either work with the Unofficial Patch.  Both mods have an Older version of the Unofficial patch that come with it, which still fixes a lot of bugs.  There's also several mods  that are still being produced constantly by fans.  Every now and then you should check up and see what new mods are out to keep you coming back for more. All in all, if you are in need of a good RPG that's open world with a lot of freedom and are tired of Fallout 3/NV, Skyrim, etc.  Then you should definately check this game out.  Especially if it's on sale.  Well worth every penny spent.			"

												Oh, Bloodlines. The epitome of ""cult classic"". This game is the most unpolished gem I've ever seem in my gaming life. It was difficult to overlook it's many bugs, and in it's time, this game suffered from incredibly poor losses (also because of a bad business launch date). However, as the time passed and the modding community adressed most of it's glaring problems, this game finally blossomed into an experiece worth of the pantheon of the best RPGs ever made.Because make no mistake: underneath that filthy layer of bugs and it's shortcomings of production/lack of content, lies one of the best RPGs ever made. Seriously. I wholeheartedly recommend you to buy it, whatever the price tag is, with a simple caveat: use the mods that fix it otherwise your experience will be undeniably disapointing.The way the IP behind this game is treated (Vampire: The Masquerade, one of the best storyteller RPGs ever) is incredible, it will plunge you down to the World of Darkness and hook you up with an engrossing mature story with all the right touches of horror and sensualization we all love about vampires. Never before or since playing a vampire character would be so cool.The mechanics are not the high point but enough to be called ""good"". The engine is the same as Half-Life 2, and it aged pretty well. The voice acting is ♥♥♥♥ing AMAZING. The story as multiple endings and the choices you make matter (to some degree), making for an incredible narrative. The Vampire Storyteller progression system is here, with slight tweaks, and it's awesome.You basically play as one of the classic Camarilla clans. I won't say much more, because the word of advice here is THIS GAME IS WORTH IT< VERY MUCH WORTH IT, JUST USE THE MODS TO FIX IT. "

												One of the best video games of all time and one of my eternal favorites.The world, story and atmosphere are unparalelled.In contrast to other known Vampire fictions, this one happens in modern day Los Angeles where by luck (bad or good) a steamy night of wild debauchery drains all of your bodily fluids and thrusts you into the world of the undead.Even though the stiffs are divided between faux-regality and anarchists, they all follow rules of the Masquerade - as a bearded man once said ""Sheep need not know that the wolf is here"". And by all of them i mean those who are not hairy beasts or necromantic golems of stolen flesh. But that's another story.A choice of 7 clans offers gameplay more diverse than any class choice in any other game ever could.You're not just picking your skills and appearance here. You're picking your unlife.For instance, as a diabolic Tremere you will often find yourself using the blood magic exclusive to your clan to explode your enemies from inside out.As a deformed Nosferatu, your non-human appearance will force you to live and travel through the sewers, as any human who sees you will surely get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ heart attack triggering 6 GTA Police stars.Meanwhile as my favorite - an insane Malkavian, you will be a spoiler spewing machine who encounters events exclusive to those not of sound mind and all of your dialogue choices will represent your twisted psyche - in a hilarious way.The game is packed with varied weapons if you think that a revolver would be a nice bonus to the vampiric powers, a lot of side-quests if you're thirsty for these, and a cast of characters that you will not forget. Like a vampire ♥♥♥♥ who sure likes to party, half of the time.Just be warned, use Wesp's Unofficial Patch. Devs meant well but they were cut short, thankfully community has carried on their legacy.The game is a must play.			"

												A game that's been both a wonderful gift and terrible curse for me. Despite the struggles it faced upon first release and the obvious flaws (lovingly patched by the ever-dedicated fans) V:TM-B wins me over time and time again. I daresay it's my favourite game. I'd also wager it's one of the most re-downloaded games out there. Sadly, there's also the greatest downside to this game - there's not much out there like it. If you're like me and end up adoring this little gem, you'll discover that soon enough. It's pretty much spoilt other RPG's for me.Of course, Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption exists. Try it. It's not the same. Eternal struggle.It's a cult classic for a reason.			"

Part of you will want to see where the story goes, even as another part will want to go back into the dark to suck blood and kill the wicked, and that mix will keep you plowing onward.Not only did Vampire: The Masquerade redefine the RPG genre but it was also one of the best RPGs back in the day and is worthy of anyone's software collection.

												A truly unique game. Even if you're not a huge fan of the vampire/werewolf mythos like me, you'll still have quite a bit of fun in this game because it immerses you into its world so effectively. Troika deserves full marks for this one, even though the game has its issues and the numerous glitches that the community has worked greatly to improve. Those same efforts only highlight how much this game is almost universally loved by those that try it. Great game, definitely recommend trying it, if you're on the fence that badly wait for a price drop but please do yourself a favor and play it at the very least.Do not play without the community-made patches, however, as the game was rushed and contains glitches galore without said patches.Here's to hoping White Wolf or someone else ""embraces"" this franchise and brings it back from the dead.

												 As a rule, when a game is so poorly made that it almost doesn't work without a fan patching it, I normally consider it a failure. When the last half of a game is just a maze with enemies that you kill while feeling lost and confused and the combat system is pretty sub-par, I consider it a waste of money... ... But the first half of this game is So Bloody Good! It has story! It has characters! It has non-violent solutions if you're a social character! It has sneaking solutions if you're a stealth character! It has hacking and knowledge solutions if you're an intelligent character! Remember how everyone praised Deus Ex for having all these things? Multiple solutions to problems that allow your character to focus on things other than shooting and stabbing? This was like that, only you drink blood! Then there's the last half of the game... You can almost feel the moment that the money runs out and Activison come knocking at the door, demanding the alpha build be put in stores tomorrow. There's a perceptible shift from multiple solutions, story focus and character driven conversations into: ""Go to this place and kill everyone. Enter this 5 x 5 room. You see 3 orcs, roll to hit the nearest one!"" This game was almost something very beautiful but, like a relationship with a shallow woman, it just needed more money thrown at it! Like heating a microwave dinner, it really needs more time than they gave it. Buy it on the cheap, patch the game, play the first half... If you reach the part where you have to start just running around and killing enemies constantly and you're invested, see it out, otherwise maybe use a cheat or something and just skip the boring, endless corridors of mooks.

												This is easily my top favorite game of all time. The atmosphere is incredible, the story is inticing. I loved just about everything in this game. My only complaints are 1) There's lots of glitches (However with Mods it is completely fixable, and there is even added content with some)2) Graphics are a bit outdated now (There are mods to help, but they can only go so far)I REALLY hope there is a VTM 2 in the future.

The atmosphere, the visuals, the characters, the music, all of those things get you right in the mood to walk on the streets of LA as one of the cursed undead. If you like vampires and/or RPGs, then you quite simply need to play this little gem.However, you must know that the game is kinda buggy and needs a bit of fixing from your part, so make sure to download the unofficial patch.

												I doubt I'll see anything else like this for as long as I live. That's the true tragedy of V:TMB. As the years pass, and the game industry grows increasingly stagnant and problematic, only the biggest most profitable game franchises can survive. This means that year after year we'll keep seeing the Elder Scrolls, the Call of Dutys, the newest Mario spin, and whatever else; probably Final Fantasy 55 at this point. Point is, a game like this wouldn't even come close to piercing the surface of mainstream interest, let alone acclaim. So, firstly, enjoyment in this game hinges entirely on how much you like vampires. This game takes after the actual role playing lore and books very closely. That means a lot of weird terminology, specifics, and politicking. Unfortunately, this is where V:TMB runs into problems. Limitations, namely. I can see the vision the creators had, and their dedication to the niddy gritty is appreciated, but the game is held back by itself in a lot of cases. This is a clunker of a game, and I don't think anyone would be able to defend that. Everything feels so... Crude. It just doesn't hold a candle to games that had their engine in better order. Even contemporary or earlier games could handle some of these problems. Inventory management is a chore. Flipping through separate pages for items is a pain. What's worse is the combat, which won't get any mercy from me. It's pretty bad. And not bad in the charming way. Just bad. Things rapidly go downhill after your first fight. Hits lack impact, and the thrill of sending enemies spinning with a three hit combo wears off fast when every enemy in the game does that. Ranged combat fares the same. None of the guns feel especially satisfying to use; aside from maybe the sniper rifle, but that's just from the sheer power of it.But let's talk about something immediate. This game won't run without a patch. It simply can't understand recent hardware enough to run without a patch. The thing is, this game hasn't been updated at all. The original creators left this game in a state, like a poor abandoned puppy. So, downloading a patch will be your first order of business if you buy this game. Which, I don't know why you would, considering its current year, but whatever.What about the rest of the game? The characters in general are very convincing for their roles. I wanted to talk to them as much as I could. Customization for the player character isn't what I'd consider modern, but it is very interesting. How you want to play will likely rest on your choice of lineage, or vampire clan. Sidequests on the whole are rewarding. The plot itself is interesting, sure, but falls short on some points. It feels like you get some real choices here. Not only with what kind of ending you want, but also how you want to play, or role play, I should say. I have yet to see another video game that legitimately lets you play an insane person; an insane person that speaks in gibberish riddles no less. Now, whether that's a result of my patch or the base game, I'm not sure, but its impressive nonetheless. This game makes big strides for player freedom, but has limits of its own to worry about. It feels like you're put on story rails, and after a while of playing the main storyline, I'll admit, it got a bit exhausting. It seems like everywhere I turned in this game, it was lacking that extra bit of grandeur it desperately needed. It's a shame.It's dated. It hasn't aged well. It tries, sure. It chugs along as well as it can. But what goes through my mind when I play this game isn't ""wow what a blast from the past,"" its more like ""what would this game look like if it was made today with twice the budget?"" This is a true role playing game. There's rolling dice for damage. There's leveling up your stat points, and spending blood points to use any one of your hereditary vampire powers. This is serious nerdery at work here, and I love it, because no other games but the most fringe nerd experiments would embark on this complete transition. Its exceptionally admirable. But apparently it wasn't made to be. Instead we get rpgs that streamline and dumb down formulas. We get games that are rpgs in name only, We get games that fail to bring anything interesting to the table at all.What I'm saying is, this game is a miracle. For every stilted exchange, there is a cool little sidequest. For every half finished stealth section, there is a piece of interesting lore shown to you. Whatever immovable objects that had to align to make this game possible, I'm thankful for them. It might not be the best or most entertaining game, but damned if its not a piece of gaming history. Unlike Fallout, its unlikely that this franchise will ever see the light of day. But for a quaint little vampire game, that's not too bad.			"

												The stronger points of the game are that it has a fantastically dark atmosphere, believable and often intense characters (something which alot of games lack), and a solid storyline that does the game justice. Also, you choose at the beginning which bloodline (faction) you are part of, which will directly affect your relationships with the characters in-game, offering variation and replayablility, if you don't mind already knowing the storyline the second time through. Finally, the level design is very well done, giving varied and interesting locations that will keep your interest, no rampant cookie-cutter design here.On the down side, it is a dated game, having been released in 2004, so you will probably only get the most out of it if you don't mind the avatars looking a bit blocky compared to what you might be used to. I'm sure it was 'fairly' close to cutting edge graphics in 2004, but if you can look past it, the game will suck you in and you won't notice.It was mentioned that the game doesn't feel finished by one reviewer, and while I disagree, I can see why that might come up. The game is completely set at night, so far as I can remember, so you won't get the bustling city feel that daytime would bring, and also it doesn't have a huge amount of side quests that seem to pack into games these days (to cover up lack of original content), but there is plenty to keep you occupied.. you won't get bored.Also, apparently the game was quite buggy at release. I'd used the official patch when I played it, and didn't come across any problems. I certainly didn't come close to checking on forums, as one or two others had, but everyone plays a game differently, and it's becoming standard practice to check forums rather than think a problem through, or work around it. Regardless, apparently the unofficial patch made by fans is the best, from what I gather.Overall I greatly enjoyed the game and thought it to be underrated, definately a pleasant surprise. At no point did I get bored, even though there are many areas, nor did I question whether I'd see it through to the end, unlike quite a few games which get churned out. The storyline was interesting, and I found myself carefully watching the behaviour of all the characters, not quite sure who to trust, as it should be in a vampire underworld. The hotel level was especially spooky, I might add ;) good job on that. I only wish that there was a sequel.			"

Initial Note: Don't be fooled by my game time as shown by Steam. I own the boxed version and have completed it in excess of 5 times, so spent a fair few hours in this one.A flawed but o-so beautiful gem. A game that is pure genius, oozes atmosphere and drags you in. If it wasn't for the bugs, clunky combat and lackluster final stretch of the game, it would be a masterpiece.... well, to be honest, it IS a masterpiece, in-spite of that. An RPG at heart, built on the original Source engine, it is a game like no other. I have not played a game that pulled me in quite like this since, and I doubt I ever will do again. Its characters, story and the adult way in which it plays out is simply gaming gold. If you try it, I would highly recommend getting hold of the community patch - which fixes 95% of what was wrong with the game at launch. Please, developers - give us more games like this.

I recommend playing this game with a non history made character as it makes sense since your'e an average person, newly ""embraced"".

												I hate vampires, but I absolutely love this game.This game is a classic RPG. You choose a clan and your starting stats, and choose how to build your character as you go. The world is interesting and fun to explore, and you will meet plenty of interesting characters along the way. Considering I've stuck with mostly fantasy RPGs, and some post-apocalyptic RPGs, this one is a breath of fresh air, and tempts me to behave in a way I don't normally in other games. Replay value is high, since clan choice highly effects dialogue, playstyle, and vampiric abilities.Grab the unofficial patch, and enjoy!			"

												I've just completed my first playthrough, and all I can say is consider me a parrot. Anything positive or negative you see in someone else's review is no doubt something I will also be saying.In short:-It has its share of flaws, primarily in the combat - but it doesn't matter. There's nothing else like it, especially in todays market. I found the combat a bit clumsy but enjoyable, and only the occasional bugs made me swear in anger. I got this bug a few times where I couldn't change weapons or couldn't change my view from third to first person. It got annoying, but reloading usually fixed it.-Class variety is excellent. (I've watched other people let's play classes besides the one I chose, and the actual storylines and character to character interactions vary drastically with some classes; The gameplay experience will also be very unique with some character types.)-Multiple outcomes for missions/multiple ways to approach missions (think Deus Ex but a bit dialed back in some cases) plus multiple endings.-Great story, great characters, great voice acting.-------------------------------If you do want to get this game, make sure to download and install the Unofficial Patch. It's a simple google search and drag and drop install, and it fixes many issues with the game and even adds missing quest lines and balances combat for the better. There is no reason not to experience this title. I waited many years, always thinking to myself it would be too dated, too cheesy, not worth it, etc. I was wrong. From start to finish, you will be under this games spell - like a devilishly handsome vampire seducing you with his cold stare. Embrace the night, uphold the masquerade, and as many others have said before me - do not open it.			"

Product received for free
												Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is the best half game ever. I love this game, everyone should. It reminds me a lot of Deus Ex and if given more development and money this could have been even better. It pains me when I see all the wasted potential of this hidden gem.The writing is top notch, the stat system is robust and the choice of clans is a really great addition with some clans in particular pretty much changing the entire gameplay. The combat takes a lot of getting used to and that is not an understatement but it's fine enough considering this is an RPG and not a standard action game. The graphics are really good for the time considering the engine it is using the feel of the game is not like anything else you'll see. For those of you unaware, this takes place in a modern Los Angeles setting with hidden clan of vampires. It's like Angel but with nosferatu.However all that comes with a problem. The development is incredibly depressing to read about and I'll save you the details of what game came out the same day, but the point is this is clearly unfinished. The longer the you play the game the less freedom you get until finally you end the game with one of the most disappointing final missions I've played. It really is a shame since I do love this game so much.You need to play this if you love WRPGs. In fact many people consider it one of their favourites let alone favourite games of all time and I can understand why for the most part but it just slips out of that for me due to its diminishing quality over the game. This game still has fan patches being made constantly and for your sake get it immediately. Bloodlines might not be perfect but it'll be hard to find a game as rewarding, fun and memorable as this. Rest in peace Troika, you will be missed.			"

												This game is like wine; the more it ages, the better it's getting.Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines truly is a unique hidden gem among games that for some reason never loses its charm no matter how much you play it. It doesn't strike me as surprising to see that even to this day that there is an active community still creating patches, mods, and content despite its release in 2004. With that being said, the replay-value is tremendous and upholds alot of unique writing mixed with extensive vocabulary and a passion for extravagant settings, atmosphere and level-design. Admittedly, considering that this game has been overseen by many, there still is no game that comes even remotely close to what this game is offering you despite how much it has aged over a decade. Now, it would be unfair if I wouldn't mention its disastrous state when being released with its horrendous bugs and glitches that more likely scared people off from buying it, however, I could talk about how the developers struggled creating this game based on the Source-Engine when the engine itself still was being developed. Also this game is extremely unpolished, unfinished and it doesn't take a genius to see where exactly they struggled developing the game when in its initial state is almost unplayable without the patches, that gladfully fixed and added alot of content throughout the game. But I'd like to keep that aside for now, since there's more to this game than meets the eye.You're starting off as a fellow kindred - a newborn vampire so to speak, and suddenly your fate will be met with a hidden vampire society called ""Camarilla"", that have a strict code of conduct they must obey in order to survive and uphold the masquerade that serves as a protection from humanity finding out about the existence of vampires within their society. As soon as you leave the meeting, you are on your own without anyone to rely on or trust, except a vampire called ""Jack"" that simply teaches you the basics of your new life as a kindred. Now, if that alone isn't less of any help, you will be put out there all alone by yourself and any wrong move disturbing the masquerade such as violently exhibiting agressive behaviour may even lead to your immediate execution - of course, after breaking the masquerade a several times understandably. Anyhow, you are pretty much relying on yourself without any explanations as to why you became a creature of darkness, but these answers you will have to deliever yourself, which makes this game so unique in the first place. There absolutely is no hand holding you, telling you to go there and do this - no annoying quests that play out the same repetitive cycle that is: gathering, combat, exploration and boring dialogue. Every quest in this game is incredibly unique and well-thought giving you alot of choices how to respond and thus change the outcome. Oh, have I also mentioned the dialgoue choices? There's plenty. And I mean plenty to choose from. From seducing to intimidating that perfectly well suits all your roleplay needs at once. This is all about you being you.I could also talk about the graphics and performance of this game, you know, the technical side of things! But there really isn't much to see here except outdated graphics and a stable framerate. Make no mistake, this game still has some pretty aspects when it comes to graphics but overall it's a fairly ugly game, but that shouldn't keep you from playing it as when it comes to characters you have facial expressions you've never seen before except in Half-Life 2 and some other exceptional games, even to this very day many games lack fluid animations and facial expressions - and VTMB gives you exactly what the games nowadays are missing, not only technically. Anyway, you are more likely to ignore the ugly graphics once you indulge into this masterpiece and I can assure you that it will be that way.The soundtrack you may ask? Well, generally the soundtrack is pretty much mediocre or at least decent to a certain scale. Many of the voice clips are re-cycled especially when it comes to fighting, but that only goes for cops or generic enemies you will have to deal with from the beginning. The voice acting in this game really is good! I mean it's nothing groundbreaking but all of the voice actors or at least partially some are known roles in games that come out these days, or memoreable games that people adore. So in that aspect I can only say that I enjoyed the soundtrack as well as the voice acting.The storyline of this game is very well-written and that goes for side-quests as well. Never have I felt so indulged and motivated to look around and eventually come across a random character that may fill me in a quest that has a particular humour, charme and dialogue that's going to keep you busy for a decent amount of time. So, all I can really say without spoiling is that this game and all quests in it are memoreable all the way from the beginning to the ending. Although the game slighty gets weaker when it comes to the storyline near the ending of the game I must say.Now that I covered pretty much every topic I wanted to talk about, with all of that being said, this game is a must and you shouldn't miss out on playing it. It may be old and look crappy but don't judge this book by its cover, not this one. Don't ask yourself once, or twice, but play it immediately when you have the chance to. But please download the latest unofficial patch so that this experience is worthwhile and won't get interrupted by hasty bugs and annoying glitches.			"

												There's only one reason to give this game a poor review:IT DOES NOT WORK WITHOUT ONE OF THE UNOFFICIAL PATCHES YOU WILL HAVE TO DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL.Now, this isn't a great hindrance, as you can find the guides to help you right here on Steam.  There are even guides that will aid you in getting the graphic-enhancing mods to work that come with one of the patches (I chose Wesp's Unoffical Patch since it seemed to contain more goodies).Yeah, yeah, I know the game's developer's are out of business.  I know it 'only takes five minutes to install the patch'.  Doesn't really matter.Someone is asking people to fork over $20 for a decade-old game (as of the time of this writing, you can get it for $5 though!), and someone is getting that money.  That 'someone' could at least update it with a patch of their own that is included in the purchase.  Whoever is getting paid for this game is relying on the cult status this game has achieved to put money in their pockets and giving their fans the middle finger as they do it.Which is a shame because, what I've played so far, it's a great game.  Not top-notch, but pretty good for its niche.Graphics:  They're a decade old and even with enhancements, it shows its age.  Animations are kind of stiff and clunky, and everything is sort of reminiscent of the way the original Blood Rayne looked.Voice-Acting:  Some of it is Grade A, some of it is Grade F.  Pretty hit or miss, as usual with most games, your protagonist stays silent.  Nothing wowing here, except for how terrible some of it is.Gameplay:  Pretty basic.  Forces you into third-person view whenever you do melee fights, which I find irritating.  I'd like it a lot more if I didn't have to see my own character's awkward flailing strikes.  There are some nice elements, such as your ability to be a silver-tongued rascal, or computer-hacking nerd, or lockpicking sneak really coming into play.  I also like how faithful they are to the source material, with Nosferatu having to stay hidden from humans, the rivalry war between Sabbat and Camarilla, etc.Story:  It's nothing to sneeze at, but it's not quite as great as some people claim.  Your dialogue choices are often clunky and ridiculous, but the whole thing weaves together fairly well.TL;DR:  Get it while it's on sale.  KNOW YOU WILL HAVE TO MANUALLY PATCH IT TO GET IT TO WORK.  DO NOT IGNORE ALL THE REVIEWS TELLING YOU THIS, THINKING IT WILL WORK ON YOUR RIG.If whoever is making money off of selling this game would patch it themselves, I would give it a positive recommendation.

												...A Note about old games needing patching.The game is not broken.  You can install it on an old XP machine and play it fine(as fine as back in 2004 at least).  WHining about ""selling broken games"" is dumb.  I own music on Vinyl that never got converted to digital.  Should I be able to get these albums FREE, or for like $2, because they won't load, as-is, to my Ipod??  No, because I know they are vinyl records, and if I want to play them in digital format, they need to be ripped and converted.  The game wasn't meant to play on a 32 GB Win 10 machine.  ""But GOG sells it patched?!"" SO Buy it there.  GOG isn't 1/50th the size of Valve.  My mom used to cut the crust off my bread.  SO therefore any restaurant that doesn't is terrible?Nobody forced you to buy the game.  Go try to play your Super Mario Bros 3 NES cart on your wii U, as-is.  Go try to play your copy of Parappa the Rapper for PS1 on your PS4.  As-is.  You can't   That doesn't mean nobody should sell these items.  Old Code isn't useless, and isn't without monitary value.  Giving a bad review to a game because it doesn't play as-is on your new machine just means you are ignorant, and don't understand media, and how it works.  Flame on.  I'm Ready for my 12% recommended review score.  Just please take what you just read into consideration.			"

												This is by far the best Vampire game I've ever played! Even still, many, many years after it's release, I still play through it once every couple years. When released, it was an utter mess, but after so many years, the community has fixed most of the problems with the game.Sure, the UI is really old, and some of the mechanics might be a bit frustrating at times, but the storyline is absolutely fantastic, and a lot of the features in the game were really groundbreaking at the time. If you're an RPG fan, or a Vampre fan, this game is a must play for you! Give it at least an hour or two, once you have acclimated to the antequated parts of the game, you will be able to appreciate it for what it was... what it still is. The best Vampire RPG ever made.This game despirately needs a sequal!			"

												Probably one of the finest RPG's out there. The characters are not only memorable, but just damn well done. I cannot remember any NPC's in Fallout 4. I played this game a year or two back, and vividly remember every chilling moment. The storyline is beyond excellent, with the pacing of the original Deus Ex. You have plots within conspiracies within plots. Bonus points for having each 'sub-race' of vampires having different experiences. (The insane one is especially fun. Same with the sewer noseferatu types.)Truly no other game out there does Vampires as well as this one. You really feel like you are just a person in this beautiful dark world....that being said... the UI takes more than a little getting used too. Also some areas are downright brutal for certain builds.This game and the original Deus Ex hold a special place in my heart......and I played them both for the first time within the last five years. That should say something. An ageless classic.			"

												A deep RPG whose strengths are able to overcome its various flaws.You start by picking one of seven vampire clans, which have their own advantages and disadvantages, slightly different starting stat upgrade choices, and 3 different special powers (some of which are unique to certain clans, others can be found among multiple clans).  Dialogue choices and NPC dialogue can change depending upon the clan you choose.  Especially interesting is the freakish looking Nosferatu clan who are suppose to stay in the shadows.  If you choose them, some NPCS will refuse to speak to you and may even freak out if you attempt to, others will comment on how hideous looking you are.  There're even unique events that happen if you choose the Nosferatu.  Sorry old woman working at the diner...As a vampire living in a normal society, you have to keep your existence hidden.  If you start sucking blood out on the main streets or use certain special powers, people will notice and you'll get 'masquerade' violations.  As you start getting more and more, vampire hunters will randomly show up to kill you.  If you get too many violations, you'll be executed by the vampire clans.  You earn experience by completing quests and use that experience to choose how to upgrade your character.  You can choose to spread experience around or focus in certain areas.  How you build your character will change how you'll be able to complete quests.  You can choose to focus on social skills, which will make it easier to talk, seduce, or intimidate your way into certain areas.  You could focus on stealth, lockpicking, and hacking to make your way around.  Or you could just beat the crap out of everyone in your way.The dialogue choices in the game are deep, and there're plenty of interesting & likeable characters throughout the game who will react to you based on how you talk to them.  If you insult some enough, they won't bother talking to you anymore or give you their sidequests.  The game also has several different endings, some of which will only be available if you've stayed friendly with certain major characters.The game has four major areas you can travel between and freely explore or ignore.  The game finds a sweet point on area size.  Areas are large enough that there're plenty of unique places that you'll want to explore.  However, areas are never so large that you feel like it'll take forever to find/complete all the quests and they can all be completely traversed within a minute or two.On the downside, the game has several bugs even with the ""Unofficial Patch"" installed.  I didn't run into anything game breaking, but there was a time or two where I had to change up my choices so the game wouldn't get stuck.  Stealth isn't the game's strongsuit.  Sometimes enemies won't notice you even if you're right in front of them.  Sometimes if they see you or hear you, they'll get stuck in search mode and just stand staring at a spot you need to walk through to get by.  Sometimes you can get them out of being stuck, other times you can't.  For the most part, combat is alright, but don't expect to be blown away.I went into the game worried that it might be overhyped and not that good.  Was very pleasantly surprised by how much I ended up enjoying it.  If you like deep RPGs, you'll like this game.			"

												Nominated this game for ""Test of Time"" award! Do you want to know what is the greatest hidden gem that was harshly buried due to its rushed release, lack of sales, and bugs in the history of gaming? Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines is it. I had this game standing alone in the backlog two years ago. I kept having strange sudden urges saying I need to play this game over and over again. I decided why the heck not. The game kept crashing and crashing. I found out it required community patches. Already had 300 of them... Wow, the community must be sooo dedicated. I wonder why? Hmm... Now it finally ran smooth at the start. Boom, my life changed when I put my foot in the city of Santa Monica and met a memorable character named Smiling Jack. The atmosphere and the characters in the game were something I have never seen or experienced before in any games that blown me away. They were soooo freaking immersing that kept me hooked playing this game nonstop for two weeks. The story became remarkably darker, mind blowing, and emotional all at the same time. It was sooo well written and properly executed that I couldn't believe how good the whole thing is. The characters. The atmosphere and places to explore. The gameplay and RPG elements chosen for this game. The plot. EVERYTHING. So good. I do not want to spoil ANYTHING because you need to play this first.The experience inspired me to complete few playthroughs with different clan and mods. The community and cult following are so dedicated that it's amazing. This game is a textbook example of a cult classic. Excellent cult classic. I am proud to claim this game as my third favorite game of all time. 9.7 out of 10			"

												Reading through the negative reviews here, most of them have the same complaint: they can’t get the game running. It’s true the game won’t run on a modern OS without the unofficial patch, which is shameful on Activision’s part, especially since the creator of the patch offered it to them for free.But despite the annoyance of getting the game running, it has a 94% approval rating here on Steam. Indeed it seems nearly everyone that actually managed to play the game liked it. That speak volumes of the game.Apart from getting the game running is it flawless? Not entirely, the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. While the combat isn’t quite as clunky as the first Deus Ex, enemies with fully automatic weapons will kill you in about two seconds, though these enemies mostly appear towards the end of the game and thankfully stealth is preposterously easy.So why play this game? Simple: Atmosphere and Characters. This game has such wonderful way of making you feel like a creature of the night. The graphics are obviously dated, but there are nice touches such as animated facial expressions. The original soundtrack is great. The licensed music ranges from pretty good to really awful.What really keeps me coming back to this game is the characters. Though most of them are clinically dead they are more alive the character in any other game I’ve played. The dialogue is brilliantly written and voice acted. It’s just a delight to talk to people in this game. The Vampire Politics at the heart of the game are also really fascinating and how you treat the different factions affects which endings are available to you.Despite the problems with getting it running and the rather poor gameplay this is a must play if you like good writing in games. If, however, you only care about gameplay this game is not for you.			"

												This game has got a lot of flaws, but I forgive almost every single one of them because I am so enamored with its world, and its writing. Seriously, it takes a lot to get me to give a ♥♥♥♥ about ♥♥♥♥ing Vampires. Set in the World of Darkness RPG universe, this game had writing and design that was just too ambitious. The developers clearly had a magnificent vision for this game -- a game where the experience is vastly different depending on which clan you picked. A game where playing it through once only shows you a fraction of what it has to offer. A world filled with choices, and so, so many ways to solve your problems. If this game had been allowed to finish, it could have been right up there alongside revered greats such as Deus Ex and Planescape: Torment. Unfortunately, its flaws, and the fact that the game is literally not finished, rob it of such a reward. It's almost tragic, really.If you're gonna buy this game, be prepared to do some homework just to get the damn thing to run. The unofficial patch is basically mandatory. But this game is well worth the effort. If you're a fan of dynamic RPGs with loads of replay value, give this a shot. I put off trying it out for a long time and honestly wish I had played it sooner.			"

												I love this game. Absolutely adore this game. For an older game released in the early 2000's, I expected less. I expected something easy and fun and fluffy. Instead I found myself so enthralled by the story and the plot and the style that I replayed the game over and over again going through as much as I possibly could and making as many changes as I could just so the game would not end. This is a fantastic vampire game. We need more games like this nowadays. It reminded me of the style of American McGee's Alice and reminded me of the world of Rice's vampires, such as Lestat and Louis. It took me a little bit to figure out how to run the old game on a newer computer, but I will never, ever regret making this purchase and I envy all who have yet to discover its brilliance, because I just want to go through and re-descover everything all over again. The graphics were good for the time, a little shaky now, but it hardly takes away from gameplay. I fell in love with so many characters I was ashamed with myself. 10/10 all the way.			"

												One of my all time favourite RPGs. As apposed to most role–playing games, Bloodlines offers a more diverse approach to the platform, creating near unique scenarios for each different Clan, outfitted with bespoke abilities and skills. One of the more enjoyable qualities of Bloodlines is that – and unlike most other games of the same genre – content transcends the battle front, development and progression is key to successs. Having said that, combat is equally as awesome as storyline content, and one of the funnest aspect of the game for me so far has been trying out different Clans, and seeing how they work differently with dialogue and the eventual endgame, there's to say it's a very redoable game as long as you broaden your horizons for each new character and select a different Clan for your playthrough.100% recommendable for RPG fans.

												Okay, so I started playing this game about two years ago and only made it to the second location because the game is buggy as Hell and wasn't loading something that was an intergral part of one of my missions (so, I quit instead of starting over).I recently replayed the game, all the way through, this time, and let me tell you: this game is fantastic. I's an old game, sure, but it definitely holds up well. And in some ways, is vastly superior to some modern games. The graphics are a bit dated, but not horribly so. Again, I've played some modern games with worse. Voice acting is top-notch. The story and lore that surrounds the game is amazing and deep. You could spend hours just talking to NPCs because the lore is that involved and you may want to absorb it all. I hesitate to say characters are believable (I'm looking at you, Knox), but they're charming. Some are likeable, whereas others are easy to hate. Either way, they're all written well for the world they are in and really help to develop it. I found the Anarchs to be a much more relatable, realistic group than some of the others. That said, the members of the Anarchs are my favorite chraracters, so I could be biased. Combat (especially melee) can be a bit clunky, but not impossible to handle. And, due to the various clans, it makes it very easy to find a playstyle that works best with what you like. This game transitions from a stealth/puzzle game, to a 3rd person hack and slash, to a 1st person shooter seamlessly, and allows the player to change up their playstyle on the fly.  Each clan has a very unique, rich story that surrounds them, which makes it fun to play multiple times in order to get a feel for all seven of them.Some the levels are unsettling, or downright scary to go through. They're very atmospheric, with great audio and visuals. I would be lying if I said that there weren't some missions where I had to take my headphones off, or had to play during daylight hours while other people were around. There's one in particular where you don't even face any enemies, but the hair on the back of my neck still stands up every time I go through it. My one main complaint is that VTMB is a game that hinges on the fact that your character might be a sexual creature, making it possible to sort of romance some of the characters. However, there is only one male NPC throughout the game who can be 'romanced', yet several females. I get that at the time, game companies thought  that female gamers were a rarety, so I don't really fault it too much.			"

												Probably the best (and probably the only) Vampire-based RPG, game is character and story driven and is very charming,graphics surpirisingly good. Animations are weird, and EXTEREMLY glitchy and dated (AND JESUS CRISTO THE WARRENS WERE GOD AWFUL). Still, very fun and has a lot of redeeming qualities.			"

												A masterpiece within the genre of RPG, this is up and maybe above even Baldurs gate :) I played this many years ago, and bought it instantly when i found it here a few months ago. It has an amazing storyline, and it is very flexible regarding which clans you choose, skills, abilities, and much more. It has a great replay value, you'll find yourself restarting coming half way through just to see what would happen if you made some different choices, or if you choose another type of vampire to play. It is one of the best games ever made in my world.  The graphics is still ok, although the game is old, the music and atmopshere is amazing, the storyline has many twists in it.  Best buy you can do if you like RPG and FPS, Join the dark side ;)			"

												Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines is a simply sublime title by Troika. It was the third and final title they ever made before kicking the bucket.You play as a newly formed vampire in a ""World of Darkness"". You choose between several clans, from the rebellious Brujah to the insane Malkavians. Each clan has their own stat differences and NPCs react to you very differently. Especially if the player plays as a Nosferatu, you are treated like a hideous monster and cannot stay around human NPCs without them running away from you. The gameplay is solid and acts as both a first person shooter and a hack and slash.Most notable is the atmosphere of VtmB. It features very well made map design that is riddled with side quests in it's city hubs. Believe me when I say this game takes a while to complete, and is very rewarding once you do it. It is also replayable due to how much of the game changes depending on what clan you play as.It runs on a beta version of the Source engine. The version it runs on is actually more primitive than Half Life 2. As a result the game is fairly buggy due to it's rushed development. However like all of Troika's games there is a large fan community that has released an unofficial patch that fixes most of the issues.			"

												In a way this game (when you manage to run it with the unofficial patch) reminds me about Bathesda's Elder Scrolls series. It has small, more compact world because of the source engine I presume, but lots of content. I am mentioning Elder Scrolls for the solo purpose of saying that just like TES, VTM:B must be loved with all its flaws, bugs, errors and imperfections.I honestly believe that Troika Games just had horrible luck as if universe screwed them up while they were creating the game.Starting with engine itself, Troika used an unfinished Source Engine and had to work with it, adding their own code. Troika worked on the same engine that Half-Life 2 were even before the engine was shown publicly. In fact they had an agreement that they can't sell the game before the Half-Life 2 release.After the engine came Activision. Even though Troika employers kept on working overtime on the game, Activision still rushed the release and cut off sponsorship of the game. So in the end we got ourselves a rushed, unpolished product that in fact was fixed and updated by fans for more than 11 years now.And you might think thats it? Troika Games sold too little copies of the game to keep up afloat and ended up being closed. How did that happen if the game is so good as I keep on saying?Bad luck.Release date of the game is November 2004. What else happened in 2004 prior the November?Unreal Tournament 2004, Far Cry, Sacred, Painkiller, Hitman: Contracts, Manhunt, Thief: Deadly Shadows,  Doom 3, Silent Hill 4: The Room, Sims 2, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War, Star Wars: Battlefront, Myst IV: Revelation, Rome: Total War and many other awesome games. Year 2004 was an amazing year in the industry.And you may think that with all that competition on the market VTM:B were safe since they released in November, while other games were earlier? Well, still bad luck Troika Games.What happened in November in the PC game industry? (I am not mentioning games such as MGS3 and other console games since I am talking about PC)CS:Source, Half Life 2, NFS: Underground 2, World Of Warcraft, Prince Of Persia: Warrior Within and so on. With all respect to Troika Games, they had no chance of wining a competition.Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is probably one of my favorite games of all time. With all it's imperfections and glitches it delivers an amazing lore, story, humor and experience. Gameplay itself (fighting) is done horribly and sloppy though so don't expect to be blown away with it, dialoges is what makes it so special. Depending on the vampire clan you chose it can take you 3 or more walkthroughs to experience all the game aspects such as different approaches (stealth, fighting with magic or brute force, persuation/intimidation/seduction) and even a special, Malkavian clan walkthorugh. You see, Malkavians are insane vampires. And by insane I mean totally sick. When you play as a Malkavian character literally every dialogue line for you is changed in a mad/insane way. In fact you can have a dialog with a news reporter on your TV if you are playing as a Malkavian.All and all, when playing this game keep in mind that it was released in 2004 and it has lots of flaws that modern games don't, but thats simply because people are always becoming better at what they do and creating videogames is not an exception.

												   Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is very likely my favorite RPG of all times. The game has not aged well, but It still has style and grace if you look past the silly animations and poor graphics. The tone this game sets, the amount of things you can do outside the main storyline, the choices you make as the player and as a vampire. All of these things together lend to not only a great game, but a game with a large amount of replayability. Only advice, Get a mod to play along side it. If not just the standard Unofficial commutiy patch, Clan Quest Mod is quite good.			"

												I have waited a decade and change to play this game. I still have an ancient Bradygames walkthrough guide along with written notes in it to deal with each clan character. But in the end, perhaps it was a blessing in disguise to wait this long, where I can now play the game with all the bugs fixed. Due to that, I can say, without a doubt, that Bloodlines is one of the most underrated, underappreciated RPGs you have never heard of.Your beginning is straightforward enough. In Los Angeles, you are changed into a vampire against your will, which ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the local vampiric powers-that-be enough to kill them outright. You, on the other hand, are spared with the understanding that you will contribute to Kindred (as these vampires call themselves) society or else. From there, it becomes a tangled web of politics, competing agendas and choices that are eventually going to ♥♥♥♥ SOMEBODY off enough to take a shot at you.Prior to this intro, you get to create your character from scratch with the aid of a simplified but true-to-the-source White Wolf character sheet. Picking one of seven clans will likely have the biggest effect on your gameplay, as each has their own unique strengths and weaknesses. After that, though, anything goes. Just be careful to note violate the Masquerade (an honor system where you do nothing too stupid too often to tip off the mortal herd that vampires are real) and you can be whatever kind of character you want: brawler, socialite, hacker, thief, assassin, gunfighter. Just always account for the fact that sooner or later, you're going to have to fight and you'll find unique playthroughs each time you pick a different clan.One other important note: getting the latest fan-made patch for this game (9.7 at the time of this writing) is an absolute MUST or you're going to have the dubious joys of running into all those bugs the original game came with. But with that accomplished, have fun!			"

												One of the best RPGs I have ever played. If you are a fan of VtM, or simply want an easy introduction into the World of Darknessm this is the game to play. Though I have to point out that it is old, and without the fanmade patches it's nearly unplayable. Yet I find myself playing it again every year trying to capture the essence of what i felt the first time playing it. The games atmosphere and setting is deeply immersive, and the voiceacting is fantastic. The NPCs are fleshed out, which makes the gameworld come alive in a way that no other RPG has managed after it in my opinion.I can't recommend this game enough, dispite the games age, it still will give you an RPG experience that you will not find anywhere else.P.S: Play it with the newest fanpatch for the most optimal experience.

												BEAT! 35 hoursThe elevator pitch for this game:It is Deus Ex, but with vampires in a 90's LA setting.Game is good.There are some cons:- The enemy AI has some superhuman/ olympic level reaction and accurary. It gets so ridiculous that it is almost funny. Almost.  Only it's not.- You can get health by feeding, blood bags, or just waiting. Problem is options a and b are often NOT options and waiting takes FOREVER. I have watched youtube series just waiting for my health to climb back up.  I would even guess 3-5 hours or so of my playtime is just me waiting.Neutral- Not as open in some regards (in level design) as something like thief 2 or something.  It is from 2004, so thats expected.  Just expect segments to be a bit more linear in regards to certain sections of levels.			"

The graphics, gameplay, and soundtrack are top notch, and although it is a product of it's time, it's also a classic.			"

												Hands down, the best game I've ever played. It's dark and gritty without taking itself too seriously, filled with atmopshere and world-detail without playing like a fantasy encyclopedia. and you can roll around town dressed up as a pimp or a stripper. What more could you want from a game?The best testimony of how fantastic this game is is undoubtedly the fans; Even though this game came out in 2004, there are still unofficial patches being developed and released as you read this. Never has a game been more loved, cherished, or enriched by its community. We're just lucky to be able to play it now, when all the bugs have been fixed by dedicated fans, compared to its initial release.The game play is fairly simple and easy to access, though the variety of levels mean it never gets dull. You can shoot, tear, or bite your way through your enemies, and look like something straight out of a bondage fever dream/nightmare whilst doing it. The plot is genuinely gripping, with twists and turns I never saw coming, and the ending? The ending is just... f*** me. Well played, Bloodlines. Well played.Storyline? Basically, you wake up a fledgling after a passionate night with your fanged lover, only to end up becoming a glorified slave of a grumpy french nobleman with a Napoleon complex and a damn nice suit. Be his ♥♥♥♥♥ for what feels like eternity. Blow ♥♥♥♥ up. The ranges of choices you're given are actually pretty impressive, and DO make a difference, unlike some franchises I can think of (*cough*Mass Effect*cough). Be sassy. Be crazy. Be sexy as hell. It's one of those games where you can truly be whoever you want. Aside from appropriately dressed. No mod will ever give you that.			"

												Bloodlines is a great rpg, it has a very awkward tutorial that does a poor job of introducing the game to you and it can be quite a turn off for newcomers but the tutorial does not represent the game well at all. Once you are left to explore the first area of the game after the tutorial you start to see the strengths of the game and you start to understand why this game has such a cult following. It has an interesting story and world, interesting lore and interesting characters with also very surprisingly great voice acting. I absolutely loved exploring the open world hub areas without the burden of objective markers, soaking in the world and atmosphere from just talking to npcs and discovering side missions which by the way are very well done and tell great stories on their own and end up being very memorable. The ideologies of the different vampire factions I found very intriguing in particular. The main missions offer up nice variety with the visuals and locations you are visiting and you can tell the developers tried to make an effort to make each mission feel different from each other so the game doesn’t get repetitive. However you can tell the developers ran out of either time or money because the level design in the later stages become really generic and repetitive especially compared to the early missions like the amazing ocean house hotel. The rpg mechanics are implemented to the game very well, I appreciated the amount of options in the character creation and the leveling up system. I really liked the morality system with the humanity and being faithful to the masquerade, it’s well integrated with the main and side missions in particular. I appreciated all the different ways you can tackle an objective even though I always ended up just going in guns blazing. Speaking of the combat I enjoyed it overall I don’t think it’s horrible like some people claim, it does it’s job perfectly fine in my opinion and it can be pretty fun at times. The end game can be very brutal if you haven’t leveled up your character in a few certain ways which does restrict the freedom you have with your character. I recommend installing the fan made unofficial patch of the game because without it it’s almost unplayable with all the bugs, crashes and lack of high resolution options.8/10 (Great)			"

												Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is considered one of the classic PC RPGs. I've seen nothing but positive things about it, but to be honest, the cover art and the concept kind of warded me off of it. After all, vampires suck now. Now, after 30 hours and having beaten the game, I can safely say it's one of the best games I've ever played.It has a unique atmosphere, gothic without feeling forced, gritty and stylish. It takes what the modern take on the modern vampire is and makes it well... good. Great. Apparently, this is the norm for VTM (which I haven't played at Tabletop before). I would say its the best depiction of a modern vampire out there. It's not all rosy, of course. This game doesn't pull any punches if you're not being careful and keeping aware. I couldn't even get the game to run on Steam. However, VTM-B has a very active, very devoted fanbase that creates custom content and mods so I was able to get a 'true to game' patch that simply made the game run in no time at all. I only beat the game a few hours ago, but I am already thinking of second play throughs, with new mods and new choices. This game gives the player a ton of opportunities to alter the story, too. I felt like, at most every juncture, that my decisions mattered. That I wasn't just plodding through the developer's story but that I was writing a story of my own.Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines manages to hold together a beautifully crafted environment, with some satisfying combat and evocative NPC interaction and story telling. It borders on perfection and a standard that other RPGs should be held to. Pros:+Amazing Atmosphere+Cool and gothic without feeling forced+Likeable/multidimensional NPCs+Lots of choices and approaches to both build and story progression+Satisfying, high-impact combat (at least in melee)+Active fanbase producing extra content+Very addictive once things get goingCons:-The first half hour or so of the game are slow and fail to grab attention-The unmodded/unpatched game was not playable for me (but this is not such a big issue)-Character building and numbers can be unintuitiveOverall, I would say it's completely worth the purchase, even at non-sale price.

Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines is an action role-playing game, developed by Troika Games and released in 2004. Overshadowed by other landmark releases such as Half-Life 2 and crippled by a rushed development, this criminally underrated Source game is a faithful interpretation of the popular table top classic and an enjoyable - albeit pulpy - romp through the World of Darkness.Presented in both third- and first-person perspective, the gothic reimagining of Los Angeles features a tumultuous social and political landscape between the various factions of vampires vying for control. You assume the role of the unnamed protagonist thrown into this violent underbelly and join the clan of your choice before being literally let loose in to the new (and often strange) world. But what happens next is up to you.The game world is the centrepiece of Bloodlines as it constantly invites the player to really explore the depths of what it has to offer. With the incredible variety of methods and playstyles available within this sandbox-like environment, replay value is immense, as is the sheer enjoyment of exploration. There are plenty of unique abilities to use (and abuse) on the unsuspecting citizen, ranging from the seductive bloodsucking of the Toreador to the animalistic brute strength of the Nosferatu or Gangrels. Each clan has its own particular style and the variety of outfits available to the player reflects this. Despite associating yourself with a particular clan at the beginning of the game, there isn’t content that is locked off to the player due to the constant political in-fighting of the Camarilla that forms the basis of the game’s narrative. Revealing your presence to the human population results in Masquerade point deductions, which can result in failing the game entirely and your activities depend on keeping up this secrecy. Outside of that however, your journey actively encourages as much havoc as possible and those interested in the supernatural will not be disappointed.Pros Great depth to RPG elements and remains true to pen-and-paper origins.  Fascinating and diverse list of characters, backed up by fantastic voice acting. Plenty of gameplay freedom and emphasis on player choice. A tonne of interesting missions and side quests, if a bit repetitive.   Excellent atmosphere, with equally remarkable writing and dialogue options throughout. Phenomenal restoration effort (and ongoing support) by the community. Cons Technical issues abound. Requires a fan-made patch to properly play and actually finish. Frequently poor visuals; a mixed bag generally.   Though varied, combat tends to be clunky and dissatisfying at times. Stealth A.I. is poor. Some abilities/attributes are useless or progressively made redundant. Final Thoughts: Technical issues aside, VtMB is the vampire-themed game that you've been dying to play. A great example of the capabilities of the Source engine in it's prime, embrace this flawed gem with lowered expectations or during a sale and prepare for a bloody good time.Rating: 6.5/10			"

												I absolutely adore this game.  A word of warning right up front: As delivered by Steam this game is unplayable, but there is an unofficial patch that is updated and it makes the game entirely playable.  This game makes me want to find a nice group of pen and pencilers to play that version of VtM.  The Hotel level is the scariest thing I've ever played (made more so by the fact that I did it the first time in the middle of the night with no lights on).  The overall story is a little see-through, but there are enough surprises to keep you entertained.Summary: This would be my favorite RPG ever if it wasn't for that pesky KOTOR.  But to be mentioned positively in the same sentence as KOTOR is a huge honor to me.			"

												I was recommended to play this game so many times. Being the idiot that judged a book by its cover, I often threw it aside and left it hanging there in my library. Sure enough, I sift through many old gems in the RPGs section, only to find it again, and again, and again. There must be a reason for an RPG to be great despite the technical difficulties and the outdated graphics, no? Sure enough I go for it (On my fifth attempt of liking it) and I was immediately pulled into its world and characters. This is the best example I would give to anyone asking for a high quality story experience, never mind the fact that it is a great RPG experience. I never played it at its time, but I sure have good memories of Vampire: The masquerade. I am normally not a pushover when it comes to games, but I would easily be one for anyone who is a big fan of RPGs and hasn't experienced such a masterpiece. I don't think I need to go into detail about it aside from the fact that it might turn away a lot of players due to its outdated presentation and technical limitations. Other than that, you can easily guarantee yourself a great game. Wherever you are LaCroix, thank you for showing me this.			"

												Simply put, this is the best game I've ever played, and I've played tons of them over the span of 20+ years of gaming.I'm a huge RPG fan. Easily my favorite genre. I've heard a lot about Bloodlines and people saying how great it was but I didn't get a chance to play it until recently. I'm so glad I finally played it because it is superb.It's got an incredible, believable atmosphere of dread that draws you in completely and hooks you from the first minute of the game. It's got a great story with plenty of intrigue, interesting characters, some dark humor and excellent RPG systems under the hood that all come together to provide a fantastic gaming experience.Your choices actually matter and different things will happen based on how you play the game. Unexpected outcomes can happen if you make the ""wrong"" decision. The game always keeps you on your toes.It's also got it's share of creepiness. You'll explore some levels that will scare you, and it also explores some dark and disturbing themes. As I said at the beginning, it's the best game I've ever played. Highly recommended. 10/10			"

												This game is amazing. It's just so rich - all of the characters and places are incredibly detailed, memorable, and unique. It's also got this filthy, depraved, gritty atmosphere that's always there, even when you're in a fancy hotel or something. Another awesome thing about this game is how many options it gives you, and how what you say and do actually matters. The npcs really recognize the things that you say to them, your clan, your gender, your attitude, etc. For example, if you're playing as a narcisstic, smooth-talking Toreador and you get into a conversation with a vanity-hating Nosferatu, don't expect the conversation to go easily - they'll probably talk about their desire to burn your pretty little face in acid. To boot, the facial expressions and voice acting is amazing, and probably the best I've ever seen in a game.This game is, however, quite glitchy due to its troubled release. For that reason, the unofficial patch is a necessity. Seriously, don't even start playing the game until you've got it installed.All in all, though, this is definitely one of my favorite games of all time. If you're thinking about getting it, do it. You won't regret it!			"

												Spoiler free reviewClassic RPG everyone should try at least once. You take on the role of a newly 'embraced' vampire in the Los Angeles area. There are a few bloodlines from which you can choose that can alter your playstyle and story. Depending on the choices you make there are multiple endings.Combat can be a bit wonky at times but the engaging story more than makes up for it.There is a small but very devoted modding scene for VtMB and I highly recommend getting wesp's unofficial patch if you do get this.

												This dark, gritty, vulgar vampire game is something most people would expect to just be your typical game. This is something that kind of blew my mind. Just played an hour or so into it i noticed that it is very detailed in the types of vampires they have, the abilities, and the lifestyle. They do a very good job keeping everything shadey and making you play the game to discover more of it. You get to create how you want your character and it gives you a few options. Only thing is i noticed is it didn't have a character customization. What happens is theres a character thats pre-determined for each type of vampire. Suprisingly the graphics aren't that bad either. I figured they would be horrible or very dated due to it's time but for the game it still outshines most indie games these days. I will update this further when i play more of the game, but for now i recommend this game. Also if you purchase this game you might run into some issues running. All you need to do is patch the game and heres the link to it. Just simply place the patch into the steam file folder of the game and patch it up and enjoy!Vampires: The Masquerade-Bloodlines 8.4 Patchhttp://gamewatcher.com/mods/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-mod/patch-8-4-2-unofficial "

												This is one of the games that simply enchant you with atmospere and world creation. The story is also great. This is no vampire love storry, and any of available characters would make Edward Cullen run home screaming for mommy. In here you are no prophecised demigod of vampires. You are a newcomer who doesn't know the world he/she's entering and everything around is dirty politics. You want to be a decent vampire? Sure, you'll be in control of the beast. You want to be a bloodsucking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ toying with his prey? You'll also be satisfied. You want to break the rules and kill humans on the street? Go on, but you'll be punished. If you can handle it, you're free to go. But I guarantee the most fun aspect of the game is the role playing, the intrigue, the plot, and finding who (if anyone) is your true firnd at the end. This is a game depicting harsh, brutal, and dark world full of aristocrats, sycophants, celebrities, business moguls and simple junkies. What you do with it is your choice. The only must have in case of this title is an extensive external mod bundle which will fix game's technical issues, enable it to run on newer Windows systems (runs great on my W8) and improve some graphics. But this game is worth this little trouble you'll have starting it up. Thanks to great community I'm going to enjoy it many years since now.			"

												VTMB is a wonderful RPG with amazing writing. Plenty of unexpected plot twists, even the ending surprised me. Lots of humor, which was always enjoyable too. The RPG elements were good, if a little confusing at first, the character sheet can be overwhelming at first glance, but it's easy to get the hang of eventually. VTMB provided you with plenty choices as well, involving not just the plot, but your style of gameplay, some of your dialogue, even extra areas depended on the clan you chose. The length of the game was also very nice, with loads of side quests in each area to do. The only downsides to this game were it's bugs, a lot of which were fixed in the unofficial patches, and the difficulty of some enemies seemed too hard at times, but with careful spending of experience points, lots of quicksaves, and patience, can be defeated easily enough. Overall, definitely one of my favorite games ever.			"

												Bloodlines was damned to be a ""flawed gem"" straight out of the box. Despite a loyal, yet small fanbase creating unnoficial patches to fix the bugs found in the game, it still has a lot to be fixed. The game works on the early Source engine, so it uses to base code for Half Life 2, but the development cycle took different paths from the very beggining. The most notable feature of this RPG in particular is the fact that Experience isn't gained for kiling enemies, but for completing quests or finding alternate or special routes to them. That makes it a lot more that a run & gun game. This is - a true Role Playing Game.Don't overlook it on sale and make sure every person who's interested in properly dignified narrative, story, gothic vibes - that they get a copy. It is worth the magnanimousness, the cause is a product scarcely seen, brought to near extinction.			"

												*** Senneca's nomination: ""Test Of Time Award"" 2016 ***I first played this game in 2004, at a friend's house, and I still enjoy it just as much today.It is easily one of the greatest RPGs of the era, arguably one of the best of all time. I honestly don't think a better vampire themed game has ever been made. However, all that being said, it is not a perfect geme. There are plenty of bugs to contend with, the combat system was bad, even when the game was new, and the graphics definitley show the game's age. Despite the shortcomings, it's well worth the $19.99 Steam is currently charging for it.The game is set in (what was then) contemporary LA. You'll find yourself unwittingly thrust into the vampire subculture that exists ""hiding in plain sight"" among the mortal world. Like the human world, vampire society consits of various factions with their own ideas and values, governed by a set of mutually agreed upon rules. You'll need to learn these rules, and how these factions relate to each other quickly if you want to survive.The setting, and the characters are one of the strengths of the game. Learning to be a vampire, how to feed without being seen, and use your new powers feels natural. Your abilities, and even the dialogue options available to you, will be determined by which clan you choose to be ""embraced into"". Each clan has various strengths and weaknesses, and tend to be aligned with (but not limited to) certain political factions. There are tons of memorable characters you'll meet along the way, and the multiple diologue options, character customization, and high quality voice acting both ensure you'll be back for multiple playthroughs.The gameplay is standard for the RPG genre, with the inevitable bugs that come with them (especially older titles like this game). There are various semi-open world parts of LA that you will be able to explore as you progress through the game. The combat is one of the glaring weaknesses of the game, and the system takes getting used to. Still, you'll eventually figure out the system, and the AI, and as your character gets stronger, you can invest skill points into your chosen combat style (firearms, melee, etc.) to become more effective.All in all this game is a must play for any fan of RPG games, or the vampire genre. I have hundreds of hours sunk into it over the past decade (most of them on my pre-Steam CD copy), and I'm sure you'll get a fair amout out of it too. The only sad part is that we never got a sequel to this amazing game!			"

												A third-person action/RPG that is true to the old whitewolf roleplay system. Pros:- The game is true to the old pen and paper whitewolf system, you'll feel like you're really playing Vampire: The Masquerade- Fun character generation with all the classic vampire clans complete with most of the old powers- Immersive environments that make you feel like you're really in a vampire run city- Intrigue and political tactics true to the setting complete with clan biases and alliances- Interesting items and weapons that seem appropriate for the setting- Different playstyles depending heavily on clan and powers- Interesting quests that add a lot of color to the world- A real feeling of power at higher level, but also danger as the game never becomes easyCons:- Buggy, lots of crashes and locks can make things annoying at times- Lots of prep work needed to get the game running, you usually have to use one of the fan-created patches to get this to work on steam- Some knowledge needed, building a character poorly can make the game very hard to progress inOverall:  This game is a great experience, even with the work needed to get it running (which is usually an instant fail for me), I have to recommend this game.  It's worth the investment to be able to immerse yourself in a game and a world that pays so much respect to the original Whitewolf source material.  And even if you've never played Vampire before, you can enjoy it for the interesting story and unique world.			"

												Use the unofficial patch or this game will be too broken to even touch.Now:Probably the best overall writing ever seen in a video game. Deus Ex, Thief, Morrowind, System Shock and Pathologic were all excellent in their own respects --- but this game beats them all in terms of consistency and believability. Characters actually have personality, conversations actually flow, and every single NPC that can be interacted with has a ton of depth and maybe even a few ulterior motives. This game is easily tied with Deus Ex as the closest we've ever gotten to Warren Spector's ""one city block"" vision. It simply has to be experienced to be believed.Unfortunately, the game is even more broken than Deus Ex. While Deus Ex was marred by half-baked and unsatisfying systems that would make for a terrible games on their own, this game is marred by a ton of systems that are either there for no reason whatsoever or just outright don't work. The Seduction skill makes Deus Ex's Swimming look useful, and there is absolutely no reason to use firearms at any point in the game. Not even the tutorial for firearms requires that you use them --- they are that useless. For the first two areas, the game is a brilliant collage of choices and possibilities, surpassing even, yes, Deus Ex, but that vision becomes more and more distant as the game goes on, to the point where the latter half of the game is a concoction of horribly rushed and bland dungeon crawls and some of the worst boss fights even seen in games and the final area is almost entirely devoid of any complex architecture, sidequests or secrets. The story comes to a similarly rushed, mean-spirited and silly conclusion. If there was ever a game that deserved this kind of fate, this one wasn't it.Overall, this game is Deus Ex taken to the extreme in every aspect --- while the world of Deus Ex occasionally felt real and personal, Bloodlines' world bursts at the seems with life, and for a precious moment, one could be forgiven for seeing the World of Darkness as truly alive and endless. While Deus Ex was somewhat weak in its mechanics and failed to retain its momentum into the latter stages of the game, Bloodlines barely functions at all beyond its first few stages and completely falls apart in the latter half. This game is utterly brilliant for its first half, but the second half will make any player mourn for what it could have been. Considering the fact that Troika closed its doors after Bloodlines' release and nobody has so much as attempted something approaching the first half of the game ever since, it's unlikely that we'll see a happy ending for this kind of game, so we have no choice but to enjoy this precious specimen.

												Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is an underrated gem and probably the best vampire game ever made. If you're a fan of deep RPG's and have never played this game you're missing out. The world, the unforgettable characters and the incredible in-depth lore taken from the original tabletop game is amazing and deserves to be praised.Although the game looks dated from a graphical standpoint and it's far from bug free, thanks to the fan created Unofficial Patch the game is playable on most modern systems, fixes most of the instability issues and quest bugs and even restores some lost and/or unfinished content. The combat is still clunky though and the stealth AI remains poor but this is luckily easy overshadowed by the fantastic story and atmosphere in this game.Apart from that, the well written dialogue, the great voice acting, the stylish music, the variety in quests that you can undertake and the complete freedom to approach each situation in a number of different ways all make this game standout to this day. You are free to explore and there are countless side quests to stumble upon, each with their own unique story, there is certainly no copy and paste content here.Technical issues aside this is still one hell of a game. If you haven't already, pick this game up and give it a try, it deserves to be played.			"

												First things first.  To deal with the game's issue with not being able to load properly, disable Steam updates and load the latest non-official patch.  After that, you're golden.  As far as good RPGs are concerned, I find myself returning to this game a lot.  I don't think I've ever had an RPG draw me into its world and characters as much as this one has, and the more I play it, the more I enjoy it.  It has its rough edges, mostly moments where combat is inevitable and odds feel stacked a bit unfairly against you.  Still, I love the ever living heck out of the interactions you have with characters, the dialogue, and the choices you can make thoughout the game.  Don't like the cop stopping you?  Mind control him, persuade him, seduce him.  There are plenty of choices and it's beautiful.  The game plays just long enough not to overstay its welcome.  Take the plunge and enter the World of Darkness.			"

												There is a reason this game still comes in on my Top 10 Favorite Games. At time of writing I have logged over 60 hours into this game. I love the setting, the gameplay, and the experiance that it presents to you.        The creatures and clans remain faithful to their source material which makes for a great mix of horror and RPG. Some of the creepier places really get under your skin. When this game came out, it had top of the line graphics, but has aged a bit. That doesn’t distract from the incredible art direction and level design.         With each clan bringing a unique playstyle, and 5 endings, this game has a lot of replayability. I especially enjoyed the madness inducing Malkavians. The game will often give you a goal and have several ways to accomplishing it. 10 years after the fact, I still love and play this game. Make sure you get the unofficial patch though. It fixes a lot of bugs and adds a lot of extra content (mainly stuff the designers hadn’t finished yet).Overall, if your looking for a great game with horror/RPG elements, give this game a try. It will suck you into its world!Highly Recommended5/5			"

												There is very little I can say about this game that has not been said. I love it. The progression system, level of autonomy of the character and how they interact with the nerative, the writing, and the voice acting are all amazing and they are what make this game. The combat system is kind of crap and it's a bit of a buggy mess (PLAY WITH THE UNOFICIAL COMMUNITY PATCH!! Really, don't even bother trying to play it venilla. Buy the game and then download the patch THEN play it) but once you patch it up what few drawbacks there are to this game are completely forgoten once you get sunk into the deap and rich world that was writen for us in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. Ultimately there is a very good reason this game is a cult classic and why the community still loyally patches and updates the mods for this game fairly regularly. Two thumbs up. 12/10. Play this game.			"

												Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, is Role Playing game released in 2004. You can play in both First or Third-person Mode, as one of several vampire clans each with their own abilities and gameplay style: Playing as Nosferatu, are especially challenging. You start the game as a fledgling vampire who has to find your way through the streets of Los Angeles. Along the way you learn about the Various Vampire clans, as well as investigate a recently discovered relic that is supposed to bring an end to all vampires. The story takes you through Santa Monica, Downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood, Chinatown, as well as the Underground. I don't want to go into the story to much, due to spoilers, but I will say the game has varying levels of difficult depending on what clan you choose to play as. You have the ability to create ghouls, which are humans who are fed Vampire blood, giving them powers, and binding the ghoul to you. I personally like the voice acting in this game and found some of the characters to be memorable such as; Jeanette. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is a fun RPG, worth your time if you are into Occult-themed games. "

												What to say about this game, man. First don't let the 1.1 hours mislead you, I've put around ten hours so far into this game. The Unofficial patch functions outside of steam so the counters not gonna work. I reccomend the patch by the way it has a list of improvements that make the game more enjoyable.The Pro's:-Lore. There's a lot of it and it is fairly easy to understand most of it.-Graphics. Top notch for it's time, early 2000's, it has aged pretty well to my eyes.-Audio/Voice Acting. The background music is pretty atmospheric and in tense situtions got my heart quickening a bit. The VO is well acted and cast, Each important and even supporting characters feel very distinct.-Gameplay. It's an rpg so you'll have to manage stats and what not but I found keeping track of your ""Humanity"" interesting as well as ""The Masquerade"". Falling to zero in either of those is game over. Also don't die, that's a game over too...-You Are a Vampire Baby! Bloody act like it!!!!!The Cons:-Some small bugs are still present even with the patch but that's to be expected. Nothing is perfect.-Character creation is really limited. You have about a dozen sub species of vampire to choose from but you CAN'T go in and edit facial appearances or anything. Options are limited to race, gender, backstory and predetermined body build. Each has it's own strengths and weakness. My character is a Brujah, strong willed idealist types but low self control when ""The Thirst"" rears its ugly head. (I use The phrase ""The Thirst"" because the Blade movies had the better term.)-Quest details often give you very little clues as to where to find goals. You'll end up wandering about before figuring out that you need to be in a area that hasn't been unlocked to you yet.-Managing your skills seems a bit daunting at the very begining but it gets smoother as you go on.-Quick travel between areas but not to specific locations i.e. clubs, motels and such. So be prepared to walk, a lot...This game is savage (in a good way) and is well worth playing atleast twice I feel. I give it 9 out of 10 bites to the neck. Would bite again and again. Hehehe the Thirst always wins...			"

												This is a no-brainer purchase/must-play for anyone who is familiar with White Wolf's World of Darkness franchise, anyone who has played the first of the legacy Vampire the Masquerade games, anyone who plays LARP or tabletop versions of VtM, or really anyone who is even vaguely interested in an introduction to the rich lore offered by an immersive and addictive tabletop game series. Unlike with Vampire the Masquerade: Redemption, where you are forced to play out the storyline set before you from the perspective of a ""true"" Brujah, this game gives you the choice of what clan you are to be embraced under, and it gives you a taste of the what the game world is really about, allowing your choices to affect the events that play out around you. Ofcourse, there are still linear aspects of the game, and a few glitches here and there, but thankfully there is an entire decade of reliable user-made updates that improve upon those, along with increases in graphics and presentation. All around, this is an excellent game that I would recommend to so many of my friends that are interested in dark fantasy role playing games.			"

												This is probably my favorite game ever created. I like this as much as Rappers like tax evasion(seriously guys do you taxes). I would even go as far as saying greatness and this game go together like Nicole Richie and calorie counters. The game allows you to make a character from 5 different clans. These clans all have thier own special abilities and feel really different. Oh yeah, I should mention that the game is very stat heavy. Now I am going to put down what I liked about the game in cliffnotes because current society's attention span is as short as Gary Coleman doing the crabwalk. Let us get into this,What I liked?-Very stat heavy which makes for some interesting skillchecks-Multiple ways to create a character-Multiple ways to complete a mission-Brilliant Dialogue(If you want movie type of dialogue this is the game if you want book type of dialogue look for Planetscape : Torment)-Voice acting is spot on, probably one of the best voice acting ever recorded in an rpg.-Combat abilities are just marvelous-Clan specific abilities give your character a different feel.-Lots of Side Missions-Interesting story component-Multiple Endings-Mixture of Minor and Major Decisions to be made(Not all rpgs should be based on making decisions of finding a cure for cancer or ending world hunger)What I didn't like?-BUGS. With the amount of bugs that this game has, you would think it was made by an obsidian programmer working through a hangover. The amount of bugs in this game are probably being cast for ANTZ 2(3?). When I think about the bugs i run away in peril because I think they are all over me. (They are amazing patches to fix this though)-The last quarter of the game was more copy paste than that friend of yours that leaves assignments till sunday. Seriously troika fix your ♥♥♥♥.Other than that it is probably my most favorite game out there. I would go ahead and give it what it is due. VTMB with patches and everything is a complete 9.7/10. I absolutely wasted and had so much fun in this game. I would recommend it for anyone that wants to have fun.

												i played this game before it was on steam. beat it once and did several playthroughs that i didnt finish. (or did i ?)so nevermind my 5.3 hours on record.this rpg is very similiar to the deus ex games. a lot of your time will be spend in open ""hub""? areas where there is a lot to explore and find.a lot of places you didnt expect to be there and some disturbing secrets.combat wise you can shoot, sneak, bash and use bloodmagic and the like. all is mostly stat based.there are no levels in the game you just get exp that you can spend on anything you like whenever you like. (except for some clan exclusive abilities)this game is highly NONlinear. there are not only multiple endings but branching storylines and various ways to complete a quest.want to talk your way through the entire game? well you can. but make sure your vampire clan isnt nosferatu or you will be so hideously deformed that most people will run away from you and call the cops. sometimes you might convince someone you had a horrible accident but you should really stick to the shadows and mostly the sewers where you feed on rats.want to be part of the insane malkavian clan so you cant speak one coherent sentence and creep everybody out and convince human beings that they are in fact turtles? you can too but prepare for things to unfold very differently. or do you want to be part of the snobbish ruler clan where the lower classes will treat you with disdain or a pretty boy (or gal) who charmes and seduces his way through the game (to the disdain of certain nosferatus).you can choose to hack computers and talk and find clues to complete quest. or bully, brawl and shoot your way through the questlines. you can be compassionate, insane or cruel all these things shape the story you will experience. not only can you decide the way you approach the game mechanically but you also have a say in how the story unfolds. for better or worse.there is a lot of atmosphere and humour to the game so there are definitely light hearted moments. but for the most part its all about lowlife, decadence, depravity, perversion and supernatural and sometimes even lovecraftian horror.bloodlines is using the source engine (the half life 2 one). im not sure but i think it came out before half life 2 and it certainly shows. but the facial animations in the dialouge are on point. ranging from bored teenage store clerk, doped up pawn shop owner or insane cultist. oh and the mutliple choice dialogue is decently expansive. with great writing.troika went broke while completing the game so it was released in a very buggy state. nonetheless this game was (and still is) considered by many rpg fans as one of the best. i concur. if you like deus ex or just rpgs in general you will find a lot to like. its quite unique and unmatched in many ways. certainly the best vampire game on the market.even 13 years (wow really? time flies!) after release the community is still active in modding and patching the game. you should definitely (yes there is no argument to be had) get the latest unofficial community patch by wesp (i think) from patchesscrolls. the last one is from a few days ago. shows you the dedication of certain fans. a lot of bugfixes and an optional plus patch that restores content cut from the game due to development limitations and such.the voice acting ranges from superp and excellent to ""sufficient"". but the enviromental sounds are quite fitting and the soundtrack gives you a great neonoir (thats a thing right?) feeling.theres a lot more to mention and im sure other steam reviews will help you out or some big game reviewers go into more detail. all in all its a fantastic game and there is no reason not to try it.(btw if you live in germany dont be put off by the ""low violence"" disclaimer)this ""low violence"" version used to be sold as the german uncut version in stores and it basically is.the only confirmed cut is a nanosecond of the intro sequence and if you install the unoffical patch ""plus"" the restoration stuff you dont have to ""worry"" about that either.pro +great writing. (story and dialogue)interesting characters.decent facial animations.classless system.great atmosphere. (with some ♥♥♥♥ your pants moments.)highly non linear.lots of replayability. decent hacking mechanic and a cool computer interface where you actually have to type.lots of weapons, magic. stats and talents. (you can make people go insane or puke blood and stuff goood times)different vampire clans that are really different! people will react to you differently. greatly.cool soundtrack and enviromental sounds.voice acting is really good when its good.community patches and mods.gory fun.lovecraftian reverences..twistscon -dated graphics.will be buggy without patches.can be frustrating due to its sometimes harsh difficulty.you can potentially screw up your character build.voice acting is not so good sometimes. (unless its great)overall a great game. just dont expect a first person shooter. it isnt one. its more like the fallout or deus ex games in that respect.i say buy the game and spread the word about how awesome it is.lets hope troika or some developers of it make a comeback.and uh.... ""dont open it"".			"

												Note: I have previously played a non-steam version therefore playtime hours are not accurate.Judging by its own merit, I cannot recommend this game since its most important aspect, the gameplay, is badly made. There are bugs (unnoficial patches alleviate but do not solve everything), the combat is horrendous and stealth in higher levels is so overpowered it breaks the game. If you have no interest in Vampire the Masquerade, it is better to skip this title unless you are an RPG afficionado and can stomach the problems I cited.But going beyond this, analyzing the rich setting of an anarch controlled Los Angeles where Troika Games completely NAILED to a point of almost perfection, the amount of interesting quests and ways to complete it the game redeems itself.

The patches have made the graphics acceptable, without being great. The controls are where the game shows its age the most as they can sometimes be annoying and clunky but its the only important flaw in what i would qualify otherwise as a masterpiece.

												This game is so good that you even forget that this is an old game (with its related limitations). It perfectly represents the punk gothic scenario designed for the Storyteller’s RPG, putting all the environmental, climate, and situations exactly as it should be in such world - a must for those who used to play the RPG. The history is very interesting and the dialogues are well written and very funny several times. Even the advertisement that plays on the radio (which you can ignore if you want) is funny and well elaborated. The haunted house mission is a memorable moment of the game and is a good example of how this game is well made. In overall, any fan of the genre will have a lot of fun playing it and I definitely recommend it.As a con, the necessity of having to use an external patch from a third party in order to get the best performance of the game is something bad as you expect to purchase a perfect version. However, the forum is really helpful to guide the player through this process and it worked fine for me. Sometimes the game got buggy, but nothing that harassed the gameplay.			"

												This game is buggy as all hell with horrible combat and glitches to put you in a state of rage, but I still enjoy it. I hate some of the aged mechanics as much as I love them. Vampire Bloodlines has all these faults but also nostalgic charm. It's set in a goth/punk world with great music, atmosphere and just a berserk personality all on its own. There are many quests and 5 endings to explore but I recommened checking out GameBanshee to guide you along the way for the sewers are difficult to navigate. Also helps you save on EPs and hooks you up with more info about the clans. This game sucks sometimes but I believe its worth the adventure.			"

(except for some clan exclusive abilities)this game is highly NONlinear. there are not only multiple endings but branching storylines and various ways to complete a quest.want to talk your way through the entire game? well you can. but make sure your vampire clan isnt nosferatu or you will be so hideously deformed that most people will run away from you and call the cops. sometimes you might convince someone you had a horrible accident but you should really stick to the shadows and mostly the sewers where you feed on rats.want to be part of the insane malkavian clan so you cant speak one coherent sentence and creep everybody out and convince human beings that they are in fact turtles? you can too but prepare for things to unfold very differently. or do you want to be part of the snobbish ruler clan where the lower classes will treat you with disdain or a pretty boy (or gal) who charmes and seduces his way through the game (to the disdain of certain nosferatus).you can choose to hack computers and talk and find clues to complete quest. or bully, brawl and shoot your way through the questlines. you can be compassionate, insane or cruel all these things shape the story you will experience. not only can you decide the way you approach the game mechanically but you also have a say in how the story unfolds. for better or worse.there is a lot of atmosphere and humour to the game so there are definitely light hearted moments. but for the most part its all about lowlife, decadence, depravity, perversion and supernatural and sometimes even lovecraftian horror.bloodlines is using the source engine (the half life 2 one). im not sure but i think it came out before half life 2 and it certainly shows. but the facial animations in the dialouge are on point. ranging from bored teenage store clerk, doped up pawn shop owner or insane cultist. oh and the mutliple choice dialogue is decently expansive. with great writing.troika went broke while completing the game so it was released in a very buggy state. nonetheless this game was (and still is) considered by many rpg fans as one of the best. i concur. if you like deus ex or just rpgs in general you will find a lot to like. its quite unique and unmatched in many ways. certainly the best vampire game on the market.even 13 years (wow really? time flies!) after release the community is still active in modding and patching the game. you should definitely (yes there is no argument to be had) get the latest unofficial community patch by wesp (i think) from patchesscrolls. the last one is from a few days ago. shows you the dedication of certain fans. a lot of bugfixes and an optional plus patch that restores content cut from the game due to development limitations and such.the voice acting ranges from superp and excellent to ""sufficient"". but the enviromental sounds are quite fitting and the soundtrack gives you a great neonoir (thats a thing right?) feeling.theres a lot more to mention and im sure other steam reviews will help you out or some big game reviewers go into more detail. all in all its a fantastic game and there is no reason not to try it.(btw if you live in germany dont be put off by the ""low violence"" disclaimer)this ""low violence"" version used to be sold as the german uncut version in stores and it basically is.the only confirmed cut is a nanosecond of the intro sequence and if you install the unoffical patch ""plus"" the restoration stuff you dont have to ""worry"" about that either.pro +great writing. (story and dialogue)interesting characters.decent facial animations.classless system.great atmosphere. (with some ♥♥♥♥ your pants moments.)highly non linear.lots of replayability. decent hacking mechanic and a cool computer interface where you actually have to type.lots of weapons, magic. stats and talents. (you can make people go insane or puke blood and stuff goood times)different vampire clans that are really different! people will react to you differently. greatly.cool soundtrack and enviromental sounds.voice acting is really good when its good.community patches and mods.gory fun.lovecraftian reverences..twistscon -dated graphics.will be buggy without patches.can be frustrating due to its sometimes harsh difficulty.you can potentially screw up your character build.voice acting is not so good sometimes. (unless its great)overall a great game. just dont expect a first person shooter. it isnt one. its more like the fallout or deus ex games in that respect.i say buy the game and spread the word about how awesome it is.lets hope troika or some developers of it make a comeback.and uh.... ""dont open it"".			"

												NOTE: It says I have zero game hours because I used the unofficial patch and it didn't record my Steam hours. Just know that I played this game ALOT.This is my second favorite role-playing game of all time! And it's still extremely close to my first favorite, Mass Effect 2. The voice acting is really, really good. You get a pen and paper-like character customizer where you get to pick your gender, and vampire clan along with a backstory about before you became a vampire. The intro is really interesting and builds the world very well. You really do feel like a vampire that's hiding their true identity in Los Angeles. Each quest is interesting, and are all worth playing. Instead of an open world, you get four hub cities Santa Monica, Hollywood, Downtown, and Chinatown. Depending on your gender, clan, and certain skills, you can select alot of interesting dialogue options, and unlock more too! The lore is very interesting, and I recommend studying it on the White Wolf Wiki if you're gonna buy this game. This game also has great characters who are all very detailed in the world. In fact, my favorite gaming character of all time came from this game, Therese Voerman. If you look past the dated graphics, even some bugs with the unofficial patch still installed, and look at all the great things this game has to offer like detailed role-playing, interesting characters, a well set up world, rich lore, and great quests, you can easily have alot of fun with this game.

												Talked about a visit from the past...I was one of the 80,000 soul that actually brought this game when it was first released. Altough i enjoyed almost all aspect of the game the massive amount of bugs just kept me out and i quickly lost insterest and i didn't even finish it.Now.. many many years later i saw this game again on Steam with a overwhelming positive review... that just got me curious and picked it up for just a couple dollar. The unofficial patch fixxed nearlly all the problems I had before with improved graphics, characters and dialogs.. it did took me a bit time to get it work on windows 8.1 but i it's definitly worth it.. gonna do a playthough for at least 5 games  with Brujah Anach, Torey Cami, Nos Cami, Malk Anach and Ventrue Sabbat for sure.I would recommend this game to anyone that has ever played any RPG. It's a diamond in the rough that survied the test of time.			"

												It took me years to finally try Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines after hearing so much praise for it, and i have got to say it was worth it. VtMB is a really great RPG, it may be dated, buggy and even ""unfinished"" but with the help of a patch or two nothing is stopping you from enjoying the game. I can say now I am most definitely interested in playing a new Vampire: The Masquerade game at some point in the future. I would recommend Bloodlines to pretty much any RPG or classic game fan. I feel the series would be much more popular had more people played Bloodlines, and recommend you do so if you even find it remotely interesting.			"

												Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines is a rare gem. It takes the basic gameplay of the intelligent shooters of old and mixes it with a heavy does of RPG mechanics and open ended storytelling.Bloodlines start you off in a very classic vampire way, you find yourself in a seedy motel room being hot and heavy with someone of the opposite sex when all of the sudden they bite you. Before you get a chance to get your bearings some goons storm the place and take you and your new lover away to a court where your lover is executed for making a new vampire without permission but you are uncharacteristically spared. You are then set loose on the streets where a friendly old geezer explains what it means to be a vampire and after a quick tutorial introducing you the various concepts of the game you are free to explore the city.Bloodlines is a first person shooter in it's most basic form although many of the weapons and abilities are melee in nature. It takes a great deal of inspiration from Deus Ex and System Shock by creating a myriad of different ways to go about each area. Lots of vents and back alleys, locks to pick and people to persuade. There is always another way to go about things depending on your skills and inclination. The RPG system is fairly straight forward, you get skill points as you level up which can then be put into a myriad of different skills and abilities including some special vampire magic that tends to be specific to the vampire clan you select during character creation.The vampire clans are on the big highlights of the game with the most notable mentions being Nosferatu who are hideous and unable to pass for a human unlike the other clans and the the Malkavians who are, quite literally, completely and utterly insane. Both of these change the way you play and experience the game significantly and in particular the Malkavian guarantees you will need a second playthrough.The main storyline isn't anything tremendously exciting however the smaller side-quests and the world itself is exceptionally well written and acted and you will feel heavily immersed throughout the game.Source is the engine upon which this is all created which makes for a decent looking game even though it was released a good while after Half-Life 2 due to licensing issues which unfortunately also had the side-effect of absolutely killing the sales of this game and also Troika, the developers.When originally released Bloodlines was extremely bug ridden despite the delay in release and it was nearly unplayable at that point, now however most of the bugs have been patched out and for those few things left unfinished there is a very high quality fan made patch that I recommend everyone gets before playing the game.All in all Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines is one of the best games of the modern era and one of the few modern games that manages to pull off a first person view without losing sight of what the game is trying to accomplish. You could classify it as an action RPG or as a first person shooter with some RPG elements but either way, it's a great game.			"

												VTMB......A Truely epic FPS/RPG. The game uses the source engine so even today the graphics are still quite nice, there are also graphics mods available to improve your game. If you like vampires ( no not the damn sparkly ones) this is a definite buy. The story is quite gripping and pulls you into the shadow world of the vampire. There are many different vampires to choose from the misshapen nosferatu, to your more seductive Ventrue. The skill tree for each vampire type is different so your can truely have a unique vampire in its own right.Final score: 85/100			"

												Rating: 8.5/10What is it? First Person RPG in a vampire setting. The Good:+ Character creation is excellent. You start off by choosing your vampire clan. Each clan has its own set of abilities. Two clans in particular really change the game up: The Malkavians and the nosferatu really play differently from the other clans offering some nice replay value.+ Lots of stats to further build your character. Play as a melee, stealth, guns, hacking etc.  Build a character that fits your play style+ The plot and characters are interesting, they really flesh out the story and dialogue. + Great main and side missions+ Multiple ways of completing your missions depending on your character build. Go in guns blazing, or sneak in through the back, etc. + A lengthy game that never feels boring or drawn out simply because the developers did a good job of keeping things interesting all the way through. The Bad:- Technical and texture glitches. The game was officially patched however there were still plenty of bugs left over. You must play with some of the unofficial patches. I was playing with a widescreen mod which may have contributed to all the texture anomalies. -The combat feels less polished then the rest of the game. Melee combat goes into third person view which could be off putting to some. Using guns can be very frustrating and probably won't be worth it until you invest some heavy experience points into the firearm skill. Guns probably won't be effective until half way through the game. - Some really annoying parts of the game.  Luckily it was far and few between to really hurt the overall experience.ConclusionA great game, and if you love RPG's this is a great game that you can't go wrong with. Possibly one of the best vampire games out there.  "

												It should be noted straight away that this game cannot be run on modern operating systems without unofficial patches. For those who don't want to take the time to figure out how to do this, you'll probably want to avoid purchasing this game.That said, if you're comfortable with spending a few minutes finding and installing the unofficial patches, you might find this game interesting. You should probably wait for a deep-cut sale though; $20 for a 10 year old game that barely made it out of production is a little silly.The good:- Excellent writing (easily the best aspect of the game)- Compelling storyline- Interesting lore and characters- Voice acting is very well done- Play as one of seven vampire clans with differing abilities- Allows for several different play styles- Explore side quests in a non-linear fashion- Multiple endingsThe bad:- Combat feels very clumsy. The defensive stance in melee combat is essentially worthless. It is difficult to maneuver and avoid being hit by enemy attacks.- The game favors melee combat until much later in the game where guns are very powerful. However, since this is an RPG, the player must level up their skills one way or the other. Certain boss encounters are very difficult for players who choose a melee play style.- There are stats that are basically worthless to invest in, such as haggling. Lockpicking and hacking can be useful for those in a hurry, but are in most cases not needed since keys and password notes can be found nearby. Other stats such as those used to influence others in dialogue are useful early on in the game, but aren't used at all later on.- It is not possible to remain in first-person view at all times. The game forces you into the third-person view when engaging in melee combat. Ranged combat functions like a first person shooter.- The player can make many different choices, but there are no diverging story paths. All choices the player makes eventually lead to the same outcome.- The graphics aren't terrible, but look quite dated.- At times there are graphical glitches or weird physics.			"

												I'm not normally a fan of Vampire games, but I picked up this one upon recommendation by a friend, and holy cow is it good! Important points include:1) There are violent encounters you can turn into diplomatic ones, if you're very diplomatic.2) There are stealth encounters you can turn into shoot 'em up encounters, if you're inclined.3) The game is reasonably faithful to the tabletop, but makes some pretty clear changes to make it a good video game.4) There's a mission where you're supposed to get rid of a ghost. It just might be the scariest mission in the whole game, and you don't fight a single monster or enemy the whole time.5) If you play the game as a Malkavian, your flaw is that you're crazy. So they changed all the dialogue options to reflect this, voiced over responses to your crazy talk, and made a few other changes to make it really work.6) This is the first time since high school that I felt like I really wanted to play a vampire tabletop game.NOTE: The unofficial patch (now in version 9.0) is basically required to play this game on a modern computer.

												I actually really enjoyed and still enjoy this game. True, everything about this game is dated, the graphics though good then seem poor now and the interactions between you and in game NPCS range from linear to non-existent. That being said, I love this game, it is dark, gritty, and really gives you that predatory sense you would expect from being on top of the food chain. The dialogue that you do experience between your character and other characters never feels forced and is almost always engaging. Additionally I want to say,  being Malkavian is so entertaining that even though the general story does not change regardless of what clan you pick, it feels like a completely different experience.  This game gives out multiple endings, with interesting plot twists and a whole ranges of level concepts ranging from frightening to pure combat. My only real complaint about this game are in the in game cut scenes, I don't know exactly what it is, but the models at times look so hunched over and walk like they have too poop sometimes that I get actively annoyed. All that being said, definitely worth exploring the world of darkness if you got the time.  "

												One of the greatest FPSRPG games of all time, thwarted by it's own ambitious design, a publisher that refused to allocate funds to finish and polish the game, and valve cockblocking the release until half life 2 was out (which of course stole all the limelight and caused the game to sell poorly)It has since developed a cult following, and numerous unnofficial patches and gameplay updates.It really succeeds in making you feel like an undead badass and in portraying a world that thrives at 3am, features memorable locations like a gothic nightclub, a hollywood porno store and of course a haunted house (and theatre, and cemetary, and derelict hospital, and rundown apartment building, and fish market.... basically there's a lot of hauntings)Features some terrific writing, dialogue and humour. It also has a great levelling system where allocated skills and abilities actually affect the gameplay in a big way.Gamebreaking bugs and glitches can usually be overcome with the unnofficial patches, and are highly recommended.

												Bloodlines is a flawed gem of a game, it had a troubled as hell development and it really shows. The game is a buggy mess, but thankfully fans have patched out a lot of the bugs so make sure to get the Wesp fan patch before you play. To sum it up Bloodlines has some of the best atmosphere, writing, and actual roleplaying in an RPG and it still really holds up to this day. There's multiple solutions through missions and each vampire clan have their own unique skills to solve them, i.e. Nosferatu can turn themselves invisible, Tremere have powerful blood magic, and Malkavians can drive people insane. Sadly, the game falls apart in the end with some horrid forced combat sections (So make sure you have a good combat build going, though just cheating through it is totally fine) but it ultimately is a game worth playing because there are still way too few RPGs that are like it.

												Well, where to start with this game. It is easy to be swallowed in to the game by it's rich storyline and a fantasticly written dialogue - but it's not just that. I felt immersed in this game that was able to describe and not only give me an idea of - but also allow me to feel like I was suddenly pulled into a vampire society. Which, judging by the popularity of the vampire genre in video gaming, seems to be something that many games involving vampires have great difficulty with. I look forward to the future and hope that the vampire genre can be inspired by this game.I'll list the pros and cons of this briefly, from my experience. Pros:~ Deep and non-linear storyline.~ At the start, you can choose your stats or 'roll' them randomly (let the game decide!), and have a choice of clans with their own personality, background, advantages and disadvantages.~ Creative and well written dialogue, of which can change depending on chosen clan.~ Voice acting that fits well with the characters and enriches their personalities.~ Many hours of play filled with many missions and many choices for you to make.~ Experience various entertaining kinds of insanity.Cons:~ There are bugs. The patch does help with this and is easy to find with a web search. However, it does not eliminate them completely, and this is also to be expected when playing an old game. Personally I wasn't bothered by them, as I was too busy enjoying the storyline.~ Combat is funky. This links with the bugs, but don't get me wrong - there are tough fights.~ Graphics can be improved with the patch I believe, but are still old. It's not disasterous or unplayable however, by any means - on the contrary, very good for an old game in my opinion.~ For some people this will be a con. SAVE OFTEN. Your experience of the game will differ in places depending on the choices you make, and you may want to go back to have a different experience later. And then of course, there's always the possibility of getting shredded up and dying.			"

												This is a great game! If you can get it to work. That's right. Before buying VTMB, you should know what you're getting yourself into. The game was never finished; it was released as an imcomplete, buggy, broken product - and that's what it still is, even today. Teams of modders have been working on it to either fix as many bugs as they could or even to rebalance and redesign it and to install one of the unofficial patches is, after installing the game to your hard drive, the very first thing you should do; but even so, be prepared for a world of bugs, crashes, google searches, .exe replacing, .cfg tweaking and so on.Let me tell you about my experience with this game. I bought it. Then, I installed Tessara's gold patch which, supposedly (and I have no reason to think otherwise) does an amazing job at fixing all the imaginable problems this game was released with. Then I had to find a way to make the screen resolution acceptable (not 1024*768, this isn't 1999 anymore). Then I was on the street and I noticed a loss of framerate, so I tweaked the .cfg file to deactivate meteo effects. After a couple hours I reached a beach and the game started crashing, forcing my computer into sleep mode. I couldn't get past that beach. Later on I found that the sea's texture was making my comps go bananas so I went for more .cfg tweaking. Then I played a couple more hours and the AI, suddenly, disabled itself - meaning, NPCs froze in place, making the game completely unplayable. Then, as I was looking for a solution, my comps started crashing again.That was it. I decided to wait a year or two for the (unbelievably dedicated) teams of modders who were working at fixing this game, and uninstalled Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines.Now don't get me wrong - some people (with Tessara's help in any case) are able to play VTMB just fine. I was able to play for like 5 hours and it was great - dark, immersive, great attention to detail, thrilling game system, great infiltration sequences... It feels like Deus Ex all over again. It feels like a pen & paper experience where I'm alone with the game master. It feels great.But it's ♥♥♥♥ing unstable. It's broken. Anyone considering purchasing this game should know that there's a risk that it won't work at all, that you'll spend as much time fixing it as playing it. Buying this game is a gamble - you're risking your money here.But, again, when it works, whoa, guys - what a ride!			"

												This is by the far the best single vampire game in existence.There have been countless vampire games through the years.  Some focus on the monster, some focus on the romance,  Most you don't particularly have to think about all the consequences of becoming one.  This game will immerse you in a seductive and dangerous world of vampirism the likes of which has not been replicated to this degree in a game.  And when I say you, I mean you.  It is a deeply personal affair in which you can take a personal journey or a journey of any character you wish, with whatever depth you wish.Do you want to be the outcasts of society?  Do you want to be the Hollywood monster that people avert their gaze from?  Do you want to be the Anne Rice version of a vampire?  Smart, seductive, ruthless.  Do you want to be utterly insane?  So many ways to make yourself your own, so many ways to interact with the myriad of story lines in the dark, urban nightlife of Cali.The music is also phenomenal.  Utterly fantastic.  The soundtrack feels dark and gritty while you're wandering the streets, diving in sewers and popping in night clubs seducing and making your way.Modding is REQUIRED.  I say again, R E Q U I R E D.  Don't think about playing this without extensive research on the must have mods.  The story of this title is infamous, go read if you want to know why it requires so much rework and how passionate this community around it is.  I did the unofficial patch and a few graphic overall mods myself, your mileage may vary.Writing this review makes me want to install it again and play...If you have any interest of vampires whatsoever, pick it up!

												This game, moreso than any others I've played, embodies the word ""classic"". Though buggy and unpolished in its original state of release, the unofficial patch allows this title to reach its full potential: an experience that completely draws you into its gloomy, thoroughly immersive settings, with characters so vibrant as to make you almost think - and certainly wish - that you were carrying on conversations with the most intriguing individuals you could ever imagine. The class customization and dialogue options allow you to feel like you're shaping your own destiny, and progression is steady and fairly well paced, so that by the end, you feel like you're ready to step into whatever epic showdown awaits. With atmospheric music, witty personalities, unique game mechanics, and absolutely top-notch voice-acting, this is a  vampire adventure you'd be sorry you missed out on.			"

												As a huge fan of the VTM tabletop game, I'll admit, I was skeptical when I first bought this.  Sometimes adapting one media into another (be it book to movie, game to movie or, in this case, one type of game to another), it either loses something or gains WAY too much to be enjoyable to longtime fans of whatever the previous media was.  So, yeah, I had my doubts -- but let me tell you, they were entirely unfounded.  This has become one of my favorite (if not absolute favorite) RPGs of all time.  Not only does it stay true to the source, which was a big selling point for me, but it is so incredibly easy to become immersed in the world you're presented.  The atmosphere is wonderful, especially for an older game when creating those elements is a bit more limited than it is now; maybe it's just me, but while wandering around Santa Monica, L.A., and the rest, I definitely do get that feeling of 'city by night'.  Lots of memorable NPCs scattered about, and the combat system is..fair, I think.  A little wonky here and there, but for the most part, it's pretty smooth.  That your decisions/dialogue affect some aspects of gameplay is always a neat element, too,  and as an added bonus:  no sparkly, wussy vampires.  That goes along with 'staying true to the source', yes, but for anyone who can't help but roll their eyes upon seeing 'vampire', it's worth calling attention to this.Really, I can only find two major downfalls for this game:  first and foremost would be the graphics.  While again, it is a beautiful game, especially for its age, it certainly could benefit from some better visuals, especially where player characters and NPCs are concerned.  This isn't super important to me or anything, as it doesn't take...well, anything, away from the game, but it is worth mentioning.  Second would be the fact that there is no fast travel while in a zone.  It DOES help with immersion, I'll admit, and it's not like the zones are HUGE, by any means, but sometimes it does seem tedious to have to run from point A to point B.All in all, thought, this game is absolutely fantastic.  It's hardly perfect, but for anyone who enjoys RPGs, I cannot possibly recommend this one enough.  This is just one of those games where, every time someone mentions it, someone else will just HAVE to reinstall it.  It's just THAT good.			"

Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines is filled with a dark, seedy, gory and erotic atmosphere that makes the gameplay all the more intense. VTMB is a story-rich, choice-driven experience where your thought process, your beliefs, your moral compass and the way you interpret situations directly affect both gameplay and story. VTMB awards the player with malleable main quests, a variety of secondary quests and comprehensive characters with unique motives and ideologies. Explore inner cities, mansions, beach houses, sewers, underground cities, asylums, haunted hotels and more. VTMB allows the player to explore complex moral and existential questions through the eyes of bloodsucking monsters. Contemplate on the meaning of politics, sex, death and life while simultaneously coming to terms with your own monstrosity.You chose to play one out of seven vampire clans, each with their own bloodline weaknesses and strengths. Once you choose your preferred gender and clan, you preliminary fill your skills and abilities sheet.  The choices are endless and incredibly flexible – you can be a femme fatale with a weaponized sexuality, a passionate brawler who persuades people with intimidation and fist-fights, a stealthy shadow dweller that hacks and lock picks their way through each level or a malformed nosferatu who is forced to travel through the sewers and dark alleys lest he risks breaking the Masquerade. The choices continue, and you can mix and match as you please.The main plot of the game is that you were a mortal who has been recently turned into a vampire, a process known as the embrace. The Camarilla, or the ruling class of vampires in Los Angeles, executes your sire for not following the proper siring protocols and for breaking the Masquerade. The Masquerade is an organized campaign enforced by the Camarilla to convince people that vampires do not exist.The Masquerade is the cornerstone survival strategy for Kindred, without it, the humans would rise up and exterminate all the undead. From there on, you learn your ways as a new vampire under the rule of the Camarilla. However, VTMB is a heavy choice-based game with a story-rich plot that allows your character to make decisions that fundamentally change, derail, progress or otherwise conflict with the overall narrative of the game. For instance, there are different political factions, such as the Anarchs you can join that have their own stories, quests and motivations. Doing so will unlock new endings and will allow you to rebel against the standard narrative of the game which is doing the Camarilla’s main quests. This choice mechanic is prevalent in absolutely every aspect of the game. For instance, the one of the first quests you have to do is meet Mercurio, a Camarilla agent you have been tasked with helping. Once you meet him, he will tell you he was robbed. He will tell you that he was supposed to meet with a local gang at their Beach House and purchase their explosives. Unfortunately for him, he went alone, got beat up and failed to trade for the explosives. A dying, bloody Mercurio then asks you to retrieve that the explosives for him and avenge him. Now, upon receiving this quest you can:Fight your way through the Beach House with clan disciplines and/or good ‘ol fist fights and retrieve the explosives.Sneak your way through by lurking in the shadows, avoiding bodyguards, performing stealth kills, killing the lights and retrieving the explosives.Seduce your way through each bodyguard up to the seller. Then, using masterful subterfuge get the gang boss alone by creating the illusion that you are going to exchange sex for goods, kill him by sucking his blood dry and then simply walk out. Or rob the place and then make a run for it – or kill them anyways. Intimidate them through dialogue and maybe fist-fight one to prove your worth. Persuade them through dialogue to set you up an opportunity to trade with their boss and then properly haggle with them (through dialogue) to get a cheaper price and/or potentially for free in exchange for other goods and/or favors. Use certain clan disciplines to control the mortal fools and make them kill each other, then retrieve the explosives. Use certain clan disciplines to speedily break into the window where thee explosives are located, steal them back and run. Or, my personal favorite in the second run-through of the game. Kill Mercurio for being a demanding ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and a screw-up. Get the explosives however you desire and carry on with your quests.VTMB also offers an interesting approach to combat as well – slash your enemies with katanas, sledgehammers, bare fists and more. Use specific clan disciplines to sneak through your enemies, dismember them or enslave them. The game is incredibly well-written, with unique dialogue options allowed and displayed depending on the clan you choose. All in all – buy this game, you will be replaying it over and over again, finding new details, new quests, new dialogue options and new approaches to gameplay.If you enjoy the way I review games, join and follow my curator group!

However, VTMB doesn't limit you to the usual sneak, seduce and feed vampiric stereotype, it allows you to choose between several races of vampire, each with unique abilities called Disciplines which fill a whole range of playstyles and simultaneously increase replayability.I'd definitely recommend it, and I wish I had stumbled upon this game sooner.

												Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, is a near perfect gaming experience despite coming across hundreds of flaws in most every aspect of the game, from the visuals, audio, optimization, rushed mechanics, poor save files, and so forth... Bloodlines suffers from a plagued development, and is far from finished, but comes across as a product both greatly entertaining and lengthy in gameplay. Utilizing the HL2 Source engine, Bloodlines is easily modifiable, and as such many fan made community patches are in circulation around the internet. I highly recommend downloading these patches for a more refined and polished gaming experience (although it is optional as the game is still playable all the way through without said patches). Bloodlines delivers exceptional voice acting, a grim and atmospheric setting, a fantastically agreeable soundtrack, a fair amount of character customization, and at times, a fair amount of role-playing choices, all for a low sum of 20 bucks, and believe me folks - with said amount of issues, it's still very much worth it.

												This has been my favorite game since it released in '04. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes the supernatural (vampires, werewolves, ghosts, etc.), dark humor, and an RPG more akin to Deus Ex than Oblivion. For additional enjoyment, get the Unofficial Patch, which you can easily find via Google. It is still being updated from time to time by a talented devotee who goes by Wesp5. The patch features a basic version that fixes any bugs that have been brought to light and can be corrected, as well as a plus version which includes actual content that was in the game but had not been implemented at the time of release; even pre-recorded dialog and weaponry. I've beaten the game somewhere between 20 and 30 times, you can play as 7 different types of vampire, each of which you can upgrade differently with experience points, which are gained via completing quests rather than grinding kills.How did I forget to mention the characters in my original review? Almost every character in this game is memorable, with many interesting and likable characters: Nines Rodriguez, Velvet Velour, Jeanette Voerman, Therese Voerman, Knox, Gary Golden, Damsel, Romero, Mercurio, Sebastian LaCroix, Chunk, and many, maaany more. I've probably logged at least one-thousand hours on this game on the disc version before it ever came to Steam. I love this game and wish there had been more games from the developer in this universe, but at least I'll always have Bloodlines. <3			"

												More than makes up for the hype. It really is Deus Ex Deux. You can tell it was rushed towards the ending, but it doesn't detract from the rest of the game.Hilariously written, all-star voice cast, and makes vampires look interesting. That last one was probably harder than wrangle a beta version of Source into a TES-like. Gaben is still thanked in the credits...			"

												While admittedly a bit glitchy and possessing some poorly designed boss fights, what Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines offers is an experience. You really do feel like you've stepped into a vampire society, where intrigue and power schemes seem to reign supreme. The game itself sort of exudes a Deus Ex style of play, where you can find multiple soultions to solve a problem and create a character with various strengths. Vampire: The Masquerade is a game I highly recommend.			"

												Have you ever played Deus Ex and thought to yourself, ""This game is great, but it wouldn't it be awesome if instead of a Cyberpunk setting it had Vampires?"" Well that is exactly what this game is like and it has a very complex structure of Vampire that I've frankly, never seen before where there are many different races of Vampire each with their own distinct look, personality traits, and strengths/weaknesses, for example, the Malkavians are absoultely insane and have different personalities talking in their head and see telephone lines swaying constantly in the air and people will be a little off-put by you (if you choose to be this class...this is exactly what you'll see and hear as well along with crazy dialogue options)The gameplay is more or less exactly like Deus Ex with more modern day weaponry and the fact that in order to use your special ablities you need blood which you can either drink a blood pack or find a victim and follow them into a back alley and have a buffet delight.The story is also very intriguing and is inline with the lore from the tabletop games where its essentially about this ancient vampire coming back to life and eating Vampires and causing the end of the world.I'd recommend this game to anybody really and especially those who are a fan of Deus Ex, Vampires, or fans of RPG/Action games. This is another really underrated game that definitely should get more sequels (comeon Activision, I know you have it in your black heart somewhere!) If you see it during a sale for about $10, which is rare, think about picking it up because you shouldn't be disappointed.			"

												This game is amazing.  I actually stood around a radio in this game just to listen to each radio program loop in each game chapter because it was so damn entertaining.  This game is loaded with so much awesome stuff, and the humor in it is great.  It's a shame these guys when out of business, they had the potential to make games as good as anything Bethesda has put out.   A note about all the people complaining about this game needing a patch to run: Of course it does, morons, stop your whining.  This game was made to run on an operating system that's been obsolete for over a decade (and people could argue that Windows ME/2000/XP/etc were garbage when they came out), and the company that made the game was crushed and is long gone, of course you will need to DL a patch to run it.  The good news is that these patches also fix bugs that were originally issues in the game.  So look up and follow the easy to install patches, it's totally worth it (and they are free, so ... yeah).    This game is also worth multiple play-throughs, which can be hard to find with linear story/plot games.  As each clan (and gender) has some different perks, playing through more than once can be rewarding.  And if you haven't played as a Malkavian (the crazy ones), that is always good for a last play-through for the whole game.   Great for any fan of Vampire the Masquerade, great for any vampire genre fan, great for any FP/RPG game lover.  I played this a LONG time ago, and playing again now is just as fun, and it is still an impressive game.  I highly recommend this game. "

												One of the few RPGs where you actually do role play.  You'll want to explore all conversation options because the characters are just that well done.  It looks dated, of course, since it's 12 years old now, and has some annoying bugs, but none of that takes away from the good work that was done on this game.

												This is a great older RPG with a dark atmosphere and interesting background lore. You don't just deal with vampires. Just a few things you do are investigate a haunted house, rummage through a serial killers' abode, and make your way through an abandoned hospital to discover what has been dragging people to the basement. There are also numerous moral choices in the game and multiple endings. The game offers major replayability due the numerous possibilities through clan selection. Although, I reccommend not doing the Malkavian clan or the Nosferatu until your second playthrough given how much they alter the game.			"

												“Remember, wherever we go, it is the blood of Caine which makes our fate.”Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines is a great role-playing game with an immersive dark atmosphere, authentic characters and a solid storyline, that does the game justice. The bloodline (clan) you choose will affect your relationship with other characters, the available quests and the choices presented to you throughout the game, offering plenty of variation and replayability. While the A.I. is simple and pretty straight forward, the game often gives you several ways to solve a situation, including combat, stealth and rhetorical possibilities. The unbalanced combat mechanics are the weakest link of the game, which can create partially frustrating combat situations. The official support for this game was stopped in 2005, leaving it behind with numerous bugs. The fan community has released an unofficial patch, which addresses most of the issues and can be found on the link below (thanks to Voxel).http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647To fix the runtime error, try the following link (thanks to Zzero).http://steamcommunity.com/app/2400/discussions/3/846959521009517711/Fun Fact: The several different vampire clans and their various strengths and weaknesses are based on the tabletop role-playing franchise Vampire: The Masquerade. --My rating system consists of six categories in descending order of importance:-	Atmosphere-	Characters-	Details-	Tactical gameplay-	Story-	Combat & ControlsBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading: -	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorIf the S-Rank is awarded, a quote from the game or personal comment will be added as a token of my respect (in brackets).--Atmosphere: S-Rank(Ah, your’re gonna love this!

												Know that if you get this game, there is a decent chance that it will need some tweaking to even run.  The instructions to do this can be found here.http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=229Talking to people, I cannot pinpoint the reason that some new computers will run it without the fix and some will not.This game is old and the people that made it are out of business.  Steam has posted it up here basically ""As-Is"", without warning us.  While I have the assurance of many Steam users that this game is excellent, I have yet to play it as I haven't felt like jumping through the hoops.Granted that patching or modding older games to work has been a staple of PC gaming for years, shouldn't we be past that in the age of digital distribution? I am appealing to Steam here, you are the future(some would argue the present) of PC gaming distribution, putting a game for sale that has issues with so many modern computers is step backwards.This is the edited version of the review based on input from other users.(you can find my original dissapointment filled review below)----This game crashes as soon as you run it.  If you want, you can follow guides like some kind of treasure map to get it to run but that kind of misses the point of steam.Knowing the bad press that would come from this, Steam requires a 5 minute play-time minimum before posting a review, so I ran the game and let it crash over and over until i got to 5 minutes.  Hopefully I can reach a few people to spread the message that, instead of buying a fun vampire game, you are being the target of an insidious cash grab.Shame on the game's makers for it not being fixed and shame on Steam for selling it.----			"

												I first bought this game in 2005 (back when CD-Roms were still a thing), and have been playing this game on and off ever since. I could talk about the bugs (there are plenty), the glitches (try beating the game without I patch, I dare you) or anything like that, but honestly, it is not relevant at all when it comes to this game, not in 2017 at least. This old, little game that many have never even had the pleasure to hear about, is still supported by a loyal community that have made this game something very special. They adopted a game that was left in a very unfinished state and not only fixed what was broken, but recovered and completed unfinished and unused portions of the game as well as add new content to create a one-of-a-kind game that anyone who loves RPGs, Vampires, Role-playing or just a good game in general will enjoy. The game itself, even before it was patched, is unique and charming. You play as a vampire in a gritty, dark version of Los Angeles. You are given nearly complete freedom as to how you want to play. You can talk your way out any situation, use violence to get the job done, or sneak around and avoid dealing with people altogether. There's 7 ""clans"" to play as, and each one offers a unique experience which is better suited for one style of gameplay or the other (good luck charming your way through the game as a Nosferatu). The characters you meet are memorable, and your dialogue choices really have an impact on how they interact with you. In some cases their lives may even depend on your choices. You'll find yourself hating, liking or at the very least caring about some of these characters, and will remember them long after you beat the game. The locations are likewise interesting, memorable and unique. From the dangerous streets of Downtown L.A. to dark Griffith Park and from the sewers under Hollywood to a haunted mansion in Santa Monica, you will not be bored with your surroundings (even if the graphics are dated). I could go on and on, but you should really see for yourself. Make sure you patch the game, and then immerse yourself in a World of Darkness. You will not be dissappointed and be drawn to this game time and time again.			"

												There isn't much I can say about this game that hasn't already been said, but since this has become one of my top five favorite games of all time, I have to leave a review.There are very few RPGs that have this level of depth. Fantastic atmosphere with fleshed out NPCs. Excellent writing is complimented by voice acting. The clan you choose and the choices you make have a direct effect on how the world responds to you and on how the story unfolds, which has become increasingly rare in modern games. Your choices have consequences that open and close doors. There's a lot of replay value just in exploring the ""what ifs"". That being said, it is an unfinished game, and the gameplay leaves something to be desired. You /have/ to install a fanmade patch in order to be able to even complete the game, which is why I have so few hours logged since I forgot to have it launch via Steam. Even with it intalled there are some bugs that I needed to fix with the console. Combat is clunky and the unavoidable camera change in melee is annoying. Some skills become very unviable in late game. However, I do like the perk system and how there is a real feel of progression. Obviously the graphics are going to be dated since it's a thirteen year old game, but I think they hold up pretty well and it's not a deal breaker for me, especially since I don't own a powerful gaming PC.Overall, Bloodline's succesions highly outweight its shortcomings. If Troika hadn't been rushed and had time to fully develop and complete this game, I have no doubt it would be considered one of the greatest RPGs of all time.			"

												Rating: 8/10 (With Unofficial Patch, NOT RECOMMENDED if otherwise)Great RPG that will totally suck you in (Pun unintended) and get you interested in vampire lore. Plotline - Which is one of the most important aspects of a decent RPG is great and it only gets better with the characterization in the game. All the characters in the game can't get any more interesting as all of them have their own attitude and you get to know their backstory once you talk with them. This makes you relate with the characters than just see them as NPC's. However, the game has more than its fair share of flaws. First - The game is not playable without unofficial patches so you really should download one to be able to even complete the game. Though the game boasts a varied play style (Each vampire clan plays differently), the gameplay is not that enjoyable. Combat is clunky and the shooting mechanics are abysmal. But decent graphics (For its time) and a great soundtrack does make up for a lot of these flaws. So overall, expect a memorable, yet perfectly flawed (And I mean that in a good way) experience that you shouldn't pass on!			"

												This game is an amazing adventure through the old World of Darkness, suitable for anyone regardless of experience with the tabletop roleplaying game. For those interested in that, I'd like to note the world in which this game takes place has been rebooted in a new game, and the current analogue to Vampire: The Masquerade is called Vampire: The Requiem. Some terms and ideas still exist, but the very feel of the world and the themes of the game are wholly different. They've switched from the advertised ""gothic-punk"" atmosphere (a term the company itself uses to describe the old setting) to a more supernatural mystery/thriller feel. Even if you don't intend to play the tabletop game, this is still one of my favorite RPGs, period. Just make sure you go out and download the unofficial patch collection from a mod website. It's still buggy as hell.			"

												Both creepy and funny, Bloodlines creates a believable world and a dark atmosphere (quite gory and sexy at times) accompanied by an awesome industrial soundtrack and score (including Ministry), The RPG/FPS/STEALTH game dynamics are nicely blended through an engaging storyline with several outcomes à la 'Deus Ex'. Definetly a rich game experience you wouldn't want to miss!			"

												Everytime you mention Bloodlines, someone installs it, or so it's said.Anyway, onto the review!Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines has a ridiculous title but that's alright. It's based off a tabletop RPG called Vampire: The Masquerade by White Wolf Publishing.It's set in Los Angeles by night where the player controls their own vampire. There are seven clans to choose from and each has their own ""thing"". There's a clan which focuses on art, one that speaks in riddles, one that lurks in the shadows etc (Also adds replayability!). The PC is sadly not customisable, but it's possible to play as female or male. Gender doesn't have a very big impact on the game, but it affects NPC interaction a couple of times.There's also some crazy ♥♥♥♥ going down in game. I won't be going into too much details but it can be kinda scary sometimes. Also there will be gore, sex and even a snuff movie. And maybe about two jump scares.BUT WAIT. Luckily there's a console in case you really don't want to/can't do something. Hooray!There's no such game as levels in the game. Like a real RPG, there's a character sheet and you can upgrade your abilities by spending experience, which you get from completing quests.Questing is fairly fun in this game. There's no such thing as mindless farming! The first challenge is getting the quest, through picking the right dialogue. In some cases, if you pick the wrong dialogue you're missing out on quests and thus, experience.Quests can be completed in different manners. You can either kill everything, stealth and in some cases just with dialogue, which is nice for the lazy people among us. Sometimes it affects the experience gain though. (For example, getting 3 XP instead of 2 if you aren't seen).Combat is decent-ish, but at least you can switch between first- and third-person perspective.The game isn't sandbox, but there are a few hubs you can go to as you progress through the game. You can travel as much as you want, as you have your personal vampire cabdriver! Awesome!NPCs are all voiced and depending on the clan, even the whispers in your PCs head too! Isn't that fun, you'll never be lonely again! Anyway, it kinda adds to the already dark atmosphere of the game.And unlike a lot of games, choices DO matter, throughout the whole game. If you aren't nice to someone, you might miss out on a quest/experience/ending.The downside is that combat becomes more important as you get closer to the ending. This is probably because the developers were in a rush to finish the game. The vanilla game has some game-breaking bugs even, but if you use a patch by Wesp the game is definitely play-able.There are also a lot of loading screens. Fortunately, loading times aren't long.True, it's not a game for everyone. But what game is? BUT. IN THIS GAME...You'll meet fellow vampires, werewolves, ghosts, zombies and humans!You can be nice, sarcastic, or really mean!Your vampire can dance just as good as you can!Also you can make people explode so their blood is everywhere. Did I mention that? 'Cause that's cool you know.For a rushed game from 2004, it has a lot of mods and some even revamp whole game mechanics. So I guess it's kinda hard to get bored of it.Ten years and going strong!			"

												Bloodlines was damned to be a ""flawed gem"" straight out of the box. Despite a loyal, yet small fanbase creating unnoficial patches to fix the bugs found in the game, it still has a lot to be fixed. The game works on the early Source engine, so it uses to base code for Half Life 2, but the development cycle took different paths from the very beggining. The most notable feature of this RPG in particular is the fact that Experience isn't gained for kiling enemies, but for completing quests or finding alternate or special routes to them. That makes it a lot more that a run & gun game. This is - a true Role Playing Game.Even though this game came out in 2001 it i still by far my favorite RPG and no matter how many times I play it I always want to go back for more. I definitely reccomend this game.			"

												Rating: 8/10 (With Unofficial Patch, NOT RECOMMENDED if otherwise)Great RPG that will totally suck you in (Pun unintended) and get you interested in vampire lore. Plotline - Which is one of the most important aspects of a decent RPG is great and it only gets better with the characterization in the game. All the characters in the game can't get any more interesting as all of them have their own attitude and you get to know their backstory once you talk with them. This makes you relate with the characters than just see them as NPC's. However, the game has more than its fair share of flaws. First - The game is not playable without unofficial patches so you really should download one to be able to even complete the game. Though the game boasts a varied play style (Each vampire clan plays differently), the gameplay is not that enjoyable. Combat is clunky and the shooting mechanics are abysmal. But decent graphics (For its time) and a great soundtrack does make up for a lot of these flaws. So overall, expect a memorable, yet perfectly flawed (And I mean that in a good way) experience that you shouldn't pass on!			"

												Seriously, the writing in this game is among the best in the world of video games so far. Not only is the gameplay fantastic and the story excellent, but the writing, God, the WRITING. The dialogues are amazing, and after you've played through as whatever non-Malkavian clan you chose, you need to play it again as Malkavian for more hilarious dialogue.Oh and don't let my recorded play time fool you, as I own this game retail, and played it a lot before I re-bought on Steam for convenience. It's seriously one of my favorite games of all time, and as far as WRPG goes it up there with Deus Ex and other classics you just get that occasional hankering for.Just, just play it, and then despair as you realize lesser games aren't as fun anymore.

												There isn't much I can say about this game that hasn't already been said, but since this has become one of my top five favorite games of all time, I have to leave a review.There are very few RPGs that have this level of depth. Fantastic atmosphere with fleshed out NPCs. Excellent writing is complimented by voice acting. The clan you choose and the choices you make have a direct effect on how the world responds to you and on how the story unfolds, which has become increasingly rare in modern games. Your choices have consequences that open and close doors. There's a lot of replay value just in exploring the ""what ifs"". That being said, it is an unfinished game, and the gameplay leaves something to be desired. You /have/ to install a fanmade patch in order to be able to even complete the game, which is why I have so few hours logged since I forgot to have it launch via Steam. Even with it intalled there are some bugs that I needed to fix with the console. Combat is clunky and the unavoidable camera change in melee is annoying. Some skills become very unviable in late game. However, I do like the perk system and how there is a real feel of progression. Obviously the graphics are going to be dated since it's a thirteen year old game, but I think they hold up pretty well and it's not a deal breaker for me, especially since I don't own a powerful gaming PC.Overall, Bloodline's succesions highly outweight its shortcomings. If Troika hadn't been rushed and had time to fully develop and complete this game, I have no doubt it would be considered one of the greatest RPGs of all time.			"

												I would like to note that before anyone buys this, it will NOT RUN on modern machines unless you install fanmade patches. ( http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2025035 ) In this day and age vampires are often a mockery in pop culture, thanks in large part to sensations like Twilight. But let me tell you, this game has no glittering pretty boys. It's a true painting of what the modern vampire should be- they walk among us in society because they look like us, often using their intelligence and sex appeal to feed and maintain their powers. The game largely focuses on the politics within vampire society known as The Masquerade- it's this web of politics that sends you off on several quests where, depending on how you've chosen to level your character and converse in dialogue with NPCs can play out very differently. The side quests are also very compelling. And I'm usually incredibly disinterested in these- the lore and the characters are all just so well written it made me want to explore the game more.If you're looking for an obscure gem, excellent writing, unique atmosphere, or just tired of seeing Vampires suck ♥♥♥ like they have been in recent years this game is up your alley.

												It was a bit tough to get this game started because I didn't have at least 15mb of RAM, but after installing the unofficial 9.2 patch, the game ran like a charm. I think during the entire play through I had less than half a dozen crashes. I found this to be pretty impressive considering I couldn't even launch the game after installation.Ok, so if you've bought the game and installed the 9.2 patch, the next step is to mod your female character to look like Jeanette or Velvet Velour ;)On to the game!Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines sounds like a sequel and there was a game before it, but it starts fresh and doesn't seem to carry any baggage from the previous game. You play with roleplaying-style skill points which increase as you buy into the higher levels. Your skills range from melee, to stealth, to guns, to computer hacking, and everything in between!When creating your character you choose between male and female, and then one of many different families. These families give you your vampire powers, like terrifying presence, or moving in super speed.Your job as a newly converted vampire is to do the will of your Prince and leader. During your missions you'll meet so many creative and unique characters. The world you're put into is just so unique and enjoyable from everything else out there right now, it's really hard to describe how this game's story was.Bottom Line: Get this game. If you like great stories and/or role-playing games, then this is a gem I had missed for years and I wouldn't want any of you to miss it any longer.			"

With that said, let me tell you, I installed this game in 2004 and still have it installed today in 2014, I have well over 500 hours on this game and I will now proceed to try and give it another 500 hours on steam and heres why!This is my favourite game, I fell in love with it the second I played it.Its a very dark game that shows you the real world behind our lives and the sugar cotted world where we live in.You will see that this World of Darkness thats all around us Humans, is a brutal world where sex, violence and murder along with a lot more sins are casual things on a normal night in the vampire society.The gameplay is pretty much summed up as a quest based RPG, you have your main quest line but if you wish and start peeking around you will find plenty of side quests and each of them has tremendous depth and unique stories (sometimes sad or gruesome) of their own.You play the game the way you want to play! If presented with an obstacle you can most certantly find diferent ways of passing it and reach your goal, be it guns blazing, charming your way through, beating everyone up, sneak in without murdering anyway, its your choice, you play the way you want to play!This is an immersive game, with a dark atmosphere, filled with mysteries regarding both the main and side quest line and the lore itself of the world of Vampire The Masquerade!From the dark clouds in the nights sky to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s waiting in a alley to the beautiful soundtrack, this game acomplishes in setting the right ambience, dark, violent and seductive!I cannot express how much I love this game and how much I think you all should play it!Its a dark, moody game where you are now the social, brutal and sexual beast behind the veil of the world thats hidden from human sights!

												As true a diamond in the rough as any game you can find here. Well, well worth the time of anyone who's interested in RPGs, arcane / urban / supernatural horror atmosphere, good writing in games or good plotting in gaming. If this is on sale you're cheating yourself if you don't give it a go.The premise in a nutshell: Your character goes on a bender and ends up dead, then undead. Saved from certain (final) death, you end up an investigator / fixer for a secret shadow society of urbane monsters, chasing down all sorts of weird happenings in and around nighttime Los Angeles. Talk, fight, and use your monstrous powers to manipulate or destroy hapless mortals and other, less redeemable things.Let's start with the good: The plotting, writing, atmosphere are all simply amazing. From the marketing materials and screenshots you might assume the game is grim and gritty and oh-so-goth, but the game is, for the most part, incredibly funny. Think Deadpool or Garth Ennis' comics - there's a lot of black humor. Most everybody is dead and loving it. And it's not possible to say enough about how incredible the voice talent cast is, with a small handful of exceptions. Yes, that's Bender showing you the vampiric ropes in the tutorial. If the premise seems ridiculous at first, the game will sell  you on it. The central mystery is really good and the sense of dread builds perfectly.The atmosphere of the game is great - much like Deus Ex, it makes the most of being set entirely at night. There is a definite sense of traversing the city of angels' seedy underbelly - while the rest of the world's sleeping, all the weirdos and club kids and dirty cops and streetwalkers come out to play. If you look hard enough you'll find not just other vampires but stranger, more sinister, and inexplicable things preying on humans. the original soundtrack is very good and mostly trip-hop influencedm and the licensed soundtrack (mostly playing in clubs) is, well... It's subpar goth metal, for the most part, but all the files are in .mp3 format so you can switch them out for whatever you want.*The narrative is composed of several story strands and subplots but is structured in ""hubs and spokes"" - think Hell's Kitchen in Deus Ex or Omega Station in Mass Effect 2. Each city center (there are four) is a large street-level area, thick with opportunities to take on new quests, pick fights, steal money or blood.As with any classic RPG, you have stats, skills and powers that you level up (note that experience is given on quest completion, not upon killing ♥♥♥♥ - it's just as viable, and probably more fun, to play a stealthy character). There are no classes but you do choose a ""clan"", sort of a vampiric race. One thing you'll constantly hear people rave about with this game is how different the game can get based on this choice - most are interchangeable (save for the powers given clans are allowed) but the Malkavians are marked by insanity, and so every single line of dialogue you can give in the game is rewritten as a bizarre riddle (it's fun to talk to NPCs as they try to make sense of you). Nosferatu, on the other hand, are clearly monstrous, and so most every human you interact with will freak out, if they assume you're not a burn victim or wearing a costume.Fighting gameplay is fairly good, though hardly exceptional. This came out before the advent of cover-based shooting so it may take some getting used to. Guns kind of suck unless you really know what you're doing. Melee can be fun but can also drag. Using your powers is always fun, you just have to watch your blood level (basically mana) - invest in the ""brawling skill"" so that you drain enemy blood in the middle of combat. Sneaking is pretty satisfying and intuitive. The visuals are pretty fugly, and the animations in gameplay are bit janky, with the very notable exception of the dialogue animations - Troika took full advantage of the rigging potential of the then-young Source Engine (V:tmB rather infamously released on the same day as Half-Life 2, to its detriment) and as a result the conversations hold up to this day- it's crazy to go from this to, say, Mass Effect and marvel how much more expressive NPCs are here.Bloodlines has its warts - Chinatown is full of caricatures, the lack of polish over the whole product is stupendously evident and a community patch is more or less essential to play the game to its fullest - but believe me when I tell you that there is no other game like this. When it gets its hooks in you, you'll play it to the end, and when it's over you'll wish you could spend more time exploring its strange, sinister world.* If you're going to do this, wipe all the ID2 tags from the file through Windows or Audacity before you insert them in, otherwise the game will freak out and crash.

												Both creepy and funny, Bloodlines creates a believable world and a dark atmosphere (quite gory and sexy at times) accompanied by an awesome industrial soundtrack and score (including Ministry), The RPG/FPS/STEALTH game dynamics are nicely blended through an engaging storyline with several outcomes à la 'Deus Ex'. Definetly a rich game experience you wouldn't want to miss!			"

												One of the most underrated games in gaming history. It's a flawed gem of a game, but the unofficial patches clean the game up really nicely. It has an incredibly interesting story, amazing atmosphere, and some really memorable quests and dialogs. The combat and stealth systems are clunky, but a great effort has been made via the unofficial patches to improve these aspects, and it now works a lot better than before the patches.In summary, if you're up for an RPG with a dark setting, memorable characters, and an amazing world filled with tons of interesting lore, then look no further than this game.

												Simply must be owned by everybody.One of the most engrossing games ever made. If your a Vampire the Masquerade fan you WILL love it, if your not you'll learn to love VTM.It has some of the most memorable characters and moments of any game, and I really dont think anyone would argue with that. It is superbly written, funny, dark, gritty and violent.Buy it! (If your old enough)9/10 (9 because of glitches and bugs)			"

												This game is such a delight to anyone a fan of horror and vampires, the attention to detail of gameplay and storyline for a game of the day and age for once it came out is of a unique high quality.The ability to turn from first person shooter to 3rd person at a moments notice for play style makes it versatile and keeps it fresh, full spoken dialog from characters in the world and questlines, the ability to choose and customize yourself/character from a variety of talents to apply to the game to finish objectives, play styles have a wide variety (be a sneaky lockpicking/hacker, a monster of a vampire with a brutish thirsts for blood and chaos, or a socialite with a sharp tongue for manipulation etc etc!). This aspect makes this game very re-playable, if one would like to explore all aspects that the game can offer.The character creation also gives you a variety of vampire clans to choose from, each with their own personal look and place within the world; special attacks and specializations are given for each clan presented depending on which one you choose from, some clans provide abilities that will help cater to the play style that you would wish to use.The beauty of this game is that they're more than one solution to finish a job and it purely depends on how you want to play the game and how you spread out your talent system. I don't want to give too much away but I highly recommend this game! I also recommend that before you play the game that you download the unofficial patch for the game as it removes some of the ingame bugs. http://www.moddb.com/mods/vtmb-unofficial-patchThe link also has a few cool mods to add onto the game like the Final Nights mod that changes the selection of clans in the character creation menu with all new special abilities and all that good stuff (do this after you play the origianls clans/clan if you are looking for more fun!)It's probably a very short review compared to the grand scale of this game has to offer but I hope I helped someone in convincing them to play this great game :D			"

												Everytime you mention Bloodlines, someone installs it, or so it's said.Anyway, onto the review!Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines has a ridiculous title but that's alright. It's based off a tabletop RPG called Vampire: The Masquerade by White Wolf Publishing.It's set in Los Angeles by night where the player controls their own vampire. There are seven clans to choose from and each has their own ""thing"". There's a clan which focuses on art, one that speaks in riddles, one that lurks in the shadows etc (Also adds replayability!). The PC is sadly not customisable, but it's possible to play as female or male. Gender doesn't have a very big impact on the game, but it affects NPC interaction a couple of times.There's also some crazy ♥♥♥♥ going down in game. I won't be going into too much details but it can be kinda scary sometimes. Also there will be gore, sex and even a snuff movie. And maybe about two jump scares.BUT WAIT. Luckily there's a console in case you really don't want to/can't do something. Hooray!There's no such game as levels in the game. Like a real RPG, there's a character sheet and you can upgrade your abilities by spending experience, which you get from completing quests.Questing is fairly fun in this game. There's no such thing as mindless farming! The first challenge is getting the quest, through picking the right dialogue. In some cases, if you pick the wrong dialogue you're missing out on quests and thus, experience.Quests can be completed in different manners. You can either kill everything, stealth and in some cases just with dialogue, which is nice for the lazy people among us. Sometimes it affects the experience gain though. (For example, getting 3 XP instead of 2 if you aren't seen).Combat is decent-ish, but at least you can switch between first- and third-person perspective.The game isn't sandbox, but there are a few hubs you can go to as you progress through the game. You can travel as much as you want, as you have your personal vampire cabdriver! Awesome!NPCs are all voiced and depending on the clan, even the whispers in your PCs head too! Isn't that fun, you'll never be lonely again! Anyway, it kinda adds to the already dark atmosphere of the game.And unlike a lot of games, choices DO matter, throughout the whole game. If you aren't nice to someone, you might miss out on a quest/experience/ending.The downside is that combat becomes more important as you get closer to the ending. This is probably because the developers were in a rush to finish the game. The vanilla game has some game-breaking bugs even, but if you use a patch by Wesp the game is definitely play-able.There are also a lot of loading screens. Fortunately, loading times aren't long.True, it's not a game for everyone. But what game is? BUT. IN THIS GAME...You'll meet fellow vampires, werewolves, ghosts, zombies and humans!You can be nice, sarcastic, or really mean!Your vampire can dance just as good as you can!Also you can make people explode so their blood is everywhere. Did I mention that? 'Cause that's cool you know.For a rushed game from 2004, it has a lot of mods and some even revamp whole game mechanics. So I guess it's kinda hard to get bored of it.Ten years and going strong!			"

												One of the best ARPG games ever made. It's a ""flawed gem,"" as somebody once said. This game gets my highest recommendation, and is one of my all-time favorites.+ Extremely atmospheric:Each location in this game leaves a lasting impression. From the music to the aesthetics, this game will draw you into it's dark world and have you enthralled.+ Interesting, memorable characters:I can remember the names of many of the minor characters in this game. The characters are all expressive, with interesting dialogue options. I really enjoyed the voice acting.+ Very high replay value:There are many different clans to play in this game, all with their own unique abilities and dialogue options. You'll find something new in this game every time you play it.The only drawback are the bugs, but the worst and most game-breaking of them have been fixed in a fan-made unofficial patch. That said, some bugs still exist, but they're all easily overlooked and in no way stop the progression of the game.			"

												This game is an amazing adventure through the old World of Darkness, suitable for anyone regardless of experience with the tabletop roleplaying game. For those interested in that, I'd like to note the world in which this game takes place has been rebooted in a new game, and the current analogue to Vampire: The Masquerade is called Vampire: The Requiem. Some terms and ideas still exist, but the very feel of the world and the themes of the game are wholly different. They've switched from the advertised ""gothic-punk"" atmosphere (a term the company itself uses to describe the old setting) to a more supernatural mystery/thriller feel. Even if you don't intend to play the tabletop game, this is still one of my favorite RPGs, period. Just make sure you go out and download the unofficial patch collection from a mod website. It's still buggy as hell.			"

												A game every RPG fan should play.It takes place in LA, putting you in the shoes – or heels – of a freshly made vampire. They have a secret society and live among us with a certain set of rules to maintain order and ensure that their existence won't become widespread knowledge. This is the Masquerade. You become the new pawn for the local leader in his political wars. Not all is well in vampire community, and some factions are eager to change things.It's a comfortable entry – just as you're in the dark, so is your character, letting the two of you learn together who's who and what's what in vampire life. It's a pretty crazy one, too. Violence and sex are plentiful and the game doesn't shy from either. You'll find it hard, and not too rewarding, to play your regular Good Hero sort. It's also a very humorous game with plenty of moments that made me chuckle. The voice acting is terrific and there are many great characters. I found myself often just standing still and listening to the in-game news report on the TV, or the late-night radio show for the laughs. The story develops in unexpected ways and the ending managed to surprise me. Maybe I haven't found them out yet, but I didn't feel as if my choices bore significant consequences. It didn't really bother me, though, because the ride was a good one. The game is divided into city hubs that open one at a time after plot checkpoints, and you can jump from one to the other freely once they're available. You won't find the trademark ""collect 10 donkey tails"" side-quests that pollute fantasy RPGs, but instead many fun investigative missions outside the main plot. Backtracking can be annoying, though.While the story isn't too divergent, the gameplay is. It shares similarities with Deus Ex – many missions (though not all) don't offer just one way to the solution. Usually you can take a stealthy approach as well as the loud and bloody one. If your hacking skill is low, often your lockpicking will let you do the job instead – or vice versa. And while, like many other RPGs, it has its skills which aren't as useful as the others, I was happy to find out that many non-combat ones are still well utilized in the game. I won't write down a guide to power-building, though. One, because you can easily google it. Two, because it's hard to suck at the game.You can focus either on guns or melee. I did one playthrough of each, and while I felt that later on my gun-focused character was stronger, the melee was more satisfying, despite how simple it was. I really liked playing an immortal psychopath who charges into a room while people shoot at her and she just jumps around slashing everything. However, just like the graphics, keep in mind the year of the game and don't expect anything advanced in terms of combat mechanics.The game also has serious replay value. I'm already during my 3rd playthrough, and I'm not crossing out the possibility of a 4th sometime in the future. It's not due to different choices, because – as I said – they're not too significant here. It's partly due to reviewing the story with the insight of the twist at the end and partly due to different approach in mechanics – like many RPGs. You don't choose a specific class, but instead a clan. They're set apart by their own few unique abilities (some even have different dialogue options, which is pretty amazing if you ask me), while the bulk of the simple ones are shared between them all. Before you start, two things. First, the game is buggy as hell and you shouldn't play it without the unofficial patch. Google it, it'll come up. Second, don't play the Malkavian clan in your first run – they're lunatics who hear voices, and their dialogue is completely overhauled and special, partly due to their weird insights into matters. So without understanding the plot after a complete playthrough, and knowing what happens in each interaction, playing a Malkavian can be really confusing. But after your first playthrough? Highly recommended. They're very entertaining.			"

The combat is mediocre at best, but on the other hand, the dialogue, characters and story are great. The class system also adds a lot of replayability too, thanks to how different each gameplay can be depending on what kind of vampire you picked. Don't expect to play the game without any issues though. Even with the community's unofficial patches, I still encountered multiple major bugs (bosses went through the level, quests couldn't be completed, characters not appearing when they are supposed to and so on).

												Do not betray the Masquerade, Kindred, for the penalties of alerting humanity to our presence is dire indeed. Vampire: The Masquerade- Bloodlines is an RPG powerhouse. In this game, you are embraced by a vampire clan of your choice and go through late night Los Angeles preying on humans and exploring the grim city that vampires call their home. The story is to die for, the mechanics are phenomenal and the world is incredibly immersive. It's pretty much a perfect 10/10 with memorable characters, distinctive settings and replay value as each clan of vampire plays differently from the others. Two minor things put this game back: The combat system is similar to that of Borderlands and that enough should tell you that it isn't the best way of doing things (it still executes this system better than Borderlands) and in order to even run the game, you must find the latest version of the Unofficial Patch and install it. Other than that, get this game. You'll be wishing you were a Child of Caine in no time.			"

With one caveat.First of all, you must get the unofficial patch, which is easily found and installed. Once that is in place you can start enjoying this absolute gem of a game.It's not the best at any one gameplay element. Melee combat is a bit clunky, ranged combat somewhat underpowered. Stealth is too easy and infiltration a bit simple. But that's exactly the thing - the sheer amount of choice and ways to achieve goals is incredible and puts many far more advanced games to shame. There is very rarely just one way to reach a destination but many. The choice of which clan you belong to (equivalent to choosing a race in standard rpgs) truly matters and makes the game have lasting value. On a new game you can either choose your clan or answer a series of questions to determine the clan. If you decide to buy this game I highly recommend that you answer the questions on your first playthrough.Add to this that the story is pretty good, the plot and progression of the story is great, every choice matters and there are tons of sidequests and you've got a real winner. Highly recommended.			"

												A classic from 2004; Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines can be rough around the edges, but with patience and the user patch (google it, Agnes) it quickly transcends its rushed initial release.It's Troika's last hurrah, give it a try. if nothing else the unpatched cut scenes are worth a chuckle. Also: it has the voice of Bender as an ex-pirate Vampire. What's there not to like about that?Bonus points if you catch the giant reference to John Carpenter's 'The Fog' after the end of act 1.			"

												For those of you who ascribe to the ""TL;DR"" method of reviews, here's basically what you need to know: the storytelling is fantastic, the characters are interesting, the voice-acting is awesome, and while the graphics are a bit dated the game still looks pretty good. It doesn't have the greatest controls, particularly in the area of combat, but it's far from unplayable. 9/10, would highly recommend. It's pure, unadulterated fun.Now, for a more detailed review.This is the greatest game I have ever played. No, I mean no exaggaration, this is not a joke. This is the best game I've ever had the honor to play.Your story is that you're a newly developed vampire whose sire (creator) is executed right at the beginning, leaving you to fend for yourself as you struggle to survive and prove your worth to the head vampire with only your own wits and the help of a few compassionate souls.The characters in particular stand out sharp in this game. They don't feel as if they only spring into existance when you need them there, or like they'll stop moving and living the minute you leave their occupied area. They feel real enough that you can believe they'll keep doing their own thing even after you're gone. They're all interesting and well-developed, with many of them having their own backstories, and some even having arcs throughout the game.The amount of content in this game is ridiculous. It has seven clans to choose from, which makes for a lot of replayability since character interactions, and even certain missions, will vary based on what clan you are. There's tons of sidequests and little things you can do. There's five endings to discover for yourself. Thanks to a vast character sheet, as well as distinct dialogue options, it's easy to slip into whatever kind of character you want to be: a seductive beauty, a cold-hearted killer, a bloodthirsty maniac-- the possibilities are many. This game is good at making you feel like a powerful monster of the night, surrounded by weak, human prey.And all of that is just with the basic patch. If, like me, you choose to go with the Scrolls patch, (I can't recommend it enough) then there's also the option to set it to Plus, which unlocks even more content. I would suggest beginning with the basic for your first playthrough, and then changing it to plus for another playthrough later on. That way you can get a close feel for how the vanilla game works versus how it works when modded slightly.I would also advise that you leave one particular clan, Malkavian, for last. Malkavians are, by far, the most fun clan to play; however, because they are future-seers they will frequently spoil upcoming events in the game, so definitely save them for your final run.Overall, I can't praise this game highly enough, nor recommend it enough. It's well worth full price.			"

												Pros: Fantastic Storytelling, perhaps the game's strongest element. Plenty of options for characters: Strong, Charismatic, Deadly; however you'd like to play, there's a way to do it. A plethora of memorable characters, backed with Excellent voice acting. An engaging plot, with plenty of sidequests: At least 30 hours of content. Unique character development that adheres to White Wolf's game system. Cons: Combat is sketchy. Those looking for a beat-em-up or a FPS will be dissapointed.  The endgame involves a lot of combat, and may be dissapointing for relatively pacifist players. Also, see above. The out of box product is rather buggy, and even the official patched and plus patched versions can have memory leak issues. Save early, and save often.If you get this game (and you should, believe me) Be sure to install either the unofficial patch, which fixes a lot of inherent issues with the game, or the plus patch, which restores deleted content and improves existing content for smoother gameplay. As is, the game includes the 1.2 official patch Patch 9.2 [forums.planetvampire.com]Being one of the finest RPGs out there in the sense that it adheres to Role-Playing,  Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines  Is a must for anyone who considers themselves a fan of RPGs. It has its flaws, yes, but it's a shining example of what interactive roleplaying can and should look like. TL;DR I give it 9/10. Install the unofficial patch. "

												Bloodlines was one of the best RPGs ever developed, but it was buggy and broken as hell when it released, just like the Gothic games fron Piranha Bytes. And just like the latter, it had tremendous amounts of soul pt into it.With the unofficial patch it has become a perfectly playable marvel of roleplaying, although it starts to be lacking by todays standard when it comes to map design and quest depth. Still, it conveys one of the coolest stories and settings we've seen in RPG gaming for the last 20 years and is definitely worth playing until this day. Had zero issues playing this on 4k.			"

												This game is hands down the best rpg I have ever played. The Fable and Dragon Age franchises come close in quality as far as story and ambience are concerned. The one thing that makes this game stand out for me is a preferred aesthetic; gothic vampire fantasy.  As a long time roleplayer within White Wolf's World of Darkness I can tell you not only is this an extremely faithful rendition of that universe, but one which sucks you in with delight at it's wickedness. It is an old game now but has lost none of its charm, indeed there is still a community of modders providing unofficial patches and custom content which can enhance your game. The latest unofficial patch is necessary to make the game play well, it is a notoriously buggy piece of work. All I can say to this is it is worth the effort. Sadly it wasnt worth the effort (to the developers)  to finish making World of Darkness Online, I am still heartbroken.			"

												While suffering somewhat from some bugs and glitches, the game itself is a good challenge, to keep the simple review. You will need to find the patch.Moving to the more detailed review...The intial attempts you may make to load the game could end in heartbreak, as the game possesses a bug which prevents you, or at least prevented me, from playing the game without downloading a key patch. The good news is that this patch is available for free online, in fact there is an extended unofficial patch, also available, which does not prevent the game being played on steam. Not that you would be missing much, the game doesn't have 100% steam compatiable 'chieves all over the place, or much else. It's single player, after all.Once you get into the game you find that there is both a tutorial section - skippable, if you don't mind loosing some work towards stat increases and having to pay for a set of lockpicks - and a guided character creation, which is perfectly good if a little impersonal. You also have the option to set everything yourself, if the guided version did not set things to your pleasure.And then you get to the story, and that... Well, it's hardly my place to spoil it, especially with it's numbers of little twists and hidden reprocussions.You should play it if you really want to find out.			"

												Highly recommended.  One of the best games I have ever played.  Fair warning, It is buggy, the graphics are dated, and it fizzles at the very end because the devs were rushed to release.  However, moving beyond that, this is a cult gem.  It is the only game that gets the RPG elements and first person perspective nearly perfect.  It is NOT a dumbed down game, it is an actual MATURE game that actually earns the M title.  There is sex, violence, addiction, slavery, and many other adult themes.  It is the closest I have ever seen of an RPG pen and paper game brought to life.  This should be the standard that all modern RPG/'first person games' should astrive too.			"

												This game is a buried gem. Activision, as per their hitleristic standards, rushed this game into release about halfway through the development. The result is somewhat painful as far as bugs and glitches go. For me, the game wouldn't even start on its own, and when I initially tried to play it, I uninstalled and felt regret for buying it on my boyfriend's recommendation.A few months afterwards, I installed it again while I had a craving for RPGs.

The combat is charmingly schizophrenic, in that you're never quite sure what you're doing, nor what you should be doing, but gosh dang if the results aren't fun. The combat difficulty jerks up and down with little in game conceivable reason, and initially I was confused, but then I realized that the difficulty wasn't based on game mechanics. It's based on lore. If the game makes you fight vampire hunters, no matter at what point you're at in the game, the fight's going to be very hard because vampire hunters in the Old World of Darkness are damned near impossible to kill. It's a great game, and I think that if lore, missions, writing, and plots are your thing, you should play it. However, don't buy it. Pirate it. A larger company - I think it was Bioware - bought the company that made it and fired everyone who worked on it. Your money would be spent paying the people who ruined the chance of a second game.

												This game sat in my wishlist for a long time before I decided to play it.  My main concern was that I couldn't be impartial.  I love the World of Darkness games, and was seriously worried that despite the many recommendations this game has recieved, I couldn't help but be disappointed.I was not disappointed.Truely, I felt as if I were in the World of Darkness.  The game is a little crowded with WoD lore, but it was fun to see a little bit of everything from hunters to hengeyokai.  The leveling system is almost straight out of the WoD role playing system, which made it easy for me to know what was going on right away.The game's controls never got in the way of gameplay, but sometimes the camera would get a bit confused when crawling through sewage tunnels.  It was all worth it though.  The first time I let loose with Celerity 5 in a room full of ninjas, all was forgiven.I've seen a lot of mention of issues getting the game to run well on Windows 7, but I had no real trouble.  I did get the ""not enough RAM"" error, but going in and changing the compatibility to XPsp2 fixed that right away.All in all, this is a fun action RPG.  While some of the programming shows it's age, the gameplay has aged very well.  I feel that most people will find this game enjoyable, but if you are a World of Darkness RPG series fan, then Bloodlines is absolutely not to be missed.			"

												First off let me say this, i have played this game for many, many hours back in the day when it was on CD-ROM, do not judge the play hours i have on this from steam. One of the greatest Semi Open-World RPG's of all time. That's not my opinion either, many have stated that. The game's depth is incredible considering it was a rushed game back in 2004 and one of the first Source games made. The soundtrack is nothing short of superb and fits almost every mood in the game as well. I could go on and on about every aspect of the game but if i were then you would go into the game knowing what to expect. Just look at the amount of positive reviews  the game has and take that as a good sign, especially considering that practically all of the negative reviews is due to people not using the unofficial patch and fixing all of the games problems, like i said it was a rushed game, but the fact that a rushed game is still one of the best experiences i have ever had in the past 11 years in  a game says quite a'lot.

												Pros:-one of the few fully fledged RPGs to feature vampires (and I'm not even a vampire fan)-interesting twist on the vampires - 7 playable clans, each with their own strengths and weaknesses-nonlinear gameplay - sneak around without being seen or slaughter everyone with a gun-diverse 'disciplines' (basically supernatural powers) - invisibility, charm, induce insanity and more-decent dialogue system-good plot with ingenious quests-strong cast of characters-can be witty at times, playing with stereotypes and such-length - it probably took me around 30+ hours to finish, including most of the subquests (don't mind the hours on record, I often play in offline mode)Cons:-the graphics (that is to be expected from a game released in 2004) - clipping issues are unfortunately quite common-difficulty spikes - very easy at first, can be frustrating at the end depending on what weapons you're using-lackluster and unbalanced combat system - upgrading your melee comabt skills will only increase the damage you deal, the movesets and attack speed remain the same (or improve just slightly); there is also no good reason to choose unarmed combat over melee weapons-hubs offer relatively little to do once the sidequests are finished (justified in that you only ever walk the streets at night)-buggy (be sure to install unoffical patches)-the inventory can be messy-price - about 20 bucks for a ten-year-old game that isn't even a cult classic (albeit, for what it is - a very decent RPG, perhaps it should be)My rating: 7.5/10			"

												Alright, for real though, this is a game that has aged very well. It was a golden RPG for 2004, and today is still Golden. With Troika dead, and before Paradox bought out the rights to White Wolf and WOD, CCP didn't do crap with this series including updates, letting other people remaster it, etc. Luckily this game still has a somewhat active, but small, community, and came out with amazing patches even after a decade of death and silence. There was a project to remake/remaster the game called Project Vaulderie, but unfortunately it got shut down by CCP even though CCP had been doing nothing besides working on Eve Online. The best:-The music is A1. Introduced me to some good gothic metal bands, and the soundtracks for a lot of the hubs are very pleasing. -The dialogue is hilarious most of the time, and it changes depending on what clan you are. -While there was some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting, there was also a lot of good voice acting from well known voice actors.-Clans: There are several you get to choose from, each one has its own special abilities, appearance, and ways you run through the game. -There is no leveling up, you gain experience points and then assign those earned experience points to certain skills you want to increase, which is a simple and nice. -Kind of has it's own karma system to put it basically, you kill innocents, you lose humanity, you lose all your humanity, you go into a frenzy which isn't always the prettiest. So most of the time you have to be conscious of your actions.-The atmosphere was greatly crafted; to be a dark gothic setting. Everything is eerie, not especially scary, but eerie and dark really no matter where you are. -You get to dance like a maniac.-You get paid good for a lot of quests.-A ♥♥♥♥♥ON of lore.The Bad: A lot of this can be excused because of the time it was released, but still mentioning,-The map is absolutely tiny. There are only 4 hubs you can go to, which all are pretty damn small and will take you like 10 minutes to run through all the buildings. -The bugs. Of course, this has to do with the state it was released in, problems with the devs and Valve, etc. But if you don't install the patch that was wonderfully made by fans, then you're going to have a hard time playing because this game is bug heaven.-A lot of the NPCs are the same, there's probably like 5-7 differen't types of NPCS in one city, with 3-4 repeats. -The AI is awful. You can have a decent sneak level and be crouching in front of a group of cops that are on a hunt for you and they wouldn't see you. -The game is fairly short. I think the first time I played this I completed the main and side quests within at least 14 hours. -You don't really get a choice in who you side with. Throughout the game, you are working for LaCroix no matter if you don't like him, but at the end you do indeed get a decision. -You can't really replay this game much differently than a last playthrough mainly because in terms of storyline, there isn't too much you can choose differently, besides minor decisions.-It really doesn't show too much or hint at the enormous amount of lore the WOD and VtM series has. The first time I played this I had no idea that there was a crap ton of books belonging to this series. But luckily, once I found out, I bought all of them. -Because the environment is small and all the work went into the quests, you really can't do much in terms of just exploring. There's not much to interact with. -LOOT. There is rarely any loot throughout the entire game. Which any loot you find is sold for dirt cheap and you get barely any $$$. Overall, a lot of the flaws of this game I can look past because of the age. Lets all hope Paradox does a good job dealing with this series, because it can either go absolutely horribly or incredibly wonderful. And lets hope they don't make a MMO.			"

												Pros:- Awesome hidden gem.- Very immersive game where vampires are actually cool and not edgy sex objects for tweens.- Universe is based on a tabletop game, so the lore and backstory are crazy in-depth.- Themes are dark and mature.Cons:- Falls off a bit in the late game (feels like it was rushed). - Some clans unbalanced. Anyone with 5 points in Fortitude basically takes no damage at the end of the game.- Slightly buggy, but no major issues. There are unofficial patches to fix them.			"

												Hands down, my favorite game of all time! I could replay as every clan TWICE. Sucks for first timers who pick stuff like Brujah or Nosferatu tho. If  you want this game and never played anything like it, I reccomed the tutorial and maybe seeing if anyone you know has pointers. Also for newbs, if you can understand their dialog, playing a Malkavian is essentail! Other than that and the glitchy-ness it can sometimes harbor from being about 17 years old, (it aged well for me at least) it is a game to die for.  <3			"

												The game is nearly ten years old so the graphics are obviously dated but this game is still really solid. It's similar to Deus Ex in that a few months after you complete it, someone somewhere will mention it in passing and you'll curse their name while you reinstall it and play through it one more time. Some parts are really atmospheric while some are extremely frustrating (hollywood sewers, if you used noclip, I don't blame you). The way you can customize your character is really nice too, there are a lot of different combinations you can mess around with. I put 32 hours into it over one playthrough so you can judge for yourself whether it's worth the money, but I certainly enjoyed it. Also, USE THE LATEST VERSION OF THE UNOFFICIAL FAN PATCH, this game is buggy and the patch fixes it.			"

Greater than the sum of its parts; an understatement.On the hunt for another game that plays like Deus Ex (open world, many ways to complete tasks, stealth is almost always an option, etc.),  I fell onto this game.  And I'm both happy and sad about it.  HappyThis game is fun, engrossing, interesting and at times a little creepy.  The setting, SoCal, becomes as much a character as any of the off the wall kindred or kine you meet.  To me, I can't get enough open world games set in present day cities, and this has to be one of the more quirky and shady settings that I've played in recent years. The gameplay isn't as polished as a game like Deus Ex, but not many games are.  If you get past the dated graphics / character design and the not-so-great combat mechanics, you'll be able to enjoy a big world that has a lot to offer, filled with funny and odd characters throughout.It's one of those games that after you beat it, you look forward to the next play through a year down the road.  There are a handful of different clans to play as (which can really change the way you play), but as most people suggest, save the Malkavian clan for your 2nd play through for when you already understand the story.SadAfter you get into the game, learning the basics of the Lore that VtmB has developed over the years, you're bound to want more.  And I want so much more.  This game couldn't be big enough.  I want more chapters, more missions, more locations to explore.  More dangerous encounters.  Hell, take this engine to New York or Chicago or London.  Tell more stories using the already rich World of Darkness universe.The huge problem with all this is that there hasn't been another video game in the Vampire: The Masquerade (or even World of Darkness) universe since this game; 2004.  With so much dense material to create a story with, it's surprising that it hasn't happened.  I'm not sure I would've been interested in the MMO that got canceled earlier this year, but it would've been better than nothing.TL;DR - If you want a game that you can take your time exploring, a game that gives you the freedom to go about completing parts of the story the way you want, and don't mind Vampires as a means of telling a story, then please, get this game.Warning:  Patch this game with the unoffical patch.  It may be a annoying, but it's necessary. "

												One of the most immersive and unique RPGs you will ever find. Imagine if you take the action, skills, moral choises and decisions from games like Deus Ex and Fallout 3, and combine that aspect with a modern world secret vampire society set in the midst of Hollywood - Los Angeles. Then you have the recipe that is Vamire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines.As a newly turned vampire you are off to a rocky start. You begin to unravel ancient mysteries and conspiracies within the society itself. Many clans are at war with eachother, and it's up to you to decide which sides to take. You can either try to resolve things through diplomatic efforts to stay in touch with your human side as much as possible, or go the more animalistic way of violence and murder. But beware, everything you do may have serious consequences!			"

												Notice: the reason the play time is low is because of the unofficial patch mod to actually play it. Details are in the review.(spoken in a dark macho manly voice)""The time is 12:30am or something, i dunno i can't read the time, everyone is trying to mind their own buisness and telling me to ♥♥♥♥ off because i keep getting way too close to them. I'm given another bazillionth task to retrieve some ♥♥♥♥ that will 'definetly' not backfire by some girl i obviously can tell that has dual personalities, but for some strange fate i'm the only one that notices but can't say so because the writers, uhhh i mean God thought i have a perception of a seven year old and gave me a speech impared stroke."" ""I'm still not able to date that girl at the bar without being shuned so hard that i slam through a brick wall, why must i be given the curse of being able to defend myself against an entire army of thugs, and generally being badass at everything else, EXCEPT TALKIING LIKE A NORMAL PERSON TO A GIRL! Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ dating women who think socially awkward men are 'cute', this is how i became a vampire in the first place.""This is a generalization on my thoughts in ""Vampire: the masquerade-Bloodlines"". I played through the game as a  combat hardened vampire with the dating capability of a five year old, and ended the game as a combat hardened Vampire with the dating capability of an eight year old. So thats 1,000 bodies piled up in one night, and 0 women shaged blood sucked through what was supposed to be shagging in a lifetime. But  everything else was A ok, the story was fantastic, the characters were likeable, and the combat was riged but interesting enough to be worthy of a Bethesda RPG. But beating a dead horse five or eight times is not enough, noooo you want to eviserate it and smear the entestines all over yourself. You deffinetly don't want to be affiliated with something like that, so im gona help you look like you do by framing you and calling the cops on you. For now why don't you read the rest of this review while i make sure that your into snuff films.gameplayIf your eyes were too lazy to read the description of the game, you play as a vampire in the modern world. But the game dosn't want to be that kind of game, like the recent fallout game, it want's to be unique and engaging like a hetrosexual. You have your penalties, your overbearing number of skills to track, your journal, blood because your a vampire obviously and your soon to be overburdened inventory. if thats hard to keep track of, pray to God that the police won't arrest you, if not continue reading.Then we got the combat, what about it, like a bethesda RPG, clunky, unpolished but original enough to keep you interested. wacking people sends them flying and slaming against a wall if there is one, and shooting people is as interesting as the new call of duty, the same as every call of duty game. Then theres your supernatural skills, because vampire, and that the affect is what race of vampire you are, like a hetrosexual. Theres a dozen different races, but on my first run i played as a carniverous hippy with Bob Marly enthusiast hair.But where it really shines like a flash bang going off in your eyes is the dialouge. Almost everyone in the game has profesional voice acting (except for the same looking security guards) and have facial animations of melted chocolate being forcefully poured down your throat. The protagonist (yourself dumbass) even has great dialouge that made me actually feel about the scenarios the game passes to me on a silver platter, which looks to me was  suppost to be a golden platter.atmosphereThe world is dark, scary and sleazy like Detroit, probably is inspired by real world Detroit. The game almost looks believable enough to be a real city with bumbs walking around in the dozens and the looks of what was suppost to be a city with imbition is strife with poverty. Hope and kindness is a rare comodity, and even if its not impossible to be nice, conflicting consequences force youto chose between human, or monster. Even the game has a moral meter but instead of getting to look bad, the more evil you are the likelier you are to have no control over you character while they go on a rampage, im serious.But underneath that exterior lies a society of, you already know what it is. The world of the dead always changes the tone of being in a normal place, to being in somewhere where you are powerless. you'll be one minute fighting thugs in the dozens while some will try to flee in terror, then you'll be in a haunted mansion or a house of a crazed vampire, making you sick and spooked at the same time, it actually works very well.Everything from lighting to texture work makes this a believable place, almost at the same levels as 'Deus ex'.negativesBUGS, bugs everyhere even if you start it throws at you a '15 gb of space required' prompt that throws you out like a bouncer at a strip club. Fortunatly i have a solution here[www.patches-scrolls.com]. even if you get that to work your still going to run into problems, like asanine enemy locations and game braking bugs. a noticable one is the CARGO SHIP LEVEL. I see cops everywhere, i sneak past them to investigate something, i try to escape but i don't know how to without killing the guards blocking my escape route and i can't kill anyone. You know what the solution was,  NO CLIP. I had to use it to pass through that level because i tried every solution to get out without getting spotted by the 'highly trained officers' who shoot on site, because making advance ai is hard.conclusionThis game has fantasticly told story with slightly dogy but engaging combat with loads of bugs, but you know what it is. An unfinished masterpeace because the developers were on a tight schedual and tried to cram everything in a reasonably long game. It works for the most part and optimization is great, its a shame that it has so many bugs that would scare alot of players away. I recommend this if you like decent RPG's and don't mind cheating a little.The police are probably there already and your thinking of ways to kill me, well i get alot of death threats so im a popular guy .Ill be in hiding while you plan your escape route, even though i am most likely to get assasinated by the many secret agencies and lives of people worthy enough for a protagonist of a John Woo film.

												37 hours. 37 hours that I played this game without much sleep at all. Am I becoming a vampire?Damn, I didn't even do all of the sidequests. I have to go back.This is one of the best RPG's I ever played, and I hate RPG's. Vampires without bling-bling, why is this not a thing anymore? The soundtrack is just amazing. There are glitches here and there, but they are fun. Nothing about being in the midst of a boss battle, very close to dying and having the boss being stuck on the floor. Come and get it!I saw the dancing werewolf. Got rid of that annoying turnstyle. Who's that taxi driver? Am I holding the phone or am I not?The unofficial community patch is highly recommended. It adds the library mission, which is fun. And much more content the original dev's didn't have time to add - for example, whole new characters and voiceovers.I will play this again and try to do all the sidequests. There are easily 50 hours of gameplay in here, totally worth the price.			"

												Definately a pleasant surprise.  ( 2005 )I greatly enjoyed the game, Unmatched atmosphere and voice acting, quality writing for a game, great replayability. The sheer variety between different clans, their playstyles, using different skills and various approach to your quests is fantastic. Saying this.. Vampire: Bloodlines does not stun the player with incredible visuals, instead opting to impress with Incredible storyline, great gameplay, great soundtrack.How ever it has an active modding community, to ""up the visuals""Urban vampirism Dark.. Girty.. Sexy..   Ocean House Hotel still scares me less. Even though I've played it many times before.  ;_; "

												Vampire the Masquerade, though an old game, is a pretty good game for its time. The story is gripping and exciting, causing me to have some sleeplees nights trying to complete the many missions in the game. It also involves a world filled with werewolves, humans and demons living together in adelicate balance of survival and peace.The story goes like this. When you were bitten by a vampire. you became one. A clan leader took you under his arm and ordered you to perform many missions. Without giving away too much of the story, you will eventually come across three main factions, each with its own ideals and belief. Your decisions in the game will eventually lead to an outcome favourable to one of the faction.The controls are average. The first 10 hours was great. However, at the later stages, the game becomes repetitive as you travel to and fro from your apartment just because of the 'emails'. You will also encounter some bugs but these can be solved by reloading the game. The graphics are really dated but viewable.Game satisfaction is 76%. "

												LOVE this game.It look old and it's a bit janky (particularly combat using firearms, melee is must more rewarding) but the world is amazingly well constructed and highly immersive.This is a world you can get lost in with multiple play style options and great ways to have a completely different experience. If you've already played through and want something different picking a different clan can give open up options and pathways that you previously couldn't have found. Great examples of this are the Nosfertu which prevent you from being seen by human without incurring penalty making you spend the game learning the under paths of the hub areas and the Malkvians who, being insane, replace all of your dialogue options with entertaining non-sequiturs and giving different dialogue from NPC (usually remarking that you're insane).Just make sure you get the unofficial patch which fixes a range of issues and greatly improves the game.

												Really, I don't see the need even to review: the game speaks for itself even all these years later. As I write this VTMB is 13 years old and yet it has stood the test of time as being one of the greatest games ever, the sort of a game whose mere mention on a forum can convince *someone* to reinstall it. It's a damn shame Troika went under, CCP cancelled the MMO, and that it was overshadowed by HL2 as they both used the same engine and wanted Half Life out earlier (frankly idgaf about GabeN releasing HL3 or not but if only a new World of Darkness game...) But, then again, Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines could just be fated to be one of those games where no studio is ever going to own up to the original. To me, it is like the StarCraft of modern RPGs, where no matter how hard they try all the new material would just be crappy DLCs and an underwhelming experience lacking the true love that went into the first.The good:Painstakingly recreated the original gothic-punk noir atmosphere with the right balance of humor and in-jokes (much akin to the original Fallout games and why Fallout 3 is ridiculed by old fans) and perfect atmosphere. For anyone who's ever been a fan of what White Wolf made with PnP and their novels/source materials, this is great, and serves as an excellent primer and introduction for those that haven't. The soundtrack is awesome. Also very well done for helping set the tone of the whole game.Mood in general is very grimdark in the tragic sense--you get less the feel of ""whoa superpowers"" and more the grinding tragedy where existentialism may well be the less angsty and horrid option than the ancient being(s) being very plausibly real, with you as ultimately a set piece no matter how bad you think you are (often literally).The storytelling and character interactions. Just superb writing.Replayability: almost every single person to play this game has gone through at least twice, three times being the average. The replay value is possibly the best I've ever seen for a game that actually follows a semi-linear story. Different clans, dialogue options, and playstyles, with the option of multiple endings means you're likely to only see at most 2/3 of the game on your first play through no matter what you do--and that's just the storyline(s). In terms of disciplines (abilities and spells) and various playstyles, one playthrough is probably 1/4 the content. Make sure Malkavians are one of your runs.The Bad:Certain stats are all but useless and things don't translate as well from the PnP. Most common example is loss of humanity, which doesn't affect a whole lot in the game and is fairly easy to replenish which is not like the original content at all. Still, what is lost in translation is probably unnoticeable to anyone not familiar with the setting. The only noticeable parts are things like Seduction which is an almost entirely useless stat.The combat system. It's not actually as horrible as I thought at first especially compared to KoTOR, but it's still pretty bad, although use of firearms is decent enough and for its time isn't really that bad. Besides, if you're looking for a hack and slash this game isn't for you. The main reason is due toBugs. The game wasn't polished at release so needs a patch. My very first run through had a Kuei Jin stuck in mid air as I slashed him helplessly. Most bugs have been fixed otherwise.Lastly it has had a fairly dedicated community including people from the actual project still working on it after release just out of dedication and love for the game, which in its own right should tell you something.10/10 will probably play again after 3 solid runs			"

												The world Troika built is fantastic, and absolutely oozing with the kind of atmosphere you want in a Vampire RPG. At one point in the game, you'll appear in a room in Santa Monica. I personally sat there for like an hour just listening to the news on the tv, and then listening to Deb of Night on the radio. it's the kind of thing that really brings the game to life. I tuned in every so often to check if there were any new stories. There's also a lot of really memorable characters in Vampire: The Masquerade. All of whom are wonderful to meet, good, evil, or in between. I really liked the setting as well, the game world you get to explore has a really interesting aesthetic that channels gothic horror. From Santa Monica to Chinatown, all the locations have a wonderful look to them. Some with a run-down 80s aesthetic to them that reminds me of The Terminator (1984) and Escape From New York. The asian locations feel like something out of a John Woo movie. They're all great. A lot of the businesses and buildings have really interesting or funny names too, that I just love. The OST is mainly different genres of rock, and is pretty cool, I definetly enjoyed it as well. That's not to say that it is without problems though. While the characters are all mostly well written, and well voiced, a lot of the voices seem to suffer from some audio issues, like some characters randomly talking way too quietly, or sometimes seeming to be talking into a tin can. The character progression isn't stellar either. You only gain experience from completing quests and objectives, and instead of levels, you directly use experience to purchase points in various skills and abilities. Which doesn't sound all that bad, but you don't get to use a skill point that often, and most the changes are negligible. Another thing annoyed me was doors. Walking through doors is a pain. You have to wait for the door to open completely, and it opens very slowly. If you try to go through while it's opening, you'll get stuck in the door way. The combat in this game is action based, and isn't that good either. In fact you'll probably try to avoid it in your playthrough using stealth and the social mechanics. This game is very bittersweet, on one hand the setting is really amazing, and the characters and places in this game are lovely. On the other, Troika being forced to publish the game before it was finished makes it suffer from bugs that make it unplayable (Unless you have Wesp5's Unofficial Patch), and lack of content. It seems like the city zones could have potentially been bigger and better, if Troika had enough time. As they are, they're still great, but in the back of your mind you won't be able to help thinking what could have been, with more npcs wandering about, more places to visit, and more to do. Do I recommend this game? Yes. Even with all its problems, I'd still say that it is an absolute classic and there isn't really another game like it.			"

												This game cannot be compared to other games of the same ilk, and it truly saddens me that the company that made it went under, This game brings you on a story following a young man or woman forced to turn into a vampire and his/her following adventure. Now I don't wish to spoil too much of them game but I will say it lets you choose between seven different playble clans each with their own inherent powers and personalities and even more clans that you see in the world. The mthical creatures in this game aren't cookie cutter definitons and each has its own uniqueness that adds character to the game. The game plays a mixture of rpg elements, such as getting points to add to skills of your choice, getting and saving humanity so that you don't turn more beast than man, and following the masquerade, a set of rules to follow so you dont bring unwanted attention to the vampires. The game also employs first and third person aspects; in first person you get to control the gunplay and you will be spending most of your time looking this way, but in third person you can control your melee aspects which are done extraordinarily well. As in most rpg games you have an inventory in which to keep you weapons, cash, artifacts and other miscellaneous objects in,To say this game is good is an understatement and I still beat myself up for not playing it sooner, and the game only gets better with mods. I am giving this game 9.5/10. Play this game asap.			"

												One of the best game i have ever played. Bloodlines features every night creature we know and love into one good RPG. Story is really cool and makes you want to move forward. You were bitten and turned, now you discover the underground world of vampires and need to learn how to be one of them. The game have a lot of interesting NPCs and characters for you to interact or feed if you so wish. Has a compelling vampire lore built that does not sound stupid or untrue. Combat is real time but based on stats (weapon damage + your skills). You have some vampire powers also to use. Boss fights can be a drag, but are not really that bad. You also have a lot of choices and paths to take. You can almost always choose to go peacefull, stealth or all out warfare (depends on skills). Some missions are scary (especially the mansion one, you will know what i am talking about after you played it) and can range from the basic deliver this in there to complex and engaging storylines.From the start you can choose your race and some features. Add some points in skills you desire. You will also visit different cities and locations.Warning: The game have a memory problem, meaning if you have more then 2gb memory ram, you will need to download the unofficial patch, which fixes the problem and many others, so i would recommend it even if you can run it vanilla.The game is fun and fresh, i would recommend it for anyone that likes RPGs and long conversations and choices ala Mass Effect.

												Seriously a gaming milestone, one of the best games I have ever played. Well made and full of character and intrigue it also features the most frightening sequence I have ever experienced in movie or game format to a point where many people opt to skip the section via the console due to its nature (one could argue if you have played through it once you find it more annoying than scary). It has a lot of great writing and acting in it and the downsides to the game are that it was released before Half-Life 2 and as such valve didn't let them use the fully optimized version of the source engine which led to a lot of bugs. Bloodlines was hurried near the end of production as Troika was going out of business and the combat slog toward the end of the game reflects that. Several people continued to work on the game without pay just to get it as finished as it could be. A fan patch might be necessary for you to fully enjoy this free of some odd bugs but you do yourself a disservice missing out.			"

												One of the funnest games in my library. There's loads of options to choose from, featuring rebels and insane prophets to play as. You can also make things harder on yourself and play a Nosferatu, who can't even walk topside without terrifying the citizens. The game also has loads of dialogue options that effect how people interact with you and what quests are available.

												This game pretty much makes up for every one of its shortcomings, and there are plenty, through pure style. There are some fantastic fan mods that even out the rough edges, but even unmodded this is one of the most immersive games out there, one that throws you into its world and lets you explore its darkest reaches. Rather than excessive exposition, it lets you discover the ins and outs of the underground vampire society yourself, much as an outsider like the player character would have to do. It has a fantastic amount of player choice, and a genuinely good storyline to follow, however you choose to play. Many of the core mechanics are pretty sloppy, and the various skills are terribly balanced. Not to mention an excess of bugs can impede your progress. But if you can ignore, or mod out these issues, you'll find it's the perfect vampire game. Just as the Arkham games make you feel like you really are Batman, this makes you really feel like a vampire. And makes vampires cool again in the process.(As usual, ignore my low recorded playtime, as I've already played my non-steam version multiple times.)			"

The Graphics are dated, but not terrible, the story is great, the music is decent, and voice acting is fine. Considering there are few vampire games to play, this really is one of the best in the genre, and has good replay value.Okay Antitribu mod was great until towards the end where it seemed broken or unfinished so now I am trying the Clan Quest Mod. So happy to hear Paradox Interactive has bought the rights to WOD and will be making several new games and *crosses fingers* a VtM mmo!			"

												Amazing Gameplay, Probably one of the best games of it's time. I still like to go back and play it. There's so many options to choose from. And even after you beat the game. You still have a pretty rough time completing it again. Every action has a reaction. Everything you say, effects how the game will play out.

												This game remains to this day one of my favourites. A far cry from its predecessor Redemption (which if you can get it going on newer systems, i also recommend highly).The game stays very true to the aspects of the PnP game. Rich dialogue with interesting characters. Unfortunately it was developed prior to character skin customisation which ould have been nice, but not the be all and end all. Also can be a bit buggy with 64 bit systems and will require some tweaking, but all in all, one that should be in everyones collection			"

												Easily within my top 3 games of ALL time! A really fantastic RPG! You can play it many different ways unlike some RPG's, you can choose what kind of character you play both roleplay and combat wise. It was a little buggy when it first came out but with the official patch AND the unofficial community patch (which is essential imo) it works like a charm. It's very much a mature RPG that isn't all about elves and dwarves so it's a great change of pace from other games in the genre. Very much recommend if you like RPG's and you can handle a mature game.			"

												So much love for this game. It's a classic in the world of RPGs and has pretty brilliant story execution, but give the game some slack in the graphics and mechanics department, it's still an oldie. The unofficial patch is an absolute must to get around some of the problems for lack of development support post release. Either way, I'd highly recommend playing this - having replayed it after several years made me realize that we are missing so much in the modern age of RPG games... I want some of this old storytelling luster back!			"

												This game is in my top 5 list of all time. I would even give this one the 1st spot. It doesn't matter what kind of genre you're into; if you want to get totaly immersed by a game then get this. The atmosphere in this one is unmatched in my opinion. The soundtrack is one of the best i've ever heard in a game and the characters and the script make the whole thing an unforgettable experience. It can be replayed many times and there are many ways that one can approach things. I actually have this one on disc but i rebought it on steam just to avoid the trouble with the CDs. Another indicator of this game's significance is the fact that, even today, 6+ years after the game's release, it is still receiving unofficial patches. Seriously,in the gaming world there are games and there are experiences. This one belongs to the latter category no doubt about it.			"

												The atmosphere in this game is unmatched. I have vivid memories of walking around in-game Los Angeles, taking in the night-time view and looking up at the sky for longer than I care to admit. Numerous other locations are also worthy of praise, with the Ocean House Hotel deserving special mention for being one of the scariest experiences I've ever had in a video game.The different vampire clans you can play as provide plenty of replayability, and I've played through this game more times than I can count. In particular, Malkavians and Nosferatu make for the most unique experience.The base game is a bit buggy, so track down the latest version of the unofficial patch before you get started. With this installed I haven't had any issues to speak of.Although the graphics are a bit dated now, this game is the most underrated RPG I've ever played. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys RPGs, vampires, or simply a good story.			"

												A staggeringly brilliant game. The story is the darkest and most sophisticated you'll come across in a game, the dialogue is the best I've ever come across in a game, and the Role-Playing elements are brilliantly strong, the amount of options open to you is matched only by Deus Ex. You can clearly see the influence Deus had on Vamp's development, with every mission having several possible methods of completion. While this game is buggy, the fans are still making patches since Trokia sadly went bankrupt after completing this game. You will still experience bugs, and that is the only bad thing about this game, but if you can get past this (and you should) you will find, in my opinion one of the best games ever made. It has a dark sense of humour, and a sophisticated world. Play this game if it's the last thing you do			"

												One of the hardest parts of writing any good review comes from writing the review itself. Every person has their own appeal, games they like and dislike, and reasons for those likes and dislikes. Not every game a reviewer will play will conform to those likes or dislikes, and a review must still compose himself and present a fair and balanced review in spite of his personal thoughts. I bring this up because it is very difficult to talk about Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines (hereafter referred to simply as ‘Vampire') without delving into the subjective elements it presents without sucking all the emotion and personality from the review and transforming it into a technical overview of the game itself. As such, I have divided this game up into two sections, an objective and a subjective one. But first an overview of the game itself;In Vampire you play as a young person living in L.A. who has recently been transformed into one of the undead. Upon your indoctrination you quickly come to discover that the vampire society needs to be very secretive about how they act so as to keep the public unaware of their actions. Before long, though a sarcophagus which may or may not house the remains of a very ancient and very powerful vampire is uncovered and the various vampire clans in the city all begin a secret war of cloak and dagger tactics, each trying to recover the sarcophagus and its contents or deny them to others for themselves, all while trying to keep their very existence secretive from humans.Firstly, for the objective. The game is VERY well designed and it shows in its game mechanics. Serving as a action RPG with elements of The Elder Scrolls (except less open, confining the player to four primary districts that are fairly small and multiple dungeons) it is solid right from the get-go. From the beginning you are forced to select one of a series of vampire clans, each offering its own unique set of bonuses, abilities, and disadvantages that will end up shaping how you play. I, personally, ended up going with Clan Ventrue which focuses a lot on persuasion, but can't feed off of animals and can only feed reliably on upper-class humans. Someone else may end up with Nosferatu which can't raise their appearance at all and has to avoid being seen at all by humans for example.The gameplay itself is fairly solid with most of the controls being very tight and having almost no real problems beyond a few glitches (which I will cover later) which I can't blame on the controls. One of the interesting things is that, instead of leveling up stats like strength and such, the player instead levels up various skills and abilities which, in turn, affect stats. This can cause for some very interesting outcomes where a character may choose to level up a skill they don't intend to use at all to bolster another skill which they do, in fact, use and results both in a large amount of flexibility and interesting builds as well as a drive to experiment around and see what else can be done.Another interesting thing is that players do not gain experience from killing enemies in the slightest, but rather from quest completion. This puts an added drive to complete even simple sidequests as the added experience is the only way to make your character stronger.Lastly, there are two special meters that will need proper attention. The Humanity meter and the Masquerade meter. A large focus of the game is the focus on struggling against the vampire urges and keeping ones self ‘human' despite needing to drink human blood in order to survive. Certain actions can cause players to lose some of their humanity and, as the gauge lowers to 0, it can result in them becoming utterly feral. Meanwhile, keeping the humanity high can result in a weaker vampire who struggles with their new nature. Additionally, keeping ones actions as a vampire secretive is very key and, every time a player is caught being a vampire in public, it costs them on the Masquerade meter. They start with a set amount of chances and, if those chances ever all disappear, game over (going feral wastes a chance). This puts an added focus on keeping ones nature as a vampire truly secret and staying human as going feral at the wrong time on a player who didn't try to keep hidden can cause an outright loss.Visually the game is fairly solid as well. While, sadly, you won't be able to delve too deep into the many complexities of polygon count, it very successfully manages to convey the feeling of the World of Darkness (the world as a vampire sees it). Vampire does its best to drive this home too, but manages to back it up with some solid displays. While they may look a bit dated today, there is a HUGE difference between ‘dated' and ‘bad' and this is most certainly not the latter.There are some problems with the game though. First off it seems to revel in giving vague directions and not giving you anything resembling a quest-marker. While this wouldn't normally be too bad of a thing it is very easy to end up lost and unsure of where to go or who to talk too, especially if you stop playing the game for a week or more and don't remember the location of an important NPC with the lack of a map (aside from some bus-stop signs) driving the annoyance home. But, more overbearingly, is the glitches. There are a LOT in this game, and they are NOT of the minor kind. These are the kind that can destroy a game and leave it unplayable. Hunting down a patch and/or activating the command console may very well be a requirement for this game.And now for the subjective. This is a dark game. A VERY dark game to say the least. The game makes sure to reinforce this with such locations like abandoned hospitals, scummy apartment buildings, sleazy motels, brothels and night clubs galore, and death around every corner. The streets are almost never clean and are littered with trash, bums and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s seem to be the most common ‘professions', and so forth. People looking for a game about sparkling vampires, or even just ‘normal' vampires may find themselves off-put easily. This is a very dark and pessimistic game, and it ended up causing me to rethink about how to score this.To say that this is a bad game simply because it's world is so scummy and grim is shortselling what the game does right. In any other setting where you can count the number of people who are ‘good' on more than one hand this probably would have been an amazing title. However, this game does not hide for even a moment that this is a grim and depressing world. People not looking for this sort of thing specifically can very easily end up becoming disguised and/or offended by it. Even the ending of the game seems to love rubbing in just how dark this world is.As a result, I feel it is VERY important to look into the game before buying it and deciding if you wish to play a game like this. While it can be enthralling for people who revel in its darkness, for those people looking for even the tiniest ray of light and hope, they would be better off searching elsewhere.In summery: while a solid game that is mired by some technical problems, its subjective aspects and story may simply be so off-putting to a player who does not enjoy its dark and grim world as to not make this game recommendable on a whim. If you buy this game, you should know what you're getting into, because this game is in no way shy about tossing you into the shadows.My pricing: For someone looking for a dark game: 15-20 bucks. It's very solid, if a bit dated and dealing with bugs.For someone not: Avoid at all costs. Remember, this is a game where it is possible to lose because you couldn't pretend to be a human being instead of a blood-sucking monster well enough.			"

												This game is god tier good. Had it on a disc that got used til the point where the disc stoped working, bought it here again and would probably buy a remake of it if it ever got remade. The only problem with the game is that it has to be patched in a horrible way to get it to work as the game ism't compatible with anything anymore. The patch is fan made as the game was patched like 1 time or something like that. I think it was because the devs went belly side up allmost as soon as it came out. Also, it's really good			"

												This is one of those underated games. Even if you don't like fantasy stuff or vampires, this is one game you're going to love especially if you're into First Person Shooters with RPG featutes. Anyone who is into games like Fallout or Skyrim will like this unknown gem. You play as a vampire who was recently turned and a result must learn the ways of the vampire. This isn't your regular vampire game. You must blend in as a human and learn skills that benefit you throughout the game. You gotta learn to hack computers and break into locks along with supernatural abilities like blowing up people by boiling up their blood. Not only is the gameplay fun as hell, but the storyline is actually pretty interesting. Learn about different sects of vampires and choose who to side with. Be wise, as some choices are harder to keep than others.			"

												If you haven't already, playing as a Malkavian is a must at least once. Though maybe not the first playthrough :P-You speak pretty much entirely in riddles and it's interesting that some of those subtly foreshadow what's going to happen. Lotta great dialogue options for Malks-Creepy ♥♥♥ whispers in the background. Scares the crap out of me on a regular basis-The TV newscaster breaks the in-game fourth wall and addresses your character directly quite a few times. Scared the crap out of me the first time-Beatles references when you speak with one of the NPCs, Skelter.-You can argue with a ♥♥♥♥ing stop signAlso, one of the endings (for all clans, not just the Malks)you can literally tell everyone to ♥♥♥♥ off because they've all been using you. I can't even say how much I loved this because it's like seriously. I'm not your errand dog.Be warned though, it's 12 years old and super buggy. Bless the lovely, wonderful community for the mods and patches or otherwise this game would probably be unplayable as Troika went out of business about a year after this came out.

												While I've not played any game taking place within the Vampire: The Masquerade universe, I was pleasantly surprised by the attention to detail this game in particular had. It was a unique experience, giving me a more contemporary feel of vampires in modern settings, even ones as ugly as the Nosferatu. Hell, even  finding vampires of Asian descent  was an interesting thing to find out. Not to mention how long the game is and how extensive some maps could be, Bloodlines proved to be an adventure worth finishing. That being said, there were some parts of the game that just felt either...off or just broken. While it didn't detract from the overall experience, they were buggersome to have to deal with. Let's break this down into two lists: Pros and cons.Pros:Intriguing story. The ability to mold your path by the choices you make and the factions you choose to aid make the game replayable quite a few times. Multiple paths. As stated above, you can go a completely different route the next time you play just to see how things would've ended.Playstyles. While some types excel in some fields, you're completely capable of being any build you desire, which is a nice bonus to have when figuring out what you wish to be good at. Unfortunately some builds just don't work as the game progresses, which I'll cover below.Theme and enviroments. The world is pretty well done. I didn't expect source to be capable of this kind of detail, major props to the devs. When you walk into the different maps, the different atmosphere feels refreshing too.Characters. I was impressed by the characters and the people voicing them. They were really aggressive and sold their roles enough to make me wish they had more to say. Honestly, I feel this is the biggest selling point of this game.Cons:Combat. Gotta say, the combat in this did not age well. It just didn't feel very engaging to shoot jerkfaces from a distance, nor was it fun to engage in melee combat against things that could very well kill you. The weapons were fun, sure, but it felt somewhat boring.Builds. You can pidgeon-hole yourself if you do not build your character correctly. If you go mostly charisma, you will melt later on. Buffs don't seem to make much of a difference if you don't focus your points into boosting them, which can either interfere and flatout make your build a mess. Imagine having to fisticuff a boss but doing almost no damage. Argh.Story and ending. While interesting, the story felt like it tossed elements at you without really explaining much. Like  the werewolf attack . And while multiple endings exists, only one is worth bothering for, and even that can strain the nerves.Bugs. There are some game-busting bugs that were never fixed in the official release and either need a third-party tool to fix or flatout cheat to get past some triggers that just do not function anymore, which was a big detractor for me.That said, the game is pretty solid and still fun to play, even today. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking to play a game involving vampires and guns. "

The story is so enriching and the characters are fantastic, there are bugs but you can look past them, This game is in my top 5 games. Im pretty critical when it comes to games so if your looking for a game that will keep you busy for days and still keep you entertained this is one you should check out.			"

The Broken MasterpieceDark thematic atmosphere. Great writing. Memorable Quotes.This game is one of the greatest RPGs ever. I can't recommend it enough.Why haven't you heard of it? Well V:TM was unfortunate enough to be released at the same time as Far Cry, Half Life 2 and World of Warcraft, and so it became totally eclipsed.*IMPORTANT* V:TM requires quite a bit of patching and bug fixes, so if you don't have the time/interest to fix the game, don't get it. It's a mess without the fixes. But even with all it's imperfections and glitches it delivers an amazing lore, story, humor and experience. The combat isn't the best (it's over a decade old, what do you expect?), but the story and dialogue more than make up for it.TL;DR: Amazing RPG game, which offers very atmospheric gameplay, funny and clever dialogue, lots of interesting sidequests and hours of fun.

												OK, first off, you will most likely need a patch just to run this game. Unfortunately when this game was originally released it was full of bugs & I guess Steam doesn't provide any fixes but don't worry there is a solution. Go to the forum or the website patches-scrolls and install Wesp5's patch version 8.9. This person has done amazing work to not only get this game running but provided many fixes for any in-game bugs. And it's worth the extra bit of time it takes but first off the bad stuff. The first thing you will notice are the outdated graphics but they really are not that bad and you get used to it pretty quick. The worst thing is combat. It's a bit clunky.....actually, it just plain sucks but not so bad that it's unplayable. The thing is VTMB is billed as an RPG & it not only delivers but it may be the best game ever in this aspect if you like getting immersed in an excellent story. There are rules you have to (un)live by & consequences if you don't. Decisions you make early on reflect what happens later. Basically, in a nutshell, it's an RPG that truly allows you to roleplay who you create & that's what makes this game shine.			"

If you can overlook the game engine and fighting (sometimes nearly impossible to navigate), the story line and character interaction are awesome.Want to be a noble, nose in the sky vampire? No problem, we got you.Want to be a vampire with an overwhelming case of 'The batshit crazies'? We got that in spades.I've been playing this game for a while now, and have yet beat it on 'every aspect'. Would highly suggest.			"

												Despite its quirks (graphical hiccups, repeated NPCs, wonky combat) and the absolute NEED to mod V:tM-B in order to run it on modern systems, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is, hands-down, one of the best RPGs - and possibly the best vampire game - ever made. Simply put, LA does not give two hoots about you, and events are only driven forward when you begin to interfere. Nevermind that vampires have generally fallen out of favor amongst gamers - this is one that should be played through at least once. Lust, hunger, betrayal, and hard decisions - its all here.Expect to die at least a couple of times; the game doesn't pull its punches, and will backhand anyone thinking they're running on rails. The game's world may seem small, but given that the game is over 10 years old now it has quite a bit of space to roam. Maybe not Witcher levels of freedom, but very few of the game's quests are (or really feel like) fetch quests. The things you do change how the game plays, and each Family has their own oddities to them - both good and bad.If there ever was a game that needed a graphical (and gameplay) overhaul, though, it would be this one. The visuals, while striking, are severly dated, and you'll see the same bums/hookers/random people begin to repeat over and over after a while (although it does give the feeling that the city is beginning to mess with your head). As well, the combat system feels severely tacked-on, and while functional, it is almost ALWAYS preferable to go in with a gun rather than a bat or blade, as melee combat suffers the worst. While it only becomes troublesome in a few areas, those can be the places that make one throw the keyboard in disgust. Finally, as mentioned, the game will NOT run unpatched, so picking up an unofficial patch is necessary to run it on a system with a Windows 7 or newer OS (not sure about Vista; it might work, but it definitely doesn't on W7). Attempting to run the game unpatched causes many issues, so don't even think about it.Overall, though, it is worth picking up (especially when it goes on-sale), as it was Troika's last game before they went bankrupt, and while buggy their games have managed to pick up cult classic status over the years. Beyond that, its a damn good convoluted tale featuring the children of the night, and certainly deserves praise for making the player FEEL like they're a bloodsucking monster.			"

												What can i say about this game...Imperfect beauty.Even with all the glitches, bugs, and any other annoyence within the game, it is one of the best RPGs i have ever had the pleasure to play. This game straight up toppled Fallout from my list of RPGs i love, and took the spot of number 1.The game itself is low detail, with many bugs (at one point random furniture spawned throughtout certain areas, and if i looked into the sky i would see what looked like the shadows of furniture and people in the sky xD) but the bugs would rarely effect gameplay and since the game saves after ohmost every time you leave a Building you can take a few steps back, if you ever come across a bad bug that really stops you in your tracks. I only ever had one bug that was like this but i didnt even need to load to a previous point cause it was done for me when i was killed by a couch xD(invisible wall kinda deal).Now if you have been reading up on this game you know that it was never really polished off cause of the developers departure from gaming, luckily a rouge developer by the name of wesp5 took it upon himself to create an unofficial patch that rounds off quite a bit and adds in a few things previously unavailable. Now a lot of people can play the game without the patch but i see no reason not to get it since it adds more to the game(just a little bit). Some people are afraid of going outside of steam to fix their games but its not that hard to find a reputable site. I got my patch from http://patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647 and remember to download 9.0 and install it into steam (itll try to install it into a file that dosent exist i.e if you actually had this game on a CD)			"

												The unoffical Patch fixes basically everything, with all of the glitches fixed, this game is an absolute gem, If you love vampires it's for you, if you love rpg's it's for you, If you love both then, I imagine you already know you should have this game in your collection. It lacks a proper character creation tool for customizing facial details and hairstyles and what not, but that isn't really an issue as most of the pre made characters are mostly spot on. The story is rich, the mini games like computer hacking feel fantastic, not frustrating, and the characters are interesting enough that once your into the world you never want to leave. A must buy, especially if it's on sale.			"

Melee combat is overpowered, though, since you can beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of enemies while they're down. I'm playing a Nosferatu, which means I have to hide in the sewers a lot to avoid breaking the Masquerade. Why do so many Malkavians have Multiple Personality Disorder?

												A good first-person rpg, just make sure to get the unofficial patch as Bloodlines adheres to Troika's grand tradition. Gameplay is reminiscent of Deus Ex, as experience is awarded for completion of objectives rather than kills. More often than not you are given the full range of choices in how you complete your objectives, ranging violence, stealth and social. Character advancement is an adjusted version of the old Masquerade pen'n'paper system.			"

												I mostly love this game for the world created for it, and the stories contained within that world. Besides that, it's got memorable characters, a good soundtrack and can be funny at times, both on purpose and accidentally (keep in mind this was released in '04). Combat gets repetitive pretty quickly, so I suggest trying to kill enemies without being detected to make things a bit more intense. I also suggest to not bother with guns and stick to melee (always collect any dropped weapons though, so you can sell them later). Plenty of sidequests to keep the main narrative from getting boring, great character sheet. I recommend the hell out of this game.			"

												I wasn't expecting much when I purchased Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines considering it's almost ancient status, having been published in 2004 however, this game delivered way more than I expected. The graphics are outdated, but for it's release date, they are actually quite good. The storyline is interesting and engaging, the controls are smooth and the game has an overall excellent flow to it. The combat could be improved a bit but for anyone that enjoys RPG's, I would HIGHLY recommend Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. 9/10.			"

												This game remains to this day one of my favourites. A far cry from its predecessor Redemption (which if you can get it going on newer systems, i also recommend highly).The game stays very true to the aspects of the PnP game. Rich dialogue with interesting characters. Unfortunately it was developed prior to character skin customisation which ould have been nice, but not the be all and end all. Also can be a bit buggy with 64 bit systems and will require some tweaking, but all in all, one that should be in everyones collection			"

												Easily within my top 3 games of ALL time! A really fantastic RPG! You can play it many different ways unlike some RPG's, you can choose what kind of character you play both roleplay and combat wise. It was a little buggy when it first came out but with the official patch AND the unofficial community patch (which is essential imo) it works like a charm. It's very much a mature RPG that isn't all about elves and dwarves so it's a great change of pace from other games in the genre. Very much recommend if you like RPG's and you can handle a mature game.			"

												As long as you download the Unofficial Patch (which you can get off of Steam, or just Google it) the game is very enjoyable. Played through it 3 times. Once as a Tremere, once as a Malkavian (my favorite playthrough), and once as a Nosferatu (the most difficult imo).Hopefully someone in the gaming industry plays Bloodlines in the future and gives the game a sequel, or even a remake.

												If you play RPGs not only for incredible loot and skill tree leveling, but also for the sake of role-playing a character and taking in the atmosphere, this is the game for you. While you do gain experience, and unlock new abilities, the skill tree will be unfamiliar to those not already versed in White Wolf's pen and paper games. Also, there is very little gear, whether dropped or bought and it almost feels scripted. You get to a new place, and get a new weapon or armor, at the same time on every character you make. The only other bad point i'll touch on is the combat system. While it's fun hacking away in melee, and the vampire powers you get to back your fighting skills are top-notch visually and mechanically, if you specialize in guns, expect to have a REALLY hard time until about halfway through the game, even if your ranged skill is high. On top of that, even when your wielding a trusty baseball bat knocking some punk to the floor, you literally have to wait for them to get up to strike again as the hit-boxes don't register when they are prone. But those a few minor annoyances, and really aren't the spirit of the game. You can get through many missions without physical confrontation if you are socially inclined, or can make people magically go insane. The characters you meet all have a story and each one's personality might clash with another or even yourself. It's a great opportunity to really role-play a vampire and a must have for anyone looking for more than a run-through guns blazing type of game.			"

What's not to love?  I'd give it a solid 96% rating.  now the bad The graphics while being competitive for today's games (it used source engine)  is looking dated also having switched to a wide screen monitor reccently I noted it has no wide screen resolution support. A bit disapointing considering many games  even older ones from 2002-3 had wide screen support. The game was released in 2004 about 4 months before half life 2 was even out, making it the first comercial game using valve's source engine (though they licensed the engine so this game was not developed by valve) This game is really worth a go for vampire and rpg fans alike.

												Fair warning: this game is incredibly buggy and you will need to install unofficial patches to get it running stably under Windows 7.The piece of advice I see given to new players most often is that you should not play as a Nosferatu or Malkavian during your first playthrough. In the former's case, you are not allowed to be seen by (let alone interact with) human NPCs, turning the game into one of stealth, and in the latter's case, you are literally insane. There is literally an entire game's worth of dialog written exclusively for Malkavian players.This speaks volumes about the game, I feel. The game can play COMPLETELY different depending on your character and the style of play you choose. Because exp is awarded for completing missions, so it doesn't matter whether you progress through persuasion, stealth, or bashing someone's head in. Nobody plays this game just once.tl;dr it's deus ex with vampires			"

I want to sell this game to You and not in a Wall Street meeting room way, that would not work. So, change of pace OK? Let's see what is sooo coool about VtMB:1. graphics (partly): did You think a decade ago how well the faces and facial expressions of Alyx or Breen were made? Wait for ol' pirate Jack (he is in the tutorial so You do not have to wait much) and You'll change Your tune.2. music, atmospheric sounds and voice acting: they are superb. I only read about the World of Darkness, but they represent well how I just imagined it.3. writing: those Troika guys really know how to sketch up a completely believable character - with only a few lines of dialogue. The story is also great, the quests varied, entertaining and inspired.4. RPG elements: it seems that the developers tried to contain as much as possible of WoD in one game, 7 playable clans is very much respectable, adds immense replay value and a great number of combinations to achieve Your goals. Character development is seemingly simple but understanding it a bit more deeply may lead to some head scratching. Meaning it is good 8).5. quite a selection of vampiric capabilites which complement Your melée wapons or guns. lots of guns.6. nice selection of occult items which enhace Your capabilities.7. Have you ever wanted to......feed on innocents and baddies alike?...steal others' lifeforce from afar?...have a pretty pet ghoul to feel Yourself the center of the universe?...sell a bubblegum and some blood to an idiot who thinks these will help with his vampirism?...lure girls into a dark alley to... to... suck on their neck?...boil Your enemies blood so they explode?...steal drugs from a hospital for the junkie owner of the local pawnshop?...bring peace to a ghost who haunts an old, abandoned and spooky hotel?...damage invaluable paintings?...get a suitcase from under the nose of not one but two gangs for the local arms dealer?...assassinate a russian mob boss boondock saints style?...send a swarm of insects or bats to destroy Your enemies?...lure an annoying tv personality to the hands of a cannibalistic vamp?...do favors for the boss of the most monstrous vamp clan - for posters with some female in-game characters scantily dressed?...destroy a snotty restaurant's reputation?...move faster than Neo?...get love letters from a centuries old vamp 'exotic' dancer?...kill a score of zombies?...use a bush hook to kill the baddies (and goodies)?...destroy the reputation of a celebrity and drive her into suicide?...help out a plaid skirt japanese schoolgirl with destroying a fish smelling demon?...get a pair of human eyes for an evil little old man?...play a character whose talk even You barely understand? (Play Malkavian! 8)...collect the blood of Your victims into a perversed half-alive creation for later use?...have 5+1 different endings?...then this game might be just for YOU!(How was the sales pitch?)Partly due to its troubled history however the game has its problems. The bugs were well wiped out thanks to community effort but still has minor annoyances. Nothing game breaking but like e. g. when You face a boss, there is some talking and after that You have to reselect Your weapon. Things like that, nothing major.Steam has the latest official version, some of the major bugs were addressed in that but You would probably do Yourself a favor installing one of the community patches:True Patch Gold aims to totally conserve the original gameplay while addressing the bugs.Unofficial Patch has two flavors, the basic patch more or less does the same, though some minor changes were made to the original to make some things more logical. In the expanded 'plus' version (it is one download You decide which to use while installing) however the creators tried to restore and even recreate much content cut from the final game, including places, weapons, abilities, weapons, dialogues, quests etc.If You are a purist and want to experience the original game, True Patch Gold is for You.If You do not mind a few changes but want the original experience, UP basic might be the way to go.If You want to see the game as what it could have become if not for its troubled history, choose UP plus.And please, please do not ask in forums which to choose, the above should be enough information. There is a years long flame war involving the patches, their creators and their supporters. Don't spill oil onto the flame. It is a shame, both are great, took up a lot of time and work, both deserve respect. As a closing, a few notes, hints, advices:- save often. Really. There is a quicksave function, You can have a few, it is nat too hard to press F5 (or whatever).- spend some time studying the character sheet and understand how feats work, what adds to them etc. Don't throw around Your points, there won't be that many.- understand how skill books work so You can get the most of them.- specialize. It might be hard, You'll need some unarmed to feed, also there is a quest which is very hard without celerity discipline or ranged - on the other hand the game seems to push You toward melée.- have spare XP points unspent as many as You can. The amount in later game may go up to 50-60. You never know when You'll need to spend a lot to buy in to a skill that You need to complete a quest to Your satisfaction. You WILL need for example high computers and lockpickig, if You spend all Your hard earned XP on fighting/social skill You will be in trouble with side quests, maybe even main ones. Btw, You might think that the game will throw a lot of XP at You later in the game, it won't. Conserve.- if You are completionist, and Your ego can stand it use a walkthrough, otherwise there will be a lot of saving/loading and running around. You don't know beforehand which solution to a quest will yield the best reward. Dialogues are also unfriendly: if You choose the wrong line You might never get to the option that gives the best option. Also NPCs are rarely very clear concerning their wishes. If they hint that it would be appreciated if You did X quest without bloodshed that means that You SHOULD do it that way for the best reward. They are often not even this clear.- if You want to have all endings as an option in the endgame You have to forget about roleplaying and go for shameless bootlicking and say to all major players what they want to hear, all the time.This is it. Well, not much of a review, but at least it is long 8).PS: If You liked Bloodlines You might also want to try Redemption. Even older and uglier and starts a bit slow, quite different from VtMB but has its good points, a very enjoyable experience. VtMB is available on Steam, VtMR on GOG.com. "

												Currently the main game I am playing at the moment. Personally, I am fascinated by vampire lore in general and Troika Game's adaptation of the pen-&-paper-role-playing-game, Vampire: The Masquerade has so far been really entertaining. I have heard that there are unofficial patches and mods for this game that have been developed by fans since unfortunately Troika Games is defunct (The same folks behind the first Fallout game), but I intend to not use any patches for my first play-through, I might in the future however. Some people would turn away from this game because there are some bugs in this game such as uncooperative doors and quest logs that don't always update. To my understanding this game was a bit rushed and was pushed to be released the very same day as Half Life 2 being the first 3rd party developer to use the source engine. So while you play this game just keep in mind, this is a game from 2004 (10 years ago). I am currently playing a Nosferatuean Vampire whose core mechanic is using stealth (google Nosferatu vampire and you will see why), you can choose quite a few different vampires however, such as Ventrue, a high class vampire who uses charm and persuasion which gives you a more diplomatic sense of playing, or a Malkavian vampire who is bat♥♥♥♥ crazy with hilarious dialogue.This is a good game, but don’t get this game for 20$. You can afford to wait, this game frequently is 75% off on steam sales. It will probably be on sale this Winter Steam Sale.			"

												This game has its flaws, mostly technical flaws. In order to make this game function on most computers, you must install a patcher to make the game actually run on your machine. If you make a quick google search, you'll most definitely find the installer. However, underneath all the technical problems, this game is an absolutely great, mostly because of the RPG elements implemented within the game. You start the game by either answering a few questions that affect your character's stats, or you can spec your character yourself. The atmosphere of VTM:B is fantastic. I find the word ""immersive"" pretty tacky, but that's exactly what the atmosphere feels like. Once you've invested a couple of hours in this game, it'll almost feel like you're in this dark and eerie version of modern day Los Angeles. The quests in this game come in a great variety. And sometimes, you might not be able to access these said quests due to your choices! In this game, your choices have an actual affect on what goes on around you. The game also offers a great deal of replayability. The combat isn't that great, in fact, it's a bit broken to be honest, but if you're a fan of role playing games, you should definitely give this game a try.  "

												This game is amazing. For it being a product of the times, it has memorable music and fun gameplay. The glitches can be a mixed bag sometimes and can either be really funny or really annoying, but when they're funny, you might need a minute to recover. Is the plot complicated? A little. Does it make sense? Hell no, but it's vampires in Los Angeles, which isn't supposed to make sense. All in all, give it a playthrough. You won't be disappointed.			"

												This game is very good. It's got excellent writing, a lot of clever mechanics, wonderful overworld, and the diversity of the bloodlines you can choose from encourages multiple playthroughs that you will enjoy.Only problem is that if you don't download the Unofficial Patch you're gonna have a bad time, and you'll have to jump through a few hoops to get the game running. If you go through that ♥♥♥♥, accept the meh combat system, you will have a classic RPG that you will enjoy for dozens of hours.			"

												If you play RPGs not only for incredible loot and skill tree leveling, but also for the sake of role-playing a character and taking in the atmosphere, this is the game for you. While you do gain experience, and unlock new abilities, the skill tree will be unfamiliar to those not already versed in White Wolf's pen and paper games. Also, there is very little gear, whether dropped or bought and it almost feels scripted. You get to a new place, and get a new weapon or armor, at the same time on every character you make. The only other bad point i'll touch on is the combat system. While it's fun hacking away in melee, and the vampire powers you get to back your fighting skills are top-notch visually and mechanically, if you specialize in guns, expect to have a REALLY hard time until about halfway through the game, even if your ranged skill is high. On top of that, even when your wielding a trusty baseball bat knocking some punk to the floor, you literally have to wait for them to get up to strike again as the hit-boxes don't register when they are prone. But those a few minor annoyances, and really aren't the spirit of the game. You can get through many missions without physical confrontation if you are socially inclined, or can make people magically go insane. The characters you meet all have a story and each one's personality might clash with another or even yourself. It's a great opportunity to really role-play a vampire and a must have for anyone looking for more than a run-through guns blazing type of game.			"

												steam says its too long so i cut the boring part, here comes pt 2...Oh God, what am I doing? All the above is the most dull, uninteresting cr@p You ever read. I want to sell this game to You and not in a Wall Street meeting room way, that would not work. So, change of pace OK? Let's see what is sooo coool about VtMB:1. graphics (partly): did You think a decade ago how well the faces and facial expressions of Alyx or Breen were made? Wait for ol' pirate Jack (he is in the tutorial so You do not have to wait much) and You'll change Your tune.2. music, atmospheric sounds and voice acting: they are superb. I only read about the World of Darkness, but they represent well how I just imagined it.3. writing: those Troika guys really know how to sketch up a completely believable character - with only a few lines of dialogue. The story is also great, the quests varied, entertaining and inspired.4. RPG elements: it seems that the developers tried to contain as much as possible of WoD in one game, 7 playable clans is very much respectable, adds immense replay value and a great number of combinations to achieve Your goals. Character development is seemingly simple but understanding it a bit more deeply may lead to some head scratching. Meaning it is good 8).5. quite a selection of vampiric capabilites which complement Your melée wapons or guns. lots of guns.6. nice selection of occult items which enhace Your capabilities.7. Have you ever wanted to......feed on innocents and baddies alike?...steal others' lifeforce from afar?...have a pretty pet ghoul to feel Yourself the center of the universe?...sell a bubblegum and some blood to an idiot who thinks these will help with his vampirism?...lure girls into a dark alley to... to... suck on their neck?...boil Your enemies blood so they explode?...steal drugs from a hospital for the junkie owner of the local pawnshop?...bring peace to a ghost who haunts an old, abandoned and spooky hotel?...damage invaluable paintings?...get a suitcase from under the nose of not one but two gangs for the local arms dealer?...assassinate a russian mob boss boondock saints style?...send a swarm of insects or bats to destroy Your enemies?...lure an annoying tv personality to the hands of a cannibalistic vamp?...do favors for the boss of the most monstrous vamp clan - for posters with some female in-game characters scantily dressed?...destroy a snotty restaurant's reputation?...move faster than Neo?...get love letters from a centuries old vamp 'exotic' dancer?...kill a score of zombies?...use a bush hook to kill the baddies (and goodies)?...destroy the reputation of a celebrity and drive her into suicide?...help out a plaid skirt japanese schoolgirl with destroying a fish smelling demon?...get a pair of human eyes for an evil little old man?...play a character whose talk even You barely understand? (Play Malkavian! 8)...collect the blood of Your victims into a perversed half-alive creation for later use?...have 5+1 different endings?...then this game might be just for YOU!(How was the sales pitch?)Partly due to its troubled history however the game has its problems. The bugs were well wiped out thanks to community effort but still has minor annoyances. Nothing game breaking but like e. g. when You face a boss, there is some talking and after that You have to reselect Your weapon. Things like that, nothing major.Steam has the latest official version, some of the major bugs were addressed in that but You would probably do Yourself a favor installing one of the community patches:True Patch Gold aims to totally conserve the original gameplay while addressing the bugs.Unofficial Patch has two flavors, the basic patch more or less does the same, though some minor changes were made to the original to make some things more logical. In the expanded 'plus' version (it is one download You decide which to use while installing) however the creators tried to restore and even recreate much content cut from the final game, including places, weapons, abilities, weapons, dialogues, quests etc.If You are a purist and want to experience the original game, True Patch Gold is for You.If You do not mind a few changes but want the original experience, UP basic might be the way to go.If You want to see the game as what it could have become if not for its troubled history, choose UP plus.And please, please do not ask in forums which to choose, the above should be enough information. There is a years long flame war involving the patches, their creators and their supporters. Don't spill oil onto the flame. It is a shame, both are great, took up a lot of time and work, both deserve respect. As a closing, a few notes, hints, advices:- save often. Really. There is a quicksave function, You can have a few, it is nat too hard to press F5 (or whatever).- spend some time studying the character sheet and understand how feats work, what adds to them etc. Don't throw around Your points, there won't be that many.- understand how skill books work so You can get the most of them.- specialize. It might be hard, You'll need some unarmed to feed, also there is a quest which is very hard without celerity discipline or ranged - on the other hand the game seems to push You toward melée.- have spare XP points unspent as many as You can. The amount in later game may go up to 50-60. You never know when You'll need to spend a lot to buy in to a skill that You need to complete a quest to Your satisfaction. You WILL need for example high computers and lockpickig, if You spend all Your hard earned XP on fighting/social skill You will be in trouble with side quests, maybe even main ones. Btw, You might think that the game will throw a lot of XP at You later in the game, it won't. Conserve.- if You are completionist, and Your ego can stand it use a walkthrough, otherwise there will be a lot of saving/loading and running around. You don't know beforehand which solution to a quest will yield the best reward. Dialogues are also unfriendly: if You choose the wrong line You might never get to the option that gives the best option. Also NPCs are rarely very clear concerning their wishes. If they hint that it would be appreciated if You did X quest without bloodshed that means that You SHOULD do it that way for the best reward. They are often not even this clear.- if You want to have all endings as an option in the endgame You have to forget about roleplaying and go for shameless bootlicking and say to all major players what they want to hear, all the time.This is it. Well, not much of a review, but at least it is long 8).PS: If You liked Bloodlines You might also want to try Redemption. Even older and uglier and starts a bit slow, quite different from VtMB but has its good points, a very enjoyable experience. VtMB is available on Steam, VtMR on GOG.com. "

												This game has its flaws, mostly technical flaws. In order to make this game function on most computers, you must install a patcher to make the game actually run on your machine. If you make a quick google search, you'll most definitely find the installer. However, underneath all the technical problems, this game is an absolutely great, mostly because of the RPG elements implemented within the game. You start the game by either answering a few questions that affect your character's stats, or you can spec your character yourself. The atmosphere of VTM:B is fantastic. I find the word ""immersive"" pretty tacky, but that's exactly what the atmosphere feels like. Once you've invested a couple of hours in this game, it'll almost feel like you're in this dark and eerie version of modern day Los Angeles. The quests in this game come in a great variety. And sometimes, you might not be able to access these said quests due to your choices! In this game, your choices have an actual affect on what goes on around you. The game also offers a great deal of replayability. The combat isn't that great, in fact, it's a bit broken to be honest, but if you're a fan of role playing games, you should definitely give this game a try.  "

												Currently the main game I am playing at the moment. Personally, I am fascinated by vampire lore in general and Troika Game's adaptation of the pen-&-paper-role-playing-game, Vampire: The Masquerade has so far been really entertaining. I have heard that there are unofficial patches and mods for this game that have been developed by fans since unfortunately Troika Games is defunct (The same folks behind the first Fallout game), but I intend to not use any patches for my first play-through, I might in the future however. Some people would turn away from this game because there are some bugs in this game such as uncooperative doors and quest logs that don't always update. To my understanding this game was a bit rushed and was pushed to be released the very same day as Half Life 2 being the first 3rd party developer to use the source engine. So while you play this game just keep in mind, this is a game from 2004 (10 years ago). I am currently playing a Nosferatuean Vampire whose core mechanic is using stealth (google Nosferatu vampire and you will see why), you can choose quite a few different vampires however, such as Ventrue, a high class vampire who uses charm and persuasion which gives you a more diplomatic sense of playing, or a Malkavian vampire who is bat♥♥♥♥ crazy with hilarious dialogue.This is a good game, but don’t get this game for 20$. You can afford to wait, this game frequently is 75% off on steam sales. It will probably be on sale this Winter Steam Sale.			"

You'll need an external, community patch for the game to run properly (or at all, if you use a 64-bit system with over 3GBs of RAM - otherwise, variables will overflow and it will fail the memory check).

												One of the best games ever made.Good/neutral/evil, stealth, magic (""disiplines""), guns, melee, hand to hand, exploration, different endings and lots and lots of multiple choice, very well-voiced conversations (Fallout 4's female PC for example) make this a true gem of a shooter RPG.The game still holds up today easily. Use the patch (not plus, at least not on first (few) playthroughs) and enjoy 1920x1080, where the only slight minus are the 10 year old graphics (see screens on store page). Choose FPS or third, or alternate instantly as you like. It It has truly incredible replay value, as there are multiple ways of building a character AND seven different ""classes"" (different types of vampire). XP are not given for kills, but for resolving situations (killing everything that moves is one way of resolving pretty much any situation though, but frequently not the only way). Get it! You won't regret it for a second!(BTW I own the original CDs and have finished the game as every character, most more than once, except the Nosferatu. I bought the Steam version recently simply for convienience, so I have many many many more hours in the game than shown here.)			"

												Honestly one of my favorite games of all time. I've had so much fun with this one. Just the Malkavian class by itself is worth a purchase. In terms of Asthetics, Sound Design, Voice Acting, OST, Lore, Dialog Options, Character Customization, Replayability, it's damn near perfect. It's unfortunatly pretty buggy so grab the unofficial patch before playing it to fix it up and add in some more cool extra ♥♥♥♥. Combat is meh but you get used to it pretty quickly so it's honestly not all that bad when compared to how great the rest of the game is. It gets 9.5 hookers sucked dry in a back alley out of 10 from me. For the love of god buy it.			"

												I bought this game just cause it was on sale for $5, didn't think much of it, but when I played it I absolutely fell in love with the game! Not gonna lie, this game is GREAT but it has many flaws. From what I heard the game was rushed, which really shows. Buggy graphics and animations, broken stealth system, broken damage system. Besides that it's still a solid game with rich dialogue and an interesting storyline. The games' lore is very detailed, and there are even books you can buy that tell you about the clans! Even after the game ends there's still so much to learn about the world it takes place in, the playable clans the unplayable clans, and the other supernatural beings. I've played the game 3 times just with the patch, and now I'm currently playing with a mod called 'The Final Nights' which adds all new clans and game mechanics. So after you get bored of the regular game you can download one of the many mods available. I highly recommend this game, even though it's old and rushed it's still an amazing rpg. (This game can be hard at times especially near the end, just a heads up.)			"

												     To call this game a favorite of mine would be no understatement. While, sure - there are areas that it's lacking (both because of it's original release date AND due to it's rushed completion before release) but such things are easily overlooked when it comes to the genuine, lovable storyline, side quests, and characters. This game is witty and just all around really enjoyable, though maybe not for everyone. It's got a humor similar to what you might find in one of the Saints Row games, but I somehow favor this game over the afformentioned. Storylines a bit more involved, too. Though - be warned. After pouring hours upon hours into the patched version of this game, the ending did feel a little bit rushed, but as to be expected with a game that narrowly made it's deadline.     Overall - I consider this a personal classic, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice dark, witty RPG to fill their time. Didn't regret playing.			"

												OK, first off, you will most likely need a patch just to run this game. Unfortunately when this game was originally released it was full of bugs & I guess Steam doesn't provide any fixes but don't worry there is a solution. Go to the forum or the website patches-scrolls and install Wesp5's patch version 8.9. This person has done amazing work to not only get this game running but provided many fixes for any in-game bugs. And it's worth the extra bit of time it takes but first off the bad stuff. The first thing you will notice are the outdated graphics but they really are not that bad and you get used to it pretty quick. The worst thing is combat. It's a bit clunky.....actually, it just plain sucks but not so bad that it's unplayable. The thing is VTMB is billed as an RPG & it not only delivers but it may be the best game ever in this aspect if you like getting immersed in an excellent story. There are rules you have to (un)live by & consequences if you don't. Decisions you make early on reflect what happens later. Basically, in a nutshell, it's an RPG that truly allows you to roleplay who you create & that's what makes this game shine.			"

												While I've not played any game taking place within the Vampire: The Masquerade universe, I was pleasantly surprised by the attention to detail this game in particular had. It was a unique experience, giving me a more contemporary feel of vampires in modern settings, even ones as ugly as the Nosferatu. Hell, even  finding vampires of Asian descent  was an interesting thing to find out. Not to mention how long the game is and how extensive some maps could be, Bloodlines proved to be an adventure worth finishing. That being said, there were some parts of the game that just felt either...off or just broken. While it didn't detract from the overall experience, they were buggersome to have to deal with. Let's break this down into two lists: Pros and cons.Pros:Intriguing story. The ability to mold your path by the choices you make and the factions you choose to aid make the game replayable quite a few times. Multiple paths. As stated above, you can go a completely different route the next time you play just to see how things would've ended.Playstyles. While some types excel in some fields, you're completely capable of being any build you desire, which is a nice bonus to have when figuring out what you wish to be good at. Unfortunately some builds just don't work as the game progresses, which I'll cover below.Theme and enviroments. The world is pretty well done. I didn't expect source to be capable of this kind of detail, major props to the devs. When you walk into the different maps, the different atmosphere feels refreshing too.Characters. I was impressed by the characters and the people voicing them. They were really aggressive and sold their roles enough to make me wish they had more to say. Honestly, I feel this is the biggest selling point of this game.Cons:Combat. Gotta say, the combat in this did not age well. It just didn't feel very engaging to shoot jerkfaces from a distance, nor was it fun to engage in melee combat against things that could very well kill you. The weapons were fun, sure, but it felt somewhat boring.Builds. You can pidgeon-hole yourself if you do not build your character correctly. If you go mostly charisma, you will melt later on. Buffs don't seem to make much of a difference if you don't focus your points into boosting them, which can either interfere and flatout make your build a mess. Imagine having to fisticuff a boss but doing almost no damage. Argh.Story and ending. While interesting, the story felt like it tossed elements at you without really explaining much. Like  the werewolf attack . And while multiple endings exists, only one is worth bothering for, and even that can strain the nerves.Bugs. There are some game-busting bugs that were never fixed in the official release and either need a third-party tool to fix or flatout cheat to get past some triggers that just do not function anymore, which was a big detractor for me.That said, the game is pretty solid and still fun to play, even today. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking to play a game involving vampires and guns. "

												This game is far from perfect, but it is also fantastic. For an old broken game that should NOT have aged well, it has somehow managed to do quite the opposite and be a refreshing and immersive RPG experience. There is a surprising amount of depth and a wide range of options for how to build your character, allowing for new and interesting experiences even through multiple playthoughs. You will meet a variety of characters, most of which are very memorable and leave a lasting impression (even if that impression is that you want to drain them dry on the spot...I'm looking at you, Patty). You will not be impressed by the fighting mechanics, it is janky at best and flatout broken at worst, but you also won't care. The setting, the soundtrack, the NPCs, the simple joy of feeding from unsuspecting humans...it all adds up to something special and fun that you won't regret giving a shot, so just do yourself a favor and buy the hell out of this game.

												This game is one of my all-time favorite RPGs on the face of this earth. I was never into vampire silliness prior to my discovery, but if you're looking for a 3rd person, multi-faceted, gritty / noir-styled action RPG with visceral, albeit clunky, gameplay, then this is it. Mind you, it's a tad dated at this point and certainly has its fair share of flaws, but literally, there's a console-activated cheat that can make the ♥♥♥♥ (breasts) of a certain clan of female vampire expand to be as big as your screen- /no make/. Who cares if they're all glitched and polygonal? What are you, some kinda queer?In short, VtM:B is dated, occasionally glitchy and has a somewhat ponderous fighting mechanic. It also boasts incredible variety, either in how one approaches obstacles (seducing, coercing, persuading, mind-♥♥♥♥ing, murdering, sneaking, exploding, exsanguinating); or what style of character you choose to get it all done with (seven clans of vampire in this iteration of the series and both genders per); or the arsenal of weaponry you can utilize (I'm talkin' katanas, shotguns, flamethrowers, sledgehammers and bush hooks, submachine guns, SEVERED ARMS, et-♥♥♥♥in'-cetera)...PHEW. Anyway, do yourselves a favor and BUY THIS GAME. (NOTE: even the Steam version of this game seems to hate certain versions of Windows? 7 in particular, as I've not been able to play it on my current computer, as noted by my utter absence of play time)			"

												This game pretty much makes up for every one of its shortcomings, and there are plenty, through pure style. There are some fantastic fan mods that even out the rough edges, but even unmodded this is one of the most immersive games out there, one that throws you into its world and lets you explore its darkest reaches. Rather than excessive exposition, it lets you discover the ins and outs of the underground vampire society yourself, much as an outsider like the player character would have to do. It has a fantastic amount of player choice, and a genuinely good storyline to follow, however you choose to play. Many of the core mechanics are pretty sloppy, and the various skills are terribly balanced. Not to mention an excess of bugs can impede your progress. But if you can ignore, or mod out these issues, you'll find it's the perfect vampire game. Just as the Arkham games make you feel like you really are Batman, this makes you really feel like a vampire. And makes vampires cool again in the process.(As usual, ignore my low recorded playtime, as I've already played my non-steam version multiple times.)			"

												Hands down the BEST ROLE playing game made to date (2013). And it was made in 2004. Also the best RPG mechanic I've ever played. Makes the systems used in various MMO's and other rpg seem massively inferior and sometimes pitiful. Highlights are: Every character (except yours) is voice acted, and done by professionals. Your dialogue choices are numerous and varied, and based off how you increase your social skills. Every character is really interesting, and all side quests are excellent. All dialogue is very well written.The main story is really good. And the choice of endings is more ""branched"" then even current rivals, although thats not saying much (Except for Witcher II which holds the crown for choices that  change the entire game and political landscape, and truly stands out in the RPG marketplace). There is plenty of music made by professionals. There are details like news reports and radio shows that progress as you progress thru the game and make mention of things you do. An if you play Malkav you are in for a bonus surprise with regard to that. The whole atmosphere is so darn immersive and well constructed.Multiple clans to play, so the game has at least a couple of repeat play thru's. By my count, minimum of three, since the Nosferatu (stealthy) are quite different, and certainly the Malkavs (totally crazy), and then there is everyone else (they follow more conventional social interaction).Make sure you check out/read up on the community mods for the latest patch (Activision does not bother to fix their own property), and also resolution fixes.

												Resurrected as a vampire after your death, you are recruited to assist in an ongoing war of attrition between several vampire clans who vie for control of Los Angeles. Using a combination of stealth, cunning and brute force, only you can ultimately shape the result of the conflict.Famously released in an unfinished state (though several patches and mods have been released that largely fix this), Bloodlines is a flawed yet absolutely captivating gem of a game that takes the stealth-action RPG hybrid gameplay of series such as Deus Ex and Thief, drapes it in a veneer of equal parts Anne Rice sensual horror and goth club sleaze, and ties it all together with an excellent script dripping with lore, mystery, sexuality, and violence. There's plenty of replay value to be had as well thanks to the diverse array of vampire clans one can play as; from the seductive Toreador or traditionalist Ventrue, to the monstrous Nosferatu or gibbering and insane Malkavian. Just be ready to do some patching after you've installed the game.			"

												This game is something that is very unfortunate. It has a seriously interesting world, that will imerse you regardless of whether you're a fan of gothic culture or not. It spins a vampire tale that is both interesting and enjoyable at the same time. The plot remains solid and tense up until the 75% mark and then it feels unfortunatly rushed. I ended this story, feeling satisified of the journey but the overal end just left me feeling like alot of choices I made didn't matter. This is of course, due to the game developer being rushed to finish the game on time and highlights of game gems such as this one, are unfortunatly not given the extra attention they deserved.Gameplay is very similar to that of games like Deus Ex. You are allowed to tackle objectives in any way you wish, in fact the game presents you with a series of classes which almost define your playstyle from then on. And this isn't just a minor state boost ethier. Playing as a particular class for example, renders you unable to travel on the streets due to your inability to blend in. The consequence of this is that you spend most of the game in sewers eating rats, but have a massive advantage when it comes to any stealth encounter. This is one of the fantastic game design choices the games makes! Certain vampire classes have advanatges in certain areas. Some are good at meddling with humans, others are better at combat and violence. One class is considered insane, and has an entire dialouge choice to back it up in conversations. Combat can be a little worse for ware, but it isn't unplayable. The broken AI, doesn't tend to put up much of a fight - especially in stealth sections. When you pick your class, you will find it difficult to progress down any other path. Stealth classes, tend to be killed quite easily if you try full frontal combat. Stealth isn't just a one off thing ethier, it is supported by stealth kills, shadow blending etc. Overall, when you play this game - it is very difficult not to appreciate it, for what it could be and for what it is. I find it difficult to discredit the game up to the 75% mark. After that, things are obviously rushed, everything becomes more combat focused and you will find yourself struggling if you didn't pick a combat class. Before that though, is a game that definatly rewards player choice in both story and gameplay. It provide an interesting, immersive gothic world that will delight both those who enjoy vampire culture and those who don't, alike.			"

												Despite its quirks (graphical hiccups, repeated NPCs, wonky combat) and the absolute NEED to mod V:tM-B in order to run it on modern systems, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is, hands-down, one of the best RPGs - and possibly the best vampire game - ever made. Simply put, LA does not give two hoots about you, and events are only driven forward when you begin to interfere. Nevermind that vampires have generally fallen out of favor amongst gamers - this is one that should be played through at least once. Lust, hunger, betrayal, and hard decisions - its all here.Expect to die at least a couple of times; the game doesn't pull its punches, and will backhand anyone thinking they're running on rails. The game's world may seem small, but given that the game is over 10 years old now it has quite a bit of space to roam. Maybe not Witcher levels of freedom, but very few of the game's quests are (or really feel like) fetch quests. The things you do change how the game plays, and each Family has their own oddities to them - both good and bad.If there ever was a game that needed a graphical (and gameplay) overhaul, though, it would be this one. The visuals, while striking, are severly dated, and you'll see the same bums/hookers/random people begin to repeat over and over after a while (although it does give the feeling that the city is beginning to mess with your head). As well, the combat system feels severely tacked-on, and while functional, it is almost ALWAYS preferable to go in with a gun rather than a bat or blade, as melee combat suffers the worst. While it only becomes troublesome in a few areas, those can be the places that make one throw the keyboard in disgust. Finally, as mentioned, the game will NOT run unpatched, so picking up an unofficial patch is necessary to run it on a system with a Windows 7 or newer OS (not sure about Vista; it might work, but it definitely doesn't on W7). Attempting to run the game unpatched causes many issues, so don't even think about it.Overall, though, it is worth picking up (especially when it goes on-sale), as it was Troika's last game before they went bankrupt, and while buggy their games have managed to pick up cult classic status over the years. Beyond that, its a damn good convoluted tale featuring the children of the night, and certainly deserves praise for making the player FEEL like they're a bloodsucking monster.			"

												Every time someone mentions it, someone will reinstall it.This is one of the most enjoyable games you'll ever play. Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines is first person and third person action RPG based of the pen and paper RPG of the same title(Vampire the Masquerade). You play as a fledgling vampire who was spared after your sire was executed, now you have to fight the beast inside you by keeping your humanity and obey the laws of the masquerade.Story 10/10This game has amazing writing. From the get go you got yourself into some vampire politics and have a whole new world around you that you have to discover. There's not only kine and kindred (humans and human like vampires) there are also things like the sabbat, werewolves, vampire hunters, etc. The main vampire government are the Camarilla, but their are also vampire rebels known as the Anarchs. As the story progresses you'll have to pick a side. Beyond the main story there are countless side missions that often have mini stories or side stories to them.Gameplay 9/10It's got a lot of buggy issues to the game but there are several 'unofficial' patches to the game that can help. I can't compare the vanilla game with the patched version because I installed the patch before playing it. But mainly there are various mechanics to the game, from simple combat like shooting and melee attacks, disciplines which are basically spells, you have a blood bar you regenerate from drinking blood, you have a humanity bar you need to keep balanced, and finally the masquerade bar. Knowing the names of the mechanics is one thing, figuring and mastering them is another.The game is very immersive, depending on what clan you are and what you do and say to people effects how you are treated by various characters throughout the game. The game allows you to have your own play style, from sneaking around vents to going guns a blazing, and seducing or threatening people you talk to to get information. There are also the little things that make this game so amusing as well, for example I mercilessly murdered a fat guy at a diner and I heard the sounds of sirens and the police were waiting outside, I also broke into an art gallery and a mission later watched a news reporter talk about that very thing. Great stuff!Music 10/10The music is top notch! Composed by Rik Schaffer & various others, the game has many tracks to fit the mood. From ambient tracks for the streets of LA and haunted hotels to Club tracks by actual bands and slow tracks to strip clubs. I absolutely love it!Over all: 9/10VtMB is an amazing game to have. I personally found it hard to stop playing, and within two and a half days already had 25 hours of play time. Even though I make this sound like a masterpiece it does have it's negatives like the need for a patch to properly work, it gets a bit hard/confusing at times to find stuff or complete objectives, or the fact there's not enough Jeanette(play the game and you'll know what I mean ;P)! ::I almost forgot to mention this game has lots of sexual content, it almost surprised me. So if you're not into that kind of thing or just don't like it in general I would highly consider that a factor before thinking about buying this game::  But this is still something to have, especially if you're into vampires or just Action RPG's in general. So I urge you to check it out!			"

												This game is something that is very unfortunate. It has a seriously interesting world, that will imerse you regardless of whether you're a fan of gothic culture or not. It spins a vampire tale that is both interesting and enjoyable at the same time. The plot remains solid and tense up until the 75% mark and then it feels unfortunatly rushed. I ended this story, feeling satisified of the journey but the overal end just left me feeling like alot of choices I made didn't matter. This is of course, due to the game developer being rushed to finish the game on time and highlights of game gems such as this one, are unfortunatly not given the extra attention they deserved.Gameplay is very similar to that of games like Deus Ex. You are allowed to tackle objectives in any way you wish, in fact the game presents you with a series of classes which almost define your playstyle from then on. And this isn't just a minor state boost ethier. Playing as a particular class for example, renders you unable to travel on the streets due to your inability to blend in. The consequence of this is that you spend most of the game in sewers eating rats, but have a massive advantage when it comes to any stealth encounter. This is one of the fantastic game design choices the games makes! Certain vampire classes have advanatges in certain areas. Some are good at meddling with humans, others are better at combat and violence. One class is considered insane, and has an entire dialouge choice to back it up in conversations. Combat can be a little worse for ware, but it isn't unplayable. The broken AI, doesn't tend to put up much of a fight - especially in stealth sections. When you pick your class, you will find it difficult to progress down any other path. Stealth classes, tend to be killed quite easily if you try full frontal combat. Stealth isn't just a one off thing ethier, it is supported by stealth kills, shadow blending etc. Overall, when you play this game - it is very difficult not to appreciate it, for what it could be and for what it is. I find it difficult to discredit the game up to the 75% mark. After that, things are obviously rushed, everything becomes more combat focused and you will find yourself struggling if you didn't pick a combat class. Before that though, is a game that definatly rewards player choice in both story and gameplay. It provide an interesting, immersive gothic world that will delight both those who enjoy vampire culture and those who don't, alike.			"

												Despite some technical flaws, this game is really great! Atmosphere and story are superb, characters are interesting and voice actors really fit their characters. If you enjoy rpgs and/or vampires and (mostly) well written dialog, you will enjoy this. The only flaws in this game are buggy physics and also combat is not really fluent and can sometimes drive you mad.To fully enjoy this game, get rid of some bugs, widescreen support and some extra content, check out the unofficial patches, which can easily be found via google.

												This game is in my top 5 list of all time. I would even give this one the 1st spot. It doesn't matter what kind of genre you're into; if you want to get totaly immersed by a game then get this. The atmosphere in this one is unmatched in my opinion. The soundtrack is one of the best i've ever heard in a game and the characters and the script make the whole thing an unforgettable experience. It can be replayed many times and there are many ways that one can approach things. I actually have this one on disc but i rebought it on steam just to avoid the trouble with the CDs. Another indicator of this game's significance is the fact that, even today, 6+ years after the game's release, it is still receiving unofficial patches. Seriously,in the gaming world there are games and there are experiences. This one belongs to the latter category no doubt about it.			"

												The atmosphere in this game is unmatched. I have vivid memories of walking around in-game Los Angeles, taking in the night-time view and looking up at the sky for longer than I care to admit. Numerous other locations are also worthy of praise, with the Ocean House Hotel deserving special mention for being one of the scariest experiences I've ever had in a video game.The different vampire clans you can play as provide plenty of replayability, and I've played through this game more times than I can count. In particular, Malkavians and Nosferatu make for the most unique experience.The base game is a bit buggy, so track down the latest version of the unofficial patch before you get started. With this installed I haven't had any issues to speak of.Although the graphics are a bit dated now, this game is the most underrated RPG I've ever played. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys RPGs, vampires, or simply a good story.			"

												A staggeringly brilliant game. The story is the darkest and most sophisticated you'll come across in a game, the dialogue is the best I've ever come across in a game, and the Role-Playing elements are brilliantly strong, the amount of options open to you is matched only by Deus Ex. You can clearly see the influence Deus had on Vamp's development, with every mission having several possible methods of completion. While this game is buggy, the fans are still making patches since Trokia sadly went bankrupt after completing this game. You will still experience bugs, and that is the only bad thing about this game, but if you can get past this (and you should) you will find, in my opinion one of the best games ever made. It has a dark sense of humour, and a sophisticated world. Play this game if it's the last thing you do			"

												One of the hardest parts of writing any good review comes from writing the review itself. Every person has their own appeal, games they like and dislike, and reasons for those likes and dislikes. Not every game a reviewer will play will conform to those likes or dislikes, and a review must still compose himself and present a fair and balanced review in spite of his personal thoughts. I bring this up because it is very difficult to talk about Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines (hereafter referred to simply as ‘Vampire') without delving into the subjective elements it presents without sucking all the emotion and personality from the review and transforming it into a technical overview of the game itself. As such, I have divided this game up into two sections, an objective and a subjective one. But first an overview of the game itself;In Vampire you play as a young person living in L.A. who has recently been transformed into one of the undead. Upon your indoctrination you quickly come to discover that the vampire society needs to be very secretive about how they act so as to keep the public unaware of their actions. Before long, though a sarcophagus which may or may not house the remains of a very ancient and very powerful vampire is uncovered and the various vampire clans in the city all begin a secret war of cloak and dagger tactics, each trying to recover the sarcophagus and its contents or deny them to others for themselves, all while trying to keep their very existence secretive from humans.Firstly, for the objective. The game is VERY well designed and it shows in its game mechanics. Serving as a action RPG with elements of The Elder Scrolls (except less open, confining the player to four primary districts that are fairly small and multiple dungeons) it is solid right from the get-go. From the beginning you are forced to select one of a series of vampire clans, each offering its own unique set of bonuses, abilities, and disadvantages that will end up shaping how you play. I, personally, ended up going with Clan Ventrue which focuses a lot on persuasion, but can't feed off of animals and can only feed reliably on upper-class humans. Someone else may end up with Nosferatu which can't raise their appearance at all and has to avoid being seen at all by humans for example.The gameplay itself is fairly solid with most of the controls being very tight and having almost no real problems beyond a few glitches (which I will cover later) which I can't blame on the controls. One of the interesting things is that, instead of leveling up stats like strength and such, the player instead levels up various skills and abilities which, in turn, affect stats. This can cause for some very interesting outcomes where a character may choose to level up a skill they don't intend to use at all to bolster another skill which they do, in fact, use and results both in a large amount of flexibility and interesting builds as well as a drive to experiment around and see what else can be done.Another interesting thing is that players do not gain experience from killing enemies in the slightest, but rather from quest completion. This puts an added drive to complete even simple sidequests as the added experience is the only way to make your character stronger.Lastly, there are two special meters that will need proper attention. The Humanity meter and the Masquerade meter. A large focus of the game is the focus on struggling against the vampire urges and keeping ones self ‘human' despite needing to drink human blood in order to survive. Certain actions can cause players to lose some of their humanity and, as the gauge lowers to 0, it can result in them becoming utterly feral. Meanwhile, keeping the humanity high can result in a weaker vampire who struggles with their new nature. Additionally, keeping ones actions as a vampire secretive is very key and, every time a player is caught being a vampire in public, it costs them on the Masquerade meter. They start with a set amount of chances and, if those chances ever all disappear, game over (going feral wastes a chance). This puts an added focus on keeping ones nature as a vampire truly secret and staying human as going feral at the wrong time on a player who didn't try to keep hidden can cause an outright loss.Visually the game is fairly solid as well. While, sadly, you won't be able to delve too deep into the many complexities of polygon count, it very successfully manages to convey the feeling of the World of Darkness (the world as a vampire sees it). Vampire does its best to drive this home too, but manages to back it up with some solid displays. While they may look a bit dated today, there is a HUGE difference between ‘dated' and ‘bad' and this is most certainly not the latter.There are some problems with the game though. First off it seems to revel in giving vague directions and not giving you anything resembling a quest-marker. While this wouldn't normally be too bad of a thing it is very easy to end up lost and unsure of where to go or who to talk too, especially if you stop playing the game for a week or more and don't remember the location of an important NPC with the lack of a map (aside from some bus-stop signs) driving the annoyance home. But, more overbearingly, is the glitches. There are a LOT in this game, and they are NOT of the minor kind. These are the kind that can destroy a game and leave it unplayable. Hunting down a patch and/or activating the command console may very well be a requirement for this game.And now for the subjective. This is a dark game. A VERY dark game to say the least. The game makes sure to reinforce this with such locations like abandoned hospitals, scummy apartment buildings, sleazy motels, brothels and night clubs galore, and death around every corner. The streets are almost never clean and are littered with trash, bums and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s seem to be the most common ‘professions', and so forth. People looking for a game about sparkling vampires, or even just ‘normal' vampires may find themselves off-put easily. This is a very dark and pessimistic game, and it ended up causing me to rethink about how to score this.To say that this is a bad game simply because it's world is so scummy and grim is shortselling what the game does right. In any other setting where you can count the number of people who are ‘good' on more than one hand this probably would have been an amazing title. However, this game does not hide for even a moment that this is a grim and depressing world. People not looking for this sort of thing specifically can very easily end up becoming disguised and/or offended by it. Even the ending of the game seems to love rubbing in just how dark this world is.As a result, I feel it is VERY important to look into the game before buying it and deciding if you wish to play a game like this. While it can be enthralling for people who revel in its darkness, for those people looking for even the tiniest ray of light and hope, they would be better off searching elsewhere.In summery: while a solid game that is mired by some technical problems, its subjective aspects and story may simply be so off-putting to a player who does not enjoy its dark and grim world as to not make this game recommendable on a whim. If you buy this game, you should know what you're getting into, because this game is in no way shy about tossing you into the shadows.My pricing: For someone looking for a dark game: 15-20 bucks. It's very solid, if a bit dated and dealing with bugs.For someone not: Avoid at all costs. Remember, this is a game where it is possible to lose because you couldn't pretend to be a human being instead of a blood-sucking monster well enough.			"

The game also has loads of dialogue options that effect how people interact with you and what quests are available.

												Seriously a gaming milestone, one of the best games I have ever played. Well made and full of character and intrigue it also features the most frightening sequence I have ever experienced in movie or game format to a point where many people opt to skip the section via the console due to its nature (one could argue if you have played through it once you find it more annoying than scary). It has a lot of great writing and acting in it and the downsides to the game are that it was released before Half-Life 2 and as such valve didn't let them use the fully optimized version of the source engine which led to a lot of bugs. Bloodlines was hurried near the end of production as Troika was going out of business and the combat slog toward the end of the game reflects that. Several people continued to work on the game without pay just to get it as finished as it could be. A fan patch might be necessary for you to fully enjoy this free of some odd bugs but you do yourself a disservice missing out.			"

												One of the best game i have ever played. Bloodlines features every night creature we know and love into one good RPG. Story is really cool and makes you want to move forward. You were bitten and turned, now you discover the underground world of vampires and need to learn how to be one of them. The game have a lot of interesting NPCs and characters for you to interact or feed if you so wish. Has a compelling vampire lore built that does not sound stupid or untrue. Combat is real time but based on stats (weapon damage + your skills). You have some vampire powers also to use. Boss fights can be a drag, but are not really that bad. You also have a lot of choices and paths to take. You can almost always choose to go peacefull, stealth or all out warfare (depends on skills). Some missions are scary (especially the mansion one, you will know what i am talking about after you played it) and can range from the basic deliver this in there to complex and engaging storylines.From the start you can choose your race and some features. Add some points in skills you desire. You will also visit different cities and locations.Warning: The game have a memory problem, meaning if you have more then 2gb memory ram, you will need to download the unofficial patch, which fixes the problem and many others, so i would recommend it even if you can run it vanilla.The game is fun and fresh, i would recommend it for anyone that likes RPGs and long conversations and choices ala Mass Effect.

The variations you can have between clans (classes) range from the literal insanity of the Malkavians to puking your guts up if you feed on bums as a Ventru.That being said, this game is a little broken. I've been stuck in doors, air vents, and sewers more than I'd like to admit. Also, stealth is a joke. Each stat can go up to a value of 10. With a value of 3, I was able to bump into guards without being detected. All in all, worth buying. Maybe not for full price... but still worth buying.			"

I read that a few years ago, mind you, and I have since found other RPGs to add to my ""best RPGs of all time"" list. But Bloodlines, despite its age, its sort of mediocre gameplay that can confuse you for being based on a set of rules that are not always apparent, despite its dated visual and lack of character customization... Despite all that, the world, characters and tone still keep me coming back. Pretty much every quest is interesting, the dialogs are well writen, the urban fantasy setting is something I wish I could see more often in gaming (especially in RPGs) and it has what simply must be my favourite haunted house level in gaming. Ever.So yes, after almost ten years I still recommend Vampire, if nothing else because it will show you a world like which you won't find in any other videogame.Man, now I feel like starting another playthrough.

												Vampire: The Masquerade is a decently well-known role-playing system that I was not familiar with before playing Bloodlines. However, for a new player like myself to jump in without any prior context, Bloodlines does a great job of establishing the fiction of the world of Vampire. What is most impressive is the game's way of forcing a ""vampire mentality"" on you. The Masquerade is a system requiring vampires to keep their existence secret from humanity, and this sometimes means having to kill innocents in unfortunate circumstances. By not doing so, you risk the lives and foundation of all vampire society. Bloodlines is an open-world modern RPG/adventure, allowing you to take quests while following a main story narrative. For a game released in 2004, the graphics aren't half-bad, and the character expressions/facial animations are actually rather impressive. Be aware that some odd unofficial patching needs to be done to make this game work on modern systems.4 out of 5 foxes.			"

												Bloodlines takes some getting used to the first time around, but once you have the gameplay down, it's not hard AND it's wicked fun! +'s *Story! The story is a lot of fun, and based on what you do, you can have different endings.*Class variety! There are 7 clans which is the perfect number of classes for a game. Each vampire clan is treated different by NPCs and has a different set of abilites (although some abilites are shared between classes.)* Immersive! You really feel like you're in the World of Darkness.*CHARACERS, CHARACTERS, CHARACTERS!*REPLAY VALUE! Because your character gets treated different, you get new lines of dialogue each time and have to try new strategies for the same quests.-'s*Slight glitches can get annoying, but they happened very infrequently and had mostly to do with getting stuck on doors in my case.*That's pretty much it. This game is GREAT!			"

One moment you'll be investigating a haunted hotel, the next you'll be raiding a warehouse full of gangbangers, then you'll get your share of zombie survival,only to find yourself within reach of a cuddly werewolf named Fido who loves to eat young boys like you.Gameplay is similar to deus ex.Has the most horrendous sewer level in existance.9.5/10			"

												Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines is a heavily story driven Action-RPG where there's several town hubs with whacky characters who want YOU to do their bidding. Everyone has their own ulterior motive and the deep lore that goes into the ""World of Darkness"" that this game is based on just enhances the feel and depth of this story.The combat mechanics are pretty simple, there's 2 types of weapons, melee and ranged. If you want to be a crazy monster vampire who uses his fists to beat people into dust.. You can do that. If you want to use ranged weapons by running around and shooting people up.. You can do that.  If you want to go around with a katana and slash people up.. You can do that as well. The skill and ""clan"" system helps you build your character the way you want to. There's many different clans, all of them have different skill sets, pros and cons - There's the nosferatu that need to go through sewers because of their hideous deformed bodies would alert humans of the supernatural. There's the Malkavian who keeps on hearing different voices in their heads (Although most of it seems gibberish, a lot of it is actually true and the voice can also tell you the future or hidden intends behind the people.), malkavians have completely different dialogue options and their lines can also be seen as insane and convoluted with hidden intents. The lore is just so deep in this that you can't help but get invested.This games second strong point is choice. You will have different choices on how to complete your quests, you will have choices on what you would like to do with the item, would you be OK with giving the item to the person who wants it, or can you find a third party who will offer more for it? Do you care for your own humanity and help people out just to keep your connection to the mortal life that you had. Or will you only look out for yourself, discarding the other peoples needs just to further your own agenda. There are multiple choices for everything you do, but what's great is that there's choices that aren't apparent and if you manage to find them they will usually pay off sweetly. This is a masterpiece in gamedesign. You WILL find interesting quests and items if you look around enough and you are not rewarded for going around and killing everything, but are rather ENCOURAGED to do things the way you want to.Even though this game was released in an extremely buggy state because the game developer didn't have enough money to keep working on this. The game has been fixed with several patches (Some of the game devs worked for free after getting laid off, just to fix this. Goes to show how much they actually loved this game.).. Now thanks to the huge community there's several mods, unofficial expansions, etc that completely change up this game.Before buying this game on steam I had already spent more then 100 hours in this, so I've played this for around 200 hours or so..

												While it is true that the game is kind of buggy, and at this point outdated to be sure; it is still in my opinion the best Vampire game available on the market. If you know of, read or played Vampire: The Masquerade the pen and paper game you definitely have to play this video game. It stays pretty true to the pen and paper version and provides a decent story with some replayability. But none of that really matters, because the key to the pen and paper game as well as this game is to provide a realistic experience of being a Vampire, which this game does. Also you can use a Katana and hack people up, which is just awesome.			"

												Resurrected as a vampire after your death, you are recruited to assist in an ongoing war of attrition between several vampire clans who vie for control of Los Angeles. Using a combination of stealth, cunning and brute force, only you can ultimately shape the result of the conflict.Famously released in an unfinished state (though several patches and mods have been released that largely fix this), Bloodlines is a flawed yet absolutely captivating gem of a game that takes the stealth-action RPG hybrid gameplay of series such as Deus Ex and Thief, drapes it in a veneer of equal parts Anne Rice sensual horror and goth club sleaze, and ties it all together with an excellent script dripping with lore, mystery, sexuality, and violence. There's plenty of replay value to be had as well thanks to the diverse array of vampire clans one can play as; from the seductive Toreador or traditionalist Ventrue, to the monstrous Nosferatu or gibbering and insane Malkavian. Just be ready to do some patching after you've installed the game.			"

The action bits are a bit (ok, very) railsy, but the writing is top notch, helped by solid voice acting, and the story is well paced, with plenty of room for player choice. In fact, people talk about ""mortality system"" and whatever, but honestly Bloodlines does moral choices better than all the games that attempt it today, and all without a crammed on sidegame.			"

												This is a great game with amazing role playing opportunities but unless you're willing to use unofficial patches and the console to get past issues, choose a different game. On a modern system, this game won't run without an unofficial patch and even then you run into hiccups. Still interested? Well, sit down because I'm going to tell you why this game is the vampire RPG you've been looking for and more.Ever craved more after Skyrim's tiny vampire section? Well, here it is, with fangs and bloodlust to match.This game puts you in the middle of an urban city environment based in 2004. You've been sired by a vampire against the Masquerade and if not for Kindred (vampires) political machinations, you'd be ash alongside your sire.Now, you are thrust into a world of politics, monsters and blood, all whilst hiding your true nature. The clan you pick has a decent factor in on this and some more than others. There are different ways to handle situations throughout most of the game and it's really just near the end where the rewarded path becomes the least successful which is quite discordant.Each situation is very different, leaving very little of that normal copy and paste side quest/main quest situation, giving you a fulfilling storyline to warm your undead heart. Mechanics have you thinking like a vampire- a game where you are the predator and sometimes, the prey don't know how close they were to their death, spared because it was too much effort. Your judgement, skills and so on will determine how you approach things.The penalties for violating the Masquerade by exposing vampiric activities to the Kine (humans) can be severe if you're not careful. Feed on anyone out in the open, use certain powers openly, amusement, even the wrong speech choice can get you in trouble. Five strikes and it's an automatic final death/game over. Humanity Loss, unfortunately with the XP you can spend to undo is a little less dire but be careless and not fix a severe deficit and suddenly you're looking at a frenzy where you literally lose control for a bit. Injury and thirst for blood can bring out the vampiric beast within. Mostly, a savvy player will sidestep these pitfalls but occasionally, you’ll find yourself desperate for blood and a crowd of unwitting humans after a hellish quest so stock up on those spare blood bags.Gameplay can get frustrating and there's no difficulty bar. My best advice to new players is don't get intimidated, and you'll make it through, even if you need to add self-advantage.I won't spoil the main game but the World of Darkness universe is an amazing playground for your vampire RPG-ing wants. You have to play it for yourself and carve out your potential eternal life, although be careful. The wrong side at the end can leave your legacy as a fate worse than death. It’s a game of consequences with logic behind decisions and outcomes based on your choices. Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines is a great vampire RPG, arguably one of the only chances you'll have to play a vampire as they were made to be and it leaves you wondering why more entries couldn't have been made. It is 'the' vampire RPG everyone wishing to sink their fangs into the night must have and the price is worth the gamble to get it running on newer computers.My final score for this game is 9.5/10 and the half point loss is for the bug that required no-clip and the fifteen reloads it took to get through to the next section for an otherwise game breaking bug. Any older game made for XP and earlier you pick up at this point will come with all kinds of issues but this game was released as an unstable beta, requiring years of caring work by Wesp5, who deserves an eternity of gratitude for getting this game to run as well as it does.

												I'll give you the TL;DR right away to save you some time: BUY THIS GAME. NOW. (or wait until it's $5, either way, it's worth it)Cons:Buggy. Download the unofficial patch (link in Steam forums), it fixes most of the bugs. I recommend the basic patch on your first playthrough. There's still some bugs after the patch, but just make sure you save a lot. Fixing most bugs is as simple as restarting the game and reloading your save. I only had to do this maybe two-three times with the patch. It's probably more without it. I encountered no game-breaking bugs. I do hear of some people having a hard time getting it running as well. I've never had issues, but the solutions are out there, and the effort is worth it.Clunky Combat. This game tricks you into thinking it's going to be more like an FPS, at first. Disregard. It's fairly straightforward RPG combat via mashing the left-click (with a little more to it as you'll learn). Guns are very weird at first, and melee is a bit hard to grasp right away. I actually quit and uninstalled the game on my first character because of this. I'm very glad I gave it a second chance. Once you get used to it, it's not bad at all. You'll be a ninja in no time, I promise.Character models. This is more of a personal preference, but I think the chracters have a bit too much charicature. They're a bit cartoony as you can see by the screenshots. In spite of that, the game is actually pretty dark, gritty, and sometimes, downright scary. I often forgot all about them while playing.Animations. The animations, especially during cutscenes, are a bit funky. It's bearable, though. And that's just the body animations. The facial animations are pretty good. Great for 2004. The cloth physics are a bit wack.Map size. A pro and a con at the same time, almost. The map is split into fairly small loading zones focused around city hubs and various quest locations. If you're used to more open worlds, it might take a bit to get used to. It doesn't bother me, personally. They do a decent job at filling them with content, even if the content does get a bit thinner in the later maps (a lot of games do this).Pros:Atmosphere. The biggest seller for me in this game. Bloodlines nails it's gothic atmoshere so well, it's almost uncanny. It's horror elements are also very well executed. Not too many games can get my heart racing like this one has. One part in particular, if you don't know what you're doing, is nightmare inducing (Hint: The last screenshot might have something to do with the part I'm referring to).Story. The story is gripping and packed with intrigue. Some of the gameplay elements might get a bit repetitive (as with just about any game), but I was always driven to continue just to see events unfold. Lots of twists and turns. Everything you would want from a VtM story. Some things were a bit obvious, but everything works. There's also multiple endings depending on where you choose to put your loyalty. They ultimately lead to the same place and overall outcome, but this didn't bother me. I found that siding with myself got some of the most epic dialogue and immersion. Every step of the way, you really feel like you're being dragged deeper down into a dark underworld. And don't worry if you're not familiar with the PnP, this game does a great job introducing fledglings to the VtM universe.Characters. Memorable and well voice-acted. They drive the story along flawlessly. Not much else to say about that.Choice. Wanna skulk in the shadows, Gordon Freeman through ventilation systems, picking locks and hack computers to get through? Or do you wanna kick the door in and beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of everything with your fists? You got it. Unfortunately, the amount of choice peters off around the halfway mark. Due to Troika having their budget and their deadlines cut by Activision, much of the latter half of the game is very combat heavy. The story and characters don't falter, though. I found stealth and social-focused characters fairly difficult to play later on. In some cases, I even cheated and/or just stopped advancing with those characters. It's a bit disheartening, but it is what it is. You can still enjoy the first half thoroughly, with social or stealth. Just make your first character combat-focused to get the whole story without much of a hitch, then play around with the other stuff in subsequent playthroughs.Music. The music selection is small, but well-produced. They are also in non-propietary formats in the game files, so if you really enjoy them, you can copy them to your preferred device.Replayability. Although the game isn't terribly long, there's plenty of oppurtunity for replay. Playing different clans alters your experience, sometimes dramatically. I recommend a Brujah specializing in Celerity for an easy-mode play through. The Matrix-esque effects of a high Celerity level is pretty neat. The wacky Malkavian makes a great second character (might be hard to follow along with the dialogue for a first-timer). Nosferatu is expert mode. Along with that, the modding community is still undead and well. You can find everything from the basic bug-fixing patches like suggested above, all the way to major game alterations. I state again, I recommend only the basic unofficial patch for a fledgling to minimize bugs/incompatibility frustration.Conclusion:Although both lists have a similar number of entries, I assure you, the Pros FAR outweigh the cons. This is the perfect game to play during the Halloween season (in which it usually goes on sale as well). I can play it any time of day, myself. With CCP plopping their fat asses on the IP with no apparent interest in using it, this is the best VtM game you're going to get for a long time. In extension, I would argue that it's the best vampire game ever made, and sadly, will probably remain so.			"

												Vampire: The Masquerade is a tabletop RPG game that was brought into the video gaming world with its first endeavor, ""Redemption"". After that, the creative and much more free roaming sequel, ""Bloodlines"" came out and basically shut down Troika games because of its bugs and glitches. However, the game itself, with its plot, choices, characters and overall lay out were good enough that fans have been releasing unofficial patches for the game in the decade since it was released. What does THAT tell you about the game? ;)    In Bloodlines, unlike Redemption, you get to choose your character by picking which gender you are and which vampire class. The vampire classes are an interesting assortment and essentially choose what your main skills and penalties turn out to be. If you're a Nosferatu, you're hideous and can roam about in public, but you're very intelligent and technical, if you're a Toreador, you're gorgeous and persuade/seduce almost anyone in the game, but you aren't very strong or intelligent and so on. Once you pick your class, you are thrust into a world of vampiric politics, gothic nightclubs and other fun stuff.    The fight mechanics are decent enough and the overall choices that you get make the game extremely enjoyable. The game has multiple endings and you essentially choose what kind of vampire you want to be (nice to people, recklessly homicidal to people, break all the rules, etc.) and what kind of vampire politics you want L.A. to turn into (ruled by the manipulative Vampire prince, ruled by the manipulative asian sorceress, ruled by you, or kill everyone and embrace vampiric anarchy). While the glitches are noticeable, even with any of the numerous fanmade uber-patches, the game is worth playing.			"

												Vampire Bloodlines is an awesome game! Hardly anyone has heard of it because it came out the same day as Half Life 2 (so it's pretty obvious why it hasn't had much limelight) You start out by either choosing your own clan and gender, or answering a few questions and letting the game assign you a clan. After assigning stats and giving yourself a name, the game opens with a cinematic of you doing the dirty with some ♥♥♥♥♥ (or man♥♥♥♥♥) and suddenly some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s break in and stake her (or him) and you! It then cuts to you both knelt infront of a large audience of various vampire clans and groups (apparently in this, staking only paralyzes) and then your lover (♥♥♥♥♥) gets put to death for changing you into a vampire without permission, but you get set free as it wasn't your fault! Then the fun begins in a dark grissley world full of sex, violence and a wide variety of enemies. Although this IS an RPG, don't go into it expecting a world the size of Skyrim! Just expect a good game.			"

												     To call this game a favorite of mine would be no understatement. While, sure - there are areas that it's lacking (both because of it's original release date AND due to it's rushed completion before release) but such things are easily overlooked when it comes to the genuine, lovable storyline, side quests, and characters. This game is witty and just all around really enjoyable, though maybe not for everyone. It's got a humor similar to what you might find in one of the Saints Row games, but I somehow favor this game over the afformentioned. Storylines a bit more involved, too. Though - be warned. After pouring hours upon hours into the patched version of this game, the ending did feel a little bit rushed, but as to be expected with a game that narrowly made it's deadline.     Overall - I consider this a personal classic, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice dark, witty RPG to fill their time. Didn't regret playing.			"

												This is one of those underated games. Even if you don't like fantasy stuff or vampires, this is one game you're going to love especially if you're into First Person Shooters with RPG featutes. Anyone who is into games like Fallout or Skyrim will like this unknown gem. You play as a vampire who was recently turned and a result must learn the ways of the vampire. This isn't your regular vampire game. You must blend in as a human and learn skills that benefit you throughout the game. You gotta learn to hack computers and break into locks along with supernatural abilities like blowing up people by boiling up their blood. Not only is the gameplay fun as hell, but the storyline is actually pretty interesting. Learn about different sects of vampires and choose who to side with. Be wise, as some choices are harder to keep than others.			"

												This is one of the greatest games of all time.  It also is a twitchy pile of bugs by default, so it's a misunderstood cult classic that's basically unplayable by default.  Don't let that scare you, Bloodlines spins an amazing world with great characters, disturbing ideas, and an amazing amount of choice that is rarely seen in games (it puts Mass Effect to shame, at least). The combat is decent, but it's definitely not the important part of this game and can make you game a bit annoying if you built a poorly-planned character.Don't let the negatives dissuade you though, this game has hundreds of hours of gameplay if you look for it and tremendous replayability.

												This game is a Historical piece for many reasons, the first of which being thta Bloodlines it's one of the best RPG ever made. Bloodlines launched in 2004 and was the debut of the famous Source Engine, Valve's technology that would later on support nothing less than Half-Life 2. If that isn't enough, the game was the downfall of Troika, a games studio formed by key people from Black Isle, responsible for the first two Fallout games. The game is deeply hardcore, and completely written for fans of the Vampire: The Masquerade pen & paper RPG. It's a RPG true to the roots, where you spend most of your time exploring, talking and interacting with a world pretty much alive. It not only explores all that it can from the V:tM setting, but borrows everyhting that fits from the World Of Darkness full setting, meaning one can expect to see nothing short of changelings, werewolfs, Kindred Of The East, Mages and who knows what else. The game is full of memorable characters, with decent voice acting and nice models. The quests are very interesting, and tie well with the setting. Surely, this is one of the most ambituous RPG projects ever done, and it's not a surprise that Troika couldn't quite finish it.A rushed production meant that most of the game wasn't ready by the time it was unleashed upon the world. This resulted in poor reception by the specialized media and worse by players, who where annoyed by semi done quests, lots of bugs and a number of other problems. And since Troika closed doors a few months later, people thought there was no hope.Nonetheless, a few people could see the jewel inside the oyster and started working on ""unnoficial"" patches that not only fixed the glitches but also unlocked lots of unfinished content and enabled players to enjoy the whole detailed scenario. To accompany that, ENB has a cool DX patch that improves the graphics and make the game even more obscure and dark that it already is. If you ever played Vampire: The Masquerade with friend, you owe it to yourself to play the game. If you enjoy true RPGs, you won't forgive yourself for not trying this game. The good is so good that you'll be able to forgive the bad.			"

												One of the best games ever made.Good/neutral/evil, stealth, magic (""disiplines""), guns, melee, hand to hand, exploration, different endings and lots and lots of multiple choice, very well-voiced conversations (Fallout 4's female PC for example) make this a true gem of a shooter RPG.The game still holds up today easily. Use the patch (not plus, at least not on first (few) playthroughs) and enjoy 1920x1080, where the only slight minus are the 10 year old graphics (see screens on store page). Choose FPS or third, or alternate instantly as you like. It It has truly incredible replay value, as there are multiple ways of building a character AND seven different ""classes"" (different types of vampire). XP are not given for kills, but for resolving situations (killing everything that moves is one way of resolving pretty much any situation though, but frequently not the only way). Get it! You won't regret it for a second!(BTW I own the original CDs and have finished the game as every character, most more than once, except the Nosferatu. I bought the Steam version recently simply for convienience, so I have many many many more hours in the game than shown here.)			"

But is it worth it. White Wolf has always been one of my favorites when it comes to table top games, and when they made the first Vampire video game ( Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption released in 2000 for PC ) I played it for ages. Also played the 2 games they released for the xbox for Hunter : The Reckoning. What im trying to say here is I'm a big White Wolf fan so my opinion my be slightly biased. Ether away, the game is great in my opinion. Great story telling, awesome dark atmosphere, and great RPG elements. The combat system is a little clunky but they maybe just due to the fact that in game im still a flegling (new vampire) and still working on my skills. In the end if you are a vampire fan at all, or just a fan of dark evil worlds this game is well worth the money.			"

Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines.Long name, incredible game. Quite possibly the best game I have ever played. I have reached the final boss several times, but only finally got around to giving him his Final Death today. Taking around thirty hours, this is a game complete with an amazing story, interesting characters, cool powers, and the most legit vampire's I know of. The basic story begins with your 'embrace' - where you become a vampire - and continues as your rise in power and prestige, until you are causing the events, rather than reacting to them.Each of the nine clans you can choose from have different abilities. They could be considered classes, similar to other games, but they aren't usually wildly different. Most of the change is in the player models, and the powers - each clan getting two powers from a pool, and a third unique to their clan. But there are enough differences to make replaying a possibility. For example, the Nosferatu are hideous, and as such cannot seduce people for blood, and instead have to suck on rats in the sewers below the streets, while the Ventrue clan is the opposite - they cannot drink from rats due to their nobility. Another is clan Malkavian; each and every one of them is insane. Incredibly, they have 100% unique dialogue, opposed to other clans having a few lines or opportunities each, and can engage in some interesting tangents - such as having a conversation with the news reporter on TV.While the vanilla version is very buggy - due to the developers being rushed in their final stages - most of these issues can be resolves with the fan made Unofficial Patch, which is a must-get if you plan on playing. It's not the prettiest game either, with some pretty terrible animations at times, but all this is forgiveable in the face of such a wonderful experience. The game uses Valve's source engine (an earlier version of the engine Titanfall is built on), and was released on the same day as Half-Life 2; and though the models in the game are by no means of equal quality, they are attractive in their own way, and help nail the bleak, horror/noir atmosphere.If Firefly was a game, it would be this one. While the themes are not at all similar, it is the kind of game that when someone brings it up in conversation, or you read about it on the net, you pretty much have no choice but to reinstall and have another crack at it.10/10. I honestly cannot think of any way to improve it, other than give the devs more time to improve a couple of the cutscenes.tl;dr - V:TM-B is one of the best games ever. It is often on sale on Steam. buy it. Install the most recent Unofficial Patch. Enjoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of it.P.S. ♥♥♥♥ the haunted hotel. The game isn't all that scary, the hotel always gets me.			"

												Oh boy, where to begin?Vampires : The Masquarade : Bloodlines is one of those games that become classics the moment you turn them on. The closest thing I could relate it to, both in terms of gameplay and overall feeling is the first Deus Ex, as in both games you are some kind of superhuman who gets to master disciplines and powers in an RPG fashion in a game that gives you complete freedom in how to tackle the problems it throws at you (The third Deus Ex could qualify as well, but it tends to make the various intended paths obvious to you right off the bat, rather than letting you think of creative approaches yourself), and each clan (read : Character class) helps complement those playstyles.I'm not really going to say much more, because at this point, you should know whether the game interests you or not, but know this :- Steam only provides the retail version of the game, which is notoriously buggy (not just minor stuff, I'm talking about the game being outright unbeatable or just crashing all the time) because Activision insisted that the game be released the same day as Half Life 2. This version only includes the most critical fixes, like getting the game to start on computers with more than 1GB of video RAM. You definitely should download the unofficial patch (which actually includes ""official"" fixes) at this adress : http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647- As enjoyable as I found the experience, the game really begins to lose itself in the last few missions, where levels become longer, much more linear, and where non-combat builds start becoming a lot less viable. The last bosses (which one you get depends on your choices) are especially bad about this, as you probably won't leave a scratch on them unless your combat skills are at least level 8 or 9, but they go down in seconds once they are. Just keep that in mind if you're planning to go down a more non-combat route.- If you go for stealth, prepare for some set pieces to look weird., like enemies busting in through a window or blowing up a wall and then stand there doing nothing.This said, if you're a fan of RPGs, and especially if you liked the first Deus Ex, you owe yourself to play that game.

Also grab some mods for the game, it really opens it up. Finally, even when you beat it, I strongly suggest playing again as a Malkavian. It's a totally different experience.			"

												This game sucks.So much blood! Punny.This game stands the test of time. Sure the graphics are a bit outdated and the melee combat is clunky...but it oozes atmosphere, it provides a variety of ways to handle challenges from stealth/diplomatic/KETM (Kill Everything That Moves). The soundtrack is amazingly solid and even though you play a creature of the night, one of the horror genre's most fearsome killers...you aren't the top dog.In fact the game does an amazing job of juggling your 90's action flick itch as much as it does your Amityville Horror don't play with the lights off itch. It promotes multiple playthroughs and the great thing is that the playthroughs actually change in notciable enough ways! Want to play as an angsty Lost Boys inspired punch and cry Brujah? How about the ""Interview with a Vampire"" -esque prissy Toreador. Go for it...how about after you play as the monsterously disgusting Nosferatu. Or you could be a bat brained crazy Malkavian and spread the sympony of voices you hear in your haad to everyone you meet...Not only do the play differently, some more than others, they can also change how you and the world around you interact with one another.Another thing to remember, though abandoned by dev and publishers it has been supported heavily by the community. With a host of user friendly mods that not just add to the game but also fill in some of the things the devs didn't get to.Most importantly...you haven't lived until you've had a conversation with a stop sign.

												Nice RPG. Set in a very gothic/punk atmoshpere, so if you're not into that, you may get bored. But the progression and multiple ways one can do things are always cool additions.  Please note that, while this game is listed as a first person RPG (which it is for the most part), it is NOT first person for melee combat. It is first person for shooting, conversation, exploration, but not melee combat. This does not take away from the experience in my opinion, though.			"

												This is probably best World of Darkness game I've ever played and I fully reccomend it but only if you are willing to cope with many problems. Despite many official and unofficial patches and bugfixes, experience with Bloodlines may still be painfull. It is still great RPG expierience but it really falls down on it's face once you reach about 2/3'ds into the game. At that point whole roleplaying goes out of the window in favor for gunfights, drawn-out mazes and almost all characters (including your own) becoming brutes and thugs.

Being almost 10 years old (I think), this game really shows its age with outdated graphics, and very buggy gameplay but with a installation of the Unnoficial patcher and some High res mods this game is very enjoyable. You choose one of six Vampire types and then are plunged into the nightlife of a Vampire, however this does not mean that you can go around draining each human like a certain celebrity that i won't name names with free will, you are monitored by the Masquerade. If you reveal your true nature to humans you will be hunted down by vampire hunters and killed, so you have to make sure to only use your powers on enemies in the combat zones or to be careful using your powers in public.

												Such a good game! True its dated, true it needs a patch ( which can be gotten here http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647/61625/61626/download ) and yes even then some people still have issues running the game on newer systems. But is it worth it. White Wolf has always been one of my favorites when it comes to table top games, and when they made the first Vampire video game ( Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption released in 2000 for PC ) I played it for ages. Also played the 2 games they released for the xbox for Hunter : The Reckoning. What im trying to say here is I'm a big White Wolf fan so my opinion my be slightly biased. Ether away, the game is great in my opinion. Great story telling, awesome dark atmosphere, and great RPG elements. The combat system is a little clunky but they maybe just due to the fact that in game im still a flegling (new vampire) and still working on my skills. In the end if you are a vampire fan at all, or just a fan of dark evil worlds this game is well worth the money.			"

Get the game today and you'll learn about this wonderful underrated gem for it's unique depth and setting. This game is and still does supress most modern games out there for it's immersive storyline, plot, voice acting, and believable unforgettable characters. In fact, VtMB is one example that voice acting is very important for games as well as design. It's well worth it! Just make sure you download the latest Unofficial Patch and try out some mods to alter the gameplay and mechanics if you played game so many times. This game never gets old like a great classic attraction from Disneyland. Even though it is not for Disneyland! I've been playing since early 2007! I bought this underrated game on Amazon when it was pretty cheap in phyiscal form. The boxed retail version includeds a manual, 3 PC-CD discs, and a free soundtrack from a Best Buy preorder.

												If you like Deus Ex and Knights of the Old Republic (KotOR), you're gonna love Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines (VtM:B). The thing it shares with those games are great dialogue and voice acting (VtM:B has the best I've ever heard), great and long story as well as several ways of completing a quest. Like KotOR you have different classes, called clans here, but VtM:B offers seven clans, some more different than others. Each clan have three Disciplines (supernatural powers) and there are also a variety of melee and ranged weapons. Like Deus Ex, you can sneak your way through a lot of the game and hack computers and pick locks.  It was a diamond in the rough when it came, but thanks to years of unofficial patches, it's finally what it was meant to be. I'd recommend the latest unofficial patch, currently  v. 8.4, but mods that run on earlier versions of the patch are great as well.Apart from the lengthy singleplayer story (no multiplayer), it has strong mod support and there are even new mods in the making after all this time. I can't express enough how much I love this game and everything about it.There is another VtM game called Redemption, from 2000, which is set in the same world, but it is more of a Diablo-like RPG. It's cheap at GoG and I highly recommend it, but it's quite different from Bloodlines.			"

Check!Dark humor, and a multitude of memorable, well-fleshed out characters with sassy, BAMF, and creepy all represented? Check, checkity, check!The slaying of vampire stereotypes and a glimpse into the humanity and lack thereof in White Wolf's World of Darkness? Depends on your choices, really.But...A level scarier than some Nossies? Twists that might make a Tzimisce look twice? Views and individuals that may entrance a Toreador? You'll get all of this and more!Seriously though, this is one of my top favorite RPGs. The ability to choose from multiple clans and skill sets for your protagonist gives the game a lot of replay value. You're able to unravel different facts and scenarios depending on your choices. Plus, VTMB has superb dialogue (Just ask the Malks! Though the other voices in their head may stifle yours...). I recommend looking for the unofficial patch by Wesp5 that adds to and fixes bugs in the original content though. And although the graphics could be improved, this game was ultimately a wonderful and very fun experience.			"

												Before anything, know that you will need an unofficial patch to run this game. I cannot tell you how much of a headache it was not knowing this. After you get past that issue, this game is a must-have.It is a gem of an RPG with tons of replay-ability because almost everything has multiple options you can take in different playthroughs. Most quests have this open ended sort of nature. There is no super protective hand holding here. You are given a goal and that is pretty much it. You can solve every problem in whatever way that you fit. Every type of person is welcome, from the sneaky sneaks to the testosterone fueled run & gunner. Sometimes quests may come with some parameters the quest giver wants. These are mostly optional but you will be penalized (EX: being told to go sneaky but going guns blazing = a scolding)The gameplay is also solid and gives you options as well. Are you a fan of 3rd person melee combat? We got you covered! You a fan of FPS shooting mechanics? We also got you covered too.One of the oddest things that I really enjoyed and respect the most from this game is in character creation. When you start, you get to pick a vampire clan to belong to. Certain clans have certain quirks to being them. For most, it is just minor changes in dialog where people would reference it. The 2 clans that are exceptions to this are the Malkavians and the Nosferatus. Malkavians are usually pretty insightful but it is lodged in crazy while the Nosferatus are so deformed that they should never be seen by humans. So what did the devs do? Malkavian players hear whispers in their ear and are given really insane dialog options for everything that can range from gibberish to cryptic hints for both. Nosferatu characters have negative affects to being seen and must get around using the sewers. This really gives character creation some weight even if it is really these 2 classes that are really affected.There is a bit of a learning curve because not much is explained about your stats for you so you may make a few mistakes early on and, at least for me, there was some issues with direction and finding quests. And if you’re one of those people who prefer graphics over gameplay for some reason, this game isn’t for you. All and all, great game and worth playing through at least once if you don’t get hooked.

												I'd like to preface by saying this is the review of the game with the latest unofficial patch by wesp. My applause to wesp.I'm about to be honest and give this great game a hard review. No doubt that this game is quite unique in what it offers, a traditional RPG experience in a dark themed vampire world. The best part of it hands down is the story and the immersive atmosphere of the game. The story and the text is so deep and extensive that you lose yourself just talking to so many characters and getting insight into their stories and background information of the latest happenings.I have a few issues with it so here comes the tough love;1. It is unplayable without the patch2. Even with the patch it has its share of buggy moments3. Combat :(Oh dear. This is what stopped this game from being the my top 5 RPG games of all time; RPG being my favourite genre of games. It really kills the immersion and knocks down a potentially near perfect game (for its time). The combat is just so wonky and I wouldn't take issue with this if the game was a lot more focused on interaction in the world, solving mysteries and story driven. However a decent chunk of the mission design is combat based and its painfully bad to the point where I just took every shortcut and option possible to avoid it, including console commands later in the game because I hated the combat so much. I could go into more detail, but I'll leave it at that.4. Furthermore the game is a little clunky in places as you go through it and I've had a few times where the game just freezes.5. I also had to do additional tweaking of the game just to prevent motion sickness by adjusting FOV, resolution and playing 3rd person often when I felt a little sick (despite FOV fix)6. There are sound issues that have to be also seperately addressed in settings to prevent echoingStory 10/10Graphics (doesn't mater)Gameplay (8.5/10)Controls (♥♥♥♥ed)If you have the time and energy to give modify this game with the official patch and tweak it to get it running properly you will 100% enjoy this game if you're an RPG fan, however those who are new to PC gaming or steam I'd avoid it because of the modifications neccessary for optimal experience. I'd only recommend this game with the patch and tweaks!Final Verdict: 8/10 Overall. Solid experience with an excellent story, brought down unfortunately by the controls and combat. Takes a spot in my top 10 RPG games.  "

												Great game, detailed in-depth storyline.The choices you make in the game follow through with you later on. So you can be a badass that listens to no-one, or be the good little asskisser. The game is similar to Mass Effect in that regard. You can also use different powers like Seduction, Persuasion, Intimidation, etc. You can hack computers, pick locks, etc. It's a very good game even today. It'll have a couple bugs here and there but nothing game-breaking.If you were considering at getting this game, do it. It'll keep you busy for many hours and it's pretty fun and a bit freaky sometimes.Also, there's an unofficial patch out there that'll help update the look of the game somewhat.

												VTMB is by far one of the greatest rpg's ever made. I have replayed it so many times and I still am not tired of it yet. Santa Monica through Hollywood are my favorite parts of the game. I think that it was such a terrible trajedy that this game was so rushed and they weren't able to fully finish it and give it the full potential. With the unnoficial patch, this fixes many of the bugs and restores cut or rushed content. I would also reccomend the clan quest mod, which is phenominal in of itself. I am a huge rpg fan, but I despise what games have turned into. ""Rpg's"" today have become nothing more than dull writing, ""go here, kill, come back"" with no depth, choices, moral dilemas, different routes of doing something, etc. These are what make an rpg good in my opinion. VTMB shines in these areas. The writing is superb and at many times hilarious. The atmosphere is dark and gothic, and makes me quite nostalgic. There are actual moral dilemas, choices, and depth. This very may well be the last of it's kind, and I will play this game possibly to my final days. This masterpiece is the last remenent of what true rpgs and good games are. I recommend this to anyone that enjoys games that I have described. Just make sure to get the latest version of the unnoficial patch for bug fixes and restored content. I think it's so amazing that people are still keeping this game alive even to this day.			"

												After playing this game once as a kid, then trying for the life of me to remember it, I finally found it on Steam and was able to revel in it's glory. The ability to play as so many different types of vampire gives the game an entire different feel with every playthrough. The Malkavian sillyness for a comedic playthrough, the Nosferatu stealthy subterfuge playthrough, or the high-end Toreador ritsy playthrough. You get to see the nuances of each end of the vampire clans. I honestly think this is one of the most underrated games I have ever played, and if you enjoy the FPS RPG type games like any Elder Scrolls game or Fallout game, you would enjoy this game. And if you pick it up and play through it with more than one clan of vampire, and still don't like it, I'll send you a personal apology message.			"

												Let's get this out of the way. I admire ambition more than production quality or polish. That having been said explains why I like this game so much. Now, this game has a well-earned reputation for being buggy as all Troika games were and is riddled with unfinished content. It also is most likely not going to play properly without modding, so if any of those three things I just mentioned irritate you, then avoid this like the plague.I like that it's rather ambigious and subtle with its story telling. I like the pacing and I like the atmosphere of most of the game. The weapons are (mostly) balanced against themselves which is uncommon in games like this. The power pools are fun and memorable, the side quests are interesting and I like all of the endings, too.I think the positives outweigh the negatives. Aside from Bishop Vic. Whoever thought that fight was a good idea should flog themselves in the face with a rusted chain as penance.			"

												Despite all it's flaws, this is probably my favourite game of all time. I can honestly say that my first playtrough of VTMB was the most enjoyable experience i've ever had with a video game.Theres just something about it that really draws you into it. The athmosphere, the story, and the amazing soundtrack, all combine into one of the most memorable gaming experiences you'll ever have.If you're even SLIGHTLY a fan of RPG's, then you NEED to get this. Hell even if you're not a fan of RPG's get this game anyway cause it's THAT amazing.I just wish there were more games like this nowadays...			"

												This is one of the best games I've ever played, and I've played it a year ago for the first time so you can believe me when I say it's not nostalgia talking. I am a huge vampire fan and for my entire life I've waited for a game like this, not knowing it was right under my nose the entire time. It is totally worth the full price, and it gets %75 on every sale so there's literally no reason not to buy this.Pros:A great story, accompanied by characters you'll love or love to hatePretty dark  world that feels gothic, even though it's just Santa Monica at nightAged well, graphics would not bother you at all if you're not obsessd with next gen stuff etcGameplay is pretty nice and gives you lots of different options about how to play. You can even finish lots of quests with speechcraft. Adds replayability to the gameIt is pretty realistic, you can't go around butchering people like there's no tomorrow since you'll lose humanity and succumb into the beast, if you try to play like not drinking any blood you'll die. You can even role play and drink the blood of animals/blood packs.Cons:With some builds you can't go too far in the game. Like if you only skilled bloodmagic as your combat choice you can't get passed the sewer episode since creatures there won't give you any blood.Even though the story was great, the ending kinda felt rushed.Game needs to be patched manually before it can be played(not exactly a con, just wanted to point it out)So long story short, BUY THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME YOU WON'T REGRET IT			"

												There's so much I could say about this game, but no love letter would be enough. At this point if you haven't hopped on the Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines train, you probably are woefully out of the loop or you just don't get it and never will. Let me put it this way: ten years after this game's release, there are still entire ad-hoc companies of professionals from the gaming industry designing wholesale conversions of Bloodlines to new engines. That's a boast almost no one can make about their own favorite game. Pick it up or miss out, dummy.			"

												""Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines"" is easily one of the best RPGs I have ever played. I bought it originally in 2004 when it came out, but bought it now on Steam just to have another copy. It's that good. I seriously cannot do enough to recommend it to anybody who has even the most microscopic interest in RPGs. If you like vampires and White Wolf franchises in the World of Darkness, it's an absolute must-buy.If you do buy it, however, you should be prepared to download the official 1.2 patch, or the famous Unofficial Patch by Wesp5. The game does have a few bugs, but either of those patches will solve them. Combat is also a little repetitive, but challenging for all the Clans; it's a mix of point-and-shoot and slice-and-dice melee. However, the game truly shines in its application of the setting and characters, all of which are representative of the World of Darkness, the larger world setting in which vampires, ghosts, werewolves, and all the nightmares of humankind are made real.

There are SO many ways you can play this game and you could even ignore half the quests people offer you and still finish the game. It's never really finished though. I gaurantee you will be back, creating a new character, going through again and again. Long story short: It's addicting.And for a damn good reason too. Your choice actually shapes and affects the game. A lot. There aren't many games that give you any where near as much freedom and options as this game does. And if you sell your soul to the devil in real life in order to gain the ability to actually be bored by this game, you're in luck. The community for this game is incredibly strong and there are tons of mods and additions that you can install for this game.

												This is one of my all time favorite games.  To me, it is one of the best action RPG's made.  The setting and music are great.  It's worth it just for the sound track.  The mechanics for advancing your character are simple, but require thought.  I love that you can play this game almost any way you want: as a shooter, a melee hack and slash, as a dialog adventure, as a stealth assassin...  As vampire lores go, White Wolf's lore is one of the best along with all the other World of Darkness lore hinted at in the game.  Somebody should license the IP from CCP to make a huge, big budget single player sequel to this game.  If you like vampires and ARPG's, this is it.			"

This game is a vampire game and it has many dark elements to it. There are some humorous themes and horror themes in it. One time i found myself laying down outside in a bush hiding from an evil bunny rabbit named fredrick he had vampire fangs and that's how it all begins. You become a vampire rabbit and must eat all the innocent carrots.			"

												Bloodlines did a great job of capturing the dark, off-putting atmosphere inherent to the World of Darkness. It goes from humorous, but unstable characters to supernaturally unnerving very well and is a generally enjoyable experience. Unsurprising since its based off a pen-and-paper RPG, but the roleplaying experience is very fulfilling and your characters will develop as you see fit.However, there are a couple noticeable problems with the game. The melee combat is a little wonky and a little difficult to control to the degree one desires. There are a couple of ""filler"" points in the game where a level extends further than necessary for atmosphere and story-telling purposes. And without patches, the game is unstable.But despite these flaws, the game is definitely worth picking up and playing if you like the World of Darkness, pen-and-paper RPG games, or just like an appropriately dark take on vampire legend.

It is totally worth the full price, and it gets %75 on every sale so there's literally no reason not to buy this.Pros:A great story, accompanied by characters you'll love or love to hatePretty dark  world that feels gothic, even though it's just Santa Monica at nightAged well, graphics would not bother you at all if you're not obsessd with next gen stuff etcGameplay is pretty nice and gives you lots of different options about how to play. You can even finish lots of quests with speechcraft. Adds replayability to the gameIt is pretty realistic, you can't go around butchering people like there's no tomorrow since you'll lose humanity and succumb into the beast, if you try to play like not drinking any blood you'll die. You can even role play and drink the blood of animals/blood packs.Cons:With some builds you can't go too far in the game. Like if you only skilled bloodmagic as your combat choice you can't get passed the sewer episode since creatures there won't give you any blood.Even though the story was great, the ending kinda felt rushed.Game needs to be patched manually before it can be played(not exactly a con, just wanted to point it out)So long story short, BUY THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME YOU WON'T REGRET IT			"

												Purchased originally at about $20One of my all time favorite games, and it's still getting patched by the fans. You absolutely need to download the unofficial patch floating around although it will still have bugs I doubt they will ever fix. Check the forum. That doesn't matter though because the world and dialog and branching paths will keep you coming back. I loved this game so much I got in touch with the composer and we worked together to distribute a proper soundtrack for the game via torrent channels years ago.			"

												Hilarious and atmospheric. If you use a fanmade patch you should find no problems or issues while playing this game. Has a clear storyline behind it and many, many choices.			"
