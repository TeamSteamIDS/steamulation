												I got this game from an indie bundle and I was quite keen on it before installing it. That Lego-style TPS caught my attention and got a good feeling about it. What a fool I was.This is surely one of the worst indie games I've ever played. Everything makes me feel now that I've been scammed, betrayed. I absolutely approve the indie game generation (and actually I'm more into them than into triple-A games) but this is a paradigmatical way of ""let's make something, it might give us money"". And sure, you can say ""hey, don't be so bad to them, they're probably a very little company"", but this becomes senseless when you see that games such as Braid, Hotline Miami, VVVVVV, Super Meat Boy, FEZ and many others have been made by 1-2 people each and they're absolutely astonishing. So this is not an excuse.I was running this game on the maximum settings (it doesn't have any high requirements anyway) and oh my god, the number of mistakes is so huge you should see it for yourself. ALL shadows were going crazy, in EVERY single map. Almost all textlines somehow got crazy too and were IMPOSSIBLE to read, like in a super low resolution. So actually I had to guess what every option did by pressing it. If you don't believe it I do not have any inconvinient in uploading screenshots.The soundtrack was... what could I say? There's only 1 track. Or maybe not. I don't know. If there's more than one, then all of them feels the same. The same boring. Even on the menus. And even though I've listened the same music all way through my total gameplay, I've already forgotten how it sounds.The AI. Oh my damn God, this is one of the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI's I've faced in a very long time. It can be fooled the SAME WAY on Easy than on Extreme difficulty. ALL enemies follow some patterns that after 1-2 waves will be absolutely predictible. Jesus, there was one time where an enemy was facing me but without shooting a single bullet. I stared at him for ten minutes. TEN MINUTES. He didn't do a thing. Again, you won't even image how sad the enemies react until you test it.The game is also astonishingly short. Yet it felt long, because of how boring it was. All chapters were wave-based, and since this game is 1 player-only (together with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI), guess how similar everything looked like. The only stage I actually enjoyed was the chicken massacre one. This was one of those VERY FEW games I ended up playing only for achievements, which were surprisingly rewarding. Yet some of them were unfairly grind-based, condemning you to stay more hours than you wanted to. Since I like achievements and hate to leave things undone, this was quite a pain even if it only took me about 4h to unlock all of them.Overall, do yourself a favour and DO NOT buy or play this garbage. I've been critically disappointed and I'm sure you have plenty of better games in your library. Which isn't hard at all. Only play this game if you wanna check my words and see how bad this game is.2/10 would uninstall again			"

												I can't help but feel a little conflicted in recommending this game. I've played games by independent developers that were less buggy, far more polished, and offered way deeper gameplay...and they were free. Everything about this game just reeks of shareware, including the stupid enemy AI, glitched collision detection, horrible physics, and a rudimentary attempt at integrating cover that just doesn't go anywhere. Nevertheless, the original installment of Foreign Legion is one of the better games out there for wave-based stress relief. If you approach it with the idea that you're going to have some brainless fun for a few minutes, and if you abandon the very notion that this game will offer you the slightest bit of challenge or complexity, you can squeeze a few hours of occasional enjoyment out of this title.

												Pros:         - Achievements are easy to unlock.        - Good for having some instant fun on simple places.        - Acceptable graphics without extreme effects or fog, game runs smooth.        - Variety of weapons.        - Ok game for the priceCons:           - Bad shooting mechanics, aiming is inaccurate for some weapons aswell.          - Horrible character models          - Annoying music you will hear on every mission and menu.          - No replay value except for achievements          - Confusing mini map.          - No weapon change ingame (have to quit to menu)          - Repetitive gameplay (shoot, get ammo, repair...)4.9/10			"

												This game almost feels like it's a parody of something...a total joke. Except it's not funny.The graphics are obviously designed poorly, the textures are unfinished looking, and the world is boxy and cartoonish, yet the lighting and particles will STILL cause your computer to lag. They skimped on what makes things look pretty, and went heavy on the nasty stuff that just slows down your PC. It's like LEGO graphics, but with more lag.The game is repetitive and relatively unengaging. Levels can be completed literally by standing in one spot and doing nothing.Enemies barely present any kind of threat on most difficulties, which is good, because the aim system is so glitchy, the game would become impossible and enormously frustrating if the enemies were made to put up any kind of resistance.Nevertheless, the game is entertaining...for about 30 minutes.Defenitely not something I would recomend to anyone.

												I played this game for a total of 2 minutes and I realized its true purpose. As a CIA agent I found this game to be a spectacular mechanism of legal torture. I have used this in Afghanistan, Iraq, Ukraine, Syria, and Hoboken NJ. After cleverly sitting a terrorist down in a very friendly manor and coaxing them to play Buckets of Blood, the game does the rest of the work for me. After being attracted to the simplicity of the game, shortly thereafter you are racked by terrible sounds and even worse music. As they mindlessly drone onward through a level they are racked with invisible glitched bad guys and are given no sense of direction. My favorite part is how when you are just about to finish any level, they programmed the game to crash just as you are done, rendering all you've done useless. All I have to say is for $4.99. it's much cheaper than a cloth, bucket of water, rope, chair and time worked from me. This game gets a 10/10. Watch out terrorists Foreign Legion: Buckets of Blood is coming for YOU!			"

												I copy and paste this review to both ""Foreign Legion"" titles, because they are just the exact same game, except for the possibillity of playing with other players  and some maps that were not imported into the multiplayer part (!).It is brainless, stupid horde-based enemy shooting and nothing more. This may entertain you for about 2 hours, but don´t expect anything else, the game is really not worth your money or time and I don´t know what to love about besides the humour + the Multi Massacre is a bug Massacre as well. DO NOT BUY THESE!			"

												If you see this game the first time, you probably think it's totally crap. And that's really TRUE. What else did you expect from a game called ""Buckets of Blood""?The soldiers have no faces and even more less AI. The chicken level should be funny ... but it isn't. You can level up, but it brings you ... nothing. You earn money in order to buy ammo - really boring.What it makes fun (and that's the only thing) is to complete the challenging achievements - sometimes. Unbelieveable there's an extra MP sequel out on steam ...			"

												Good for time-wasting on a smartphone or tablet.Not good for hours of fun on a PC.It's a really simple third-person shooter where you defend yourself against invading enemies, earn money for every mission you complete, and buy yourself weapons and accessories. Literally, that's all it is. You can shoot chickens, if that's a redeeming factor to you.In addition, I think this game is poorly optimized. The requirements aren't too demanding, and yet, my framerate hits below 30 even on Simple graphic settings (you can tell it's a Unity game). Here are my specs:Windows 8.1 64.bitAMD A8-6410 Quad Core @ 2.0 GHzAMD Radeon R5-64104 GB RAMI wouldn't even buy this for $5; I'd rather have this game on my tablet with frequent advertisements for free actually, I wouldn't even buy or download this for free at all, period.

												Foreign Legion, Buckets of Blood is the perfect example of a developer creating a casual game that's not simply a frenzied money grab. Despite being an incredibly simple game, and an incredibly small one at release, the developers have worked hard to improve every single aspect of it.While the lower difficulties are pretty much impossible to fail on the harder ones provide genuine challenge. The leaderboards and small meta-game will keep the game interesting beyond the initial 30 minutes of excitement.The LEGO-style graphics are cute but not very pretty and the sounds are about what you'd expect from an indie title.Probably the most important thing you need to know about this game is how much bigger it has gotten since release. Any review written before the major content updates should be considered invalid because the amount of content that has been added by the developers since release is truly amazing and something that we as gamers should reward in this age of Season Passes.

												I was admittedly a little disappointed by this game when I played it.  Its actually not really a bad game.  The main problem I have with Foreign Legion: BoB is the mundane repetitiveness of it.  It's fun for like an hour or so, after that the patterns in the gameplay seem to dry out the experience.  This game has an interesting concept and an original visual style, but it really lacks enough content to get you hooked.  I feel like many F2P games out now offer a more thorough, less buggy, and more fulfilling third person shooter experience.  My advice is save your money, but then again at $5 or less its not a stern steer clear, it might be exactly what someone wants.			"

												After playing for little over an hour i have completed all the missions and then you unlock extreme mode and endless mode. There is however replayability in this game. In order to conquer extreme mode i think you would need some of the higher up level guns so you have a small grind to get there of a few hours. Nothing highere than level 20 im at 10 in an hour so there is that. The levels all playout the same really with small things to change them defend something static and your quite confined to an average size area to do it. There is little bits of cover out there and things to climb for height but there poorly implented and you can just stand in the open if you want to. There no crouch or prone just stand and jump. No sights just right click and it makes the 3rd person view zoom in a little. Except the sniper rifle but other weapons have sights on them.But there is an arcade feel to it as you can achieve headshots and blow bodys to pieces for extra points if you want.The points become cash for all your upgrade some cosmetics ones and some very basic buying of weapons but no customized weapons just as ther come.It plays nice and graphics are ok at best running in 1080p on fantastic setting the (highest one.Overall lot of mindless fun to spend on a quick break or mindless afternoon but nothing more. No story no depth just ARCADE FUN.			"

												If you are looking for a fun game to kill an hour or two with, you won't find it here.. Bland gameplay, bland music, bland sound effects even... The game is probably fun for the first mission, and even in the middle of said mission you will spend it wondering when it will end...The whole point of the game is to make it rain blood, yet it is so unsatisfying that I'd rather just load up Garrys Mod, spawn an army of headcrab zombies on an empty field, then spawn Heavy's minigun and mow them down... That simple activity would be far more entertaining than this whole game, and the thing about Garrys Mod is that what I just talked about is only one of the many things you can do in said game.. Here, however, all you can do is shoot at brainless enemies with rubbish rifles, resisting the urge to aim the rifle at yourself and rid yourself of your painful boredom.This is not worth the investment, unless you are easily entertained and/or have seriously nothing else to do for the next hour or so...

												The controls in this game are pretty under par. The mouse never seems to seemlessly move without jerkyness. The game play is basicly you are this random soldier who defends waves of enemies. I understand this game was made entirely in the free modeling software known as Blender, but I still expected this game to be way better. Shooting chickens does not improve the experience. I paid $2.50 for this instead of buying a few sodas. Pass this game no matter how cheap it becomes. 48/100			"

												I purchased this on sale for a little over a dollar. I figured I found a cheap game that would provide me with some hours of fun. Unfortunately, I was wrong. This game wasn't worth the $1 I paid. It most certainly isn't worth the $5 is usually priced at.Let's roll over the most glaring of negatives here:- The A.I. is the worst I have experienced in any game. There are games that came out 20 years ago that have better A.I. The enemies are designed to run a set path, every time. They will spawn in the same exact spot, beyond the horizon of which you cannot approach without dying, and will run the same route. If you put yourself smack in the middle of their warpath, they will walk past you to continue on their merry way. -Many shooters already suffer from a boring plight of uniformity in gameplay. This indie game commits this crime and takes it step further. Each mission has small variations, but you can expect the exact same experience every time. Enemies spawn from afar, you kill them with some headshots, you wait for the next wave. I have more fun chopping wood. Seriously.-There are a variety of weapons, but only a few that are actually usable. Some accomplish the same thing a more ""powerful"" and expensive weapons does, but with higher ammo reserves and less hassle. Do you love shotguns? Me too, but you won't want to use the one in this game as it does next to nothing without being obscenely close to the enemy, all the while being chewed up by the enemy you are approaching. There are very few CQC encounters in this game, making this weapon, and others, useless.The two positive things I have to say about this game:+It has low hardware requirements. I purchased this to play on my toaster of a laptop. Ran well with only a couple snags.+There is one level where a giant chicken will fall gracelessly out of the sky when you murder all the regular chickens. Among these regular chickens, there a couple doing the dirty deed. At least, it appears that way. The giant chicken shoots eggs out of its♥♥♥♥♥and has twin gatling guns under each wing. This is fun the first time, but will quickly get old.			"

Game also has fun little easter eggs. The game also doesnt have hard achievements so if your an achievement hunter it is worth a look at for some quick achievements.The game missions are pretty cool to, they do vary from defend an area, to escort and just survive.The game is pretty short but is good for killing time or if your bored from your main game i.e. dota 2, tf2 etc5/10 simple and short but a good laugh :D			"

												MOST RACIST GAME EVER!OK SO YOU PLAY AS A BLOODTHIRSTY AMERICAN SOLDIER SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE-EAST WITH ACCESS TO A WIDE ARRAY OF DESTRUCTIVE WEAPONS...YOUR GOAL? KILL AS MANY INNOCENT MUSLIMS AS POSSIBLE!I WILL TAKE SOME EXAMPLES FROM THE GAME STORYLINE...IN ONE MISSION YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW A CIVILIAN BUS THAT DRIVES THROUGH A VILLAGE AND KILL AS MANY INNOCENT MUSLIMS AS POSSIBLE BEFORE THEY GET ON THE BUS. IN YET ANOTHER MISSION YOUR GOAL IS TO PREVENT INNOCENT MUSLIMS FROM ENTERING A MOSQUE BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY, YOU MAY CALL IN AIRSTRIKES, GUN THEM DOWN WITH MACHINES GUNS OR SNIPE THEM OFF FROM A DISTANCE WITH A RIFLE, ANYTHING TO PREVENT THESE POOR INNOCENT MUSLIMS FROM SEEKING SHELTER INSIDE THEIR SACRED MOSQUE.AND THEN IN A SO-CALLED ""BONUS"" MISSION YOU WALK AROUND ON A FARM KILLING ALL CHICKENS YOU CAN FIND TO TRY TO MAKE THE POOR MUSLIM POPULATION STARVE TO DEATH.UNLESS YOU HAVE A FETISH FOR KILLING INNOCENT PEOPLE FOR NO APPARENT REASON, DONT PLAY THIS GAME!I GIVE THIS GAME A SCORE OF 9/10 BECAUSE THE GAME CLEARLY SUPPORTS MULTI-CULTURAL IDEALS SINCE YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM A BIG SELECTION OF SKIN COLORS WHEN CUSTOMIZING YOUR SOLDIER.

												One of the stupidest, most poorly made games of all time. On medium, the game looks like garbage but medium is the only graphic setting that works. On high or extremely high it looks like garbage with some better lighting but produces bad flickering. It doesn't matter how good it runs though because it is one of the most poorly made, unfun wastes of time that I have ever seen. I got it somewhere for 50 cents and that was a ripoff. It is the most sadly generic third person shooting humanly imaginable that seemingly uses a game engine from 1990. B.C.To be fair, you can have about fifteen minutes of laughs until you realize there is nothing to the game besides walking through a predetermined path or guarding something from waves of faceless enemies with the most horribly dry and generic combat that you will ever see in a tps.Tied with Lovely Planet for worst attempts at a shooter game of all time.1/10			"

												An indie take on 3rd person shooters, with all the cons and little of the pros that come from similar titles. The visuals are iffy despite the attempted art style, the sound effects are generic at best and irritating at worst, and the only saving grace is the gun action that emphasizes some skill, but gets squandered by vague hit-boxes, repetitive goals and dumb-as-brick AI routines and responses. Achievements will keep you playing, but nothing else will after the initial glaze is gone. 2/5			"

												This game was on sale for less than $2 so I deciced to get it.At that price I feel I overpaid.The game is SHORT.  The game is almost all defense.  The game doesn't want you to precisely aim so it will not let you.You can finish this game in under 30 mins.  It is a ""wave"" game.  So clear all the waves before the time expires and the scenario will finish.  Even if you complete it in less than half of the time set...Aiming will P### you the #### off.  There is no ""precise"" in this game.  The game gives you a general idea of where you are shooting and where the bullet ends up is decided by the program...not where you aim and not your skill.There is no story.  You enter a scenario and then exit the scenario.  You have a goal, usually defend ""x"", and you fight off waves of enemies.Field of movement...  You want to aim up?  That's fine...until you realize you aren't allowed to aim as high as you want.  Also, there is no running in this game.  The speed you initially move is the speed you will always move.Graphics...  Fine, I saw the graphics in the game's store page and knew what I was purchasing.  But when aiming/looking up I had my screen/vision blocked by the object behind me?  That is bad programming.  How could the programmers overlook the fact that the ""camera"" can be obscured by objects near the player character?  That is not only bad programming but lazy programming.If this game is ever less than 99 cents...I would say ""buy it"".  But at the price it is currently at?  AVOID THIS GAME.  IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY.			"

												After playing through the game a few times, crushing missions, I got the sense that this is more of an “arcade” type game. The emphasis on high scores and timed missions makes me feel like this game was designed to be played only a little bit at a time. You got ten minutes to kill? Play a mission.There’s enough here for a casual gamer looking to kill some time, but there doesn’t really seem to be a story here or even the point to level up except for the fact of getting more powerful guns to kill your enemies easier. Other than that, there doesn’t seem to be any real “drive” for me to keep playing.

The campaign can be easily completed on the same day of purchase but high-score leaderboards, customisation of your Legionnaire, weapon unlocks, and difficulty levels gives the game replayability. Another selling point is that it has one of the most unique boss battles you will probably ever see in video games!			"

												A way fun 3rd Person Shooter! This game can go far in the future if they decide to improve it some more. The graphics are very simple and great to look at. The gameplay is not hard to learn and get used to. The game doesn't take long to beat and get all the Steam Achievements. Its a wonderful game that was very enjoyable all the way to the end. If you love shooters then this is one not to miss out on. This is a great humorous game that puts alot of joy into shooting the enemy. There is not a multiplayer in this game but when they do involve it then this is a must buy because its going to be a hoot to play. There is a massive chicken you have to fight as a boss fight which is funny to fight. I loved playing this game! If you are considering getting it then dont hesitate any further and get it and i know you would enjoy it if you gave it a decent chance.			"

												Mindless fun where you shoot suicide bombers, gunmen, and bazooka guys while defending a target from being blown up with bomb vests and bazooka shells.  There are numerous chickens to be shot up as well.  The wearing of costume props is kinda glitchy though; once you put them on, the props don't come off right away when you unassign them.			"

												A third-person shooter with a nice visual style reminescent of Legos. The play mechanics are acessible and fun, and with the content update of last year, there are many more levels and guns available to the player.A great little title for the small amount of money it costs. Looking forward to the future of this franchise.			"

												With so many indie games in the market it's hard to find one that really is bang for your buck. I purchased this game at $2 during a sale on Steam, and I will say it's worth it's weight in gold. The cartoonish feel with the upgrade-style gameplay makes this game very enjoyable. The levels are pretty quick to complete, but can be challenging during the later levels. Anyone that enjoys a good clean shooter to waste time, and that doesn't have much room on their harddrive, or even doesn't have a good graphics card should pick this game up.			"

												After playing this game for 40 minutes, i've had two game-breaking bugs, a severe headache from strobe-shadows and i have no idea what the pause menu says because it's distorted.The gameplay is simple. Fantastic in its simplicity, but unfortunatley, there is nothing else to back it up.you rank up to unlock weapons and vanity items, but there's no change in weapon dynamic between piston and assault rifle other than it shoots more bullets.a headshot is technically a hat-shot as faces count as bodies. you have to be accurate in your shots, but lack the control to be so at range, I gave up on the sniper rifle when i had to hard-quit the game trying to afford it.This game could be amazing if there was more of it. It needs to fix the blurry text bug, give a tutorial to the player (some kind of shooting gallery level?) impliment more wepons and, if i were to offer a suggestion to the designers, allow for weapon upgrades that enhance accuracy, damage, clip size etc... nothing too fancy and it doesn't even need to change the graphics, it just needs to make more to work for.The game needs more weapons, more to work towards, perhaps tertiary weapons like grenades or stationary weapons...as it stands, three out of five and i'm being generous because of the bugs not being intended.I hope these issues get fixed and will gladly update this review when it is.

												Foreign legions buckets of blood a game i only played shortly and i normaly dont think you should create a review before you finished the game or played it a few hours but im just not compatible with this game here some pros and cons keep in mind its my opinion its subjective+its cheap+low system requierments+cool art/graphic style+unlockable weapons-no multiplayer the game says its only single player but still if you didnt see it here you do-starting weapons are absurdly useless on hard especialy the pistol-movement feels weird-since its 3th person its possible your character is infront of the table but the camera still has the same distance meaning all you see is a table or something different blocking your vision-the gun play doenst feel special its just weird and dull-hard diffeculty abit over the top imoi just dont think the game is worth it it wasnt fun for me the movement felt weird the gunplay just dull and weird the camera was awkward and just the gamplay in gerneral wasnt anything i liked so i now just quickly gave up and playing longer wouldnt change that opinions since those are such basic elements of a game			"

												Appealing aesthetics but an otherwise mediocre game.I bought Buckets of Blood when Steam sold far fewer small and cheap games, rather than the current glut. Now an abundance of superior alternatives are available. Games like this were once freeware before Steam (and especially Greenlight) existed.But hey, I've only played it for over 20 whole hours: there's some dude with almost 60 hours of playtime and another with 140.1 (!), both who give Foreign Legion a thumbs-up. Perhaps there is something deeper here; that I just don't get it, man, and need to reinstall and keep playing...			"

There are some bugs you might be able to push through but overall the game feels like it's in some sort of alpha version. It feels more like an idea than an entire game.Would not recommend unless you are easily entertained.			"
