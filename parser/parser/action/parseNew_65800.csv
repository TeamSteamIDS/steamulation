												Colorful graphics addictive game play and fun all around.  I have amassed over 3000 hours in Dungeon Defenders.  ALL PLAY NO AFK SHOP! I am not even close to done with it yet.Dungeon defenders 2 is on the way but DD1 still has lots of life left to it of this I am certain. At a mere $15 for the base game it is a great deal. When it goes on sale you can even find the complete bundle for under $13! Not sure if you will like it? Try the free demo you have nothing to lose!			"

												Extremely fun game, ruined by its community. Let me explain: The fun in this game is learning, and growing your characters and items in level. The fun isn't in BEING level 100 with level 100 gear. The fun is in PROGRESSIVELY GETTING THERE. But the community is all about boosting, which can give you 30+ levels in an hour, and gifting high level (sometimes hacked) items. So instead of experiencing the joy of progressively getting there, increasing this and that, instead you are suddenly propelled to new heights. And while that boost seems great at the very moment it happened, this pleasure is infinitely short-lived.This is the reason I created my group, Dungeon Defenders Hardcore, for players that care about having fun with the game, not just reaching level 100 ASAP. What then? You know?Other than that, this is an awesome game, and I am looking forward to Dungeon Defenders 2.			"

												I recommend this game on one condition: that you do not play it past completing Insane difficulty. I know my playtime suggest a lot of hours and a lot of fun but the ramp up in difficulty has left a bad taste in my mouth knowing I won't be able to experience the full game unless I grind endlessly. It becomes less of a game about having fun with tower defense and more about min-maxing stats while simultaneously avoiding cheaters who mess up your characters and possessive teammates who think they have the ""optimal placement"" and will sell your towers with wild abandon. It was such a fun game while I played but after a certain point things just got worse and I stopped having fun. I'm just sort of bitter at the end of it all.			"

												This game has provided many hours of fun for many players.  It is definitely worth a look and you should plan to get all the DLC if possible.  It is a tower defense game that allows you to build DPS characters to aide your towers if you want.  So if you like building or just the run and gun or both, it has something for everyone.  Really high end stats and items can take a little time to obtain but it is a lot of fun playing maps over and over again to get those nice items.Note:  Tinkers Lab DLC is not included in the Collection so make sure to purchase it separately.

												Probably one of the most time consuming games I have ever played, and I mean that in the most possitive way possible. I have put countless hours into playing this game and it was all well spent. All the gameplay is smooth, each class helps out the other when you get to higher difficulties. HOW COULD I FORGET THE BEST PART, THE LOOT SYSTEM, you're always looking for better quality items for your hero, and it's actually a nice grind.I am not going to make a huge paragraph about this game but all I can say is, it's worth every penny. Buy it.			"

												So after 500 hours in this game and reaching end game items I feel like I can write a objective and well-informed review about the game.Overall, I don't recommend it.However, if you want to play with friends, say you buy a 4-pack (on sale, of course) and you stay off the dlc's, it is a nice purchase. Playing the game all the way up to lvl 70 pre-nightmare mode, the game is lots of fun and very unique. It is after that point where it just isn't worth it.The person in charge of development got really greedy with the game and started releasing lots of dlc's, each one containing either one hero or one map. Which means you have to spend a lot of money to get the full experience of the late game.On top of that, nightmare mode is such a cliff that you are pretty much forced to buy the summoner and EV dlcs in order to progress through it, as well as farm for hours in order to get decent items. The big flaw in the game is that it relies on RGN; the items rely on stats that are randomly generated. And instead of fixing this system, the devs decided to just give you more items so hopefully you eventually get a lucky drop. Most of the items generated are either missing key stats, or have negative values on them thus reducing your chances of getting anything decent.The trading community is slowly dying if not dead, since most good players decided to move onto better games.So like I said, I enjoyed the first few hours pre nightmare, but after that it just isn't worth your time or money.PS. Has your family or a good friend ever drag you to do something you do not wanna do but you do it anyway out of the goodness of your heart? yeah... that's why I played 500 hours of this game			"

Everywhere will be a river of blood and body of orcs, that sunk into oblivion , we will step over them and kill new hordes , trying to get the coveted award.Game highly recommended for all fans of TD!!!Rating 9 from 9,5Sorry for my English!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Dungeon Defenders это не обычная Tower Defense - это экшен+рпг TD с видом от третьего лица и у разработчиков вышло просто отличное сочетание жанров. Игра наполнена всяческого рода развлечениями, на самом деле всех видов. ДД имеет не только классические карты, когда вы пытаетесь защитить ваш кристалл от полчищ врагов , но и различные типы испытаний , такие как уничтожение вражеских кристаллов , обора своего кристалла без башен , охота на индеек , даже испытание помощи Амуру в любовных делах ,когда вы будете выступать в роли его помощника сводя между собой пары одиноких орков.- В игре очень красочная и вычурная графика.

Каждый игрок может создать в игре магазины и продавать все что пожелает, ну почти все..- Вся экипировка имеет уровень и игрок может может поднять этот уровень , инвестируя в оборудование много манны, очень много.Сюжетной линии как таковой в игре и нет. Но все это вторично. Почти все времяпрепровождение в игре, мы будем проводить убивая монстров ! Мы будем получать дикий фан делая это. Получая уровень за уровнем, апгрейдя оружие, мы будем убивать зеленых и не только орков всевозможными способами. Повсюду будут реки крови, ну или кристаллов, так как крови в игре и нет. Мы будем идти вперед переступая, через тела канувших в лету врагов, стремясь заполучить желанную награду. !Игра рекомендуется для всех поклонников TD !Моя оценка 9,5 из 10!!

												No, I would not recommend this game to anyone, for any reason. At the tail end of of almost a thousand hours, and after careful deliberation, I cannot find anything redeeming in Dungeon Defenders. Not its single-player, not it's multi-player, certainly not its Tower Defense, not its loot mechanics, and, most assuredly, not its community. The whole Dungeon Defenders experience, from the first achievement for simply following a tutorial, to the last achievement in killing four giant snowmen and an alcoholic Santa Claus, is garbage. Let me get this out of the way – The original thirteen maps of Dungeon Defenders and the original four classes, they're fine. The original, vanilla Dungeon Defenders experience, although simplistic, has a very clear and defined progression. Your four classes – the Apprentice, the Squire, the Huntress, and the Monk – are fairly well balanced for both solo play and multiplayer, and because you can swap characters during maps in solo play, you can make doubly strong defense setups with combinations from those four classes. It is entirely possible, with good tower strategies, to go from the beginning of the game to the end of the game – that is, from Deeper Well to Glitterhelm Caverns - all on the same difficulty with hardly any farming, up to the tail end of Insane difficulty. The original Dungeon Defenders, simplistic it may be, is roughly fifty hours of a tight tower defense experience with a lot of experimentation possible within it.Enter Nightmare. Enter spiders, enter djinns, and enter sharkens. Which, alright, those aren't bad. These are enemies that are designed to target and disrupt your defenses so that you'd have to reconsider your defense setups. Up to Insane, you weren't really punished for not using all four classes, so Nightmare is the point where the game decides to kick you around a bit and force you to play it better. So, you'll go back and level up a new class to use in conjunction with your usual class and take another crack at it.So with a format like this, how did this game get screwed so badly?DLC upon DLC happened, ramping the game's difficulty by numbers up faster than players could keep up with it. You could gotten away with playing with lower stats if it weren't for the Sky City patch that introduced Goblin Copters. Goblin Copters dropping their buffed up Ogres on your defenses alone increased the minimum stat requirements for maps by quite a bit. After that, maps began spamming Ogres ad nauseum just as a difficulty supplement rather than having actual difficulty within the map's designs. Suddenly, people couldn't keep up with the game's difficulty without farming late waves of Survival mode for incrementally better gear. But the random number generator was bugged, so it wasn't giving out progressively stronger gear as often as it should have been. And so, people spent more time farming in the game than they do actually progressing in it. Entire class DLCs – The Series EV, the Jester, and the Summoner – were released just to keep the game possible to beat, rather than to supplement the game with new and interesting ways to play it. By the real end of the game, those classes are a requirement to succeed. If you favored the Squire or the Apprentice when you began playing the game, they are going to gather dust in your character roster because the real end of the game doesn't even have actual tower defense in the way that the very first thirteen maps do.Let's also keep in mind that most of the DLC is outsourced to the winners of map contests held by Trendy on their official Dungeon Defenders forums (that unnavigable mess) and other DLCs are very clearly sourced to a different set of developers from the initial game. What this means is that there's a ton of maps in the game that have an inconsistent graphical quality and difficulty – difficulty, by the way, at this point rarely amounts to anything more than using the same three correct classes over and over in the correct spots with no room for experimentation. Then, those maps take anywhere from twenty to forty minutes at a time because of rapidly inflating mob counts per wave.Look, I get that a difficulty name like “Nightmare” means, okay, the game is going to be hard now, and that naturally does mean you're going to need higher stats to beat older maps, as well as be pretty damn tough in order to meet the requirements of the endgame. That's standard difficulty in game design. And Dungeon Defenders does that! Initially, Nightmare mode challenges your perception of building maps to compensate for spiders dropping in behind your defenses, sharkens who can charge in and completely push them out of the way, and djinns who can just outright destroy them. But, the metagame changed. Suddenly, the solution is always a line of summons on a buff beam underneath a stack of auras. Every special mob and the threat presents is handled by that solution alone. And with that one-size fits all solution, it becomes the only solution that maps are designed around. Difficulty is reduced to a stat requirement on a board that says, “Here. This is how difficult it is, this is what kind of numbers you need to scrape by on the skin of your teeth with, this is what kind of numbers you need to beat it comfortably and farm it, and this is what kind of super low number you can beat it with to stroke your ePeen. These are the points you need to put on the DLC Summoner, the DLC Series EV, the Monk, and the Huntress. Haha, what? Apprentice and Squire? Those aren't relevant.” And that says nothing of building a character for tackling bosses.Once you get somewhere new in Dungeon Defenders, get comfortable. You're gonna be there for a while, until you get lucky. By a Trendy developer's own admission, the stats on drops are bugged so that they rollover – become worse than they should be when they're spawned – and thus the progression is more restrictive than it was ever intended to be. And indeed, DLC was released to try and get around that too. But DLC can't fix a fundamentally broken game, and in fact, it actually broke it more, because the loot coming out of it was too god, so it came out gimped, per that bug. It is actually to the point where, in order to maximize your chances of getting loot that will give you better stats, and thus, help you move forward, an X-Box controller emulator was devised in order to take advantage of splitscreen. This is so you can have four chances at a map's rewards, rather than just the one, for your thirty minute run of what-the-hell-ever map. And I expect that this tool was only ever intended for the obsessive munchkin crowd, but it rapidly turned into a requirement to proceed at all in the game. This is not tower defense. This is just farming and reaping the rewards of poor soil.So, now that you understand what a majority of Dungeon Defenders is, I want you to take a look at the Most Helpful (All Time) reviews here on Steam for this game. Most of them are from people with people whose hours number in the multiple thousands. I hope that at least explaining the arbitrary farming puts into context those hours. Dungeon Defenders, even with all its DLC, does not have nearly enough content to justify those lengths of time, or, hell, even my own, and by its own design, it's not a game I could recommend to anyone.It's a bad game.

You go back to the tavern and relize the reward has crappy stats.

Summary/Overview  Dungeon Defenders is a fps, tower defense, strategy and RPG game developed by the nice people over at Trendy Entertainment. The only series they are currently known for is Dungeon Defenders with only two games so far, Dungeon Defenders and Dungeon Defenders II. Dungeon Defenders four starting heroes are  the Squire, Monk, Huntress and Apprentice in which you are called upon to save your parents, adult versions of yourself from the land of Etheria. The last map is called Crystalline Dimension which is the only map in the whole entire game in which you will encounter your parents that have been kidnapped frozen into a crystalline substance. You face an enemy, a final boss known as the Old one which is a term that is symbolic of a satanic type demon. Your main goal in the whole game is to survive wave after wave with hordes of enemies such as sharken, djinn, goblins, trolls, ogres, wyverns, spiders and others as you have thousands of enemies usually per wave. The end goal is to survive all waves and make it to a final boss on each map on the campaign mode. It has a story, xp leveling system, loot, pets, items, weapons and accessories characteristic of most role-playing games. Features  Trading System/ Farming Community/ Trading Forums      If you have been playing computer games for a long while and have never heard of farming, let me now educate you on it and my personal pet peeve and vendetta with it. Farming is an action in role-playing games that are composed of loot and is needed in the progressing of the game in order to improve damage and defense output against enemies and large bosses. Farming is a systematic process and cycle that habitually reoccurs whereby players grind to get a variety of weapons, armor, pets and accessories with different tiers, rarities and qualities. So, farming by itself seems like a rather harmless endeavor that was originally meant for the progression of games in which a random number generator selects random stats, some good, some missing in key areas and some with all important stats that use specific algorithms towards item production which is then consumed by users for their own personal gain within the game and can even be sold on trading forums.  The Misconceptions of the Farming Agglomerated Half of the Community     Hackers have been present in Dungeon Defenders since the first three months of its PC release in late 2011 right before the Christmas holiday. Item checkers were called upon to volunteer their time given special privileges and spreadsheets in order to validate the authenticity of all stats on weapons, pets, duped event items without a trace, and duped weapons, pets and armor that lie outside of the minimum and maximum values they are given to work with that are spawnable in the actual game. The random number generated catastrophe led others at the time in 2013 towards a new downloadable content map called Lab Assault that soon came out. Trendy's only motivation for releasing this map was to generate more numbers in the community since many people were leaving their game and numbers of people playing in the community finally reached an all-time low before summer 2013. In order to avoid this, they instituted what is now one of the largest farming endeavor maps into more modern gaming. Lab assault is a tedious and laborious map that last anywhere from three to four minutes per run meant to provide users with a very quick shortcut towards obtaining the highest armor in the game. Armor ranges in the following order of rarity: godly, mythical, transcendent, ultimate, ultimate plus and ultimate plus-plus. In order to use transcendent items, one must be level 78, ultimate; level 90; and ultimate plus and beyond; the max level 100. The goal is to get armor pieces of the same kind in order to form a full set composed of four pieces. Then, once you get a full set, you get a set bonus which increases your overall stats as well as any resistances you have taken time to upgrade. Pros & ConsPros•A rewarding game environment in which other users collaborate and can farm items together while having fun smacking ogres, goblins, trolls and tough bosses together over and over towards mastery of different defense placements and setups•A nice dedicated community of people driven by their love and passion to see the game's survival•A tactful game that never gets boring, stale; there is always so much to do•Great trading community, armor types; rarities, characters and downloadable content worth every dollar you spend on it•Classes need to constantly be switched at the forge in game in order to place defenses, which usually one player on a good team does while the rest defendCons•Terribly addictive and when I mean terrible addictive, I mean to the point of ad nauseam due to the farming nature of the community divided half and half into the casual and then the hardcore dedicated regular players that farm every day and week•Hackers always present though there have been future steps in the sequel, Dungeon Defenders II to fully prevent hackers because they remodeled their servers to be client-side instead of server-side•Endless replayability •Each round can last up from forty-five minutes up to an hour per run on the top difficultyOverall 8 - I do  recommend it but be careful to the incredible addictive tendency of the game's elements, the trading system and the farming, darker side of the community    Overall, Dungeon Defenders is a family-friendly game for all the kids, teens and adults out there looking for something fun and endless to play in the role-playing and tower defense cross-platform genre. However, due to its constant persistence on the farming side of the community, it has inevitably led to its downfall and any chance of surviving. The community development team currently has been doing update after update to improve upon the game's features, maps, rewards and mechanics. However, this also means that those that are addicted to the game like I was can never leave it or it will be much harder to.  I have presented my views towards this over time towards the community and also questioned it in light of all the paradigms that have overtime posed a great emotional, cognitive, psychological and illicit response in the community. At first, my thoughts both towards Trendy Entertainment behind their support I found on Facebook upon Dungeon Defenders II when it was in early access stating that people needed to take off work to farm all day long after the new update they had made, I decided not to support a company like this whose hidden intention is to keep a dying user base at times constantly hooked and coming back. This is the reason why downloadable content in the early planning stages were released so rapidly to maintain that ambition and degree of pleasure over selfish greed, ambition and callous actions that promote a negative overall attitude in the community instead of humility and helping others before yourself. This alone led to people sometimes maintaining bragging rights and at the end of the time farming for virtual wealth while maintaining their own insecurities that some, though not all may have in  real-life.

 Dungeon Defenders is a great game!	Firstly, there has been a lot of hate/reviews recently that downvote Dungeon Defenders (DD) because of the kerfuffle between Trendy and Wildcard.  This area is for  GAME       reviews not for  COMPANY	 reviews and fanboy/girl hate	Now on to the important thing, Dungeon Defenders is a relatively old game (considering the amount of new content released to steam every few months), However, that does not stop it from being, at least as far as im concerned, the greatest game of its genre.Now the graphics of DD are what I would describe as slightly ""cartooney"" and while that might not be some peoples first choice I believe its perfect for the game.The gameplay itself is quite nicely balanced accross all the difficulties (easy-insane) until you hit nightmare (the difference between medium and insane is the same as insane and nightmare) and the levelling system is pretty evenly scaled. Beating the game is quite possible both solo and playing online, it just requires a little bit of time. The gear system is one of my faviourite things about DD, that and having your own person tavern to show off the amazing loot you find. To play the game on all difficulties and succeed you definitly need the dlcs (at least the character ones) nightmare difficulty and tinkerers lab for some easy farming, but if you pick up on sale you get get it all for pretty cheap, and its worth the investment if you like the game as much as I have.Community wise the players are usually pretty fair, if you need any help or advice  DD Runs'n'Giveaways	 usually has people on that will gladly help you out or provide advice. Occasionally people will kick you without reason when joining a public game, or you will find the odd person with ""hacked"" gear. But as far as I'm aware these are just people who dont know how private games work and people who don't have the skill to beat the game without cheating. Also thanks to the hard work of the Community Development Team we've had 2 new patches this past year both with excellent maps and rewards as well as cheating players on the decline.When first getting into the game you may not find too many servers up, this is generally because of 1 or 2 reasons. Reason 1 theres no one on at that moment/your level is too low to see their games, Reason 2 the people that are on are playing private games not public games.

												Beautifully made, Fun, Challenging, Funny. with the added bonus of co-op, I can't recommend this game enough. With influences from world of warcraft and almost any dungeon roamer game, you will fall in love with the characters, levels and play style of the game. Definitely recommended to play with friends but single player will hold up just as well.. A unique expirience and plenty of hours of gameplay await			"

												As a Linux User i cannot recommend this game if you are planning to play this game on Linux. There are many issues with the Linux build, to give you examples: - Crystals are not flowing to you when you are around them. - The Game crashes instant when a character Series EV Joines the game of is in the game on multiplayer. This 2 issues alone makes the game not good playable, in fact i have stopped playing this game because this kind of ¨buggyness¨. This are known issues with the Linux build, its sad that the developers of this game not fixing this kind of bugs in the Linux version. I you playing this game on Windows, buy this game its lot of fun, but if you are on Linux as i do, dont buy it! you will regret it. its a waste of your money,			"

												Dungeon Defenders is a Action-RPG/Tower Defense hybrid, set in a light hearted fantasy world. The game is fun enough when played alone, but really shines when you grab 3 friends with you and experience the unique possibilities and synergies of the classes.The gameplay varies quite a lot from character to character, from the Apprentice that offers you basic tower defense gameplay to the Summoner (DLC) that plays more like an RTS. The vast variety of the gameplay styles of the characters and the RPG elements, such as leveling up your character and collecting better gear, offer great reply value. Many of the DLCs offer additional content that adds to the value of the game and thus buying the entire bundle is the most cost efficient way to get the best experience.Dungeon Defenders brings a more unique variant of the Tower Defense genre to the table, which makes it a great purchase for someone looking for a good co-op game and any fan of said genre.

												My very first experience with this game was simply trying to get together with a few friends since a couple of us got it on sale. We then spent the next half hour trying to figure out why I couldn't join the game. Apparently this dev is so busy filling their games with DLC and cancer they can't be bothered to keep the OSX/Linux versions up to date with the Windows one.I can completely understand developers not releasing games on those platforms because it simply might not even be worth the effort to do so due to the lack of people using them. But I do not understand why you would ever release a game on a platform and then fail to keep those versions up to date with the primary version. As such, I'm going to refund this game and probably never give this dev another chance since they clearly don't have their act together when it comes to supporting their own game.			"

												One of the greatest tower defense games of all time!This game takes into account a lot of features players enjoy.The ability to customize player statsWant to have 2 heroes dedicated to traps and have 1 dedicated to dps? You can do that! On top of that you can switch between heroes each wave to build traps and then switch to your dps hero.Tons and tons of content, this is a old game now and was continuely patched for a long time adding in more content to an extent that it is now hundreds of hours of content for players. Loot sharing! You can collect gear to customize with later, or even trade to your friends!Lastly, the game really incoporated solo vs party well, because traps matter so much you won't find yourself needing other players to contribute to attacking, you can solo the game just as easily as grouping. However! Grouping can have the upside of the fact it means you can switch all your best gear to 1 specific trapper and have everyone use different trappers with their best gear, rather than you spreading your gear out equally among your own trappers. This will make sense the more you play it, but they really did the game justice to solo/party balance.			"

												Magic towers? Check. Defensive auras? Check. Bombs? Check. Barriers? Check. Huge weapons? Check. Hordes of monsters waiting patiently behind strategically placed doors until players are ready? Check! Action RPG and tower defence hybrid Dungeon Defenders brings all those things to the table, plus more. It may not be the sharpest looking, musically creative, or thoughtful game out there, but it makes up for all of that by just being a lot of fun. Leaving their kids behind, the four legendary heroes of Etheria have set out to vanquish evil, loot caves and, if they're like most heroes, probably spend a fair bit of time in the local tavern. Their children, who had been content to stay behind and dream of adventure, accidently unleash an ancient power and soon find their castle surrounded by monsters. Crazy kids. True to their heritage, the young warriors take up their weapons and prepare to defend their home. The story is cute, but aside from a few brief cutscenes, largely irrelevant. The premise of Dungeon Defenders is simple: protect your crystal against hordes of monsters by building towers. There are four classes you can choose to play: the apprentice, who summons magic-shooting towers; the squire, who builds fortifications and medieval-style weaponry; the huntress, who lays traps and snares; and the monk, who can create auras to aid friends and hinder foes. Each class is diverse in their skills and abilities, and can be further customised each time they level up by assigning points to them, their towers, or both. In addition, there is a plethora of loot dropped each level that can give your heroes an edge in a fight. Even pets can be obtained to help you out! As you level up, new skill points are not your only advantage. All fortifications you build require mana for construction, which you can collect from treasure chests or fallen foes. Each time you level up, your maximum mana capacity increases. This allows you to store mana for repairs, upgrades and special class skills. Unfortunately, not all classes are created equal. As a team of four, the apprentice, squire, huntress and monk are a near unstoppable force of perfect complementary skills. Working individually, however, is a far different story. The apprentice and squire can hold their own, but if you prefer to play solo, you can say goodbye to much success with either the huntress or monk. There are 13 campaign maps in total (plus more through paid DLC), and each requires a new strategy. Early maps tend to have few chokepoints and only one crystal to defend, while later maps are a veritable maze of potential enemy paths, and may have up to four separate crystals. Maps can support up to four players (six on some of the DLC maps), and enemy health is scaled accordingly. As a result, you can tackle missions alone or online with friends and enjoy a challenge either way. Each set of maps has a unique feel. There are maps set inside servants' quarters, the throne room and the forge, while later challenges take you outside to the gardens or onto the roof. The cartoony, cel-shaded graphics are a delight and suit the light tone of the game well. Bright green gardens on one map are an excellent contrast to the dreary, rain-splattered turrets of another, and the diverse designs really set the maps apart from one another. Character faces look a little odd, but heroes are otherwise equally attractive; especially the apprentice, whose face is hidden beneath his pointy wizard hat. Unfortunately, different genders for each hero are only available as paid DLC. Bummer. Between maps, you return to your own special tavern, in which you can buy and sell equipment, organise your inventory or admire any achievements you earned, which take physical form as trophies. You visit the tavern of whoever is hosting the current game, which means you can show off to your friends, too! A word of warning though: in-game trophies can be earned in any mode, but achievements can only be completed through ranked online play. Annoying, but a necessary precaution considering the game is open to modding in offline or non-ranked play. Clearing all maps on medium takes around 15 hours, but there are three harder difficulties available (Hard, Insane, and Nightmare), complete with more powerful loot. Extra challenges are provided that mix things up too, such as a map where the crystal changes locations or where roles are reversed and you go on the attack. Many of these require multiple players though, so it's far more enjoyable if you can play with your friends. Online play functions amiably, but some further polish would have been beneficial. Joining or creating a game is easy enough, but at higher levels, I was often kicked the second I set foot into a game without explanation. Unlike many other multiplayer games, there is no voting system to kick people, so if one person has a problem with you, you're gone. There's no loot designation system either, so it's a free-for-all on the best drops. That said, most players are relatively blasé about gear and leave it alone to be auto-sold at the end of the round. On the bright side, the game natively supports voice chat. I may have initially been disappointed by the focus on online play, but these fears quickly passed as I discovered what an enjoyable game Dungeon Defenders is. 13 maps with 15-20 hours of play is a considerable amount of initial content, but the extra challenges and loot-hunting are what will keep you coming back. Working out strategies and tower placement is a great fun, and finally succeeding in your strategy is immensely satisfying. Some of the online features are a little rough, but if you enjoy a good tower defense game, then you should not miss this one.Highly Recommended "

												I picked Dungeon Defenders up during the holiday sale and had hoped it would be another decent tower defense game.  Ever since the Starcraft & Warcraft III (Cube Defense) days these kinds of titles have been able to deliver a lot of depth and strategy for relatively simple mechanics. Sadly, Dungeon Defenders failed in most of those aspects and felt a lot more like a cheap iPad knockoff of a good game.  The game has an arbitrary item drop system that constantly requires futzing with upgrades and switching between weapons - the RPGness of this title was disappointing to say the least. No tower mazing. Uninteresting weapons. Repetitive gameplay. Worst of all is the autoaim feature, which redirects shots in completely unanticipated ways - no option or mod exists to disable (WHY?). The game runs on the Unreal Engine 3, and it does look nice, so there's that. Play Sanctum 2 for a much better executed TD in a similar theme. If you want something hardcore just skip to Defense Grid for a proper TD. 4/10 for a very mediocre tower defense title.			"

												Dungeon Defenders, in the beginning, was very fun. It is definitely a fun game. However, when playing online, there's no fun. It requires an insane amount of hours to actually build up the required amount of armor on a high level character to warrant putting down towers. You become useless the moment you play online. Single player is only fun for a little while, it eventually gets repetitive, and to be honest, impossible. You can not progress in this game by yourself. So unless you have a few dear friends to play local with, I would absolutely not recommend this game.			"

												You've more likely than not heard this kind of illumination made about specific preoccupations, regardless I mean it: you have to play Dungeon Defenders with various individuals. No doubt in the world, you could battle alone and come up short more than once over the different levels and peril missing the point of convergence of the beguilement, yet in the event that you store up two or three accomplices for near to assemble, or even run online with sporadic untouchables, you'll find boundless hours of entrancingly addictive gameplay as it was depended upon to be enjoyed. Consider Dungeon Defenders as a four-player tower resistance stimulation converged with a third-solitary activity title. You pick a picture from one of four scandalous classes: the Apprentice (likewise called Mage); the Squire (additionally called the Warrior); the Huntress (additionally called the Elven Ranger); the Monk (aka...well, the Monk). Every class has one of a kind outstanding limits that they converge with particular checked structures. The Monk, for example, is a warrior class that can summon circle confined qualitys that can do things like direct enemies or do hurt after some time. The Squire, then again, summons all the more clear limits, setting up dividers and other direct harm securities to stop adversaries and allow particular classes to put the hurt on. The objective, plainly, is to survive every one of the surges of foes. Every wave makes in number as you go on, and get powerfully troublesome with every player that joins the battle (players can join mid-battle in the midst of waves). Between every crowd of enemies players get an opportunity to re-try, redesign and manage their guards. A definitive need is securing the Eternia Crystal; on the off chance that it falls, the level is over. Before schedule in the crusade the levels have particularly crucial frameworks with just a solitary jewel and all around few stifler concentrates, yet things get fundamentally more basic in the second half, where you're given different significant stones to secure and a generously more basic blend of enemies to battle. A condition that you'd plan to wind up absolutely terrible understands how to stay fun all through in light of the way that every level obliges you to fit in with its exceptional association and the assorted sorts of foes you experience. Emergency control is in addition fundamental; when limits begin to fall, just a strong and instructive social affair will recoup and hold the line. Every class has a segment on the fight zone, yet they're unquestionably not all made similar. Play a few amusements on the web, and you'll see why the Squire is the most comprehended class. Not just would he have the ability to wreak pulverize with his contention assaults, yet his protective structures can bargain hurt besides leave foes shocked. Trade classes make up for lost time to his ability in the greater aggregates, yet the Squire rockets before different players at an early stage since experience is disgracefully not shared. The Squire simply doesn't appear to have any basic lacks – something I don't think I could say for some diverse class – and can be a touch of baffling to hoard with when they're executing everything before you have a shot. With a respectable social event, even a get wrap made up of sporadic untouchables, I rapidly got myself absolutely dependent on Dungeon Defenders. Each level plunges relative target, yet as I said some time starting late, critical similarity keeps things enchanting. What moreover keeps me caught is the steady stream of plunder and experience. Wander up your legend and get-together that altogether huge items keeps the outstanding carrot on a stick incessantly dangling before you. I'm a sucker for that carrot, as well, and it makes even annihilation to some degree less asking. Losing a fight sucks in Dungeon Defenders, yet you find the opportunity to keep the riches you find in any case. In the event that you kick the holder you essentially set up the new hotness you've secured, allot focuses into unobtrusive components on the off chance that you wandered up, and go at it once more. While getting plunder gets me, after it's managed, I'm left with blended presumptions. The look of your weapon changes – and man do they look wonderful now and again – yet that is it. In spite of what top you put on, or mid-section plate you wear, your character appears, from every angle, to be unclear. It may not seem like that giant of a strategy to everybody, beside RPG geeks like me, obviously particular gadget an essential part of the move; I cherish plunder pummeling, regardless I oblige others to perceive how dissident I am just by looking. On the upside, in any case, I revere how you can level up weapons, giving you motivation to stick to contraption, and something to change in the midst of the times when your character wander up. Butchering creatures yields Mana, which you use to purchase towers amidst every stage. After every level there's customarily Mana left over, so you can utilize this – furthermore any Mana you get for offering unneeded things – to put into your gear. All of gear can for the most part be upgraded a few times, permitting you to change its inconspicuous components to better suit your playstyle. My Monk, for instance, is about Auras instead of direct assaults, so I always spend my overabundance Mana on apparatus levels that permit me to better my part as a fortify class. Wander up weapons is an enchanting approach to manage keep me included when I'm not procuring plunder or getting adapting, constantly giving me something to do to feel like I'm advancing. I can talk for the term of the day about how hypnotizing a round of Dungeon Defenders is, yet I can't highlight enough that it is so fundamental to discover individuals to play with. Whether it's four-player neighborhood or online play – or any blend thereof – you have to play with others. Playing alone is, well, pulverize, and accomplishes baffling and exhausting gameplay. Merge a couple classes, and the limitation of players who can improve and every level changes into a debilitated frag fest.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time. In my religion, this is known as Art(TM), but you can call it ""Threewording"")			"

												I should love this game.A tower defence game with heavy roleplaying elements, vibrant colours and plenty of different strategies to choose from.The core gameplay actually really speaks to me too. You control your hero, selected from 4 different types (or more, we'll get into that) and defend the Eternia Crystals using both an assortment of weapons and summoned magical defences.There are wizards that summon elemental towers, knights that summon medieval fortifications and siege weapons, monks that work with auras and hunters that employ traps.All of these feel different and entertaining, and for a first impression this game made a great one.The further you get from this core gameplay though, the bleaker things start to look.Your hero levels up by defeating enemies and surviving waves (or rather, having the crystal survive waves. Your hero just respawns if he/she dies), and gets a skill point or two to invest into either personal statistics like health or damage or choose to increase similar values on their summoned defences. This means that you have to choose how to balance things between your hero and your defences.Higher levels will also unlock access to better (randomly generated, typical RPG fare) loot, new defences and 2 special skills.Spare mana from levels, which is there used to summon, repair and upgrade defences, heal the player and use special skills, is given to the player and is then used to buy items from the shop in the tavern (hub level) or upgrade existing items. Both of these take a ton of mana, far more than you'll get just by progressing through the game normally. You'll need to grind a lot to afford your first pet, or max out even the shoddy level 1 gloves you're likely to have picked up during the opening level.Then there are 25 pieces of DLC for this game, total value ~5x times the cost of the base game that add new levels, new costumes and new heroes (some actually new ones but mostly gender-swapped reskins of the original 4 classes).There are three modes of playing this game, locally, online using the Steam system and 'Ranked' using Trendy's own in-house system. Ranked is the only way to earn achievements, and is completely separate from the rest of the game (characters, campaign progress, even camera settings) which pretty much negates all the neat Steam workshop stuff that's out there since everybody is playing Ranked instead.I first bought and played this game on XBox Live Arcade, which was almost entirely neglected by the development team. Not only did they not get most of the DLC, they were also passed over on actual game updates, including patches and bug fixes. For example, to this day the first Apprentice tower has a hard cap on its firing speed that makes it utterly useless for higher level players.More recently a semi-sequel came out, Dungeon Defenders Eternity, which repackaged all of the original content into a shiny new package... and expected people to just buy it again. Worse yet, that game has since been abandoned and just half-heartedly (and looking at the community comments, also just incompletely) compensated the disappointed players by giving them a free copy of Dungeon Defenders.I don't normally bother with things like that in a review, but their business practices really are abysmal, and the game would need to be a hell of a lot better for me to excuse them.So now there's an Early Access sequel in the works, which looks to add even more weird design choices and problems and I'm just done with all of it.Whatever is going wrong at Trendy Entertainment is going very wrong and I recommend everybody that will listen to watch it from a safe distance and not buy their games, including this one.Maybe get Defender's Quest instead, since that's also a tower defence rpg hybrid and it's actually good			"

												This game is awesome. If you haven't already bought it or played it, do it. I picked it up for $5 (with all DLC, aw yeah) and I can see myself putting hundreds of hours into it. If you get stuck, you could even join the group ""DDFreeRunsByRequest"" to help you out and get you on your feet. What are you waiting for?			"

												Dungeon Defenders is by far the best game I have ever played. The game perfectly mixes tower defense and fighting.Pros: Great strategy gameRequires being attentive and is challengingAmazing community. So many people are willing to help out newer playersFinally being updated againCons:Kind of repetive build. In end game, you use 1 strategy which can still be fun to figure out on your ownRequires all DLC to get the most out of itBroken mob pathways on a few mapsOverall, it is very enjoyable and is one of the only games I have ever put more than a hundred hours into. I have recommended it to all of my friends and so far most have enjoyed it. If you're considering buying it, I would definitely recommend buying the collectors addition as well as the Tinkerer's DLC.  "

												After playing it for quite some time, the game is extremely simple, addicting and fun. It does look like Orcs Must Die 2 but this tower defense game is even better which is geared more towards multiplayer. The good thing about this game is that it has a good community. It's good because the players are nice and easy to approach when you ask them questions. Next, the game also has easy controls, basically it's like a 1-2-3. For the equipment, they all look the same from top to bottom except for the weapons. What I liked more about this game is that, the artwork. It takes so much creativity in order to create something like this from the monsters, towers, achievements and such.The only bad thing about this game is that I didn't really liked the mod which is in open/local It really does spoil the game, although you're not forced to use them in the game. So If you're buying this game make sure you start playing on ranked online and not on local/open.A must have game. 9/10			"

												Initially when I saw the cutsy graphics I thought this was like a kids version of Sanctum :) but there is more depth & challenge found here. Surviving a level needs cooperation with team mates & strategy especially in harder levels.Extensive looting, character customisation & upgradability along with an awesome mix of character classes all with their unique talents keeps you engaged in & out of the action... & speaking of action there are some intense moments! Its like tower defense mixed with Diablo style RPG elements, topped off with some old school Gauntlet style multiplayer action.Good fun, keeps you coming back for more!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

 Not a game you'd want to play alone! Dungeon Defenders is an amazing multiplayer game that combines  both  Tower Defense and Action RPG. The game itself is amazing, good graphics, pets, 12 classes (4 Base classes, 8 DLC's), and a good storyline. After you finish the campaign, the challenges that you unlock are really fun, their like minigames. As a bonus, the ~20+ DLC's for the game make the challenges endless. Suggestions if you buy the game.  - Play with a friend!- Controller, ( not required but preferred )- Start with the character: Apprentice- Have fun!			"

												This game is the reason why I got Steam.Or really into PC gaming in general.After playing a little over 400 hours, I've done everything. I've killed the snowmen, I've spent afk hours sitting in a solo lobby farming coal, I've gotten everything.And then I got bored.In the beginning, this game was gold. It was the f***ing greatest game in my 11 year old mind. Then someone gave me a hacked weapon, and the game changed.So, I started hacking myself. The game got a lot funner, now that I had the ability to do whatever I wanted. I boosted people up, leveled them up, finished the game Nightmare Hardcore with random people, because I thought I was being nice.Eh, then the plague of being bored came again.One day I booted it up, just to see my trophies, and have my pride of an 11 year old. Turns out, It didn't boot up.I was banned.After being banned for hacking, I started to care less. But, because of the nastolgia, I decided to try my hardest to get unbanned, in case any friends would want to play with me. Long story short, I got unbanned. *wow, it's magic*I left the community for a good year, and came back to finish another 100 hours, then to leave it for good.But, now it's abandoned. Entirely. One person on a open server, 4 people on afk shops, hoping to get some mana for some items they farmed 30 seconds for.So, this is Dungeon Defenders now. I wish the Devs didn't abandon it. But, it was a good game for it's run. I still want to boot it up every so often, then someone calls me to play CS:GO.I would recommend it. Or would have about 3 years ago. If you can get some friends, and no one hacks, it's fun. It'll provide some good 500 hours, like it did for me. Just don't be an idiot, and remember: It's all about the game.			"

												This is a great game, and you can pick it up very cheaply in sales thesedays. It's tactical enough, but also has the hack-and-slash to keep you occupied and stop you getting bored. It has a bit of replayability, depending on what you are in to. It only has a limited number of maps (20?), and very limited storyline, but you can go back at higher level modes or farm to get better equipment for yourself.On the downside, it suffers from the MMO problem of requiring friends to be levelled up at the same time, otherwise you will struggle to be useful in each others games, as due to the power curve one of you will be almost useless while the other can 1-shot everything.

												I thought this game might possibly have some sort of potential before I played it and it had so many positive reviews I thought I couldn't really go wrong. All I learned was that the game doesn't really have much depth to it and how I couldn't understand why it had so many good reviews. The graphics are nice and colorful but the character models themselves look sort of ugly. Each class has their own unique sort of defenses though there are things I really don't understand about the game. One being some of the dlc characters, you've got some that are just the same characters that were already in the game except different gender... I didn't think the other dlc characters were that good either, the jester just lays ''presents'' around which are just random defenses, there's also the robot character which I thought was ok but the berserker might be the worst, he gets no defenses, he's just a melee oriented character and the best thing about this game is setting up your defenses while the melee is incredibly simplistic and not very good. The melee mostly revolves around holding down left click. Some people complain about the grinding but grinding wouldn't be bad if it were actually fun, in this game it isn't because of how repetitive it is and also when u make a character u can see the defenses u'll be able to use if u reach a certain level and there's five or so of them. I thought ''ok, so maybe new defenses will become available to me the longer I play'' but I was dead wrong, u use the same 5 the entire game and u can get to a rly high level above 60 I think so that's all that time grinding with the same 5 defenses the whole time, a severe lack in customization. I was expecting a good game but in the end I was disappointed. You also shouldn't bother with this game at all unless you have friends that are willing to play since this game is incredibly boring in single player and lots of random people whom you try to join will kick you out for no reason.

												This game is good while you dont hit the 'mythical floor', where you need to grind for good mythical gear to be able to grind transcendent gear to be able to grind supreme and ultimate gear. This grind could be fine for someone, until you discover that all good gear is probably hacked even on ranked steam server. All top results for every map is hacked, crazy gear is hacked/duped, cubes is massively duped, mana is hacked. Any 10 year kid's pc knowledge is enough to make mana infinite, to make insane items, etc. This game could be good if u just isolate yourself from rest of the hacked world, maybe with your friends, and just play from scratch till 70-s. Then the grind part starts, which is very-very VERY boring. You have to waste 2-3 hours to beat survival level to be able to find some mythical gear to be able to beat tavern defense level to be able to level so you can grind new levels to be able to grind...Achievements system is fine, it makes at least a little bit point to grind levels and gear, but nothing else.Graphics is a mess, cell-shading outlines looks like piece of shiТ (basically looks like LoL, which is also piece of shiТ, but even worse), massive special effects make your head sick, area of effect weapons is just impossible to watch. I just switch my monitor to white and black mode sometimes to play this game. Yeah. Its really, really sucks. If your pet hits with elemental damage, or your weapon is area of effect hit, you just cant see anything sometimes because of this explosions of whatever effect is. DLC-s is complete p2w madness. Half of them is absolutely required for beating game on nightmare difficulty (which is locked by the way, you need another DLC set to unlock it).Eternia shards DLC set costs the most and the most important part of DLC's. Without it the nightmare mode is locked, the only place you can start grind some nice gear and experience. Absolutely required.Series EV hero DLC is so overpowered that she can just do levels on insane difficulty from level one. Tower buff is completely overpowered and REQUIRED to any levels on nightmare. Summoner uses completely separate defense units which is called summon units, and has pretty overpowered defenses too, that also is required later. You CAN_NOT beat almost any levels on nightmare without this two heroes. Barbarian is one of the top dps heroes in game and he is required for some of the hardest maps in game to take down boss quickly. Jester is pretty weak compared to ev or summoner, but she still can be pretty op builder and good ranged dps hero. Also move tower ability sometimes helps. Tavern defense (anniversary pack DLC i believe?) is required for leveling and has insane pet as reward for beating it on a nightmare survival. EV lab is required for getting massive amount of insane accessories that you... get ready... CAN NOT GET ANYWHERE IN THE GAME EXCEPT ON THIS DLC, surprise! Also, it gives insane ultimate weapons on regular basis, crazy stats armor, lots of trans armor, sometimes even ult++ armor. New heroes DLC is required because this female hero versions have more movements speed so they are pretty much standard for builder hero. Talay mining complex DLC gives insane rewards for survival again (pet rock i believe?).Some Christmas map DLC gives you coal for beating it, which i believe if u have 100 of them (grinded or ... duped again), you can combine them to get the most insane pet in the game (all this pets is hacked if u find any for trade). I hope you get the point. If you want to really grind this game and spend lots of time on it, this P2W DLC is absolutely required. I dont recommend this game for almost everyone. However, if you and your friends desperate to find any co-op game to play, you might try this. Wait for sale and take your chances.			"

												Although several years old, and followed by one sequel (Dungeon Defenders 2) and one re-imagining (Dungeon Defeners Eternity), the original Dungeon Defenders is still a ton of fun.  While it can be played solo, the real fun of this game is playing co-op with at least one other person, and coordinating your defenses.  A long and grindy game, to be sure, but plenty of fun on the journey.  A very tongue in cheek art style, as well as pop culture references everywhere: on some maps, the reward for completion is a Monk staff that looks like Darth Mauls' double-light sabre, while on another, you get a chainsword right out of Warhammer 40K.On sale the entire collection, including DLCs, will run you about $10, which when you see how many hours you'll sink into it, is a huge value.

So I'll make this quick.Good character customization, strong variety of playstyles even inside the classes, and very satisfying when you beat the crap out of concert tickets lines of enemies. This game is good if you like this genre, maybe try Eternity if you're not that serious about the genre. DONT BE FOOLED BY ETERNITY's PROMISE OF DLC!!  Seriously though, get this game, and you won't regret it.   p.s. Wait for the sale, they come oftenEDIT: Trendy has confirmed that Eternity has been abandoned, and have even sent players who already bought Eternity copies of THIS GAME. I rest my case.			"

												While i had not played for many years its coming back fast why i both enjoy and not enjoy the game.I have multiple characters, diffrent towers and abilitys where my Countess has the highest stats at a mer 3.5K Attack.The problem with this game is if i play this game online Multi player, i find people with 6K stats who want to do all the builds and tell me how to play... And i realise after they don't want to acctually play the game with me, they just want to farm awesome loot, and me being their makes it easier for them to farm Ultimate good stuff.To enjoy this game alone, you need to feel a bit of pressure to build something quickly and do it well. I find Summoner on the first waves of any mode is the best way to go since 360 area of sight.While my Countess (Slightly better then Squire) places Harpoon's in new and stratigic locations in which i just have high hope the towers with DESTROY all OGRES!Then i have no mana and get my NMHCDefender out and defend against the toughest enemys and become a defense of all weakspots i have, where the crystal may get damaged.I highly recommend this game, just don't force yourself to do Tinkers Lab on NMHC Assult pack unless you got HIGH Stats on your assult dude. You need to run, and kill EVERYTHING! And if you die and restart it's not fun and becomes dull.To get the best expirence out of the game farming from the easiest to hardest levels looking for the best Armor and Weapons you can find to make you progress further into DD's NMHC and NMHCMM. If you don't know what NMHC or NMHCMM is, you'd probably want to play the game. MM is a extra challange on its on been Mixed Mode.I raised my Stat's 500+ on Health, Damage and lost that on Range but done +300 on Rate of fire.This was a proud monment since i used about 8 Billion Mana or more to upgrade my newest Leather Armor set and gave it to my Countess. That was a awesome monment and to know i am gradually increasing her Specs to take on new difficult challanges i am proud!Not proud of other players doing everything and tell me to sit on the side lines, get the hell out of my party! Your a disgrace to the time i am putting into the game to improve my character's! I will farm with my controller instead then!Hope you enjoy the game as much as i do, and avoid things that are not fun, just pack up and leave that party and join yourself in a private and do HCNM Misty Mire and kill OGRES! :D			"

												LOVE THIS GAME! lots of replay value, ways to play. the dlc characters are worth the buy when its on offer. free new maps being released, the leveling system is awesome, as is the looting. the caracter variety is great with new ways to play, different strategys and takes on each level. admittedly once you get the setup that works well you dont really have to think much about it but then theres survival. higher waves means better loot and harder enemies. no more sitting around letting your turrets do their thing, you have to run around maintaining your defences and helping take out the hordes of enemies weakening each one. its amazing that you go from firing a balista cannon once every 7 seconds to 3 times a second and makes  you feel like a badass. between leveling, loot and upgrading said loot you can go from nothing to a god!!! i rank this game 100 out of 10!

												Dungeon Defenders is probably the BEST GAME EVUR!!! (probably not, but it's awesome, really)You are reading the review of someone who was able to play this game before the modders came and began their work of pure evil. If you don't have the DLCs you get to choose between the Archer, Monk, Apprentice and Squire.The archer-class focuses mainly on traps and, well, physical long-range attacks as she is an archer-class hero.The monk-class is balanced between long- and short-range attacks and can create auras (spheres) that have various effects on the enemies.The apprentice-class is a magic long-range fighter able to build magic towers and one type of blockade.The squire-class is the tank in this game as he has to fight in close-range combat and can summon various weapons that cause physical damage to nearby enemies.Most of the players tend to choose the ""Monk"" because of his balance, but you definitely miss out if you play only one hero-class. You get to know the advantage and disadvantages of every single hero and learn to combine them to master this game.Enough talk for now, go and hunt some goblins!!!			"

												This game is highly addicting and immensely fun. What puts this game over the top though is its online community. They are some of the most helpful, giving and reasonable people you'll ever meet online. If you've avoided online games in the past like I have, give this one a shot. It's well worth your time and effort.			"

												A coop 3rd person tower defence game. A great game to play with friends. Oodles of levels, a campaign, challenges, multiple classes to master, all genuinely unique. It has a lovely graphical style to it with a pleasing musical score.Since its release there has been a lot of dlc which you can usually pick up with the main game when the sales come around.Since the release of its sequel the masses have mostly moved on for its shinier newer version but dont let that put you off picking up this little gem, particularly if you know anyone into the genre to coop with.Just fun.

												This is a great bang-for-the-buck game that combines tower defense and first (or third) person shooter ideas into a fun little package. Worth catching while on sale. Fun to play with friends.The under-advertised feature of being able to do local drop-in and drop out co-op with up to four players is a GREAT feature... and one I didn't even know was possible until someone mentioned it in game. You can utilize this with both offline AND online play. It's also a great way to power-level your own characters! Have a big bad level 80+ and you want to get a different class up in level and gear quickly? Plug in a Xbox 360 or Xbox One controller, hit start, and let them idle on a hard map you've mastered a defense build for.... Maybe even slap a rubber band on the shoot button, and let the game's auto-targeting hit anything somewhat in front of your lowbie. (The game seems to auto-target assist with a control pad by default... though not with a mouse and keyboard.)The story isn't particularly great, though it is a nice touch. Once you figure out the ""trick,"" many of the maps are pretty easy (though figuring out the best way to utilize your limited points for building defenses is one of my favorite aspects of the game.)Unfortunately, there are points in the game where you will likely hit a gear curve, forcing you to repetatively grind a previously beaten map on increasingly harder difficulty settings to unlock better gear. Later levels and especially the expansion can be VERY challenging on ""nightmare"" difficulty. Or, you can look around at other player's shops and try to find some gear to buy. (Sadly, most players GROSSLY overprice the gear in their personal shops.)The ability to unlock and select difficulty levels for maps is a definate plus. The 6 hero types (I'm not counting the mostly the same gender ""alternatives"") allow for different approaches to the maps, though true master builders will learn to combine the tower / defense types to really clobber harder levels and higher difficulty settings (a small hint: BUFF BEAM).I spent a ton of time in this game and originally caught it a long time ago for like $5. It's been one the best game purchases I've made in terms of value alone. It's a pretty fun little game to boot. Go buy it already.			"

Updated ReviewAfter more than 6,000 hours in this game the day has come to quit Dungeon Defenders. Easy to imagine that I've given a recommendation before. Unfortunately recent updates made by the Community Development Team (CDT) ruined the game - at least for me.To my knowledge the CDT has been introduced to fix bugs, adding quality-of-life changes such as new content. Instead they also change core mechanics of the game such as RNG, towers and enemies. Things we were used for long 5 years are getting changed out of the sudden because certain individuals within the CDT are enforcing their changes more or less.Changes which results into non-working builds which worked for such a long time, changes which are not though-out well enough in regard to low and mediocre players. The exclusive focus to change things for high-end / meta players is a shame to say the least.The game has worked just fine for 5 years, players who are involved within the CDT have played the game themselves several thousands hours just fine. If the game needed such drastic changes, they all wouldn't have spent so much time in a ""bad"" game. Sadly a lot of them forget or ignore their past history within Dungeon Defenders.Fighting after every update to keep Trendy's Dungeon Defenders became extremely tiring over time. Discussing with people who have played a game several thousands of hours is somewhat pointless when they are still thinking that they have to progress in any form or shape. There is a point when you have completed a game, when you play a game because it does fun to play instead of trying to progress further.The RNG got changed due to requests of players who have played a lot of hundreds of hours. They wanted more higher quality drops for some reasons, even though Mythical and Transcendent quality was enough. Result: The categorization of drops were changed. While you have seen regularly Transcendent armor with 280 or more upgrades including good stats, now you are lucky to see a Transcendent armor piece with more than 200 upgrades. Most Transcendent stuff ends up with upgrades from 110 to 150. Also Supreme and Ultimate drops with upgrades from 180 to 200. Sadly people focus so much on quality tags that they completely ignore actual item stats. We are miles away from the drops we had before v8.1.Towers has been changed too. Unfortunately the CDT decided to start with a Hero which was already superior compared to all other beginner classes and made him more superior. The explanation was that they had to start somewhere. True, but not with current strongest! They also stated that every tower should become a viable choice, which sounds more like ""build-whatever-you-want"" considering the superior position of the Hero they started with since a ""nerf"" will be not discussed. I don't know about you but I belief that towers don't have to be useful across the game. If you pass a certain point it is good that you are in need to build different than you did on previous difficulties.Enemy mechanics has been changed. Golden enemies have received a massive boost across the board. Instead of a 15% in health and strength they received a boost of 500%! People already disagreed to this while the beta was out for testing but concerns were completely ignored. Now we experience broken builds which worked so long for campaign and especially for survival. If you had to fight a golden Wyvern with 9.2m before, you are facing now Wyvern which are dealing 5 times more damage while having 40m health. Since they don't really interact with your defenses, they fly straight forward to your crystal. For high-end / meta players not a big deal but for every mediocre player. The ones of you who played with lower stats back in the days will remember sudden crystal explosions caused by golden enemies.All this results into one important thing; Reaching high-end / meta status has been made more difficult.Last but not least, many changes has been performed which will encourage and make the life of hackers easier. I'm talking about changes like allowing to build into spawns, higher survival starting waves (almost no legit player is able to deal with), adding new maps and NM achievements behind a ""grind""-wall.I would have preferred when the CDT concentrated on bugfixes and new content. My interest in this game was huge, hence all the guides, tips and tricks I've provided. Too bad.Original ReviewRecommended with an agreement of ~80% (~250 of 200 found this useful)At first I was not interested into this game so I purchased it for my brother. Played once I had to purchase it for myself. I never have played an more addictive game, though I like the Tower Defense genre a lot. I don't think I need to write much more about the game due to my playtime of this game.If you like Tower Defense then you have to play this game. It is frequently on sale so keep an eye at the stores of Steam, GMG, Humble Bundle and others.Note: Be aware that the Linux and Mac version of this game has a few issues. I strongly advise to play it on a windows machine.			"

												Combine an action hack and slash fantasy game with a tower defense game that lets you place towers anywhere. DD has had its ups, its downs, its ostritch like developers denying criticism. I Honestly still think this is a fun game.Sadly the community is mostly gone, but the game is still solid. Pick this up on sale or in a humble bundle if that ever happens again. "

												Belated review. Dungeon Defenders is one of the best action-tower defense games I have played. The gameplay is much like other games in the genre - progress through a series of levels in which your goal is to defend a crystal. The catch is the crystal is under attack by waves of enemies. Between waves you have the opportunity to set up defenses (different types are available depending on which of the 4 characters you use). Once a wave starts, it's you and your defense versus the horde... rinse and repeat. So what sets DD apart? Well, one cool thing is that you create and play as a personalized character that can be saved. Your character levels up via experience gained and can be equipped with hundreds of different weapons that are found during levels. Add in an excellent online co-op mode, tons of extra challenges and DLC, and you've got a damn near perfect package. Give this a shot, even if you've never tried tower defense before... but don't blame me if you become addicted! :)			"

												Endless grind, and unstable. The DLC fills holes that were otherwise unfillable in game play, in some cases forcing you to buy the extra characters to begin to even attempt some of the endurance games. (Example: Summoner) I say unstable because you can log numerous hours, fight up to higher levels, and one day, login to find that your heros have been whipped out entirely.  Also, Forget much cross platform play, If you're on the linux client, forget playing with Windows Users, even locally. However, it is a good time sink for when you just want to zone out and play something. It scratches an itch.			"

												Dungeon Defenders consumed 2 years of my gaming life - it is an insidiously addictive game. It's my 4th favourite game of all time. Great levels and satisfying tower building/action gameplay with some epic battles at higher difficulties. If you are going for the 100% then at its core is some cruel grinding required for leveling and mana (money) farming. Best enjoyed with co-op buddies. "

It still manages to be fun on your own though. It's fantastic, really. All the characters are unique and none of them play the same at all. The music is great, the art style is fun and the gameplay is tops, I really can't think of anything wrong with it off the top of my head. It's a steal at whatever price it is, and even more if it's on sale.

It's a first person shooter tower defense game, that is well rounded and features RPG elements.  during my time with the game I had a tremendous amount of fun.  A sense of repetitiveness is felt at times, but that is part of the charm.  There is a large variability on how you can play and how you can win.  I highly recommend this game.			"

												It's good. Would be an even more fun game if it could be played as intended. Instead, you have all manner of hackers and cheats running rampant on the Ranked servers (the Open servers don't even pretend to enforce the rules) to the point that you literally can't have a game without someone tainted by illegitimate play joining, be it someone who hacks or has been given items/mana by someone who does.In addition, individual hosts can kick (read: ban) players from their game at any time, which they can and will do frequently and without warning, reason, or provocation. You can reasonably expect to be kicked from games multiple times per play session, and never know why.That said, both issues do not exist if you play primarily solo, with friends, or as a host. It's a pretty solid game that is still supported by a dev team, has community events on a regular basis, and generally pretty fun to play. There are a large variety of maps, heroes, and ways to play. Early, mid, and late game progression all play completely differently from one another, and they're all worth experiencing in my opinion.I've been told the DLC system is not great, but I personally picked it up with all DLC from the Humble Bundle, so I honestly couldn't tell you with any degree of certainty what things are available without DLC. Many maps and the Nightmare difficulty require DLC to start from your own Tavern, but can be played without owning the DLC. All of the most recent updates (and at this point, presumably all future updates) are all free, with all heroes besides the base four being DLC.			"

												I'm here to finally write my review on this game, as I have started to play it again after a substantial amount of time away. To be quite blunt, the game plays fairly well, and progress is fairly linear throughout the main maps of the game, however, that is where the hand-holding stops. Upon finally defeating your big, friendly, final boss and the basic challenges, those who bought the DLC are in for a pleasant treat of hours upon hours of grinding. Don't get me wrong, this is actually a good thing; you are forced to take your old strategies and constantly improve them to conquer nightmare mode, and you will reap the reward for this effort, but this, while to me being a fun grind, may be to others, simply dull. This is where I talk about the community of Dungeon Defenders; there are still many high level players who are friendly enough to help out newer players to get started, be it early game, or nightmare mode, they are there. That being said, this community is still very friendly, and most of them will be there to help you out if you ask for it. All in all, I'll rate this game positive, with my long, dull review. There have been many changes since the community took over development that I dislike, and balance issues are nowhere near being addressed in an orderly fashion, but the feel this game brought me from day one still remains, and that is what truly matters to me.

												Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of HearingWith regard to accessibility for deaf/hoh gamers, I give Dungeon Defenders an 8/10.GameplayThere appear to be visual cues to most (if not all) events in the game. The screen does get very cluttered, though, and it can become easy to miss a key visual such as your crystal being attacked, which can lead to losing a game. This event is accompanied by a sound for HOH gamers.Subtitles/TextDungeon Defenders has a storyline that plays in cutscenes. When you turn captions on, the cutscenes will be the only time that you see the subtitles, as the gameplay does not require them.Chatting/CommunicatingDungeon Defenders has voice chat. In my experience so far, most people do not seem to use it, though, and prefer to type. There are no key combinations or voice binds to convey messages quickly, so you will need to type if you cannot hear/speak.			"

												I highly enjoy and recommend this game. It is not just your average defense oriented game. Especially when playing by yourself it gets to be pretty challenging to where everyone is coming from everywhere and you can only be at one place at a time. Its fun, addictive, strategical, and just awesome. It is definitely worth the 15$. I would recommend it to anyone that likes a little challenge, or even a lot of challenge. There is such a variety of everything that is available. Every class is different in the play style and uses. Every class is going to have a different set up of blockade/towers. The designs are very well done and the level designs are fantastic. The laning is very simple, but still requires thought in where to put towers and blockades along the way. One thing I do have to say about this that never really is established with info, Steam Achievements are only availible by doing the Trendy Ranked servers. You will not be able to earn them on Local play or Open play. I realized that after getting some in game achievements and not getting any Steam achievements.			"

												Dungeon Defenders is a co-op focused tower defense game where four heroes try to stop huge monster waves from destroying magic crystals by building all kinds of defensive structures such as walls and cannons. There are also some roleplaying and hack & slash elements so players can level up their heroes and fight enemies with swords and spells. The singleplayer side of the game is lacking but the multiplayer mode is always very fun and addicting. Technically the game is quite polished and doesn't have any fatal bugs which is always a good thing.			"

												I've played this game for 47 hours in the past week I've had it. That should tell you how much I adore it. A great Tower-Defense style game with a bunch of different characters, tower styles, and gameplay-styles to choose from, and an enjoyable story to go with it. The only real gripes I have are that there's no high end level cap (You can prevent someone lower level than you from joining) so a level 80 can join your level 20 game at any time and try to carry. You can kick them, of course, but it would be nice to prevent that. The other is that there aren't many players these days. You can fix that though. Why don't you go ahead and buy the game? Add to the population.			"

												The original play through (Medium) is frustrating as the controls and mechanics take a little bit of getting used to, but once you adjust the second play through (Hard or Insane) is typically pretty enjoyable; even if the treadmill at the end of the game to attempt to play through Nightmare difficulty is entirely too long.It's a popular game, which is good because the only way it's enjoyable is playing with others.

												A thinly-veiled loot grind. As a co-op game, it's fun and mindless. But as an actual strategy game, it's very poor. If you like loot grinds, you may adore this game, because it delivers trivially-incremental weapon and armor upgrades for hours and hours. But if you're the type of person who recognizes a time-suck for what it is, you will run out of entertainment in this title after about 4 hours of each character class you try.Also, the UI is awful. The best combination seems to be: gameplay with KBM, and manage your character and inventory with a controller. But neither is perfect. Gameplay with KBM works pretty well, especially once you learn the hotkeys, but all text and menus are blown up HUGE on screen, obscuring the game ... a hallmark of a mediocre port from the land of consoles.Proceed with low expectations.

Local Co-Op (or Lan, or playing with people you personally know online) I can definately recommend. Me and my wife and some of my friends head over to my house to play this as a couch co-op game all the time and its a butt tonne of fun. My wife ussually doesn't play video games ""unless you can raise a baby in them"" (sims, harvest moon, pokemon (yeah I don't get that last one either)) and she loves playing this game with me.All in all, not a terrible game.

This game fits all of my gaming needs! I love tower defence RPG, MMO, and just Multiplayer on it's own, kind of games. I have had this game for a long time now, and I think that over the years it has improved a lot! in a good way. The tech support is amazing, and fast, the gamers are about 3 out of 4 % nice! and super interactive, over all this game has filled a lot of open time i seem to always have, and thats with school, my social life, my boyfriend, and even my little minecraft server! this game has really amazed me, even to the point where i wanna see more! more out of it and more ""DLC's"" and ect. Anyway I just wanted to show how much i really like this game, and I hope that you guys at ""Trendy Entertainment"" keep up the great work! Us gamers love what you guys are doing over there! Thanks.

												Let's see if I can put my thoughts together on this...When I first heard about Dungeon Defenders I was incredibly excited. I've loved Tower Defense games for a while and always been a fan of Co-Op games. So when I heard there was a Co-Op Tower Defense RPG coming out I couldn't wait! Once my friends and I got our hands on it we had a blast. Sure it had some problems... Squires were OP, Survival was too easy, ranged enemies would attack behind the spawn shield... but it was really fun! Eventually the first part of their  expansion  came out, that's when things went downhill.Trendy decided to add a new difficulty level in their expansion, since players thought the game was too easy. On ""Nightmare"" difficulty Player/Tower stats were altered to make the game more  balanced . A new item tier ""Mythical"" was added for Nightmare, presumably to incentivize playing it. Which sounds good until you find out Mythical items had massively inflated stats, trivialising past content. Though to be fair, getting said gear incredibly difficult. Drop rates on Mythical were very low on all but the hardest maps. Seeing how those maps were balanced around you having Mythical gear, pretty much the only way to get the gear was to join someone who was hardcore and farmed early maps for it or was also carried.Did I forget to mention they added new enemies for Nightmare? The Spider was the first one they added. Having a new set of (invisible) spawn locations, chosen to backdoor common defense locations, they would web towers drastically reducing fire rate and increasing the damage they would take.  Thankfully  spiders would prioritize players, webbing them and reducing movement speed, attack rate as well as preventing the use of abilities. Djinn were the second ones added, flying enemies that have the ability to ""instantly"" destroy defenses with a cast time based on what tier the defense was. Also possesing the ability to buff enemy units, turning them gold and making them significantly stronger. Sharken were the third, having the ability to charge through defenses pushing them out of the way. Probably the least obnoxious of the new enemies. Lastly the Goblin Copter, flying enemies that would spawn from Wyvern spawn locations. They would spawn carrying an Ogre and proceed to fly somewhere on the map and drop them off. If you made the mistake of not killing it before then, it would proceed to fire player seeking missiles, anti-tower flares and rockets at players/defenses. They also made Ogres much more common on Nightmare, in case all the previous wasn't enough.Trendy, confident in their new found balance, proceeded to add new maps with this in mind. Basically having the difficulty options be varying differences of Nightmare difficulty, new enemies included. Most of the maps they added were well designed (some not so much). Unfortunately to play these maps you have to own them (shocker). To be fair, Trendy had this odd business model of having (most) maps be free the first two weeks after their release. Now a days you have to buy them and there are A LOT of them.They also added some new classes, Barbarian for pure melee DPS, Series EV able to wield two ranged weapons and use an  adjustable  wall and a buff beam, Summoner for pure builders with  movable  towers and Jester for pure ranged DPS and minor trolling. Though the first classes they added were gender swapped versions of the vanilla heroes, with slightly different abilities. All of these you had to pay for as well, though I'd say they're all worth it (excluding the gender swaps).Overall, Trendy hit gold with this game and did a pretty good job at keeping it alive. Personally I don't like what Nightmare did to the game but I think they had a lot of good ideas. Dungeon Defenders is definitely a game worth playing, if you haven't for some reason. Just make sure you get some friends to play it with and don't expect to play all the maps unless you're REALLY into it. DLC strongly recommended.Also Trendy seems to have granted a community team the ability to officially update the game, so maybe we'll see some cool stuff out of that.			"

It has a wide range of characters, a huge loot system, and an awesome tavern where your achievements are turned into all sizes of trophies! I would highly reccomend this game, even all the dlc!

We already bought the game, why is the dev releasing too many DLCs instead of just updating the game? I know I'm a bit demanding but I'm not the only players disturbed by the DLCs.			"

												Simply one of the best tower defense games I've ever played.  I really like the fact that you can level up either your character, towers, or both...though you share points between the two categories so you'll need to consider what kind of character you'd like to be.  Speaking of which, the game has four main characters plus plenty more via DLC (each of which has unique towers and abilities.  If you enjoyed ""Orcs Must Die"" and ""Sanctum"", then this is a no-brainer.

												#ENGLISHAwesome tower defense game! I've spent hours and days in this game and still I'm not on maximum level and with the best EQ. Don't worry about too much DLCs. If you have friend who have these maps he can host for you and you can play together! Also you can make all achievements without DLCs! That's awesome! If you have friends who have this game play together and help each other! It's endless FUN! I would recommend this game to you!#CZECHÚžasná tower defense pařba na které jsem strávil hodiny a dny a stále nejsem na maximu svého vybavení. Hodně DLC? Vůbec nevadí. DLC mapy jsou Vám přístupné pokud je Váš kamarád hostuje. Což je skvělá věc! Další velké plus mají u mě achievementy. Můžete je získat všechny bez jakéhékoliv DLC a relativně snadno (samozřejmě musíte mít dobré postavy nebo kamarády co budou stavět). Tuto hru můžu velmi doporučit!			"

												This game was probably the most value for money purchase I have ever made. I have sunk countless hours into this game (I lied.. steam counted 737..) and it has provided me with hours of fun, a great community and a lot of interesting gameplay. The game itself is a 3rd person tower defence game with an rpg element to it. Your hero levels up and gets new items that drop from the monsters you kill. The loot is randomly generated which in itself has a good and a bad side. The good side being BAJILLIONS of armor/weapon variants. The down side is that getting good quality loot and more importantly loot that you need and are looking for is very difficult, especially when you get to the higher rarity armor and weapon types. This can make the game very grindy and if doing levels over and over again, perfecting your layout and gameplan isn't for you then Dungeon Defenders isn't for you, at least not if you want to be the very best like no one ever was..That being said there are a lot of levels, challenges, maps and various modes to play giving the game enough variety and interesting gameplay to warrent anyone playing it for the price. There are some big flaws with the game. The prime of these boil down to two things; There is a lot of DLC, and I do mean a lot of it, and the game is very easy to hack. Now the DLC aspect of the game isn't too terrible. There is a lot of it but a lot of it is cosmetic and almost all of them are cheap. Now the hacking is an actual problem. The game is very easy to hack and hence hackers are prominent in the community, even in the online play. Trendy tries to monitor and ban hackers but it is a bit out of their control. If you are the kind of person who likes to play by themselves (which you totally can) then this won't affect you at all. If you want to play online with others then I suggest using the forums and getting to know a few people who play the game (or get your friends to play with you). Having people you regularly play with ensures a nicer experience then trying to adapt to pub games and risk having your experience ruined by hackers. With all this in mind I still feel like Dungeon Defenders was a great purchase and a great experience. I would recommend it to anyone if for nothing else just to play through the story and see the interesting gameplay it provides. This game is old however and the sequal is on its way so perhaps holding off for that may be a better idea if you don't plan on getting into this game hardcore.			"

												If you want to slay wave after endless wave of enemies while defending your precious jewel/base then hit up some MvM on tf2If you prefer MMO grinding, leveling up, and playing a game in which everyone outclasses you by the same absurd length you'd expect from someone who's been playing the game since it first came out then this is for you. Hark, there is a steam workshop entry that will give you a wave full of squishy high exp enemies, propelling you from level 1 to the maximum level cap in a single round. What would normally take months of nonstop playing can be done in a mere thirty minutes.			"

The maps are also very diverse and look beautiful on best res. But don't get the game if you dont have people to play with. Other wise if you have people to play with then get the game it is totally worth 15$ dollars.			"

												Too good to be true for that price. Everyone that has steam SHOULD have this game. It deserves the indy game of the year, seriously. This game offers more than a full retail game. BUY IT. features Challenges(game modes), over 10 missions which some can take up over 45 minutes, mini bosses, bosses, difficulties, PVP, trade system, customisation, etc.Like tower defenses, action or RPG games? get this. GET IT.Listen to the ''Dev Diary 1'' video on the steam store page, it says everything.Overall: 9.5/10-----ON A SECOND OPINION, MONTHS AFTER THE GAME GOT RELEASED-------This game is a dlc ♥♥♥♥fest which the DLCs costs more than the game. it went from awesome challenging tower defense rpg to a pointless grinding and they ♥♥♥♥ed up the game from what it used to be.Overall: 7/10(it's still good and there's still hundred of hours of investments in this game)			"

												OH MY GOODNESS I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!You have a choice of four classes at the beginning, Squire, Apprentice, Monk, and Huntress.- The Squire is mainly melee- the Apprentice can lay down offensive defenses- the Monk has ranged and melee attacks, but weak defenses, making him harder to play- and the Huntress has a powerful ranged attack, but less defensesIt's really fun to go through mowing down enemies, and that brings me to my next point, enemy variation.Enemies come in about 12 different types, such as goblins, elf archers, orcs, ogres, wizards, and so on. But, each enemies can also have an element assigned to it, so it deals that element's damage, and is invicible to that element. It adds more strategy to leveling up you weapon, instead of putting all of the points into fire. Also, each enemies can be assigned a difficulty, such as easy, medium, or hard, which increase health and damage.The leveling system is great. You have ten base stats. TEN. They are split up into hero stats, defense boosts, and abilities. Hero stats include Health, Damage, Speed, and Casting Rate, which increase your heroes killing potential. Defense Boosts are like the hero stats, but for your defenses, so you can increase fire rate, health, damage, and area of effect. Abilities you unlock later in the game, but you can assign stats points to those to increase damage.I don't want to spoil the story, so I'll just go to my next point.This game is one of the few current-gen games to get DLC right. No doubt. You can use DLC to buy new hero classes, which shake up the gameplay, new map packs, and even an extension to the story. But all of this is optional. You don't have to buy any of it. You can still enjoy the full game for the price you see on Steam.There is no doubt that this is one of my favorite games of all time.			"

												If you had any doubts about this game, Leave them at the door. This game may not seem like much, But it takes a new twist of gameplay. Combing action RPG combat with Tower Defence Stratagy. After I sat down and played it for an extended peroid of time I fell in love with this game. To put it simply. There are so many weapons, armors and pets it's not even funny. 4 player co-op campain (and in some cases 6) the game isn't too story driven but it does have a nice story. Unlike a normal tower defence game you take control over your hero during the combat phase and fight enemys in real time, Be in over the shoulder third-person, First person or eagle eye view it satisfies it all. This game gets a 10/10 from me. I do reccomend it do anyone.			"

												This game was my first venture into the Tower Defence genre. It's really addictive with huge replay value. Use one or several character to lay down defences against wave after wave of increasing enemies. Much fun is to be had tinkering with the builds to maximise efficiency of slaughter. Great fun to play with friends as well.			"

												It's a mix between hack n slash and tower defence, and it works amazingly well. The four classes of hero compliment each other making for excellently strategic multiplayer, while the ability to swap out the character during a game allows you to experience the same fun in solo play too. Plenty of challenges and a campaign to work your way through, and of course all the collectible loot to keep you going.			"

												A strong and diverse tower defense game with a RPG twist in the form of leveling and gear, Dungeon Defenders is a solid experience for the money. The story is your typical fantasy trope, but it’s hardly impedes play enough to bog you down. The small stable of characters is diverse with each class engaged in their own building with powers and towers, injecting an interesting amount of variety (and strategy) to each of the colorful levels. The game is littered with achievements and rewards to earn from each successful completed area. The Inn as a home base for all of your trophies is a spectacular touch, adding a virtual boasting for the competitor in us all. There are a few drawbacks, though. The online element is your typical mixed bag with instances alternating between super awesome to loathsomely awful; a strong set of online friends will improve your experience.  The endgame numbers grind is another flaw that hits the fun factor like a ton of metaphoric bricks, but by the time you get to that point, you’ve well gotten your money’s worth. Overall, Dungeon Defenders is a quaint tower defense game with enough fresh angles to make it worth the journey.			"

												Dungeon Defenders is a good game, but don't let the cute graphics fool you.It's a tower defence, hack-n-slash, first person shooter, role playing game or TDHnSFPSRPG. Like most tower defence games, the main goal of the game is to not let the enemies get to what you're trying to protect, in this case, the Eternia Crystals. Towers, walls, traps, machines, and auras keep the enemies from advancing, but that's not the only element of gameplay which is essential. Your character itself will also see more direct combat with foes using a wide variety of melee weapons, staves, spears, bows, and guns. Not to mention a large assortment of pets to boost your towers, buff your stats, or just beat your enemies up.Each class has its own strengths, weaknesses, towers, and skills. Stats can be assigned to focus on hero damage, tower damage, or a hybrid depending on how you want to play. Items are random and even pre-set ones always have random stats.There's a free demo. Why not give it a try?			"

												For the initial price, Dungeon Defenders (DD) provided way more value for your money than most games.  If they had stopped there, the game would have been insanely popular.But they started releasing tons of 'tweaks' that changed things by (usually) 30-40%.  Changes on such a scale are a bad idea, and quickly unbalanced everything.  Months later, the changes now seem to be fairly stable...  If it weren't for all the DLC.See, the DLC tends to add further unbalancing changes.  And the cycle continues, over and over.Buy this game for the original content, and try not to be disturbed by the changes.  It's immensely fun.And if you buy the DLC, expect it to be horribly unbalanced.Also, bring friends, or play solo.  PUGs in this game are the worst ever.			"

Gameplay is fun and entertaining online aswel as on your own with many new challenge maps to the standard story lines. Replayable maps with gratuitus amounts of wepons and armor that can be upgraded aswel as pets. When you find new stuff you can even put the old items and spares into a shop of your own to sell.Many good qualitys to this game but been a multiplayer game can have its odd bad player.90% dragon approval !

												Dungeon Defenders will cater to fans of Tower Defense style games as well as those who fancy RPGs... the RPG aspect of this game makes it more fun and in depth than other TD games I have played. You collect currency, buy items, upgrade your hero, upgrade your towers, and even get a pet. It's a very colorful game with cartoonish graphics which creates a fun environment that will attract a larger demographic of gamers. Overall its a solid game with some entertaining gameplay and good extras.			"

												Dungeon Defenders is a mix of an action hack'n'slash and a tower defense game. You pick a class you think you might like to level and upgrade to move on to higher level and stronger things. The game has a decent bit of replayability, but can get a bit repetitive at times. I would rate this game a 8.5/10 because I feel like it could have been better in certain areas. (The Game is still amazing as is.)			"

												I am so glad they added mouse freelook support for the pc. Steam version probably has the best exclusives, giving you 4 familiars which have op unique abilities. The game itself allows for very different style/gameplay depending on which character you choose. The Melee characters are probably the easiest to start off with since your strongest attack is your melee weapon and don't need to worry too much about mana. The ranged characters need to worry about keeping up their traps/spells/buildings but once you plan out your attacks you will know how to place things correctly and can basically keep out of battle while your buildings/traps do all the work for you.

You can choose from 4 different classes, every class has different style of playing, so if you play in four together with every type of class, you will kill every evil monster trying to destroy your powerful crystal!  In this game, you can also customize your weapons, pets etc. So if you like style of tower defense, join this amazing game and play with your friends!btw, user-made maps, dlc, new characters etc. are coming soon.

												This is possibly one of the best co-op games I have ever played. It's a fantastic multiplayer hybrid of tower defense and third-person hack-n-slash. The game is very easy to pick up, yet has so many little nuances that you'll never quite feel like you've mastered it.Multiplayer functions flawlessly, even cross-platform. Graphically, the game is gorgeous. Unlike so many other DOTA style games, this one doesn't have a stupid ""pay to win"" or microtransaction scheme. There's a lot of DLC available, but it's reasonably priced and doesn't necessarily give you a huge advantage ingame - just a different way to play or some different maps to play.If you like tower defense, get this game. If you like third-person hack-n-slashes, get this game. If you like both, get this game, make your friends get this game, and buy some DLC. It will not disappoint.			"

												Okay, never did get around to writing a review for this, so I'm gonna make this short and brief.This game...is a 10/10. If you never played Dungeon Defenders before, play this one before Dungeon Defenders Eternity. Dungeon Defenders Eternity disgraces everything about the original. They tried to fix alot of stuff that wasn't broke, and broke a game that was quite good to begin with.It's true, this had alot of hackers cause it was too easily hacked (dunno WHY people have to ruin such a great game, what is so fun about hacking!? Nothing...), and though Dungeon Defenders Eternity solved the issue of making the game hard to hack, they ended up changing alot of other aspects based on the first Dungeon Defenders which saddens me to the extreme.Otherwise, this game is good, this game is great, this game is a gem among gems that no one should hate. Highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone of all ages. Great story, excellent gameplay, full of replayability, will still play this game.			"

												A strong and diverse tower defense game with a RPG twist in the form of leveling and gear, Dungeon Defenders is a solid experience for the money. The story is your typical fantasy trope, but it’s hardly impedes play enough to bog you down. The small stable of characters is diverse with each class engaged in their own building with powers and towers, injecting an interesting amount of variety (and strategy) to each of the colorful levels. The game is littered with achievements and rewards to earn from each successful completed area. The Inn as a home base for all of your trophies is a spectacular touch, adding a virtual boasting for the competitor in us all. There are a few drawbacks, though. The online element is your typical mixed bag with instances alternating between super awesome to loathsomely awful; a strong set of online friends will improve your experience.  The endgame numbers grind is another flaw that hits the fun factor like a ton of metaphoric bricks, but by the time you get to that point, you’ve well gotten your money’s worth. Overall, Dungeon Defenders is a quaint tower defense game with enough fresh angles to make it worth the journey.			"

												I love this game. Fun to play alone, or with others. I just wish more people got online and played!! Most people online are nice. A lot of kids, but that is expected. I noticed it's hard to join low level people's games with a high level character. Which is why more people need to play this game for a variety of players. I host games often because of gettiing kicked, and allow all level characters to join most of the time.  Personally, I think modified weapons are great if you want to breeze threw the maps or have a more relazing experience. I would not recommend always playing with these modified weapons, because it takes away from the excitement of this colorful and sometimes challenging game. Challenge games are fun... and well, challenging. I recommend playing on hard once you get the hang of the game, because it's the right amount of difficulty and enemies in my opinion. I love playing on Insane, but I've put a lot of hours in this small addicting game. I play started out playing with keyboard and mouse, but i like to use a controller now. Using a controller is easier once you figure out how to build towers. I recommend this game, but be careful not to get sucked in and spend a bunch of money. I hear it's very easy to do.			"

												This game is SUPERB, measure your intelligent from how you combine your heroes speciality to defence to crystal wave by wave. Next wave the enemies are more stronger! All depend on your equipment and stratergies. Here the enjoy part, u can interact with other player for trade and business purpose to get better equipment normally. There several level of fun in this game:Noob/New: enjoy killing and making own layout.Normal: u now know totally the gameply and start leveling your heroes and enjoy the storyProfesional: now u know master all the map,now seeking to max level 100 and acquire better gearsEntreproner: u already have extreme gears,now u collecting for business purpose(in game only)Collector: u have everything people want, u looking for super rare item.No life: u complete something impossible to be complete, have all the super stuff.Personal advice, this game is awesome but really need passion to reach the next level.and kinda waste alot of time if u loooking for rare item.therefore i give90% let me play MOM!!

												Steam made me do it. That aside, Dungeon Defenders is one of my favorite games of 2011. Loads of content at a bargain price of $15 (and it's on sale all the time too). Fun gameplay, good loot mechanics and top-notch split-screen/online support. Excellent post-launch DLC support to keep the core content strong alongside the full UDK toolkit for expansive modding possibilities.An essential purchase for any action-RPG or tower defense fan.

												When i play Dungeon Defenders i notice that the AI is relly well done, all the mechanics in the game(the building part/equippment part) is also done really well.The leveling system is also very nice, as you level up the enemies get stronger and give more XP, evening it all out.The Online function is all evened out, the enemies get stronger the more people in one game.The game is not to hard eiter, it has a togglable auto aim kind of feature, this makes the game easyer and more enjoyable.Overall it is a grate game to play whit your friends, and singleplayer.

												Dungeon Defenders is one of the most rarest genres I enjoy playing, since most tower defense games dont offer to play a 3rd person hero, and there are even multiple choices for that. Other thing which I liked are the players, they are always helpful to newbies (not all players) but most of them do. The map choice is also nice, and I enjoy spending my time on this game!10/10 Recommend it!			"

												Great Game... Constant New Content...Need Anything Else?Best way I can describe it is that a 3rd person shooter and a tower defense game mixed into one amazing game. You set up defense towers, while you also run around and kill goblins yourself. Each class has their own towers/traps and weapons, a variety team makes the difference. Solo this game is ok, but playing with people online or, better yet, your friends makes this one game I can't stop playing. So much DLC it gets costly to get it all, but it is money well spent on a game like this.Pros:+Game-play+Group play+A lot of new content (now that DD2 is coming out, I expect it to stop adding to this game)+Many characters and missions+Level designs+Can set up a shop to sell equipment and pets+Lots of AchievementsCons:-Solo play-Can get repetitive at times (especially playing solo)-There can be glitches (goblin stuck in wall and mage hiding in door for example, however game will kill them after a couple minutes)So-So:=Graphics (they are good, but not amazing)			"

												Well, I originally wrote a review recommending the game to people, but the game has essentially become a giant 1,000 hour farmfest to even be able to get into any of the newer maps within the game. The original concept was amazing and well put together, but Nightmare on newer maps is a neverending raise to get your specific classes to have just the right stats to be able to scrape through by the skin of your teeth. It's not going to be a pleasant or rewarding experience at this point.Updates upon updates intended to just prolong the life of the game without adding anything meaningful to it really ruined the appeal for most players. I found myself spending less time playing the game as a result of this and don't really like the fact that there are maps I consistently farmed a while ago being completely impossible because of new additions to the game; these are maps I was able to do on the difficulty that have been reworked by simply dropping giant ogres on top of my defenses. That's not difficulty, that's just adding stuff for the sake of adding stuff and making things more difficult just to try to get people to continue playing the game.Too many games are going this route at this point. When it is just an endless grind, only the most dedicated are going to stay and they are not going to be happy. DD was definitely a great game, but if you're looking for something that is completely enjoyable and rewarding, don't get this game. That is, unless you're OK with playing the original version of the game. That is actually enjoyable and requires some thought in how you handle certain things. It's enjoyable.			"

												Too good to be true for that price. Everyone that has steam SHOULD have this game. It deserves the indy game of the year, seriously. This game offers more than a full retail game. BUY IT. features Challenges(game modes), over 10 missions which some can take up over 45 minutes, mini bosses, bosses, difficulties, PVP, trade system, customisation, etc.Like tower defenses, action or RPG games? get this. GET IT.Listen to the ''Dev Diary 1'' video on the steam store page, it says everything.Overall: 9.5/10-----ON A SECOND OPINION, MONTHS AFTER THE GAME GOT RELEASED-------This game is a dlc ♥♥♥♥fest which the DLCs costs more than the game. it went from awesome challenging tower defense rpg to a pointless grinding and they ♥♥♥♥ed up the game from what it used to be.Overall: 7/10(it's still good and there's still hundred of hours of investments in this game)			"

												Like a lil bit of the dungeon crawl? Like some tower defense? well this game just might be for you. Its a hybrid crawler/tower defense (more in the tower defense side).Your the tower pretty much and you gotta set up some defenses and use your character to attack the mobs coming at you while defending. It has different modes in it, one being pvp,pets which you can collect which help you and lvl up,and tons of different weapons for each character that mostly have different stats. A fun game to pick up when on sale or at full price. You can even play all the dlc content as long as the person hosting has the maps.			"

												Okay, never did get around to writing a review for this, so I'm gonna make this short and brief.This game...is a 10/10. If you never played Dungeon Defenders before, play this one before Dungeon Defenders Eternity. Dungeon Defenders Eternity disgraces everything about the original. They tried to fix alot of stuff that wasn't broke, and broke a game that was quite good to begin with.It's true, this had alot of hackers cause it was too easily hacked (dunno WHY people have to ruin such a great game, what is so fun about hacking!? Nothing...), and though Dungeon Defenders Eternity solved the issue of making the game hard to hack, they ended up changing alot of other aspects based on the first Dungeon Defenders which saddens me to the extreme.Otherwise, this game is good, this game is great, this game is a gem among gems that no one should hate. Highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone of all ages. Great story, excellent gameplay, full of replayability, will still play this game.			"

												This is possibly one of the best co-op games I have ever played. It's a fantastic multiplayer hybrid of tower defense and third-person hack-n-slash. The game is very easy to pick up, yet has so many little nuances that you'll never quite feel like you've mastered it.Multiplayer functions flawlessly, even cross-platform. Graphically, the game is gorgeous. Unlike so many other DOTA style games, this one doesn't have a stupid ""pay to win"" or microtransaction scheme. There's a lot of DLC available, but it's reasonably priced and doesn't necessarily give you a huge advantage ingame - just a different way to play or some different maps to play.If you like tower defense, get this game. If you like third-person hack-n-slashes, get this game. If you like both, get this game, make your friends get this game, and buy some DLC. It will not disappoint.			"

												Dungeon defenders is a good game for all those Tower Defence fans. Mixing 1st - 3rd person shooting to placeing towers, traps and buffs with one of the uniqe 4 classes. Gameplay is fun and entertaining online aswel as on your own with many new challenge maps to the standard story lines. Replayable maps with gratuitus amounts of wepons and armor that can be upgraded aswel as pets. When you find new stuff you can even put the old items and spares into a shop of your own to sell.Many good qualitys to this game but been a multiplayer game can have its odd bad player.90% dragon approval !

												This is a pretty nice blend of tower defense and action-RPG. If you have a craving to farm for good loot, there's plenty of it to be had with this game. The biggest drawback I've found is the difficulty curve. Easy, Medium, Hard and Insane are easy enough to do through the core campaign but if you want to tackle Nightmare, you'll have to do a lot of farming for much better equipment as well as grinding experience to get to a level where you can actually equip such gear, otherwise you'll end up being a burden to your team in the ""endgame"" maps. If you get into it, be sure to get some friends down the road because it can get pretty boring playing solo. Overall, I find it to be a pretty enjoyable and addicting game and I'm glad I picked it up on the cheap thanks to the Humble Bundle!			"

												BOYCOTT TRENDY, BOYCOTT F2P, BOYCOTT EARLY ACCESS, BOYCOTT EARLY ACCESS!!Don't be fooled into buying any of trendy's work as they have ruined the dungeon defenders name, they took the second game, charged for it early access, only to release it free to play. With microtransactions to boot. Terrible terrible business move, don't buy this game or any of their games until they stop being a part of the issue with PC gaming these days.ORIGINAL REVIEW:""Dungeon defenders is a great co-op game. The gameplay is tight, and fun. The graphics sound, leveling system, and weapons are great. If you have a group of 4 players it can be really awesome, but even with 2 or 3 players this game is great. This game does the tower defense genre justice, I do feel however that the character styles are a bit recycled. Some characters are simply the same style as the base characters just with different skins. Highly recommended!""			"

												Dungeon Defenders - Your everyday tower defense game.There is a very big reason why I recommend this game - It is possibly the only game that my wife and I can play together without going at each other throats.The background (story - if you can even call it that) is quite simple. The heroes go away for blood and glory, leaving the apprentices behind. As any proper apprentice does, they messed up and now hordes of orcs are invading you from every corner to destroy the Eternia Cristals and unleash a new latent evil).So long story short - you have a cristal and you have to defend it at all cost.The positives:+ Very fluid game+ Different Classes with unique traps and tricks+ Nice cartoonish characters+ Smooth Learning curve+ Can be amazingly challenging, depending on how you play it+ Nice to play with friends and familyThe negatives- Can be repetitive (after 60h of game I am still loving it, but I can understand why people would say that)- Very segmented in DLCs. It is frustrating when you realize that you only have 50% of the game, and the other 50% is in DLCs.- Playing on-line with strangers is not very fun. Strangers dont tend to play as a team and the game becomes more a race to see who plants more of their own traps. Furthermore, higher levels will have no trouble outshining the lower level players.My personal experience:I have 2 characters - one in which I have been using to play alone (full single player, without even mixing classes) and other that I use to play with my wife.My experience as single player - From what I read - and from what I believe it is the way the game was built to be played, when going single - you should use several characters and combine their traps in the most efficient way. Personally speaking, I have found extremely fun and challeging only using one character and its own abilities/traps. And trust me - it is hard, challenging, and sometimes it even seems impossible.When I am playing with my wife - we often spend time discussing where and when to place traps in the latter maps, and we are already working as a well oiled machine in the maps that we know better. We have been able to evolve characters +\- at the same time, and it is nice to see that even though we use different classes, we both feel that our roles as individuals and as a team are important to beat the level. I feel that evolving the characters at a simillar rate has helped improving the fun of the game. If you have a couple of close friends that commit to level their characters at the same pace as you guys, everybody will feel important during game play and everybody will draw the most fun of it.Just a personal opinion, but this is a game I would definitaly recommend, either if you are playing single or multi with close friends.

												OH MY GOODNESS I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!You have a choice of four classes at the beginning, Squire, Apprentice, Monk, and Huntress.- The Squire is mainly melee- the Apprentice can lay down offensive defenses- the Monk has ranged and melee attacks, but weak defenses, making him harder to play- and the Huntress has a powerful ranged attack, but less defensesIt's really fun to go through mowing down enemies, and that brings me to my next point, enemy variation.Enemies come in about 12 different types, such as goblins, elf archers, orcs, ogres, wizards, and so on. But, each enemies can also have an element assigned to it, so it deals that element's damage, and is invicible to that element. It adds more strategy to leveling up you weapon, instead of putting all of the points into fire. Also, each enemies can be assigned a difficulty, such as easy, medium, or hard, which increase health and damage.The leveling system is great. You have ten base stats. TEN. They are split up into hero stats, defense boosts, and abilities. Hero stats include Health, Damage, Speed, and Casting Rate, which increase your heroes killing potential. Defense Boosts are like the hero stats, but for your defenses, so you can increase fire rate, health, damage, and area of effect. Abilities you unlock later in the game, but you can assign stats points to those to increase damage.I don't want to spoil the story, so I'll just go to my next point.This game is one of the few current-gen games to get DLC right. No doubt. You can use DLC to buy new hero classes, which shake up the gameplay, new map packs, and even an extension to the story. But all of this is optional. You don't have to buy any of it. You can still enjoy the full game for the price you see on Steam.There is no doubt that this is one of my favorite games of all time.			"

												Yep, aware this game is almost 3 years old:)) But I'm gonna write a review anyway! Dungeon Defenders is a choice game:) Recommend? Certainly yes. If hybrid hack and slash /tower defense is your thing then this is for you. If its not, get it any way. You'll still have a blast, especially if you play with mates. I, and everyone I have played with, have had a lot of fun with this game. The following is a list of what I consider pros, cons, and things I am on the fence about . Pros being things i liked (of course), cons being things that annoy me, and 'on the fence' being things that are kinda  'hmmm...yeah, mehh' but not enough to sway my opinion of the game. And yes, my opinion is subjective:) Here we go: Pros:* Multiple characters to choose from with distinct abilities. Allows for a variety of play styles. You'll find a character who has a play style that you like and feel 'at home' with.* Frequent character 'level ups'. Creates a good sense of character progression and hey,  we all love becoming more awesome:) *'Level Ups' are well balanced. 'Level ups' on both equipment and characters feel like they are a real choice that impacts your play. But not game changing enough that you 'gimp' your characters with one poor choice.* Insane number of loot drops. Even with multiple characters, no one is ever stuck for equipment.*Four player co-op...c'mon, who doesn't love that?!!*Local split-screen co-op.  Local co-op is a feature that is missing from way too many game nowadays. Its awesome to have this feature available.*Levels have a nice varitey of design layouts, encouraging you to employ different strategies. You'll find tactics that work for you no matter what level you are on, but you don't feel like you do the exact same thing for every level.* Awesome amount of DLC for those who want to keep the game going a bit longer:)*Being able to change which of your characters you use ingame enables you to play solo if you want to, and you never feel like you are stuck without the defenses you might need.*Controller support. Having a choice to use controller or keyboard and mouse is great. Both have strong groups of supporters, and its great to have the option that suits your preference.Cons:* Rather 'busy' visuals. Hellooo cataracts:)) (kidding). But, the very bright colors, and numbers and icons that constantly appear on screen can be a bit much on the eyes for some. I got used to it, but at first i wasn't sure i ever would. * enemies have variety, but they lack character. It's hard to pinpoint why i feel this way, because I think it stems from a combination of things.  I hesitate to compare games in a review, but the humorous commentary and cocky swagger of the orcs in Orcs Must Die [by Robot Entertainment] gave the enemies a degree of life that is missing from the enemies in Dungeon Defenders. Also, the slower pacing of the enemies can make you feel like they don't have a sense of urgency. I never really felt that they wanted to destroy that crystal more than anything else in the world. On the fence:* Kinda slow pacing. I know I brought up the pacing thing in the cons regarding enemy character, but this element of the pacing regards a different aspect of the game. Everything, from your character to the enemies, seems to plod along quite dreamily. For new players, this can be great, so you have time to react. For more experienced gamers it can be a little frustrating at times.  I can imagine some people dumping loads of 'level up' points into their character just to get him or her to run around a little faster:)* Local co-op players share loot and currency. For some, its a true chance to cooperate, or it creates a friendly rivalry for cash, and for others a frustrating race to see who can spend the cash to level up weapons and armor first. It depends on who you play with:)) Choose your allies wisely:)* Story line is almost nonexistent and ultimately irrelevent. Yeah, if you want the story to pull you in and care about the ingame world and the related characters, this game is not for you.* Cartoony artstyle. Sometimes i like it and other times i wish it was a bit more...mature.There we go, thats it. These are my thoughts on Dungeon Defenders. So, if after all these years you are still having trouble deciding whether you want to play it...I hope this review helps.Cheers! "

												I've played this for a bit, both single-player and multi.  Beat the campaign, started another char class to do it again, discovered that your solo chars can't be used multiplayer for some reason, started over again, got bored, etc.  It's a fine little action TD game, nothing seriously wrong with it.  I'm just not sure a game like that needs randomized loot drops and crafting and all this other stuff.  There's also a disappointing lack of variety in enemies.  By the time you get a few levels in (and there are a decent number of those), you've pretty much seen everything that's on offer.  The extra classes are good, but I don't think they differentiate from each other enough.  Plus, each one has only a handful of different towers you can make..			"

You can choose from 4 different classes, every class has different style of playing, so if you play in four together with every type of class, you will kill every evil monster trying to destroy your powerful crystal!  In this game, you can also customize your weapons, pets etc. So if you like style of tower defense, join this amazing game and play with your friends!btw, user-made maps, dlc, new characters etc. are coming soon.

												This game is really fun and you can play as heaps of differnet characters through DLC but you only begin with 4.you can play online or offline, co-op or pvp really whatever you want.You have to realise though that this game is nowhere near as good if you dont get a couple or all of the dlcs that just add to the fun.You must also remember that you are able to get hacked weapons but they are really cheaty and just ruin the game.apart from that this game has heaps of different game modes, maps and is just the best tower defense game ive ever played.

												Great Combination of ideas in this game.  Tower Defense, Hack & Slash, and Looting!  It's a good party game if you have a group of 3 friends to play the game with.  Playing online with a PUG generally doesn't go quite as well and can easily destroy what makes this game fun ""Teamwork"".  You really need to work as a team to beat the harder difficulties or just level your character up high enough to solo everything yourself which would be time consuming and boring for all but the really bored or dedicated folks out there.No real downsides except it can become tiresome after playing throught the whole campaign twice.  Add-ons help keep the game interesting though.  As long as the DLC keeps coming.9 / 10			"

												It is a very nice aspect the game has approached with a 3rd person tower defence game: which really stood out to me, I like being able to walk between my defences and see how they interact with each other.I was able to collect loot at my own pace, grinding isn't as much of a bore as some other games and can actually be fun when in a party. Another key aspect of the game is leveling up different statistics of your defences in four different ways: being Map Difficulty,  Character Stats and abilities and gear that you and your party can equip and obviously leveling up the towers themselves. The maps are very well made with barely any bugs that can be abused and the maps all have a couple nice challenge counterparts that give you more of a challenge, variety and better gear. Nice variety of characters to choose from each with their own unique play styles, abilities and specialties and when combined with other classes via coop or just switching out your character mid rounds give you the necessary boost in possibilities.Would definitely recommend to someone new to tower defences and anyone one else really. 8.5/10			"

It is also very fun to level up and increase your DPS as you upgrade your weapons and your player and you get better drops. overall it is a fun game and I would recomend it to people who are looking for a game that doesn't take a long time to get the hang of but will have you playing for hours			"

												Well, I originally wrote a review recommending the game to people, but the game has essentially become a giant 1,000 hour farmfest to even be able to get into any of the newer maps within the game. The original concept was amazing and well put together, but Nightmare on newer maps is a neverending raise to get your specific classes to have just the right stats to be able to scrape through by the skin of your teeth. It's not going to be a pleasant or rewarding experience at this point.Updates upon updates intended to just prolong the life of the game without adding anything meaningful to it really ruined the appeal for most players. I found myself spending less time playing the game as a result of this and don't really like the fact that there are maps I consistently farmed a while ago being completely impossible because of new additions to the game; these are maps I was able to do on the difficulty that have been reworked by simply dropping giant ogres on top of my defenses. That's not difficulty, that's just adding stuff for the sake of adding stuff and making things more difficult just to try to get people to continue playing the game.Too many games are going this route at this point. When it is just an endless grind, only the most dedicated are going to stay and they are not going to be happy. DD was definitely a great game, but if you're looking for something that is completely enjoyable and rewarding, don't get this game. That is, unless you're OK with playing the original version of the game. That is actually enjoyable and requires some thought in how you handle certain things. It's enjoyable.			"

												Did you just ask me To recommend the Game? Okay! Dungeon defender Its a long endless game and if you like any tower defence games that are RPGs or PvP well my good friend this game will be the right choice for you. You and the random community(Or they might become your friend if ya lucky enough.) must defend the Enternia Crystals and if you defeat the Whole Campain on Nightmare Hardcore you will get a achievement and a very Special Reward. There are bosses and to get Nightmare you need to get the 4 dlcs Lost Eternia shards Part 1-4 which is fun Each last wave will have a boss in it and if you defeat all Shards map on the same difficulty you will unlock the final bosses map! Crystalline Dimension. You can get all these for £39.99 which is a good price. The Summoner will not use DU (Also known as Defense units) But he will use MU (Also Known as Minion Units) that will allow you to spawn Crystal enemys but they will not attack you but they will defend!

It is a really fun and addictive third person tower defense game, (you can change it to first person if you really want to!) and I've never really seen one before this. There are 4 heroes on the base game that you can play as that gives the game a lot of replay value. There are a lot more if you get the DLC.

												Great strategy game really! It's super fun to play :)As you go into the game you are greeted by a nice introduction to the story. Basically the story is about 4 children left to tend the castle by their parents while they go off. One of the young ones breaks a crystal which releases 'The Old One' or the great evil. Your mission would be to protect the crystals from evil creeps by building towers or by using your weapons and amazing skills to fight them off. The journey wont be easy, so you would want to grab a friend or make one in the game.You will join the game and create a character. It is recommended to create on Ranked as there are less people who mod weapons on there. If you didn't buy any DLC then you would start off with the 4 main classes which are Squire, Apprentice, Huntress and Monk. In the time I played this game I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed the great community which comes along with it and some great gameplay. I'll try not to be bias but it's hard to when you are literally in love with the game.If you like strategy, tower defense, leveling up your charactes, grabbing loot, selling, trading then this game might be just for you. It contains a pretty good storyline which drags you in to see what happens next and some great DLC. The downside is that it takes a long time to become powerful enough to complete alot harder challenges as in all leveling and loot games. It will take time to find good loot and some runs to do so. One wont be enough, you will need to do more as you will probably need to equip all of your characters as with one it will be hard.			"

												A fun, colourful, action packed fantasy tower defense. Co-operative gaming at its finest. Play this before Dungeon Defenders 2 is released to get a feel for the game. This is essentially a 3rd person tower defense. You utilise your classes unique towers to defend your teams Crystals on maps arranged in a campaign fashion. Cooperation is the key to success. Combining every class' unique towers makes for the best defense against waves. The replayability of the game is there, however it is as interesting as you are willing to let it be. Once you hit level 70 the game becomes a grind fest, hitting away at hardest difficulty maps (with the potential to fail and get nothing much) loses its fizz later on. "

												This game right here! This is probably one of the most enjoyable game I have ever played in years. A friend got the four pack and introduced me to it. Didn't think much of it at first, but after a couple hours of playing I found myself suddenly hooked. The tower defense and having your own character walking around whacking and killing stuff is really fast paced. DON'T however buy DD Eternity!!!!! It is essentially just a ""remake"" of DD with cross platform servers. What could be so bad about it you say, well lets just say that it is a LAGG fest and you are better off buying Dungeon Defenders 2. Nuff said.			"

												Massively addictive game! This game will likely have you totally absorbed into the fun and strategic world of DD. If you like hack 'n slash, and/or tower defence, then you will absolutely love this game.08/05/2014 EDIT:Dungeon Defenders isn't quite what it used to be, as amazing as it is. What I mean is, the community isn't the same. I'm sure there'll be plenty to disagree, but various times I've tried for games, I've come up with very few. It's a shame, but I suppose all good things must come to an end, at least for me.I have some excellent memories of this game, and even with the online situation being somewhat less than it was, I still absolutely recommend it. The vast trading, all the trophies, enormous amount of gear to collect, the sheer amount of tactics and co-operation, ... there's just too much for me to possibly encapsulate in a few paragraphs of text.I don't play this game anymore, ... I don't really play much of anything anymore, but I do remember--just about--a few things that were negatives about this game:1. The community could sometimes be a bit harsh, but there were also more than enough friendly, helpful players, at least in my experience. Trading could be rough, but it was fun and rewarding, once I figured it all out.2. Unfortunately, there were quite a few hacked items floating around, which was an incredibly disheartening thing for me. I was disgusted when I ""got"" my very first hacked sword, ... I was completely oblivious, thinking it was just really cool, ... although my Spidey senses were tingling, I guess I just didn't want to believe it, until people happily pointed it out. I dumped the sword and was quite peed off. Still, I didn't find it to be TOO excessive, such as in Torchlight II, in which I just found no sense of achievement, amongst people that are basically God. I like to share my accomplishments and yes, I can be competative, so cheaters with online games like this are a negative for me.3. Performance, even on a powerful rig, was a problem, pretty much down to the game itself, not a hardware thing. Still, the game runs well, the last few times I launched it and tested split-screen on King's Game, something that used to lag like a ♥♥♥♥♥. I'm quite pleased with the performance, nowadays, but I still think it's not very good, I guess I just got used to it. An oversight worth, ... looking over.If it's still anything like I remember, and it's your kind of genre, then definitely get it.NOTE: I'd avoid this game like the plague, if you only have Linux, as it simply doesn't work properly on it. Google ""can't collect gems on Dungeon Defenders Linux"" or something to that effect, and you'll see why it's basically unplayable.If you have any questions, feel free to ask. It has been a long time, but I still remember bits and pieces.			"

 Dungeon Defenders 8.7/10 Unlike Dungeon Defenders 2, Dungeon Defenders is a completly different game. It's the core of what the Dungeon Defenders community enjoys. It had nice DLCs of new unique maps and characters, a challenging difficulty meter and much more. I really enjoyed this game, even when owning high level characters I still can't beat some of the difficulties.Keep in mind DD can get boring without all the DLCs and friends to play with. If you plan on playing solo you can, but when playing with friends it gets even better. The only issues you'll run into is a lack of multiplayer servers, since this is an old game and not much are playing it anymore. Another downfall is in multiplayer, some players have lv 120 characters that can win the maps for you. I don't recomment playing or opening a lobby for high level players to beat the game for you as it's more fun doing it yourself.Overall DD is a great game, try it out.			"

												A really addicting game, despite it´s slightly grind-heavy content especially in late-game this game is incredibly fun when plaing with Friends and other people, every character is unique in stats and has their own gameplay (The 4 counter-gender heroes in the dlc are identical in their turrets, but different in their scaling, so a.e. is a female monk better suited when she builds the Auras, rather than the male monk, who deals more weaponry damage.) the dlc´s give a lot of bonus-content like new enemies in the Eternia shards dlc´s, or new unique weaponry! All in all a great game!			"

												It's basicly a well done defense/strategy and action hybrid.I love this game, You should give it a try! It has loads of content and is best playedwith friends and people over the internet.They have added so much add-ons to the game since launch, almost too much. (all cost money)And they have also updated the game increadebly much since launch with free content and modifications. It also has support for mods.			"

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is a Tower defence strategy game.Interface/Menu/SettingsAble to play with your controller.Able to customise the controls on the keyboard.You are able to choose your own screen resolution size.Able to play fullscreen or windowed mode.There is a music volume slidebar available.There is a sound volume slidebar available.There is a mic voice volume slidebar available. including PUSH TO TALK.You can play online or offline. Local or single player.About the game.This is a pretty unique tower defence game. You are able to play with your own hero and build towers. You can focus entirely on a character or only on towers. The heroes are able to level up and they will keep their levels too throughout the game. You are able to upgrade and find weapons/pets to make them stronger. There are many different heroes with their own advantage and disadvantage. But you do have to defend the core. If a core is destroyed, you will lose the game. I do recommend to play online only with your friends. Because sometime there will be a dude messing it up. Or you get kicked instantly or sooner or later from a server.Has a story!Has survival mode.Has alot of difficulty Levels.Able to make a Level scaling lobby.Upgradeable equipment/Towers and pets.Music is extremely good!Alot of different levels/Pets and heroes!Is really addictive.Really great graphics and sceneries.Other things.-------------------I Give this game a 9/10			"

												Well here goes my first review on Steam. What a good choice of a game too. At the time of this review I have only played for 34 hours but I can tell you I have yet to even scratch the surface.Some key points I tell my friends when we play this game is depending on your character you'll have a whole different play style. Thus increasing replay value because you'll want to go back and play as new people with different defences and strategies. In fact, I want to finish this review up so I can go back and continue playing. If you get the regular verison you'll have a blast, but I can't express how much content the collector's edition truly has and for only $10 during steam sales, that's the way to go.Anyways Happy Gaming. I'd give this game a thumbs up and a high recommendation. A solid 9/10.			"

												First Bought this game on the PS3 and enjoyed it totally, but found out that the mods were pretty much only on PC so I decided to get a copy on the PC and don't regret it. Picking it up on sale on the humble store is a must to get all the dlc in one package. Now for the gameplay it is a tower defense that can be easy or hard depending on how you make it. Life is always easier with friends, but it doesn't mean you can't play solo easily because the game allows you to switch heroes mid wave and make use of all you heroes towers albeit having separate mana pools.There is one downside I encountered immediately when I started playing though and it was the TrendyNet feature that while cool I didn't choose to start playing multiplayer until I had already created a character locally meaning I had to create an entirely new one. Also you have to be connected to Trendynet to obtain the steam achievements which is a problem too. This is all solved by private games on the Trendynet server though.Despite these little things I do enjoy the game's fantastic design that keeps you in the action at all times trying to support your towers whether through repairs or a carefully placed blast of magic.Overall I do enjoy this game myself and am a fan of the tower defense genre so I recommend it to anyone else who likes them and wants to boost their collection.

												This was amazingly fun with a full group of 4 people when I first started it.  Very fun way to handle the tower defense genre.  There is your standard mage with towers, but also interesting ideas like monk with damage/debuff bubbles, archer using traps for support type defense, and a tanky type knight using walls and ballista.  You can increase either your obstacles' effectiveness, your actual hero effectiveness, or a mix of the two.It got too difficult to keep up with much of the harder content without getting some amazing gear, which was only obtainable very briefly via some hardcore exploitation.  By the time we got to that point in the content, there was no legit way to get the gear yourself without trading for exorbitant prices.  Was fun while it lasted, and definitely worth some time just to get through the original/non-DLC part of the game to level up and try it out.  Even more so if you've got a group of buddies.  Have not played in a long time so some of the negative aspects may already be addressed by now, but at this point I'm not likely to return.			"

												First i need to mention,that Dungeon Defenders I is more Popular than Dungeon Defenders Eternity,more than double amount of Players.Second i need to mention that the best Game in the Genre is Orcs must Die 2.But Dungeon Defenders has a RPG System,it has 4 Player Coop,it has more Classes with own Abbilites,thats what makes it intresting even if you already have Orcs must Die 2.The Maps get real Challenging and specialy with the DLC Classes Teamwork is rewarded.For example there is one class able to summon Minions like Archers.When a Squire and a Summoner works together,the Summoner can summon Archers on Advantage Points,only accessible by small stairs,and the Squire then can set a Barricade on that Stairs,making the Barricade and the Archer more worthfull then they would be on their own.The Game also has loot and Item Drops.There is a all time around the clock player Amount of around 600,you always quick find a Game,also for low level or even Starter Heroes,no Problem.I wrote this Review November 2014Check out my Youtube Page where i do first Impressions of Games in a Amateur-Version of Total Biscuit (that means i do the serious Aproach not the funny Aproach like for example AngryJoe)The Stoned Videogame Nerd			"

												Do NOT buy this game.The game on it's own is fun enough, if you have friends with the same number of expansion packs,. but without all the expansions (an extra 50,- E to pay for each player) you will not stand a chance at ever seeing end-game. Also, you'll most likely be kicked by other players from any and all public games.The company is a total money grabbing studio, releasing tons of tiny useless DLC packs as well as larger ones you need to stay ""active"" and have a shot at competing. Most public games are just created where 1 player does all the building, and you are told to shut up and do DPS or get the ♥♥♥♥ out.Do NOT buy this game.All things aside, the game is full of cheaters with godly stats ""millions"" of dps for each tower they place, and the game devs do nothing to stop it.What do you expect?

												Dungeon Defender is a very nice game it has 4 classes for usual, Apprentice, Squire, Huntress and Monk. Apprentice is a magic man, that uses towers that shoot magical energy and fire while his some defenses are floating magic shields. Squire is a sword type, that uses spiked barricades and Boucers to bouce enemy back from the crystals. Huntress is a stalking spotted leopard that can go invisble to the enemy eye and set down trap like mines that detonate when enemys come in its blast range. Monk is an Aura man that uses Aura to defend the Eternia Crystals, like electric auras tat shock the enemys then they get inside of the aura and helpful auras like his Healing Aurato heal himself and his teammates. You also have a storage that is called your Heros Forge. Items alike armor and weapons are stored in there and you can sell these items from there to gain more money, or Mana, which is also used to build defenses(youll get it once you play it). There are also some funny referances like Light Saber from Star Wars:D. You can color the clothes of your Hero and name your Hero when you properly make them, but while in battle, you can quickly make anoher character with its name and color already done. You can also decorate your own crystal when you first play and you can change it by going to options i think at the main menu. This game is a very good game i really recommend this game and i hope more players play this game there is also a second one it is free right now if you want to play that too(though im not gonna have a summary there most likely xD). And i also recommend that you get the DLC to get even more characters like the summoner that can summon minions that will help you, and fyi they move.Made:6/28/2016 time 1:09        Thank you for reading this summary!!!

												Dungeon Defender is a very nice game it has 4 classes for usual, Apprentice, Squire, Huntress and Monk. Apprentice is a magic man, that uses towers that shoot magical energy and fire while his some defenses are floating magic shields. Squire is a sword type, that uses spiked barricades and Boucers to bouce enemy back from the crystals. Huntress is a stalking spotted leopard that can go invisble to the enemy eye and set down trap like mines that detonate when enemys come in its blast range. Monk is an Aura man that uses Aura to defend the Eternia Crystals, like electric auras tat shock the enemys then they get inside of the aura and helpful auras like his Healing Aurato heal himself and his teammates. You also have a storage that is called your Heros Forge. Items alike armor and weapons are stored in there and you can sell these items from there to gain more money, or Mana, which is also used to build defenses(youll get it once you play it). There are also some funny referances like Light Saber from Star Wars:D. You can color the clothes of your Hero and name your Hero when you properly make them, but while in battle, you can quickly make anoher character with its name and color already done. You can also decorate your own crystal when you first play and you can change it by going to options i think at the main menu. This game is a very good game i really recommend this game and i hope more players play this game there is also a second one it is free right now if you want to play that too(though im not gonna have a summary there most likely xD). And i also recommend that you get the DLC to get even more characters like the summoner that can summon minions that will help you, and fyi they move.Made:6/28/2016 time 1:09        Thank you for reading this summary!!!

												Dungeon defenders has been quite an experience and was one of the first games I really got into. It can be described as a blend of hack and slash loot collection with tower defense, such as the gift from heaven that was Bloons Tower Defense. In terms of how this blend plays out it allows the player to help out the towers during the attck waves meaning a much more immersive experience than other tower defense games. In tradition with games such as diablo there is also a heavy emphasis on randomized loot that can always be improved. This however can lead to some frustrating encounters as loot may drop with better stats, but have a level requirement of 60, at the start of the game. Gameplay plays out very smoothly with the transitions between the building and defending phases, allowing for a breather between the heavy onslaughts, letting you upgrade and repair your defenses as seen fit. The traditional defend the crystal game mode may start to get stale after doing many a mission but thats brings us to my favorite part of the game, the challenges. The challenges of the dungeon defenders are unque mission that put a twist on the workings of the game by changing how fundemental  parts of levels play out. This includes a crystal that teleports around the map, a level in which golbins rain from the sky, one where no towers are allowed, and dozens of others thanks to the large amount of free and paid for content that Dungeon Defenders has recieved post launch. Overall the game is a solid blend of two enjoyable genres that is pleasant romp through many varied environments. I highly reccomend playing with friends as it increases the enjoyment of the game exponentially.The game has taught me that all necromancers are jewish Jay Leno			"

												Dungeon Defenders adds a new twist to tower defense with a mishmash of RPG, action, and tower defense gameplay elements making for a worthwhile investment. There is plenty of content to keep players busy – whether it be working their way through the campaign and tackling challenges. It’s not with its setbacks, though, with the less-than-exciting combat system and loot that feels more like a chore than a reward system.Tower defense sits at the heart of Dungeon Defenders. The player takes on the role of a Squire, Apprentice, Huntress, or Monk using traps, barricades and magic to defend the castle from an army of evil creatures these would-be child heroes have mistakenly unleashed. Each level plays out in an arena with several entry points for enemies to spawn from. It is the player’s job to analyze the level map and exploit choke points with barricades and traps to prevent enemies from destroying the Eternia crystal at the center of the map. The game is played from the third-person perspective, requiring characters to traverse the map to set up towers while battling enemies along the way.Enemies are varied and numerous, requiring different strategies to counter their abilities. Hulking orcs will devastate defenses, mages heal enemy units, and suicidal kobolds rush towers with dynamite strapped to their backs. Minibosses in the form of giant ogres made us rethink our tower placement in several situations and the major bosses present the biggest challenges in the game.Dungeon Defenders has all of the workings of the standard RPG fused into the tower defense gameplay. Player classes have unique abilities, armor, weapon types, and towers. Killing enemies, conquering campaign levels, and completing challenges earns experience which unlocks abilities and towers as well as more powerful items. Character and tower attributes can be upgraded with points earned upon leveling through a somewhat confusing menu system – improving maximum health, damage, casting speed, and movement speed, among others.All of these features add a great deal of replayability to the game – as does the multiplayer. Once we worked through the levels and beefed up one character, we wanted to level up a complementary character to make proper use of the character swap feature and get the upper hand on some of the more difficult challenges. Setting up spiked barricades as the Squire and switching to the Apprentice to place projectile throwing magic towers makes for a devastating combination. It feels great to level up a character, unlock the advanced towers, and add them to your defense strategy. Playing with a friend or three adds a new dimension in strategy as we were required to actively communicate in tower placement, mana distribution, and repair efforts to hold back the onslaught. The real fun comes in joining a party of friends to tackle the hardest challenges and picking up epic loot.Unfortunately the action aspect of gameplay falls short. The combat became stale very quickly. Although the characters have special abilities like the Squire’s spin attack or the Huntress’ invisibility, we rarely found a need to use them. Enemies were easily dispatched with well-placed towers and planning trap layouts and developing strategies was fun, but jumping into the fray was not – especially with the melee characters. Combat essentially involves mashing on the one attack button and maybe throwing in a special ability for kicks. Neither feels particularly effective and leaves the combat feeling shallow.Another problem we had with Dungeon Defenders was the loot. Items can be found in treasure chests and is also dropped by enemies. Picking up epic new armor or weapons and equipping them to benefit from their attribute bonuses is a strong motivator to up the difficulty on the challenges, but the problem lies in having to sort through piles and piles of useless loot at the end of a wave. Checking each dropped item’s stats to compare to our equipped set slowed the game down considerably since all of the loot is spread across the map and it takes at least a few seconds to inspect an item. While we could just run through the map and throw everything into our item box to review later, having fewer, more useful drops would have kept loot gathering from becoming such a chore.Dungeon Defenders is a worthwhile addition to your game library with plenty of content for the price. Although the combat falls short, the tower defense gameplay, RPG elements, and the challenging game modes will have fans of tower defense delighted. "

												Got this game cheap during the Halloween sale and I couldn't be happier with it.  I was looking for a game to play with my two kids under 10 and this has been perfect for us to play together.I've been impressed with how much it has kept my attention, I thought this would just be a mindless button masher.  But between all of the characters (we bought them all), the massive amount of loot and the strategy of the tower placement, we have not been bored yet in close to 8 hours of play.  And better yet - we've only scratched the surface.So to those looking for a game to play with the family - I'd give this a definite thumbs up.  My kids struggled a bit to grasp some of the concepts in the beginning but once they figured out the strategy of placing the towers and how to evaluate whether the loot was better than what they already had, it was easy.  It's been really fun working together.Quick note for anyone else interested - I am using the mouse/keyboard and my kids are using xbox controllers - definitely working out well.			"

												If you're playing single player, you might not enjoy this that much. If, however, you're playing with a friend (or three), especially if you're playing locally, then you'll likely have a lot of fun.It's a tower defense game with RPG levelling elements and randomly generated loot galore.  The regular campaign is interesting, and the eternia shards campaign extends the challenge and the difficulty a great deal, but it introduce new enemies which have some... balance issues.  The game can get a bit grindy at points while you try to acquire new loot, and some of the extended/additional levels really don't seem that well thought out, but there is still a lot of fun to be had with this game.If a tower defense with RPG elements piques your interested, then I'd just go the whole hog and get the full collection - it's definitely worth your money (especially if it's on sale). There is the potentially for many, many hours of gameplay here, provided you're interested in the style and the strategy. The only warning I would give is that it's much less fun single player, and the online multiplayer community is fairly limited at this point in time.  If you need to play online for your multiplayer, I'd probably just wait until Dungeon Defenders 2 comes out and see how that's received.			"

												Dungeon Defenders is a great tower defense that let you control the field in FPS mode.  Plus, your character levels up, gets more powerful with weapons and gears, and let you change the look.  This character building is very addictive.  I only recommend this if you can put in a lot of time.			"

												I think by reading other reviews, you can already assume this is a great, addictive game.I'm not writing this review to once more praise the game, instead, I want to take this time to write about how great Trendy Entertainment is as a company. The team seems to be doing great now and i'm sure the atmosphere back in the studio is much better than it used to be.That said, Trendy Entertainment is an exemplary indie company, putting their players and customers first. They care immensely about what you think of their game, their practices but first and foremost, they care about you.I want to publicly thank Trendy Entertainment for giving my brother the Dungeon Defenders Collection, that was awfully nice of you. I know you guys worked hard, long hours and sacrificed a lot during the development. We, the community, will support you and give you back the love you deserve.			"

This game features many DLC's all of which are frequently on sale during summer and various other events, so if you're keen on getting a few new classes or even the Eternia Shards DLC, keep an eye out!If you enjoy strategically planning and placing towers at your own will, and grinding various hours to have the best equipement look no more!

You can do everything from playing with your friends side by side to defend the crystalls from all the evil mobs, to fight them yourself in a funny pvp type of game. When you are close to 500 hours on a game, it got to be good.			"

												At first I thought this game was going to be ho hum, yet another tower defense/FPS in an ever-growing genre.  I had already picked up Sanctum and Orcs Must Die and thought, why would I want this?  So I passed initially.  I wish I hadn't.  This game is actually very engrossing.  Sure, gear is of great importance, esp. in Endgame, but there is quite a bit of strategy involved.  Plus, the community is great, so you also get to have a lot of fun.  Highly recommended.Make sure you also buy Shards Complete DLC, which is *the* Endgame.  Enjoy!			"

												So most of the community has died and games are pretty hard to find for low levels that don't have some super high OP people in them now.. I still wish they gave us what they orginally promised and updated this game rather then making a new one.. I don't think anything will ever replace this game and I love it to death still.  It's a beautiful game to get together with a group of friends and play you can really have a lot of fun with it still.  Starting out fresh and going through all that struggle again it's still a good feeling.  I still do recommend this game but at the same time it is pretty much dead.. I am saddened by that as well.. I wish it would be updated and gave more attention to really is a brilliant game.			"

												It's a really fun game, at least for the first 100 hours or so. You'll be stuck on constant grinding in order to progress and  defeat some of the harder maps. For now I stopped playing because the grinding just isn't really fun anymore. Sometimes seeing hackers all over the already scarce number of people playing online is just disheartening. Just don't interact with them and leave the room and report them.Nonetheless, I still recommend this game for those who are big TD fans and a game that makes me waste more than 100 hours is pretty worth it imo.

												It's a really fun game, at least for the first 100 hours or so. You'll be stuck on constant grinding in order to progress and  defeat some of the harder maps. For now I stopped playing because the grinding just isn't really fun anymore. Sometimes seeing hackers all over the already scarce number of people playing online is just disheartening. Just don't interact with them and leave the room and report them.Nonetheless, I still recommend this game for those who are big TD fans and a game that makes me waste more than 100 hours is pretty worth it imo.

												Fun game. I almost exclusively play local co-op with one of my friends. The local co-op is definitely my favorite feature in this otherwise solid game. Defend the crystal from waves, pick up items, upgrade characters and weapons, set up towers... Addictingly fun. Easy to pick up. Actually challenging on harder modes. Get it if you want to play with friends.			"

												Dungeon defenders is an amazing game. It takes all of the fun of a normal tower defense game and combines it with a fps kind of. You have the option of first or third person point of view with your character and there are tons of customization options not with apperance unfortunatlly, but with your stats. If you wanna go all out dps then you can or maybe you wanna have the strongest towers in the game you can. You can even go both and still be really good. All classes are balanced and all of the maps are fun and different to where you'll have to change up your strategy everytime to get maximum efficiency. After you finish up the campaign on all 5 difficulties plus hardcore, pure strategy, and survival there are a ton of challanges for you to work on. After all of that there are steam workshop missions, DLC missions ( campaign and challanges), and even pvp maps so you can test your strength and strategies against your friends and other online players. Over all I give this game a 9/10 because there are always things that can be improved in all games, but please check out this game and start having tons of fun. There are still other things i haven't mentioned about this game, but you'll have to buy the game and play it for yourself to find out. There is also Dungeon Defenders 2 comming out soon so get in the bandwagon now and beat this game for practice. Hope to see ya'll on the battlefield helping to defend the eternia crystals.			"

												Dungeon Defenders, a good game i find myself lost in time when i play. The storyline is simple, kids parents get taken you have to rescue them. They have the storyline layed out well the controls are easy once you know them. With the dlc, the dlc adds a lot to this game but you dont need it to play, wait for a sale and get it i got the game+all the dlc for 5 bucks. Also dungeon defenders has some really nice people that play almost all my friend play even if i met them on a different game.			"

												This game is amazing it's like someone took the best part of Tower Defense from Warcraft and slapped it into Diablo II. You can build cool towers then sit back and drink a coke or you can play a combat focused class and be in the middle of the fray. The learning curve takes a bit to figure out on multi-player games and you might get yelled at once or twice for picking up something you can't use but overall it's a pretty easy game to get good at and a pain to be great. Most of the players are pretty laid back and cool, many times someone jumps in to give me advise randomly. I would also suggest you don't play this game alone. Friends, even random players, make this game more fun by a factor of 10. Not to mention you can see strats in play and how the other classes operate. I would say go for the Collection pack if you can the extra classes and maps are very cool and change the game play a little. If not you might get Jelly early watching others playing them. I put in about 40 hours since I got the game and I haven't even scratched the surface. Get in on a 75% off sale and you won't be disappointed.			"

There are a lot of different challenge modes, difficulty settings, maps and even some PvP modes like CTF and such.  All in all it is a really fun game and well worth the price.This game also has a ton of DLC at this point.

												Great game! Love pretty much everything about it. Only problems I can mention are:• Cannot conect to online play. Whenever I try ""Quick Match"" on both Open and Ranked mode, it instantly says ""Did not find any games"". Sometimes, in Ranked, it states it cannot conect to Trendy.net• Cannot try betas. A beta has just recently been released, and I was looking foward to trying it. When I took the steps to use it, then opened the game, the features remained the same as the previous update. And yes, I went through all the steps to properly install betas.• Incredible lag. This is most likely my computer, but sometimes I will open the game, and everything will be running at 3 or less frames per second. While this occurs, my computer will be running fine, so this lag is purely from the game.Hope someone looks at this review. Doubt it. Anyways, thanks for a great game, pretty much worth the slightly overpriced 60 dollars I put into it.			"

												One of the best examples of ""indie"" gaming in recent years. A real joy to sink many, many hours into.It hybrids straight up Tower Defence with 3rd person battling so very well that it's without peer. A lovely clean art style which is well presented so that it remains easy on the eye even during periods of intense action and after hours of play. Fighting is very fluid indeed, and where it also shines is in the variety of character classes and their applicable skills.The Mage for example, has the most conventional options in straight-up towers that fire missiles. Monks and Archer have some clever traps and AOE placings. Played on their own they really demand different layouts and tactics, but when played together (you can place traps/towers with one character and switch and combine them on the fly) they REALLY sing.This lends itself to some very good multiplayer play.Content-wise, the main campaign is solid, and will last you a good few hours on the first playthrough. However, with various difficulty settings (and the appropriate loot to go with them) it begs repeated play. You're unlikely to get bored with these basic levels, as they are very well designed, and will offer the freedom for a variety of experimentation in layouts.But, if this were not enough, there's also a myriad of challenges based on these maps which will truly test your abilities - with their own unique rewards too!So, add in Steam Workshop ability which has been well-supported by the community, and you have one of the best bang-for-your-buck games on Steam.If you love Tower Defence, or even are remotely interested in the genre, then this is an essential purchase.

												Dungeon Defenders is a quirky little game where, on top of being a tower defense, you also have to run around and shoot things. Ever played Sanctum 1 or 2? Then keep your money, bud, cause this is just a less fun version.The basic premise is you four heroes in training must hold the line against invading waves of heroes while the real heroes are out gettin donuts or somethin. I didn't pay attention to that bit. So you build turrets and collect resources dropped from chests and enemies to build turrets or to upgrade your abilities and weapons. In the end we have an tower defense third person shooter with rpg elements. It's got a cute little cell shaded graphic style that I can't help but find appealing and honestly the actual mechanics of it all aren't half bad if you can excuse the fact that projectile attacks are virtually useless if not awkward as a 14 year old trying to talk about his sexual experiences in a positive light. Yeah I bet you got it good last night, Uncle Paul.So why not reccomend it? BECAUSE IT'S BOOOOOOOOORING. Honestly, the game is so unbelievably slow paced. Everything is slow, the enemies are slow, the projectiles are slow, the turrets are slow, every attack is slow and boring and lame. I'd call it a childrens game, but Kameo: Elements of Power was a childrens game and on the hardest difficulty can at least keep you paying attention. You know what else is a childrens game? The Legend of Zelda. A game that isn't combat orriented still has far superior combat mechanics and faster paced gameplay then a game that boasts it. On top of the slow game play, it's just plain awkward. Projectile attacks can hardly be called skill shots, since the move barely any faster than the enemies and you never run out of amunition. Only the mage and the knight are really worth anything because the knight can literally just stop an entire wave with two turrets and shell them with cannonballs that are basically 2 hit kills on large enemies. The monk supposedly has healing abilities but there's never any need because you have to actually try to die in this game. Simply put, it's boring. It's cute, it's quirky, it's unique(kinda), but it's just too slow. It's upgrade system is just a massive min/maxfest and leaves so much to be desired.Should you buy it?Do you play EVE online? Yes? This game is gonna be too slow even for you.			"

												This game is the sole purpose of my life.  The dungeons are like pure oceans of beauty that touch my soul and caress my thighs (metaphorically). As I plunge into them, they envelop my body and stimulate my galloping abs. With every keystroke my heart beats faster, and my spine tingles from the endless adventure and heartwrenching story.  I had never cried in my life, but this game touched me in ways that can never be undone. No one was there to wipe the tears flowing from my glimmering eyes, but when I looked into the mages eyes I felt safe again.  The heat of his passion dried my tears and warmed my fragile heart.  Never again will I feel lonely, alone in my bedroom with no escape.  As I defended dungeons, I realized my reason for living in this dangerous world.  I have transcended the human world, and am now living with a purpose. The dungeons. They call for me.			"

												I bought this quite some time ago. I played it for hours... days... weeks... then out of nowhere the game took the biggest dump I have ever witnessed in a game. It went from a balanced and fun strategy game to a number crunching nightmare of trolls and children. If you bought this game to play casually a tiny bit every so often while it is on sale, you will probably enjoy it. However, if you try to go further, expect to grow further and further disappointed as you go beyond the base game.

												Too many hackers, too many problems and instead of fixing them trendy makes a seperate version and slaps another price tag on that version rather than supplying their loyal customer base with a free copy.Having purchased the game upwards of 5 times (for myself, friends and wife) and almost all of the DLC as it came out I feel incredibly cheated by Trendy's business plan and cannot recommend anyone spending money with them in the future.The game itself is solid, I love it, but I would recommend never doing business with trendy because they are not ethical and may well drop support for a game you paid for just to make a carbon copy of it and ask for you to pay again if things don't work out.

												These types of games are what I usually call DLC farms. They trick you into buying the base game at a low price and then try to sell you on the DLC to get the complete experience. I'm not a fan of DLC in general and definitely not a fan of this type of predatory practice. DLC aside, the game is fun. It is a co-op tower defense. There are classes you can choose from. The game does have problems with cheating.I wouldn't recommend picking this game up unless you can get the complete package for cheap or in a bundle. Even if you think you have the complete package, they'll probably release new DLC shortly.I will update this review to be more in-depth at a later time.			"

												Dungeon Defenders is one of the laziest horde defense games I've ever played. After downloading the game you are immediatly swarmed with adverts for their dlc and offers. This is really annoying because it gets in the way of the gameplay and slows everything down to a snails pace. There is virtually no tutorial to speak of; you need to figure out how to play the game on your own. You have 4 starting classes to choose from (unless you shelled out the extra cash to buy more characters). The classes themselves are actually somewhat unique, but it becomes quickly apparent that there are two classes that outshine the others. The graphics are ugly, bright, and basic. My eyes were sore after playing for a few hours. The items that the game occasionally spits at you don't feel unique or interesting at all. The gameplay revolves around collecting gems, putting up towers, and occasionally chopping down bigger monsters. The only part about this game I enjoyed was playing with my friends. The game is dull, unbalanced, and sluggish. Don't buy this.			"

												Have you played orcs must die before? have you? ok this game is no where like it.1) the graphics , textures , artwork is fairly pleasing.2) game play is way too smooth , controls are easy and simple.3) incase you didn't know its a tower defence game , so the ''action'' isn't going beyond building some towers and watching them.4) well , you can also buy gears , combine and upgrade your weapon/equipments , enhancing them , adding abilities and etc , and you can also buy pets , super rare ones , with weekly refreshed shop (you can use ingame currency)5) also this game was atempting to make a mmo community inside it , but i guess they faild duo to several reasons and they are: a) the servers are ...... <- you can insert any bad word here , because simply theres missions you can't pass alone , so you need company , and when u ask for one , the ingame servers may not be dead but , can't support to connect people from different countries.b) the game itself is at a point is so repeatitive and rather boring , which will make u eventually get bored even if you play with friends.c) you may spend lots of time just to grind for decent equipments and then find out that your level has grown during that , that you wont be needing this equipments anymore ( you will need new ones ).-This game is nice , but i dont recommend you to buy it at full price , and i dont recommend you to have it at all if you don't like that type of game genre either.  6/10.

												On first sight, you may think this game is for kids.Well, it is.. but behind all this realy for young people looking graphics there is a genius game.I would say its the most interactive TD (Tower Defense) Game i have seen so far.+++ Coop online and / SPLITSCREEN !++ Many stages (actually infinite because of the workshop) ++ Class system - You may start as knight or Mage or whatever++ 3D (awesome for a TD game already)++ Its not just building Towers / You can actually ""be"" the tower (classes which dont use towers) or just create a bubble that slows enemys ( monk )++ Many Items ( Little helpers, armor or guns / all custom upgradable [Maybe you got gloves that give the player HP or Tower HP and you dont want Tower HP, you will just upgrade the players HP])++ Lovely money system-/+ If you play on that no cheat servers (which do not support custom maps), you will have to pay alot for map packs. NOTE: These packs contain some realy awesome maps! Some packs give you maps where you have to destroy the towers and achieve something.-- Can be boring as you arrive on the top level-- Kid graphics-- custom maps may lead to cheat weapons that you can just earn on themI hope that helped you guys out. For me, it was a nice game by the time I played it.			"

												By the definition of MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena), Dungeon Defenders is one. Dungeon Defenders took this one step further, and added in Tower Defense to the mix. Makes for a nice variation of available playstyles, ranging from tactical tower placement, to full-on onslaught physical offense. Enjoyable little chibi-style characters give the game an entertaining environment. The audio tracks are very atmospheric for what's going on in-game, and most of the levels offer enough variety from one to the other to keep the game entertaining for playthrough one. However, after the initial playthrough, the game gets incredibly grindy. Having beaten most of the game on medium or hard difficulty on my first run, I ended at nearly level 50, but most of the post-game content (almost) requires levels into the seventies. Very entertaining game to grab a few friends and use for a LAN party or general multiplayer shenanigans, but can quickly become a grind-fest for any single-player fans out there.			"

												With Dungeon Defenders 2 in Early Access, I'm not sure how many people are going to want to buy this game now but I gave myself a personal mission to review all the games in my library and that includes this one.I'll tip my hat and keep it as brief as possible.I recommend this game, this was my introduction to Tower Defense and it was lot of fun. I did not appreciate the fact that my Adept was mandatory at all times to solo things, since his defenses were the only ones I found strong enough to withstand the monster waves if I swapped to another character.The base game without spending alot in extra DLC doesn't offer a whole lot of levels or variety to keep things fresh. You'll cruise through those levels and then I found myself grinding the same level over and over for mana to buy gear because I sure wasn't going to see anything useful ever drop and I don't know how viable buying gear from other players is anymore.I know, I mostly listed negatives but this game WAS fun and WAS enjoyable. It's a great idea at it's core, it just didn't offer enough content even with the DLC (since most of those levels aren't worth farming for any reason), to keep my interest for terribly long. That said, I still burned tons of hours on this game. You can see that I believe.Dungeon Defenders 1 is a good game and it's fun to play but with the sequel in Early Access, I can only hope they see all the shortcomings they had with this game do a much better job with the sequel. This was a great idea, and I hope they build on it and make the sequel into what this game could have been.Don't pay alot for this if you're interested. You won't find it entertaing for long, but for as long as you do play it, you'll have fun with it. It was a really neat game that in spite of alot of fumbles in it's design direction, came out a blast to sink alot of hours into.			"

I was vac banned (along with several hundred other people) from this game's servers a few months after release after using an autoclicker (the game's basic attack requires spamming your clicker) advertised for use by a Moderator on their Official Forums. Soon after the bans went out and rage started spewing in on that post the moderater account magically disappeared and trendy had no idea what the angry threads were about. Unfortunately due to lack of publicity and unsympathetic assumptions on those banned this issue was never properly resolved.TL;DR - Good game, Beware the company that can't own up to their mistakes and ratify them after wrongfully banning users via VAC.

												Dungeon Defenders started out as a fun game that mixed tower defense with hack-and-slash gameplay. As it evolved through numerous patches it became intensely grind-focused and towers became less and less useful, leaving the game a hack-and-slash mess. This all culminated in sessions that would last hours, grinding hundreds of mobs against useless towers in the hope of a single piece of useful gear two or three hours into a play session. If that gear dropped, you would of course have to grind more to level it up.Although I haven't played in more than a year, when I left, it was a waste of time.			"

												You need to play Dungeon Defenders with other people. Sure, you could struggle alone and fail repeatedly across the many levels and risk missing the core of the game, but if you gather some friends for local co-op, or even go online with random strangers, you'll find countless hours of entrancingly addictive gameplay as it was intended to be enjoyed. So basically, if you have friends to play with..get the game. If not, don't bother (unless you enjoy playing with strangers).			"

												Have you played orcs must die before? have you? ok this game is no where like it.1) the graphics , textures , artwork is fairly pleasing.2) game play is way too smooth , controls are easy and simple.3) incase you didn't know its a tower defence game , so the ''action'' isn't going beyond building some towers and watching them.4) well , you can also buy gears , combine and upgrade your weapon/equipments , enhancing them , adding abilities and etc , and you can also buy pets , super rare ones , with weekly refreshed shop (you can use ingame currency)5) also this game was atempting to make a mmo community inside it , but i guess they faild duo to several reasons and they are: a) the servers are ...... <- you can insert any bad word here , because simply theres missions you can't pass alone , so you need company , and when u ask for one , the ingame servers may not be dead but , can't support to connect people from different countries.b) the game itself is at a point is so repeatitive and rather boring , which will make u eventually get bored even if you play with friends.c) you may spend lots of time just to grind for decent equipments and then find out that your level has grown during that , that you wont be needing this equipments anymore ( you will need new ones ).-This game is nice , but i dont recommend you to buy it at full price , and i dont recommend you to have it at all if you don't like that type of game genre either.  6/10.

												With Dungeon Defenders 2 in Early Access, I'm not sure how many people are going to want to buy this game now but I gave myself a personal mission to review all the games in my library and that includes this one.I'll tip my hat and keep it as brief as possible.I recommend this game, this was my introduction to Tower Defense and it was lot of fun. I did not appreciate the fact that my Adept was mandatory at all times to solo things, since his defenses were the only ones I found strong enough to withstand the monster waves if I swapped to another character.The base game without spending alot in extra DLC doesn't offer a whole lot of levels or variety to keep things fresh. You'll cruise through those levels and then I found myself grinding the same level over and over for mana to buy gear because I sure wasn't going to see anything useful ever drop and I don't know how viable buying gear from other players is anymore.I know, I mostly listed negatives but this game WAS fun and WAS enjoyable. It's a great idea at it's core, it just didn't offer enough content even with the DLC (since most of those levels aren't worth farming for any reason), to keep my interest for terribly long. That said, I still burned tons of hours on this game. You can see that I believe.Dungeon Defenders 1 is a good game and it's fun to play but with the sequel in Early Access, I can only hope they see all the shortcomings they had with this game do a much better job with the sequel. This was a great idea, and I hope they build on it and make the sequel into what this game could have been.Don't pay alot for this if you're interested. You won't find it entertaing for long, but for as long as you do play it, you'll have fun with it. It was a really neat game that in spite of alot of fumbles in it's design direction, came out a blast to sink alot of hours into.			"

												Very fun game 788 hours on it, After 400 hours though you will most likely start getting very bored of it as that's probably around when you've done anything.Game has no Anti Cheat (Cheat Engine works... like wtf) so be ready to report people (I think it's like trendy.zendesk.com to report bugs and players). You will most likely run into one cheater every couple of hours you play.Game is dead for the most part during week days and since people don't know how to change the minimum level to join their game until you get lvl 40 on weekends you will probably never be able to join a game.Most of the pros play private games and farm and usually only communicate with other players through the forums.Overall it's very fun... or was. I played it most often when the community was alive and doing well. Most players are either noobs or pros.The game is quite taxing on your PC due to effects that happen. Protips: Go up to someone not during a wave and press the button that comes up to view their stats. If their gear isn't ultimate and has above 800 on any stat its hacked and if their weapon does like 999999 damage its hacked.			"

												This game will take part of your life and turn it into good memories. It has nice graphics, balanced class system (eventho it might not look like it for first first ~50hours in), quite okay storyline and the best, great loot system!I really recommend it for persons who like to grind and get better gear and challenge from higher difficulties, which is really rewarding.End-game becomes really, really hard at one point, but that's only about 150+ hours in. This game is totally worth playing and buying all the DLC's (which are by the way pretty viable for the experience and are also cheap), because it's fun alone and even more fun with friends!There's also a pvp-mode but that's nothing special in my opinion.If you buy this game, play on ranked mode, because there's no reason not to and prepare yourself to spend hours and hours on map called Magus Quarters!

												Basically, the developers tried to chart in very-well-charted areas but ended up charting them all on the same chart. Tower defense, hack'n'slash, ""RPG"" elements, it's definitely all there. The big question is: does it work? To sum it up, my answer is ""not quite"". Dungeon Defenders works on the base premise that there's something that must be left untouched by the vile horde of monsters in a fantasy setting for its core gameplay. And as advertised, you can pick any of the hero classes and have multiple heroes with persisting stats the longer you play the game, swapping them out as needed. Each hero has multiple stats, the ""RPG"" elements now, that make it more proficient in their respective stats' areas. Care to improve your tower damage? Stat it up on gaining a level. Maybe you want to make your hero beefier? Same deal. Move speed, hero's damage, cast time improvements? It's all there. There's even equipment for the heroes to use and pets that function as ""stat sticks"" if nothing else; arguably the most important piece of equipment are weapons.Each level works in waves, which is a good thing. Since every wave is always the same, unless in certain cases, you can memorize how waves play out and plan how to place your defenses. Simple enough; just do what works for you, some would say.But here's where it gets messy: defense points, used to place defenses, ARE SHARED BETWEEN PLAYERS. What does that mean? It means that someone that specialized in tower-gameplay stats will be prefered for building rather than a hybrid or an ""action-hero""-built someone. And this is where the game simply is broken; they encourage this sort of behaviour further with insane higher difficulty modes, where everyone has to be just perfect to win. If you're out with your tower builder you gain experience with him, and vice-versa with your action guy. Playing alone, then, is frustrating because if you're switching around you're not really efficient either.It also doesn't feel rewarding to be a good tower-builder, because if you're online someone else will just be using their left mouse button to mash the hordes down in between doing their best to avoid your towers' innevitable demise. It feels rewarding to be that button masher, but not the strategist that should-but-isn't able to defeat the insane difficulty level's horde; that's my biff with this game.Yes, it's fun at first. But unless you're playing in the ""unregulated"" league you're only going to reach the beggining of the end-game without a good group online, and playing in the unregulated league is where all the hackage and cheat-enabled characters are, which make the game pointless anyway. My final recomendation? Play the game, but be prepared to think it was all a waste of time.			"

												Probably one of the best tower defense games ive played in my life and even to this day its a blast to play, this game took what was once considered a dead genre and put a huge twist. By giving the player their own hero in which you are able to control and take part in the action, leveling up as you progress, earning equipment and customizing them by improving the stats how you wish. Not to mention the depths of strategy involed and using every class of heros (Including the huge amount of DLC classes). Now some may say that this game is only fun with friends and while i admit that is true, i really enjoyed soloing the game and its levels as it provided quite a challenge and since you can change to any of your heroes inbetween waves it allowed me to setup defenses that would normally require multiple players. Overall this game shall forever be remembered as one of greatest tower defense games of all time.10/10			"

												Although it has its bugs, this game was a highly enjoyable experience with its wacky ups and downs. With an amazing art style and gamemodes that kept challenging. The sequel is currently in closed alpha and I hope it is just as good as this game was :)			"

												RECOMMENDATION:*Yes, if you enjoy fast & slow paced defending games with a twist of multiple hero combat styles*No, because of the dead community and corrupt hack tools players use.GAME IMPRESSION:The game is a fun and decent pace defending game. Like all tower defences but the actual First & third person view with multiple Heros and weapons to choose from. Has a good use of switching characters throughout gameplay for different attack styles and defences through each game. Online was good at the start but the community is unfortuanely dead and it wasn't to challenging.GAME DIFFICULTY:*Very easy but can be difficult on Achievement HuntingCOMPLETION TIME:*Main campaign: Around 14.5 Hours*Main + Extra: Around 53 Hours*Completionist: Around 450+ Hours*Credits:http://howlongtobeat.com/game.php?id=2939GAME MODE:= Campaign Mode= Multiplayer Mode= Co-op Mode+Many characters to choose from (can play all)+Swapping of characters within gameplay (attack style, defences *During gameplay*)+Many weapons, defences+Decent amount of maps +Item Trading+A lot of variaty steam achievement+A lot items to discover-Dead Community-Not very difficult-Lack of interesting in skill upgrade-To many item drops-Item Dupes-Online Hack Tool(s)ENJOYMENT: *Overall 7/10 MORE INFORMATION:*IGN review score 8.5/10http://ca.ign.com/games/dungeon-defenders/pc-84699FILE SIZE:2GBWORTH BUYING?*Yes, if you wanted developer make a good game in future!*No, if you can wait for 80% steam sale*Price History: "

												Dungeon Defenders is a overall fun and addicting game with friends, It's very much alike with the sanctum series. I dearly love both series and continue to play them to this dayPros- Great Gameplay- Unique Classes (Excluding DLC)- Many different maps and bosses and enemies so a good playabily valueCons- It's boring playing solo (I recommend getting friends to play this with you it's more rewarding)- Most of the dlc classes are reskin of the original classes- - It may get repetitive while playing for a while you know wave goes monster come kill monster protect crystal but it gives more a challenge at the higher levels YOU HAVE TO DEFEND 3 CRYSTALS!!!! 3!!!! It's hard man try it yourself....My rating: 8/10Cons aside, It's still a very good game with high replay value.			"

												After playing this for a few hours, I was loving it - no stopping me. I managed to reach level 35 on my Apprentice since I love the way I can just sit back and just repair my turrets without going in myself and fighting them like Warriors do. After that, level 70's started joining my game, so I thought ""Oh wow some help is great!"". After a few hours of them helping me grind the constant waves of monsters, I found myself at level 65. I started doubting why I even let them join me, not in a rude way but in a way that it started getting boring because I basically let them level up for me.Although this was a huge mistake, it was a mistake made by me. A mistake I didn't think would happen. The game I loved to play turned into a game I found so boring in just a few hours. I now have 3 level 100's since I didn't have access to other classes at the time. That's another thing - class selection. You have to buy DLC to unlock other class's to play, which can be a little bit over-priced just for a new class. For example, the Summoner DLC costs £2.99 just for one class!This game does seem a little bit like they are forcing you to buy DLC, since it always comes up on the screen when you load up the game, as well as when you pick the level nearly everything you have to pay for - but that's just my opinion.

												Before start if you are wondering which you should buy:  Dungeon Defenders 1 or Dungeon Defenders 2. I will recommend you to buy Dungeon Defenders 1 because Dungeon Defenders 2 doesnt have much content at the moment (March 1 2015) Dungeon Defenders 2 is get to level 25 and farm for legendary gear(Dungeon Defenders 2 is on alpha).Perfect game that let you build defenses how you want also you can put the stats where you want (for make a tower character or DPS character) which is really helpful i really recommend this game my favorite game so far. But it has one problem, which you can evade but sometimes you need to know about this game.The problem is the 99% of the events and best gear is hacked but they try to make it look legit or they just farm good gear duplicate it and sell it but usually the hacked gear is for level 83-100 but theres also  of all levels but thats quite  obvious because damage is 1 billion and stats are all 849 (add me and send me a message if you need help with gear or post it on dungeon defenders forums on: forums/trading/Item Check Thread and ask for item check                                                                       (  https://www.dungeondefenders.com/1/forum/11/trading  )).I have 600+ hours here and i started to get quite bored because ive already done everything but ive seen people with 1k+ hours and they still enoy it, the community is 7/10 because most are hackers or they kick you from games or they just insult you but most of the people is helpful, farming can get annoying doing the map over and over again but when you are high level almost everything is afkable so its fine (i had never found farming annoying but ive seen people getting mad of not getting a good weapon)Also theres some dlc's you should not buy like the skins and the valentines day dlc but if you want to go for all achievements buy valentines day dlc (valentines day have 2 maps which are pain in the♥♥♥♥♥the most annoying maps of all game) but should try and get all dlc's or it wont be as fun as it should.9/10 but if you are able to evade hacking as much as possible 10/10(read other reviews since i didnt covered 100% of the game)			"

												I'm conflicted. The base game w/ the DLC that came before the Eternia Shards Campaign is a total gem of a Co-op Tower Defense game that is totally worth your time and money.Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for what came after, as the game has over time been slowly transformed into a totally infuriating grindfest, plagued by poor decisions from the devs. Getting decent gear becomes a nightmare later on, due to negative stat rolls everywhere, random upgrade values and the vast quantities of garbage that drops.Nightmare difficuly was a tacked-on, unbalanced mess that made entire strategies null and void.  Character classes became either totally mandatory (Summoner/EV) or totally useless.However, I still recommend the base game to anyone who loves TD.  Hell, if you like endless grinding, I guess the DLC will float your boat too - just don't say I didn't warn you. "

												Summary: Orcs Must Die with experience and loot.Multiplayer: up to 8Completion: 20 hrsCards: NoCloud: No (but has online-mode saves)Dungeon Defenders plays out much like Orcs Must Die, where you attack waves of enemies emerging from several entrances by using towers, traps, minions, or just plain weapons. The game supports up to quite a few players, though four players is a safe bet for most maps.There's a lot to like about the game. It has a fairly good progression, as level-ups and items felt like large improvements in the early game. As you head towards the endgame though, item upgrades become much less frequent, and you may struggle on a number of later hardcore maps. Notably... there's a distinct lack of a proper tutorial. It does not teach you things like what your health bar and mana bar is. It does not teach you how to equip things. It does not teach you about sets. It does not teach you about upgrading items.Interestingly, the game allows you to switch heroes on the fly between rounds. Thus you can benefit from defenses another character you have, and then switch back to the one you want to level. It's an interesting idea, as it greatly simplifies the need for grinding, but at the same time, the early charm is entirely lost because you are packing high-powered defenses on a low level character and can just afk to victory with minimal strategy. Shrug. It's hard to say if the benefits outweigh the downsides.Each map allots you and your party a shared Defense Unit (DU) pool with which to summon  your defenses. I kind of wish there was a slight change to DU. I'd like it so that every character had a minimum DU devoted to themselves, and the rest would be a shared DU. That way all players would have at least some use for tower stats. Tower placement can get a but clumsy, since you can only summon within a short radius of your position. If the tower is too close to certain things, then you can't place it. All too often I find myself needing to cancel, reposition, and try to summon again, which can be problematic in combat when mobs may be attacking you. Unlike OMD there is no means to shape your enemy paths, but you can place structures that enemies will attack.The game likes to throw loot at you. A lot of it. You'll be seeing items left and right, polluting the entire field, and you won't know what to grab. Fortunately the game includes a rudimentary system that puts an indicator on items it thinks may be an upgrade for you, however more often than not the indicator is completely wrong. All the items you loot go to your item bank, which unfortunately is very poorly managed. You can create your own folders, but doing so shrinks your items visible per page. I would have really liked a way to sort and reorder items myself. At this point I would settle for nothing but a columns of text instead of the gigantic 12 icons at a time.This game offers one very nice feature most other games in this genre do not - the ability to change camera angles. By zooming in and out with the mouse wheel you can go seamlessly into first person, over-the-shoulder, and overhead views. I can't tell how much I wanted a feature like this in other games! There's even a 4th sort of view if you play as the Summoner, who can enter an RTS-like mode, which is even better. One handy touch is that if you die, especially in hardcore, you are allowed to free-roam the map while dead. It's nice to see the outside environment and to scout for other party members while in this mode.Dungeon Defenders offers five difficulties per map. You can probably ignore the first few, as those are almost always too easy. However, the game could probably use another difficulty between insane and nightmare. There is a sudden spike when you hit nightmare as you fight enemies with considerably more health, and the ability to air drop from anywhere. I had a lot of fun playing through the maps with some friends when the maps would just barely kick our butt, typically beating us on the last wave. Eventually we got our act together and can blow through almost everything, but the process of discovery was great. With the exception of one map, the game seems to run pretty well in multiplayer with minimal lag, so thumbs up for that!I am impressed at the variety of play modes the game offers. It goes well beyond the standard tower defense, including modes such as PvP, run a gauntlet, escort the crystal, and more. I much enjoyed the journey to reach high levels. It's a shame I can't really experience that again. It's a great multiplayer experience, I'll grant it that. I give Dungeon Defenders a 8.5/10, mainly knocking points for the Item Bank that is incredibly tedious to sift through. If you like tower defense + shooters, this game will serve you well.			"

												It only took around 750~ cumulative hours, but I finally got all the achievements.This game is great. It's the perfect mix of heroes and towers defending dungeons in the beginning of the game. Later on however when you get to levels 70+ and the experience and difficulty curves ramp heavily; it can become a grinding game if you're intent on getting a full set of heroes level 100 equipped with mythical grade gear and higher. It's convenient to have your own set of builders but you don't necessarily need them; you're able to focus on your pure dps and join other peoples games. That's a pathetic reason on why not to get builders. Don't do that. Level some builders and give them some gear.ps. Don't get Eternity. Yeah you get the dlc included but there's no community for it; you want community come to the original. "

												Dungeon Defenders (DD) is a great game to kick back and have fun on. Pros:     1. The game is well balanced in  every aspect.     2. Tons and tons and tons of weapons and armor.     3. Visually it quite nice, but of course it's not Crysis 3 quality.     4. Personally, after having played 200+ hours, I still find DD enjoyable.Cons     1. Unless you buy the dlc packs, you have (in my opinion) less than half of the full experience of  playing DD. having said that, you can buy all of the dlc and the game for $50 which I wish I had done when I originally bought the game.     2. Aside from the dlc, my only other complaint is that having some sort of tower characterization would be really neat and would add another level of strategy to the game. Summary: Dungeon Defenders is a very fun and easy to learn game that can be taken seriously with all of your friends spending the weekend with their computers, playing DD nonstop and kicking some goblin butt, or coming home after work or school and enjoying a relaxing hour of also kicking some goblin butt.

												I seriously miss this game. I would have loved to see where it would have been today. All this game is now, is a few players with modded weapons playing on modded maps for no reason. I miss the days when this game was in it's prime and it was actually fun to play.Just another fantastic game gone to waste. R.I.P. Dungeon Defeners ~ December 15th, 2010 - June 15th, 2014			"

												Dungeon Defenders is a overall fun and addicting game with friends, It's very much alike with the sanctum series. I dearly love both series and continue to play them to this dayPros- Great Gameplay- Unique Classes (Excluding DLC)- Many different maps and bosses and enemies so a good playabily valueCons- It's boring playing solo (I recommend getting friends to play this with you it's more rewarding)- Most of the dlc classes are reskin of the original classes- - It may get repetitive while playing for a while you know wave goes monster come kill monster protect crystal but it gives more a challenge at the higher levels YOU HAVE TO DEFEND 3 CRYSTALS!!!! 3!!!! It's hard man try it yourself....My rating: 8/10Cons aside, It's still a very good game with high replay value.			"

												Before start if you are wondering which you should buy:  Dungeon Defenders 1 or Dungeon Defenders 2. I will recommend you to buy Dungeon Defenders 1 because Dungeon Defenders 2 doesnt have much content at the moment (March 1 2015) Dungeon Defenders 2 is get to level 25 and farm for legendary gear(Dungeon Defenders 2 is on alpha).Perfect game that let you build defenses how you want also you can put the stats where you want (for make a tower character or DPS character) which is really helpful i really recommend this game my favorite game so far. But it has one problem, which you can evade but sometimes you need to know about this game.The problem is the 99% of the events and best gear is hacked but they try to make it look legit or they just farm good gear duplicate it and sell it but usually the hacked gear is for level 83-100 but theres also  of all levels but thats quite  obvious because damage is 1 billion and stats are all 849 (add me and send me a message if you need help with gear or post it on dungeon defenders forums on: forums/trading/Item Check Thread and ask for item check                                                                       (  https://www.dungeondefenders.com/1/forum/11/trading  )).I have 600+ hours here and i started to get quite bored because ive already done everything but ive seen people with 1k+ hours and they still enoy it, the community is 7/10 because most are hackers or they kick you from games or they just insult you but most of the people is helpful, farming can get annoying doing the map over and over again but when you are high level almost everything is afkable so its fine (i had never found farming annoying but ive seen people getting mad of not getting a good weapon)Also theres some dlc's you should not buy like the skins and the valentines day dlc but if you want to go for all achievements buy valentines day dlc (valentines day have 2 maps which are pain in the♥♥♥♥♥the most annoying maps of all game) but should try and get all dlc's or it wont be as fun as it should.9/10 but if you are able to evade hacking as much as possible 10/10(read other reviews since i didnt covered 100% of the game)			"

												This is the kind of game where, at some point, your equipment has a much larger impact on your character than the choices you made while leveling up. So past a certain point, it becomes far less about character development and more about grinding the perfect weapon/familiar.It's enjoyable up to that point, but please spare yourself the absolute headache of Nightmare difficulty. Early in the game's life, hackers created some truly absurd pieces of equipment and never got banned for it. Instead, what Trendy Entertainment did was ACCOMMODATE these awful things by spiking up the difficulty of new content. So ♥♥♥♥ 'em.Otherwise, it is fun. Like all co-op games, always play it with friends, but in this case don't go too deep. You will be disappointed if you do.			"

												Greetings defenders or potential defenders,I really enjoyed this game. It is one of my favorites.You are a little hero like an apprentice, knight monk or huntress and have to defend the Eternia Crystals from the evil force in level-based towerdeffense roleplay. The mechanics and uniqueness of each hero and the combination of all are the key to victory. For example, the kobolds are running straight to your crystal and you have an apprentice and your friend a monk. You can easily build a blockade to buy time for the monk to summon an electric aura which shocks the kobolds to death. Well done little hero!With killing enemies and winning levels you can earn weapons or armor, which ups the damage of your electric aura or the durabilty of your spike blockades. Also your character can level up to become stronger. To make it a solo game too, you have before every wave a build phase, where you can build your towers and change to other characters, but the game is best played with a friend. For all who do not have one, you can also join random games or search in the community for friends.My biggest problem with the game is the fact, that the game can not played that good without DLCs. While some DLCs just add new characters and levels, some of them are needed to get some levels, so i would buy just the original game or directly all DLCs, so you really know, that you do not buy something you cannot reach without annother DLC. Another good fact about the producer studio is, that EVERY dlc is free for the fist 2 weaks after publication and that is definitly a thing you should support with buying this game.All in all I really recommend this game to all RPG and Towerdeffense fans, because it combines both genres perfectly in an awesome comic style game with a nice community and a modding system.

												Rating: 8.5/10Overview: Third Person Tower Defense The Good:+ Bright colorful graphics. + The amount of enemies, towers, special effects, heroes on screen is amazing.   + Variety of heroes each with their own towers and abilities. As you level up you can spend stat points on health, damage, tower damage, rate of fire etc. You can build characters more suited for building towers or heroes more focused on  dealing damage. + lots of items to customize your hero + 26 maps (with all dlc)  + 49 challenges (with all dlc). Some of the more basic challenges include no towers, harder enemies, etc. Surprisingly many of the challenges are pretty unique and are a lot of fun to play if you ever get bored of the standard tower  defence game.  + Successfully combines tower defense and action rpg. + Every map in the game has 5 difficulty levels, in addition to hardcore mode option - if your hero dies during combat you have to wait for the round to be over before you respawn. Pure Strategy option - You can only use towers to defeat  the level. Survival mode - Fight wave after wave of enemies.  + Controller support although it is much more preferable to play with keyboard and mouse. + Healthy online multiplayer community. Everybody I played with were friendly and helpful.  The Average:The difficulty especially with solo play is odd, The first round is usually the hardest because you have to run around and set up your towers properly. On harder difficulty levels you have a time limit to do this making things even  harder. However once you make it past the first few rounds the game because incredibly easy almost to the point where you no longer have to do anything.   The game features plenty of items to equip. The problem however is that items are grouped into specific character level restrictions in order to equip them. Many of the more powerful and useful items can only be equip at level 74 and  above.   Some of the multiplayer games can be boring especially if there are overpowered people playing. The Bad:- Achievements can only be collect online. The good news however is that you can still play solo by setting up a private match. The bad news...you just played for over one hour fighting wave after wave of enemies. One more wave and you  will finally get the achievement you always wanted.....finally the moment arrives.....connection lost..... ConclusionThis game features a staggering amount of content, you could easily play this game for hundreds of hours if you are really into tower defense games. This game does a lot of creative things with the tower defense genre and it is a lot of fun to play especially with other people.			"

												It's hard to put into words what genre this game is or really what the game is.  It has RPG elements, strong tower defense elements, and some MOBA/DOTA style elements.   It's also an amazing and fun game.You'll have access to four unique classes initially, though DLC unlocks a number more.   Each has their own play style for not just their towers but also their actual fighting.   This means you can enjoy a lot of replay value out of it, as you find different ways to beat the various maps on the higher difficulties with different kits.Additionally, you can swap characters between waves of enemies.  So once you grow your character pool, you can solo content on difficulties you would normally want a group for by just setting up defenses as a wider spread of classes.I've sank around 220 hours into this game and had a blast playing it.

												I'm not sure why a ton of my friends told me to play this. It's like sanctom accept you have to level up and♥♥♥♥♥♥before you can use ANYTHING you need to have >100 hours before you can be high enough to do anything. If you somebody like me, who doesn't like games that sarry your items and levels from world to world, i.e Teraria and Starbound, then you won't want to play this. If you're not good at games then this is for you, because it takes 0 skill just 100 hours of leveling. Once your high enough level you have litterally 100,000,000 dps 120 million is the highest I've ever seen.P.S if you want to get a free perfect game, just get this and power level with some people with 300 hours.P.S.S WHY IS IT $15???

												Rating: 8.5/10Overview: Third Person Tower Defense The Good:+ Bright colorful graphics. + The amount of enemies, towers, special effects, heroes on screen is amazing.   + Variety of heroes each with their own towers and abilities. As you level up you can spend stat points on health, damage, tower damage, rate of fire etc. You can build characters more suited for building towers or heroes more focused on  dealing damage. + lots of items to customize your hero + 26 maps (with all dlc)  + 49 challenges (with all dlc). Some of the more basic challenges include no towers, harder enemies, etc. Surprisingly many of the challenges are pretty unique and are a lot of fun to play if you ever get bored of the standard tower  defence game.  + Successfully combines tower defense and action rpg. + Every map in the game has 5 difficulty levels, in addition to hardcore mode option - if your hero dies during combat you have to wait for the round to be over before you respawn. Pure Strategy option - You can only use towers to defeat  the level. Survival mode - Fight wave after wave of enemies.  + Controller support although it is much more preferable to play with keyboard and mouse. + Healthy online multiplayer community. Everybody I played with were friendly and helpful.  The Average:The difficulty especially with solo play is odd, The first round is usually the hardest because you have to run around and set up your towers properly. On harder difficulty levels you have a time limit to do this making things even  harder. However once you make it past the first few rounds the game because incredibly easy almost to the point where you no longer have to do anything.   The game features plenty of items to equip. The problem however is that items are grouped into specific character level restrictions in order to equip them. Many of the more powerful and useful items can only be equip at level 74 and  above.   Some of the multiplayer games can be boring especially if there are overpowered people playing. The Bad:- Achievements can only be collect online. The good news however is that you can still play solo by setting up a private match. The bad news...you just played for over one hour fighting wave after wave of enemies. One more wave and you  will finally get the achievement you always wanted.....finally the moment arrives.....connection lost..... ConclusionThis game features a staggering amount of content, you could easily play this game for hundreds of hours if you are really into tower defense games. This game does a lot of creative things with the tower defense genre and it is a lot of fun to play especially with other people.			"

												Greetings defenders or potential defenders,I really enjoyed this game. It is one of my favorites.You are a little hero like an apprentice, knight monk or huntress and have to defend the Eternia Crystals from the evil force in level-based towerdeffense roleplay. The mechanics and uniqueness of each hero and the combination of all are the key to victory. For example, the kobolds are running straight to your crystal and you have an apprentice and your friend a monk. You can easily build a blockade to buy time for the monk to summon an electric aura which shocks the kobolds to death. Well done little hero!With killing enemies and winning levels you can earn weapons or armor, which ups the damage of your electric aura or the durabilty of your spike blockades. Also your character can level up to become stronger. To make it a solo game too, you have before every wave a build phase, where you can build your towers and change to other characters, but the game is best played with a friend. For all who do not have one, you can also join random games or search in the community for friends.My biggest problem with the game is the fact, that the game can not played that good without DLCs. While some DLCs just add new characters and levels, some of them are needed to get some levels, so i would buy just the original game or directly all DLCs, so you really know, that you do not buy something you cannot reach without annother DLC. Another good fact about the producer studio is, that EVERY dlc is free for the fist 2 weaks after publication and that is definitly a thing you should support with buying this game.All in all I really recommend this game to all RPG and Towerdeffense fans, because it combines both genres perfectly in an awesome comic style game with a nice community and a modding system.

												Honest Review: I bought this game because it looked fun, I must say I had some fun with it until I realised how corrupt and ruined their ranked servers are by cheaters with hacked gear. Fair enough, you can avoid any other person and just play on your own, but as we all know it's more fun with other players.What's worst is if you buy items from another player ingame or they simply drop an item for you, if that item is not a legitimate item then you risk being punished for it. Yes, TrendyNet have no real way of securing their game or servers... I mean server sided items would be logical and stuff but nope. If you have hacked items knowingly or not, you risk being banned.They even had a forum thread where you could post screenshots and details of items to find out if they were legit. If they weren't, you were simply told to destroy the item. Despite losing millions of mana you probably spent weeks saving to buy it. Millions?! You'd actually be lucky because anyone with half a brain cell can easily hack this flawed game even mana is hacked so people trade by the billions in mana tokens. So the chances of playing this game fairly and getting anywhere is fairly difficult.End of it all, the game becomes rather linear and boring in the end. If you managed to get it on sale like 75% or 85% off like I did, yeah it would be okay for a few hours or days of fun but don't expect anything long term. At the full price I would advise anyone honestly to stay clear of this game.These are my honest and personal opinions of the game which I have obtained through witnessing and playing the game myself. I'm not one to condone or encourage or even cheat / hack on a game which is why I refuse to play this game any more.I put it down to a very limited amount of enjoyment before realising the end game is completely ruined.If you still like the idea of buying a game you have to salvage all the way to ensure all your gear is legit then go for it, personally I don't think this company deserve your money until they are prepared to implement a real anti-hack system / feature. So I would have to recommend you do not buy this game.My honest opinions from an honest gamer. What you decide to do is your own choice :)			"

												I used to play a lot of Tower Defense maps when I played Warcraft III. (both Reign of Chaos and Frozen Throne) I found it highly entertaining, yet it sometimes became repetitive with the snap-to-grid build locations. A few years have passed since I last touched Warcraft III, but my love for Tower Defense games never faded. I would always have at least one or two on my iPhone.Then one day I met Dungeon Defenders.Not only do you have the freedom to build your towers or traps nearly everywhere on the map; you have your own Hero that you can control and engage in combat. Each Hero has their own types of Towers and Abilities, making the fun for a wide variety of people. The best part of this game is, you don't have the fight the waves of monsters alone. You can bring 3 friends with you to defend the Eternia Crystals. I highly recommend this game, even if don't know much about Tower Defense, because you can spend your skill points on your Hero itself, instead of the towers.Always be sure to look at some gameplay before you consider purchasing, it can make or break your decision to buy it.

												The good: - Well-balanced hybrid TD concept for once - the towers don't unconditionally do 95% of the damage. - Classes that /are actually unique classes/ and not just rearrangement of stats. - Decent control schemes. - Multiplayer works well and is useful. - Graphics are impressive, if a little cartoony. - Music is actually very good. - No horrible D2 voiceacting. - Overabundance of possible strategies.The bad: - Wacky stat system that scales out of control and caps in so many places it's confusing. - Horribly broken levelling system that serves only as a redundant, ""you're not getting to the endgame THAT quickly"" obstacle. - Poor item comparison interface that almost eliminates any reason to check non-direct upgrades. - Aggravatingly unncessary numbers of enemies in the endgame that cause incredible framerate drops. - Tutorials are class-specific and will not teach you the unique usage of other classes. - Poor option configurability that ocassionally refuses to even save. - Annoying interface elements(An ogre has arrived! An ogre has arrived! An ogre has arrived! An ogre has arrived!). - Unfriendly IM-chat system that sits smack in the middle of the screen with no history. - Multiplayer tends to eliminate challenge sometimes. - Heavily DLC-based.			"

												With ""679 hrs on record"", I can vouch for this being a super-addictive game. A basic play through on the default difficulty actually doesn't take that long. Nightmare mode on the other hand is damned near impossible. Even if you do manage it, you'll probably feel compelled to do it better next time. That's what kept me playing: trying to obtain the ultimate defense.The game is Tower Defense crossed with 3rd Person Shooter. As you level up you can choose to increase the stats of either your hero or towers, or maybe a bit of both. Increasing stat points along with loads of unique item drops, the possibility of two characters having the same configuration are slim to none. There is now also a PvP arena, so you can test out the metal of your uniquely configured hero.The negative side to Dungeon Defenders is that it's ""secure"" ranked server really isn't secure at all. You'll sometimes encounter players who have gear with impossibly high stats that are clearly hacked. I've reported several hackers and scammers to Trendy myself but they don't seem too concerned with the problem. Most likely because they're now focused on Dungeon Defenders 2, which is sadly nothing like the first game.. (it's a DOTA clone).------------------Edit:Dungeon Defenders Eternity Edition is now out. It's much more secure as most things are now done server side instead of locally.  I strongly advise that you purchase the Eternity edition over this one. "

												I have a love for Tower Defense games. That said, Dungeon Defenders didn’t do anything for me, and I largely suspect it’s because of its extremely grindy nature. I can respect that some people will like this game – I’m not saying that it’s bad or that I disagree with the design principles or anything – I just didn’t like how long it would take to get anywhere substantial. I personally didn’t like it, so I’m going to not recommend it, but that’s no reflection on the quality of the game, merely how I personally enjoyed it. I also dislike the amount of DLC they have for it -- I don't have a dislike of DLC in general, but literall 25 DLC is too much for a game...not to mention the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Dev conditions in which they worked.

												The good: - Well-balanced hybrid TD concept for once - the towers don't unconditionally do 95% of the damage. - Classes that /are actually unique classes/ and not just rearrangement of stats. - Decent control schemes. - Multiplayer works well and is useful. - Graphics are impressive, if a little cartoony. - Music is actually very good. - No horrible D2 voiceacting. - Overabundance of possible strategies.The bad: - Wacky stat system that scales out of control and caps in so many places it's confusing. - Horribly broken levelling system that serves only as a redundant, ""you're not getting to the endgame THAT quickly"" obstacle. - Poor item comparison interface that almost eliminates any reason to check non-direct upgrades. - Aggravatingly unncessary numbers of enemies in the endgame that cause incredible framerate drops. - Tutorials are class-specific and will not teach you the unique usage of other classes. - Poor option configurability that ocassionally refuses to even save. - Annoying interface elements(An ogre has arrived! An ogre has arrived! An ogre has arrived! An ogre has arrived!). - Unfriendly IM-chat system that sits smack in the middle of the screen with no history. - Multiplayer tends to eliminate challenge sometimes. - Heavily DLC-based.			"

												Back when I was on Windows 7, this game was awesome. I spent a lot of time completing the main campaign and challenges and leveled up a lot of characters of all classes. Some of the updates back in the day sort of put me off, and I stopped playing it. Now, fast forward a few years. This game was not even in the back of my mind when I switched to Ubuntu. I saw that the game was getting the Rising Phoenix update. Awesome! Come to find out that the CDT (Community Development Team) took over updates for the game! Even better! After not playing for a few years, I installed it and played it. Not only did the Rising Phoenix update not come to the Linux version, but the same bugs and mis-features are still present that has been plaguing the Mac and Linux version for years, as evident by the warnings on the  PC Gaming Wiki page [pcgamingwiki.com], which quite frankly should be present on the store page.  With all the reports of a dying player base, and Mac/Linux players being left in the dust, stay far away from this one, even on sale. Glad I enjoyed it during its golden days. Shame on you, Trendy.

												This is one of the best action tower defense games out there! This game mixes tower defense, third person action, and rpg elements and they all fit together perfectly. Choose from many different heroes who all play differently from eachother then start going through wave after wave of enemies as you gather better equipment and level your hero. Dump points into tower defense, or your heroes powers or balance the two. The RPG and loot system has you coming back for more and the added coop play is perfect for playing with friends or meeting new friends playing with other people. You won't be dissapointed in this game and it is worth all the money I paid.			"

												Dungeon Defenders is a moderately fun distraction, but only with friends. The gear-and-level based community is about as friendly as the developers are trustworthy. With stolen designs from multiple games and ripping off artists that did work for the game, it shows, with a haphazard, overly cartoonish and unpolished design. Still, some people might enjoy the visual style, which I could only handle barely. The redeeming qualities lie in mowing down tons of bad guys, but really... there are too many cons to this game. The constant (almost every day) updates, the endless DLC(which i personally find to be way too expensive for their underwhelming payoff) and repetetion leaves a lot to be desired, but in the end, it's a like-it-or-not title. 5/10			"

												It starts out fine, but once you hit level 40 the game turns into a boring grindfest because the devs thought that spamming loads of enemies with masses of HP was a good way to make the game scale in difficulty.Then it becomes a grindfest to find the best weapons so you can beat the challenges to get rewards in the form psudo-random better gear and more challenges unlocked. It's a vicious cycle of sitting around and at those points in the game it can take 3 hours to beat a level and most of the time spent is watching TV/netflix/hulu/whateer holding LMB pointed at the enemy spawn while you wait for the audio cues warning that an ogre or boss has spawned, you take care of them, and go back to shooting the mobspawn.Ultimatly, the game tried to be too many things at once and doesn't do any of them particularly great, it was simply one of the first well-known games to place its landmark on the 3rd person shooter/1st person shooter - towerdefense combo genera.

After reading through the actual court case docs I can honestly say that I will NEVER purchase from or support trendy in the future.  Moneygrab lawsuits are only used by garbage companies who attempt to gain power on the competetive plain rather than the creative one.

												Dungeon defender is a good game. I like to play as the monk lee sin. His special tower are energy field that either deals damage over time or slow, weakens or put salts on the enemy. There are also Vayne, Veigar  and Garen as playable characters. Garen is a knight that uses medieval technology to rekt his enemies. vaynes use trap and veigar uses dark gypsie magic. Overall I give this game a 10 out of 10 out of 10  because the graphic is beautiful in it's own way. The uhh, only thing that I don't like about the game is that the storyline kinda suck and it's not very rewarding. like -spoiler alert- After you kill the evil dragon alduin the heroes just look off into the distance and I was like ""What the hell are they looking at? their dead mentors?"" because that was the most anti climatic ends ever. But, it's redeeming quality is the gameplay and that's where it's really shine. You defend this crystal thing that you can customize from the enemies/ "

												First off, I'm not that kind of person that can write deep meaningful reviews, in fact, this is my very first one, but I do believe the amount of ingame hours can speak for my words here.So, this game... great choice for those who like tower defence genre, with extra rpg elements and item grinding, which may not be the cup of tea for everyone, as at some point it becomes necessary, but it offers replayability for those who enjoy hunting for better gear. Looking at the game at the moment, its further development was handled from the Trendy developers to a community team, so it's expected to get some new fresh content to even more expand the game. Overall, very addictive and enjoyable game, and for the price as it is listed, worth the investment.However due to how old this game is, its active playerbase is slowly fading, so it may be difficult to find company at times in multiplayer. And also, to experience the full potential of this game, it requires acquiring most of the DLCs along with this game. These are the only cons I could think about.			"

												Oh how i loved this game. It was my true love... It just felt... Right.... but then... Oneday a horrible thing happened.... DD2!! Yeah once DD2 came out they totally droped this game. This was one of the best games i have ever played, Enough characters and dlc to keep you playing for a long time, And even with the dlc characters it's still not pay to win. All the characters are blanced and its well made maps add for more tower defence action! This really stood out to me because i love tower defence games, And this was not only a well made tower defence game but you can help your towers in battle yourself. But now adays this game isnt fun, They killed multiplayer and the game is dead. I guess you can play single player, But this is the type of game that the fun is multiplyed by a million when played with friends. So saddly, And it pains me to do this, I cant recomend this game unless they fix it.			"

												This FPS has it's up and it's down. The difficulty skyrockets after setting it from easy to normal, which is terrible difficulty curve mechanics on the developers parts. Add the fact that people who can play on normal just hoard all of the loot to themselves in a pinch-penny fashion. Us easy players can't get anywhere if the normal players can't share the loot.All in all however, at least there's a neat pet simulator, which competes with TF2's on par hat simulator.I'll give it a green/blue rating.

												I've played around 2,000 hours of this game on my XBOX-360 and I have to say the game is really a great game, but I feel the devs of the 2 Dungeon Defenders are starting to slack a bit. I mean seriously, you released the game to be compatable with OSX as well as Windows and you can't even get to the menu for Mac. I wanted to play the game so badly because I loved it so much in the past I downloaded it on my Mac for $15 but I could'nt even get to the main menu. Also resently I'v come to deslike one of my most favored developer group out there, but I don't like how your treating your former-employees that are now working on Ark: Survival Game. Instead you should be cheering them on for their great efforts. Please.....Please add Mac support.Thanks-Penumbra			"

												Probably one of the best towerdefense games out there.  A bit grindy, but a game with lot's of replay value.  Later in the life of the game, hacks became so ubiquitous that the item economy is wrecked with no way for an entry player to get decent gear.  Now, it's a game no one plays anymore.Enter Dungeon Defenders Eternity to move to a third party secure server model to prevent cheating.  It's really the game they should have made in the first place, but now you get the privelege of paying for it again!  Just buy dungeon defenders eternity.			"

												When I got Dungeon Defenders it was a fun hybrid tower defense game that was rather unbalanced at high levels. Since then it has turned into a monster that has little resemblance to what it started at and none of the fun. Now it is all the worst parts and none of the good. The sequel looks even worse. Do not buy this game.			"

												Waste of your time. Endless mode is boring as hell and there is no real end-game goal besides making your char even more ridiculous. You will have unlocked every skill after 5 minutes and from then on there is no change in playstyle. You can't change skills, you will need to level another char. This is not replayvalue, it is a time-sink. There is no synergy between the towers and abilities and the amount of towers and traps which can be placed is laughably low.If you enjoy passive gameplay and have a lot of time to spare (and got 2-3 friends who've got the same problem) then I would recommend you this.However, if you cherish satisfying slaughter of hordes of enemies, interesting levels and fewer limitations on how to equip your character and do the levels, I strongly recommend Orcs Must Die 2. Even without a loot-system, it offers more flexibility, more char customisation and more ways to beat the various levels (which are ten times more varied than these).3/10 would not buy again.			"

												It looks like it could have been a good game.  Maybe there are too many DLCs or a single which has/have broken the game.  There's a lot of grinding and standing around doing nothing while you level up.  In fact that was how I spent most of the time playing the game.  There was very little thought going into playing.It takes too many hours to level up to play the highest levels, where things may get interesting.			"

												Got this in a humble bundle for like five bucks with all DLC. Definitely not worth more than that, certainly not the total of $65 it costs right now. Game is incredibly poorly optimized. Several endgame maps just do not run well at all, non-hosts get unplayable rubberbanding and monster/damage lag. Every map uses basically the same strategy and requires you to have endgame geared copies of all the heroes. Grind is absolutely absurd. All drops are pure RNG, all stats/values are randomized. There aren't minimum threshholds so look forward to getting a bunch of terrible godly (lv 60) gear on lategame NMHC survivals that need 10x the stats as the gear they drop. If you can get it for pocket change its alright for that, but its not worth anywhere near the price on steam.			"

												READ IF YOU ARE TRYING TO DECIDE BETWEEN DD1 AND DD2!Ignore my hours because i've played this for countless hours on consoles as well. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE FRIENDS WHO WILL PLAY IT WITH YOU. This game is very basic and will get VERY boring if you just play it alone. It took me a couple hours to get a character from lv 1-73 alone and then after just a day I felt like I was running through this game too quickly, but once I went Online with some friends it was like an entirely new game. My friends and I have spent countless hours on console and on PC blasting away wave after wave of enemies, upgrading, learning new strategies and just goofing off. If you are looking for some hardcore MMO style game, then this is NOT for you. If you enjoy a casual rpg that you can play with friends then look no further. IF YOU ARE HAVING A HARD TIME DECIDING BETWEEN DD1 or DD2 or DD:Eternity , STAY AWAY FROM DD2 and Eternity , just buy this one. DD2 is a complete nightmare and is heading no where, that game is a complete train wreck. DD: Eternity is a terrible money grab, sneakily released by the devs to make more money, it is exactly the same as DD1 but has a terrible amount of bugs and problems and when the devs realised this they abandoned the game and did not finish it. Just stick with DD1! It's your best bet of the series and the only game of the series worth buying!			"

												This game was really addictive...Lots of Hack and Slash action mixed with RPG elements (leveling, attributes, equipment sets, different armor and weapons, different qualities for armor and weapons...) and a good example of what the Tower Defense genre is all about...Sadly, the developers created many problems for endgame, with 3 hours+ grinds that can effectively give you completely useless stuff. The random attributes range for the best equipment start from MINUS (...yes, negative attributes), and for a game that expands it's longevity on top of equipment grinding... it's one unforgivable mistake.Avoid like the plague, or at least avoid the awfully balanced Nightmare Mode.

												Dungeon Defenders is a game that I developed a love-hate relationship with. On one hand, it's a class-based multiplayer action RPG with tower defense elements and is a lot of fun to play with friends of similar levels. However the game has many elements which tend to be detrimental to the experience. For one thing, the game is very grind-heavy. Whether you're getting new gear, or gaining a new level, or trying to get a really obscure achievement for a rare pet, the grind will make you feel like you're playing a Chinese MMO. Second, the sheer amount of player levels means unless all players are the same level, someone will feel like one is carrying the other. Third, much of the content of the game is locked behind so much DLC that it would give Train Simulator a run for its money. Fourth, the game is not very fun playing solo and you cannot even get achievements solo unless you play online.Dungeon Defenders is a really huge timesink, and I know plenty of gamers who enjoy that, but at the end of day I never felt a sense of real accomplishment despite the sheer amount of ""progression"" I made in my characters. At higher levels I grew bored with the sheer monotony of the game, watching my towers decimate entire rows of bad guys who only know how to march like lemmings over and over again. In the end, I found the action-oriented nature of Orcs Must Die and Orcs Must Die 2 to be far more fulfilling for my tastes.			"

												I regret this purchase.  Do not spend your money on this game.   While the game is fun, if my friends and I spend more than 1 man hour trying to figure out how to play together, ♥♥♥♥ the game.  We'll move onto something where you can simply click ""play with friends"".  We did figure it out, but only after being stubborn to make it work.  This kind of interface flaw should be addressed.  It's a really god damn simple solution to facilitate inviting friends from the create online game menu.  Why they chose to ignore it?  No ♥♥♥♥ing clue. So, if you have no friends IRL and only like to play online with strangers or alone, this is the game for you.			"

												/Edit. My review used to be negative. I had lost all of my characters seemingly for no reason. A while after I wrote this review another steam user told me in the comments that the same thing had happened to them and that they fixed it with support. (Thanks Rain!:) They showed me where to contact support and after contacting them they quickly restored my lost stuff. The reason I lost my stuff was that I played on a mac and a PC. This is the first negative review I have written. At first I really enjoyed this game, liking the gameplay a great deal. I WOULD have written a positive review for this game. But let me explain: One day I logged in on my mac (Yeah I have a mac) and found all my characters were gone. I quit the game and later logged on my PC and all my progress was gone on both. I did a little research and Trendy Net would once have done something about this, but the team responsible for manually reinstating characters was gotten rid of, because of Dungeon Defenders 2 and cost. I was not very high level and I could get back there, but what if it happened again? This is a fun game but you could lose all you characters.			"

												Already after just playing a mere 2 hours of the game I can say that I'm in love with it. I mean who could ever imagine YOU actually being part of a tower defense game?! To be honest while just playing the first level I got hooked on the game and addicted. It's almost like a dream come through for most tower defense players. I would say that the majority of people who buy this game will be extremely satisfied. Even better if you're planning on buying the game after the date of my post, you can be happy to see that this game has recently gotten compatibility with workshop. But I do recommend that you play this game with a friend or more, just because it might get to hard to play some levels, and the fact that the game was designed to accomadate you and up to 4 friends. But this game is straight up awesome and addicting.			"

												It's over four years old now, and some of the newer TD games are a bit faster paced, but it's still a very solid 3rd person TD game with hundreds of hours of content so long as the player doesn't skip ahead by purchasing items from other player's shops or getting power-leveled.The only significant problems with it are related to the recent patches which the player community has been involved in.  -- First, the MAC and Linux versions still haven't been updated after many months, so they can't play with people who use the Windows version anymore.  Hopefully, that'll eventually be solved, but we've seen no progress there yet.-- Second, when bugs are introduced, it takes months for them to be solved.So, as long as you're on Windows, and you don't mind a bug here or there, the current version of the game is great.

												I consider this to be a great time sinker where there are almost infinite things to do with all the toons you can play and the leveling/gear system.It is addictive in that regard and playing with friends is very rewarding. You will need synergy between towers and damage toons in order to achieve victory. The only issue I have with the game is that high levels constantly join and ruin the game for lower levels, they turn the game into a bore fest by one shotting everything over and over. 8/10			"

												I'm not a fan of the egregious amount of DLC in this game.  I would have gladly payed a 25$ or more price tag, if it means I get all the content.  When you load up the game and it shoves in your face the fact that your missing 5 PAGES of DLC, you wonder what you really got for your money when it seems like 80% of the content is now behind DLC.  Aside from that, the game is clunky and unintuitive.  The clarity of the interface screens and the in-game battle are atrocious, and there are almost NO tooltips to speak of.

												At first, it looked to very fun and enjoyable, but it gets boring very quickly. The reason why its so boring is because you do the exact same thing over again, you build defenses to order to protect the crystal. I played this with no other friends and it gets boring. If you're going to get this game, play it with friends because the singleplayer is just not that fun. Its only fun in singleplayer if you're a find of grinds. Some other problems with the game are stupid design choices. For example, I'm playing on normal difficulty, in the build phase, and playing as squire. During the build phase you walk around and build defenses, simple right? Its not so simple when your character moves at 2 mph. I guess they made it like this for the harder difficulties where you are timed in building stuff. When your playing on normal however, your not timed, instead you have all the time in the world to build defenses. So why then does your character move at half-speed, doesn't make sense. Antoher problem is that to start the wave, you have to go ALL the way back to the cystal. Why can't we do it remotely?I guess they made it like this to make it more ""challenging"" but to me, I find annoying. For all these reason combined I couldn't recommend this game. Only get this game if you can play with friends or you are a fan of grinds. So glad I got this game during a sale...			"

When I first started the game it was online and it wasn'f as enjoyable because I get kicked at times. So paranoia set aside. I just love the fact I can plug 2 xbox controllers and let me brothers join in during co-op. We really do work out as a team and play different characters with unique Defense traps. P.S. If anyone wants to suggest which Dlc purchases that I should get.... And the reason why I should get it. That would be extremely helpful! ^_^ Thank you for reading ~			"

												Game wasn't bad but the developers sued a former worker for making a successful game... ie they chose to steal from the Ark dev team. To that end, I deleted it off my games list so I do not have to see this on my list anymore. I will never ever support sue happy developers. You ruin the industry with that kind of action.			"

												At first, it looked to very fun and enjoyable, but it gets boring very quickly. The reason why its so boring is because you do the exact same thing over again, you build defenses to order to protect the crystal. I played this with no other friends and it gets boring. If you're going to get this game, play it with friends because the singleplayer is just not that fun. Its only fun in singleplayer if you're a find of grinds. Some other problems with the game are stupid design choices. For example, I'm playing on normal difficulty, in the build phase, and playing as squire. During the build phase you walk around and build defenses, simple right? Its not so simple when your character moves at 2 mph. I guess they made it like this for the harder difficulties where you are timed in building stuff. When your playing on normal however, your not timed, instead you have all the time in the world to build defenses. So why then does your character move at half-speed, doesn't make sense. Antoher problem is that to start the wave, you have to go ALL the way back to the cystal. Why can't we do it remotely?I guess they made it like this to make it more ""challenging"" but to me, I find annoying. For all these reason combined I couldn't recommend this game. Only get this game if you can play with friends or you are a fan of grinds. So glad I got this game during a sale...			"

												When this game first came out it was one of my favorites ever.  The stratedgy portion of defense building was amazingly fun.  Once they began to create charactors that could push aside or completely bypass the defenses the game became extremely dissapointing.  No more stratedgy involved :(  Then there was the fiasco with DD2 where it was scheduled to release spring of 2014 and was listed as such on their website until the fall of 2014 when they decided to completely change the game.  Trendy has definitely turned me off to their games.			"

												A really engaging and active tower defense game. While you don't get many toys to play with (5 ""towers"" per character plus 2 skills), the character depth comes from how you upgrade your stats. Most of the difficulty comes from tower placement and is easier to read than most tower defense games. Thankfully since there are fewer turrets than normal when you lose a map you aren't left thinking ""should I have used the flamethrower turret or the spinning blades?"" Although it seems simple/boring at first, there is always something to do on later maps; whether you are upgrading/replacing/repairing turrets or tanking/sniping/aoeing waves of mobs down, everyone is always doing something.I would recommend this over similar titles (like Sanctum) because of the large amount of maps, diversity of game modes, hero flexibility and customization, and non-rage inducing difficulty.

												10/10.  I've put over 300 hours in this game, and I keep coming back to it.  It is a tower defense and a first person shooter smashed together.  Similar to Orcs Must die.  It has 4 levels of difficulty and 12 base maps in the campaign plus a ton of bonus maps and challenges.  The graphics are cartoon like but 3D and the style fits very well.  The maps are fun to run around and of course as with any tower defense the goal is to find out how to layout your towers and use your playable character to keep the monsters from getting to your protection point (the crytals).  There is a multi-player mode, but I mainly played by myself, and with another friend who turned me on to this.  Picked it up through the humble bundle with all the DLC, but it would have been worth it at full price.			"

												Well, I have decided to support Trendy Entertainment by buying the original ""Dungeon Defenders"" since I've been thoroughly enjoying the free-to-play ""Dungeon Defenders II""! I'm GLAD I did this, because the original ""Dungeon Defenders"" is at LEAST as fun as ""Dungeon Defenders II""!Oh, and I REALLY like the fact that you have an option to play this game OFFLINE!I heartily recommend ""Dungeon Defenders"" over the ""Orcs Must Die!"" series! Especially ""OMD!2"", which PENALIZES players for using mods (even though that game has a Steam Workshop) by refusing to save their progress! That's right, if you play ""Orcs Must Die! 2"" with mods -- even those mods that simply change an outfit or two -- then that game will refuse to save! So ""OMD!2"" with mods is essentially like a glorified Atari 2600 game! For those of you who don't know, the Atari 2600 was an ANCIENT gaming console that had NO way of saving the player's progress AT ALL! But then again, this was because Atari 2600 games were mostly arcade-style games, anyway. And also because it was a console that was first introduced in the late 1970's. The following article explains the Atari 2600 better than I can in this review: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600Ergo ipso facto: stay AWAY from the ""Orcs Must Die!"" series and get this game instead! You'll be glad you did!			"

												Dungeon Defenders is an original hybrid of two hot genres: Tower Defense and online Action-RPG! The game puts players in the role of one of four distinctive hero classes, tasked with fending off hordes of invading beasties by strategically summoning a variety of Defenses & Traps throughout their castle.But as far more than a strategy game, players directly participate in the action-packed combat with their hero characters, while upgrading their statistics, gathering tons of loot and inventory items, customizing & upgrading equipment, and developing unique class abilities. All of this can be enjoyed in seamless online and split-screen local multiplayer, as players cooperate and compete through the story campaign and challenge missions to build the strongest heroes and achieve the highest scores in the kingdom.Combining the depth of strategic gaming with the satisfying action of RPG character building in a beautifully stylized toon fantasy setting, Dungeon Defenders is designed to be a distinctly addictive, easy-to-play experience for casual and hardcore gamers alike.

												This game is the best tower defence game to date, no doubt. It has RPG elements and you can run around the battlefield killing enemies instead of just sitting there looking at a screen while your towers take care of everything. You can have pets and upgrade your weapons and gear exactly how you want to. More projectiles on your weapon or maybe different kinds of damage, etc. It's pretty challenging aswell, but it's really fun if you play with lots of friends.			"

												I remember when this game was first released and tower defense games were lazy time filling flash games. Dungeon defenders expanded exceptionally on the original concept of tower defense.Each level has a number of waves of monsters you must defeat while defending your crystal. Each character has a unique combination of combat stats and defensive units (such as barricades, turrents, auras, etc). Each level in dungeon defenders has a finite number of points you can spend. You must co-ordinate with your team members to decide which strategic points to hold and what combination of defensive units to place.Level design is excellent, and the characters are versatile and interesting.Offline splitscreen multiplayer works well, although I cannot comment on online multiplayer. This game would be very tedius one player, and very hard as the game works best when players compliment each others skill sets.Subscribe to my curator page for more local multiplayer recommendations: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7189360/Check out my Couch Gaming group for specials, bundles, etc: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CGLM "

												This is my favorite game of all time. Dungeon Defenders is a tower defense-ish game. I hate tower defense games because they are rigid in where you can place what towers. Everything is in a grid & only certain types of towers are allowed in certain slots. DD is not at all like that. You are trying to prevent the mobs from destroying your crystal & you use towers and your hero to stop them. That's about where the similarities end. You can place your towers anywhere on the map, facing any direction, in any combinations. You can switch between characters to use towers from the Apprentice & the Squire, for example, but then play on your Monk. You cannot stack towers, but other than that you have nearly complete freedom in how you place towers. You have a maximum number of ""defense units"" with each tower using a particular number of DU to build so you need to be strategic with what towers you'll use where.Unfortunately the later levels are unplayably laggy. The other drawback is that the terrain appears to disappear on the latest waves in the large maps if you have a large group & the host's upload speeds aren't obscenely fast. For my purposes there was still plenty to do in the game other without hitting these bugs.Still, there is a ton of replayability and many, many different goals to work towards depending on your preferences. Increasing the difficulty doesn't feel like you're just doing the same map over & over as the mobs change as you increase difficulty which makes you change your build to handle the new mobs. The story is brief, but fun. The combat is intuitive. The menus are not at all intuitive, until you get used to them. I have never enjoyed a game even half as much as this one.			"

												Well, I have decided to support Trendy Entertainment by buying the original ""Dungeon Defenders"" since I've been thoroughly enjoying the free-to-play ""Dungeon Defenders II""! I'm GLAD I did this, because the original ""Dungeon Defenders"" is at LEAST as fun as ""Dungeon Defenders II""!Oh, and I REALLY like the fact that you have an option to play this game OFFLINE!I heartily recommend ""Dungeon Defenders"" over the ""Orcs Must Die!"" series! Especially ""OMD!2"", which PENALIZES players for using mods (even though that game has a Steam Workshop) by refusing to save their progress! That's right, if you play ""Orcs Must Die! 2"" with mods -- even those mods that simply change an outfit or two -- then that game will refuse to save! So ""OMD!2"" with mods is essentially like a glorified Atari 2600 game! For those of you who don't know, the Atari 2600 was an ANCIENT gaming console that had NO way of saving the player's progress AT ALL! But then again, this was because Atari 2600 games were mostly arcade-style games, anyway. And also because it was a console that was first introduced in the late 1970's. The following article explains the Atari 2600 better than I can in this review: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600Ergo ipso facto: stay AWAY from the ""Orcs Must Die!"" series and get this game instead! You'll be glad you did!			"

												Usually making sequels to games work. In this case, it shattered it completely. Of course people want to see new content, which kept coming out, up to the release of DD2. I put MANY hours into this game because it was new and fun. I liked all the DLC and such, but just quit when they came out with DD2. They should have stuck with the original because they really didn't improve much at all. I would like to recommend this game, but the player base has just dropped because of their sequel. It is really up to you if you want to play. The game its self is great, just wish they hadn't changed it like they did.			"

												A mix between a Tower Defense and an Action-RPG. There are four different heroes to pick and each one can build different towers. As you progress through the levels your hero gains Experience Points, acces to new towers and can level up. You can upgrade your hero's attributes (or those of your towers), there are tons of items and pets which fight for you - all of which you can upgrade at the ""Forge"" in order to make them more powerful and trade them with other players. Dungeon Defensers has a Co-op mode for up to 4 players, 4 difficulty settings, various challenge missions for bonus items and items exclusive to the challenge. There currently are 4 game-modes: CAMPAIGN - normal game, SURVIVAL - endless waves of enemies, PURE STRATEGY - only towers can attack, and MIX MODE which completely randomizes enemy waves when playing survival mode.I had a ton of fun with this game already and really recommend giving it a try if you like the concept of Tower Defense games. There is a DEMO, too!			"

												In Dungeon Defenders, the gameplay is good, as there is a fair bit of hack and slash but also tower defense. Not to mention that hacking this game isn't worth it. It has a good campaign that is not very deep, but the game also is a tower defense, not a blockbuster game like Call Of Duty Black Ops 2. The coop experience allows a whole new experience each time.One time,you may just breeze by it like nothing happened. Amp up the difficulty and you may just escape the hands of death. The difficulty is a good challenge for all players.  Luckily, the DLC is fairly priced.  About 3 dollars for a character with there own skills and fleshes. (i.e. the Summoner) This game suits alot of players. Like, I play summoner because i like the RTS feel of the game. The summoner feels way different than, say, the Knight. different towers,  Skills, and voices.  I would say that the game's cheap little price is well spent.

												In Dungeon Defenders, the gameplay is good, as there is a fair bit of hack and slash but also tower defense. Not to mention that hacking this game isn't worth it. It has a good campaign that is not very deep, but the game also is a tower defense, not a blockbuster game like Call Of Duty Black Ops 2. The coop experience allows a whole new experience each time.One time,you may just breeze by it like nothing happened. Amp up the difficulty and you may just escape the hands of death. The difficulty is a good challenge for all players.  Luckily, the DLC is fairly priced.  About 3 dollars for a character with there own skills and fleshes. (i.e. the Summoner) This game suits alot of players. Like, I play summoner because i like the RTS feel of the game. The summoner feels way different than, say, the Knight. different towers,  Skills, and voices.  I would say that the game's cheap little price is well spent. Those who hack the game and say it sucks just haven't played co-op.  So pick up the game and I'll see you there!			"

												The best game I have ever played in twenty years of computer gaming, bar none (and I have played a LOT of games). Eight years on I can still recall how profoundly that game gripped me, and I am not an overly emotional person. You will care about the characters, you will be moved, you will make choices that tell you more about yourself. It sounds trite, I know, but it really is that good. If only someone would make more of these...insightful, intelligent, devastatingly creative. Fallout is the only RPG to come close. A word of warning: You MUST read all the text, explore all the dialogue options, if you are to gain the most from the game. A decent intelligence and wisdom score is recommended.....although so is a decent score in everything else....the game does the best job of making usually superflous statistics genuinely useful that I have ever seen. Still very much worth playing.			"

												I don't know what the devs have been up to as far as their morals, but the game they made is really solid. You need to think about the towers you place to clear a level. The classes are varied and powerful in different ways (though some are a little better than others, you can get far with any of them). Bigger and more challenging foes are always on the horizon, the RPG mechanics are cool, it's appropriately challenging, and it's even better with friends. I fully intend to get all the DLC and get a level 100 of every class, because I like this game that much. Also there's a gun that shoots chickens.			"

												This is my personal review on Dungeon Defenders The reason why this is negative:OK don't get me wrong I love this game I played it on the PS3 with my brothers and had an amazing time getting new gear and fighting wave after wave of enemies, but I decided to buy it on PC I bought it with all the DLC's and game half off (The DLC's are really good) The game ran perfectly fine on my mom's old sh**ty  laptop and didn't really have any texture Poppins or any visual problems on windows 8! But I got  a new PC and well I upgraded to windows 10. I recently tried to play multiplayer(split screen) with my friend, it did not work basically what happened is the hub did not pop up for either of our characters nor did the menus. There was also some texture Poppin and certain objects in the game would flicker (Single player and multiplayer this happened)Positive part:I can still play the game solo on my main rig and I will only have to deal with the annoying Texture airs. Btw I have a hub in single player and everything is playable. If I want to play multiplayer I can still hook up two controllers to my moms laptop and the experience is acceptable. Ps like I said this game is fantastic WHEN IT WORKS it is one of the best tower defence games I've played and probably is one of my favourites game ever!!!Conclusion: OK so if you have Windows 8 or you're just really lucky this game will probably work and if it does that's awesome because this game is awesome. If any of you out there know what problems I am talking about and could try to explain to me how to fix this problem that would be amazing.Main raid:GTX 107016 gigs of DDR4 RAMi5 6500 3.2 Windows 10			"

												This was a really stupid game that I had an absolute blast playing with friends. It had just enough depth for us to be able to work out how to do well, enough levels of difficulty to be challenging, and was simultaneously casual enough to just jump into and play. It was poorly balanced and had really unpleasant controls; a non-existent story and boring, samey enemies, but to play it with friends not really taking it seriously was huge fun. Totally worth if you have a group to just ♥♥♥♥ around, so like if it's on sale and you can get four copies, totally get it and try it out. But definitely NOT worth full price or playing alone.			"

												Dungeon Defenders is a co-op focused tower defense game where four heroes try to stop huge monster waves from destroying magic crystals by building all kinds of defensive structures such as walls and cannons. There are also some roleplaying and hack & slash elements so players can level up their heroes and fight enemies with swords and spells. The singleplayer side of the game is lacking but the multiplayer mode is always very fun and addicting. Technically the game is quite polished and doesn't have any fatal bugs which is always a good thing.			"

Product received for free
												This is a great game that I believe everyone would love. The art in the game is fun and cartoony which I found amusing. It is pretty easy to get used to the controls. One of the only downsides is that there isn't really a tutorial on how to play, I had to go back the the controls section in the settings to figure stuff out. I found the gameplay to be great, it has a good story and different classes to experiment with. Again, there are downsides to the classes, first off you can't really customize the characters, you are stuck with the default look and if you don't buy the DLCs you are stuck with only four basic classes.(trust me the DLCs are worth it though). So basically this is a great game with a good plot and characters. If you are into defense/strategy games this is for you.(for the best strategic class I recommend the summoner DLC class.)			"

As long as you keep in mind that this is a game to play together with friends, you DON'T need to specialize in placing towers and keeping an eye on them if you don't want to. Giving support to the towers via jumping into the mobs and going snicker-snack on them is also something you'll have to do if you want your partner's towers to survive enough to prove useful. All in all, a game that encourages players with diverging styles to get together and play as a team. Good stuff. (b'.')b			"

												On my radar, there are currently only three major FPS/Tower Defense games out. The first one I experienced was 'Sanctum' (thanks, Stormy!). It was a crazy tower-building game that put you in the middle of all the action-packed craziness, which became even more fun in multiplayer (and I'm one of those that usually likes to play solo). However, it had one major flaw; it seriously lacked content. Though the weapons were interesting enough, the number of maps simply were not. Combined with a limited story, this one ultimately felt a little unfinished. [note: there were several DLC packs including more maps and/or weapons and a comic online somewhere]The next one I tried was 'Orcs Must Die!' (thanks again, Stormy!), a lighthearted and funny game, with plenty of weapons and traps. The sequel was more of the same with more of everything, including an option for having a second player, which the original did not have. This one was more of a ""trap-defense"" than tower defense though, since it had a predefined maze system.'Dungeon Defenders' is similar to OMD, consisting of a trivial story and being a trap-defense game with predefined mazes for enemies to travel. However, there isn't a real ""grid"", so things do not simply ""snap"" into place. The main aspect that sets this title ahead of the other two is that there's some ""investment"" into the character/characters (you can swap toons on the fly during the game between waves) you play. I really like the dash of action-RPG thrown into the mix, with leveling and picking the best gear. OMD also had some investment with the skulls/weapon upgrades, but anyone could get the maximum number of upgrades on weapons and traps if they put in enough time to earn the skulls. DD takes a step further to add uniqueness in customizing your character. Leveling your character takes care of the traps, but luck and personal comparing gear choices is what makes your character different from everyone else's. [note: lots of DLC for this one... maybe too much, but at least some of it's free]Now, I'm really looking forward to playing the upcoming sequels for Sanctum and Dungeon Defenders.			"

												Very great game.It's addictive, and really challenging (even if you're maximum level). It gives me a feeling as if I should play it to the very end, and even further. I personally love the art style and gameplay strategy, and how it gives you a choice on what you can do.Imagine it sort of like Castle Defense. Monsters come in, you need towers to take them out, but you are also able to attack the monsters yourself. However, monsters will attack your towers, and you if you get in their way. The best way to win is to work with others (agreeing with them on tower positions, repairing their defenses, etc), and to always think out your strategy before going in guns blazing (even at that, you'll still probably die if you think you can take them all on your own).However, one issue is that there is a lot of DLC. If you want some additional content, either have your wallet ready or buy the new Dungeon Defenders game (however, that game cannot be played without an internet connection).But if you only want four playable characters and around twenty levels and challenges (each), this should be for you.Another thing is that some online players (mostly newer ones) don't plan their strategy first and immediately want to get to killing. This can be a problem, since they steal the mana (what you use for abilities, towers, defenses, healing, etc) and start the wave before I can do anything.It's always good to talk to your team first before you do anything. Arguing over defense units (your limit of defenses) can be common, but usually it can be resolved.Overall: It's a great and fun game.			"

												This game can be addicting (at least for me it was).Although, it seems like no one really plays online anymore; however, at least there is local play. Issues I've had with this game, mostly because I am an achivement/trophy junky, the achievements recieved in game doesn't seem to log onto the steam account. Thus, the trophies I should have gotten from this game is not showcased on steam. This is very disappointing and distracting for me (ocd achievement junky and all). Other then that there are many maps, and lots of new creative challenges I've yet to buy or download. It was the first far more interactive defenders game I came across. Most are eagle view of the entire map and you plays towers or what not to defend, but this one you create a character and recieve armors, weapons, and pets. Maybe one day when I make enough money I'll invest in the purchasable maps and challenges. Until then, happy gaming.			"

												In Dungeon Defenders, the gameplay is good, as there is a fair bit of hack and slash but also tower defense. Not to mention that hacking this game isn't worth it. It has a good campaign that is not very deep, but the game also is a tower defense, not a blockbuster game like Call Of Duty Black Ops 2. The coop experience allows a whole new experience each time.One time,you may just breeze by it like nothing happened. Amp up the difficulty and you may just escape the hands of death. The difficulty is a good challenge for all players.  Luckily, the DLC is fairly priced.  About 3 dollars for a character with there own skills and fleshes. (i.e. the Summoner) This game suits alot of players. Like, I play summoner because i like the RTS feel of the game. The summoner feels way different than, say, the Knight. different towers,  Skills, and voices.  I would say that the game's cheap little price is well spent. Those who hack the game and say it sucks just haven't played co-op.  So pick up the game and I'll see you there!			"

												In Dungeon Defenders, the gameplay is good, as there is a fair bit of hack and slash but also tower defense. Not to mention that hacking this game isn't worth it. It has a good campaign that is not very deep, but the game also is a tower defense, not a blockbuster game like Call Of Duty Black Ops 2. The coop experience allows a whole new experience each time.One time,you may just breeze by it like nothing happened. Amp up the difficulty and you may just escape the hands of death. The difficulty is a good challenge for all players.  Luckily, the DLC is fairly priced.  About 3 dollars for a character with there own skills and fleshes. (i.e. the Summoner) This game suits alot of players. Like, I play summoner because i like the RTS feel of the game. The summoner feels way different than, say, the Knight. different towers,  Skills, and voices.  I would say that the game's cheap little price is well spent. Those who hack the game and say it sucks just haven't played co-op.  So pick up the game and I'll see you there!			"

												I have had this game for years and played it off and on. I love this game. You have many options in how you can build a map and the character you choose to play with. Whether you want to go full DPS or full Build Stat, you make the decision. The story is  good as well for what the game is based on. Some people WAY over think it and become bent out of shape with the story and how HORRIBLE it is. The higher levels you have to work for later in game. And the DLC I think is a plus because it adds variety to hero selection and map chocie. The game has been out for a whiile so Update are very few now. Modded weapons and hackers are a problem but what games dont have them. Just Screenshot, ,Kick, Report, and Move On.  Though I dont like how the Head developer treats his staff in a recent forum I found, I Love the game. I give it a 8.5-10 As of now due to the lack of updates and Lack Violation Penalty.			"

												Go in to Dungeon Defenders expecting a few dozen hours of good co-op and you will get your money's worth. There's a lot going on with characters, towers and loot drops galore and a few runs through the campaign will provide good entertainment. It does get fatiguing after a point though, and while it presents a huge amount of replayability, after a point difficulty ramps up excessively, the equipment grind sets in and the sparkle fades. Well worth it while the lustre remains, but rest assured you will eventually find yourself tiring of it and looking elsewhere to avoid frustration and boredom setting in.			"

												This game can be addicting (at least for me it was).Although, it seems like no one really plays online anymore; however, at least there is local play. Issues I've had with this game, mostly because I am an achivement/trophy junky, the achievements recieved in game doesn't seem to log onto the steam account. Thus, the trophies I should have gotten from this game is not showcased on steam. This is very disappointing and distracting for me (ocd achievement junky and all). Other then that there are many maps, and lots of new creative challenges I've yet to buy or download. It was the first far more interactive defenders game I came across. Most are eagle view of the entire map and you plays towers or what not to defend, but this one you create a character and recieve armors, weapons, and pets. Maybe one day when I make enough money I'll invest in the purchasable maps and challenges. Until then, happy gaming.			"

												This is my favorite game of all time. Dungeon Defenders is a tower defense-ish game. I hate tower defense games because they are rigid in where you can place what towers. Everything is in a grid & only certain types of towers are allowed in certain slots. DD is not at all like that. You are trying to prevent the mobs from destroying your crystal & you use towers and your hero to stop them. That's about where the similarities end. You can place your towers anywhere on the map, facing any direction, in any combinations. You can switch between characters to use towers from the Apprentice & the Squire, for example, but then play on your Monk. You cannot stack towers, but other than that you have nearly complete freedom in how you place towers. You have a maximum number of ""defense units"" with each tower using a particular number of DU to build so you need to be strategic with what towers you'll use where.Unfortunately the later levels are unplayably laggy. The other drawback is that the terrain appears to disappear on the latest waves in the large maps if you have a large group & the host's upload speeds aren't obscenely fast. For my purposes there was still plenty to do in the game other without hitting these bugs.Still, there is a ton of replayability and many, many different goals to work towards depending on your preferences. Increasing the difficulty doesn't feel like you're just doing the same map over & over as the mobs change as you increase difficulty which makes you change your build to handle the new mobs. The story is brief, but fun. The combat is intuitive. The menus are not at all intuitive, until you get used to them. I have never enjoyed a game even half as much as this one.			"

												I don't know what the devs have been up to as far as their morals, but the game they made is really solid. You need to think about the towers you place to clear a level. The classes are varied and powerful in different ways (though some are a little better than others, you can get far with any of them). Bigger and more challenging foes are always on the horizon, the RPG mechanics are cool, it's appropriately challenging, and it's even better with friends. I fully intend to get all the DLC and get a level 100 of every class, because I like this game that much. Also there's a gun that shoots chickens.			"

												This is my personal review on Dungeon Defenders The reason why this is negative:OK don't get me wrong I love this game I played it on the PS3 with my brothers and had an amazing time getting new gear and fighting wave after wave of enemies, but I decided to buy it on PC I bought it with all the DLC's and game half off (The DLC's are really good) The game ran perfectly fine on my mom's old sh**ty  laptop and didn't really have any texture Poppins or any visual problems on windows 8! But I got  a new PC and well I upgraded to windows 10. I recently tried to play multiplayer(split screen) with my friend, it did not work basically what happened is the hub did not pop up for either of our characters nor did the menus. There was also some texture Poppin and certain objects in the game would flicker (Single player and multiplayer this happened)Positive part:I can still play the game solo on my main rig and I will only have to deal with the annoying Texture airs. Btw I have a hub in single player and everything is playable. If I want to play multiplayer I can still hook up two controllers to my moms laptop and the experience is acceptable. Ps like I said this game is fantastic WHEN IT WORKS it is one of the best tower defence games I've played and probably is one of my favourites game ever!!!Conclusion: OK so if you have Windows 8 or you're just really lucky this game will probably work and if it does that's awesome because this game is awesome. If any of you out there know what problems I am talking about and could try to explain to me how to fix this problem that would be amazing.Main raid:GTX 107016 gigs of DDR4 RAMi5 6500 3.2 Windows 10			"

												I am late to the party with this game. I got it around the time Dungeon defenders 2 (Now dungeon defenders eternity) was anounced. Like most games i buy i saw it at a friends house while playing Xbox. I loved it. This is a good game. A great balance of tower defence,combat, and player interaction.  Now if you want to buy this game because you want to start with the first game for storyline reasons or something, then you have no real reason to buy this one. The storyline is simple, There are these magic Eternia crystals guarded by these great heros. The great heros go on crusade (appaerently along with every single person in the castle becasue there is absolutally NO ONE there) leaving there young apprentices in charge of doing chores and general up keep. While playing the suck it up entirely and unleash the ANCIENT EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVVVVVVVVIILLLLLLLLLL stored in the crystals. So its up to them to stop the EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEVVVVVVVVVVVVVVIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLLLLLL from destroying the rest of the eternia crsytals and save the land. The story does not advance past that point. So no reason to play it for storyline. You should play it however because it will give you a better expirence with the sequal as you will already know how to play the game. the ewnd			"

												On sale for about three or four dollars this is a great game no matter what.However that being said the game is mainly meant for playing with friends I feel, and while that would be all good and fine the problem I find with the game is that is it VERY short.  I've bought this game on both the PC and PS3 now and while I didn't get far in the PS3 here I found that the game is more for those that don't mind replaying the same stage over and over with little change up if any, and under whelming maps.  Another problem I have is they don't offer much for late game players, as in if you buy it now there is a butt ton of DLC that you'll have to pay for, though for those of you that already bought it before then, lucky you.  With all this said and done that's all of the flaws, it's still fun for about ten hours before you find out that they expect you to just replay the same maps or pay up for more, and it is a very pleasing to the eye game, just don't play public matches, keep things private.

												its actually really bad and boring. power creep makes the first part of the game 100% pointless and seemingly knowing this the developers made it so you can go from level 1 to 74 in about 20 minutes. team play is pretty non existant since theres just going to be one person with every character all of whom are bettter than you, unless youre that person in which case you need to go through the tedium of changing between characters and setting up mondo towers. its really bad and oring. youll find your self logging into games with a purpose made weak character but not weak enough to get you kicked just so you dont have to be the one to build and instead can afk like the other people in your game. gear is totally irrelevant because unless you hate your self no sane person is going to run around scavenging through the billion pieces of worthless loot on the ground that you need to mouse over for 3+ seconds to see if its worth grabbing. instead youll just shop for the best gear and the end			"

												I remember when this game was first released and tower defense games were lazy time filling flash games. Dungeon defenders expanded exceptionally on the original concept of tower defense.Each level has a number of waves of monsters you must defeat while defending your crystal. Each character has a unique combination of combat stats and defensive units (such as barricades, turrents, auras, etc). Each level in dungeon defenders has a finite number of points you can spend. You must co-ordinate with your team members to decide which strategic points to hold and what combination of defensive units to place.Level design is excellent, and the characters are versatile and interesting.Offline splitscreen multiplayer works well, although I cannot comment on online multiplayer. This game would be very tedius one player, and very hard as the game works best when players compliment each others skill sets.Subscribe to my curator page for more local multiplayer recommendations: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7189360/Check out my Couch Gaming group for specials, bundles, etc: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/CGLM "
