												This isn't just a mod, son. This is war. Run fast, go prone,♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants. The gameplay is intense and you have to be careful. No gimmicks, minimal HUD, pure FPS tactical action. Maps are asymetrical, not always fair. But this isn't about fair game. It's about survival. Position. Endurance. Hasn't been updated for quite awhile but there isn't any bad bugs. Still has a couple of populated servers at any given time.			"

												2300 Hours.Only a few of us left now.I'm surrounded by Terrorists.My comrade is nearby, shaking. He's been through the ringer, and he just gives me the Thousand Yard Stare.We can't move, the enemy set up a sniper position, moving now would just be committing suicide.Someone just got back from being AFK.He runs out into the open and yells ""LEEEROOOY JEEENKIIINS!"".He dies on the spot.Damn sniper.My ammo is almost depleted, it's nearing the end of the round.I hear gunshots being exchanged, the guy in the corner is no longer there, and blood is the only trace of him.A few moments later and it's quiet, too much for my own good. I feel myself tense.A terrorist rounds the corner and spots me, in the end, I'm down to no ammo and I'm near death.I hear an enemy nearby.'♥♥♥♥ it,' I thought.I pull out a grenade and hold the pin, I run out into the fray.I scream into my mic, ""ALLAHU ACKBAR!""Me and the enemy both die in the ensuing explosion.But what's this?We win?The guy that was in the corner from earlier was the last one remaining, he somehow took out the sniper.We indeed win, victory.But at what cost?I am forever tramautized.9/11-IGN, Would PTSD again.

												Insurgency is what other big budget shooters should try to be like. It's based more around strategy and good decision making than killstreaks or explosions (as it should be). This makes IMIC feel more like a classic military simulator among the likes of the original Rainbow Six or early Ghost Recon games, than Call of Duty or Battlefield. Even though death comes quickly and respawns are slow, I never felt frusturated because when I died I usually felt it was my own fault rather than cheap game design. I don't think I will be playing it for years on end like Counter Strike or TF2, mainly because there isn't a whole lot of content or support for it, but it certainly is worth playing at least a few times. While it is relatively simple (compared to most modern shooters) , it's alot of fun, especially since it's free.			"

												For all of those people who think this game is anything like any sort of spitting direction toward the Call of Duty Franchise, then you are sadly mistaken. This mod is based on Realism! Shots are shots, and kills are kills. Camping is non existent in this game. Tactical placement for the better advantage and movement of your team, or stopping of the opposing team is CRUCIAL. Sorry if you don't like getting shot from behind. Check your corners, stay low, and don't always look for someone to shoot, and you might be on your way to a successful match. That is all. Now stop reading and go and enjoy the damn game!			"

												Insurgency is arguably the best Total-conversion mod for any Source game. Teamwork is key, and without it, you and your team are destined for failure. If played correctly, Insurgency is one of the most satisfying FPS shooters you can play. I'd highly reccomend this mod. Although Insurgency is now an actual game in early development, you should get this and wait to get the stand alone game until it is further down the road in development.			"

Combat is fine and manageable.CONS: One, single achievement is unobtainable (IDK how, BTW). Few servers for other places. Since it's a mod, it requires HL2.

												Hello Fellow Soldiers,I strongly recommend INSURGENCY: Modern Infantry Combat! Although it is an older engine, it's still a great game! The game has different classes and different weapons to choose from for each class. The fact that there is so much option in such an old game is actually astonishing and the movement is extremely good for the time that the game came out! I recommend that you try this game before purchasing the new Insurgency as the new one has a similar function although a lot more content. If you enjoy this, you will most definitely enjoy the new version even more! It's definitely worth a shot, especially because it's free!-Kyle James			"

												10/10 game. I haven't played this in a while since my♥♥♥♥♥♥PC can't run it, but I don't think there's any players left, maybe there is though. There used to be this one server that had at least 10 players on it, most of the time it was 20. I don't know if that server still exists though. You have to see for yourself.			"

												If out of this New World Interactive made out Insurgency, then they f*cking made it good in all the right places.... Its like making a tasty cake out of sh*t (I'm not saying that Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat is bad, but it's far from perfect...)			"

												This was a mod when it was played. This picked up and pushed forward were CS source failed. The ejection port was on the correct side and the dust cover was down and the charging handle was used not the forward assist. Great game as far as team death match goes and enjoyable with good sound effects that made firefights tense at moments with headphones. A solid team was backing this when it was played.			"

												When Is game was active, I played It, although It was hard, the game was awesome, there was chat, voice chat, It was amazing, Its more of a strategy based shooter, like world war 2 and world war 1, Its amazing, Its hard to explain It words.Shoot-Run-Kill-Or Be Killed by your enemies.The lag on this game was rated by me-no lag, I had no problem playing It, or Installing. I had source games before, I still do, I never did do It with source, I only played the maps that was supported, anyways, It was a great game when the servers were active, It hardly lagged. 10/10 IGN			"

												Good game shows realistc problem in real combat, Nomarly cant always see where the enemey is coming or shooting. Then what it comes down to a gamble of chance where his firing postion is but i never treated this game this way because its so fun to just go guns blazing and shoot and throw grenades even though you die very quickly due to very good shoots in this game many good veteran players. Good community, 9/ 10 The big thing it needs fixed is just really more options for combat like IED it is of course a INSURGENCY and all you get is the simple bombs and not the hard to tell weather its a bomb or not IED's Need way more feel in this game if it ever wants to be even more realistc. That and more guns please :D!!			"

												Not perfect, of course. But actually pretty fun. Nobody is playing it however, but it's not like Counterstrike or HL, or Hidden, there are no empty servers. The servers you do join are full of hacking and sooo many middle eastern people. Now i'm not racist but oh my god.... They like vlog into the mic.

												Many years have past since I last left the basement. Hours upon hours have been spent perfecting my military skils in INSURGENCY: Modern Infantry Combat. I recommend this game after, and only after you purchase at least fifty pounds of Pepperoni Hotpockets. You will not be able to leave your seat, for the Taliban are everywhere... I think there's a terrorist hiding under my discared Hotpocket wrappers... Probably a wired explodsive device strapped to my chair. As one might be concerned, how does one take care of personal matters? I do not. That's why bottles were invented my dear Watson. I even perfected mastubation by climaxing on the trigger of three left eye winks over a fifteen second period. I am a true soldier.			"

												A nice Game i can say...It's like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.You can take it,it's free,that is the best part.A Counter-Strike Free!Ok,now let's talk about the Game.INSURGENCY: Modern Infantry Combat is primarily a team-based, multiplayer online shooter focused on tactical, objective-based gameplay. The player can join one of two teams, the US Marines, or their adversaries, the Insurgents. Teams are structured around two squads, for a total of 16 maximum players per team. Within this team structure are limited player classes, such as the Rifleman, Support Gunner, Engineer, or Marksman.The game has a pseudo-realistic portrayal of the weaponry used. There is no on-screen crosshair and the players must use the iron sights of the game's weapon model to accurately aim the weapon. Shooting ""from the hip"" is still possible; however, the free-aim system makes this difficult. Weapons are also deadly, with most rifles capable of taking out players with one or two shots to the torso. According to their class, players can also use fragmentation grenades, smoke grenades, and RPGs.Maps are generally focused on urban warfare, even though there are suburban and outdoor settings.			"

												This game (mod) is very well made. It can be hard to get kills but I have about 24 and that was in a day and by the time you read this (by 2 or more days later) i might have 30, 35, etc (kills). This game reminds me of Counter Strike,which I LOVE Counter Strike, especialy Global Offensive. The only difference is that you can actualy choose your weapon without using points or in-game money, you can use the comands !guns or !guns2 to choose from a variety of guns in the game.I gave it an 8.5/10 froutloops for good gameplay, its pretty(correct me in pretty) realistic, and the weapons. Only downside is that the realistic death is a bit too realistic, and by that I mean that you die like in real life, you get shot 2, 3 times and your dead,other games you take like 6 shots to die.

The gunplay is nice, the weapons have a nice feel to them, and all in all I really would have to say I recommend this game if you're looking for a nice team based source shooter.Yes you can quickscope.No it doesn't do much damage.

												INSURGENCY: MIC is a decent HL2 mod that has recently been rebuilt as it's own standalone game.  Back around 2010 was arguably the glory days of MIC.  Back then, there were always servers up and running, and active clans, and a great community.  However, as time went on, more people seemed to stop playing, and client-side modding became more prevalent.  This game became ruined as a material hack became popular and more servers failed to enforce sv_pure 1.I'd say that less than 100 people are ever on at once.  Very few servers are ever populated, and even then they're eastern European servers with bad latency and a lacking community.  This mod is dying but hopefully it will live on in the standalone.The game itself isn't too shabby.  There's Marines and Iraqi insurgents.  Each team has two squads, and each team has a few specialty weapons such as the RPG-7 or M16 with grenade launcher.  The game comes with maps that are all well made and provide a good atmosphere.  A fairly popular map was a rehash of de_dust2 from CS:S.  Weapons damage is more realistic, and there's no crosshairs.  The game is more immersive than Counter-Strike: Source and typical last-gen FPS games.  7/10 for nostalgia, but I'm not going to sink any more time into this one.			"

												Brilliant game! Recommended.As i'm only 14, most kids on FPS shooters arent really welcome as we get a ton of hate and are told to ""go play xbox or cod"" Now let me clarify this.. I F***ING hate Call Of Duty with a passion. I appeal to games like Zombie survival.. Apocolyptic enviroments and open world RPG titles. Not fast paced, close quarter combat.. despite this game being that, the warfare seems very slow-paced. People play it smart. Help eachother out. Instead of someone telling me to ""kill myself"".. I was told to instead go right towards flag A and cover my leader. Teamwork goes a long way.If you like games like Arma 1/2/3 and Insurgency. This game IS a must!Thumbs up! Recommended 10/10.			"

												Not played it much but here is my review on the game.I have been looking for a low spec military simulation game and this is exactly what i wanted, the audio of the gunfire is great and sounds real. The recoil is very difficult to control which adds to the reality. The game as a large learning curve. It isnt a complicated as ArMa but is still a amazing military simulator			"

												Insurgency is a multiplayer, tactical first person shooter. It implements elements of realism, in an attempt to increase player immersion and promote teamwork. The game is primarily set in Iraq, however some maps are set in Afghanistan.There are two teams available, the US Marines and the Insurgents. Teams are structured around two squads, for a total of 16 maximum players per team. Within this team structure are limited player classes, such as the Rifleman, Support Gunner, Engineer or Marksman.There is no on-screen crosshair and the players must use the iron sights of the game's weapon model to accurately aim the weapon. The maps are small but this does not mean that there is no tactics involved. Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat is one of the most realistic source mods out there. At the beginning it is hard but once you play for a few hours, you start to get the hang of it. If you want a more modern graphic you can look for the remake ""Insurgency"".Sounds 7/10Graphics 7/10Gameplay 8/10Atmosphere 8/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

Most of the time you will be stuck in a small confined area, house or complex with some other allies, or by yourself, taking sniper-fire and being suppressed.

												The underlying mechanics of this game are solid and the more ""realistic"" approach is certainly appreciated as it actually does require you to make some tactical considerations, however the game undermines itself in a pretty severe way. And that is the maps themselves. They are still designed around more arcade style shooters, and so what you often find happening is that there is never a defensible point, and no choke points to have any sort of firefight. Inevitably every public match will end up becoming a sort of free for all death match where players sprint around the levels hoping to get the drop on an unsuspecting opponent. The most fun I have had with this mod was when it was more popular and people where running counterstrike source maps in it. Those maps actually had good design philosphy and worked especially well with the shooting mechanics in this game. As insurgency stands now though, I cannot recommend it. It is an oddity, the parts that work, work really well, but it is unfortunate that the developers never bothered to create functional maps. If they had I suspect the community would have stuck around.			"

												I downloaded this thinking it was the same raw game play as ""Insurgency"" I was sadly mistaken it is a clunky half life2 mod.Don't be fooled this doesn't have near the same game play as ""Insurgency"" does.  Saying that I'm sure it was a huge undertaking to the, the obviously beginner Devs that designed this game and I am thankful that the community is trying to give us games that are fun. In closing this game is as stated b4 is a clunky HL2 mod that plays like the original  day of defeat. Movement is clunky weapons are inaccurate and combat along with sounds just don't even come close to the original insurgency. Sorry but as a combat Vet this game gets only 1.5 stars out of 5 from me. Keep in mind Insurgency gets 3.5 stars from me			"

												I've only played maybe half an hour of this game, but I can already see plenty of problems. The main menu is incredibly bland. Don't hope to sit in the menu and hope to do anything other than mess with your options, because so far no character loadouts or anything of the like has been added. Or any sense of accomplishment greeting you when you start up the game. The short time I've played, there was only one server up. And apparently no-one spoke english. Combat looks decent, but the looking down your iron sights really feels rusty, like it's not a natural or smoothe motion. And the fog of war doesn't help you see enemies that keep picking you off from 30 yards away. This game does have some redeeming features, like playing as the sergeant you can issue commands. And there are smoke grenades. But they have a rather small effect. All of the movement controls are definitely a plus. Lean, crouch, prone, sprint... All in all, this is a decent game and with a bit more of a following or a few more servers up, who knows... the devs might make a few tweaks and this game will become a success. But as is, it's very rough around the edges.			"

												I can recommend this game to those who likes realism. It's like a real combat simulator. If you want to feel yourself in real combat try this game. In most cases I was killed I didn't see who killed me and from where. In most cases I killed everyone is when they didn't see me. Call of Duty like game which is less responsive and more hardcore(you often kill with a single hit). I didn't see any teamwork or tactics in game. Doesn't require high aiming skills, just find a good place to camp and kill everyone. I don't like effects when you get killed, the sounds are too loud. Also when bullets hit walls near you, you don't see anything because of blured screen. Although, maps look great, weapons also look great. Maps are also realistic with lots of camping spots and encourage camping, thus you get killed from the back most of the time. And one more thing I noticed, you can be killed by a player which you don't even see because of latency(ping). E.g. you sit into a room, looking at the entrance door. You get killed first and then the player that killed you shows in the door.			"

												Insurgency is probably the most realistic game I've ever played. You play as either a U.S. Marine or a Terrorist. The only objective I've so far though is to capture all the points. And the aiming can take some getting used to, because it aims like a N64 shooter, i.e. Perfect Dark without the crosshair. And yes, it is a tactical shooter. You can't just run in the field of battle alone or without a plan. There is also a weapons menu, incase you don't like your weapon, you can just type !guns or !guns2. That's all I've got to say for now.			"

												An amazing game, but defanatly not for everyone.This is one of the scarriest and most intence shooter I've ever played with my peers (although I don't know how much that remark counts). Hitting the dirt as an Iraqi Insurgant opens fire on you from a rooftop, bullets flying everywhere, you chracter losing their wits, and not knowing where you're being shot at from is the very reason why so many people are turned off by this game, but for me it is what sells it. Not only is seeing someone else on the other team before they see you and taking them out extremely satisfying, but its also free! If you're new, just grab some friends and play it together!			"

												Very realistic game, especially for a game taking place in modern day. It's way better than ARMA, and people who are online actually work together!! You die in quick matters if not careful, You have to take cover a lot... People actually can't see you in smoke grenades... It's probably one of my favorite realism-based games. I can't wait to try the new Insurgency			"

												As a fan of tactics and awesome firefights with brain i can recommend this title to the people that are not likely to play say... Battlefield or Call of duty.. cause this is a whole other story.. its slower paced its tactical as hell and its about sounds and stealthy forwarding... one shot one kill and you have no idea if you hit because there is no indiciation saying so. So your behind your barrel wondering if you killed him... but you dont know.. so you check...and BAM! your dead.. and the round starts over when everyone except one team died. Good game but def. not for everyone as i have experienced there is a learning curve to be followed before enjoying this title. For the price it's a nobrainer...			"

												NOTICE: THIS IS A REALLY HARDCORE GAME WITH A VERY HIGH LEARNING CURVE.Welcome to Insurgency, with the realism of Red Orchestra or Arma 2, but with a little bit faster pace to it. You're thrown directly into the battlefields of Afghanistan or Iraq, including real-life locations like Fallujah. The gameplay at first glance can really overwhelm a new player. Although the level of combat is actually on a small scale, it really can show what real combat is like. The pop and whizz of bullets passing around you and the blur as dust is kicked in your face.Now, I'll admit it, this game is NOT for people that don't like working as a team. If your a COD kiddie, or something along those lines where you don't care about your team and just want some cheap kills, this game won't work for you. If you're interested in teamwork, realism, and some legit skills and kills. This game is the right thing. Get some friends and work as a team, the players that do this always fare better than the ones that go lone wolf. Camping is an actual part of the game. Your machinegunners and/or snipers are best used when left back, allowing them to properly use their long range and supportive roles. Your grenadiers, rifleman and other assaultive forces are what moves up and takes the OBJ.I'll admit, it has it's flaws. Teamkilling can be a real issue as very few servers have proper admins to ban people. ANd finding a good community may be really tough at first. But once you find the right group, you should be fine.			"

Large maps, all the normal gamemodes and being able to choose a class make this MOD (yeah, a MOD) worth your time.But wouldn't recommend to someone that just likes to ""run n' gun"", you might find this game a little slow if you're one of those people.[Also, be sure to check the newer Insurgency video game.]			"

												If you're like me and wanted to see that game that has fast action but are sick of the instant regeneration of health plus how you could fill them with bullets and only chip their health this is the game for you.  Shot them in the torso with a sniper?  Dead.  Assault rifle? Dead.  Pistol might take two or three but the results are the same.  It adds quite a bit of tension when you hope going around that corner won't give the enemy that one shot they need on you.			"

												I remember when I first got this game - way back in 2008, I was looking for something realistic and unforgiving yet fast paced and intense and stumbled upon this... I put countless hours in and I can still say that it's one of my favourite games to date, sadly when ever I feel like bringing back the old times of .aBW* or -||ScK||- I'm reminded that the game has practically died out, only one server with players on the server browser and it's usually filled with people who don't know much about teamwork.But hey - if you're trying to decide if you want to buy the standalone version then the damage models are similar in here, even though it's lacking a lot of the features they added in Insurgency 2 so that can help you decide if you can find people playing.Sadly Ins2 lacks a lot of the great maps from here, I really miss them. Haditha, Samawah, Hillah, Baghdad, Karam, Karkar  and Almaden - may you rest in peace. Even Sinjar is too easy there.			"

												Modern Infantry Combat is a nice, solid Scource mod set in the Gulf War. The game has alot of good machanics like being able to lean around corners , a small but active community and alot of cool maps. My favorite so far is the old mineshaft one, thats proably one of the coolest maps ive seen in a FFPs game. Its free, its well put together and its a small file, so why not give it a try. If your considering getting the new insurgency you could get a feel for it here for free.10/10 A good free mod, exactly as advertised.			"

												There isn't too much to say about INS, even with my 200hrs of gameplay.Mod is well crafted. It's just like casual version of ArmA. It requires from You to work together with your fellow team members. Team must as soon as possible split up into ""groups"", some people must recive ""special tasks"", for example: guarding alternative routes to prevent ememies for attacking from behind or flanking your position. Lone wolves gonna be quickly killed, very often with only two or sometimes even one bullet by someone from opposite team.But It still delivers this casual dynamic for gameplay. Example: With ""proper"" poeple on both sides, Marine's attack on Bravo objective on ins_sinjar map will always end up with quite spectacular battle, marines struggle to reach B, insurgents figthing them off. Those moments when many players died and immediately trie to go back to make things better this time. Brilliant.There is only one ""negative"" side You need to take under consideration before downloanding INS. If there are too many dumb people in your team, who are not willing to cooperate with rest of the team, You'll be quickly crushed by enemies. This can easily become ""spawn-killing party"" and You'll end up being angry, while enemies are taking one objcetive after another without any resistance. This can be very frustrating on maps like previously mentioned ins_sinjar where Insurgents cannot retake objective from marines hands after loosing it and must focus on defending next one. But hey. War. War never changes.PS. Sorry for my english. I'm from Poland.			"

												The real military action deal. This game nails urban combat perfectly. You don't need a high-end PC to run this and all you need to buy is a Source game. This game gives you the sense that someone will flank you from every corner. Extreme paranoia can lead to your team's victory or a bloody medevac. Insurgency is a perfect piece of art just for a mod that seems like it could be an independant title. This game reaches the gameplay style that so many well-funded developer studios fail to achieve. This is a can't-miss offer.			"

												There isn't too much to say about INS, even with my 200hrs of gameplay.Mod is well crafted. It's just like casual version of ArmA. It requires from You to work together with your fellow team members. Team must as soon as possible split up into ""groups"", some people must recive ""special tasks"", for example: guarding alternative routes to prevent ememies for attacking from behind or flanking your position. Lone wolves gonna be quickly killed, very often with only two or sometimes even one bullet by someone from opposite team.But It still delivers this casual dynamic for gameplay. Example: With ""proper"" poeple on both sides, Marine's attack on Bravo objective on ins_sinjar map will always end up with quite spectacular battle, marines struggle to reach B, insurgents figthing them off. Those moments when many players died and immediately trie to go back to make things better this time. Brilliant.There is only one ""negative"" side You need to take under consideration before downloanding INS. If there are too many dumb people in your team, who are not willing to cooperate with rest of the team, You'll be quickly crushed by enemies. This can easily become ""spawn-killing party"" and You'll end up being angry, while enemies are taking one objcetive after another without any resistance. This can be very frustrating on maps like previously mentioned ins_sinjar where Insurgents cannot retake objective from marines hands after loosing it and must focus on defending next one. But hey. War. War never changes.PS. Sorry for my english. I'm from Poland.			"

												This is what the predecessor of the reworked Insurgency and in some ways, I still prefered this to the newer and slightly more faster paced gameplay of Insurgency. Maps felt larger and weapons were in some ways, better, than in the current iteration of Insurgency. For example, you could actually aim down sights with the M203 grenade launcher which could be used out to distant ranges as a short of infantry mortar. I would say that Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat, has aged extremely well!			"

												Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat is a very good and unique mod, that pits you in a semi realistic simulation in iraq as either a U.S. Marine or a Iraqi Insurgent. The mod is about capturing all the Objectives, but it also got some custom map servers running Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and i once even saw Last Man Standing!The mod is probably the most realistic HL2 mod available, unless you count Garrys Mod with millions of  addons on it.Pros:Semi Realistic combat experienceUnique Mod; Theres no real mod that is like thisAuthentic mapsTeamwork - Most people you'll meet will be following your orders, or giving you these, and you will be pretty good with this one.Advanced Shooter: Realistic Gun Simulation, Authentic Mapping, Great experienceCons:Honestly, i dont have any cons for right now, with exception of No advanced wounding - I keep finding my self shooting one pointblank with a shotgun in the legs or arms, and they just kill me and run.Overall Rating: 9.8/10.0			"

												This is my favorite third party mod for the source engine.  I perfer it to COD for both its realism and price lol.  It is class based like DODS.  KDR isn't important in this game and it really doesn't show up on your score other than a small point bonus.  What matters is teamwork and players who haven't shot a single guy can still be the mvp of the team.The RPGs are unrealistic in this game but that is no big deal unless your up against an RPG sniper.  The sound effects and visuals are great and the game generally runs well.It is free so don't be a ♥♥♥♥♥ and GET IT!			"

												Insurgency is probably the most realistic game I've ever played. You play as either a U.S. Marine or a Terrorist. The only objective I've so far though is to capture all the points. And the aiming can take some getting used to, because it aims like a N64 shooter, i.e. Perfect Dark without the crosshair. And yes, it is a tactical shooter. You can't just run in the field of battle alone or without a plan. There is also a weapons menu, incase you don't like your weapon, you can just type !guns or !guns2. That's all I've got to say for now.			"

												No doubt the most realistic war game I've ever played. You're not a super soldier with regenerating health who runs into the middle of the battlefield pumping round after round into your enemy until they die like in 99% of war games or knifing them for an instant kill; it takes only a few shots to kill (like in real life) and a ton of strategy to win, you have to play it slow or else you get killed instantly (again, like in real life). It even has character customization which is quite limited but still enough to be satisfying. Even if you prefer the CoD or Battlefield way, I say give this game a shot; after all it is free. What I like most though is that you can actually play as the insurgents and fight off the foreign invaders, something most games today which are all about how great and heroic America is don't have. This game has no equal. Play it.			"

												Though you may be thinking that INSURGENCY is a FPS like any other, it is not. This is, without exaggeration, the most realistic FPS I have ever played and possibly the most realistic FPS ever made. It is very easy to get killed in this, you MUST use teamwork to function, and use cover while moving. If you are a Call of Duty or Battlefield fan, you will be tremendously disappointed, if you are not, and you have been looking for a realistic FPS since you played your first FPS, get INSURGENCY!

I spent a few hours daily for several weeks playing this, and had plenty fun moments that i still remember today.This is a old game, with not that great mechanics and graphics. But for people who can appreciate the good old looks and feels and like FPS's id higly suggest giving this game a try. The maps are decently sized, with not a whole lot to be confused over and doesnt take too long to get used too.

												Well I can't write a good review, so I just wanna say it's a GREAT GAME.It's actually the same game as Insurgency, but with lower graphics and system of the gameplay like the guns acc and players costume, but for F2P it's already ****ing AWESOME!Well, for me, the only bad things is that it only has about 3 or 2 server remaining with only about 20+ people playing.Oh and I think there are several people who are cheating using hacks, I don't know are they using hack or not, but they are really easy to kill me and my teamates. But that doesn't made the game really hard.10/10 for me :D			"

												The game itself is very good, it´s the mod that gave origin to the standalone Insurgency game, just with lower graphics altough expected from a source engine game. The biggest downside and one that pratically destroys the game is that it´s basically dead, so it doesn´t matter how good the game is if you have trouble finding a single server to join. Overall I give it a 8/10 for gameplay but it´s not worth it installing it right now and I very much doubt it will make a comeback in the near or long future. My best advice is to buy the standalone version if you enjoy realistic military shooters and are tired of the Battlefield´s and COD´s.			"

												I really enjoy this game, although there are still bugs. Highly reccomend, although the community is quite small.			"

												Very well made game. The second i join a game, some guy kept screaming ""allahu akbar"" in his mic while some other guy glitched into the ground and was able to shoot at us while he was in the ground. Lots of grenade spam. 10/10, would play again.			"
