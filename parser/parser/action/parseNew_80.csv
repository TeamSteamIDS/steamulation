												To start out, I've really got more like five hundred hours in this game. I started playing it obsessively long before Valve thought to add playtime records.It's fun.The bots are fairly competent as long as you disallow them from buying grenades and the list of maps that come prepackaged far outstrips that of the original Counter-Strike. (They're also far prettier, at least as much as they can be on the GoldSrc engine). Hostages are, as always, somewhat brain-dead, but they're nowhere near as bad as the ones in Counter-Strike: Source--although the fact they all wear identical orange jumpsuits makes me wonder who really are the good and bad guys. Isn't variety the spice of life?Sound design and quality are improved slightly from the original game and many of the less generic maps lack that kitchen_rats look that's become so indicative of Half-Life's engine, so that's a plus. At the same time, a lot of maps have odd collision detection issues and I'm somewhat bothered by the fact that Counter-Terrorists are as chatty over the radio as their criminal counterparts.			"

												If you want to be destroyed by people who've been playing the game since CS 1.1 release and are tryhard mlg pros, you get 1.6.If you want to play dress up dolls with your guns and play with a bunch of people who complain about their ranks and blame you for losing, you get Global Offensive.If you want to play a ton of mini games and never find any servers with the actual core game, you get Source.If you want to actually have fun, have better balanced weapons, play with a decent community, have a game that can run on nearly any computer, and actually play the core Counter-Strike game, you get Condition Zero.

												Back when Counter-Strike tried a campaign mode. The game is a series of mini-objectives against bots on various maps, while the Deleted Scenes extra is a full blown CS campaign with many elements of the online game being brought in with solo FPS gameplay mechanics (such as equipment) to make a fun and hilarious game (the stereotypical russian accents make me laugh every time). The multiplayer part is quite similar to the original CS but with slightly better textures.Overall, this isn't a game for people who like CS:GO, it's more for the fans of old school FPS games and OG Counter-Strikers. I do recommend it nonetheless, but keep in mind that the game is over 10 years old.			"

												Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a follow up to the original Counter-Strike game. This game was released in 2004, so almost eleven years ago. Condition Zero uses the Half-Life engine. What we have here is a CS game which includes a single player mission pack. When it comes to playing Counter-Strike, I am more or less a newb at it. This game gave me the perfect opportunity to learn the guns, maps and mission types without the pressure of feeling like you are letting your team down by sucking. The campaign took me about four hours to complete, but this was only on Normal mode, you can go back and replay the missions on a higher difficulty to eventually work your way up to playing online. I also found the squad management system to be a nice little feature which isn't seen in other CS games, at the start of each mission, you can choose which squad members to take with you on the mission, each of the team members have their positive and negative stats so you can really get stuck in with min-maxing them. You start out with three members and you work you way up to having a full blown squad of about eight men. On each of the missions you also have to complete specific challenges, these can be goals set around killing a certain amount of people, winning the match in less than ninety seconds, rescuing a specific amount of hostages etc etc. This added a little variety of play, especially the challenges where you have to use a certain weapon in order to complete them. This allowed you to learn how to use other guns effectively rather than sticking with your tried and tested Rifle and Deagle. While the graphics do not come close to looking like games we have in the current day, the game still does look nice. I wasn't put off by the dated graphics one bit; I guess that just shows how good the Half Life engine actually is!  The difficulty levels completely rely on how hard you want to make it. I started out on Normal mode just to get to grips with the game as I am newb like that; but you can work all the way up to playing as if you are in a match online and have the brutally hard experience if you want to. Easy mode is complete walk in the park though, enemies can be standing in front of you for about three seconds before they realize they should shoot you, and even then they spray bullets randomly all around you without actually hitting, so I wouldn't recommend you start out on Easy mode. Like I said, the campaign took me about four hours to complete, but there are two or three more difficulty levels to try out, and I can see this adding a lot of variety into the game play, so I can easily see the single player alone taking about twelve hours to complete it fully on all difficulties. I found no technical issues what so ever while playing, I would assume all the bugs and niggles would of been ironed out years ago.. In conclusion I can easily recommend Counter-Strike: Condition Zero for anyone looking to get into the FPS or CS scene, it will easily give you a worthwhile experience, giving you the opportunity to learn all of the CS maps, guns and game modes in a pressure free environment. If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up. You can also find more reviews over at http://www.completingthebackloggroup.com/ "

												Counter Strike: Condition Zero comes with two games:1. Condition Zero2. Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes1. Condition ZeroBasically Counter Strike 1.6 but with improved graphics and the addition of bots. The bots are amazing considering when this game was released (they're still inferior to human players). In addition, the bots are a great way for beginners to learn about the game in a more relaxed environment. There is also a singleplayer Tour of Duty, which is basically regular counter strike missions against bots, but with additional challenges (example: kill 3 enemies with a sniper rifle). Sadly, the Tour of Duty missions are Counter-Terrorist only. There are no Terrorist missions.2. Condition Zero: Deleted ScenesThis is a singleplayer game. It uses the same weapons and game mechanics as Condition Zero, but with some additions, including the awsome fiber optic camera. Level design is one of Deleted Scenes' greatest strengths. The AI is passable. The story is where it fails, in that each mission is its own self-contained story with practically no connecting elements. I suspect you don't even play as the same person in each mission. Immersion takes a serious hit because of this. It helps to pretend you are playing as the same person. I recommend Adrian Shephard before Black Mesa.I had a lot of fun playing Condition Zero and Deleted Scenes. I highly recommend these games as well as any other Counter Strike game (or any game by Valve for that matter). By the way, check out the first screenshot on the store page. Really take a close look at the plane...			"

												I bought this game on sale, because i wanted to have the full CS collection, but what a great surprise i got when i actually played it. Its CS with a campaign mode or Tour of Duty, whatever you wanna call it.If you want a challenging single-player mode with different difficulties and maps, then this game has what you want but expect some bugs and the AI isnt great but gets the job done and its challenging enough for a good time.The Deleted Scenes game only adds more content to CZ with new missions all over the world where you play as different units with a story behind each mission and a lot of objectives to follow. The game isnt recent but you can still have fun with it in 2014, at least, in my opinion.I totally recommend if you wanna have some single-player fun.7.5/10			"

												I've been playing Condition Zero for hours, playing online, singleplayer missions, etc. And my final Word for this Game is: It's (atleast in my opinion) the probably BEST Counter Strike game ever made. The Gameplay, the new Maps, and everything else made this game perfect. ""Deleted Scenes"" is also a nice idea that was added to the Game with the singleplayer campaign. (once again, my opinion). This game is truly worth all of your money, and i recommend it to anyone who's new to Counter Strike.I give this Game a 9.5/10, really good ""update"" of the original Counter Strike.			"

												A great ""tutorial"" for beginner CS players, the missions are just your usual bomb defusal scenarios with some bad AI, even though the AI is bad some of the time you still need to be tatical, the community is decently sized and the bots (that plague some servers) are just insanely good in some servers, the controls are smooth, gameplay is fluid, and there is wide variety of guns, it can run on a potato so you'll be able to play this on almost any potato you own, and the default maps that you play on during the missions are really well done, only complaints are that it can feel boring dying very early in a round and having to wait the entire round, and you still have to wait even in the missions with bots, overall I'd say buy the copy with this and the original Counter-Strike and try this one out first.And a side note; the deleted scenes in my opinion are MUCH better than the Condition Zero base game itself, it offers a good variety of maps and scenarios while giving the player more guns and action, if I were to give a score for that one it would be a 9/10.But for the regular Condtion Zero it would be around a 7.5/10			"

												Counter Strike Condition Zero is the sequel to the original Counter Strike and now it includes a Single Player Campaign, so let's take a look shall we ?When I mentioned that this game has a single player campaign, I didn't mean a story mode. The single player campaign is a very short bundle of missions where you have few objectives during each missions. Like rescue hostages, defuse bombs and take out terrorists with a specific weapon.The missions are incredibly short and you can finish all 12 within 2 hours. The AI will make the hostage missions a living hell. Once the round starts the AI are on the hunt to find any enemy player on the field and will not help you so don't expect any help from the AI. Getting a hostage to a drop off, before your team kills the entire enemy team.The gameplay is not much different from the original Counter Strike so don't expect a major change.Now for the feature everyone cares. THE MULTIPLAYER. It's almost completely dead. I had trouble finding a match and when I did get into a full lobby match, I felt bored and it's not as good as the original Counter Strike.This game is not good, but it's not horrible either. The campaign is short and not worth the money and the multiplayer is slowly dying out. In the end only get this if you're a hardcore fan, otherwise get any other game in the franchise.Final Rating:6/10 - Okay If you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you dislike post in the comments on what you dislike about the review.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												The classic counter strike with slightly improved graphics, new content new maps and improved bots. The single player 'campaign' in it is basically playing all the usual maps and get certain number of kills in certain weapons and rescue certain number of hostages nothing fancy but It's just a very good classic.I only recommend it if you're getting it through the valve bundle.UPDATE:The counter strike condition zero deleted scenes redirected me to the same store page as this so apparently it comes with it, the deleted scenes have a decent campaign consisting of different missions on the world map including all the counter strike characters, weapons and even new equipment and some stealthy action, it was a fun campaign, it is totally worth it.

												This game is more fun with the bots. Granted, the AI is sometimes terrible and glitchy for many maps (even cz ones), but the most fun is to edit the botprofile.db and make your own unique bots (it's very easy to do) and essentially form your own match league. I have created around 700 bots each with their own clan tag, track standings/stats etc. Granted, it's a lot of bot-simulated matches which would be boring to most people, but has kept me occupied as I am a stat junkie. Captures some level of competion for me, as I am way too old to participate in any ladders or really be any good anymore, whereas most people could dominate any of the bots very easily. But for me, a fun little throwback to my younger days. Now I'll go put my false teeth back in and take a lap around the retirement center on my motorized cart.			"

												I was originally just going to punch in 5 minutes so I could make this review just about the Deleted Scenes, but I decided to be fair and try out the base game too.Condition Zero's Tour of Duty mode is a series of levels that one could describe as a campaign without a plot. In each level, you have to complete a set of tasks, or ""challenges"", while stopping the terrorists from doing their thing enough times to satisfy the level's non-challenge requirements. You can create your own squad by buying teammates from a roster of 36 counter-terrorists, each with different levels of skill and weapon preferences, with points earned by completing levels.The Tour of Duty is very simplistic, but it managed to make me like it a bit and I normally hate playing multiplayer-oriented game matches with only bots, which it essentially is. And in my opinion, it on the Easy difficulty feels like a tutorial; One lacking explanations of the game's controls, but also one that trains the player by putting them up against targets that move and shoot back, which is not present in the tutorials featured in the Deleted Scenes and CS:GO. Update: Currently at frustrating point where the Terrorist AI is almost cheating and the Counter-Terrorist AI is braindead.Then I tried out the multiplayer for a bit. Not long enough for me to actually say anything about it, but from my limited experience it felt like CS:S but different. I hate CS:S for several reasons so I'm going to see later if it's different in a way that I'll enjoy it. It's basically CS:S but deader, has worse level design, and you have to remember to buy ammo. Not my thing.Finally, the ultimate purpose of this review: The Deleted Scenes. It's a set of 18 different missions, each having a different scenario (and are not connected in a grand scheme or anything like a campaign in say, Call of Duty). I don't have much more to say about it in terms of description, so here's where I begin the ""opinion"" part (I think there's a much better word for it but I'm tired): Holy f**k it's good. It of course suffers from dated graphics and some weaker level design here and there, but it is fun. I've done all of the missions 3 times over 25~ hours and dear god I think I might do it several more times even after finding all of the secrets within. It makes me furious that CS:GO's campaigns were limited time because I'd replay a Counter-Strike campaign with CS:GO's gameplay and graphics more times than I think I will replay Deleted Scenes. Update: Forgot to say this when I first published this review but the music's great too. Especially the music in Secret War, that level's awesome in almost every aspect.Overall: If for nothing else, buy this game just for the Deleted Scenes. Unless you like CS:S but want a more retro feel and can put up with poorly-balanced AI in the Tour of Duty, that's like the main selling point.			"

												      Counter Strike Condition Zero is an odd one. Caught in between CS 1.6 and Source, it came very close to CS: Source's release, and was brushed aside. At the time, it graphics were outdated, and its single player content was lacking. Today, the single player content is just as lackluster. The regular campaign is literally offline bots with some slight customization. It's bland, boring, and the AI is pretty terrible. There's also the ""Deleted Scenes"", which is actually an entirely other game. It's a single player CS Campaign that plays nothing like Counter Strike. It feels more like a fast-paced Arcade shooter. It's plagued with poor map design, cheesey plot that desperately wanted to blend with games like Halo at the time, and gimmicky spy gadgets that while intriguing at first, are poorly executed.     Where Condition Zero does shine is its multiplayer. It's graphics are dated but timeless. It feels like an updated CS 1.6 in visuals, and plays in a way thats really unique to Condition Zero. Ammunition is expensive and money is tight, so you really have to watch your shots in this game. It still has a very large playerbase, and holds up much better than the classic 1.6    While Condition Zero failed to capture a single player Counter Strike expirience, it did create a pretty fun Multiplayer that's still fun to hop on today. It's by no means a masterpiece, but it isn't a bad game. If the CS Anthology pack ever goes on sale, I'd say pick it up and try it out. But on its own, I'd say it's a pass.			"

												Counter-Strike:Condition Zero is the best game online because it is easy to use for all the computers since it don't need so many requirements as other games, this way many mas users are going to have an easy access to play this fabulous game in line. It is also one a revolution in this of the games online since the change of graph is very well-known between(among) the Condition Zero and the first Counter-Strike and its alone realism overcome by the Counter-Strike: Source. This game also can be played of a player by if you want to play the way history.			"

												The reason I bought this was for Deleted Scenes. CZ Deleted Scenes are in deep need of polishing for todays standards, but give it a break it was probably made before you were born. Deleted Scenes has very good cutscenes that catch you up and are a great part of the game. Once again, the AI needs polishing for todays standards, but the enviroment still does its job even to today by giving you a slight unsettling feeling as you battle enemies. Deleted Scenes campaign is SINGLEPLAYER so you can play Counter-Strike offline, which is cool as hell in my opinion. Counter-Strike campaign offline. However, just like every other CS game you probably need experience with the FPS genre. Don't let easy mode fool you because it is really tough. Any CS fan will love CZ.			"

												Condition Zero is basically Counter-Strike 1.6 with minor improvements to the graphics I guess. Gameplay remains the same. Much of the official and even community-created maps from 1.6 are available here as well. There are a good amount of servers up, though this is the least played CS. Deathrun, Gun game, Surf and more custom mods can still be played.The Multiplayer version comes with Tour of Duty. These are small missions in which you assign yourself a team of bots and play rounds against other bots as a Counter-Terrorist until you complete them. As you progress, you will gain points to spend on better bots and have an easier time.Buying Condition Zero also grants you Deleted Scenes. This is where Valve tried to make a single-player version of Counter-Strike. In this campaign, you once again take the role of a Counter-Terrorist, but this time, you are basically solo, ♥♥♥♥ing up Terrorists like Rambo. Your higher-ups pretty much chill outside while you are doing the dirty work. In Deleted Scenes, there are some new items introduced, such as  radio-controlled bombs, cameras and blowtorches. You have to rely on your aim to complete the game, though medkits and ammo packs are not scarce and you will rarely run out of health or ammo.It is bundled with 1.6, so the price is pretty good for 2 great games and I recommend it.

												Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a first-person shooter game from Valve. It is the next installment of the Counter-Strike series. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is basically a slightly improved version of the original Counter-Strike, but with many addition to the game, it can also be considered as standalone expansion pack.Counter-Strike: Condition Zero gameplay is 100% the same with original Counter-Strike. But Counter-Strike: Condition Zero has new Tour of Duty mode, more maps and the new singleplayer campaign named Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes. Tour of Duty is a singleplayer mode game that is basically has the same game mode, but has some challenges objective that needs to be completed to win the map. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero also introduce offline multiplayer bots, where you can play against AI controlled player in offline game.Counter-Strike: Condition Zero graphics is also basically the same as Counter-Strike, only has some improved models, textures and maps, but older maps are still included in the game.Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a good improvements to Counter-Strike. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												Counter-Strike 1.6: The Phantom Pain is a Single Player First-Person Shooter that takes you through the lives of numerous Counter-Terrorism units. The story is linear and all counter-terrorism units depicted are not connected. Most gameplay is a tutorial for a mundane version of VR missions, a prime example being your very first sneeki beeki-like S.A.S mission, where you, the main unoriginal protagonist of Dissappointment Ops 3, is instructed to infiltrate and exfiltrate from Prague or something to stop a train from going boom and to locate Metal Gear Supercomputer.

												Synopsis:With its extensive Tour of Duty campaign, a near-limitless number of skirmish modes, updates and new content for Counter-Strike's award-winning multiplayer game play, plus over 12 bonus single player missions, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a tremendous offering of single and multiplayer content. My thoughts regarding Condition Zero are pretty much Identical to the original CS 1.6. This is basically due to both games sharing the same engine, with Condition Zero being different only in the texturing and meshing department. With CS 1.6 showing its age, Condition Zero might be a worth a squirt if your feeling nostalgic. Basically once the game Is bought you have to two installation options, Counter Strike Condition Zero and Counter Strike Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes.Counter Strike Condition Zero:This is essentially the CS 1.6 variant of the game which allows for traditional CS 1.6 style online gameplay and a somewhat enjoyable mini campaign which spans across most of the original maps, where objectives are the same as multiplayer however you can build a team for each map with bots of varying skills with more powerful bots costing more resource which you will unlock as you complete the maps. This single player should be avoided since it offers no real value and you are much better off playing on servers with real players.Counter Strike Condition Zero Deleted Scenes:This installation covers the actual single player campaign for Condition Zero. Each theater consists of you playing as a different counter terrorist unit: GIGN, GSG-9, SEAL Team 6, SAS and SpetsnazYou in turn fight againest a variety of different terrorist factions:Arctic Avengers, Elite Crew, Guerilla Warfare, Phoenix Connexion and Midwest Militia.I rather enjoyed the single player campaign since it deployed a large variety of maps and global locations ranging from fetid jungles to war ravaged cities. Most missions have a pre deployment briefing but these just offer simple intel and not much else. Most missions range from hostage rescue, bomb disarmament to assassinations. In most respects the campaign is somewhat reminiscent to Call of Duty MW which often puts you in the boots of a different soldier serving under a different army.In conclusion CS CZ is worth your time if you are a hardcore C.S 1.6 fan like myself. It is pretty much HD 1.6 with a enjoyable single player campaign.Final Score: 85/100			"

												This game is awesome!Why you should get it:Counter-Strike: Condition Zero: It is my most favorite Counter-Strike game in the series. Although I never got to experience this game until 2016 because I never heard about it. Added bots, Tour of Duty campaigns, but not the campaigns you think of. You just do the tasks and you beat the level. You play as Counter-Terrorists trying to stop Terrorists. I found out about this game in late 2016. I've been playing CS 1.6 for 10 years now and seeing this as a 1.6 but with  better graphics. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes: Actual campaigns/missions, you get to fight terrorists, again. All I got to say.Get these games, they're worth buying.			"

												I like the game a lot. There is a Singleplayer campaign which I have passed in 2.5h. I will do some pros and cons for the gamePROS-The game comes with another game called Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes-CS:CZDS has only Singleplayer which is very intriguing to pass and play it, it has total of 19 missions and are very well made-And I have liked it of course!-The game has better graphics than Counter-Strike-The game is fun to play even with bots-Developers haven't forgot about this game, the games does not need any updates or patches-Community is strong, so much players on 2500+ dedicated servers-The game is cheap-The Singleplayer Introduces you to all of the maps that are in Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, and introduces it very well-The Multiplayer servers are defended with VAC so there are little to no hackers in this gameCONS-I didn't like some of the Challenges because I have killed terrorists too fast and couldn't save the Hostages so I had to repeat it four to five times-The graphics for player models have changed a little bit but they are still... I don't know how to describe itI recommend this game! I rate it 9/10. Would kill five terrorists in row with M249 again			"

This game (for me) is better than CS:GO (because CS:GO is ☢toxic☢  and i can't run it very well) and better than 1.6 beacuse they are too good. (i dont have CS:S) Here is a little story of mine:First i only wanted to buy CS 1.6 but it could be only bought with this game. Then This Happened:-Opened CS 1.6-Got in to a hungarian server (im hungarian)-Realized that they are too good-quitNow i thought: Lets try this other one out.

												Cory in the House is a television show, which aired on the Disney Channel from January 12, 2007 to September 12, 2008 and was a spin-off from the Disney show That's So Raven. The show focuses on Cory Baxter, who moves from San Francisco, California to Washington, D.C. with his father, after Victor Baxter gets a new job in the White House as the official head chef. The series marks a Disney Channel first, as it is the channel's first spin-off. This is also the only Disney Channel spin-off series to be broadcast in standard definition for the entire length of the show. Reruns of the series have not been produced on Disney Channel, or on Disney XD; however they continue to air on the Family channel in Canada. Raven-Symoné guest-starred, reprising her role as Raven Baxter in one episode. In 2014 Disney Channel started airing a weekly block called Disney Replay on Wednesdays nights, during which episodes of Cory in the House air alongside That's So Raven and Kim Possible, among others.

												10/10 Citizen Kane of gaming, flawless, best game Valve has ever been involved with, perfect. Just kidding, it's pretty awful. At least Valve was nice enough to show this disaster to the public. It's good for some laughs, at how awful the game is.(This was written about the deleted scenes portion of the game)			"

												The more polished, better looking cousin of Counter Strike, Condition Zero is the version of Counter Strike to not only play, but for developers to beat.  The addition of the much-required shield has an important balance factor; it counters the usage of the AWP.The hit detection is once again, superior to CSGO, much like the previous Counter Strike, and the aim for the weapons isn't cartoonishly exaggerated where you have weapons like the M249 and the shotgun being actually viable.Online play is head-and-heels above CSGO's.  In CSGO you feel like everythings a waste of time unless you're playing in competitive matches, while in CSCZ, and CS, pubs rule the game (like all classic multiplayer games).  I can't say how sweet it was when someone who was clearly a CSGO player who looks like he just started playing CSCZ, killed a team mate to defuse the bomb himself, and then got perma-banned by the moderator.  It was also the moment where I realized that the behaviors of players in CSCZ compared to CSGO are not just different, but the CSGO behavior is just ♥♥♥♥ing awful and counter-intuitive to team work.  You have people competing fo points to get a higher rank quicker so that they can unlock more skins, which they can trade/sell for a hugely over-priced margin (some skins being worth more than CSGO itself).I guess it just goes to show that if you're someone who actually wants to enjoy playing the game, CSCZ is the game for you.  CSGO is just another ""competitive"" game with nothing more to it than popularity, driven mostly by the market economy the game has created for itself, suffering the same fate as TF2 and Dota 2.I would recommend CSCZ over CSGO any day and not because it's what I used to play (since I have none, as I barely ever touched it for more than a few minutes back in the day), but because the balance, design, and overall aesthetic is just so much more satisfying and fun to experience compared to more modern online FPS games.

												Buried beneath the successes of Valve's blockbuster titles, Condition Zero is a hidden gem that boasts both singleplayer and multiplayer entertainment. The main reason you should consider this is for the Deleted Scenes section, which contains a variety of content not used by the base game. From a legitimate story mode (with rather cinematic and interesting moments) to fun new weapons (M60's and blowtorches, to name a few), it pretty much is worth the price of admission. The base game is decent as well, but it can be easily replicated by playing CS:S or Global Offensive with bots. Deleted Scenes features a story mode with, well, a story. 18 unconnected stories, sure, but the variety of locations ingame makes up for the lack of consistency.Overall, it's a fun diversion when you're yearning for another story-based game from Valve. At a price of 5-10 dollars, you're basically getting two high-quality games for the price of one. I would recommend it to Counter-Strike and Half-Life fans alike.			"

												Sadly dead.Out of all the Counter-Strike games, this one is probably the most underrated. However, that doesn't make it a bad game in anyway.For one thing, CZ doesn't deliver anything really new into Counter-Strike compared to 1.6.There are a few things they did add.+A Campaign Mode+Re-decorated maps+New Maps+A Mission Mode+New sound effects+Slightly beter graphicsAnd when you compare 1.6 to CZ, they're nearly IDENTICAL.I would only get this for the Campaign and the Mission Mode. For Core Multiplayer CS gameplay, get 1.6. However, if you want to try out the Deleted Scenes campaign, this is worth your time.			"

												This product  consist of two games - Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and Condition Zero - Deleted ScenesCounter-Strike: Condition ZeroUpdated Counter-Strike 1.6!Added HQ-models, updated some maps, with HQ-textures too, and Campaign, which in CS:GO too (operations). But this is usual CS. Unlike official classic version, original Condition Zero have BOTs. 1.6 need to download them from unreliable sources... Horror! But there is a BOTS!!!So, go to the pros & cons.Pros:HQ-textures, doing game world more like CS:GO. if you are bum and CS:GO doesn't run)Detailed new maps.BOTs!!!1!11ONEONE!Campaign.Cons:Shooting mechanics unwonted (spreading of M4A1 restoring after 5 sec.)Just a litle bit changed classic CS. Developer's laziness.But anyway, I don't understand why it takes so poor rating...My mark - 7 bots out of 10.Condition Zero - Deleted ScenesCounter-Strike with a story missions!! Total - 18. The same HQ-models.So, pros & cons.Pros:Detailed models and HQ-textures.18 so interesting story missions.It's a doble pros!New weapons and spy tools. RPG 4life!Cons:The same shooting mechanics.My mark - 9 the best Russian accents out of 10.So, general mark is... 8/10!! "

												Counter Strike Condition Zero is an interesting game to discuss not because of it's merits as a game but largely for it's history. It had a surprisingly troubled development and changed hands between 4 distinctive developers before finally becoming finished. The game was originally designed by Rogue, the developers behind Strife and American McGee's Alice. However the developer went out of buisiness so Valve instead gave it to Gearbox, who Valve had previously worked with on Opposing Force and Blue Shift. Much of the game is based around Gearbox's version, which focused on creating more impressive graphics and remaking many of the classic Counter Strike maps in better detail.However, the project changed hands again and the game was handed off to Ritual entertainment. The guys behind SiN. They remade the game as a pseudo singleplayer title before Valve decided to hand the game off to Turtlerock studios. Who would years later create Left 4 Dead. Who finished the game and completed it based on Gearbox's version. The content Ritual made would be released as the ""Deleted scenes"".The final game is very much inspired by Counter Strike 1.6. It plays very similarly albiet with nicer graphics and a very different art style. It was also the very first Counter Strike game to ship with bots by default. The game also contains a singleplayer separate from the Deleted Scenes, however this is just an Unreal Tournament style ladder featuring botmatches. When Condition Zero came out, it was seen as outdated. It released two years too late, and the very same year as Valve's own Counter Strike Source. As a result it isn't often talked about when compared to the other games. Since you do get it by default when buying 1.6 it's interesting to play for curiosity's sake, but you'll likely find more players for 1.6 or Source.			"

												This is Counter Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes (Beta) Remastered: Reimagined Resurrection II: Electric Boogaloo: Revenge of Saddam Part 3: Osama's Redemption: The CIA's Plan: The Train Mission: Operation Black Tango: Gunship Down: Insurrection Stage 2: Insurgency: The Revenge: 9/11 part 2: Firefighter Spec-Ops Stories: The Pentagon: Zombies: Resurrection II: Time Machine: Aborting Hitler: The Butterfly Effect: Nazis In Space. It is probably my favourite game in the Call of Duty franchise aside from LEGO Star Wars II: Anakin's Repentance. This game is very good if you want an experience similar to playing CS 1.6 with mentally deficient small children that have bad voice acting. My favourite part of this game was the mission ""Miami Heat"", in which you play as a gambler named Nick Jonas who is in search of his long lost lover, but ends up rescuing hostages instead. Or the mission ""Run!"", where a bunch of samurais chase you for your gemstone adorned amulet. Overall I would reccomend this game, if you enjoyed the competetive ""community"" of CS:GO, this game will feel like a big 'ol hugbox.			"

												Rank: 7.5/10Recommendation(s): Be a hardcore Counter-Strike fan, understand the old 1.6 mechanics, and play a little bit of Half-Life.Major Theme: Hidden treasure for CS players.Bought at Price: $100 (for Valve Complete Pack)Single player Counter-Strike was always an interesting concept to throw around. So much in fact, a small studio completed it.A quick reminder, this game was designed around Half Life. Linear gameplay in a compact space should be expected. This doesn't mean its bad - plenty of single player games are linear - it just takes time to understand if you haven't played Half Life. Level layouts and item interaction are not going to be what you are used to. Is the game perfect? No, and no game is. Due to the for mentioned old game design theories, certain pathways and mechanics will seem odd. Getting players to do a 180, and come back the way they came can be confusing.I've always been a Counter-Strike fan. There's no denying that. If you are well, you will have a blast with this title (and the Deleted Scenes). This title brings you back to the roots of CS, which allows for a neat experience. Would you play it again and again because of that? Probably not, because I completed the game in 4 hours and that felt like it was enough. I can only really see someone playing this if they are using an old machine with poor internet connection.Being an old engine, AI isn't very good either. The way around that is to place environmental hazards everywhere such as trip mines. Because of this, it feels more like Half Life then Counter-Strike.To wrap this up, if you are a CS player, you are missing something by not playing this. If you aren't, go on in life, there's nothing demanding here for you to play.			"

												Deleted Scenes Review:This game is one of those , which solves biggest dilemma of Counter-Strike : AK,M4,AWP or P90. Well ,it says ""Decoy u 2"" and allows to carry everything at the same moment, so you will be allowed not to snipe from range of 10 kilometres with your trustful MAC-10. Plus, you can say ""Screw you camper, Imma bazooka the 300 dollars out of you"". If that is not convincing enough, in Latvia you can see dude which plays Condition Zero, when you are playing Condition Zero(Counter-Strike C4-blow). This game is real pain ,like whole P90 team, if you don't like to be Sneaky Beaky Like ...Condition Zero Review:So buying this game actually give you 2 games, which is diffrent like Vertigo and Dust II. When Deleted Scenes was solo #YOLO, Condition Zero is multiplayer one, which is not as good as original 1.6 as few of you think. But I think it's opposite. This game shows best camping skills of bots

A Screenshot of Counter-Strike: Condition Zero
By: Kastlas




 ,just like in CSGO Casual. But their camping skills ain't the best feature of this game. You can tell that Condition Zero made a step foward with most knew voice line of bots ""I'M DANGEEEEEEEROUS"" when they kill nothing.10/10 would enjoy seeing those lines in Global Offensive			"

												Counter Strike CZ should be considered as an upgrade to the the original counter strike, or even the prelude to source. Many maps have been changed and look  better . However, I would say that CZ is geared towards players who don't have a fast internet connection, or lan a lot, since there is a wide emphasis on bots.			"

												Brilliant singleplayer version of Counter-Strike if you're the kind of person that enjoys missions from back in the day where you didn't have to 'pay to win' (or look cool) and receive just the satisfaction of beating a game rather than selling a 5 cent case you earned thinking it was actually worth your time.One niggle I have however is that the bots are pretty useless half the time, especially as the game pretty much depends on them entirely unless you're an expert player that can win 1v6 almost every round.

												Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is basically 'just' a slightly improved version of Counter-Strike 1.6.If you happen to be unfamiliar with the CS games series, the concept of the idea is simple.Players play against eachother in online matches, choosing to play either a terrorist or a counter terrorist. The team that completes their objective or eliminates the opposing team wins.Counter-Strike is a fairly old game, built on the Half-Life engine, that became extremely popular years ago and is one of the best known shooter games (series) ever made, alongside eg. Unreal Tournament, Doom, Call of Duty and other such classics. And thanks to a large community, there is a huge amount of custom content available for these games. As long as you have some people to play with, it's hard to get bored in the world of Counter-Strike. And Condition Zero is no exception to this.What most people familiar with the series can tell you is that while CZ is a decent game, it is highly underrated compared to both older and newer installments. Why is this? Well there may be several reasons, but the easiest way to put it is this: it's the middle child of CS games.CS purists will prefer to play the original Counter-Strike, versions 1.5 and 1.6. And the newer games draw a big crowd because they're flashier and fancier. Since Condition Zero is situated in between the older 1.6 and Counter-Strike: Source (which started using the new Source engine), it doesn't get much of the attention it deserves, in my opinion. However, I can tell you that it is definitely a game worth playing if you're into slightly older shooting games.--------------------More information...-=Gameplay=-Q: How is it played?A: After joining a server, you have four options. You can join one of two teams, you can let the game decide for you which team you'll join or you can spectate the game, basically existing as a ghost, watching others play. You can play as a counter-terrorist operative or as a terrorist. The moment you spawn (when a new round starts, or within seconds of a round starting) you're able to open a menu that allows you to buy weapons, protection and various equipment. If the round has not yet started, you are unable to move. If you picked a team seconds after the round started, you will instantly be able to move. Everyone spawns with a basic pistol and a little bit of money. Once you're able to move, your goal is to move out of the spawn area and attempt to complete any of your objectives to earn more money and to win the round. When the round is over, everyone respawns in the same area as last round and the game is repeated. If you died, you'll start over with your gear, otherwise you keep what you had before. You will keep playing rounds until the server changes to a different map (level), usually after 20 minutes. There are a couple of standard game types, determined not by server options but by the type of map that is being played. The three main types are bomb defusal, hostage rescue and assassination. There are other types, but those are only featured in custom maps. Completing just ONE of the listed objectives will win a team the round and earn additional money for all of it's members.*Bomb defusal-Terrorists must plant a bomb in one of two possible bomb sites and make sure it explodes. (the team still wins if the bomb explodes while all it's members are dead)-Terrorists must kill all counter-terrorists.-Counter-terrorists have to kill all terrorists.-Counter-terrorists must defuse the bomb if it is planted. (the team still wins if all CT players are killed after the bomb has been defused)*Hostage rescue-Terrorists must stay alive and keep the counter-terrorists from rescuing all living hostages.-Terrorists have to kill all the counter-terrorists.-Counter-terrorists have to rescue all the living hostages.-Counter-terrorists have to kill all the terrorists.*Assassination-Terrorists must keep the VIP from the rescue zone while staying alive themselves.-Terrorists have to kill the VIP.-Counter-terrorists have to kill all the terrorists.-Counter-terrorists have to get the VIP player (picked at random) to the rescue zone within a specific time limit.-=Experience=-CZ is an old game. It runs on an old engine. It looks, feels and sounds old. Quite simply, if you can't stand anything but HD graphics, realistic water effects, decent ragdoll physics and other such things, this is not the game for you. That said, there's enough to keep it interesting. Weapons all sound and behave differently and it takes practice to get good with each (type). The maps are diverse enough in types of environment. It's worth mentioning that in a game like this, the maps are relatively small, forcing players into confrontation to keep the game going at a decent pace. Because the action is usually fast and intense, you will usually be too distracted to really notice what your surroundings sound or look like. For some interesting experiences, try a few custom maps! Made by members of the community, you'll find the craziest levels. Themed ones, maps based on popular films or tv series and just insane maps that seem to be all over the place. Shake things up by customising your game and trying out new things.-=Technical, controls, etc.=-Again, CZ is a fairly old game. As long as you can get the game started, you're not going to have issues with this. It's pretty stable and even if you do suffer a bug or error, you will easily find a solution for it through Google, thanks to the large amount of players who have played this and other CS/HL games over the years.It's extremely small compared to modern games and will take up very little space, even if you start adding custom content to it and customising it further. For anyone with a normal internet connection you can download this game very quickly.Controls are what you're used to in PC shooters. Pretty intuitive and unsurprising. Thankfully, if there's anything that is not working how you want it to, you can change it. Controls can be changed in the options menu and if there's anything not listed in there, you can always find a way to fix it by using the developers console. This may sound complicated if you're a casual PC user/gamer, but again, the community has made sure that there's enough information for you to figure things out without spending a lot of time doing research and basically missing out on actually playing and enjoying the game.Besides regular user controls, there are also enough options and commands by default for server owners (you, if you're hosting a game) to keep control of the match. These can be expanded upon greatly by installing an administrative modification on your game (server) and again, there's enough information for anyone with limited computer knowledge to succeed in this endeavour.Pro's:-Basically an improved Counter-Strike 1.6-Extremely and easily customisable with a lot of custom content available-Easy to learn, hard to master-Features working bots (not brilliant ones in gameplay, though) and the game can ""learn"" custom maps and make waypoint files for the CZ bots automatically. They work in multiplayer too-Comes with Deleted Scenes, separate game on the same engine that has you playing a proper SP campaign, going across the world to stop terrorist activity in scripted missions.Cons:-Highly underrated and not well known, will not have as much players as other CS games (best played with friends)-Somewhat pricey, unless you're planning on playing it a lot, despite the content available and given with just the game itself------------------------Visit our steam review group page:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thedairyreviewReviews of games with titles starting with C, and reviews/translations of thisgame (review) by other group members in this thread: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thedairyreview/discussions/0/537405286660678835/ "

												A good way of experiencing Counter-Strike without all the stress of playing with other players. You can assemble a team of bots and fight in different maps, each with different missions to complete (kill people with a certain weapon, rescue hostages etc.) You can create custom mission-packs or download from others.Also, deleted scenes is the badass single-player CS we all wanted. Go for it. You will not regret it.			"

												Cory in the House is a television show, which aired on the Disney Channel from January 12, 2007 to September 12, 2008 and was a spin-off from the Disney show That's So Raven. The show focuses on Cory Baxter, who moves from San Francisco, California to Washington, D.C. with his father, after Victor Baxter gets a new job in the White House as the official head chef. The series marks a Disney Channel first, as it is the channel's first spin-off. This is also the only Disney Channel spin-off series to be broadcast in standard definition for the entire length of the show. Reruns of the series have not been produced on Disney Channel, or on Disney XD; however they continue to air on the Family channel in Canada. Raven-Symoné guest-starred, reprising her role as Raven Baxter in one episode. In 2014 Disney Channel started airing a weekly block called Disney Replay on Wednesdays nights, during which episodes of Cory in the House air alongside That's So Raven and Kim Possible, among others.

												Widely ignored, but better than the previous installment. And it adds bot support. For LAN or party gaming this one is way much better than Counter-Strike. It has revisited maps, bots, better textures and models, more maps, better UI, even single player missions!Since it comes with Counter-Strike in the same bundle, it's a nice addition for everybody who loves this franchise.

												I loved this game. In a game where you spawn, kill, repeat what it needs is goals, a mini story and something to strive for. This is how it's done.I hate the others that think achievements motivate people. THIS is how you do it. And that's why, Valve, this game is a 9 and CS:GO is 7. Keep taking tips for ""pro"" gamers, it's working			"

												CZDS is the franchise's first and only take on single-player campaigns, and it turns out pretty well! It's definitely a fresh new take on the game when it came out over ten years ago, and it still is today.Although most campaigns feels like your usual run and shoot, the pacing is quite balanced with a few puzzle and hostage/defusal/boss shootout battle scenarios insterspread to break the monotony. The maps are also well-made.A few downsides: the NPC's aiming sometimes feels inhuman, and the game incorporates a few stereotypes which are not to my liking.			"

												Counter Strike: Condition Zero seems good at first. A single player Counter Strike experience? A campaign for one of the most played games ever? BOTS? Sign me up, right? Well, it would have been absoultely good if it was made by one company and published by Valve. You see, it was going to be made by one company, but for some reason that I don't know, they gave it to another company. Than ANOTHER company. It just finally ended up at whoever made it today.The game itself is NOT bad. It's actually fun. I quite enjoyed playing the campaign, even though I had no idea what was going on. The only thing that lacked was the ""tour of duty"" thing where you play with bots. It was really short and I beat it in, what, 2 hours?I don't know why people always diss this game. I liked this game.Overall, this game gets a 89/100 for me.			"

												Truly the finest first person shooter to ever grace the PC market. Gearbox has set the bar incredibly high, and since Condition Zero launched nobody has been able to even come close to matching its superb design. The graphics may be a bit dated, but let's just say that when it released, it was without a doubt the ""Crysis"" of its time. If you are a fan of shooters, PC games, Valve, Gearbox, or just good games, you owe it to yourself to buy this game.			"

												Counter-Strike was, initially, a mod for Half-Life. After Half-Life’s success in 1998, and people began to notice that it wasn’t so hard to build mods for it, a small team began working on Counter-Strike. It was released as a free download and began to amass a large number of players. Seeing this, Valve and Sierra adopted the game as their own and began selling it as a standalone online title. It was largely a silly move to buy it; at that time it was easy to find Half-Life for a cheap price and simply download Counter-Strike, since you were going to have to download patches for it even if you bought it. It was a smart business move though, and only fueled the online community.The idea behind Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is that the game deserved a full-fledged offline mode, complete with bots and unique challenges. The game passed from developer to developer over a number of years – at one point even resembling a Half-Life clone with a continuous storyline. The final result, however, is little more than an organized series of missions with specific goals.That’s not to say that it’s all that bad. Counter-Strike’s gameplay is classic, and even all these years later, it’s still fun to play. For all of you – if there are any – who don’t know how Counter-Strike plays, imagine this: you start each round with your team and the ability to purchase weapons and equipment. You then use this stuff to either plant/defuse bombs and rescue/guard hostages; but most of all, you’re there to kill as many enemies as possible. If you live to the next round, you get to keep your gear; if not, you’ll have to wait until one team loses the round and then buy everything over again when you die. That’s Counter-Strike in a nutshell: it is a simple yet fun online game.Each round in the single player game plays out just like an online game. In fact, all rounds follow exactly the same rules as before. There are some new maps, and the old maps have been spruced up a bit with new textures and the occasional out-of-place object. The only other real difference is that you’ll be playing with computer-controlled bots, and you’ll be working to complete certain challenges.Too bad you can not switch sides and play as the Terrorist side.The challenges range from downright dumb to tough-as-nails depending on the difficulty level you’re playing on. Examples from Easy or Normal mode are “Kill one enemy with a sub-machine gun” or “Rescue two hostages.” Examples from the harder modes sound something like “Kill someone with a sniper rifle within 60 seconds and stay alive for the rest of the round.” They get really tough and promise to give even hardcore Counter-Strike players a run for their money. Condition Zero also features “Deleted Scenes,” which are the leftovers from the last developer “Ritual” before they got booted off the project. Unlike Turtle Rock’s portion, the “Deleted Scenes” are an actual campaign style game, although it lacks any sort of story, apart from you being a special ops agent who travels the world fighting “evil-doers.” The only redeeming part about the “Deleted Scenes” is the fact that you play in an all-new environment and not old rehashed CS maps. The bots are surprisingly well done as well. When playing on the easier modes, you can see that at times they’ll deliberately miss, but on the harder levels they will have one hell of a trigger finger. They also know the maps very well; they’ll take advantage of useful locations and take note of dangerous spots. They often stay in groups and communicate using the in-game voices.Since Condition Zero runs on the Half-Life engine, its graphics are considerably dated. It’s not that it looks that bad, but compared to the graphics of today it isn’t anything special. The textures are relatively clean and the framerate is smooth as hell, which are definitely pluses. On the other hand, character models are blocky and lack detail and death animations look pretty darned clunky compared to the ragdoll physics employed today. Overall, the whole thing is more than bearable, but don’t come in hoping for great visuals.The sound still holds up very well, though. Gunshots, explosions, and all of the other sound effects are presented here loud and clear. The voice acting has been redone, with quite a bit of new lines of dialogue and different voices that hopefully distinguish one bot from another. There isn’t much music to speak of, but everything else is perfectly fine.Overall, Condition Zero is a decent game.			"

												I'm actually decently suprised. This is a pretty good game. The only game I've played in the Counter Strike series is CSGO and I'm not a very big fan of FPS games besides CSGO, so you'd probably understand why this impulse buy was such a surprise. I'm not saying this game is for everyone — The graphics heavily resemble those of the Playstation 2 — but I really enjoyed it. Also, if you were curious as to why I only have 5 minutes in the game, Deleted scenes — The game I played — appearantly isn't counted as its own game on Steam, so I had to idle in the base game to write this review.

This part is for The Deleted Scenes Part!This is what Half-life should of been. You play these mini missions and your goal changes on each mission. Sometimes you have to recurse a hostage or defuse a bomb, or stop a drug lord. Each mission gives you different weapons and tools to use. Also some of those weapons have a flashlight on them so use them in dark areas if you want. Each mission has its own small story to it and its own cast of characters. Also each mission takes place in different areas. You could be in the U.S for one then in Japan in another mission. I had more fun with this game then I did with HL1.This part is for stock CZ!Single player mode has you playing on maps with a set goal(s) in which you have have to complete to move on to the next one. Unlike Deleted Scenes which hands you the weapons, you have to buy the weapons yourself just like in a normal round of CS, also you can hire AI controlled npcs to help and each have their own pros and cons. Some listen to commands better while others don't, some are good with weapons and some are more braver then others. Other then that its normal CS and I had some fun. Your mileage may vary tho.			"

												Awesome game. Adds to the fantastic gameplay of the original with bots and single-player. The AI of the bots is a bit clunky now and then but it positively contributes significantly to the game. The Tour of Duty missions are just matches with bots with extra challenges. Adds to extra replayability.8/10 - Pretty Damn Good.			"

												Absolutely amazing, pure HD, crisp graphics. Looks better than real life, so much my friends thought i was playing Far Cry 3. The Gameplay is stunning, it takes drama, stealth, action and sex and morphs it into an amazing game. This is the greatest masterpiece ever in the history of gaming, better than Half-Life by a HUGE margin. a Guaranteed 100/100.			"

												In Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, you play a cop named Carl Winslow. As Captain of the Chicago P.D., you are the best of ""the Prairie State."" President Clinton drafts you into S.E.A.L team six, a promising squadron of the United States' finest. Your mission is to kill as many sand terrorists as possible. *In the game, you get to do awesome things like: disarm bombs, rescue hostages, buy weapons, and kill. *The graphics in this game are true-to-life, and require today's bestest and beastiest PCs to play it.*Counter-Strike: Condition Zero has a spin-off (and less successful) game called ""Counter-Strike 1.6,"" a fan mod. The mod's *latest version, v 1.7 has been in nine years in development and is yet to come out.V: 5 large popcorns and a medium Coke.A: 6/6This isn't your dad's shoot-'em-up.			"

												Right, let's try this again shall we? But first, cast your mind back to issue 132 of PC ZONE. It was the one with the words 'Exclusive Review: Counter-Strike: Condition Zero' emblazoned on the front cover, replete with a balaclava-clad man about to be unwittingly run over by three helicopters. Inside was a six-page review - or should I say lamentation - about how the game was nothing like we'd expected it to be.The thing was, right up until the moment the review code plopped onto our desks - and despite development having changed hands from Gearbox to Ritual - we'd been led to believe that Condition Zero would comprise of a group of ever-harder missions, in which you and a team of intelligent AI-controlled counter-terrorist bots would battle it out across a set of maps against terrorist forces in either bomb defusal or hostage rescue missions. So basically, just like online Counter-Strike, only with bots and personal tasks to complete in each map.			"

												Gamers who don't already own the frenetic Counter-Strike should be attracted to this new game as a good introduction that helps them transition into serious online competitors. Gamers who already accomplished Counter-Strike players will find the offline component somewhat novel but not indispensable. It certainly doesn't do enough to compete with today's shooters and the fact that much of the game is already available in another format makes this version seem a bit redundant.			"

												If you are looking for a hard freaking core trainer to getting better at other counter strikes, here is where you should start. You will start out with bots that are super easy, but as you progress and get to the levels on hard difficulty they will be so freaking hard. I have only pumped about a dozen hours into this and it has DEFINANTLY helped me with my accuracy and problem solving skills on global offensive. This counter strike is considered to be the worse, but I can tell you it is FAR from that. I would reccomend getting this game for training to be better on other CS games, or to just have and extremelly fun and VERY challenging single player experience. This game is a must buy for PC gamers. Make sure to tweek the setting so even people with the crappiest PC's can play it at a rock solid 60 frames per second. Trust me, worth the buy.			"

												Right, let's try this again shall we? But first, cast your mind back to issue 132 of PC ZONE. It was the one with the words 'Exclusive Review: Counter-Strike: Condition Zero' emblazoned on the front cover, replete with a balaclava-clad man about to be unwittingly run over by three helicopters. Inside was a six-page review - or should I say lamentation - about how the game was nothing like we'd expected it to be.The thing was, right up until the moment the review code plopped onto our desks - and despite development having changed hands from Gearbox to Ritual - we'd been led to believe that Condition Zero would comprise of a group of ever-harder missions, in which you and a team of intelligent AI-controlled counter-terrorist bots would battle it out across a set of maps against terrorist forces in either bomb defusal or hostage rescue missions. So basically, just like online Counter-Strike, only with bots and personal tasks to complete in each map.			"

												In Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, you play a cop named Carl Winslow. As Captain of the Chicago P.D., you are the best of ""the Prairie State."" President Clinton drafts you into S.E.A.L team six, a promising squadron of the United States' finest. Your mission is to kill as many sand terrorists as possible. *In the game, you get to do awesome things like: disarm bombs, rescue hostages, buy weapons, and kill. *The graphics in this game are true-to-life, and require today's bestest and beastiest PCs to play it.*Counter-Strike: Condition Zero has a spin-off (and less successful) game called ""Counter-Strike 1.6,"" a fan mod. The mod's *latest version, v 1.7 has been in nine years in development and is yet to come out.V: 5 large popcorns and a medium Coke.A: 6/6This isn't your dad's shoot-'em-up.			"

												Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is the singleplayer addition to the timeless classic: Counter-Strike. The game adds a singleplayer campaign, bots, and graphical polish. While the game itself is very similar to the original Counter-Strike it adds many needed features that the first game lacked. For starters the new graphical polish that the developers added (I think there were something like 4 total devs) makes the game much more believeable and more fun to play. I felt the the developers really took the time to make sure the weapons were as close to real as possible. Because of this the game feels much more tactical than the first. In my personal opinion, this is the most tactical CS game you will find (when I say that I am excluding CS:GO). As for the bots they could've used a bit more work. From todays standards the bots are everything but smart. They often have trouble deciding whether they want to climb a ladder or not and frequentely stare at the wall hoping something exciting will happen. While these bugs are excusable for the age of the title, they do detract from the game. The singleplayer campaign is good and fun to play at times. If you are confused as to what to expect on the singleplayer campaign picture Half-Life but in the Counter-Strike world. Basically if Valve wanted to make CS a singleplayer game they probably would have done it similarly to how it was done in this campaign. It can be fun and actually quite exciting but anything far from challenging. The most challenge you will get out of the campaign is a big enemy with lots of armor and a machine gun.If you are a beginner looking for a introduction to the world of Counter-Strike, this is the way to go. The bots are a perfect difficulty for any new player and the game maintains the feel of the original Counter Strike. Overall Rating: 8/10For my full Counter-Strike review please click on this link: http://steamcommunity.com/id/RYNOMAN/recommended/10/ "

												Not a whole lot offered here that you can't get from 1.6. Condition Zero creates a whole bunch of scenarios on the already-established maps and game assets, such as getting a certain number of kills during a match or rescuing all hostages. Condition Zero adds a strategic element to the classic Counter-Strike formula by having you pick your computer-controlled squadmates, each with their own levels of skill. You start with some rather mediocre backup, but as you progress in the game, you gain access to more skilled teammates. Balancing your team out and finding players that have their own strengths and can fill in your gaps makes the bots feel more useful. If single-player is your gig when it comes to Counter-Strike, this is a good expansion. However, if you're already deep into 1.6 or you only play online, then this isn't for you.			"

												Hello Fellow Soldiers,I strongly recommend Counter-Strike: Condition Zero! It's everything you love about Counter-Strike except it's more mission based! This means that you are trying to finish missions and assemble the best team possible! I strongly recommend it as it is different from your other Counter-Strikes in that there are missions. It's a lot of fun finishing them and getting better teammates. There are also self-objectives for each mission such as ""Get a kill with a sniper rifle."" Great game, definitely worth the money!-Kyle James			"

												(Purchasing this game comes with Counter-Strike 1.6. It's a good deal now, but back in 2004, I doubt many would pay 40 dollars for *just* Condition Zero.)Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is the one Counter-Strike game everyone seems to never talk about. Passing four development teams (Rogue Entertainment - Gearbox Software - Ritual Entertainment - Turtle Rock Studios) and taking four years to complete because of this, this game barely made it out of development hell, and was not well received.This game was going to be more than it currently is, although some things did get in it, such as the Galil, the FAMAS and the Tactical Shield. Don't forget that the idea for a second LMG (M60 - the Negev in CS:GO is close to Gearbox's planned iteration for the M60 stat-wise too), the Grenade section in the Buy Menu, and Molotov Cocktails from CS:GO all originated in Condition Zero.While we will never get to experience the ""true"" Condition Zero, let's have a look at what eventually got released.Bots: The first Counter-Strike game to feature bots (on PC - Counter-Strike: Xbox was actually the first). They aren't the best, but they play well. Gearbox's version was basically going to have an advanced PODBot, as Markus Klinge was given access to the engine. While this was tested in a beta back in 2003, these bots did not make it to the final version of the game, Turtle Rock Studios' did. Personally, I wish that beta was uploaded somewhere, I'd love to test out the ""enhanced"" PODBots. (P.S: PODBot works on Condition Zero, so if you'd like those instead; http://podbotmm.bots-united.com/main_pb_page/index.htm)_cz maps: While Condition Zero was going to have new, original maps, those got scrapped in favour of ""_cz"" maps, which are graphical improvements of the Counter-Strike 1.6 versions. Some new maps do appear in Condition Zero, but the number of them does not reach the one that was going to be in other iterations of the game.Detail Textures: These were developed for Counter-Strike: Xbox, but they were later included in Condition Zero. While these did ""update"" the look of the game, when compared to other Valve titles which were to release a couple of months later (Half-Life 2/Counter-Strike: Source), these were nothing. Tour of Duty: A very simplified edition of Gearbox's campaign. Involves simple tasks, such as ""Kill 4 enemies with [weapon]"". There are six Tours of Duty in this game mode and each one consists of three different maps. You aren't alone in these missions however, as you can select up to five (bot) teammates to help you. The bots are divided in to five groups by cost; cost 1, cost 2, cost 3, cost 4, and cost 5 - with the cost being that of ""Reputation Points"".Deleted Scenes: Ritual Entertainment's campaign, with a few edits. The AI is a bit wonky, but the campaign is fully playable. Features factions that were only seen on Counter-Strike: Xbox, such as the Akunin. (this comes with any purchase of Condition Zero, despite it being ""another"" game in your library)Mod Support: While this appears in all Counter-Strike games (albeit limited in CS:GO), it's still worth mentioning, as many games don't have it.Dedicated Servers: Same as mod support, but still worth mentioning, especially if you aren't a fan of matchmaking.______________________________________________________________Conclusion: Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a good game, but it could have been much more. I'd recommend it if you'd enjoyed the old (GoldSource) Counter-Strike games, especially since it comes with Counter-Strike 1.6, which is loved by many.			"

												So, as it seems, CS:CZ is suppose to be a singleplayer game, along with traditional multiplayer mode almost identical to one found in the previous CS instalment, the infamous 1.6. As a player who actually likes playing against bots in online games, such as Counter-Strike (any), Team Fortress 2, FoF, Quake Live, Quake 3 and Quake 3: Team Arena, the whole ""singleplayer element"" found in CS:CZ is really, really bad in my humble opinion.The gameplay is just like your traditional Counter-Strike but with predifined number of bots and ""tasks"" instead. The player is given several tasks which MUST be accomplished in order to pass the mission. Unfortunately, majority of these tasks are absolutely what the player SHOULDN'T be doing in a regular CS match. Here are some examples:1. Kill x players2. Kill x players with a specific gun3. Kill x players with a specific gun and survive the round4. Win below x seconds5. Rescue x/all hostagesSo, here's my explanation to the following points respectively:1. Barely any progresss will be made if player's playstyle won't be shifted from cooperative towards tryhardish, with the former being much more welcome in online games. That means, in CS:CZ campaign the player must play aggressively, lone-wolfing, making him prone to dying. Of course, the player may remain cooperative but it will very likely result in a rather unwelcome prolonging of the mission.2. In order to perform well, players should always use weapons they feel comfortable with/high tier weapons, however in this case the player MUST use a specific weapon (usually a fitting one for the map though). Sure, game forces us to try out different guns but in reality the players usually stick to Deagles, AWPs and M4/AK47 for the most of the time anyways. Perhaps that's the task, but still a crappy one, considering players have their most favorite and hated guns, which will never be chosen in an online game anyway.3. Same as above but this time with an opportunity to actually fail the task, forcing the player to be stuck with whatever gun he/she has to stick with for even longer until he/she finally manages to score required amount of frags and also survive the round.4. Another tryhard gameplay promotion. Frag opponents in shortest time possible, meaning, the player must rush B like a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in order to pass the mission. At least it is somewhat challenging at times but again highly discouraged in traditional CS matches.5. The absolute worst of all tasks, since AI controlled hostages can easily get stuck, yet the task will be only ticked off when all of the hostages are rescued. Here's a number of things that can easily prevent player from accomplishing this task:a. Hostage gets stuck and it is no longer reachable (like jumping from a balcony/roof but the hostage doesn't follow). Even if reachable, it's extremely tedious to go back and it also increases chances of encountering an opponent, which can make player's ordeal completely null and void.b. Player manages to get to the hostages, takes them with him/her but bots suddenly frag the very last terro, triggering the win-by-elimination victory.c. hostages get in the way during gunfight, potentially making player stuck, giving terro an opportunity to score a frag and obviously preventing player from finishing this task in this very round. The loss might have an impact on the next round, reducing the chance of accomplishing the task even further.Summary:CS:CZ is a lazy attempt at CS singleplayer mode, full of solutions that are plain wrong and boring. Better stick to a regular game with bots and play as you wish. It could have been much better if it would have taken Half-Life's approach. Instead we have a game. barely different from any of the other CS games but instead with bots and boring, forced tasks. Tedious. That's all that can be said about the campaign. As a singleplayer game I do not recommend it. As a multiplayer game, you better off stick to CS 1.6 instead.			"

It's a completely unnecessary remake of the original CS 1.6.The graphics are marginally better, the gameplay is exactly the same, maybe some changes to weapons' stats or so but not really noticeable.The ""campaign"" consists of playing ordinary Counterstrike matches with some specific goals like ""Kill 4 enemies with the Bullpup"" or ""Save all hostages"". You are accompanied by the most annoying and frustrating Bots in Video game history. The other team consists of Bots as well. Their skilllevel either stupid as a rock or stupid as a rock with lightning fast reflexes and godlike accuracy.It's not suited for training for online multiplayer since no human being behaves like that.Multiplayer is almost dead. Play 1.6 instead.			"

												It may be old, but it sure is still as fun as I remember it when I was younger. Its like Half-Life, but not as good. But still really fun. It comes with 2 games: Counter Strike: Condition Zero and Counter Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes. Deleted scenes has npcs and storyline, the main game... Is basically Counter-Strike with bots and challenges. If it weren't for Deleted Scenes, it would be pretty bad. I give this the stamp of approval, as well as a 7 out of 10!			"

 #LittleLycanOnSteam   Hello Reader  , If You Are Reading This Review, Don't Keep Your Hopes High As It's Not A Review As Such But My Feelings About Any Games Including This One. I May Have Played Or Not Played This Game, Still I Will UpVote It As I Know How Much Efforts, Blood And Sweat Is Used To Make Any Sort Of Game, Irrespective To Big Or Small, Branded Or Small Devs. I Personally Do Not Have Time To Play All Games, So I Just Idle Them, No Offence, Just For The Cards But I Know That The Game Is Worth Shot Even If Not Worth Our Time As It Requires Tremendous Efforts To Make Even The Simplest Of All Games. God Bless All The Game Developers, You Guys Are Great Because You Guys Make Games And Games Are Life For Gamers And Stressbuster For The Working People. Thank You!- #LittleLycanOnky #January2017			"

												This is the same game as Counter-Strike except it includes single-player mode, slight graphical tweaks, and new maps. I mostly play it for the single-player mode as the effectiveness of the AI makes it for a really fun and engaging experience for a while. Hardly anyone plays the multiplayer, you have 1.6 and Source for that. But within its lengthy development time, all the developers did significantly was add bots to an already made game. You can't help but feel disappointed but nevertheless, the game is included with your purchase of 1.6 (which is worth buying at some point) and for that, I recommend it.6/10 - ABOVE AVERAGE			"

It is also one a revolution in this of the games online since the change of graph is very well-known between(among) the Condition Zero and the first Counter-Strike and its alone realism overcome by the Counter-Strike: Source.

												this was the first counter-strike to include bots, it also has a campaign mode where you kill people and do objectives like rescuing hostages...But you can get nexon zombies for free so you might not need to get this seeing as there both nearly the same....but if your a fan of counterstrike, get this with the deleted scenesAlso, surfing is a ton more fun in this, surfing whilst killing people LOL			"

It is also one a revolution in this of the games online since the change of graph is very well-known between(among) the Condition Zero and the first Counter-Strike and its alone realism overcome by the Counter-Strike: Source.

												The CS:CZ is not bad but isn't more significantly improved to the original. The new bumpmap textures, training camp, new models and maps are fine, though.As for the Deleted Scene part, I would consider it as a bonus DLC for CS:CZ. The Deleted Scene is generally a Single Player game based on CS but it contains a cool Fibre Optic Camera attached PDA and a blow torch to sneak and peak inside enemy lines.If you are a huge CS fan, buy it and I find this game OK but maybe a waste as CS 1.6 and CS:CZ are almost identical.

												Wait... i did not reviewed this yet? omg...:CS just like 1.6 but... with small map changes and... same♥♥♥♥♥♥all over again...EXCEPT: great awesome singleplayer campaignThese 80 hours i played this game was 95% spent on single player campaign, which gives unique experience of small missions besides the match. There are 18 maps to play on those campaign (classics like dusts or aztec but also forgotten maps like chateau). Games are pretty much about getting better score, just like in any other CS with some changes:- Teammates Selection - Before the match starts, you get an option to choose up to 5 teammates. Each teammate costs points, which you get for winning the maps. Each bot is prefering different weapon, has different skill level, differently play as team, different bravery. So if you are playing map like aztec, you should get some snipers and on office get some guys with higher teamplay skills.- Mini-Objectives - While you play the match, you have usually 3 main mini-missions to finish during the match. Easier ones are like to get few kills with specific weapon, harder are to kill flash-blinded enemy. Sometimes you will have to kill two guys with pistol and survive the round, one of the hardest is even to kill an enemy with knife. To win the match, you have to finish all those objectives and be 2 wins ahead of terrorists. However, if you let them be 2 wins ahead, you loose and you can start all objectives over.Campaign is only playable as Counter-Terrorists, but there are a lot of downloadable campaigns, you can even easily make your own with your own bots and custom maps.+++ Single Player Campaign - you wont find anything like this in any other CS+- Its pretty old game, so graphics is just fine.- Forget multiplayer, i guess its not alive in this game80/100			"

												OOPS AIR is an airline company that is featured in a plane crash map. How 'bout it. Probably comes with CS:CZ Deleted scenes, can't remember, either way that's what COD should of been and you're only sacrificing graphics.CS:CZ features a tour of duty campaign allowing you to manage a team with ratings on skill, bravery and cooperation, meaning you can argue with AI by spamming COVER ME to no result. Oh and adventures on classic and our favourite maps.Features more than the new games.Pick it up, what else can you do with 9.99 dollars or something, maybe grab a couple sodas but they don't last or feature guns. Or don't, get those sodas if you want, but I recommend this.End.			"

												Very nice job after the cs1.6 some better graphismes but still not good enough for the current games that were going out at the time.It's sad that the gameplay was inferior to the cs1.6 this is one of the reasons cs1.6 stood at 1st palce and that's probably why we couldn't go to eSport with that one.Anyway I still recomend this game at 90% of cs players, for the fun and old memories !

												I remember being given this game on disk by my uncle. It was a great feeling. The game itself was renowned and reading the reviews that were illustrated on the front of the packaging reassured me that this wasn't going to fail me. At first, I didn't play very much of it due to PC complications; after that I then started to play again. I began with the mission, I thought they were great and wished they were brought out to the later games like Source which I love dearly, sadly I was brought down. The missions, in my opinion, were a great addition to Condition Zero especially when you would rage quit multiplayer being hunted down by pros. The missions offered great customization on what teammates you were going to be battling with. Once chosen your teammates you were given a map and then it was left up to you and your teammates to either defuse the bomb or to rescue the hostages. Condition Zero was my first Counter-Strike, people regard CS 1.6 as the original and better game and I have to disagree. Condition Zero in my opinion offered good hitboxes along with fairly accurate registration, apart from defusing bombs haha.			"

												It might be different from the original Counter Strike but condition zero is hands down THE best counter strike ever, the tours of duty are so fun they will keep you occupied for days on end waiting to finish that one challenge. The graphics hold up to date and don't look bad. Finally to make it even better it has most of the original maps from Counter Strike. All in all i would give this game a smooth 9/10.			"

												This is definitely the best of all the Counter-Strikes, including Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. CSCZ has a package system that allows you to preset four packages, each of which can have up to six price options. Just enter the buy menu and click on one of the four and you'll automatically buy the best option you can afford. For example, my four packages are Leech, Headshotter, Gunner, and Shotguneer.			"

												I remember back in 2010 when I got my first true gaming platform (computer-wise) my friend gifted me this game and I played it on and off for it was the only first few games I had on Steam since I was new to the community. This game is fun and although I won't play it anymore since I have Counter-Strike Source this game was a part of me involving myself into the Steam community and becoming a Steam user.Great game to shoot and kill people and great with many mini-games that the community has made up. If I was you though, I'd buy Global Offensive (I haven't bought it, I still have Source) because within this review the playerbase has that has logged into this game in the past 24 hours has been 1316 people and for Global Offensive it has been 292,836 people in the past 24 hours.Counter Strike Condition Zero playerbase: http://steamcharts.com/app/80 (lowest)Counter Strike: Source playerbase: http://steamcharts.com/app/240 (mid)Counter Strike Global Offensive playerbase: http://steamcharts.com/app/730 (highest)			"

												This is a GREAT fun multiplayer game, but you need time to figure the map and the guns and the load outs ... I will have a little rant though, about a VIP player called ""Peabody"" ... this guy BANNED me for THREE days on the UGC server for having a little sing for no more than 10-15 seconds ... he didnt warn me ... he didnt say stop it .... ok on his defense it was britney spears BUT common MAN dont JUST ban people ... anyway when I went back on five days later I saw him and I called him out saying WHY did you ban me? you could have told me to shut up or MUTED me for an hour or BANNED me for 30 minutes ... I would have gotten the message i'm not a newby (well a little lol) i have been playing in this server for over 500hours .... anyway WITHOUT A NOTICE HE PERMANANTLY BANNED ME!! ... ok i did call him a D**K BUT he deserved it for what he did previously without a warning.Anyway its over now and I can spend the time not enjoying this server and friends I play with on there including Alfantander, Retro, pointless, rocked, x.e.y.w.a.n.i. (yeah its spelt like that) and loads ot other guys i cannot remember their names on the server but all cool guys ... ANYWAY ... WATCH OUT for PEABODY!! and its in the UGC server de-dust2 .... apart from HIM! the game and ppl are cool.			"

												This is what happens when you have 3 cooks in the kitchen and take too long to get a game out. Compared to Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike: Source, which both came out in the same year as this game (2004), Condition Zero offers practically nothing. The game was so bad during development that Valve even reverted its ""gold"" status and changed developers on the project 3 times. The result is that very few ideas feel consistent and connected. Single-Player experience? You just get a bunch of bot matches with arbitrary and unimaginative restrictions and goals to complete missions that are not connected in any way (there isn't even any pretend story). The nicest word I can use for the sense of progression is ""limited"". Also, when you finish the game, there's just... nothing. Multi-player experience? This game plays exactly like Counter-Strike 1.6, but partitions the players instead of just offering the campaign as an expansion (similar to Diablo II and Diablo II: LoD, which also came out around the same time). There are some exclusive maps, but I failed to see how any of them were an improvement to their CS 1.6 counterparts. Even if the maps were enough of an incentive, it was a pretty low effort endeavor for someone to copy-paste them into the CS 1.6 workshop. This means that you essentially had 2 versions of CS going on at one time, except one of them costed extra so people just stuck with 1.6 instead lol.Graphics? They look like hot garbage compared to the other games from Valve that came out at the same time (Half-Life 2 and CS: Source). The game looks like it was made in 1998.I got this as part of the Counter-Strike complete package during a Steam Sale, and it felt like an incredible chore to finish. There is a video from a recent CS:GO major talking about the history of Counter-Strike, and they mention how ""Source is almost forgotten in CS history"". Funny how they comment on that while actually omitting CS:CZ from CS history. Honestly, this game is an embarassment.			"

												Pretty good addition to the CS franchise, although not the best.The graphics are slightly improved, which is a plus, and there's a bit more variety in weapons (mostly skinned though), but there's also a lot of bugs.The added ""Singleplayer""/Bot mode alone is enough to buy this game, but the addition of the Deleted Scenes Singleplayer (kind of wonky at that) puts the icing on the cake.Multiplayer is very much the same as CS 1.6.It's more like if CSS and CS 1.6 had a child.Still, pretty good.

												You'd think this is a fun singleplayer offline version, but it's really not.  Bots on your team can't aim at all, and bots on the other team have superhuman accuracy.  On top of that, the game gives you stupid missions to accomplish such as using garbage weapons to score kills with like using a low tier smg on a long-distance map, or using a low-tier sniper rifle on a close quarters map.  Maybe if they paid you to play this, it would be worth your time, but the idea of paying for it is laughable.			"

												Condition Zero was the last GoldSource game published by Valve. The development of CZ began in 2001 by Rogue Entertainment and was passed to Gearbox Software (Half-Life: Opposing Force), then Ritual Entertainment (SiN), and finally Turtle Rock Studios (L4D/L4D2). While Turtle Rock Studios' later collaborations with Valve, the two Left 4 Dead games, were a big success CZ didn't turn out so well. This hyped singleplayer Counter-Strike title gave us nothing more than a mappack, most of which were just remasterings of 1.6 maps, which had to be completed with the aid of friendly A.I. You have to assemble your team of counter terrorists in CZ, the better bots being more expensive in in-game currency than the weaker ones. Once your squad is all set you're off to beat terrorists X amount of times on a certain map to continue to the next map to do the same exact thing. The main flaw with this campaign is that in order to progress the player must often partake in counter-intuitive challenges, such as killing three enemies with the auto shotgun while surviving the round. It takes what could have been a nice simple campaign and making it very tedious and overly long. Hey, if Turtle Rock wanted a longer game, they easily could have whipped up more maps. Most of the maps in this game are slight redisgns of Condition Zero Deleted Scenes. Oh, speaking of which:Condition Zero Deleted Scenes is an unfinished but functional version of Ritual's CZ. It's a mission pack of 18 levels and 99% of its assets are recycled in Turtle Rock's CZ. Deleted Scenes is a great campaign with mod support.In conclusion, Condition Zero isn't that good but it's a worthy buy for Deleted Scenes. Valve must have known CZ wasn't as good as its Deleted Scenes since most of the advertisements show Deleted Scenes levels.			"

												Well... I can say for certain they didn't even try.The game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you like hard games in where they pretty much spawn a bomb in your face and you have 0.03seconds to respond - this is the game for you.I'm not joking, they will throw♥♥♥♥♥♥in your face and you have ZERO time to react. And if you fail - you die.Not to mention you can't skip some ""cutscenes"" which eats up your time. They aren't often but when you constantly die to random BS they throw onto you - which you can't react to and kills you - you will be forced to wait every single time when you JUST WANT TO PLAY THE DAMN GAME!This game is poorly done, not at all something I would play if it wasn't for the old CS1.6 style.Which is really the ONLY thing this game has going for it, nostalgia.I don't want to♥♥♥♥♥♥on this game too much as it does have some good elements, besides what I just mentioned, there are good parts to this game.The levels are awesome and it plays and feels like CS1.6. Which is what I wanted when I bought the game. This game isn't even all that expensive, so even tho the game has this constant annoying flaw, I at least didn't pay 60$ for a piece of crap.			"

												The online is pretty barren at this point. The servers that are up are mostly outside the US or running mods that probably suck. But there are some reasons this maybe the last real ""Counter Strike"" game as the later ones went to Source and the problems relative to that. Aswell as far reaching but in reality small changes made in CSGO and CSS that really make it very very diffrent than the older games when in play.Graphically CS and CS:CZ are pleasant looking, simplistic, whats good for a competative shooter game. Its easy to see enemies. Models look pleasant, and its still has some really great 3D sound effects.Suffice to say if this game had slightly better controls, matchmacking or was updated to have these features it would probably be alot more lively than it is today. Or even add those features for standard CS. I would rebuy or pay extra for that.CS:CZ and CS come together if you buy them and they would make a terrific LAN game.If you want something to play single player all you will get from here is Bot Matches (Bots are really good for a multiplayer game in CZ and better than CSGO bots). CZ Deleted scenes is included but this is basically an unfinished old game thats just not good at all but really had some capability to be pretty good but unfortunately they didn't further its development so its crap.If you want a multiplayer game for online play with random people around the globe, CS or CSGO would be a better choice since both of those seperately have way more players than this game.

												I bought 1.6 and I noticed ""Condition Zero"" and ""Condition Zero Deleted Scenes"" popped up in my library.  That's a plus, it comes for free with the original counter-strike.Condition Zero is amazing.  It's the Counter-Strike gameplay we all expect, but with a teambuilding menu and a campaign that bears similarities to Unreal Tournament 2004.  Across all the different maps, you'll be fighting the terrorists with your co-op bots, all of which have custom statistics, weapons and stats for Skill, Bravery, and Co-op.  The AI is competent and even unforgiving, minus the annoying standoffs between T's and a riot shielding bot, and the game remains a lot of fun as you have a 'tour' of each map with multiple side-objectives and a round counter.  If you can win three rounds and be ahead by two, and complete your objectives, you move onto the next round.  Trying to balance out easy victories versus, say, completing a round in 75 seconds or getting three tactical shield kills, is surprisingly difficult at times and gives the game a lot of replay value as each difficulty has a new set of objectives (don't even bother with Expert).Now, let's talk about CZ Deleted Scenes.  I've always wondered if Valve ever considered making a Half-Life style campaign for Counter-Strike.  It seems like such an excellent idea... and this seems to be a direct message to me saying ""Been there, Done that.""  That's right, this is a campaign, complete with events and mission-specific objectives.  In Counter-Strike.  That's where the praise ends, becuase Deleted Scenes is atrocious.  Don't get your hopes up like I did, it's one big steaming turd of broken hitboxes, amazingly horrible voice acting, and OCCASIONALLY showing a small amount of promise as a good game before more turds go into the fan.--These two games along with 1.6 knock GO out of the park.  If you want a Counter-Strike game for both online and offline, look no further than the CS 1.6 + CZ bundle.  Probably some of the greatest $10 you'll ever spend.  Also, there's no chance of an MP shutdown, since Valve holds the servers up with Steamworks to this day-- not that it would shut down, 1.6 is 20,000 concurrent players strong at all times.EDIT: Okay, maybe 30,000 50,000 people... not bad for a game from the 90's.

												Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is the first official sequel to mod Counter-Strike, released in retail in 2004. It was pretty much same Counter-Strike on same engine and minimal changes when it comes to multiplayer experience, but it had more to often to solo players, with addition of bots and ""Deleted Scenes"" pack of single-player missions.Now, for multiplayer community... Is as good as ever. While it's not on the level of Counter-Strike 1.6, you will still be able to find few almost-full servers, whetever it's yet another De_Dust2 map or some server that actually rotates maps. Just more smaller tighter community. BUT it's kinda way too high-skilled by now for newbies to be able to enter in easily.So, when it comes to the main, expected, multiplayer part of the game, it didn't recieve many changes. Explosive grenades are stronger. Hostages are a bit more realistical. The end.Oh, and you will ntoice that graphics got a small boost, as far as HL1 engine goes (""GldSrc""). Models got more detail to them. Few tweaks here and there. Maps are much interesting as far as graphical design goes. If you are going to play de_dust2 non-stop then better do it at the less bland one.And yes, I don't really like Counter-Strike realistical gameplay much here either.Now, for single-player, you finally get some bots to play with. Which are less frustating for new people than online play and helps to hone aiming skills as well better. Though, while they navigate through default maps quite nicely, they don't always make best decision. As a protip, always send them a voice command to stick together, team. They also try not to steal your fun of defusing bomb, waiting for commander to do it, even if said commander is in opposite end of map. Yes, it's a flaw.And like Quake 3 Arena and UT, CZ single player consist of repeated matches with bots, as you will progress through trio of maps, being able to pick less and less stupid teammates over time, always being on side of Counter-Terrorists. And on each map, you have to have more than 2 wins over score of Terrorist team and have to complete each of three objectives, which go like ""rescue <x> hostages"", ""kill <x> amount of Terrorists yourself"", ""finish some round in <x> time"" and ""kill <x> terrorists with <y> weapon"".  So, fun for a while, but more of ""just so something was there"".And now for Deleted Scenes. This is what Counter-Strike: Condition Zero was supposed to be at some point, a full-blown single-player campaign. It was ""cancelled"" once Valve saw magazines giving it low ratings to preview, just to have it put along as bonus into final game. All just to get low ratings once again due to being ""more of same"". Deleted Scenes had 12 missions in retail release, with Steam version adding 6 more that you can select anytime from World Map.Now, Deleted Scene is a mix of good and bad. The excellent level design and repetive core gameplay.First, good things. Level design is quite good one. You will have to take control of unnamed heroes of counter-terrorist operations all over the world, with missions having great variety, with enough lenght to keep you playing, having to stop terrorists from taking over nuke in snowy part of Russia, defending yourself in Arabain town or fighting your way through the jungles. Seriously, some of the missions just have a bit of that scripted hollywood love that would make them worthy of being in Call of Duty and alikes, quite epic! Levels themselves are also build with knowledge of pacing and a bit of exploration, albeit linear.And it really tries to push GldSrc engine! In order to make it look like it's capable of more than expected, developers made a lot of animations of death for terrorists as well as destruction animations. Hell, I was amazed to see a stack of boxes getting squeezed by a door in the third mission, it's all quite joy to look at even if it's scripted. And well, it does hurt occasionally when it comes to enemies deaths. Like, when you shot with pistol at melee enemy into knee and he suddenly teleported half-meter away to the door, swirled and fell toward the door, just to get it open.But core gameplay of Counter-Strike doesn't translate well at all into linear levels of single-player. What you bassicly will do, is to shoot few bullets into heads, while taking some hitscan bullets back. Repeat it on every enemy. Until the end of the game. It really is repetive and boring. Weapons don't matter much, all of them are good enough for bursting enemy again and again. Grenades aren't given often and flashbang don't seem to be as useful as in multiplayer. Smoke grenade is more offensive there though, making enemies cough instead sometimes. There is little enemy variety as well, you just got whatever hitscan stupid enemy, stationary snipers with laser, whatever melee enemy that rushes you and terrorist with freaking bazooka that is pain to avoid too! So, burst headshot, and burst headshot, repeat repeat repeat.It also finally get to have some music there. For once. So, something definitely good.Counter-Strike Condition Zero is better offer than Counter-Strike 1.6 and has more value for solo players, but it's still not good enough to get me much interested in such twitchy realistical shooter. I still wouldn't recommend new people, especially with newer CS titles out there, only those who already play Counter-Strike should check out this one.			"

												COUNTER STRIKE: CONDITION ZERO Cs 1.6 with graphical improvements and bot mode.GraphicsSame as CS but a few improvements. New player model 1 for each team. Slight improvements to weapons and such. But This is 2004 And Halflife 2 came out about the same time with the source engine. BUT this is on Goldsrc engine for a game that was realeased in 2004. AI: 8/10 Has a ""Campaign"" which is basically matches against bots where you try to complete goals like""Kill 4 enemys""""Rescue 2 Hostages""""use a Flashbang""Makes a nice Practice mode for singleplayer because the original CS didnt come with bots. The enemy AI is quite good if you arent a CS Pro and I had to reapet level quite a few times. Sound: 6/10Slight Improvements but overall the sameGameplay: 8/10Same As the original counter strike but i feel the hitboxes are a bit bigger. Recoil is still there so Spray-and-Pray isnt the way to go.Overall 7/10Decent Game Dont buy it on its own get it with CS:Complete Pack or the original Counter StrikeGame Design 6/10Pretty Good. Improvements across the board. Overall 7/10Only buy this with CS:Complete Set. Or with CS 1.6 Multiplayer is Mostly Dead. COUNTER STRIKE CONDITON ZERO : DELETED SCENESExpansion Pack For CS:CZ With a new campaign thats exactly like your average COD campaign WITH ZERO PLOT. I dont know why they made this because CS:S was almost finished and HL2 was hot stuff.Graphics: 6/10Same As CS:CZ and new enemy player models for the campaign. Not much to say here Sound 5/10Same as CS:CZ but some nice (and awful) music.AI: 4/10TERRIBLE the enemy ai in the campaign basically cycles from Run at you, Shoot you, Run away, RepeatEnemys have no strategy at all and Require no tactics to defeat unlike CS 1.6/CS:CZ. The only thing diffucult is when enemys respawn 2 seconds after you kill them. You dont make a game where enemys respawn after killing them to make up for there diffuculty. Game play 5/10Nothing New.Game Design: 6/10Levels are varied like a stealth mission and such but nothing special. No new weapons. Nothing specialOverall 5/10I dont know why the released this instead of CS:S. "

												Too too bad. I rate this game to 0/10, why? Enemys and Team mates AI=0. Grenades are  useless. Soldiers coming behind your back. The most frustrating thing is your teammates are die all the time because they can't kill just 1 terrorist. Bazooka terrorists going to troll you and you are going to ragequit.

												This game is all about the mission and the offline campaign that was created with it, called the ""Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes"". It was way easier than 1.6, headshots and spray kills happens way easier than in 1.6, and whereas some spam points has been removed in the old maps (and in the added CZ maps), it doesn't really change the layout all that much. It's still the same game - just easier, imo. I don't recommend it, since the campaign is dull and boring, gameplay answers to 1.6, just easier, as previously mentioned, and lastly, the ""Call of Duty"" offline bot campaign is so boring and repetitive, you might want to just beat expert, never to come back. It's that terrible. Buy 1.6 instead if you want the game in it's entirety, because CZ, while Source added some new elements and better graphics, is just a blatant copy with extra features thrown in there, for people who doesn't care.

												dieses Spiel ist eigentlich zimlich gut und man ist schnell überrascht was man damit alles anstellen kann so viele Mods wie ( Star-Wars , Left 4 Dead , Furiens ) und noch viele mehr ich muss auch zugeben manchmal war ich sehr überrascht was das spiel alles zu bieten hat ^^Edit: So schade es auch ist aber dieses Spiel wurde von ""Counter-Strike Global Offensive"" total vernichtet! Damals gab es jegliche Art von Mods und ca. 1.500 Server jetzt nach der Erscheinung von CSGO gibt es ca. 1.000 weniger Server und darunter sind leider die ganzen tollen Mods. Es gibt nur noch die Mods ""Furiens, GunGame, Deathrun, Jailbreak, Surf, Zombie Plage und Base Build"", natürlich wahren diese Mods schon immer dabei, mit dem Unterschied, dass ""Star Wars, Left 4 Dead"" und ein Haufen an Furiens Servern ""down"" sind und damit nicht mehr erreichbar. eine echte Schande, dabei ist CSGO nicht mal ansatzweise besser als Counter-Strike Source, was ich auch gerne kaufen würde, allerdings weiß ich nicht wie stark dieses Spiel getroffen wurde und ob es da überhaupt noch Server gibt... traurig aber war, CounterStrike Conditions Zero wurde von CounterStrike Global Offensive zerstört.

												I played through this game today thinking I would find something I could enjoy because I have enjoyed CS:GO quite a bit. When I first booted it up all I could find where missions that just wanted me to play on the multiplayer against bots. I really dislike playing with the bots because they are not real players and they do very stupid things. I found no appeal in these missions.Then there was the Deleted Scenes. A Single-player campaign that I just couldn't really get into. It was more cheesy than Call of Duty was back when this game released and is even more cheesy than the newer Call of Duty games because of how over the top it is.This game is dull and if you own any other Counter-Strike game there is no reason to get this game.

												Condition Zero comes with 2 modules:1. Condition Zero (CZ) - Provides a slightly different MP experience to that of CS1.6, mostly graphical changes with a few gameplay changes. Also has a player vs. bots singleplayer mode, which is essentially just multiplayer with bots instead of humans, but with added objectives to make it a bit more difficult.2. Deleted Scenes - A scripted single player campaign similar to something you'd see in Quake or Unreal Tournament.For simplicity's sake I'll go over the changes CZ introduces, just keep in mind this isn't something I've thoroughly researched or anything of the sort, just what I know from playing multiple versions of CS for around a decade now. If you don't know the core gameplay of Counter Strike to understand these changes... well then go buy 1.6 and then consider picking up CZ.ChangesLighting - Lighting is updated to be more smooth and natural, shadows and darkness is generally not as harsh and saturation looks much more natural, in my opinion this is a good change both aesthetically and gameplay wise, excluding the saturation change. I would prefer deeper saturation to make things easier to see and more colorful. You can somewhat counteract this by using a setting called digital vibrance in the NVidia control panel. If you have an AMD card they have a similar setting, though I do not know what it is called.Gun Models - Gun models are updated to look more realistic and metallic, most have changed color palettes or just added color in general and a select few have new animation, mostly just moving parts, for instance the bolt on the FAMAS/Clarion now moves when firing. Also the knife has a new animation which I think looks awful. Overall this is a positive change though.Character Models - Character models are completely changed. They are higher resolution but in my opinion the new models look lame in comparison to the 1.6 models.Textures - Pretty much every texture on the maps have been changed and made higher resolution. For the most part the changes are welcome to me, though they do effect the visual feel of the maps a little. I think I'd consider this a positive change.Outside of the additions I mentioned at the beginning of the review, that's really the extent of the changes. Mostly all visual changes.So the question is... do these changes warrant a purchase? Not in the slightest. For various reasons, if you're buying this for multiplayer, you're better off just playing 1.6.In my eyes, the only reason to pick up CZ is for the Deleted Scenes. However I don't believe Deleted Scenes is actually worth the $10 CZ goes for.Basically the campaign is a collection of missions with no overarching story or really anything of interest in the way of plot. They are all linear. They take place in different locales around the world. They are all played on the CT side, although the factions will differ. They offer a very small amount of puzzle solving. They have boss fights. They have forced stealth sections.Here is what I dislike about Deleted Scenes:Linear as hell, wouldn't be a problem if it didn't give you the illusion of choice with multiple hallways and doors just leading to dead ends, often without an item reward.Secrets are hidden pretty lazily and without thought, even when you go out of your way to look for them you probably won't find a majority of them, and when you do find them, they are mostly useless.Enemy placement has very little thought, often times they are placed in dark corners or closed doors. If they are placed somewhere that requires a scripted animation, they are completely invincible until the animation plays out.Boss battles are awful, all of them but the final 2 bosses are insanely easy. The 2nd to last boss is just a bullet sponge that can take literally several AK clips to the head and numerous grenades before he dies, but he can kill you just as quick as any other enemy, not to mention he's surrounded by 2 shot kill snipers AND you are on a timelimit to kill him. Just awful. The last boss is actually pretty good and a satisfying finale, but he also has 2 bullet sponge troops that will kick your♥♥♥♥♥if you don't cheese them somehow.The game is incredibly easy, even on hard. The only time I was challenged was the aforementioned bosses and when I had to escort the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI.Escorting AI is just plain awful.The most fun guns run out of ammo quickly.You can get trapped by AI very easily.Some puzzles are very difficult not because they require you to use your brain but rather because they require you to go around knifing random things (MULTIPLE TIMES) until something breaks, and it's rarely obvious what you should be attacking.Allied AI is uselessEnemy AI is braindead. Most of the time they just stand in one spot and shoot at you, never trying to get to a better position.The forced stealth is AWFUL. It's dreadfully boring and boils down to crouching behind a box, waiting for enemy to turn back, moving to next box, waiting for enemy to turn back, rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat, over and over again and it always left me wanting to just quit playing it was so boring and uninspired. More guns, less sneaking. PLEASE.With that said, I think Deleted Scenes is a fairly average FPS when it's at it's best. When at it's worst it is just plain bad. Unless you're a die hard CS fan that wants to experience it, there are so many other games to spend your time and money on.Oh and I didn't even mention the fact that this came out in 2004. Half Life 2 came out 7 months after this. Take a second to think about that.			"

												Boring... Just boring, since I'm neither a really dedicated CS gamer, nor am I really good at FPS games, maybe I'm not the right to judge.The AI is not really good, and sometimes buggy, some enemies didn't even bother shooting at me, while other just hat lightning reflexes. That doesn't matter, because even on Medium the enemies bullets don't really do any damage. The same applies to your bullets, but since you got about 2 seconds time to aim, you can simply do all headshots, which kinda works.Ammunition is always a problem, which adds some kind of difficulty to the game, since you are forced to engage close combat with sniper rifles and long range combats with shotguns, just keep one mag an a long range weapon and it shouldn't be a problem.The grafics are like Condition Zero grafics, not fancy nowadays, but better than CS1.6 and are well enough.The main reason I dislike this game is the complete lack of any story. There were some minor ""plot"" - like parts, where you are told why to go there and kill all those guys, or sometimes sneek past the guards you could easily overwhelm. Another thing is the sometimes really hard to find routes through the level, some pathways are blocked by a locked door, others by invisible walls, and the worst kind are the pathways, which actually are blocked by some kind of fence, which you are supposed to climb over, but you are never given any hint to do that.All in all it is a training program for CS: Condition Zero and maybe some other counter strike games, but does not really have any motivational aspects for me.

												One of the buggiest games I've ever played. It seems a joke. These are the reasons to not buy this game ever:1. Very repetitive2. Non sense puzzles to solve to make the game last longer: Stupid like a switch does not work until you kill an enemy that is hidden somewhere.3. Everything is scripted: Sometimes there is friendly fire and sometimes not, some enemies can be killed with barrels some not, enemies will teleport infront of you.4. Very poorly scripted: NPC can block your pass to finish a mission so you have to load a previous save to finish a mission. NPC are ridicously exposed so they can be killed and missin fails.5. Very buggy: Sometimes you cant climb a ladder or sometimes you have to load a previous save because something that was supossed to happen didn't happened.6. No realism at all: Things like killing bosses with 5 headshots with an sniper rifle, enemies shooting behind bushes where you cannot see through, enemies shooting you in darkness, etc.7. Really poor difficulty level: I played in hard mode. The first missions were just fine in difficultie but for some reason, the more I played, the more overclocked the enemies are: yes, overclocked. Enemies will run faster, shoot faster and need 3 headshots to be killed. The last mission I played (in japan) was so ridiculous that enemies could kill you in 1ms after you cross a wall, or walk 30 meters in 1 second, just like the first half life ninjas but with bigger guns.8. The saves are broken: I've never seen this in my life. The save files have two major bugs. The first one is that each time you load a save file, your weapon starts firing until you switch weapon. This makes you loose a lot of ammo. The second bug is that when you load a file, you dont appear exactly were you should be and you dont have the same ammo and health. Actually I got stuck in a situation where I was appearing in front an enemy who killed me in 1 millisecond after loading.			"

												One of the worst FPS games I've ever played. Weapons feel terrible and behave very differently compared to the multi-player versions of those exact same weapons. AI is horrible. Visuals are decent for a game running on top of the goldsrc engine but at the same time visuals are not very optimised causing slowdowns now and then. Sounds and music are low quality stuff. Voice acting is ridiculously bad. There are plenty of issues to talk about. But all this is mostly forgivable stuff.Why you might ask? It's because of the mess that is the development history of this game. It was originally conceived in 2000. It was announced in 2001 at E3. However the studio that started the development, Rogue Entertainment, went defunct later that year. The development was then handed over to Gearbox Software but they were not allowed to complete this game after missing out the 2002 deadline. Then the bits and pieces were sticked together in a rush by Ritual Entertainment in 2003 but that work was for naught. It's a miracle that CS:CZ was even released at all. The fourth studio to work with this game, the newly founded Turtle Rock Studios, abandoned the whole single-player campaign to make their own thing. CS:CZ was eventually released in 2004 as a multi-player focused training game with bots.


Precursor to modern military shooters: Player cannot progress before scripted cutscene ends and NPC opens a door in Middle East scenario.

CS:CZ:DS offers a curious peek into the future of what could have been. More refined version of CS:CZ:DS is what the grand single-player Counter-Strike game should have been. Instead we got a campaign about series of matches against bots with challenges in CS:CZ. That's all fine and dandy but that isn't very interesting. What's interesting about CS:CZ:DS is that here we have a game, that's more of a precursor to Call of Duty, and a game that has a lot in common with the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare games, and other ""Modern Military Shooters"" in-general.


What's with the terrorists always attacking Russian nuclear missile facilities? 
A Screenshot of Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes

CS:CZ:DS is a long pipe FPS, that features series of disconnected missions, extremely heavy scripting, NPC interaction similar to the Call of Duty, similarly boring repetitive gunplay, vehicle battles against Hind helicopter, explosions, terrorists launching nukes from old Soviet missile silos, and all the other stuff except the high quality craftsmanship that goes into the Call of Duty games.I bought the game when it was originally released in 2004 and it was pretty bad even then. I just installed CS:CZ to replay it since it was release for Linux in 2013 and I'm mostly spending my time in Linux thesedays. The CS:CZ:DS can be an interesting precursor for the modern military shooters if you're interested in playing that kind of stuff but in-generally people should avoid this game for what it is. It's an unfinished single-player Counter-Strike game that features normal Counter-Strike multi-player mode with slightly updated graphics and bots.

												DELETED SCENES:-Really Repetitive-As stereotypical as it gets-Extremely predictable campaign-Poorly made models (such as not being able to shoot through transparent bits)-Boss fights (yes, boss fights) have ridiculous health. One took like 20 head-shots to kill him (no joke).-No real story, just missions-Recoil is almost like Call Of Duty, all bullets go perfectly straightNORMAL:+Great for beginners-No story, just the same old 1.6Overall, Deleted Scenes is awful. If you are new to Counter-Strike, then the normal Condition Zero would be great for you. However, if you are already play CS, then this game is not for you.Believe me, the campaign from Deleted Scenes is not worth playing at all.			"

												Downvoted only due to the following:The practice of paying for mods is antithetical to the nature of the modding community; an optional ""DONATION"" button is not (Just like on the Nexus http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/? ). Was a fun game, The fact that Valve is doing this and that Bethesda is endorsing it and they both taking the largest share of the modders' work is American Corporate greed at it's finest.Take something artistic and done for the love of the subject matter, monetize it, then allow the accountants to define art as widgets, and then creativity is now run by the mercantile class, the middle men, who are ""America Corporates"".If they had any integrity and decency, any moneys brought in, at the very least, should be 100% donated to charities on behalf off the modding community in conjunction with Valve or Bethesda or whomever. See Gaben, you don't need the cash grab, you can win by getting good press which in the long run would do better for you to show you are not like EA et al.			"

												This recommendation is for Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes.What can I say, other than it's basically Call of Duty made with the GoldSRC engine.It doesn't look good, animations are clunky, it usually takes enemies two or three headshots to die (seriously) and the stealth parts can get really annoying.Even with that, it managed to keep me entertained long enough to actually finish it, but in short bursts. I don't think anyone will find themselves playing this game for more than 40 minutes or so at a time.I give it a 6 / 10 only because I finished it and because FPSs are one of my favourite genres of gaming, but if you're not into FPSs I'm pretty sure you'll give it a lower score.5-word summary:GoldSRC wasn't meant to CoD.

The weapons just feel off, the singleplayer campaign is frustrating.'Condition Zero' is for the hardcore fans, and those prefer a quick online match with CS1.6If you never played Counter-Strike before, go play 'Global Offensive' or 'Source' - or even 1.6, but don't touch 'Condition Zero', for God's sake!

												Counter-Strike: Condition Zero. Where to start? First off,  let me just say that you would be better off getting CSS or CS:GO (CS:GO gets hated on way too much). Now, Condition Zero does not have the best graphics. By that, I mean the graphics are terrible and the animation is equally bad. Condition Zero also has a terrible map. For someone who has never played Counter Strike, it might be fine. But for someone who has—well, let's just say that you would be better off spending your $10 on something else.			"

												This game was a huge flop and I seriously don't know why they even realeased this game since Valve already had Source coming out and the biggest different between 1.6 and CZ was a tiny ""better"" (if you'r even allowed to say so) graphics and a singleplayer mode with missions and AI bots. If you buy the cs-package ""anthology"" I belive you get the cz game with it + 1.6 so in that case you can just try it out for yourself but i doubt it will be any good..			"

												As dated as this game may be, compared to Global Offensive. Condition Zero is a mainly singleplayer focused Counter Strike title oddly enough. Which its the very old unreal style campaign, not the story driven one we now see in a regualr shooter. So; is it as fun as newer Counter Strike titles? Yes, maybe even a bit more. Has it aged well? No. It a very love hate relationship between me and the campaign style here. I like the ai team mate selection gimmick, allowing you to choose better, people to be with assuming you have the right points to buy them before the match begins. The stat's on them which are skill, co-op, and bravery actually matter and can have very noticable effects on how they move around the map. Me, I personally think Travis, the riot shield weilding badass of 300 confirmed kills is someone that is a required team mate. Where as one may go with Pete someone who as balanced stats across the board, but only has a smg. There is actually a pretty good amount of tactical feel to this, as many times I was stuck on a level I could switch out team mates and DESTROY. BUt this campaign style is a little.......... frustrating? In each match there are a certain preset requirements for you to complete. These are the BAIN OF COUNTER STRIKE, as some on the expert difficulty are masochistically made. Kill and enemy with a knife and survive the round? ♥♥♥♥ no. Besides that, I recommend this game. Also shotguns are much better in source.			"

												A suprisingly good game. The game looks extremely dated, and looks like its not worth it, but the game is actually very fun. The game is basically counter-strike, execpt with a single player ""Tour of Duty"", or actual somewhat campaign in deleted scenes' case. Cause the review is taking me to Condition Zero, the regular version, even though I wanted to just talk about the Deleted Scenes, I will talk about both. So yeah, the big thing about this game is that you have a single player mode. The version in the regular version is a ""Tour of Duty"", which is just doing the bomb or hostage games with bots on both sides, with a few missions you have to complete before the game ends. While this just sounds like something that should have been a update for regular Couter-Strike, it actually throws in some great ideas. Like being able to select who you want to be on your team. Each character takes up a certain amount of points, meaning you cant select them all willy nilly, and they come with individual stats and weapons. These stats include, bravery (how willing they are to fight), skill (how well they are at aiming), and coop (the chance that they will listen to your commands). Thats another cool mechanic, you can talk to your teammates with the voice command buttons, and they will listen...sometimes. They also have free will so that they can ethier say ""No"" because they can't, or because they don't want to, making sure that you choose your teammates wisely. In Deleted Scenes, instead of ""Tour of Duty"", you instead have various situations that have cutscenes, listed objectives that change as you go, and only certain weapons for each situations. This adds alot more variety to the game, and makes playing each individual missions worth it. And thats really it for the games. I can't review the multiplayer since I can't find a server. I say that if ya have some left over money and need something to do, buy these games, if ya can only buy one, get Deleted scenes.Review Score:Condition Zero-7.5/10Deleted Scene-8.5/10			"

												Hi people, I just thougth I'd write a recommendation for this epic early 2000 game. So you play as different factions from the original Counter-Strike from 1998 but with updated graphics and infact new models. The game has AI that attempts to look at you making you think that the AI likes you.. Then they run at you with a machete, and don't forget how you are ALWAYS alone even though you saw 5 swat guys behind you  1 min ago. So, this game in a nutshell: Lone wolf, cool, time killer and something you  can play without stopping. It's not like you get stuck in Sierras obvious traps and puzzles. I also recommend you to YouTube it, because a video is always better than words! (♥♥♥♥ you) have an awesome friggin day.. (that was for me) enjoy DS.			"

												I recommend it because condition zero contains 2 different games in one pack1) condition zero is counter strike in its classic formula with ""single player missions"" using bots (I find it funny to play)2)""condition zero deleted scenes""  expansion pack contains a lot of single player missions with a story and original maps...it's like an action movie. If you like Call Of Duty games, I thinks that this expansion pack is similar to it in gameplay, but it's honestly is better than CoD.so you have 2 good single player games in 1			"

												Counter-Strike: Condition Zero. Pretty awesome single player ""Tour of Duty"" style gameplay. Brings the standard CT Vs. T gameplay into the scene with missions with and against BOTs that also judges your selection of teammates. Not choosing the right ones can cost you a mission, easily.Counter-Strike: Condition Zero deleted scenes. First person campaign of the counter-strike series. Uhhh...yes please? Pretty awesome game overall. Incorporates the gameplay of CS with a single-player FPS story. Can't ask for much more...well except maybe if it had the graphics and engine of Source/Global Offensive instead of Condition Zero...lol. "

												Counter-Strike is a first-person shooter in which players join either the terrorist team, the counter-terrorist team, or become spectators. Each team attempts to complete their mission objective and/or eliminate the opposing team. Each round starts with the two teams spawning simultaneously.A player can choose to play as one of eight different default character models (four for each side, although Counter-Strike: Condition Zero added two extra models, bringing the total to ten). Players are generally given a few seconds before the round begins (known as ""freeze time"") to prepare and buy equipment, during which they cannot attack or move (one notable exception is that a player may receive damage during freeze time. This happens when a map is changed to spawn players at a certain height above the ground, thus causing fall damage to the player. This is a method map designers use to alter the starting ""HP"" of players on a map). They can return to the buy area within a set amount of time to buy more equipment (some custom maps included neutral ""buy zones"" that could be used by both teams). Once the round has ended, surviving players retain their equipment for use in the next round; players who were killed begin the next round with the basic default starting equipment.			"

												The leading Counter Strike game when compared to CS:CZ and Counter Strike. This game has a proper storyline which is absent from all other counter strike games, even CS:GO. The storyline is realistic, immersive and diversifed in the world of espionage and counter terrorism across all nations and offers a non-biased perspective of terrorism: that terrorism has no race, nationality or religion and shows the the world can be united against extremism across all fronts: from Lithuania to Russia and from the Middle East to the USA and the Philippines. The player is exposed to hostage, IED, sieges and other crisises in bank robberies, to sieges of nuclear and oil production facilities all over the world, in some cases functioning as a mirror image of actual crisises that occured for instance the US bank heist and the Philippines German hostage crisis following the plane terrorist incident and the embassy crisis in Teheran, Iran. The game was noticably founded on the tenets of the aforementioned and was shaped into a realistic, acceptable storyline given events worldwide at the time aided the understanding of the storyline as well, enhancing the cognitive ability to accept the storyline exposed to the player. This game is one of the few games that capitalises on the aforementioned. If it wern't for the graphics, this game would still be played as much as Insurgency or CS:GO today, by projection. Despite the Half Life engine leading to constraints on aesthetics due to the limitations of the physics laws in half life, it is still a must play. It's an eye opener to the world of terrorism and extremism still revelant today as it encompasses incidents from the 90s to the 2000s.			"

Now condition zero (not deleted scenes) i liked it to but... its just playing with bots... there isnt much to it i think i would give it a 6/10 tbh			"

												Counter-Strike: Condition Zero. Pretty awesome single player ""Tour of Duty"" style gameplay. Brings the standard CT Vs. T gameplay into the scene with missions with and against BOTs that also judges your selection of teammates. Not choosing the right ones can cost you a mission, easily.Counter-Strike: Condition Zero deleted scenes. First person campaign of the counter-strike series. Uhhh...yes please? Pretty awesome game overall. Incorporates the gameplay of CS with a single-player FPS story. Can't ask for much more...well except maybe if it had the graphics and engine of Source/Global Offensive instead of Condition Zero...lol. "

												As a fan of classic shooters this game is Counter Strike with a story and a better overrall hit detection from the original game (I know some people are used to it but I am not). Play this game. It came late in the development of the counter strikes and only a few months before Source which seems like a major reason to simply not play this game because of the fact. I liked this game and got a couple good fun hours out of it. Thanks.8/10 - It was worth it and definitely better than just Condition Zero			"

												Regarding CS CZ DELETED SCENES. A very solid mod. Offers great missions, voices and sounds are great. Mission crossover with normal CS maps. Realistic accuracy and gun control, not the reatrded♥♥♥♥♥♥show from normal CS where it feelsl like everyone is shooting drunk. Challenging gameplay with good mechanics and a few new things added. Highly recomend to any halflife player, aspecially to CS players to get the feel how CS really should have been.Finally after the beating the stock campaign matches on all difficulties and having played some online, the game is fairly simple and similar to original CS, just more polished. Good game overall, but not for my taste. Luck in this game has a bigger role than skill, and a game mechanic like that is unappealing to selfaware FPS gamer. I can beat UT2004 on Godlike, yet this is almost impossible for me. A good game, but not my game.			"

												Ah, Condition Zero. The red-headed stepchild of the Counter-Strike world.Pity that, it's a really good game.   Since I have a damaged computer at the moment, with limited 3d accel.  I can'trun Source-engine games.   This one uses the original Half-Life/Counter-Strike mod's Goldsrc.This version is a bit nicer than CS 1.6, and is quite a bit more polished.   There is some activity on the servers, if you're into multiplayer.  The maps are quite nice-looking for a old quake-engine game.  The included versions of Cobblestone and Aztec look great are a blast to play.I got it as part of a bundle, and it's been one of the best buys I've made on Steam.   Absolutely recommend.(don't get me wrong, CS:GO is great, but don't pass this one up because it's old).   For n00bs, its a great intro to theCS world.			"

												This is sadly very underrated for a counter strike game. It deserves so much more attention! Not only do you get the tour of duty and multiplayer, you also get a set of disconnected deleted singleplayer levels that are AMAZING to play. these levels are like COD campaign missons except they aren't too over the top. This game is ALOT of fun. I love it for it's gameplay and items, (especially the tactical shield, i LOVE the tactical shield) And overall depth. I could not reccomend it more			"

												This is a unique twist on the Counter-Strike formula. Instead of focusing on multiplayer, this game is based on single player gameplay. You must fight in multiple locations, hire other Counter Terrorists with reputation, and complete missions in the middle of the game. Think of operation missions in Counter-Strike Global Offensive, but ones that can be completed in one match. I for one enjoy this different style of gameplay.			"
