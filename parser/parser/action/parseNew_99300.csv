												TL;DR: Proceed to summary.Gameplay:I would describe this game as an arcady shoot'em up.In a top-downish view you control a vehicle freely in a set area and shoot the hell out of your enemies while crashing through buildings. You obtain objectives to progress and occasionally sidequests. If you take too long, ignoring the main objective, the game starts a 3 minutes countdown. No need to become desperate as in my experience no mission takes more than 2 minutes.Killed enemies may drop pick-ups. Those are health / big health / machine gun upgrade (maxed with 2nd pick-up) / secondary weapon: railgun (my prefered), rocket launcher, flame thrower / ammo for secondary weapons / key cards (mission related). Pick-ups grant bonus points if your health/ammo is full, your machine gun is maxed or you already possess the same secondary weapon.Harder foes are introduced through progress in the campaign. You need different approaches to beat them. It ranges from kill before they fire to circling around them. It also depends on which character you have chosen as the special abilities differ much.If you die you lose any picked up upgrade. If not ending up on the wheels, the game resets your car and you won't lose anything. If you get stuck somewhere or sink in water, you will respawn, again without loss. The game has no checkpoints. Losing the last life requires to rebegin that level, nonetheless any earned XP gets accounted.There are 9 levels and 5 different characters/vehicles you may choose from (excluding DLC, see below). Every car has another special ability which can change the playstyle a lot. Points you earn while playing are also accounted as XP towards your chosen character. By leveling up you earn upgrade points and unlock additional perk slots. You can use those points to unlock perks from 3 single-pathed skill trees: Offensive, Defensive, Tactic. Off and Def are the same for all, only their order varies. Tactic perks boost your special ability. Reaching max level every perk is unlocked.Difficulty settings:Casual: Infinite lives, reduced score, no leveling, no upgrades, no damage streaks.Normal: 5 lives.Hardcore: 3 lives, increased score.(Side note: I only played on hardcore.)It took me the first 2-3 levels to get used to the game and achieving consistently good results. It still was a challenge though. The final level is a bit tedious because it is a very long path featuring many challenges (even a few jump&run elements) until you reach the final boss.Controls:You can view them in the main menu and while pausing the game. Unfortunately you can't remap them. Even though the game recommends a controller, I had no problems playing on keyboard & mouse. You move around with [W], [A], [S], [D]. Press [SHIFT] to drive faster in return you won't be able to fire. [CTRL] activates the handbrake so that your car won't roll by itself (down a ramp). Use [SPACE] for the special ability and [E] to switch secondary weapon (giving up the current one). Tap [TAB] to show a semi-hollow map which will be displayed in the center of your screen. It shows the locations of your current mission.The mouse is used to move a reticle on your screen. It marks the spot you will shoot at. [Left Mouse Button] fires machineguns. [Right Mouse Button] fires secondary weapon. If you target something above (e.g. helicopter) or below (e.g. down a ramp) you, the game adapts automatically.The default movement emulates a d-pad, giving 8 possible directions. I recommend to enable ""Tank Steering"" as it allows you to move freely. [W] being forwards, [S] backwards, [A] for steering left, [D] steering right. Keep in mind that ""Tank Steering"" won't apply to the helicopter which is no problem as you won't encounter many obstacles in the air.Story:The story is straightforward and foreseeable, nontheless it's good enough to attract your attention and wanting you to learn more. As the store page already states, the main plot line is ""In Renegade Ops you must defeat Inferno, a madman intent on global domination."" The characters you can choose from are part of the Renegades which are under general Bryant's command. They fight Inferno, his minions and maybe even more... The cutscenes are presented in comic style. When the story/mission goes on while playing the game displays a single panel at the top right, not disturbing your view. Subtitles are fit in the pictures and don't break the comic art style.Graphics:Available settings are resolutions, anti-aliasing (none, x2, x4) and v-sync (none, 60).The game ran smooth on my machine and I never encountered lag or drops in framerate.Settings: 1920x1080, AAx4, no v-sync.Specs: Intel Core i7-4702MQ 2.2GHz, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 850M, 8 GB DDR3.The game is nice to look at while cruising through the well designed areas. The levels vary and you will encounter different environments and textures. Water and most important fire effects are an eyecandy. The explosions are a blast and even though most entities are quite small, they are detailed.Sound:You won't really pay attention at the music except for the intro/menu/cutscenes as your concentration focuses on the action and the sound effects will predominate. As far as I was able to listen to it, it fitted well. Outside of fights it keeps subtle and turns more intense while fighting, adding the feeling of action. As everything is about firing and explosions the sound effects are a blast. The audio never annoyed me in except for one thing: Driving at max speed keeps looping the sound of the car, including shifting etc.Multiplayer:You won't find someone randomly. You need to organise sessions with Steam friends.The leaderboards are occupied by cheaters (as almost everywhere). It seems that no dev cares about.Replayability:Each car needs a different playstyle and you might want to experience all of them, especially if you plan to reach max level with all. Additionally a few achievements aren't story/progress related. Finally there is the multiplayer mode when you have someone to play with.Bugs & other issues:My game crashed 3 times in total while playing. I encountered the infamous ""AVA_Main has stopped working"" error. In my case ut popped up randomly. I was able to complete the game and its achievements.The special ability bar is located at the bottom left of your screen, way out of your focus. You will be hit if you want to check it.DLCs:Coldstrike Campaign:The story continues and puts you in snowy, icy regions. It offers 3 levels, the last one being the most difficult. That final level features (again) a long road until you reach the boss. At 2 different spots you could call it unfair or cheap. 4 new achievements, 3 for completing the levels, 1 for easter egg.Reinforcement Pack:Features 2 new renegades/characters/vehicles.Summary:+Gameplay fun & enjoyable+Casual-friendly difficulty with infinite lives+Challenging & fair hardcore difficulty+Accessible keyboard & mouse controls+Story attracts attention+Smooth graphics, little eye candy+Fitting sounds are literally (a) blast/s.+Replayability through levels, different cars & achievements+Featuring Gordon Freeman, HL3 confirmed!-Superficial & straightforward story-Multiplayer is dead (friends needed)-Leaderboards aren't cleansed from cheaters-""AVA_Main has stopped working"" error-Car sound shifting infinitelyGood game.16,99€ (Bundle with DLCs) is a good price.7/10			"

												Remember when you were a kid, you'd drag out all of your G.I. Joe's, set them up all over the living room, get out all the vehicles, man them up and get them set just right.  Then, your dad would walk in, step on Junkyard in his bare feet, swear at 'all these god damn toys!' then mumble as he kicked the Viper copter under the coffee table and kicking over the hovercraft as exited down the hall. Then you'd set everything back up, just as it was before and you were READY.  The mission was READY.  You had to infiltrate Cobra, take out the Cobra Commander, convince The Baroness to come home with you and be your girlfriend since you were being such a badass Joe, all while you were slamming your VAMP Jeep through the gears, manuevering like Michael Knight through the chaos and onslaught of Cobra's defense! Your machine gun lit up the living room as it chewed up land scape, vehicles and Cobra Casulties left and right, leaving nothing but smoking ruins in it's wake! That's what Renegade Ops is like.  You drive a badass Jeep, you shoot♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥blows up.  You are a bonafide badass.  It looks fantastic too, with big bright and beautiul explosions, driving through buildings just to see them collapse and blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up, even if it doesn't give you points.  Too bad the Baroness isn't in this, cause she'd totally be woo'd into being your girlfriend after you got done being such kick♥♥♥♥♥Joe. GO JOE!Er...uh...WOLVER----GADES!  RENEGADES!			"

												Renegade Ops runs on a philosophy of being badass above all else! It marries the movement and speed of an isometric racing game with the endless explosions of a twinstick shooter, firmly aware of its shallowness and playing it up to great effect. The over the top story of a team of ex-military personnel gone rogue when the government couldn't make the call to action is outrageous and thoroughly entertaining, existing as a conduit for one liners and to shuffle around a bunch of musclebound dudes and gals (major kudos for having as many awesome female characters as bros, and letting them keep their clothes on to boot) with the sole intention of blowing up anything everything in their path.With how much is going on at any given time, be it the constant barrage of bullets, endless explosions, crumbling buildings and who knows what else, it's so overwhelmingly bombastic and fun that it's easy to overlook how repetitive the levels and enemies become by the end. This definitely has a lot to do with the fantastic coop, as although blowing crap up solo is all well and good, it's nothing like the raw insanity of grabbing a friend or two along for the ride. Sure, I might have seen that texture a good several hundred times already, and I swear I already blew that tank up, but there's no time to think about that because they're back again and I'm not nearly sick of watching them go boom yet!The only thing standing in the way of you and some friends wreaking all sorts of mayhem is the obtrusive and entirely unnecessary life system, which gives you a finite number of lives to complete a mission and should you die you're out for good. I get that the developer was going for an arcade feel, but there was never an instance when this restriction ever added to the game, only ever serving as an disheartening moment of realization as my coop partner got knocked out for the rest of the mission and was left to watch from the sidelines as I attempted to clean things up. Renegade Ops is at its core a pretty dumb game, and it knows this, but it's also an extremely enjoyable sort of stupidity that only ever asks that you come along for the ride, switch your mind off and hold down the trigger. That might have gotten grating after a few more hours, but the time I spent with Renegade Ops was nothing if not a continual series of ridiculous action movie moments that didn't care about being smart because it was having as much fun with itself as I was.

 Top down game Like no other.I would say that renegades ops is one of those games that come once in a very long while and go unoticed, I remember purchasing it with a bundle with other games and never played it, until one day I was really bored and starting checking the games that I havn`t played, and so I clicked on it and was .......... pretty impressed!.with it`s cartoonish simple catchy story line to the amount of details and physics in the cars and combat, everything is well done and goes along together well.✪ graphics:- well the game look good, and decent, using direct x10 technologies, the vechicles and enviorment are very detailed and the shooting and exploding effect are great, there is nothing to complaint about, any low to mid range gaming pc would be able to handle the game with no hassle. ✪ gameplay:- now here is where a game like this shines, the game suppports 60fps and resolutions up to or even higher than 1440p, the mechanics of the game are smooth and natural, driving the car around is pleasant and doesn`t feel weird, the gameplay is fast paced and keeps you on your toes, so u have to keep moving and shooting no matter what car you are driving. overall your gonna be addicted to it for a while especially if you playing with someone else. ( get to theat in a min)✪ storyline and progress:- I won`t spoil for you guys so I am just gonna say that the story is catchy and kinda fun to follow, your the hero fighting the bad guy straigh forward.you get 5 charecters to choose from, each with a different car, it`s all about the cars not the one driving them so each car has a special ability to use, so no matter what you choose you are always left with strengths and weaknesses.you have upgrades you can buy with points you earn along the game, upgrades slots are divided to 4 with each slot is dedicated to a certain strength, one of those slot is your special power, which is you want to keep upgrading to get powerful. and trust me you will have to finish the game more than once to fully upgrade your charecters. ✪ multiplayer :- now here is the fun part, this game has full controller support and also keyboard and mouse support, in both you u get to play really easily, but if you have 2 controllers then you can play locally, there is something called dynamic camera view (I think ) which means that if you and your buddy are playing locally with your pc 2 controllers, if you both of your cars are close to each other like in the same area then you both get to be in the same screen blazing, but if you buddy decided to wonder off and go do a side mission then the screen splits but not the typical way but it splits dynamically depending on where your friend is, this way you will always know his direction and can randevo easily. this is for the local multiplayer you can also play online with up to 4 player which is really fun cuz it`s bug free and it has neat features such as comparing your score and spliting each groud to go do a mission so its great. ✪ value $$$ :- currently the game retails for 15$ and 30$ if you buy the 4 pack, I would say the 4 pack is a very good value since the game is more fun playing with others online but for 15$ I would say it`s priced reasonably and good, so you won`t be ripped off either way, if you feel this price is high then watch for bundles or game discounts since this game go into discount but not so often. - so what I like about this game:- ✔ no learning curve, easy to play and master.✔ nice graphics, light on your rig. ✔ highly replayablilty.✔ realistic physics and effects. ✔ awesome mutliplayer features, local or online.✔ full controller support or mouse and keyboard. what I don`t like about this game.✘ cannot use keyboard and mouse in local multiplayer, only 2 controllers.✘ the game should have featured more missions✘ does not support windows xp, only supports direct x10I would highly recommend this game for anyone who is looking for a top down game that is well implented and fun, there are even a DLC that expand the campaign and adds 2 more charecters it`s worth looking at but the campaign extension is very short.

												Renegade Ops is a unique piece, a truly rare gem.Initially, skepticism is justified, because controlling a car and shoot requires exceptional maneuverability, but that's the beauty of the game: everything is blended to perfection. For the type of game, the physics of the vehicle is made very well and besides shoot must be careful to ""drive"" as well as possible in order to best avoid the enemy's shots.Everything is rich in details, the attention to detail is obsessive and makes the game a delight for the eyes, especially if carried at maximum graphics options and full-hd.But what makes the game great is the wonderful experience to play online in 4 co-op. You must try, because it is just great!Recommended for sessions on the hard difficulty setting.I really appreciated the character of Gordon (Half Life 2) and his antlions tricks.To note that, unfortunately, the game does not have achievements for online play.I would absolutely recommend it to everyone, because it really deserves to be in your library. Can give you many hours of fun! :))8/10 "

												Renegade Ops; A name that explains itself and explains the game at the same time, an underrated little masterpiece that’s jam-packed full of chaos, anarchy, weapons of mass destruction and all in the form of cars and trucks.To call this old-school or retro would do it something of disservice, it’s essentially more original than that. Renegade Ops takes the old classic, then moves them to a modern level with co-op, persistent character and tremendous graphics. The camera angle is familiar with a style of zooming around a large map in a distinctive style to Desert Strike, but a little more intense.The campaign has an interesting climax to it with a dry sense of clichéd humour and cheesy one-liners as you complete primary and secondary objectives. As you play, it is liberating and anger relieving to blow-up tanks and cars, run yourself through building, and turn infantry units into road-kill. Renegade Ops offers various ways of controlling your car through a game-pad or keyboard, whatever suits your style of gaming. Overall, it’s a great example of a really enjoyable game based on a simple idea that is executed with care and attention to detail. Altogether, a great single player and co-op game you can play with your friends.			"

												Range Rover. Check. Mounted .50 cal machine gun. Check. Even bigger gun ready to spring out of the boot. Check. Driver's name is Gunnar. Check. Why hello there ""Expendables, the game."" , how are you today? No, I'm not confusing the games here, this is the game that the Expendables license should have been slapped on, it has everything you could possibly want. Big over the top villains, a thoroughly ludicrous story, a main protagonist so masculine that you will feel testosterone seep out of the monitor, and a crew who either should be skydiving, in jail, or both.The game runs incredibly smoothly, even when there's a lot going on, and there's enough graphical whizzbangery combined with the over the top explosions (yes, everything blows up, and blows up spectacularly) that you'll feel like you just took a seat in a movie theater to be greeted by Sylvester Stalone and Jason Statham fistbumping. The music is nondescript, it serves mostly as a backdrop for the constant sound of your guns going DAKKA-DAKKA-DAKKA. The story is paper thin, but let's be honest, if you're considering this game, it won't be for the plot.What's on offer here is straightforward, to the point, and does what it sets out to do with aplomb. It's entirely brainless and a great way to kill an afternoon.			"

												Most of the learning curve here is adapting to the vehicles. The vehicles handle like old school NES Nitro Offroad, the game plays like an old fashioned shoot em up, and the graphics are reminiscent of Command and Conquer. This is one of the few games in my library where I get random crashes. The first campaign may hit you like a prize fighter until you've conquered steering, but once you've got it this is a great game.			"

												Firstly, the context of my experience with this game. I bought the four pack for myself and some friends. My first playthrough was with one buddy and we played through all nine missions over two nights on the medium difficulty without much trouble. Next we will do the hardest difficulty and we will try the DLC which we immediately bought after our first playthrough. Eventually I will get two more friends on for this game and probably play through on solo as well.Secondly, the positives. This game is simple fun. The basics of the game are: an arrow points towards your mission objective, you follow the direction the arrow is pointing and blow ♥♥♥♥ up along the way. The mechanics of the game make it easy to play so you can enjoy the action and focusing on not getting killed.The story and cutscenes are hilarious and enjoyable. Never once did I find myself saying, ""Oh no another cutscene."" Infact it was the opposite. I truly enjoyed every single one. Bryant is a badass. The ending to this game is, in one word, AMAZING. Best ending ever? Probably.Thirdly, some comments in general. At first I had some issues with the controls. The default controls are set up such that W moves you towards the top of the screen, S towards the bottom, A to the left, and D to the right. This is really counter intuitive. Luckily there is an easy way to change this. Simply turn on tank steering in the options. Once that option is enabled W moves you forward, S backwards, A turns to the left, and D turns to the right.Some have criticized the mission timers that appear occasionally when you are playing. I am unsure why they find these unenjoyable. Firstly, through my entire first play through I think I saw a timer maybe 6 times. This game isn't about exploration. It is about fast-paced action. You get more points for doing more damage in a short period of time. You always want to be moving forwards to the next objective. Not to mention the fact that the timer isn't arbitrary. It is usually tied directly to a mission objective. IE Destroy the tanks before they reach the town. The timer was never a challenge for me, it was more of a reminder to get the primary mission done.Finally, the negatives. I found the game quite easy. Dying wasn't really a punishment as you just respawn a short distance from where you died and lose some of your power ups which you can quickly reclaim. During my entire first playthrough I did not get a game over once and did not struggle at all to do things within the time limit. The game being easy had the benefit of allowing me to just enjoy the action and story of the game. In short it was a nice casual playthrough. I hope the hardest difficulty puts up a good fight.Also, I would say the game is too short. I am not saying the game is not worth the money, far from it. I got my moneys worth out of this game. I just wish there was more. I wish there was more DLC and more missions. I wish this game wasn't over so fast. I wish there was more story and more Bryant. I would follow that guy into hell and back.So that is my review of the game. I hope you find this helpful.TL:DR;Fast-paced arcade style blow ♥♥♥♥ up game+ Awesome Story, Great Action, Great Gameplay- Too Easy? ShortTurn on Tank Steering if you plan to play with keyboard.			"

												I'm a big fan of most top-down, twin stick shooters to begin with, but Renegade Ops is one of the better ones regardless. The story and atmosphere is like a big slice of 1980s GI Joe with over the top villains, technobabble weaponry and lots of explosions. The gameplay is typical of the sub-genre, cut your way through waves of smaller enemies, grab power-ups, level up, and fight the big bosses. A sizable character upgrade system and high score leaderboards are icing on the cake. Old school bliss.			"

												Blow stuff up and have fun doing it, that pretty much sums up this game.Renegade Ops is a polished twin stick shooter which is just very fun to play. You can level up your characters (each having a unique car and ability) and unlock upgrades with the point earned.  My only minor problem with this game is that for some reason a countdown timer randomly appears having you rush past enemies to get to the objective... which usually for me ends up getting me killed and loosing all my field upgrades and it stops you from doing what is fun, taking your time to destroy everything! + Explosions! + Destruction!+ Having a good time!+ Local Co-op - Count down timer- You have not bought it yet			"

												Awesome game! Bring chaos and destruction everywhere! Very fun to complete it with a friend. In 4-player co-op it's a little bit chaotic. And it's a pity the game is so short. 9 missions default, and 3 DLC. The game isn't ping depended, you can play with people from other part of the world just fine. Plays good on PC without controller but you need some time to get used to controls.Some excerpts of a DLC mission:

												This game is neither good nor bad. It's definitely in between. I would recommend doing some homework before you consider buying it (especially at full price). If I were younger (pre-teens to teens) I would most likely be all over this game. The redundancy of simply running here, getting civilians then blowing this up can really turn a gamer off. Some gamers however, do like games where you simply make things go boom. The gameplay is actually quite decent and may pull some players in. I know the local co-op will definitely raise a few eyebrows.The game follows a top-down format in which you drive a car. The gameplay overall isn't that bad. The left stick drives the car while the right stick shoots (shooting in the direction you are pointing). Different cars have differing abilities. Gordon Freeman (from Half-Life) is a feature character on the steam version and his ability is to dispatch 3 headcrabs which attack enemies. Roxy has the ability to deploy airstrikes which is quite effective. Armand has the ability to use shields (yay how exciting to play defense). Diz is able to literally shut down enemies with her EMP ability. Gunnar has the ability to use a heavy cannon that deals a good amount of damage (however he cannot move while using this ability). Gunnar is pretty cool but so far Roxy and Gordon and the most fun to play with (in my opinion of course)! On top of having these abilities, players are able to boost with A. This is a nice addition as going from one side of the map to another to pick up civilians or to make a time limit can be tough without this ability. The game likes to deploy weapon drops that add an additional weapon to your arsenal. Some of these weapons include a flame thrower or a limited amount of rockets that deal a decent amount of damage.In addition to basic abilities given to characters, there is an RPG element to the game. Players can choose from three categories to upgrade their specific character : defense, offense and tactical. Each character has slightly different upgrades. In general, defense deals with upgrades such as spare parts (that spawn health pickups when your hit) or doubling up on nitro for a quick get away. In general for offense, some upgrades include starting off with consumable weapons (such as rockets or rail guns), auto-reload or ammo surplus. In general for tactical, cool-downs for specials can be reduced, things like ram-plates can be added as well as counter-shots. You need to cause some mayhem to get some ability points!Missions generally consist of either defending or attacking certain targets while attempting to extract civilians. It's almost impossible to go off course unless they give you a secret path to follow. Some missions will have you get into a helicopter and start attacking from the air. I think it's really cool that the game attempted to mix things up a bit and give the player a different sense of control. The problem here for me is some of this becomes redundant and is a complete deterrence for my friends and I to continue playing. I'm glad they at least added the ability to drive into houses and knock them down. Adds a little more to the atmosphere.The visuals are pretty decent. Nothing less than ordinary or extra-ordinary. The helicopter graphics I feel could have been a lot better. The sounds are decent as well and do not go over and above. The dialogue is okay but can get corny at times.Overall, it's not a bad game. I have tolerance for a lot of games but most friends I have played local with neither dislike or like the game. More dislike than like the game. I will recommend it but with a big ""BEWARE"" sign.RATING : 6.75/10Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign B- Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music B- Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ScreenShots : What a boss can look like Using an air strike Another special being used You can get some air in this game "

Fun and polished vehicular twin-stick shooter that feels like a GI Joe episodeThis was made by Avalanche Studios, the same guys who made Just Cause 2 & 3, and it shows in how pretty the game is and also how explodey.Renegade Ops is a top down vehicular shooter. You select from a roster of characters - each with their own vehicle and ultimate ability and skill tree - and set out on. The cheesy action campaign feels like a GI Joe episode: simplistic plot, ""action hero"" good guys, megalomaniacal villain, lots of shootybangs and tacky narration and comic book panels. It's pretty great.Gameplay-wise, you are a zippy vehicle with a gun turret on top that you can rotate in any direction. You can choose ""tank mode"" controls or not for how your vehicle handles. Your turret has your machine gun - unlimited ammo and upgradeable power - and your switcheable special weapon (flamethrower, missiles etc) that runs out of ammo. And you get an ultimate ability on cooldown - some defensive, some versatile, some just destructive - depending on your selected character.I played the main campaign and the DLC. Each campaign is made up of lots and lots of missions, and each mission is pretty long. Thankfully you can ""chapter select"" those you've played, and there's plenty of checkpoints inside each mission.You can play in co-op in a group of up to… four people? I'm not sure, because I've never been able to connect properly. I don't know if it's my router settings or what. Other players seem to connect normally. I imagine the game would be quite fun with other people.			"

												By far one of the best dual stick shooters of all time. This game has it all, over the top story that doesn't take itself too seriously (won't go into detail), arcade style gameplay with modernized mechanics, a cast of seven characters (including Gordon Freeman!), a simple to understand yet challenging scoring system, leaderboards, three difficulty modes (casual, normal, hardcore - I'll touch on this soon), splitscreen co-op, and online multiplayer. The maps in this game are huge and consist of many different environments and they are filled with a variety of enemies, structures, bosses, scripted events, and firepower upgrades/side weapons (who doesn't love upgrades?). Also, there is a leveling system. Each character drives a different vehicle which not only has unique abilities (which you can upgrade before a mission with points earned by leveling up), but handles differently as well. From APCs that feel heavy to nimble buggies.I have to mention that this game is simple to get into but hard to master. Some people criticise the controls in regards to the way the physics work, but aside from some rare issues (in which you can get stuck) the controls are just right, and the physics are there for a reason! They are indeed there to hinder you and give you the feel that you're a reckless renegade speeding in a hunk of metal, but you CAN master the controls! The real issue here is somewhat of a steep learning curve. I find that the real game is hidden underneath the hardcore difficulty. That's when you start feeling like a renegade, it's just you (and up to three friends if playing multiplayer) versus a madman and his seemingly endless army - what are the odds? You'll have to tighten up your manouvering and your aim, and memorize stages in order to succeed. This is when the scoring also feels most rewarding. The negatives for this game consist in more or less minor things such as: not being able to skip in-game cutsceenes, certain points of the map in which you can get stuck (these are rare occurances), and crashes (most notably the ava_main crash which I find infuriating because it effectively ruins the game).In any case I needen't go in more detail, check this game out if you're into top-down, twin stick shooters.

												A very fun little game. Very very much worth more than the £2 I paid for it in the sale. I used the 360 controller - it's designed for it (think I remember seeing it as an XBLA game on the 360) and it shows. A good joypad is pretty much a necessity. Initially, it can be kinda frustrating, but stick with it and you get to the stage of being able to concentrate on two things -moving the vehicle around and firing at something else while somehow watching both at the same time- and it feels very natural.

												Pretty fun action packed twin-stick shooter game! I really enjoy shooting heavy machine guns, rockets and even flamethrower from armored off road vehicle or even a helicopter! The game art style and comic book dialog to it is just amazing! Not a bad top-down arcade lookin' shooter game. Only thing is using keyboard and mouse at first is confusing, but when switching over to gamepad, or 360 control, for me it worked out fine! Well the game even says best to play on gamepad rather than keyboard. Which I think works for this kinda game type. Get it while its on sale!			"

Cortez' voice from TimeSplitters).The gameplay is addictive, and the destruction pleasing and satisfying.The game is quite challenging, and the multiplayer is a hit.And the DLCs are far from being useless or boring.I recomend this game for arcade lovers, hardcore gamers, casual gamers, and shooter lovers.

 Renegade Ops  This is a great game to play. In this production we play as Drivers commandos and our goal is to stop the evil organization Inferno. The game offers cooperation to 2 people on a split screen or singleplayer game. This production has a very nice graphic design and good sound system. Controlling vehicles is very well done and there is a lot of cars to choose from. I think it's pretty cool title and I had a lot of fun playing it. Production which is certainly worth a try.  "

												There need to be more games like Renegade Ops.One of my personal favorites growing up was Jackal on my NES.  Something about that top down view controlling a jeep, resucing soldiers, and blowing up everything a crazed madman could throw at you was just perfect for 10 year old me.  I even rented the game 5+ times from the local video store until I saw it for $7 in a pawnshop and had my tiny mind blown that so much awesome could be had for a few weeks worth of lawn mowing money.I like to think of Renegade Ops as the spiritual successor to Jackal.  The visuals are beautiful, and the way that bad guys explode is top notch.  I don't have a beefy PC by any means, but no matter the number of explosions and guys on my screen, the game never seemed to slow down and allowed the chaos to continue unabated.  In my opinion, the default controls using an xBox 360 controller are darn near perfect.  My one gripe with the game is sometimes I seemed to get stuck in a corner for a bit, but that happened only a handful of times and I was always able to wriggle out.The story is basically a mid-80s action movie and very over the top.  But, it is over the top in a way that works and has a very solid action comic-book feel.  Play this game!  Better yet, get some buddies and play co-op!			"

												Renegade Ops is one of those fun, challenging, enjoyable isometric games to play that make you wonder why there are not more games such as this one.  In essence, there is, but Renegade Ops does everything right in this genre that it's placed in a league of its own, on its own.  It's so fun to play it demands a sequel.  You can also play as Gordon driving that rust bucket dune buggy and summoning loyal aggresive ant lions that are so poorly scripted they get stuck behind a tree, a house, or a ramp.  Then you will realize it was done on purpose and you're better off selecting one of the main Renegade Ops characters, because they're really bad@ss, and not lucky smart nerds.  And Bryant is one funny character.   Here's an example:  Damsel in distress says, ""We'll have to sneak in.""  Bryant chuckles, and replies, ""Sneaking is not even in the manual.  You know what to do, Renegades.""  BOOM!   I replay that level just to hear that.			"

												Fun twin stick shooting game that isn't very long but still has a lot of replay value.   I actually liked the DLC better than the main game but its only 3 levels.  You can choose from 5 characters with their own vehicles and special moves.  As you play the game you unlock points to upgrade certain abilities in different categories to fit your playstyle, but you can only equip 1-4 of the upgrades at one time.  Graphically this game looks pretty decent as well as having a pretty dope soundtrack.   I got this game for free from Sega, but if I knew it was this much fun I would buy this game.			"

												Great game, had played it a little on Xbox 360 but couldbn't help grabbing it again. The controls are exactly the same as the 360 version, and it works with Xbox One controllers too, so that's handy if you have one of those to hand and not a 360 pad or a Steam Controller.The only downside I had is that it is a little short on first runthrough, and outside of Steam Achievements there isn't an awful lot to keep you coming back - sure, there's 7 playable characters, but all in all you can expect it to last approx. 4 hours in total on Normal, less if you don't pick up the Coldstrike DLC.

												Renegade Ops; A name that explains itself and explains the game at the same time, an underrated little masterpiece that’s jam-packed full of chaos, anarchy, weapons of mass destruction and all in the form of cars and trucks.To call this old-school or retro would do it something of disservice, it’s essentially more original than that. Renegade Ops takes the old classic, then moves them to a modern level with co-op, persistent character and tremendous graphics. The camera angle is familiar with a style of zooming around a large map in a distinctive style to Desert Strike, but a little more intense.The campaign has an interesting climax to it with a dry sense of clichéd humour and cheesy one-liners as you complete primary and secondary objectives. As you play, it is liberating and anger relieving to blow-up tanks and cars, run yourself through building, and turn infantry units into road-kill. Renegade Ops offers various ways of controlling your car through a game-pad or keyboard, whatever suits your style of gaming. Overall, it’s a great example of a really enjoyable game based on a simple idea that is executed with care and attention to detail. Altogether, a great single player and co-op game you can play with your friends.			"

												Quick Summary: Top down car shooter with a cheesy story but fun gameplay. You should definitely use a controller for this game instead of keyboard & mouse.You play one of the Renegades, a kind of special ops team under the command of General Bryant who is trying to stop the evil Inferno from launching missiles at innocent people and generally causing chaos. The story is told in motion comic style, and the dialogue is like an 80’s action movie with everyone trying to act/talk macho, but it’s fun and frames the gameplay well. You get to choose from about 7-8 different characters, each with their own “special move” such as temporary invulnerability, heavy firepower, or airstrike. The specials are on a cooldown timer so you can’t spam them but they’re definitely must haves for some of the tougher enemies. Each character levels up independently, and while leveling up doesn’t increase your stats, you get skill points that you can use to buy passive upgrades (such as faster cooldown or better armor). Other than the special moves, the characters are generally the same and all use the same machine gun + whatever secondary weapon you find during the level.Something to note (and it’s actually really annoying) is that even though the game is played in top down perspective, you can very easily flip your car as you’re driving around. Seriously it’s like driving a Halo warthog while viewing from the top and constantly flipping or hitting things that you don’t see very clearly. The end result is that the vehicle is much more difficult to control than it seems and if you’re playing with a keyboard & mouse you will get frustrated very fast (especially when you’re flipped on your back and a dozen guys are shooting at you). Pros:+Very nice graphics and huge maps full of enemies.+Fun cheesy story with a “MUHAHAHA” type villain.+Co-op multiplayer is availableCons:-The car controls can be very annoying since a lot of the areas are very close quarters (such as driving through canyons or villages).-For someone like me who is not used to shoot’em up or bullet hell games, Renegade Ops is rather difficult. You have a limited number of lives for each mission, after which you need to start over. You can grind for levels by replaying missions, but like I said earlier your stats don’t increase, so the game doesn’t really get “easier” even if you’re max level.Overall it’s a fun game, and if you like a challenge you should definitely give it a try.

												It's a really enjoyable game. The graphics are pretty solid and I specially liked seen The Freeman kicking♥♥♥♥♥in his Episode 2 car. A truly renegade! Also, the difficulty gives you a real challenge in some missions, it's not just shooting, it's thinking before shooting too. I liked the split screen mode, not many games have this and I really miss it.			"

Best played in local coop in front of a big flatscreen TV.Great graphics - detailed maps, beautiful explosions and many different enemies to kill.Each battle car you can choose from needs a different way to play.

												Whoever designed the keyboard controls for this game was either drunk or entirely incompetent.  This game is unplayable at any speed with a keyboard.As for a controller, it isn't much better assuming you can find a controller that works with this game. I tried 4 different controllers and the only one it worked with was XBox (not XBox360, not XBoxOne, but ""Classic"" XBox) controller. Did not work with PS3 controller either. Even after getting one to work it was wonky as hell.After finally being able to ""Play"" this game it turned out to be yet more frustration. I thought games were supposed to be fun? Apparently Avalanche and Sega didn't get that memo.			"

												Pretty sweet game. You drive a vehicle around with one controller stick and aim auto attack fire with the other. Add rocket launchers / rail guns / flame throwers and vehicle boost to the mix and you feel like one of those characters from the expendables going gungho-trigger-happy against the baddies. Pros:- Beautifully drawn environments. OMG the fire / dust and water !- Fast-paced non-stop heart-attack-inducing action.- Varied game play - You can fly a copter for example.- New enemies introduced in stages.- Choose characters with unique special weapons ( like Gordon with his AntLions !!! )Cons:- Flippin difficult learning curve. The first few missions will have the AI hand your butt a whoopin.- Long missions where death means you start from the beginning. No checkpoints.- A countdown timer starts exactly when you really need to pee  -_-- Quite difficult to play on the keyboard. Much easier with the controller ( More of a heads up than a complaint ).Buy this game. Nothing beats wiping the grin off of sanguine enemies' face using a rocket launcher. Woot !!!			"

												Renegade Ops, or as I like to call it, ""EXPLOSIONS"", is a top down action arcade type game from the guys behind Just Cause 2, and like Just Cause 2, the story is awful and the game is a blast.  You take control of one of 5 vehicles with an all-direction machine gun and basically roll around blasting every damn thing you see into a dazzling explosion.  A lot of the game is about racking up high scores, allowing for a little competitive gameplay with your friends list, but also offers online multiplayer to allow co-op play as well.  The story has 9 levels and takes about 5 hours to complete, but some will find replay value in the co-op and the ability to level the other characters as well.  It obviously can get a bit repetitive and frustrating to those who lack the hand-eye coordination to drive a car smoothly and fire a directional machine gun, but if you're looking for a fun, arcade-like challenge, you'll find this one well worth the $15 price tag.  Michael Bay would be proud.			"

												Renegade Ops is a top-down vehicular combat game with role-playing elements developed by Avalanche Studios and published by Sega for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.The game has a total of 12 missions, 9 Campaign missions and 3 DLC missions(Coldstrike Campaign). Each mission can be played in the single player mode or local/online co-op.I had this game in my library for a long time, but I just couldn't get into it because of the controls. Steering the car with a mouse and keyboard or aiming with a PS controller analog stick didn't feel that great to me. However, recently I got a Steam controller, and it felt like the game was made for it. Steering the car and aiming has never felt this easy. Still I've seen others that have no problem using a PS controller for this game.The game is a lot of fun, especially in co-op mode with friends.			"

												A great co-op title hampered by Sega publishing. It's fun and takes itself as seriously as it should (not at all) and if you have a buddy or three, grab them and start blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up. It's by the guys who made Just Cause 2, so you know it's a fun title with a wee bit of jank.Seriously I'd really be praising this more but it has some visible rough edges and the usual ""Sega left the PC version to die"" mentality.

												Originaly I had played Renegade Ops on console (PS3) my buddy and I played the crap out of the game leveling up multiple charecters. I saw this game on steam after being a PC convert and this game is so good to me I HAD to buy it again. This game IMO is best played with a game pad. Some Huge differances between console and PC its amazing how much better a simple game is on PC.I had an issue with the game crashing as it started, I have to go into my task manager and ""end task"" of some odd programs that conflict with this game. I rate this game a solid 9.5 of 10 graphics are fancy the game is smooth and polished buildings are destroyable and your charecter is boss at every thing.  There is a vehicle for all the tastes  and upgrades to build up more power. LOVE RENEGADE OPS			"

Posted: March 22, 2016
												So this game isn't even close to as good as the ""old school"" NES games that I grew up playing.  After the first or second level I still had a mostly positive look on this game but as I continued to play it and got deeper into the “experience” my opinion of the title quickly did a complete 180.  Bosses that are just nothing but extra life stealers masked as damage sponges and tend to have a large array of weapon projectiles that can kill you instantly even while trying to avoid their fire.   Common enemy types of all ranges are very damage spongy while you are not, your vehicle’s inability to take any kind of fire even on normal is pathetic and an artificial difficulty addition that is unwanted and poorly designed.  Larger enemy types can literally one shot you from across 2 full screens and you have zero ability to know where the shot will come from because YOU can not see the shooter.  Projectiles are some of the most broken that I can remember in recent memory, more then 50% of the enemy types have homing projectiles which will follow you for literal MILES and turn along with you as you attempt to break the lock which is impossible, all you can do is ride it out and hope you survive long enough and avoid getting stuck in the game’s horrible level geometry.  Later levels have you pitted against flame thrower enemies, which normally you wouldn’t worry about.  In this “game” however fire units do INSANE damage to you and perhaps the best part is it’s also damage-over-time, something that an “old school” game like this should never have.  It sure is “FUN” when you’re pitted against multiple of the harder to kill flame thrower vehicles and you’re just killed by DOT rather then the actual hits, that sure is FUN and BALANCED right?  On top of everything else hitting you, splash damage is a significant threat as 80% of the projectiles fired at you have more then 90% of their damage go to you should the shot miss and impact next to you.The vehicle handling is something out of......god I don't even know how to categorize it, it's awful, never knew an OLD SCHOOL game could put the player in so many situations where you literally roll over, and before you say anything yes I am using a 360 controller.  If you thought Borderlands or GTA4 had some of the worst driving controls in history think again, this title by far takes the gold trophy for flat out being the worst handling vehicle and driving mechanics in any game Period.  You will get stuck on every single surface and all while being shot at 99% of the time, the game takes far too long to spawn you while your sitting there on your back like a turtle getting your stomach shot off only to be spawned 1 inch from your current position and be shot at instantly.  You either get stuck on OR you careen off of the side of the many cliffs and mountain sides because, again, your vehicle handles so poorly and unwieldy that you will have to fight your game to retain control, NO proper “old school” top down shooter has ever had this issue.  One of this title’s biggest sins is the one that a few games do and that is making the player fight the controls rather then the enemies in the game universe.  If you want to turn your vehicle around you need an entire city block’s worth of room.  While using a controller is useful and somewhat better you may be better off sticking with the keyboard and mouse since you have the ability to use what the game calls “tank controls” which helps the crappy driving controls a bit but if you’re using a controller you are stuck with the horrible controls.Level objectives range from ok to just plain ridiculous, oh and be ready for more then 50% of your total mission objectives, per mission, be timed because nothing says old school like totally arbitrary and pointless mission failing timed mission objectives.  OH yeah and having to watch the same cutscenes over and over and over and over without any ability to skip.  Later missions last upwards of up to 20-40 + minutes and should you die multiple times due to bull crap enemy sight lines or just unfair numbers/projectile spam then have fun REDOING the entire level over for an unknown amount of time until you get lucky and finish it.  There are no checkpoint systems or in game save functions that any normal PC game would have, since this is a poor SEGA console port you get none of the most basic PC game functions.  Speaking of cutscenes the voice acting is quite over the top and after a while grinds on you, normally cheesy lines are funny but really the voice actors are trying FAR too hard to make this title sound serious.While on the subject of having to replay the same mission over and over and over and over and over, the later missions namely 8-9 have some of the steepest balancing curves that I’ve seen in a game labeled “old school”.  The difficulty spike isn’t even fair it is a cliff face there is ZERO progression and you slam your head against a wall of every single difficult enemy in the entire game thus far AND you are in tunnels and small rooms with zero room to maneuver your horribly controlling vehicle and will die to impossible to avoid fire by everything.  Level 9 is quite literally a battle of attrition as it is only a matter of time before you run out of lives after being killed 5 times (on Normal) by honestly bull crap enemies and rooms that simply have you pitted against impossible to avoid fire and odds.  Then later after you’re down to your last life or two you’re expected to do a battle royal in a small disk shaped elevator while the enemies get progressively more and more impossible as the “ride” progresses.  Since your vehicle handles like complete garbage and you have very little effective ordinance compared to your enemies, which by the way you LOOSE every time you die so enjoy trying to beat some hard miniboss/bosses with your starting gun.  Perhaps the best part about dying is that unlike harder games like Ikaruga that give you back your weapons within a timely manner after you die this “old school” game does not, in fact after you die you may not even SEE a single upgrade.  Unlike almost every single old school and wanna-be old school shooter worth its salt you can not gain extra lives through score/coins whatever so have fun just having 4 or 5 and a 6th if you’re lucky enough to find the 1UP in only a few levels, they aren’t even in every level.There is an RPG like leveling up system but you level up so slowly at least once you pass maybe level 10 that it becomes moot.  The items that you unlock are not all that useful and more then half of them are disposable, which all RPGs fall into the trap of having 1 or 2 good skills and the rest being filler for the skill tree.  Since it takes you so long to actually get anything useful you’re also halted from using more then 1 or 2 until much later in the levels so you’re even limited on what you can bring to the fight which is not saying much quite honestly.  The developers expect you to try all of the other vehicles which for me is around 8 or so but it’s large amount given the fact that your skills and levels DO NOT transfer over from character to character so have fun being on the lowest level if you decide to play with another character.  I honestly can not say that I’m looking forward to that especially since I’d have to go through the entire game over again each time with each character.The coop that this title offers is really nothing to write home about, rather then following basic SMART design choices the devs chose to allow teammates to hit one another with their vehicles. Along with that you and your team do not share pickups so if you see a weapon upgrade you’d either grab it first or watch as all 3 of your teammates tries to get it first, this design flaw also encompasses health pickups as well.

												only played half our of Gatling Gears. Because i found Renegade Ops, cooler action and happenings with athmosphere!. This game is A MA ZING Range Rover. Check. Mounted .50 cal machine gun. Check. Even bigger gun ready to spring out of the boot. Check. Driver's name is Gunnar. Check. Why hello there ""Expendables, the game."" how are you today? No, I'm not confusing the games here, this is the game that the Expendables license should have been slapped on, it has everything you could possibly want. Big over the top villains, a thoroughly ludicrous story, a main protagonist so masculine that you will feel testosterone seep out of the monitor, and a crew who either should be skydiving, in jail, or both.The game runs incredibly smoothly, even when there's a lot going on, and there's enough graphical whizzbangery combined with the over the top explosions (yes, everything blows up, and blows up spectacularly) that you'll feel like you just took a seat in a movie theater to be greeted by Sylvester Stalone and Jason Statham fistbumping. Athmospehre and feeling of great gameful action.  wow also co-up.  niiiiice .Both control types ARE great . . i use that ""tank control"" rarely, but its really good too.in this game you CAN get USE from your driving skill too, its so good thing.Enough those easy ipad /flash games already damit !- use gamepad if you have trouble with keyboard. but i like it with keyboard.I had to run first mission about 4 times to get enough XP to finish it. so what its actually fun to just play this.10 different characters with customisable guns and features to suit your fight style  :) this is arcade heaven			"

												This game is recommendable for its co-op alone. Like blending some kind of micro-machines racer but without the competitive element and the ability to blow almost everything up, it's a fast-paced action game amusingly over the top in almost every way. The characters are fantastically polarised and whether the devs intended it or not, it's got Team America all over it. Sega did good. It's a slick, nicely-sized game you could have plenty of fun with. More with a friend though!			"

												I can easily say that Avalanche Studios created the pinnacle of downloadable games, because Renegade Ops is the best one available on the market right now. It's certainly among my favorite games. It not only brings back memories of the good old Strike series (Desert, Jungle, Urban, etc.) in its own way, but also demonstrates what it takes to produce a top-notch, highly polished title. Everything is in the right place about this game: gameplay, controls, graphics, sounds, physics, characters, the likeable story and script, the crazy voice acting, the missions and the maps, the co-op feature... I could go on. Another great thing about it is that on Hardcore difficulty it's actually hard! After all those easy games, this one is in fact a real challenge. By the way the DLC is a great addition too. I'm surprised though that it is so aggressively discounted everywhere. But no matter the price, Renegade Ops is totally worth your time. You're a fool if you skip this game. Buy it and enjoy!			"

												STORY: It's like a G.I. JOE, with lots of explosion, and a villain lusting for destruction, and some cliche sentences such as ""THIS IS NOT OVER"" and all.ABOUT THE GAMEPLAY: The game has a skill tree to upgrade your vehicle, and two abillities - secondary shot, and special abillitie. Eventually you will be transformed into a helicopter to, which will pretty much keep the same game style. As an +, this game allow you to destroy most of the buildings.PROS: A game simple to play, with a dual stick shoot and drive style, good/detailed graphics, and a nice game experience. I recommed this game to those looking for something mindless, and the ones that want to play with friends.CONS: On the other hand there are some problens on the game, such as: if you spend to much time driving around the map you'll get a 3 minute timer asking you to go after your quest; other negative point's that you'll need a Gamepad to play, or you'll have a hard time playing this game.

												When you see the cutscenes in Renegade Ops, you may view it is a mad little 80's action show cliche throwback  And you're damn right! It's both hilarious, and at the same time, stupidly over the top. So bad, it's good, type cutscenes :)Okay, here's the good - It's a great deal of fun, running around in your little jeep blowing the crap out of enemies. it's also got a nice selection of ""Renegades"" to choose from with differing abilities. And it has a fun little story to follow. I preferred playing as Gunnar btw.Negatives? The keyboard controls are pretty awful. So bad, even the intro to the game recommends a pad! Also, it's not a long game. In just 4.2 hours, I managed to beat the main game AND the Coldstrike DLC. That's pretty damned short.Overall, it's a blast to play in small doses or in co-op. And even if it was short, I can see myself starting up the game in the future, just to have a mess around. Maybe even get some achievements I missed. Recently, someone said it could've been a G.I. Joe game and that blew my mind! Play it with that mindset!			"

												I was surprised that this was a Vehicle game, but hey, I gotta admit, this was very fun, and there were a few updates, so I knew nothing of bugs relating to this game, just some sound issues. The story was very compelling, with two enemies then one surviving somehow and moving onto the DLC (which could of been longer). It was a great game done, all I would want is just some longer missions. Took me around 14-15 hours to complete all the side tasks + the main story on the original game and DLC,  but I got it on a sale so it was perfect.Pros:-- Good graphics-- Sound is above-average-- Great storyCons:-- Short story8/10----Thanks for reading my review!

												The game is basically a twin-sticks arcade shooter, destroy things for fun. The story isn't great, it's just a bad guy doing bad things and a bossy boss telling you to destroy stuffThe gameplay is pretty standard. The controls are easy to learn and respond well (check the options and turn on the tank steering if you have problems driving it). There are different characters, each has a different special skill and skill trees.One thing that I really liked is that the story progress isn't either level bound or character bound, so you can play any of them when you wantPlaying solo is ok, I had a lot of fun, but having a friend makes the experience better.In the end, the game is good, but really overpriced. I suggest waiting for a sale and tell a friend to buy it as well			"

												Did you ever watch GI Joe cartoons back in the 80s? That's what this game feels like. You'll be tearing through the jungle in an armored jeep, blowing stuff to hell while super-villains taunt you.Like, seriously, read that last sentence again. How have you not bought this game?The storyline is straight out of the comics or the old Saturday morning cartoons. The execution is extremely reminiscient of classic arcade games. I could totally see this game being played on an arcade cabinet.My only regret is that it wasn't longer, but that's like being served a t-bone steak and being annoyed because it's a 10-ounce steak instead of a 16-ounce steak. And a 10-ounce steak is perfectly fine for this price.So buy this game if you're hungry because it is a steak.			"

Different cars - with different special abilities and a good number of upgrades for customization. Handles wonderfully and VERY challenging on Hardcore, was definitely made for co-op. Controller supported which is required for a game like this. I need a friend to co-op with - i dont think i can beat it alone on Hardcore mode lol. I have not gotten out of the 1st level - but i am already very impressed and can tell - This is a good game - will definitely continue to play it - even if i keep losing the 1st level - i will beat it eventually!!! hehe			"

												Really good game. Fun to play with your mates. The graphics were surprisingly good, the gameplay was a bit repetitive but also fun. It took me and my friend, I think, four hours to complete the game. A maximum of four players can play together with about six characters. The story isn't the focus so don't expect it to be Hollywood. The upgrade system is a bit meh but it's balanced. All in all, a really good game.			"

												Great Time Kller, but not much!Renegade Ops is like our beloved 2000s arcade games where you shoot shoot shoot, boom boom boom. This is an arcade game and you shouldn't expect any mindblowing story. A group of bad♥♥♥♥♥commandos saving the world while killing millions of enemies with their custom made machinery.The game is pretty fun but not very long. I have beaten the game twice with 2 different characters but I don't think shere's a huge replayability here. Only if you are a High Score monster.I'd recommend the game if you catch a discount.			"

												I beat the game on Normal difficulty, both the main campaign and the little bonus campaign. I'm generally not a fan of twin-stick shooters, but I did enjoy my time playing this game. The controls are tight, and the difficulty on normal was perfect - I couldn't just blindly do whatever I wanted, but it wasn't so hard that I ever ran out of lives on a level, although I got close.I imagine if you're a fan of this style of game, this will be an enjoyable entry. Playing on a harder difficulty would add more time to the game, as well as if you played through it again with the different characters. They seemed varied enough to be enjoyable, for as much as I tried them out. I also imagine that this game would be quite fun for coop, but I never tried it with a friend.The story was entirely irrelevant to my experience with the game, I mostly skipped cutscenes when I could. Its obviously going for a cheesy 80s action movie vibe, which can be entertaining. It definitely doesn't take itself too seriously, which is probably the best praise for a story in a game like this.Overall, I'd would say this game is definitely worth a few bucks, probably more if you really enjoy the genre and are willing to play through multiple times, play on a harder difficulty than me, and go for things like high scores and achievements. I definitely don't regret the time I spent in it.			"

												One of the better dualstick shooters with lots of explosions and an RPG flavored upgrade system. As opposed to super tight twitch shooters like Geometry Wars, the controls in Renegade Ops are a bit floaty since the vehicles have their own weight - however, the gameplay feels right and sets the game apart from other genre favorites. Gamepad pretty much required.			"

												If you've ever played Smash TV or that special zombie mode in black ops, you've played this. It's a top down shooter where anything you point at dies. You control a tank or car as you drive through the level completing timed objectives. You have infinite ammo with your basic machine gun, and then you can pick up things like a flamethrower, railgun, or rockets. I really like it. Once you get used to driving and shooting at the same time, this game is really good. It's simple and fun.Just be sure to have a controller on hand. You won't get far using your keyboard.			"

												This was a great top down shooter.  The graphics impressed me throughout the entire game.  The cars are fun to drive (controller definitely recommended), and destroying/exploding everything in sight is very gratifying.  There are 4 different vehicles, each with their own special ultimate ability.  You level up and earn new perks for your car, which adds another level of making you feel like a destructive god.  The plot isn't horrible, and the over-the-top voice acting is pretty funny.  The co-op is enjoyable and seamless.  Definitely worth playing for the right price.  Took me about 5 hrs to beat by myself and the same with a friend.			"

												Renegade ops is a fantastic 4 player co-op game inwhich you are mercenaries trying to stop a evil organization from destryoing the world!! You and your friends use vehicles with different skills to fight off the enemy drivng through levels and ranking up your vehicle. Its about 3-5 hours of gameplay, great game to pick up on sale.

												Renegade Ops is an all-out shoot 'em up from the old arcade days where little plot, but massive carnage ruled the day. At it's heart, you control one of a number of vehicles (mainly jeep types) that plough through waves of enemies lead by an evil head honcho called Inferno. Upgrades are picked up along the way - each helping you to progress through the campaign.Multiplayer is offered to too, so you're not going in alone and overall, RO is a great diversion from much more serious game types. I would strongly recommend a 360 pad for this game as it's much better suited than K&M for inputs.The only nagging issue I have with the game is that at certain stages, the game suddenly decides that you have 3mins for example to complete the objective at hand. Often, this is not long enough - and tied-in with little in the way of a saved game feature - means that many frustrating replays can be had. Still, it's a very good blaster. Well worth adding to anyone's Steam Library. 8.5/10			"

												This is the definitive twin stick shooter, featuring 2-player local co-op and 4-player online co-op.As with most shooters, the main gameplay mechanics involve moving and shooting; the greatest shooters of all time use these mechanics together to make an interesting game (like how Quake 3 uses fast movement and jumping mechanics with a variety of weapons to make great arena combat, or how Rainbow Six uses slow movement and deadly weapons to make combat deliberate and tactical). The vehicles in Renegade Ops are fast and manueverable, though some are faster than others, which encourages the player to see and dodge enemy attacks, and find better positions to attack from. The fast driving also makes navigating the environment really enjoyable. I especially love using the boost on narrow roads; the dust cloud and vehicle handling makes me feel like a rally driver.The combat is flashy and explodey, with no qualms about its comicbook inspirations. You're supposed to help save people while you actually end up destroying most of their village.... The basic machinegun gets upgraded quickly during missions through pickups, and you can pick up one of three secondary weapons. Each vehicle also has its own special ability; using these in tandem with co-op partners adds to the strategy. From there, tech trees allow you to customize your abilities depending on your playstyle.Finally, this game is not very demanding. I am able to play it on high graphics on my mainstream laptop (A8-4500M, 8GB RAM). It's a blast to connect it to an HDTV and play with friends.			"

												Update... If you go to settings, and change to tank steer, it actually drives the way you would think, make the game 100% better, before i wouldn't have recommended it, but this makes such a difference that its worth plying. Only critisizm i have... the vehicles steer, the helicopter reverts back to the bs steering.. so keybord and mouse seem like the gold star here.Good game with some MAJOR flaws.. It only supports an xbox gamepad and the controls are horrendous.. instead of steering left and right, the WASD keys take you in the direction of the key, which is funddamentally strange. Then the mouse has smoothing or accelleration, and goes all over the screen, but doesn't stand out so you lose in in the firefights with 298 things getting exploded on screen most of the time.. It looks very nice, but it has♥♥♥♥♥♥poor options in general. No rebindable keys, barely playable controls and just a whiff of a game, which could easily be a homerun. The game is fun, but just way more clunky than it sould or needs to be... I will update this after i get a xbox usb gamepad to attempt, the emulator for my ps2 stick only shot/steered in 8 directions, it wasn't analog where i put the stick..  I'm very agitated with steam over this, if its not full controller support, then don't say it is...			"

												I recieved this game in a Humble Bundle, with lots of other Sega games. Out of the six games I had recieved, I left this one until last, as it didn't look like the kind of game that I would like. However, in the spirit of trying new things, I did indeed give it a go.This game does not deserve to be advertised the way it is. It is not featured very often in sales, deals or specials, and it is advertised as a generic arcade game. Renegade Ops is something else. The main objective of the game is to solve various missions, which you are rapidly assigned, using your heavily-armoured car with a turret on top, making for some of the most 'Yippee-Ki-Yay' gameplay since Halo 3.Renegade Ops is a very fast paced game, completely testosterone-fueled and definiteley worth a try for anyone who either:Loves Arcade Games,Loves Third Person Shooters,Loves Driving Games, Loves 100%'ing Games and Picking Up Extras,and Mostly Anyone.However, I am not aware of what price the game currently is, but I would not pay over £5 for it, as the gameplay can seem almost restrictive after playing for too long, the game is hardly Star Ocean: The Last Hope in terms of length, and the gameplay can get a little boring - after over 9000 hours of playtime.

												Even tough the game is reportedly best played with a controller, Rengade Ops is still a great game even when played with a keyboard. Playing with friends is recommended, though. If you don't have friends I would skip Renegade Ops but otherwise, Renegade Ops is a great game and the graphics are astonishing.			"

												7 hour short Singleplayer Game. Dualstick-Shooter where you drive a vehicle around a map. Pretty. Lots of Explosions. Somewhat repetitive gameplay (e.g. you don't destroy only 3 radio stations, you destroy 9) and there are some minor annoyances, but seing as the core game + DLC is just 7 hours short, it's easy to look over them.Story is absolutely laughable. The stuff that a 12 yo would write.			"

												Insane, thumb-blistering, gritty arcade action.This is about as good as it's going to get for this type of game.The story has a great mix of campy, with interesting. The leveling system could be a bit better, but the game really keeps you on the edge of your seat.Local co-op is a blast, and the devs tried a few unique tricks with the camera in local co-op which are hit-and-miss.Well worth the price.9/10			"

												This game is nearly unplayable without a dual-stick controller. With one, it becomes an awesome deluge of gunfire and explosions. Worried about crashing in to a building? No worries! Just drive through it. Mind the cliffs though. The leveling system is paced well enough to not be a detriment to the experience, and it gives you cool upgrades like shorter cooldowns and extra weapon effects. You can play the game cooperatively on the same machine too, but you will need a second game pad for that.			"

												Renegade Ops is a must have for any retro gamer. It takes elements of great games from all eras and it is fantastic. It has amazing graphincs, and I mean amazing, like super releastic. You don't need a beefy PC to pull off the games graphics either because it is not like battlefield playstyle so the birds eye view of the landscape makes it look so good and I love it. It has a more retro playstyle with main objectives and secondary objectives with the birds eye view of your vehicle and is just so much fun to play. The upgrades are great, the story is over the top and suits the game perfecly. The explosions look spectacular and teh weapons and different characters are really fun. This just brings back memories of older games (when games were original, fun, and had quality) but brings newer aspects like leveling, upgrading, and graphics to the table of an already perfected playstyle and combat system. I highly recommend this game.			"

												This has to be an experiment to see if a game can be as just as annoying or more annoying than it is fun. Everything it has going for it is matched by some downside. Here we go:It looks pretty good - even by today's standards for a little top-down game the environments and explosions are lush. If they had dynamic lighting it would look amazing. But it introduces these good looking environments with unskippable cutscenes (I mean the in-engine ones, thankfully you can skip the comic ones). In an arcade game. What?You have several characters to pick from with different abilities and upgrade paths, nice. But they have zero personality and you have to deal with a hyper annoying gung-ho order-barking boss that I really wish could be silenced.The core game mechanics are pretty tight - drive your little vehicle, shoot things, get better guns, shoot things some more, sometimes change to some other vehicle, shoot even more things. That's good in small doses... but this game basically keeps on stacking more and more and more on top of a level. It all takes forever to finish (seriously, it feels like a level goes on for an hour or so, even if it doesn't really) and if you don't succeed you'll start all over again.Well, that was the good stuff... what else is annoying - random falling damage - who knows if you'll survive this jump? Your vehicle clips on things or flips over quite easily. Once again - your idiot boss has just one answer to all of life's problems - blow it up - and he'll use every single chance to yell it out to you. Achievements are once again more annoying than interesting, forcing you to juggle tasks within the timed missions. There's more, but this is already long.So why recommend it? Well, if you like this sort of game there aren't many options on PC. It does look good, things do blow up quite nicely and you do power things up so the missions start to flow a little faster. If you are ready to grit your teeth a good deal give it a try.			"

												Finally! An over-head perspective vehicle shooter with almost complete freedom in where you want to go and what you want to do! It's like someone took Jackal for the NES, the Jungle Strike Series of 16-bit games, and some of the more recently incorporated arcade games seen on console marketplaces, and mashed them into the exact formula needed to make a classic-feeling game in a not-so-classic-anymore feeling era for gaming. Yes that was all one sentence. This game is well worth the price tag even at launch, and a MUST-grab when it's on discount at all. I don't say that lightly, because I'm the type of person who beat Mass Effect 4 times back-to-back, know the story like the back of my hand, and yet I still didnt pay full price for the sequel despite my insane love for the franchise. I usually don't dish out anymore than 20 dollars for any game, but if this game was only ever going to sell for 21, I'd break my principles. If you're on the edge over it, allow me to push you towards Buy.			"

												This is like an 80s Saturday morning cartoon mixed with a twin-stick shooter.  The game uses a lives system in a reasonable way, letting you get more in levels and also giving you an easy option which makes them unlimited, while also eliminating the upgrade features.  If you lose all your lives in a level, you keep any experience you've gotten, so you can upgrade and try again.  The game mainly focuses on standard ""Go here, shoot this stuff"" objectives, while also giving you secondary objectives.  There's a balance between completing the secondary and the time-sensitive primary ones.  Also you can play as Gordon Freeman and summon Antlions.  It's not exceptional, but if you like twin-stick shooters, it's a lot of fun.  Protip: Play with a controller.  It's more difficult with mouse and keyboard.			"

												Your commander is none other than Timesplitter's Sgt. Cortez. That's enough to buy this game on it's own. Here's the kicker though. It's a decent twin stick, Co-op shooter on it's own, so it's got that going for it, which is nice. If you're looking to kick back with a score-attack arcade style shooter (and listen to Sgt. Cortez give you mission directions, Which I cannot stress enough, His VO is like melting butter over a fresh english muffin) and blow some stuff up, give it a try.			"

												Beautiful game with smooth graphics obliterated by terrible mechanics. No saves, so you have to play a level over and over. I still haven't beaten level one. Terrible controls. You dont directly control your vehicle, but rather push it towards a compass point and it finds it's own way there. Then shooting, despite the game virtually requiring a dual stick (Analog) game pad, you can only shoot in about 8 directions. The enemy is invariably between two of your firing angles, which could be ok IF you could control your vehicle directly, which you can't. If you're not frustrated by the fact that the computer has no restriction on firing arcs, doesn't get stuck, can drive right at you, and out numbers you, then just wait until it throws tanks at you that never miss and you probably can't destroy. An hour into it, and I'm done. Hope the un-installer works. But gosh, it sure it a pretty game.			"

												This is one of my favorite games, and it became so seconds after playing it.  They perfected the 'twin stick shooter', the dynamic split screen effect is PERFECT.  All developers should mimic what they did with the split screen on this game -- but you have to go into settings to enable it.  The physics engine in this game is fantastic and simply driving the trucks or helicopters around is a lot of fun.  I beat the first level and I literally went back and beat the first level 10 more times in a row.  It's that good. BUY IT!  Get it on sale though.  Don't hesitate to get the four pack.			"

												I'm not going to say this is a bad game. It's actually pretty decent. However, since the question is, ""Do you recommend this game?"" I'm going to say 'no' because it's really boring and painfully repetitive. The first mission is so long and drawn out, I got the impression after completing the second mission, I'd already seen everything this game has to offer already. No new upgrades, no new enemies - just the same thing I already did. Especially at a $15 non-sale asking price? Nuh-uh.I got this for free as part of a Humble Bundle, I think - that's about a reasonable price.			"

												First of all, I hate writing negative opinions. Game must try really hard to♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, and this one managed to do so within few levels.It's a twin-stick shooter that is too hard to control with analog sticks. Using mouse helps, but not much - I get what they were trying to acheive, but in the end, it's a mess. Maps are complex and not very intuitive, targets are small and unnecessary tough. May be, if it was a little easier, it would've been a really fun game.			"

												tl:dr  --->   7/ 10  there's Gordon Freeman, satisfying gameplay, some choppers and occasionally annoying controls Although the game is a very fun time waster, the absurd control scheme occasionally makes the effort of maneuvering into tight spot or trying to stay on top of inclined platforms a nightmare. There is no button for simply reversing the car, the accidental falling off of platfroms will cost you many lives, unintentionally forcing you to play in casual difficulty. Another drawback is that you are disabled from purchasing any upgrades in casual difficulty, rendering all special skills of all vehicles virtually useless, turning the game into a monotone shootfest.But hey, you can drive that sweet ride from Half Life 2, spawn cool Antlions, and even see a wee little Gordon Freeman in the driver's seat.

												Recommend ONLY ON VERY DEEP SALE.PROS:- Shooting is fun. - Graphics looks good.- If you like maxing out skills, there are many cars for that.CONS:- If you don't build one favorite car from the first stage, you'll be very frustrating in the later stage because of the difficulty spike. You'll end up with mediocre cars and you'll need to grind to survive. - Bad control. Turning isn't tight and there are objects on screen that you could get stuck on. If you're stuck while there are too many enemies around, you're done for. - No button for reverse, in a car game. Nice.DEAL BREAKER:The game crashes from time to time. My PC: i7-6700 4.0 GHz, GTX1060 6GB, 32GB RAMSaving and upgrading only happens between stages. You fight through hordes and hordes of enemies and the game crashes, with all the XP gone. You know the feeling. That happened to me 3 times in 2 hours, so that's it. I'm out.Too bad I can't recommend this game due to all its flaws combined. It's a fun twin-stick shooter but not enough to make me push through the frustration.			"

												This ""game"" is terribley awkward and counter intuitive in a few ways.  There are two control schemes:  cardinal directions where up is up, down is down, etc., and ""tank"" controls where up is forward and steering is reletive to the car.  I'm not sure why it's labled ""tank"" because that's not how a tank works.  Aiming is much easier with the mouse because you can aim directly at a target and there is no spot you can't hit.  With the stick you have notches and gaps that leave dead zones between where your shots go.  If you park in one spot and rotate the gun stick there are spots you can't quite reach.  As a result, you have to try and balance dodging enemy fire with lining up your limited shot lanes.  Then there are the objective markers that don't seem to know where they're going.  They sort of aim you down the road, but suddenly change direction.  It woulsd make more sense if they just pointed at the objective itself rather than try to follow the road.  I suppose if I really worked at it I would eventually get the hang of it, but it's just so annoying and frustrating that I lose interest very quickly.  Just like I could probably eventually learn to ride a bike by sitting bacwards on the handlebars, looking in a mirror, while juggling with one hand.  But that's a lot of effort to learn such a limited use skill set.  Maybe if there were more games like this it would be worth it to learn, but this game alone isn't even very fun to begin with.			"

												Awesome arcade goodness, as fun as you can expect from a PC title. Feels a bit like Micro Machines, with the driving on a keyboard leading to some pretty hilarious results, but in the mayhem of multiplayer it's difficult to spot. The gameplay is spot on, the graphics, sound and speech effects all top notch. And the storyline (!) makes Proust look shallow!Multiplayer is definitely where the fun is, easy to get going (except when Steam is down) and no major problems with lag. On the down side, there are a few issues with odd bugs, some even causing the game to crash. Also, a decision on the part of the developers has you able to hoover up health packs for some measly points when at full health - which is fine in single player, but can really duff up a good multiplayer game when your average driver is drawn to anything shiny like five-year-olds round an ice cream van.

												RO is just an utter thrill to play. The game feels like a fleshed out version of the imaginary adventures I'd play as a kid with my GIJoe toys in a sandbox with your little car shooting ALL THE BULLETS ON EARTH at the bad guy army which has nothing better to do than sit in front of you eating lead. The handling of the cars are a little squirrely and you don't have much in the way of standoff ranged attacks, but the crazy driving and shooting coupled with the ridiculous dialogue and laughable overkill of the bad guy makes this a delight. I love the way that the cars kick up dust, peel out,  and roll with the terrain, and I wish the few helicopter sequences were as well executed. There's a bit of RPG fun going on as well since each character has a unique playstyle and different augmentations you can acquire to improve your offense and defense. Co-op play is great fun too but makes things a bit easier than the normal single play challenge. Totally worth playing!			"

												EXPLOSIONS!  That is what this game is nearly every second you aren't watching a comic-book style cutscene you can't bypass.  This game is a tremendous amount of fun sandwiched between over-wraught narrative.  Seriously, did the people who made this game think we needed a reason to destroy half of the planet in a dune buggy?  If you constantly have to get up to get something to drink or pee and have a couple minutes to waste while the game is trying to justify your rampaging, get this game.  The actual gameplay is magnificent.REQUIRES A GAMEPAD.  I learned this the hard way but the resultant gaming experience is worth it.			"

												This is a really fun arcade shoot-em-up. I recommend using the ""Tank Controls"" setting with keyboard and mouse rather than gamepad. It means that forward, backward, left and right are oriented to the vehicle rather than the screen. It makes the game a bit more difficult but it's how I, and I'm sure many other fans of games like Micro Machines, am used to playing.I have finished the Inferno campaign on Normal difficulty using the character with the EMP special ability. The attention to detail and level design in Renegade Ops is great.			"

												The first thing to strike me about this game is how terrible the controls are. The keyboard controls are horrific and the joypad ones are playable but far from natural to use. The other big thing of note about this game is the difficulty. I have often said that I think games should be fun. I didn't get too far with normal difficulty so I dropped it down to casual. However the leveling up and customisation of your character is not available in casual. I don't mind a game having hard settings but I do feel that all of the game's features should be available to those of us who just want to enjoy the game. Each of the characters has a special ability but half of them seem almost useless. I did like the comic book style used in the cutscenes but otherwise there was nothing too inspiring about this game. So overall I'd give this game a miss.			"

												I've played a lot of top down action/shooters and those in my Steam library are only a small part of all the TD games I've enjoyed so far.  But Renegade Ops seems to be something else. I really liked this game from the moment I've first seen it. Awesome graphics, nice sound effects, cool level design and an entire world of destruction.  But when I got the game and tried playing it...Sure' it still has those things that made me wanna buy it and for me they looked even better than in the trailer.Unfortunatelly this game has one HUGE issue - the controls. When you start the game you're told that this game plays better with a gamepad. I ignored that and decided to give it a try with the mouse & keyboard. The result was a hour of frustration that made me wanna throw my display off the window. The controls are super sensitive and you almost never seem to get the right way to tap to make the truck go where you want it so you'll basically drive like a drunk man or a snake in the sand. And since you can get your truck stuck in all sorts of places (between a wall and a building for an instance), you CAN'T DRIVE BACKWARDS so you'll have to struggle to get out.Moreover, since the enemy troops and trucks are stationed between buildings' you'll have a hard time killing them without dying since, as I said, steering is a pain in the...neck. So eventually you'll end up dead not because you can't get avoid the enemy fire.So after trying 3 keyboards, thinking my keyboard is way too sensitive, and a painful keyboard experience, I switched to controller. I tried using 2 controllers, one of them being an Xbox 360 gamepad.While it was a little better the problems were still there. Impossible steering and direction and no reverse.To avoid dying I decided to play on Casual, something I never did with any game I've played EVER. Everything was OK (except of course you can't level up on Casual) - the truck seemed to be tougher and enemies less efficient so I managed to get to the part where you are given a helicopter. And here I encountered the first bug TWICE in a row. On Normal and Hardcore you have to shoot the container to reveal the helicopter and to get it. However, on Casual I was already in the helicopter when it shipped in, yet my objective was to retrieve the package. Of course this was impossible so I failed the mission. And instead of respawning as if I died, I lost the game so I had to start all over again. And second time, same problem. 


Stupid bug in Renegade Ops! 
A Screenshot of Renegade Ops
By: daydr3am3r87




To sum it up, I've played about 3 hours (it seems my Steam progress changed from about ~150 minutes to 50 minutes after my last attempt to play this game) and I still haven't finished the first mission. And since I cannot save, I must start all over again and again and again and...So NO. It has the WORST control system I've encountered in my life. And I've played hundreds pf games. I'll most likely finish it someday but it's hard to get this game a good review.STAY AWAY (unless you like playing on casual). 6/10 (Because I like the graphics and sound effects and because someone actually worked in that team :X )			"

												For me and my friend, we cannot even pass the first scenario on medium mode, while easy mode does not apply upgrades. The pick-ups give a minimal amount of HP recovery and secondary weapons, which are easily depleted and dragged the gaming pace down. The default vehicle control is unreasonably hard and I recommend to set the steering on. Certain characters' speacial abilities are more efficient than others. The only thing I preferred in this game is its comic style dialogues.			"

												Those who played Micro Machines by Codemasters will find similarity here. From creators of poorly known Just Cause Avalanche Studios gives us another game Renegade Ops. You take control one of 7 different characters who must stop global terrorism caused by villain Inferno. While not much of story itself provided in game, the gameplay on the other hand gives us tons of fun and replayability. Running over soldiers, blowing up jeeps ,tanks and buldings is fun. As you progress through levels completing objectives and secondary ones you gain xp to upgrade your character in 3 possible ways, like offensive, defensive and special ability. Also to note that you can play it 4 player coop which is awesome if you think about it. Mostly spending 5-6 hours to complete single player storyline you can also buy dlc which adds a new campaign, so better than nothing. Its not great arcade of decade but decent one to play at least.

												It's like Surgeon Simulator but with explosions. Graphics are great and low resources. It's awesome the vehicle's are able to jump and fly around through terrain. At the same time it's very very difficult. On normal mode I've attempted to beat the first level multiple times and only get about half way through. Sure there's easy mode but this has no leveling to your character! Eventually I'll upgrade enough playing over and over to progress but I wish it wasn't this way. ava_main crashes on occasion, losing progress. Perhaps I just suck or kboard players have a disadvantage? I got it on deep discount and I'm still not quite sure it was worth it.			"

												They only did ""Full Controller Support"" for this game - which means my logitech PS3 style controller is not recognized by the game. The keyboard and mouse controls are so bad that I cannot steer the car down the road in order to make it through the first turn of the game. I'm very dissapointed in this as the game looks promising. I will have to buy the Microsoft Wireless Receiver for Windows in order to connect an Xbox controller to my PC to be able to play this one. After I do that, I will be able to write a full review.

												The leaaring curve for this game's difficulty is much too steep, and the easier difficulty modes strip out large gameplay mechanics instead of just adjusting damage and health. Gameplay is repetetive, and it could really benefit from a minimap. Other wise the game is good, good grphics, runs fine, basic gameplay mechanics seem good. I just can't recommend this because there are other far better top-down vehicle shooters out there.			"

												The controls ruin what might be a fun game.  The graphics and intro got me excited for some fun action like MERCS or Return Fire (really dating myself on those two).  I was even hoping for some ridiculous Sega things, like House of the Dead Overkill.  I was provided with terrible, unmapable controls.  Over the top difficulty that forced me to grind the first level (controls don't help with this).  Obviously one of those slap dash Xbox 360 ports.  Glad it was free, but I wish I could use it as a coaster.			"

												Uhm, well... it's an ok twin-stick shooter game. I read some reviews prior to playing this and I was under the impression that this was a sandbox sort of game. You know, like, total freedom. But it's not. There are 9 missions, and you basically always drive a truck, ocassionally switching to a helicopter (why ? It's never explained), on an island that looks completely open, but in reality is not. There are paths that branch off every now and then but you basically follow the same path all the time. And there isn't always time to explore, because every now and then a 3 minute timer begins to count down so you have to race to complete your objective(s). The action is pretty solid and most of the skills are cool to use, but I'll be honest; I expected more. For me it was a disappointment. And a short one at that, clocking in at around 4,5 hours.[Rating: 70/100]			"

												This game brought me memories of titles like Twin Cobra, or Silkworm.Unfortunately it isnt as entertaining.Good visuals, horrid controls, equally to controlling a slippery fish, while it writhes around.You cannot map keys, so you are stuck with one control scheme which can slightly change into an alternative one which is equally horrid.And all this happens while you get shot from all sides. The game obviously prefers to be played on a controller, it goes as far as to remind that every time the game starts.But what if I dont have one or dont wish to buy one?Am I screwed?I cannot recommend this game is it is right now.Period.sega should have invested a little bit of time to make the controls mappable in a game like this.I forgot to play this under two hours so I cant get a refund for it, which is a pity, even though I got the game on sale.

Game would be fun, the engine is great which makes for fun driving and sweet explosion effects, and if they made an ARPG out of this (they won't) it would be ♥♥♥♥ing incredible.

												I'd classify Renegade Ops as a twin stick shooter and from that aspect, it's okay. Unfortunately, the driving mechanics aren't that great and I found my vehicle regularly flipping and fishtailing uncontrollably. I think it's because I prefer using the triggers to accelerate and brake. Using only the left stick to direct the vehicle just feels weird to me. And that means there's no reverse, so you end up getting stuck in certain spots as a result. And there is no ability to customize the controller configuration.Storywise it feels like a G.I. Joe comic book with Inferno being the Cobra Commander bad guy. Actually the story almost perfectly mimics the cartoon series G.I. Joe Renegades. It's not bad, but it's easy to overlook.While I have yet to play coop, my impression is coop is what makes this game fun. But overall, a game like Zombie Driver is much more enjoyable as a driving shooter.			"

												Renegade Ops is mediocre. It's another Sega game. Making average games with nothing special about them seems to be Sega's specialty. The basics of the game are solid, it's just nothing is really done to make it compelling. If any of the makers of the game actually cared, this could've been a fun game. The story and writing are a joke. The gameplay is very retro. There isn't that much by way of varied enemies. It seems like I only ever needed to use two tactics the entire game. When fighting a bunch of enemies, just drive back and forth perpendicular to where they're coming from and for the big tanks just keep running circles around them, blasting them until they're done. I had technical problems on the last level of the regular game. It crashed three times on me so I had to do the level extra times. It's frustrating cuz there are no check points and the last level is long. A definite sign that a game isn't very good is that it just felt like work re-doing a level when I died. There was no joy in it. The DLC added a few snow maps which got repetitive. The graphics definitely have a console port look to them. The game took about 5 hours to beat with the DLC (which was about an hour by itself). I'm sure you can find a better game than this to play.			"

												From what I've played...it looks good.  The gameplay is fluent, the power ups were...few and far in between, and shooting everything was quite enjoyable.  I found the poke towards Gordan Freeman to be unique and cool, especially how accurate it was.There are problems however.  Mainly...the challange.  Firstly, I started on normal.  You can take damage so quickly, and it requires almost absolute perfection and path planning to avoid bullets.  What's more, your car is very topsy turvy, and if you flip over, you are completely vulnerable.  You can't shoot, you can't right yourself back up.  You have to wait until the game does it for you.  And because of this, you can end you getting absolutely destroyed because of it.  It seems like so much is thrown at you and little freedom is given to finish an objective AND a side objective.  Maybe it was geared more for co-op or multiplayer or something of the like (which seems to be a growing trend).  Or maybe it's just because Gordan doesn't have the most well armored car.  Either way...it could've been better.			"

												Graphic effects, music, concept and aesthetics are at very high level. I just don't understand why such a good game was ruined by so bad and unintuitive steerings.First I've tried to play with WASD. I was in shock because it was impossible to play in this way. So I turned on game options and got astonished, because you can't change any keys in there. Second try was with Xbox controller. I was hoping it'll be fine now, but I got surprised again - with gamepad playing is at all possible, but it's still fully unintuitive and very hard to handle. Person responsible for this should be fired from work and then burn in hell. Seriously I've played many games of this type and Renegade Ops steering is worst I've ever seen!At all it's a very poor PC port of an console game.			"

												really a fun title, reminds me on a mix of command&conquer and the old playstation one game vigilante 8 :Dthe graphics and animations are pretty nice to look at, the sounds are good too. the music is good, but i turned it off to hear the motor sounds better.in my eyes its, together with payday:the heist,  the most underrated game 2011.you can play alone or in coop with friends. its worth the investment!

												Renegade Ops is one of those games that just makes you feel good.It doesn't need to be complicated, or with huge depth. Its just fun to play, nice to look at and simple. If you were a fan of the Soviet/Nuclear Strike games from PS1 days then you'll understand immediately.I personally really like the style/graphics and sound, and for the most part, the gameplay mechanics too. Granted, its not the most involved game to play and after a while it starts to become a little repetitive, but you're never going to be sinking 00's of hours into it anyway. Pick up and play, complete the campaigns with your friends. It has solid netcode, runs well on lowish spec computers and generally doesn't cause any fuss.8.5/10 from me for the price to fun ratio, and the lolz factor with friends. "

												This game could have been awesome, but unless you have a Xbox 360 controller you're basically ♥♥♥♥ed. There is no support for using any other controllers, the keys of the keyboard cannot be defined, and i couldn't even get my 8bitdo Pro controller to work via pinnacle game profiler. I really can't understand why companies like Sega can design such a good game with such pissy ♥♥♥♥king controls that ruin the whole thing. If you could just define your own keys or change the driving style from twin stick to something more sane (on a keyboard) this would be a great game, and they would sell more copies.good game, terrible controls, 4/10 would shove controller up my butt in frustration again.

												Renegade ops belongs in the twin-stick shooter genre and a controller is recommended. It takes a while to get a grip on the shooting because movement is physics based. This brings an element of randomness to the driving which can lead to unintentional crashing and rolling over. Same rules apply to enemies as well and the game is mostly just a beautiful chaos. Weapons are powerful enough and sound like they mean business. Enemy variation could be higher since the same ones repeat over and over again but personally i got so much out of the destruction that i wasn't bored.Player takes control of a single vehicle from a selection of 5 (+2 with DLC). Each of these has a special ability and look different but mostly operate on same way. You can pick up better weapons and health from fallen enemies and since these are random you can either be really lucky or stuck with your crappy level 1 machine gun for a long time. Any experience you gather is automaticly saved which is great since it makes failing a bit easier to swallow. Upgrade system lets you choose a bit of what to focus on but doesn't make a huge difference. You can only use 4 skills at a time and for example i liked Gordon Freeman (yes, the) because of his antlions. 4th upgrade slot opens at level 30 and at that time i allready had all of the skills a liked. So from 30 to max level of 45 i used the same skills.Graphics are colorful and great. Scenery changes often depending on the mission so there is plenty of variation. Frame rate stayed solid even though at times the action and set pieces are just insane. During my 8 hours (of which about 2 was with DLC missions) with the single player the game crashed once but otherwise worked without problems.I have no problems with the overall lenght of Renegade Ops. What i do have problems with is the lenght of individual missions. Normally a single mission takes about 20 minutes to complete and there are no checkpoints in the game. Especially in a game that puts the player on the mercy of a physics engine this is at times really frustrating. Missions starts with (depending on the difficulty) 3-5 lives and you can get one extra from a skill. You can also find extra lives but most i managed to find in a level was one. Casual mode is also available but it disables upgrades and other good things about the gameplay.On medium lack of checkpoints is no problem but on Insane it takes one little mistake and few bad respawns to lose 3 lives in 30 seconds. I suspect that insane difficulty is meant for co-op which i didn't have the possibility to try out. It's for 4 players and if it works as well as single player it should be a blast with friends! It should be much faster to complete the game in co-op so take that into consideration.I got a suprising amount of enjoyment out of a game that i though i'd get bored in half an hour. Renegade ops is stupid fun and i liked it a lot!			"

												I wanted to like this game, I really did. At first, it was fun, but then the timed stuff started. The control sensitivity, even when toggled, is just not made to be able to reasonably accomodate such a mechanic. That and when you do die, you're stuck having to watch the same clips over and over again with no way to skip them. Together, these gripes are enough to make me say it's not worth playing.			"

												In this extremely annoying top-down shooter your drive an armored vehicle through a series of levels, plowing through buildings and blowing up waves of enemies on the way. The problems with this concept are obvious from the first minutes: first of all, your field of view is very limited due to the perspective. This means it's difficult to drive at speed, you're constantly taking fire from off-screen and you have to keep shooting at the edge of the screen in anticipation of enemies. With all the explosions and chaos it's especially difficult to spot and dodge enemy missiles, as they get covered up by the completely ineffective enemy machine gun fire. The whole concept feels archaic and I can't think of a way the game wouldn't be improved if it used a standard 3rd person camera.Secondly, all of the main mission objectives are on a timer, which only actually appears on the screen 2.30 before time is up. I assume this was supposed to keep the pace fast, but in practice it's to easy to get caught up in optional secondary objectives and run out of time, which means replaying the whole mission. You can't explore the maps at your own pace, and the timer is infuriatingly even ticking down when you're fighting a boss. It feels like a completely pointless punishment. The same can be said of the old-fashioned lives system, which forces you to retry to whole stage should your run out of lives.Lastly, the controls are quite imprecise with a keyboard and a mouse, plus you can't rebind them. That's a nail to the coffin for a game that requires a constant slalom amidst enemy fire. Unless you have a supreme control of your left pinkie, it's also going to be really hard to boost (left shift) while steering left with A.All these issues make Renegade Ops a nuissance insead of light entertainment, making it hard to recommend.

Everything about the gameplay is satisfying: destructible environments, dirt clouds, effortless drifting, car handling, aiming, etc. Still a great looking game and runs at 60fps when no one payed attention to 60 fps. Multiplayer is a ghost town which is dissapointing but grab a friend and have a great time. Story is cheesy but keeps a good path throughout the levels with little or no backtracking for a great feeling of progression. All you need to know is destroy eveything!			"

												Unfortunately the controls and the camera are really, really bad, which makes the game much more unplayable than it needs to be.I tried playing with my Xbox 360 controller and the steering was ok, but the shooting aim was terrible. Changed to keyboard and got MUCH more accurate shooting with mouse, but I can't change keys from WSAD! Seriously... WHY do developers not take the time to code the ability for players to change controls?? It takes ALMOST NO TIME AT ALL in comparison to the time taken to code the rest of the game.Also, there should be an option to have the camera rotate with whatever vehicle you're in control of. This would make controlling the vehicle much more simple with both KB/mouse or controller.Also... WHY is there no minimap!!!????			"

												For optimal enjoyment of Renegade Ops, follow these simple pointers.1) Leave your braincells and neurons at the door, you won't be needing them.2) Pick a driver and a mission.3) Drive like the devil wants you dead4) BSU - BLOW. STUFF. UP.5) Look at all the pretty explosions and wanton propertydamage, and listen to resident former Four-Star General and present Badass give you pointers as to what you absolutely must blow sky-high.6) Watch the points rack up7) Having fun yet? If not, this game is not for you.Renegade Ops is dumb, brainless, undistilled FUN at it's finest. BSU'ing is the name of this game, if you like pretty explosions, over-the-top weaponry  and general badassery, then this game is for you.spent 16 hours on this game from the campaign, and there's 4 player online co-op and splitscreen local.Definitely one of my favorite games.

												This is a real hidden gem in the steam catalog. It's basically like an updated version of Jackal for the NES. The story is campy and GI Joe-esque without resorting to parody. The controls are great on an Xbox 360 controller, but not very good on a keyboard in my opinion. It's fast paced, full of explosions, and a lot of fun. It's difficult without being cheap. I'd imagine the multiplayer is a blast too. Check it out.			"

												A good round of fun to kill time with, Renegade Ops brings to the table good ol fashioned bang bang shoot-em up with classic arcade style play. My only qualm is that its not worth full retail price. Be smart and buy it when it's on sale.+ Blow up everything that isn't a large house to kingdom come+ It has cars+ You get to play as Gordon Freeman+ Arcade style play may induce nostalgia+/- Boss fights require very little strategy. Strafe the boss, fire machine gun and rockets and you're golden- Not worth the full price of admission. Catch this when it's on a sale.			"

Not going to win any awards but if you like this genre of game the controls handle well, it has interesting power ups and upgrades, a leveling system with different characters to choose,  and the story is amusing. One warning though: best played with a controller. The game even warns you of this when you load it... so the keyboard controls must be pretty bad.			"

												Nunca pensei que um shooter tão bom poderia ter elementos de RPG. A princípio parece ilógico, mas o sistema de evolução de Renegade lhe permite jogar o jogo relativamente curto de diversas maneiras distintas. São 03 as classes de atributos dos upgrades de seu veículo armado, defesa, ofensiva e táctica, este último se trata de um poder especial único de cada personagem. Você tem o limite de usar apenas 04 upgrades ao mesmo tempo. A personagem Roxy por exemplo tem um poder especial devastador, uma chuva de mísseis que devasta boa parte do cenário, mas esse poder pode ficar ainda mais assombroso se você usar mais 04 upgrades nele, aumentando seu poder ou raio de ação por exemplo, isso muda completamente sua forma de jogar, pois mesmo com um personagem frágil ainda assim com paciência, escondendo-se e esperando o tempo necessário para resfriar seu poder especial, seu personagem continua sendo mortal e perigoso. Ou se preferir, pode deixar sua personagem mais equilibrada, adicionando dois upgrades de defesa e dois de ofensiva, sem evoluir o já poderoso poder especial, assim sua forma de avançar no jogo muda radicalmente, você já tem condição de partir para cima dos inimigos sem ficar tão dependente do poder especial. Agora multiplique isso por 07,  quantidade de personagens (veículos), e multiplique mais uma vez por 12, quantidade de fases disponíveis, contando as DLCs e vc perceberá que esse ""pequeno"" jogo na verdade tomara muitas horas de sua vida. Os gráficos são um show à parte, a visão distante e superior permite enxergar uma riqueza imensa de detalhes, como o voar de pássaros, o levantar da poeira do chão na passagem de um helicóptero. Efeitos de iluminação detalhistas impressionam nas fases noturnas, explosões fenomenais mais se assemelham a um espetáculo de pirotecnia e a sensação térmica e destrutiva passada pelos efeitos de chamas  é de cair o queixo.O jogo é charmoso, e a história é contata no formato de desenhos em quadrinhos feitos à mão, exatamente como em uma HQ. O que para mim é um sonho, visto que cresci lendo gibis, e sim, isso muito me agradou.A jogabilidade funciona muito bem no controle do 360, onde o analógico esquerdo  move o veículo enquanto o direito move a mira, permitindo um dinamismo raro na maioria dos shooters de se mover e atirar em direções diferentes. É uma pena não poder dizer o mesmo do teclado e mouse onde fica mais complicado dirigir o veículo, e é uma pena também o jogo não oferecer suporte a outros controles, apenas ao do 360. Mais a melhor parte deixei para o final. O multiplayer, tanto splitscreen (offline) para até 02 pessoas, como o online para até 04 pessoas é muito divertido. Na verdade como todo bom shooter deveria ser, o jogo deve ser jogado preferencialmente no multiplayer cooperativo onde as campanhas podem ser terminadas mais facilmente. Tentar zerar o jogo sozinho no Hard é penoso, você vai querer a ajuda de um amigo. Sem falar que alguns personagens foram criados pensando exatamente nesse modo, como Crystal, que emite um campo de força de energia grande o suficiente para proteger você e mais 03 amigos das balas inimigas. De falhas o jogo tem um bugs irritantes, como por exemplo a exigência do caríssimo controle do 360, o que é absurdo visto a simplicidade da jogabilidade do game, e absurdo maior ainda, não poder jogar o modo cooperativo local com dois  teclado/mouse wireless por exemplo, e mais absurdo ainda não poder  jogar esse mesmo modo com um teclado/mouse e seu amigo com o controle do 360... OU SEJA, VC PRECISA COMPRAR DOIS CONTROLES DO 360 PARA APROVEITAR ESSE JOGO AO MÁXIMO. É o recado da Avalanche Studios para os seus fãs... "

												This game has incredible visuals along with a fantastic explosion/destruction engine which makes it so much fun!Being only ~5 hours long it allows you to play through it feeling like it doesn't drag on for ever. Each level is ~20-30 minutes which is very frustrating if you die as there are no save points or checkpoints to start from. After I finished the game, I enjoyed it so much I had no problem starting again on a harder difficulty. Good selection of characters and vehicle upgrades. Haven't had the chance to try out multiplayer but I'm sure that it would be really enjoyable. Seeing as it was on special for ~$4 it is well worth the money!Overall: 9/10			"

												Remember that old top-down vehicle shooter called Jackal on the NES? Well, I can easily call this Jackal^2. While not related to it in any way (as far as I know), Renegade Ops features concepts based on Jackal: top-down vehicle shooting, blowing stuff up, rescuing civilians... blowing stuff up. However, take this tip for when you first start: MAKE GOOD USE OF YOUR SUBWEAPON AND ABILITY. Maybe if you're enough of a badass, you can get by with shooting alone, but you'll probably want to use your subweapon, whether rockets or countermeasures, and your special ability, which is dependant on which character you select (speaking of characters, you can play as Gordon Freeman from HL2, exclusive to the PC version). However, you'll have to deal somewhat bad voice acting as well as a very bare-bones options menu (although the game looks great and runs well on my rig). A game that i'd recommend to anyone who likes blowing stuff up.			"

												I love this game, it really does channel the magic of knockabout old-school shooters.  The world is a delighfully hammy, over-the-top version  of now, with a scenery-chewing super-villain hell bent on exploding the world.  Only your team of 4 mercs (and Gordon Freeman with Antlions for some reason) in their various vehicles can stop hime.Played from the top-down, each buggy, jeep and tank poerslides across the screen, controlled by a responsive twin-stick control scheme.  You can be powersliding across the screen, unleashing hell behind you and then fire off superweapons to bring down a zepelin.  Occasionally the action takes to the air via assault chopper.The game's best played in co-op, each of you causing everything on the screen to explode, competing for power-ups, and upgarding your vehicles in new and interesting ways.It's highly recommended.  You can drop in for 20 minutes of fun, or blast through one of the campaigns over an evening or two.  It's plenty challenging, and never outstays it's welcome.  Make sure you have a gamepad for true enjoyment!			"

												The controls can be tough to get the hang of for both mouse/keyboard and 360 gamepad, but once i beat them into submission (or, atleast got used to them), I found this game to be 100% pure joy. Not to be taken even remotely seriously, RO gives us an old-fashined throwback shooter with some really nice updated visuals and a completely goofy scenario (complete with mustache-twirling bad guys and apple pie-loving good guys) which to wreak  wanton unholy vehicular destruction. Bonus points for the aerial missions that bear more than just a passing resemblance to the old classic Desert/Nuclear Strike games.			"

Not a serious game for me but more like a quick haha get in and get out type game. Not something I'm going to spend countless hours on. I would have payed $5 for this cause it is fun. I used m Xbox 360 controll for it and it was working good. Will continue to play it on and off for kicks and giggles.			"

												Pretty fun IF YOU HAVE A CONTROLLERHilarious reviewsMajority of the bad reviews are from people who suck at the game or don't have a controller (Plus one guy who accidentally clicked No)I haven't tried playing the game without the controller. because its sort of neccessary for the kind of movement you need in this gameIts called ""Twin stick shooter"" for a reasonPlus tons of fun watching the score number go up, and exploding your enemies with a Railgun.

												The Good: Excellent visuals, great controls with lots of action, nice variety of challenging enemies, fun four player co-opThe Bad: Gets repetitive quick, can be very hard, levels are too long, can only equip four upgrades, very short with only 7 levelsTwin stick shooters are running amok on mobile devices, but the best tend to be on consoles. Renegade Ops lets you choose from a variety of characters with a special weapon each. You can level up and unlock new upgrades while trying to mow down as many enemies to rack up a high score. The story is actually really cliché and stupid with a commando leader named Bryant trying to stop the evil Inferno from taking over the world. The cut scenes are drawn in nice comic book style stills, but the dialog is as cheesy as it can get. No matter how you try to kill Inferno he always seems to survive and it's just one of those ""You'll never kill me Bryant! MWAHAHA!"" type stories.Besides the cheesy story the action is really fun with some great graphics and physics. You drive around your vehicle using the right stick to shoot with your machine gun. Along the way you can get pick-ups to make your machine gun stronger as well as secondary ammo pick-ups like rocket launchers, rail guns, and flamethrowers. There aren't many pick-ups which is a real bummer, but this is just the start of what else there isn't much of. The enemy variety is interesting with varying degrees of difficulty, but it leads to the game being very difficult most of the time. You start off with 5 lives per level and if you lose them all its game over. The levels are very long and you will be infuriated if you have to go through all that effort again.My main concern about the game is that it gets very repetitive very quickly because all you do is drive around and shoot. The graphics are excellent so you could get some cinematic scripted scenes going, but instead you just follow an objective arrow around all over the place and kill everything in front of you. There are secondary objectives that lead to achievements, but they span the entire level and take way to long to complete. You are also timed on primary objective so if you don't get it done fast enough a 3 minute timer ticks down and if you don't complete it by then it's game over. This means you have to abandon the secondary and makes things just more frustrating. When you die you lose your machine gun pick-ups so you start with the weakest form and can die easier that way because it takes longer to kill enemies.There is a lot of fun to be had here with destructible environments, and four player co-op which makes the game easier and more fun. The upgrades are disappointing because you can only equip four at a time and this leaves a lot of useful upgrades unused. There are only 7 missions so you will beat the game in less than 5 hours, but most people probably won't go through again due to the difficulty and repetitive nature of the whole game. Twin stick shooters should pick this up and rejoice, but don't expect it to change the genre.~Score: 8/10			"

												A mostly-competent twinstick shooter with objective-based gameplay, marred somewhat by the now-common arbitrary limitation of ""You want to use controller? Xbox 4 lyfe, mofo"", an annoying tendency for the screensaver to kick in during gameplay, and an aggressively-sharp difficulty curve.			"

												A ton of fun. Had a huge grin on my face while playing it. The physics are great, the gameplay is great, there's upgrade trees and it's incredibly satisfying to blow everything in sight up. Unlike other games in this genre, you're no invincible and actually have to watch out how you tackle different enemies or you'll be blown to bts in no time. It's almost worth the full price, but I advise you to only buy it when it's on sale. I rate 5/5.			"

												Renegade Ops is one of those games you want to play when you got enough from complex mechanics and stories and simply want to have fun – this basically is a blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up simulator.StoryThe whole story about a mad pyromaniac who wants to destroy the world, while you’re part of a squad which takes things in their own hands cause the governments are incompetent, is a pretty clear homage to some of the simple 80s + 90s action movies. Avalanche Studios themselves also have a reputation for over-the-top games – those guys developed the Just Cause series after all.Honestly…there’s not much more worth to mention about the story: You follow the evil Inferno over the globe to sabotage all his plans and secret facilities. This mostly involves driving around and blowing stuff up – the plot is purposefully silly and simply works to give you a reason why exactly everything around you is exploding. In between missions you get comic-style cut-scenes which tell you what’s going on.GameplaySo let’s get to the main and most important part of the game: the shooting! Equipped with a machine gun which gets stronger by collecting the blue weapon power-ups, you mow through groups of enemy infantry as well as all kinds of vehicles. For tougher enemies like tanks or the rare bosses you have a stronger secondary weapon: either rockets, a railgun or a flamethrower – in contrast to your main weapon, however, their ammo is limited and has to be replenished by collecting the red power-ups.At your disposal stand a total of 5 vehicles (or rather: characters, which use different vehicles; you can even play as Gordon Freeman) which differ only in looks and special ability – they’re all equipped with a MG and can choose between the three special weapons. The mentioned abilities are for example a short time of invulnerability or an airstrike on nearby enemies; those can be quite handy in some situations. By leveling up your current character you unlock a couple of upgrades which for example increase your health, boost your special ability or let you start a level with one of the special weapons already equipped.Sometimes the game also gives you a helicopter to control which, however, can’t be upgraded and is only used a few times in the whole game – usually you’re controlling your car, only.Your main objective in pretty much every mission is: drive to a certain place on the map and destroy everything there (and on the way, ofc) – pretty straight-forward if you will. From time to time the game gives you (optional) side-objectives like freeing prisoners (by shooting at their cages) or collecting relics (by first shooting the boxes they’re in) – you see, great quest design here. These side-objectives usually only give you additional high-score points and rarely serve any other purpose. The only times you need to employ something like strategy is when facing for example tanks which have a weak spot at the rear that can be exploited by circling around the vehicle OR of course in one of the few boss-fights. Though usually avoiding to get hit and simply holding down the left mouse button solves most problems – blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up is the main theme of the game after all.Technical sideAs you can very clearly see by just watching some gameplay (or my video, *wink wink*): Renegade Ops is really great looking. You drive around in varying landscapes (the DLC adds snow maps) with lots of details and partly destructible environment (for example huts, fences n guard towers). Where the game really shines are the visual effects, starting with the dust-clouds while driving and of course ending with the explosions and fire effects caused by you blowing up enemies.The sound effects are doing their part to make you feel pretty badass; the soundtrack and voice actors on the other hand are good, but nothing special. In a couple of reviews here you will read about control issues – and yes, driving with the keyboard can be a little bit unintuitive. You can switch to “tank-controls” in the options which some people prefer – or use a gamepad but then suffer from less precise aiming. However, in my opinion it’s not “completely unplayable” as some people claim: after a few minutes you get used to the controls and shouldn’t have any major problems finishing the game with mouse n keyboard (which I did, and I’m still fine).SummaryWell, Renegade Ops certainly isn’t a very deep game, there’s no great progression system, the story is pretty basic and you don’t have a wide variety of weapons to choose from.But if all this doesn’t bother you and you just want some over-the-top action, this game probably is right up your alley – it’s simply a lot of mindless fun. If alone or in coop with up to three friends you drive around in great looking landscapes and blow stuff up while hearing cool one-liners and fighting an enemy which may be from one of the old James Bond movies: Crazy vehicles, world domination – or rather destruction – and hidden bases on ships and in mountains.For fast and action-packed shootouts and highscore hunts, you should definitely pick-up Renegade Ops and enjoy the chaos.Check out my video review:

The gameplay is full of explosions and hilarity.  The graphics are smooth and very pretty.  Each of your characters slowly levels up to unlock better abilities.And there's co-op.

												Hard for me to decide if I should thumbs up or down....  The DOWNS and UPs are honestly EXTREME and Fantastic in seriousness, which echoes the game itself.... let me explain.Ups:  RIDICULOUS ACTION! with RIDICULOUS CHARACTERS!  This game probably inspired Bro Force!   I mean seriously, this game has GORDAN FREEMAN in it!  That is how over the top awesome this game is!   Action is fast paced, slow paced, really on how you are playing. I'm very very fast, which sometimes causes me issues and I jump off cliffs, but likewise sometimes I discover absurd short cuts for it....   Game will hold your hand enough to keep you progressing if you want to be brain dead and play an action game! But not to the point of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥people like me off. The REAL GOLD though.... MULTIPLAYER especially with friends!   Granted, play as a team and share power ups dangit! (Easy with friends! See?)   and the game takes on another level of FRIGGIN AWESOMENESS! This has been one of my favorite multiplayer games EVER! (and I was gaming before the NES!)BAD:     Yeah there is a bit.... a few cheap shots that weren't needed.... some areas not designed for you to ride around and be bad♥♥♥♥♥in some levels... in a couple parts, TOO MUCH SO. >_<    The game was MEANT for you to ride around and be badass! So it frustrates you when you can't. Solo play wasn't really fun when compared to multiplayer!The BIGGEST ISSUE though by far.... not even levels, and the levels didn't change pace enough. FOr example, first level, when you get the chopper, it was too short lived. Great idea, poorly executed there. OVERALL:  I'll rate this game, 4/10 single player, and 7/10 multiplayer.   9/10 short lived multiplayer with FRIENDS! because you'll love being ridiculous. :p			"

												A big plus for the good graphics, the bold arcade action and design concept. Gameplay is well desiged (PC - mose & keyboard) but I would like a lower difficulty setting. If you just want to play for the story and the action and don't aim for epic highscores, its sometimes too hard with the bosses I think. Would be nice to have a noobie option here (maybe without highscore or so...) ;-)			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine  PLEASE NOTE: I recommended this game with some exceptions, overall if the game did not live up to just a tiny expectation, I would not have recommended it at all, so please read the review carefully if you are thinking of buying/playing this game The game is... meh. It's not terrible, nor is it unplayable. Renegade Ops is developed by Avalanche Studios, the same people behind the Just Cause series. You are a team of renegades that try to stop a guy called Inferno from ruining Earth. It's basically like an episode of ThunderbirdsRenegade Ops is an okay game, the graphics are really nice. The music is okay, nothing special. Although the gameplay is fun at first, it can get quite boring after a whileThe gameplay is fun but can get very repetitive. Each mission you have to follow a set of main objectives which are timed, if you don't do them within the limited time, then its game over. As well as secondary side objectives. That's what you do over and over again, mission after mission, just in a different location, and it get can get very boring very quicklyThe controls are terrible for PC, the driving is terrible and the controls are god awful. The cars/trucks you drive skid like nobody's business. The game heavily recommends an XBOX 360 controller and nothing else! The game only supports XBOX 360 controllers and does not support any type of other controllers. I have a Logitech controller, and the game would not recognise it. I tried an XBOX 360 controller emulator but to no success. So, if you don't have a controller or you don't have an XBOX 360 controller, then don't bother getting this gameRenegade Ops is fun at first, but can get boring and repetitive after a while and can put some people off with its terrible controls for PC RECOMMENDED :)  Provided you have a controller or it is in a sale, price drop, giveaway, gift or even given to you as a free game, otherwise...  NOT RECOMMENDED :(  If you don't have a controller or for its full price  "

												WOW! I did not know this game. Nor am I particulary a fan of top-down arcade shooters. I did not pay this game either (got it for free during the Make war not love campaign, together with some other sega games). But it is really fun! Everything can be destroyed, it is very detailed, runs perfectly smooth, controls are good. You don't control a person, but the vehicle (with someone inside), so sometimes you could get stuck somewhere....and the car doesn't go in reverse right away. Other than that, it's pretty much alright!- mean villain: check- jungle: check- beaches: check- enemies on vehicles and on foot: check- badass tanks: check- explosions: SUPERcheckPLUS, you get to drive the buggy from half life, with gordon freeman in it, and summon hordes of antlions!!

												Very fun game, but I only played it, because got it for free due to the Sega Make war Not Love package.All the levels were fun to play, but I would like to have more main weapons, more than just 3 levels of a machine gun. As for the secondary weapons, didn't see much use of the railgun (more often I hit a soldier than the target I wanted to hit and I didn't see it have a penetration effect). All the special skills you get are interesting.The second campaing is very short (only 3 missions, vs 9 in the first one)Only played SP, MP  might have been even more fun.			"

												Inferno is at it again! And you've got to stop him.Drive a number of vehicles through a number of beautifully crafted levels, each littered with both primary as well as secondary objectives. Combine that with tons of explosions, mad twists in the road, unlimited ammo and some special weaponry and you've got Renegade Ops.Overall, an adrenaline filled blast from the past worth playing.(Small sidenote for non-gamepad players; the tank steering option in the settings menu can be useful, for people used to steering like in the GTA series)			"

												The controls can be tough to get the hang of for both mouse/keyboard and 360 gamepad, but once i beat them into submission (or, atleast got used to them), I found this game to be 100% pure joy. Not to be taken even remotely seriously, RO gives us an old-fashined throwback shooter with some really nice updated visuals and a completely goofy scenario (complete with mustache-twirling bad guys and apple pie-loving good guys) which to wreak  wanton unholy vehicular destruction. Bonus points for the aerial missions that bear more than just a passing resemblance to the old classic Desert/Nuclear Strike games.			"

												Hard for me to decide if I should thumbs up or down....  The DOWNS and UPs are honestly EXTREME and Fantastic in seriousness, which echoes the game itself.... let me explain.Ups:  RIDICULOUS ACTION! with RIDICULOUS CHARACTERS!  This game probably inspired Bro Force!   I mean seriously, this game has GORDAN FREEMAN in it!  That is how over the top awesome this game is!   Action is fast paced, slow paced, really on how you are playing. I'm very very fast, which sometimes causes me issues and I jump off cliffs, but likewise sometimes I discover absurd short cuts for it....   Game will hold your hand enough to keep you progressing if you want to be brain dead and play an action game! But not to the point of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥people like me off. The REAL GOLD though.... MULTIPLAYER especially with friends!   Granted, play as a team and share power ups dangit! (Easy with friends! See?)   and the game takes on another level of FRIGGIN AWESOMENESS! This has been one of my favorite multiplayer games EVER! (and I was gaming before the NES!)BAD:     Yeah there is a bit.... a few cheap shots that weren't needed.... some areas not designed for you to ride around and be bad♥♥♥♥♥in some levels... in a couple parts, TOO MUCH SO. >_<    The game was MEANT for you to ride around and be badass! So it frustrates you when you can't. Solo play wasn't really fun when compared to multiplayer!The BIGGEST ISSUE though by far.... not even levels, and the levels didn't change pace enough. FOr example, first level, when you get the chopper, it was too short lived. Great idea, poorly executed there. OVERALL:  I'll rate this game, 4/10 single player, and 7/10 multiplayer.   9/10 short lived multiplayer with FRIENDS! because you'll love being ridiculous. :p			"

												Renegade Ops is one of those games you want to play when you got enough from complex mechanics and stories and simply want to have fun – this basically is a blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up simulator.StoryThe whole story about a mad pyromaniac who wants to destroy the world, while you’re part of a squad which takes things in their own hands cause the governments are incompetent, is a pretty clear homage to some of the simple 80s + 90s action movies. Avalanche Studios themselves also have a reputation for over-the-top games – those guys developed the Just Cause series after all.Honestly…there’s not much more worth to mention about the story: You follow the evil Inferno over the globe to sabotage all his plans and secret facilities. This mostly involves driving around and blowing stuff up – the plot is purposefully silly and simply works to give you a reason why exactly everything around you is exploding. In between missions you get comic-style cut-scenes which tell you what’s going on.GameplaySo let’s get to the main and most important part of the game: the shooting! Equipped with a machine gun which gets stronger by collecting the blue weapon power-ups, you mow through groups of enemy infantry as well as all kinds of vehicles. For tougher enemies like tanks or the rare bosses you have a stronger secondary weapon: either rockets, a railgun or a flamethrower – in contrast to your main weapon, however, their ammo is limited and has to be replenished by collecting the red power-ups.At your disposal stand a total of 5 vehicles (or rather: characters, which use different vehicles; you can even play as Gordon Freeman) which differ only in looks and special ability – they’re all equipped with a MG and can choose between the three special weapons. The mentioned abilities are for example a short time of invulnerability or an airstrike on nearby enemies; those can be quite handy in some situations. By leveling up your current character you unlock a couple of upgrades which for example increase your health, boost your special ability or let you start a level with one of the special weapons already equipped.Sometimes the game also gives you a helicopter to control which, however, can’t be upgraded and is only used a few times in the whole game – usually you’re controlling your car, only.Your main objective in pretty much every mission is: drive to a certain place on the map and destroy everything there (and on the way, ofc) – pretty straight-forward if you will. From time to time the game gives you (optional) side-objectives like freeing prisoners (by shooting at their cages) or collecting relics (by first shooting the boxes they’re in) – you see, great quest design here. These side-objectives usually only give you additional high-score points and rarely serve any other purpose. The only times you need to employ something like strategy is when facing for example tanks which have a weak spot at the rear that can be exploited by circling around the vehicle OR of course in one of the few boss-fights. Though usually avoiding to get hit and simply holding down the left mouse button solves most problems – blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up is the main theme of the game after all.Technical sideAs you can very clearly see by just watching some gameplay (or my video, *wink wink*): Renegade Ops is really great looking. You drive around in varying landscapes (the DLC adds snow maps) with lots of details and partly destructible environment (for example huts, fences n guard towers). Where the game really shines are the visual effects, starting with the dust-clouds while driving and of course ending with the explosions and fire effects caused by you blowing up enemies.The sound effects are doing their part to make you feel pretty badass; the soundtrack and voice actors on the other hand are good, but nothing special. In a couple of reviews here you will read about control issues – and yes, driving with the keyboard can be a little bit unintuitive. You can switch to “tank-controls” in the options which some people prefer – or use a gamepad but then suffer from less precise aiming. However, in my opinion it’s not “completely unplayable” as some people claim: after a few minutes you get used to the controls and shouldn’t have any major problems finishing the game with mouse n keyboard (which I did, and I’m still fine).SummaryWell, Renegade Ops certainly isn’t a very deep game, there’s no great progression system, the story is pretty basic and you don’t have a wide variety of weapons to choose from.But if all this doesn’t bother you and you just want some over-the-top action, this game probably is right up your alley – it’s simply a lot of mindless fun. If alone or in coop with up to three friends you drive around in great looking landscapes and blow stuff up while hearing cool one-liners and fighting an enemy which may be from one of the old James Bond movies: Crazy vehicles, world domination – or rather destruction – and hidden bases on ships and in mountains.For fast and action-packed shootouts and highscore hunts, you should definitely pick-up Renegade Ops and enjoy the chaos.Check out my video review:

												Avalanche isn't just good at making good open world games (Just Cause/Mad Max). Renegade Ops is one of the best twin stick SHMUPs I have ever played. The graphics look amazing and the gameplay is incredibly fun. There are many different characters with unique skills to use. Enemies and locals are varied. There is also co-op (tho you don't find any randoms online). The game + DLC took about 6-7 hours to complete, but it was so fun that I don't mind it being short. My only gripes with it are that the optional objectives are not always possible with the time limit for the main objective with just 1 person, and the physics based movement means that you can accidentally fall of cliffs. 360 pad recommended. Also you can play as Gordan Freeman and use antlions			"

												This challenging vehicle combat shooter from top down 3d perspective (wow, it's alot) is a fantastic game that has put Avalance Studios on my radar.The combat, the minimal campy story, the progression: everything here is simple yet satisfying, even the DLCs!This game is very hard, but if you play it on normal or above you'll get experience points that work along with the score to improve the curious abilities each character has, and all get better with improvements in uncomplicated upgrade scheme/tree. A timer will force you to play fast, maybe to fast for the game's good, but you can adapt if you persist. And the minimap could have been done better, but at least the pointers work well enough.Even if you die you'll progress, Yep, you'll die a lot. Thank god it has a tank control setting, I can't seem to drive with 3d controls. Playing it with mouse and keyboard now, wich makes driving harder, but shooting more precise. If you liked shadowgrounds or Nuclear Throne this is a cool title to try.			"

												The Good: Excellent visuals, great controls with lots of action, nice variety of challenging enemies, fun four player co-opThe Bad: Gets repetitive quick, can be very hard, levels are too long, can only equip four upgrades, very short with only 7 levelsTwin stick shooters are running amok on mobile devices, but the best tend to be on consoles. Renegade Ops lets you choose from a variety of characters with a special weapon each. You can level up and unlock new upgrades while trying to mow down as many enemies to rack up a high score. The story is actually really cliché and stupid with a commando leader named Bryant trying to stop the evil Inferno from taking over the world. The cut scenes are drawn in nice comic book style stills, but the dialog is as cheesy as it can get. No matter how you try to kill Inferno he always seems to survive and it's just one of those ""You'll never kill me Bryant! MWAHAHA!"" type stories.Besides the cheesy story the action is really fun with some great graphics and physics. You drive around your vehicle using the right stick to shoot with your machine gun. Along the way you can get pick-ups to make your machine gun stronger as well as secondary ammo pick-ups like rocket launchers, rail guns, and flamethrowers. There aren't many pick-ups which is a real bummer, but this is just the start of what else there isn't much of. The enemy variety is interesting with varying degrees of difficulty, but it leads to the game being very difficult most of the time. You start off with 5 lives per level and if you lose them all its game over. The levels are very long and you will be infuriated if you have to go through all that effort again.My main concern about the game is that it gets very repetitive very quickly because all you do is drive around and shoot. The graphics are excellent so you could get some cinematic scripted scenes going, but instead you just follow an objective arrow around all over the place and kill everything in front of you. There are secondary objectives that lead to achievements, but they span the entire level and take way to long to complete. You are also timed on primary objective so if you don't get it done fast enough a 3 minute timer ticks down and if you don't complete it by then it's game over. This means you have to abandon the secondary and makes things just more frustrating. When you die you lose your machine gun pick-ups so you start with the weakest form and can die easier that way because it takes longer to kill enemies.There is a lot of fun to be had here with destructible environments, and four player co-op which makes the game easier and more fun. The upgrades are disappointing because you can only equip four at a time and this leaves a lot of useful upgrades unused. There are only 7 missions so you will beat the game in less than 5 hours, but most people probably won't go through again due to the difficulty and repetitive nature of the whole game. Twin stick shooters should pick this up and rejoice, but don't expect it to change the genre.~Score: 8/10			"

Level progression system to unlock abilities for your vehicle along with per-level progression make the game feel balanced. Lots of charterers  to use add to replay value.			"

A relatively short and incredibly arcadey fun vehicular top down twin stick shooter.Since the game is by the same folks who made the Just Cause series the cheese in its extremely simplistic story is ever so present and adds to that with its very comic book style cutscenes and dialogue. One thing that gripes me though is that the ""cutscenes"" in the game where the game just stops for dialogue aren't skippable at all. Luckily there weren't enough for me there to be discouraged to replay.The sound in-game is a little underwhelming where the noises from the explosions, vehicles, and gunfire are pretty a bit too ""equal"" in volume and don't quite entirely sound like they show off much of an impact.The game doesn't take very long to finish and it may perhaps be faster too with other people but I wouldn't know about that part because the multiplayer is pretty dead and I don't know anyone I'd play this with.It was a bit surprising to find that I was controlling vehicles and not people. It took a little while to learn how to properly handle the vehicles I was using, especially when making turns, but it didn't take very long to get a feel for it. Personally I find that performing seemingly skillful fast & smooth drifts and turns to avoid oncoming rockets and mortars and whatever the like whilst simultaneously shooting the enemy is the most satisfying part about this game. Though the game will always say ""a controller is preferred"" or whatever when starting the game up I think it all just comes down to preference with this game since they both work. Playing with a controller makes driving a lot more smoother and satisfying however your aim in shooting is merely reliant on where the right thumbstick is pointed. On a keyboard & mouse there's a little bet less control when driving but aiming to fire should be significantly more precise thanks to the crosshair you move around with the mouse.You get a choice of some characters with pre-selected vehicles to use before any mission. Everyone uses the exact same standard machine gun that can be upgraded to a maximum of 4 (or 3 I wasn't counting) that can be fired simultaneously. Along the way you'll also acquire other secondary weapons such as the flamethrower, rocket launcher, and rail gun that can be dropped from the bigger enemies for you to pick up & use. All machine gun upgrades and pick-ups are kept for the current mission or until you die. Each character I think controls the same though they have their own ""special"" weapon/abilities for your preference that can be activated with the press of a key/button. Each character may also level up upon use which then rewards you with a sort of ""upgrade points"" which are used to purchase a selection of upgrades currently available. You earn EXP for leveling by simply destroying hostiles though the more you combo up your kills the faster you level and even if you fail the current mission you keep your current levels and EXP. As you keep purchasing upgrades you'll be able to purchase more newer and possibly better ones. Unfortunately the number of upgrades you are able to equip is incredibly limited even at max level. You first start out only being able to equip one but as you level up the character you unlock more slots with the maximum being 4. Though the challenge and encouragement of the extremely minimal strategy when it comes to choosing is nice it seems a bit odd for the game to present you with all of those nice boosters only to let you use such a low amount per mission. And you're only allowed to equip & unequip upgrades when choosing a character.There are 9 main missions in all with maps sometimes being very linear and others being a little more open. Almost each mission contains one optional ""secondary objective"" that are merely there to give you a bigger high score and/or achievements for completing them. Plenty of these you don't really pay much attention to as you finish them along the way in the more linear maps however there are a few that have you driving off around the map a bit but again they're optional. The primary objectives are simple and bluntly pointed out via the dialogue and a waypoint indicator thing for the most part. If you plan on roaming the map a bit for those secondary objectives you'd have to be weary of the three-minute timer that will eventually set if you take too long not completing the current primary objective. If you can get through each mission without getting a game over they go somewhat fast.The difficulty settings range from Easy, Normal, to Hardcore. The game being arcadey as it is, it uses a lives system which I think works well here as it adds a bit more tension to the possible challenges it sets, at least in Hardcore mode where you take crazier damage and you only have 3 lives and wasting them all means you'd have to start the entire mission all over again. Easy mode gives you an unlimited amount of lives and the only thing you'd have to worry about in this setting is the timer that would eventually come. Normal gives 5 lives.It's a simple game with simple objectives and simple ways of getting through them where it's all done pretty alright.			"

												Twinstick shooter that is in a word: fun. A second word: difficult. The controls require some skill to get a handle on the physics, but this adds to the expereince rather than takes away from. Pick a vehicle with the perk to suit your style and head out for some top-down mayhem. It's an arcade style shooter, so there is no saving your progress through levels. Once you clear a level, you can thereafter choose to revisit it, but not until.The one negative: the price. I can't say this game earns full price, maybe not even half. Recommending only at a deep discount. "

												Hard for me to decide if I should thumbs up or down....  The DOWNS and UPs are honestly EXTREME and Fantastic in seriousness, which echoes the game itself.... let me explain.Ups:  RIDICULOUS ACTION! with RIDICULOUS CHARACTERS!  This game probably inspired Bro Force!   I mean seriously, this game has GORDAN FREEMAN in it!  That is how over the top awesome this game is!   Action is fast paced, slow paced, really on how you are playing. I'm very very fast, which sometimes causes me issues and I jump off cliffs, but likewise sometimes I discover absurd short cuts for it....   Game will hold your hand enough to keep you progressing if you want to be brain dead and play an action game! But not to the point of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥people like me off. The REAL GOLD though.... MULTIPLAYER especially with friends!   Granted, play as a team and share power ups dangit! (Easy with friends! See?)   and the game takes on another level of FRIGGIN AWESOMENESS! This has been one of my favorite multiplayer games EVER! (and I was gaming before the NES!)BAD:     Yeah there is a bit.... a few cheap shots that weren't needed.... some areas not designed for you to ride around and be bad♥♥♥♥♥in some levels... in a couple parts, TOO MUCH SO. >_<    The game was MEANT for you to ride around and be badass! So it frustrates you when you can't. Solo play wasn't really fun when compared to multiplayer!The BIGGEST ISSUE though by far.... not even levels, and the levels didn't change pace enough. FOr example, first level, when you get the chopper, it was too short lived. Great idea, poorly executed there. OVERALL:  I'll rate this game, 4/10 single player, and 7/10 multiplayer.   9/10 short lived multiplayer with FRIENDS! because you'll love being ridiculous. :p			"

												An amazing twin-stick shooter with cars and guns.It's like one of those cheesy but unforgettable and great 90s action movies, but in game form.The enemies are well thought-out and appropriately brutal and need you to be able to think on the fly, and the different vehicles you can play with add many ways to play the game and play with other people.The power-ups are fun, where you have simple healing items, then you have three secondary weapons that each add a unique spin on the way you currently play, and then you have upgrades to your primary weapons. There is a minor issue of these becoming competitive, but careful teamwork and coordination avoids this.The environments are very colourful and rich, and very well-crafted.My one issue would be that dynamic split screen, while excellent and very good for local co-op with a buddy, does have a pretty bad and disorienting issue when player 1 dies.I could discuss it more, but I might be doing the game a disservice. It's a great twin-stick shooter with a twist of cars with an extremely fun plot element to it.			"

												Great game to play with friends, bit short though!Sometimes you just wanna drive around and shoot stuff with your friends and ignore objectives but the game doesn't let you, it gives you a time limit to get to objectives making the game feel even shorter!At some point something spoilery happens and me and my friend started driving around yelling ""whooo renegade ops don't answer to no one, whoo!"" we started shooting random houses, destroying cars etc, to which my friend replied ""we've become self aware whoo"" and for some reason the thought of the renegade ops having no will of their own made me laugh, a lot, i couldn't stop laughing! Then he started laughing which made me laugh more, unfortunately at the time i had JUST had dinner and became surprisingly close to throwing up (but didn't), do yourself a favor and play this with your best friend.

												Renegade Ops is a fun twin-stick shooter. Not out of this world spectacular but fun...+ Arcade style gameplay (points, combos, and shooting anything that moves)+ Nice visuals with tons of explosions+ Multiple characters to play as. Each with their own vehicles, special abilities, and skill trees+ Gordan Freeman + Antlions- Story is meh (but what do you expect)- Controller required (keyboard controls are not smooth at all!)- Repetitive (but that's the nature of an arcade style shoot 'em up)7/10If this is your genre, check it out. Not sure about that $15.00 price tag though. I received this game for free from SEGA. "

												This is so much a fantastic game!!! If you go through the first 5 or 6 hours of familiaring with manuvers especially a good harmony of driving and shooting, then it is bloody awesome!!! And this game requires a focus attention. A single slip may lead to game over. So to this extent it is kind of a hardcore game.Each character is interesting and has its specialty. And the plot is a tradionally tough style story which is good. It makes players focus on the gameplay itself.What a pity there are not many players online these days...			"

												Basically a playable b-movie from the Avalanche Studios. In the best twin-stick style you shoot with heavily-armed jeeps and buggies through your opponents. Story is trash pure, plus a motivating vehicle leveling for the 4 characters, as well as a co-op mode.Pro-tip, for those who play the thing without a controller: in the settings, switch the controls to ""Tank Steering"". Controls gonna be smooth af.DLC Addition: ""Coldstrike"" offers a new campaign with fresh opponents, while the ""Reinforcement Pack"" adds two new DLC heroes. For completionists and lovers of the main game maybe not that uninteresting.			"
