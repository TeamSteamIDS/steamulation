												The third part of the Alien Breed series, starting this third part will give a big Déjà vu of the second part. The intro and start-screen are pretty much the same but instead of green they used a orange/yellow theme. After a quick Google search i came to the conclusion that this part was released a little less than two month's after part 2.As stated before the intro and start menu look exactly the same as part 2, after starting a new single player you get to see the re-cap of what happened. Again this looks actually like part 2, even the first minute was the same as the previous part. After the cut-scene you get to start and it again looks actually like A.B 2, i am not stating this is a good or bad thing but since i didn't like the previous part this just didn't work for me.Level design is done with a great eye for details, allot of scenic sightseeing helps to enhance the orbital atmosphere. The in-game cut-scenes are i bit short in my opinion, since they look decent and some of the character designs are to be called quite unique i would like to see them for longer than 5 seconds... The HUD's change of colour works better since it's easy to see no matter whats in the background. The music is still pretty good but after playing five minutes i noticed that they cut the alien ambient sounds. Objectives in the main campaign are mainly going from A to B and activating a switch to proceed in the level and some backtracking.Controls are still mainly for the twin-sticks and using a keyboard/mouse feels awkward and still has some issues with turning around to shoot an enemy that is hitting you in the back. The multiplayer/coop aspect and survivor-mode are still the same as part 2, the overall gameplay is nice but not my thing. Also instead of tuning the game after A.B 2 they kept everything the same, this could again be a good/bad thing but they could of optimize the keyboard controls.			"

												First of all, I end up recommending this/these game/games but my overall score regarding this trilogy is barely 6/10 and I'd like to share my view about this.Alien Breed: Impact - The graphic looks neat despite the age, the controls are a little clunky and the explosions shockwave, more than being realistic, just give you nausea after some time. I swear, the camera shakes all the time non-stop. Still, the levels are smart-structured and the weapons/weapons effects are very cool. The story begins to unfold here and it's quite interesting, so when the game ends, you fnd yourself wanting more because you really want to know what's next.Alien Breed: Assault - By far the worst of the three chapters imho, the levels are just huge for nothing, you always end up running in small hallways or from a room to another, in quick sequence. The secrets/logs aren't really that secret so the exploration part of the game is also limited compared to the previous chapter. Talking about difficulty and all, there's no reason not to play on Elite from the start, all you need to do is always have an automatic door between you and the enemies, since they will just stand there for a few seconds getting hit to death... or you can simply run past them. This is a huge problem shared in all the Alien Breed games, but in this chapter it's more of an issue because despite the levels being huge, you always end up running through small places (making your life easier or miserable depending of the situation). Story-wise you won't be that much satisfied but I guess they wanted to leave the better stuff for the final chapter. Alien Breed: Descend - Imho the best of three, even with all the flaws of the previous chapters, it has some increased pace that in gauntlet-games like these is a must-have. The weapons at your disposal are better than the second chapter and more similar to the first. For the first time here, even tho the logs are still very easy to find, the secrets are not, you may have an easy time with one or two, but you're gonna experience hell to find a couple, and not always you can spend your time looking for them (there are a lot of events with a timer on, so no easy backtracking). The story kicks in to his final stages and before you realize you're on the last mission the games ends with a brutal end-game fight.Now, talking about stuff shared between the three games, I have to say I really hated the camera and overall the stiff controls, they could've done a better job, sometimes you're forced to proceed with a fixed camera and it's really annoying.The story isn't that original but it's cool enough, it only lacks a couple of secondary characters, since you're always on your own or talking to MIA (the AI android) more or less.The biggest blackdot in these games is the lack of Local Co-Op, it'd have been that much better with this option... also, if you're an achievement-hunter, you're gonna experience hell to do the last achievements in multiplayer, problem being there are not enough players online (or none at all) still playing this trilogy, so you will probably need to find someone on the forums and ask for help.As I said previously, overall my vote is 6/10, I recommend you to buy the trilogy on a super special discount or in a bundle (better) like a I did, since imho they're not worthy the full price (or even half the price tbh).

												Alien Breed is an isometric sci-fi shooter where you independently control the direction your character aims and moves. You maneuver through a series of 5 stages in each episode, collecting weapons and items, and shooting aliens as they appear while you move from objective to objective provided on your mini-map.It is difficult to write a separate review for each Episode, as they all largely play the same - you move from point A to point B to pick up access code C to open door D to get to point E to get access code F to.....you get the picture. Lots of backtracking through same-looking corridors, fighting similar looking enemies which pop out of the floor and walls.It's fun, but only moderately so - I would NOT recommend playing through a single episode in one sitting, let alone all three episodes. The gameplay is repetitive and it's the sort of thing you'll want to put down for a while between sessions (I'd actually say on the level of months between episodes) so it doesn't get stale.I will note that the third episode is easily the most difficult of the three, so if you're looking for a challenge, this one is probably the one to look at.

												The first Alien Breed was a fun but very limited twin stick top down shooter. Repetitive, overstretched and lacking in variety. Each successive game has remedied these faults and aimed for a bigger, grander experience.Part two was great, Part 3 is even better. I'm going to assume that if you're looking for a review of 3 that you're familiar with the others, as each parts story directly continues on from the previous game. Its not a trilogy as such, but one story broken into three acts.If you hated the first two then I doubt you'll get any more enjoyment from this one. If you liked Part 1 (which wasn't great) and enjoyed Part 2 (which was great) then tuck in - Part 3 is excellent. More action, more variety through setpieces, same chunky and brutal combat.			"

												A solid Twin Stick Shooter.If you want to mow things down with no ethical quandry, this is a good game series. I had fun all the way through. It doesn't do anything unique or ground breaking, but it's solid for what it is. The game has a good number of weapons, each good in different situations. Flame thrower is fun.I think one of my few complaints about this game series is a minor preference thing. There's 3 different upgrades for each weapon but you can only choose ONE. If you upgrade to another you will only be using the new one, not both. Just a money saving tip.			"

												Team17, the developer best known for the creation of ""Worms"" and other such classics are the ones responsible for bringing us the subject of my next review, a lesser-known title but a particularly lustrous gem nonetheless.The Alien Breed Trilogy is a series of third-person shooters. Like their more popular distant cousins the FPS, they too automatically come with an 'action' tag by association because that's what we all (myself included) have come to expect from the genre. Though categorized as such, the three I'm going to talk about today could more accurately be described as atmospheric, survival games wearing Sci-Fi party hats.I want to go ahead and say that although this series consists of three games, the way it was designed makes it difficult and more or less redundant to write three separate reviews. In light of that, I'm going to combine my thoughts on the entire trilogy into one segment for better flow and understanding of their connectivity as a whole.Alien Breed: Impact is the first installment, our introduction to the series and it makes a stellar first impression. Like many others, I too was surprised that Team17 essentially removed the previously aforementioned 'action' tag and tossed it out the window but that's not a bad thing by any stretch of the imagination.The game starts off with the protagonist - an engineer named Conrad- aboard a ship that inadvertently crashes into another, much larger vessel and must hurry to find a solution. The player must make their way across the ship guided by an NPC, uncovering clues from crew log entries as to the sinister reality of their increasingly perilous situation. In spite of the fact that you aren't tearing down the hallways, guns blazing, there are sections that are faster paced and demand a little more of that action, first-person shooter experience, especially if you choose to play on ""Elite"" difficulty.An interesting thing to note about the plot for Alien Breed is that the narrative progresses through a series of comic book styled panels and dialogue after certain sections or checkpoints. Just so you're not left hanging around on an idle screen reading while the gameplay drops off, there is voice acting to accompany the cut scenes as well as atmospheric ambient noise to maintain the energy and illusion of imminent danger.The tracks throughout each game are amazing and can get pretty intense at times but for the most part, you will be bombarded by the crackling of electricity, creaks, groans, and explosions of a dilapidated ship that's falling apart around the player as you scramble to escape. Not to mention the hordes of chittering aliens that attack at every opportunity. Together with graphics that set the mood with dark overtones, the flickering lighting, constant fires and mechanical problems all come together and mesh quite well, eliciting a feeling of suspenseful anticipation. You can't help but get pulled in and become invested in the well-being of that unfortunate individual who you completely forgot was a 3-D rendered model on your computer screen. Wait, was that just me?! Anyway, moving on...The same aesthetics, character development and everything else that was so endearing are carried over to the rest of the trilogy. In Alien Breed: Assault, the story moves from the protagonist's own battered ship the ""Leopold"" whose engines are damaged beyond repair, to that of the ghost ship he and the rest of the crew smashed into by some ill stroke of providence. Your goal now is to handle the alien threat, dodge the ghost ship's defenses that happen to be programmed to attack any and all indications of a human presence while all the time hoping that you can salvage enough of their systems to get the rig up and running again.I wanted to enjoy the sequel as much as I did the first game and in a way, I still did. There were just so many glaring performance issues that made the game borderline unplayable and actually was for a lot of people based on the comments I've seen. Only through sheer determination and my own 'finishist' attitude did I ever manage to complete it.Given how good the first game was and that the studio basically followed the same winning formula, my only conclusion is that the entire team must have suffered a mass stroke during development of the second installment.Suffering from multiple crashes per session and such intense lag at times means that you're at the mercy of whatever might stumble into your path during one of Alien Breed 2's fits. As if that wasn't enraging enough or you weren't frustrated to the point of throwing your hands up and moving on to something a little more stable, there were also a few game-breaking glitches that would come along and push you over the edge. One such glitch would cause you to phase through inanimate objects such as floor grating and even locked doorways, so if saving your game often hasn't become a habit at this point then you will no doubt end up throwing a fit of your own after restarting whole sections over and over again. Unlike its predecessor, Assault is horribly optimized and could surely have benefited from much more thorough quality assurance before its release.Now, you might be wondering what the final chapter in the trilogy could be like if the second part was such a disaster and so widely panned by its player-base. Did the studio continue their downward spiral with the franchise? It's a pleasure to report that no, they did not.The story picks up with the descent of the two conjoined ships into the atmosphere of a nearby planet. You race against the clock to stop the malevolent force behind everything that's happened while it becomes increasingly obvious that Conrad isn't going to make it out alive.While Alien Breed: Descent returns to the glory of the original with its smooth controls and solid frame rate I can't say that the series has fully recovered, not 100% anyway. Maybe 95%, that's a comfortable number. My reason for this is that there were some minor bugs that still popped up from time to time, but nothing serious enough to bring on any of the rage-induced episodes present during part two. User experience will undoubtedly vary but for me, there was only one such instance where I got stuck inside a railing while cautiously creeping along a catwalk to peer inside an open doorway. Needless to say that I ended up getting rushed by a dozen enemies that apparently took issue with the fact that I was not a pile of blood, guts, and assorted entrails. Curious, I even attempted to recreate the situation several times, in the exact same spot (and others) and was unsuccessful in doing so. This allowed me to finish the final game on a positive note, a much less volatile demeanor and with fond memories of this sci-fi trilogy, although I remain reluctant to play it again anytime soon.It took me a while to finish this series because of the traumatic ordeal suffered at the hands of Alien Breed: Assault but I have to say that the franchise and the studio are well on their way to earning back my trust.Separately, each game is shorter than the previous, ranging from roughly twenty hours to complete the first chapter with that number dwindling all the way down to seven hours to finish Descent. That's not a problem, though, because often times shorter games are much better than those that drag themselves out for the sake of extra playtime. Alien Breed doesn't do that because it doesn't have to. It knows full well what it's trying to be and executes in flawlessly. If it wasn't for the problematic sequel, this series would easily make it on my list of favorites.			"

												Repetitive, no real new elements apart water everywhere, Alien Breed 3: Descent doesn't manage to get as good as the others, as you're always seeing the same rooms over and over. But the end of the first chapter, the fact that you find Vance and Barnes, how to say it,... or Klein's body make the story good.In other words, Descent is concluding the trilogy, still in the same ship as the previous game but with a reason for you to fight. Your friend MIA is prisoner. People around you are dead. No one is surviving apart you.This game is very very similar to the two previous ones, so, well, I'll copy/paste parts of them.The solo campaign is about the main character but you can play three co-op missions as Vance and Barnes with a friend.The game is seen in 3D isometric, meaning that you have a little time to adapt to the command and the view when you're used to 3rd person or 1st person game.I've enjoyed this game but less than the others: the plot turned out to be very sad because his only friend is prisonner and Theo knows that if he wants to stop this madness, some sacrifices have to be made. However, given the fact that no novelty is there, apart another new weapon, this game is on the verge to be a boring one.You still have the PDA - with finding those of the crew ship, without forgetting the maps and the terminals that are shops and save points.The HUD is orange, like the title in the header. So, everything (texts on the screen) will be orange too. The game is also told with cutscenes drawed as comics. And well, orange is also the main color. Impact had blue, Assault had green, Descent will have orange, kinda indicating that we're going down into the fire.Alien Breed: Descent is still a nice game. Don't worry, it will conclude perfectly the trilogy. That was a nice ride, don't hesitate.			"

												Alien Breed comes in ""3 Episodes"" and if you like games like the Free2Play game Alien Swarm then you should try all three Episodes of Alien Breed. That would Be:Alien Breed: ImpactAlien Breed: AssaultAlien Breed: DescentCan recommend. Only flaw i found was the Co-op part of the game, its a stand alone four diffrent missions that you can play, and not the main campaign played in Co-op (Sadly). Later games even have survival mode.

												This is an excellent way to waste a few hours. I was a big fan of the original game and so when this new and updated version came out I was pretty excited. From what I can remember of the 90's game, this seems to be pretty faithful to the original. Pick up a gun, kill aliens. Admittedly some of the mission tasks can be pretty repetitive, and the story.. exists... but thats not what this game is about. With the unreal engine behind it I sometimes felt that this is what XCOM would be if it was just the combat in real time. In any case, I enjoyed myself with this one. 8/100 Comments				"

												Since all three games are exactly the same this is the same review as the other two games.Not a great game but it has great weapons and really good graphics and very smooth gameplay. Why it's not a great game:1: The biggest massive problem, CONSTANT AND NEVER ENDING FOCUS STEALING FROM START TO FINISH. Which really is not that prevalent in the first game but is a major problem in the second and third games. The game constantly, more than any game I have ever seen, even Resident Evil 6, steals focus from you during events to make the camera spin a little while zooming in and force you to watch the stupidest most mundane ♥♥♥♥ like a grate opening or a switch turning on or ANYTHING. It was like the developers found a little focus stealing trick and went way, way, way overboard with it. It is aggravating to astronomical levels and does not feel like you are playing a game but something where you get to play only sometimes when it lets you. Again, not so bad in game one but a massive problem in games two and three.2: CONSTANT screen shaking from explosions. It caused me to have to play each game from start to finish with a non-stop bad headache.3: The sound is very low. I have to turn my volume way way up when playing this game which is a big problem because of course I am not going to remember to turn it back down when I'm done playing so the next thing I do, like play music or play another much better game, blows my ♥♥♥♥ing ears off.4: There are very few types of enemies. I think 5 or less. And even those 5 all feel the same.5: The game is very, very repetitive. What you do in the first fifteen minutes is exactly what you do in every other minute of all three games. The game offers no variety at all, especially since all 3 games are mirror images of each other.6: The environments from the start to finish of all games is all exactly the same from game to game. Even though each game takes place in a different area of the ship or I think on different ships maybe, all three games are completely identical.7: All 3 games are very short, about 4 hours each.8: Crashes/glitches. I don't think I had any trouble with the first two games, maybe one or two crashes in the second game. The third game has crashed three times now. Once early, then half way through it, and now near the end. Their forum pin says it could be a file validation to fix it, but who cares when the games have the other bad problems I pointed out. And YES I understand it is a problem on my end. But no other games crash so it is a problem on my end caused by something to do exclusively with this game in particular and none of the other 150+ games I have installed.It's sad because the games graphics are outstanding and the gameplay is very, very smooth. But because of the main flaws being so incredibly bad, I can only recommend them if you can catch them on sale like I did for $5.65 for all 3 games. Their normal price of $10 each is laughable. Like throw your head back and audibly laugh loud. Once I play through them I'm never coming back to them, ever.Since all 3 games are the exact same, only one score is needed. Production quality in some areas like graphics and control is 8/10, everything else 5/10. Overall, 5/10. Badly missed opportunity for a all-time favorite cult classic. Whoever made this is jarringly inept.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine  PLEASE NOTE: I recommended this game with some exceptions, overall if the game did not live up to just a tiny expectation, I would not have recommended it at all, so please read the review carefully if you are thinking of buying/playing this game Alien Breed 3: Descent is the third and final game in the Alien Breed trilogy developed by Team 17 Digital and is a remake of a very old Amiga game by the same developer. However, Alien Breed 3: Descent and possibly all the Alien Breed trilogy games suffer with some bad choices which ruin the game completelyYou travel between waypoints, press a button or something for a few seconds and then go somewhere else and do almost the same exact same thing. The whole time aliens are trying to kill you and you do this for five levels and then there is a boss fight and then game is overWhile Alien Breed 3: Descent lasts between five to six hours and I must admit I don't even know if I was truly interested in a full hour of the gameplay in total. The multiplayer is completely dead, but if you're not playing with someone I'm not sure if there's much reason to even play this game. The game is just doesn't do anything interesting after a levelThe levels are mostly start to go to point A, get blocked by something, side track to open a door, then go back, then get blocked again and sidetrack again, then come back. It's extremely repetitive, but it's mostly just wave after wave of the same enemiesAlien Breed 3: Descent is a mixed bag and I highly recommend to watch some gameplay videos, download a demo or (although I do not fully endorse it) pirate it and try it out before buying it... RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Alien Breed 3: Descent is not a spectacular game by any means, but it is still worth playing if you have some extra time. The game does a good job at creating intense moments of action and suspense, but beyond that it is simply an average twin stick shooter with a somewhat interesting but predictable story.			"

												The third part of the series finishes the story. After part two I was really eager to see how the story would end up, and got not disappointed.The many aliens got me bored after some time, it's just like ""there's is always one more alien in this room"". You are never alone. Even if you think you killed all those eggs you got always one more. somewhere.The game design hasn't changed much since part 1, just run around and press some buttons, then aliens come, then the path is open. The one thing making me play through this was the storyline, which, as mentioned before, really got me after part 2. Haven't tried the coop yet, and eventually I won't, since I couldn't find a partner. But the singleplayer is definitly worth giving a play through. Especially if you just want to kill aliens, which is pretty much all you do.			"

For more reviews and gameplay videos by Morgoth, check out the profile or the Twitch channel at twitch.tv/morgoth0221So I finally finished the whole trilogy, and after playing through them all, Descent is by far and away the best of the three games.  While the first one was slow, but interesting with a bland boss fight to top it all off, and the second one was a major waste of time with boring written all over it, the third is anything but.  Yes, the game still suffers from the same problems that it's predecessors had, but it is so much better in so many regards.Let's start with what was already good from the previous two titles: the graphics.  And boy are they in full swing on this title.  The game looks truly incredible for this game's budget and development level.  The aliens and environments are slicker than ever with almost no framerate issues throughout the entire game.  The environment, while still not as varied as the original game, still feels alive and vivid as you wander through the dark corridors of this forgotten ghost ship that is tearing through a planet's atmoshpere.  This awesome graphics level also applies to the game's weapons, which is by far the best weapon pool from the three games.  Speaking of the weapons, they finally nailed it with these.  The player still starts with the quintessential assault rifle and pistol (useless), and will still obtain the shotgun and flamethrower (still my favorite).  However, the developers threw out the worthless rocket launcher from the last title and left out (sadly) the hyper blaster as well.  Of course, the last one can be understood as it was pretty much a glorified assault rifle.  In the place of those two weapons you are given the Electro Link Gun (inaccurate but very, very powerful), and the almighty Project X, which functions like the rocket launcher without the incredibly annoying insta-gib if you're standing too close to it when it goes off.As for plot development, there is quite a bit in this game.  It was great to finally see some character development in any form, which was completely absent in the last two titles.  A death near the beginning was touching, but very tragic.  And even later on, if you keep your eyes open, you'll run across two more deaths of people you once knew.  However, the shining star of this game is obviously Klein, the mad scientist behind all of this nightmare.  Klein's voice can be heard throughout almost the entire game as it taunts you consistently with your ineptitude, as well as trying to make you give up on your task of destroying him by tempting you with thoughts and opportunities of immortality.  Conrad, being the almost silent protagonist, quietly declines.Moving on to the enemies of the game, a few old problems start to rear their ugly heads.  Yes, there are quite a varied list of enemies to  vanquish in this title, but not enough variety to sustain another 5 hour trek.  Especially if you played the last two games as well.  There is one new type of enemy in this game though but it shows up rarely, and it's ripped apart just as easily from bullets that you're unlikely to realize it's even there in most fights (save it's shiny blue skin).  The boss fights, however are finally, FINALLY interesting in some degree.  Good lord does this franchise have some crappy boss encounters, but it looks like Team 17 saved all of the half decent ones for the finale.  Although to me, the final boss encounter was not nearly as satisfying as it should have been after trekking through all three games, and it wasn't even the best boss fight of the game.And lastly, a new problem arose a couple times throughout my playthrough.  Glitches.  There were a few areas where Conrad would seemingly get stuck for an unspecified amount of time, only to be knocked out of it randomly by an enemy.  Along with that, I even suffered a few game crashes while reading some of the logs in the game, which of course prompted me to stop reading any logs at all.  Even with these glitches though, this was still the best title in the trilogy by far.

												Same as the previous 2 games, it amazes me why they couldnt realease all 3 games into 1 pack instead of selling them commercially as singles. Any how what ive stated in previous reviews stands only buy it if its on sale since its got pretty much zero replayability and theres just not enough content or oomph to go back to an average experience overall although i did like the final boss and his constant taunting of the main protaganist only because he sounded alot like my old english teacher at school lol :D			"

												Game is an endless series of ""Fetch and Run"" questsHere's everything you need to know about this game:OMG, there's a fire! Quick run back half way across the ship to activate fire suppression (shoot 3 aliens)! OH NO, the panel isn't powered, find the generator and fire it up (shoot 5 aliens, 2 of them really big)! Fire out? Good, lets go all the way back to that first door and find out why we need to backtrack again (Shoot 2 aliens, assorted sizes).Rinse and repeat!			"

												This is the third and the last part of Alien Breed trilogy. And I think it's not the best one, but not the worst. I would say they align like that (from best to worst):Alien Breed 1Alien Breed 3Alien Breed 2The first part is far more superior. I don't know why. Maybe the game was still fresh by then and after the first part you basically did the same thing all over again in the next 2 parts.Anyway. It's a decent trilogy. Some people say that its repetitivness will make you bore of the game, but it's not entirely true. The action of these games are very fun. Fun to shoot the aliens that swarm at you from all directions. Even if you do this hundreds of times during the games.As for Alien Breed 3+more aggressive aliens. They even seemed faster than in the previous parts.+boss fights. Even tho they are quite straight forward, but still good enough.and now annoying things-you will get stuck in some narrow corridors-there are so MANY explosions going on around you. One level was basically an explosion fiesta. And that's not the worst thing, but with every explosion your screen starts to shake and you can hardly see something. Imagine that it lasts for the whole level (~50 minutes). This is just stupidly ridiculous. Very frustrating. I know, the ship is in a bad shape and so on, but why make it shake every few seconds and make the things explode in the exactly same spots over and over again.-camera positioning still sucks sometimes (well, mostly when you can't rotate it)I got this game from the Humble Bundle a few years ago. If you really want to play this game, at least get it when it's on a sale. Otherwise it's not worth ~20€. "

												AB3 is the conclusion of Alien Breed Trilogy where Conrad, combat engineer, continue his adventure, as the real nature of the threat he's facing is finally revealed, and a final showdown is inevitable. It is a third-person shooter with variety of weapons, as well as other items like heal packs, grenades, even an occasional turret you can place to help you defend a spot. However, the ship's terrain is very repetitive, and most of the missions involve running around looking for something, which lead you to look for something else. In AB1, the Leopold, came out of hyperspace and crashed into a giant ship full of nasty critters. Most of the Leopold's crew is dead. Four survivors, 3 human and 1 synth (Android) are all that remained. Conrad tried one thing after another to free the Leopold to no avail, as he fights through critters that infiltrated the ship. A desperate plan is conconcted... Conrad will attempt to cross over in to the other ship in hopes of restarting that instead. in AB2, Conrad made it through, and escorted MIA, the Synth, to attempt to interface with the other ship, only to discover that this ship is not alien at all, but actually an old secret project ""lost in space"", and it's too dangerous to let live. AB2 ended with MIA captured by the alien ship, fate unknown, and Conrad set the ship to self destruct. Without spoiling the entire game, let's just say you'll attempt to rescue MIA, and have a final confrontation with Klein as the ship crashed back into the planet. You will have to make a run on the surface of the ship (where atmosphere is still too thin) and periodically hit oxygen stations, then confront bosses, which are very hard to kill. The game gets VERY repetitive, as you run through corridor after corridor that looks about the same. There are plenty of things to shoot, but it's always in a dark place, and your light doesn't cover that much. Your ""radar"" is good, but enemies move fast, and ammo is not that plentiful.  And mission objectives gets repetitive... You need to disable the ""gyro"" which will kill the generator permanently rather than just disconnected. So you run over, only to find door blocked, so you hunt for alternate route, which is blocked by locked door, so you hunt for a keypass, which then leads to a door blocked, so you have to hunt for access from the other side, and shoot at the explosive barrels to ""release"" the door, then you get to a room that's on fire, so you have to search for damage control station to release halon gas... You get the idea. The entire game is full of Fedex quests like that... Find this, take it there, repeat ad nauseum. The boss fight is definitely reminiscent of Aliens (Ripley on that ""platform"") or at least one part of it. The ending is left ambiguous enough to leave it open for another sequel... if you aren't deathly tired of this one.  All in all, this game concluded the trilogy that felt it's a bit too long. If you can get the whole trilogy cheap, it will provide a couple hours of shooting critters left and right. However, it really needs a boss health meter, as I can never tell how much more do I have to shoot the darn boss (i.e. was I doing any damage). I was stuck on boss encounter 1 because I can't seem to bring down the shields for the final assault. Had to consult a video walkthru to realize what I did wrong.  "

												I think these games have actually gotten worse over the course of the series. To start with, this is Alien Breed 3. THREE. It's the THIRD game in the series, yet it uses the exact same engine as the first, as well as the exact same textures, exact same enemies (with a few additions), exact same guns (with 1 addition), exact same sounds, exact same level design, exact same atmosphere, exact same controls and gameplay mechanics, and exact same fetch quests. While the first one was mediocre, it's inexcusable that they didn't attempt to make ANY minor improvements by the third freakin' game. The entirety of this game is fetch quests. Run here, activate door terminal, but oops power is out, run to power terminal, but oops there's flooding, run to flood control terminal, but oops it's blocked by fire, run to fire terminal, but oops it's blocked by debris. Run and find demolition charges, run back and blow up debris, run back and activate fire terminal, run back and activate flood control terminal, run back and activate power terminal, and finally run back and activate door terminal, all while fighting off tiny clusters of ridiculously weak enemies who serve only to nip at your heels while you try to complete objectives.It is utterly ridiculous, entirely tedious, and completely predictable. Monsters pop out of the floor when you activate a terminal, search a container, or pick up an item (all which require you hold down a button for several seconds), but generally just one or two enemies appear at a time, which does not do anything other than require you to stop searching, kill them, and start searching again. Often multiple times.Monsters are insanely weak, and do not pose anything remotely resembling a challenge. You can complete literally the entire game other than boss fights with the ultra-accurate pistol, which naturally has unlimited ammo. The only time that there is even a hint of a challenge is when the game throws 30 enemies at you at a time from 3 different directions, but even then, it's not challenging so much as annoying. There is literally not a single enemy in the game that you can't kill with the pistol before they get to you, and that is just sad. Is the whole point of the enemies to make it take longer to get to the next boss battle or something?Speaking of boss battles (and slight spoiler here), you are required to ""kill"" the alien queen 7 times. SEVEN. Kill her once, then cutscene, then kill her again, then she escapes. Then on a later level, kill her once, then cutscene, then regular gameplay, then she returns so kill her again, then cutscene, then more regular gameplay, then she returns AGAIN so kill her again, then cutscene. Then on a LATER level, kill her, then cutscene, then kill her AGAIN, and she finally stays dead. If I hadn't been so annoyed, I would have laughed at the ridiculousness. Oh don't worry though, she's never a challenge. Ever. Voice acting is cheesy as ever, which isn't a big deal, but the stupid disembodied cackling from the main antagonist gets INSANELY annoying, and goes on the entire game.To be fair, I did actually manage to make it through this game (unlike the first 2), but that's only because I thought I should beat at least one in the trilogy. Now I wish I had powered through the first one, and never touched 2 or 3. I REALLY wish I'd never bought them in the first place, but whatever.I do not recommend these to anyone. While I understand others may not hate this game as much as I do, the fact is that there are thousands of better games out there far more deserving of your time and money. Some of those better games (ahemALIENSWARMahem) don't even require money.			"

												The third part of the Alien Breed series, starting this third part will give a big Déjà vu of the second part. The intro and start-screen are pretty much the same but instead of green they used a orange/yellow theme. After a quick Google search i came to the conclusion that this part was released a little less than two month's after part 2.First look into the game:As stated before the intro and start menu look exactly the same as part 2, after starting a new single player you get to see the re-cap of what happened. Again this looks actually like part 2, even the first minute was the same as the previous part. After the cut-scene you get to start and it again looks actually like A.B 2, i am not stating this is a good or bad thing but since i didn't like the previous part this just didn't work for me.The game:Level design is done with a great eye for details, allot of scenic sightseeing helps to enhance the orbital atmosphere. The in-game cut-scenes are i bit short in my opinion, since they look decent and some of the character designs are to be called quite unique i would like to see them for longer than 5 seconds... The HUD's change of colour works better since it's easy to see no matter whats in the background. The music is still pretty good but after playing five minutes i noticed that they cut the alien ambient sounds. Objectives in the main campaign are mainly going from A to B and activating a switch to proceed in the level and some backtracking.Verdict:Controls are still mainly for the twin-sticks and using a keyboard/mouse feels awkward and still has some issues with turning around to shoot an enemy that is hitting you in the back. The multiplayer/coop aspect and survivor-mode are still the same as part 2, the overall gameplay is nice but not my thing. Also instead of tuning the game after A.B 2 they kept everything the same, this could again be a good/bad thing but they could of optimize the keyboard controls.This game gets a rating of 6,5, mainly because the game feels like a Déjà vu from the previous part.

												Best of the seires.I have already reviewed the secound game in the series, and the games are very simelar, but I will still say what this game did, that made it my favorite of the three.It`s still a run and gun game, with a overhead view, and it still tryes to be scary but fails.It would be better if you read my Alien Breed: Assult review becosue I will not go into that much detail in this one, since the games are that simelar.Well this is when the game ends, and what an ending! The game picks up from the last, and we know that the ship have taken over the mind of MIA. This is the game with the most highlights and the most bosses. The good thing about the bosees, is that they all are enjoyable and are at times difficult.This puts a new perspective on the game, since the other games in the series, did not had as many memerable moments as this. The game puts our main charecter through hell, and it really makes you tence to kill the last boss, which has a huge twist at the end. And the ending is really really good.The weapons in this game are really awesome towards the end, and it only makes the feeling of blasting aliens even more satisfying. This game get`s a thumps up, becouse I think the whole sereis has been enjoyable, and this ending, made all the games worth it. 5.2 out of 10			"

												This is my second favourite version of Alien Breed, second to the first game in the series.I've spent a lot of time playing this game and all the games in the series.If you are new to the series I would suggest you start with the first game, however, the gameplay IS essentially the same in every version.Pros:-Same old Alien Breed gameplay. If you like it, you will like this version.-New and visually impressive maps and bosses, some new guns.-Good sound effects, graphics, music, and controls.-Multiplayer Co op Maps, multiplayer and singleplayer Survial Maps,  and Steam Leaderboards. Voice Chat and Steam Achievements.Cons:-Same old slow placed repetetive Alien Breed gameplay. Excessive focus stealing from the camera, (zooming in on switches, doors, explosions) and new but cramped and unpleasant camera angles.-Environments are the same old interior of a spaceship, and many corridors and rooms.-Same old sound effects, music, and graphics as the previous versions.-Steam Achievements can be very challenging. No cards. No local co op.I suggest you buy this game despite it's flaws. It's a fun game and online multiplayer adds lots of replay.			"

												Apart from the story and new weapons, it's pretty much the same as the previous two games. ""A nice casual top down shooter if you are into those. If you're not, you won't probably find anything enjoyable here, the game is basicly ""Go there and activate this switch!"", ""Power down, go to the generator room and activate power"" and the storyline is nothing more than the ""usual alien infestation on your ship"". It's a very simple game you might enjoy it or you might not. I personally don't recomend it."" On the other hand I think the developers managed to get some sections where the camera is pretty weird and you can barely aim, if I said that that any of the previous two games were abit fun, this one certainly isn't although if you are into the story, like myself, this one provides an interesting ending. It might be worth the shot if you enjoyed the story on Impact and Assault, otherwise just skip it.			"

												I went into this thinking that I would have a separate section for each installment in this trilogy, but (after putting what I have deemed significant time into each of them) I have decided to lump them all in together as there wasn’t much difference between any of them. That being said, let’s get started shall we?I – Story [2/10]The gist of the story is this: Conrad, the Chief Engineer of the Leopold, are trying to restore power to your ship whilst doing battle with hordes of aliens and contending with a possessed AI. And that, kids, is all she wrote. I realize this is a remake, but honestly? That’s all?II – UI [6/10]In part one of the trilogy (Alien Breed: Impact) the UI (or User Interface for the less savvy among us) was colored blue and was infuriatingly hard to see at almost any given moment. Thankfully, in installments two and three, the color had been changed to green and was infinitely easier on the eyes. The mini-map was rather reliable, making it mostly unnecessary to consult the full map often. Apart from that, HUD was minimal and user friendly.III – Gameplay [1/10]Altogether I found Alien Breed to be underwhelming practically at every turn. The game is played from a top-down angle with rigid and irritating camera controls. The objectives were mind-numbingly repetitive and I found myself getting overly bored about an hour into the first game. I present to you a dramatization of just about every thing you do in these games.“Turn on the cranky thing to put out the fires.”*Kills aliens*“Oh no, the cranky thing is broken. Go reboot six computers to fix the cranky thing.”*Kills aliens*“Good job on rebooting the computers. You can turn on the cranky thing now. Also, here are some more aliens for you to kill.”And that, ladies and gentlemen, is quite seriously the entire game. Sure, you get an odd boss battle here and there, but I’ll be damned if they aren’t just as repetitive and underwhelming as the rest of the game. My other biggest complaint about all the games was the weapon upgrading system. This game is how far into the future and I can only have one upgrade installed on my weapon at a time? What kind of garbage is that? IV – Content [4/10]With this being a trilogy, you’d assume they’d add some new content into each game right? Well, they did, but I had you going there didn’t I? Impact was easily the worst game in the trilogy. The campaign (in all three games, mind you) was downright awful. Part two (Alien Breed: Assault) added in a “Survival Mode” which was mildly entertaining. It was a billion times more fun than the campaign, that’s for sure. The enemies felt uninspired; most of them looked like the bugs from Starship Troopers only fatter and more ludicrous. The weapons were a bit boring as well, though I did particularly enjoy using the flamethrower. (Who doesn’t?)V – Visual [6/10]There isn’t much to say here really. The graphics throughout the trilogy were consistently the same, with varying levels of obnoxious explosions everywhere. I realize the ship is crashing, but come on. That being said, the graphics weren’t too bad and the lighting was good.VI – Audio [4/10]I found the sound effects to be rather lacking. The guns weren’t thrilling in the least and the little, face-hugger-esque aliens, I would swear on my non-existant childrens’ graves’, were frog noises.

												One of the worst sequels i have ever seen. Besides the screen shaking that makes the game nearly unplayable they brough nothing new to the franchise. Same old senseless walking around to push buttons on a huge ship, same way the enemies behave, all looks to me as a pressure to deliver the game and the chouice they made was to deliver the same game with new maps and a nonexistent story.

												I’d be lying if I said that this review would be as negative as the other two games. Now, I may be suffering from Stockholm syndrome from continuously playing all three games in a row, but I find this game more enjoyable than the other two. I may actually even have to recommend it ;__;The opening did not give us much to go off on—a monotonous comic strip will NOT capture the audience’s attention, especially when you’re trying to explain what has happened from Alien Breed 2. That’s my only real issue with the beginning. It seems that Team 17 did try to make a difference with their game. They did stick to the run-to-here-and-back game mechanic through the entirety of the game, but they threw in many more dynamic scenes and gameplay experience as far as ways in which you shoot aliens. Now that they’re raising Klein as your main antagonist, I find it a lot more enjoyable, especially when listening to his stereotypical German accent. <3 Very ‘OK’ boss battles. I actually kind of enjoyed fighting the aliens, especially in the water scenes (which I can also appreciate). They also brought in a new type of alien that while I like, I also dislike. I feel that the Electro-shocker is a bit overpowered, and would have worked better if it could not actively fight on land, since that was what I assumed from the first few that I had encountered. It would have made more sense, because the game shows that electricity will hurt you if it’s spread above water. And ooooh my god, the comic scene for the last chapter is so lovely. SO LOVELY. It’s just so sick and cruel and yet I can’t help but love Klein even more for being such an evil lunatic. I just LOVE it, even though I know I wouldn’t really enjoy his company in real life.  I did not enjoy the ending.Team 17 made this trilogy with the interests of making money only, after seeing interest in their Worms series starting to dwindle. They made and released all three of these games in the same year. A LOT of content was reused in the first two games, but I also see a lot more introduced into this final game. I’m not sure what got them to put in more effort into this last one, but I can say that it is OK. Not BAD, per say, but OK. I’m not sure why this game got as much bad rep as the other two games, but I’d still say get this game when it’s discounted at least 75%, but if you were going to pick any of the three, play this one first.

They did try to change things up this round though, being the last installment. It is a bit shorter than the other two, and they switch up 2 weapons every game (game 2 was my fav with the minigun :D ). They did somehow make this game E VEN EASIER by doing a few different things. Not a bad little story, and even though it's completely predictable the entire way through, and it makes you hate not letting you just finish it by taking an extra 10 minutes to do a run around route haha .... but, alright, wouldn't reccomend though.

												This is the final in the Alien Breed games that I own and again this is like the others, an enjoyable effort from Team17 to create a twin-stick shooter but not my kind of game. Gameplay is the same as the others in the series basic but it works for the game, the story is built up and in depth, and there are good gameplay aspects that come around as you play the game. The in-game logs also allow you to delve deeper into the story if you wish to read them.Again I would rate this a 6/10, fun for others but not my kind of game.			"

												In the same vain as the first two games, Alien Breed 3 pits you, Conrad, against the genius insanity of Dr. Klien. Then gameplay is exactly what you would expect from the Alien Breed games, with the surroundings keeping true to the previous games style. My only gripe with the game is the ending, as I felt it was sudden and left quite a lot to be desired; almost made the entire series feel overly pointless; but you can be the judge for yourself as I still recommend playing.

												I own all three Alien Breed games and this one...it just doesn't quite get there.  The first two were solid, and in a way it was nice to get back to the swing of things.  The cool alien tactics, the lovingly detailed environments.  But after a while you realize this game is just more of the same.  The occasional new alien, but you can't even tell them from the old ones.  Your remaining nemesis, the computerized mind of an evil scientist, continuously taunts you from the sidelines with repetative (litterally repeating) dialogue.  But what really hurts it is that the screen shakes with explosions, continuously, for hours.  At first it kind of added tension to the game, this big action packed thing where the ship is crashing to the planet.  And just when I got sick of the constant explosions and shaking the ship made planetfall and I thought ""Ah, nice timing designers, it'll stop just when I'm sick of it.""  Except it doesn't stop, for some reason the ship just shakes constantly while it is lying there on the planet.  Did it land on a bouncy castle?  What the hell is going on with this ship?  You can't have tension unless you allow the plot moments to breath, and this game doesn't.  Even the pause screen is a mess of nausiating static.  My advice is to pick up the first one or two in the series, which are totally solid titles, and give this one a pass.			"

I had trouble launching the game and read the discussions and realised that all the people complaining were AMD users. The game uses PhysX, which is a Nvidia product and that is what is causing all the trouble.If you plan on buying this game, pray that you are lucky and that it works on your PC. Otherwise you are in for a hell of a lot of bug fixing to get this game working. I was busy for 3 hours try to fix it and I still couldn't get it running and gave up on it.

												Again, in itself a solid game, like the first two parts. Again I can recommend it - but not for the full price.The three basic weapons and the low upgrade tier are again your most trusty allies. The new weapons were...well I gues the electogun is nice but the 'Project X' is better off sold to buy a few med kits.The third person perspektive they sold big in the discription was rather unpleasent, hard to aim.The voice acting is good but like in the first two parts there could be more in the levels - and like at the end of th second part Klein is talking to much for someone with so few voice lines.On the positive site is the simple but still appealing story and the level designs are more diverse then in the previous two parts. Seeing the ice of the planet and the flooded parts of the ship helps. A few times I thought 'Hey! I was here before! Now I am here again and got wet socks!' But seriously the flooding helps. You see again surprisingly little for such a big ship. Also the ammount of random explosions are again up to the roof. No plus in itself but opposing to part 1 of the series the shell shock effects make it better - untill the point where you have run through a corridor that is basically blurry all the time.In the end I would say: Yep, the triology is quite nice...buy the bundle when its cheap and you are good to go. But If you pay more then 5 bucks per game you are overpaying it.			"

												At last, I've finished this game. Now I can move on to another one more interesting.The improvements seen on the second chapter felt flat, especially the story that wasn't worth following, and this was amplified by the voice-over of Klein.I think the gameplay is not challenging and rewarding enough : Aliens are kinda predictable, and you got no real incentive to kill them (except to move on) since they never drop anything of value like ammunition, grenades, medikits or ""armor fixes"".But the really dealbreaker is still the camera. Usually, when you can rotate the camera, the controls are here so you don't really think about it. In Alien Breed 3: Descent, the game always reminds you how bad they are. Plus, sometimes, the camera sticks to an angle not really appropriate and you wonder why...Play Shadowground Survivor instead.			"
