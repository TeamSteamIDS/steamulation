												In 2004, when Doom 3 was released, it was a glimpse into the future. The game represented a huge leap in visual fidelity and even manages to hold up well today, over a decade later. Furthermore, the sound design is unsurpassed and really immerses the player in the experience. The environmental storytelling with audio logs and emails was way ahead of its time and would be replicated in future blockbusters such as Bioshock. It is a true testament to how ahead of its time this game was in 2004 that it holds up so well today. I would highly recommend purchasing this version of Doom 3 over the BFG edition. First and foremost, the game was originally designed to have the player balance his use of flashlight and weapons. The BFG edition removes this gameplay element by allowing the player to use the flashlight and any weapon at the same time, removing some challenge from the game. The visual updates to the BFG edition are not substantial, search out comparison videos on YouTube for confirmation. This version will run perfect in 16:9 widescreen despite not having any 16:9 resolution options in the menu (requires modifying a .txt file).I really enjoyed playing this game again (last time I played was 2004). Campaign took me 11.2 hours on medium difficulty without rushing through. The campaign is much longer than many contemporary AAA FPS games. This game has held up incredibly well and is still excellent in 2015. Highly recommended for any FPS fans.			"

												I'm going to give Doom 3 an actual recommendation because I really think it is one of the more underrated games. Doom 3 is iD's attempt to revitalize the classic Doom series 10 years later. Doom 3 departs from the ""explore the floor"" style of older Doom games and is instead an attempt at a more linear/scripted action-horror game that was in my opinion pretty successful. The engine is a bit dated so the monsters don't have the frightening look going for them like the ones in newer games, but there's a great atmosphere that the game fosters of an invisible entity orchestrating the events happening around you. Most of the ""spooks"" come from the lights going out or the game applying the overused red filter to the display and then having a bunch of monsters come at you. While not nearly as frightening as Frictional's horror games (Penumbra/Amnesia), the approach to horror it takes is closer to those games than something like Dead Space, which is more like ""monsters jump out at you as a loud noise plays: the game"". While there are a few ""jump"" bits in the game, most of what made me enjoy Doom 3 was the atmosphere and the background noise that contributed to the experience. The gameplay overall is closer to Quake II than Doom, with the more linear format but still having little secrets around you can find. Overall a decent successor to Doom in my opinion.			"

												Doom 3 is a game that is very overlooked. It was Id's flagship title and features a very powerful game engine. It contained enhancements such as dynamic lighting, physics, bump mapping, portal technology among many other things we now take for granted. This was all months prior to Half Life 2 wowing us for the same thing.Doom 3 is essentially a remake or reboot of the series. It shares virtually the same premise as the original Doom, except set on Mars instead of it's moons. In a way this sort of gives the game it's own style but makes it feel less original. The aesthetic of the game was nailed very well, however the levels do get very samey after a while. For the vast majority of the game you're mostly running through maze-like corridors looking for ways to open doors. This was the first game I remember where I started to notice maze-like level design felt antiquated. I always kind of wished this game was more open and less claustraphobic.The game is still a horror game so they introduced dark environments with enemies shuffling around them. It also took a very bold risk where the player's flashlight is a separate weapon you equip. I personally like this mechanic but a lot of people, especially at the time hated it. And it was a frequent source of ridicule for the game. The gunplay in Doom 3 is something I never particularly liked, especially compared to it's successor Quake 4. The pistol is a joke that is never used after you get the shotgun, the shotgun is what you use for 70% of the game, the machine gun's firing sound effect makes it sound like a cap gun, the chaingun is very slow and cumbersome, the rocket launcher is extremely cool but only used on bigger enemies, and the plasma gun feels too slow to be useful. This was all corrected with very fantastic modifications but at the time I can understand why people didn't like it.In a way that's why I recommend this game. The engine Doom 3 used allowed it to be very heavily modified. There are a great deal of very good total conversion mods for the game, and it allowed Doom 3 to live on in our collective consciousness despite the game being only ""okay"". I do recommend the game for it's modifications more than anything else since that is what this game is most remembered for.

												Damn that was a REALLY long single player  campaign by today's standards,  it lasted around ~ 11 hrs while most of the fights were pretty easy to get through on  first try (must stop playing multiplayer FPSs lol )   heck even the final boss fight was VERY easy to beat ! i remembered this game 10 years ago to be hard as hell, maybe  the good old 6800gt was not very fast,  it only gave me  sub-60fps and lots of mouselag, higher systems specs = higher skill ceiling  :p  Anyway it still holds up REALLY well, the lighting the sound system ( don't get the BFG version, those greedy Bethesda ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s  replaced  openAL + EAX support  with  a sub-bar software accelerated  audio engine :S ) the gunplay, EVERYTHING looks and feels so smooth ! ,you can  even use  sound mods for that extra ""oopmh""  added to gunfire and/or get the total package with the absolute HD  mod, which replaces 90% of the game's textures adds DOF HDR  etc.Played the vanilla version from start to finish with no mods whatosever,  GOTY 2004 if you ask me, sorry  HL2 kids !

												Doom 3.DOOM 3.D00M 3.What else is there to say about this unbelievablly awesome First Person Shooter/Survival Horror game?This is possibly the greatest Reboot (Except for Wolfenstein the new order) ever made.The story is good. Even though it's the same story as before, it is expanded on here: there is a whole deep narrative and sci-fi lore that is both mysterious, and exciting, without really getting in the way of the gameplay.The voice acting, while ham-fisted, is awesome,The Writing is great, as it was written the author Matthew J. Costello, and the story feels like something out of a science fiction epic, like Dune and Star Trek.The ambiet noise & atmousphere? I know there are a LOT of games with good ambiet noise, but D00M 3 WINS HANDS DOWN, BEST AMBIET NOISE IN ANY VIDEOGAME MADE OR GOING TO BE MADE EVER. There are so manny sounds atop of sounds atop of sounds underneith sounds ATOP OF SOUNDS, some you don't even hear; they're just THERE.  This extends to the Music.  Now it may look like there are only a few songs, but what you don't realise is that the ENVIRONMENT tells the music. You can hear the oxygen cycle and refreash the room you are in, and the chiming and grunting of machinery can make for some really interesting and creative music and sound.  It's the kind of stuff that you just don't see in videogames anymore.The horror? Well, it may be cheezy, unoriginal, & full of jump-scares (Not jump-shocks or slender BS), but it feels VERY original for the time and since Doom was scary back in the day, you can't really critique this game for trying.The opening is well paced, and it set's the mood for the game quite well. Even though Half-Life did it first, D00M 3 does an EXCELLENT job of it too, and sets you up for the odyssey ahead.Plus that awesome Super Turbo Turkey Puncher 3 game cabinent is more then enough to get you hooked.The enemy designs are awesome: All (well, 85%) of the original monsters are back, with a few new original ones (Those Zombie Commandos)D00M 3 also has a HUUUUUUUUUUGE campaign length. Beating it would take roughly 12-17 hours to complete. What was that Killzone Shadow fall? only a 4 hour campaign??The Weapons are ALL the same from Doom 1 & 2 (abiet updated ones), but you get a Machine gun to use (A good mid-range weapon), Grenades (Bouncy-Bouncy-Bouncy: hard to control but effective) & a Flashlight (Oh yeah...)The game is VERY dark. That's one of it's selling points & why you should get D00M 3 & not the BFG edition: It's much more darker, & you can hold EITHER a flashlight or a gun. It might come off as annoying at first, but it sinks in, & it adds to the scare factor.Keep in mind this is a VERY different DooM game, up to the point where people question if it is a DooM game at ALL. But whatever you may think about D00M 3, it sold more than 5.3 million copies, making it the most successful game by it's developer id Software to date.I VERY HIGHLY recommend D00M 3 to anyone who likes FPS, anyone who likes Horror-survival, & pretty much to anyone who loves video games in general.This is a MUST PLAY5/5Editors Note: If you are going to play it, I highly recommend getting the Absolute HD mod for free off of Mod DB when playing this game: it makes it look a bit better, & it allows for modern resolutions without having to use the console commands.

												Doom 3 is a no-holds barred, adrenaline pumped thrill ride; I've never played a game that's kept me quite on the edge of my seat or has had me gripping my mouse as tightly as this one. Doom 3 is scary, fast paced and frantic, and I highly recommend it.This game is a first person shooter that has the player taking control of a Marine on Mars, who is forced to confront demons from Hell itself as they launch the space station on Mars into complete chaos; the story does not get much more complex and this, but hey, this is a Doom game, and I've never played the Doom series for story.The game plays like many other games of the genre, with the player using guns to survive through each level; a simple premise, but effective, and shooting is well crafted here, considering this is what the Doom series is known for. All of the guns handle well and each kill feels satisfying and earned, and each fight will leave you feeling oddly relieved.The atmosphere and sound design in this game is also quite good. Rather than hammering the player with an over the top musical score, this game prefers to use ambience to set the tone; creaks and groans of a decaying space station is far more effective at keeping the player on the edge of their seat. I found the dark environments great, as they left me in confusion as to where the next enemy would appear.My only complaint would be that this game is rather short, and the multiplayer is non-existent nowadays. These are small complaints in comparison to the immeasurable quality of gaming that Doom 3 provides, and I recommend it highly to both novices and veterans of the first person shooter scene. 9 / 10			"

												Yes, you may find some better horror. May be some better FPS actions do exist too (Or don't!). But no one game besides DooM^3 can match both genres in such a vigorous combination.Graphics still looks good and even much better than mostly other modern games in case you play it with mods.

												Doom 3 with the OpenCo-op mod is a blast. The game feels made for Co-Op; one of  you holds a light and the other takes the shots. The campaign is quite long and furthermore the game still manages to scare you every now and then, even playing with friends. It's a testament to the quality of the game. Furthermore, the game is beautiful for being nearly 10 years old. It certainly doesn't show it.

This is essentially the best Aliens game ever made. Captures the atmosphere and tone perfectly, and the supernatural twist with demons from HELL just makes it even better.Highly recommended!			"

												My opinion of this game has improved greatly over time.  After my first play-through, I would have described this as the most overrated game ever.  I thought that the game was too dark, too narrow, and too difficult.  In retrospect, I didn't give Doom 3 a completely fair shake.  On that first play-through, I immediately cranked up the gamma, I clung stubbornly to my two favorite weapons in every combat situation, and I resorted to cheat-codes to get me through large portions of the game.  I also mostly ignored the various computer screens and audio logs and just barreled forward as quickly as possible.I kept hearing other people rave about the game though, so I gave it a second chance and then a third chance.  And each time I've played it, I've enjoyed it a bit more.  I started taking my time, carefully choosing different weapons for different situations, and savoring the story told through the audio logs and emails.  At this point I feel that some of my initial criticisms were accurate while others were unfair.One of the controversial decisions the game designers made was to make you switch between your flashlight and weapon.  When I first got the game, on the recommendation of friends, I immediately installed a mod to enable the flashlight at all times.  However, on subsequent play-throughs I decided to play the game as it was intended, and I have to admit it does make many sections of the game a lot scarier.  However I do think the game goes too far in how dark it keeps everything.  It's one thing to include a few pitch-black sections, but even the brightest sections of this game are ridiculously dark; heck, even the first chapter--when the base is fully operational--is pretty dark.  I'm not sure if this was done to try to make the game scarier or to emphasize the strengths of the graphics engine, but either way I think it was a mistake not to include some well-lit areas.The graphics are, of course, very good.  They didn't make my jaw drop the way I expected (based on the pre-release hype), but it's certainly the best looking game of its time and the graphics engine is rock solid.  The levels are pretty large, load times are surprisingly short, and my frame-rate was always smooth as can be.  The graphics also appear to scale well to both older and newer systems.  There were a few innovative visual effects that I liked, such as when you stood at the edge of a steaming lava pit or looked through a thick window pane.It's clear that an effort was made to give Doom 3 a more realistic feel than the original Doom, and this is most obvious when comparing the new look of the monsters to what they used to look like.  An unfortunate downside is that the new enemies have less personality and are less distinctive from one another than they used to be.  In particular, I dislike the texture that was used for the skin of almost every monster - is it flesh? hide? carbon-fiber?  I thought it looked a little too shiny and inorganic.  But those minor complaints aside, the new enemy designs are pretty convincing and some of them are downright frightening to see up close.Where the game disappointed me most was in the level design, especially in the early sections of the game.  What I disliked was how small and confined every area was.  In the first third of the game, every single fight takes place in a narrow hallway or cramped office.  It gets a little better later in the game, but not much better.  Even the boss fights take place in surprisingly small areas, and the brief 'outdoor' sections are a joke.  The facility you are exploring feels like a real-world location, but there isn't much diversity between the various areas of the base, and there are very few sections that wowed me.  Remember how when you first played Half-Life, you experienced a ""holy s---!' moment around ever corner?  There are very few of those type of awe inspiring moments in Doom 3.Another major complaint I have about this game is the way that bullets bounce off of objects, surfaces, and even enemies in a very unconvincing manner.  Almost none of the environment is destructible.  Computer screens appear to be bullet-proof, office knick-knacks all seem to be glued to desks, and windows survive even the largest explosions.  Furthermore, ricocheting bullets sound the same whether you are shooting a window, a metal girder, or a zombie's flesh.  And worst of all, aside from some blood spatters (which it's too dark to see anyway), there isn't much feedback on whether you are damaging the monster you're fighting or not.  In the original Doom, shooting any of the smaller enemies would cause them to groan and stagger backwards; in Doom 3 they shrug it off and keep charging.  This hampers the gameplay significantly and results in all of the guns feeling less powerful than they really are.Once you get into the rhythm of the game and familiar with the various enemies, the combat is pretty satisfying.  Some people might find it repetitious by the end, but I never got tired of it.  And now that I've played the game a few times on a few different difficulties, I feel comfortable stating that the difficulty is actually very well balanced.  There are nine different weapons available, with different strengths and weaknesses.  A few of the guns are overpowered in my opinion, but none of them are completely useless.  (The chainsaw is back, and is as much fun to use as ever.)Despite the linear nature of the level design, the pacing of the enemy encounters is well planned.  Instead of putting a monster behind every corner, there are plenty of sections with no enemies which builds up suspense nicely.  There are also a lot of well scripted encounters with waves of enemies teleporting in all around you.  The one mistake the game makes, however, is delivering certain enemies too often and others not often enough.  Some of the more interesting demons barely make an appearance, while the imps show up again and again and again in every stage of the game.Doom 3 will probably take you around 20 hours to complete.  The story and the way the story is told borrows a lot from both Half-Life and System Shock 2.  The game gives you access to various characters' emails and audio logs through a PDA interface.  Technically, you could play through the entire game without ever opening your PDA, but if you do so you'll miss out, since most of the game's storytelling happens through the email and audio logs you find.  Many of the email messages are typical mundane office chatter that simply give you a sense of what life was like on the base before your arrival, while the audio logs document recent events that led up to the horror you are now experiencing.  Together, they help to give a bit of background and life to the otherwise barren environments.  (And the writing and voice acting are both very good.)One feature I really liked was how the game lets you interact with computer screens (to open doors, operate machinery, etc.); as you get close to a screen, your crosshair changes to a mouse cursor, while still centered where you are looking.  It's a very simple thing, but I've never seen another game handle 'use' buttons quite this elegantly.Finally, I was surprised to see that this game limits you to only run in short bursts, and that you need to hold down a key to do so.  This is a feature that would make sense in a tactical shooter, but it seems out of place in the Doom series, where half your time is spent dodging fireballs.In conclusion: I don't think I've ever had my opinion of a game improve so drastically over the years.  I still think Doom 3 is slightly overrated; it's not in the same league as the games it most resembles - Doom, Half-Life, and System Shock 2.  But it is a solid gaming experience that I would recommend to anyone, especially to hard-core FPS players and fans of horror. (If you are offended by demonic images or excessive gore you should probably stay away.)			"

												I have no regrets in spending 28 hours to this game. Over 13 years have passed since its release, and i never played it before.I think i missed one of the best games ever made.Stunning graphics, chilling atmosphere, brutal monsters, powerful weapons - you can see everything in it no matter how much years will pass.Indeed a great game, as shooter and as one of Doom games. I have no clue why people are hatin' on it just because it's not pulling out arcades.			"

												The forefather of first person shooters as we know it saw reinvention and rebirth some 11 years after it first revolutionized (if not invented) the genre of FPS. What Id Software brought to the table was a game-changing new graphics engine that pushed real-time lighting and 3D-relief ""bump mapped"" textures to polygon graphics; ultimately this game made startlingly real environments to serve as the Martian horrorhouse that became the setting of what was to be not a true sequel, but a reboot of the series. Doom 3 came across as a more cinematic and survival horror-themed take on the tale of one lone soldier's struggle to contain the hordes of Hell after a science experiment let them out across an isolated research station on Mars. They vied to reach Earth where they could take a more permanent hold on the mortal realm, but with an almost academic arsenal of firepower and a few tricks, the player must drive them back, eventually entering Hell itself to seal the hole created in reality from the other side. Open environments with color-coded locked doors and a maze-like construction gave way to linear progression through a much darker and more claustrophic base. The backtracking of the original games was replaced with a series of ""boo"" moments as demons jumped from every vent, doorway, and even materialize around, behind, or sometimes right on top of the player. Suspense and hair-trigger gameplay replace the circle-strafing constant-action of the originals, while a much stronger focus on story, both told in cinematics and collectable audio logs, certainly made this modern iteration of Doom more of an interactive thrill ride than before.The sheer darkness of the game can be overcome with a little bit of config file tweaking, as can the game's orignial 4:3 aspect ratio, field of view, and resolution options (make sure to set the config file as read-only after modding or it will revert), but players of more recent shooters will cry at this game's lack of weapon shouldering or even any kind of appreciable zoom aiming. The ""monster closets"" get a bit old after a few hours in, and the scare factor is thus reduced, but the game's atmosphere is the stuff of legend, especially in the way it makes players choose between wielding their flashlight and seeing what's hiding in every blackened corner, or firing at those glowing eyes in the darkness and hoping whatever it is doesn't eat you.The ""BFG Edition"" of this game released almost  8 years after the original adds a new episode consisting of recently-finished levels cut from the original game, but otherwise removes some of the more suspensful encounters, plus ups the enemy count, reduces their health, and increases ammo in order to make a more action-heavy shooter. These things diminish the horror feel, especially in the way the game mounts the flashlight onto the armor, so players can shoot and see in the dark simultaneously, but this I feel takes away from what the game was all about: fear of the unknown. Plus ""BFG Edition"" also presets the widescreen mode and higher resolutions by default, which is handy, but increases gamma and brightness to higher levels by default, and even pumps up the lighting itself in game, further eroding the horror feel. Finally, some of the original game's shadow rendering were replaced with softer techniques, which is a bummer. I get what Id Software was trying to do here with the BFG edition, but it didn't really need to be done. If the idea of optional motion blur, higher frame rate caps (120fps max),  or perhaps a bit more saturated color palette borrowed from the more-recent Rage engine, with -some- cleaned up textures sounds good to you, then maybe the BFG Edition is worth checking out. Otherwise, the original game holds up enough over time to still be a great suspenseful take on the 90's classic.			"

												If, by chance, you find yourself interested in trying out Doom 3, buy this version instead of BFG Edition, since the latter, besides being a power-hog and having removed the crucial gameplay element of constant switch-over between the weapon and flashlight, is, most importantly, has broken the ammo conserving mechanics by DOUBLING the amount of ammo you get per magazine you've picked up (you literally can never run out of bullets here)So, this version plays better, several times cheaper and can actually look much better with one simple tweak. Open a notepad, paste following (relevant for 16:9, 1080p resolution):set r_mode -1set r_customWidth 1920set r_customHeight 1080set image_lodbias ""-1.0""set image_anisotropy 8set r_multiSamples 0set r_aspectRatio 1seta com_videoRam ""2048""seta image_useCache ""0""seta image_roundDown ""0""seta image_usePrecompressedTextures ""0""seta image_useCompression ""0""seta image_useNormalCompression “0”seta image_downSizeLimit ""0""seta image_ignoreHighQuality ""0""seta image_downSizeBumpLimit ""0""seta image_downSizeSpecularLimit ""0""seta image_downSizeBump ""0""seta image_downSizeSpecular ""0""seta image_downSize ""0""seta image_forceDownSize ""0""seta image_roundDown ""0""And save it as Autoexec.cfg in game folder ,,,\steamapps\common\Doom 3\base\You can additionally set the antialiasing, but it is highly recommended to do so in your GPU driver control panel.There - you got yourself the BFG edition widescreen fix with a crisper image and without broken gameplay mechanics.

												Let me list the good and bad things about this game.First, this game has horrifying maps. I mean that in a good and bad way. It's scary, yes, but it also has these horrible twisting and looping maps that are so dark it's impossible to get through. Also when you first start the game, the weapons you have make pitiful attempts to injure some of the stronger enemies like Imps, though it gets better once you find more powerful weapons.Now the good things.If you're a fan of the original DOOM games, than YES BUY THIS! It's really fun for a DOOM fan to experience. It's awesome seeing the old pixelated monsters come to life in this game. Also, this game is truly terrifying. The darkness, and the constant demonic noises coming from your intercom make you barely have the courage to walk through the game. Overall, as a DOOM fan, I've enjoyed it. If you're new to the DOOM series, then go with the old ones, and see if you want to carry on with the epic saga of violence.			"

												DOOM 3 is a really cool game. It's a good reboot of the original DOOM from 1993. You will recognize all the enemies from the original game. I played it in it's vanilla form and still after all these years, DOOM 3 surprised me with it's graphics. DOOM 3 is really the best looking game from 2004, it looks still today really good, even vanilla. Yeah, on some textures you can see, that it is a 2004 game, but with mods you can improve everything.The sound is really nice. Exactly what you should expect from such a horror game. The menu theme is rocky and badass. I like that.I Finished the game after 20 hours of gameplay. A steam friend said to me, he played almost 12 hours, so I was maybe to busy with exploring the world and reading the PDAs? Anyway, it was fun. Some visual changes would be nice, but what do you expect from a base on mars? Of course its dark and alone there.I enjoyed this version a lot. I bought the BFG edition only for ""The Lost Missions"" and the ""DOOM II: No Rest for the Living"". The BFG edition would destroy some horror moments, when you are able to wear the flashlight and your weapon at the same time.I look forward to continue playing DOOM 3 with mods.			"

												Screw BFG Edition, original DOOM 3 is better. A lot of people are complaining about original, because it's too much darker or screen resolutions problem, learn to open settings and set your screen size, BFG dummies. DOOM 3 is very good game, it's designed to be a dark horror survival game,but BFG maked more lighter which is just not fun to be scared. BFG Edition is just full of bugs and it has Ultimate Doom and Doom 2 which are in another words broken games. BFG versions of Ultimate Doom and Doom 2 are just f*****g c**p. Why? Because they censored red crosses of health packs with pills and removed in Doom 2 two Wolfenstein levels: WW2 Nazi soldiers, flags, Hitler portraits,etc. and it reminds like non textured level from Bubsy 3D. When I played Doom 3 BFG Edition at my friend's house, I thought is this another beta versions of all Doom games?! If you wanna get all DOOM games, buy classic complete and Doom 3 pack and stay the F**K out of the BFG Edition. BTW, DOOM 3 BFG EDITION HOW I PLAYED IT I THINK IT IS ONLY FOR GERMANS ( I'm, not against Germans, btw), glitchy and non-scary and censored, because it's designed for them. Nowadays people got so scared on some new games and don't like old scary games to be scared, get real people!			"

												The slower you play it, the better it is. Although that is contrary to DOOM of the 90s, here is a game that deserves and rewards your careful attention, not with clever secrets but a strong feeling of immersion. The atmosphere and sense of mystery, especially near the beginning, are highly engaging - if you let them be.			"

												Don't be mistaken, DOOM 3 is in no way meant to be a successor to the original Doom games. But that doesn't at all mean it's a bad game, persay. Some may lambast it for being different, but it's no DNF for sure. For one thing, DOOM 3's gameplay takes a slower pace than the last two games in the series and benefits greatly from this change. No longer are you speeding through levels, never taking one look backwards at the scene. Instead, the game builds up it's mood to supplement it's slower action. Weapons mostly share the same functions as the old set from the originals and mostly feel like the original weapons in terms of gunplay. However, it adds a new variable in late game that rewards players for sustained killstreaks. However, the rocket launcher lose it's secondary utility in the closed-off levels. Now, the enemy AI seems rather one-note. Basic zombies merely walk at a snail's pace towards the player, making it incredibly easy to pick them off at range. Imps merely run after the player, throwing homing fireballs all the while in combination with melee attacks. But the Z-Sec and the Commando shows that their AI at least has some competency in it's making, if they're not very advanced. They make use of cover, strafe around and make ample use of manuevers in their combat. If I could make a comparison, they fight like the HECU from the original Half Life.  "

												I played this in November of 2016. It took me about 17 hours to do a play through. I was really pleased with how well this game aged.  Graphically, it could do with some textue packs, and the lighting effects were probably awesome in the day, but they're a little dated. But it's still alright. The gameplay is good solid pre-Halo FPS. There are probably only about 8 enemy types, plus bosses. They are mostly simpler, and the challenge comes from getting your health widdled down through the level. (Although the easier difficulties are pretty easy).  I remember when the game came out, there were two controversies: The Flashlight, and Monster Closets. Yes, the game used a whole lot of the best lighting effects it had available, and showed them off. Lots of places are poorly lit or completely dark, and you need to use a flashlight, and you can't have the flashlight and a gun at the same time. I get why it bugged people, but I enjoyed it. The enemies are simpler (especially in the flashlight-intensive areas), and it adds some suspsense and challenge. Monster Closets (that is, there are little closets all over the place that just hide enemies so they can jump out at you from behind later). Monster Closets did start to annoy me, but again, that is how pre-Halo FPSs worked. It helped with the immersion, because I was listening for enemies to come up behind me, and then when you get to rooms with loud machines in it, it was a lot more tense. I recommend the game, it's cheap, and it's fun.			"

												TL:DR A great Game, even if it's a complete 180 from all the other games in the series.Full Review: Firstly, I would like to say, this game is completely different from every other game in the Series, so don't go in expecting a fast-paced, non-linear FPS game. Instead, this is a slower, more linear, and more atmospheric horror game. With that being said, not only do these changes help to give the game deeper claws to keep its grasp on you, but the first half of the game (Up to and including the hell level, for those curious) is pure horror, all the way. For those worried though, The game returns towards (but not all the way to) the classic formula in the 2nd half of the game, while still mixing in some horror elements.Graphically, it looks fantastic for the time, and still looks good today, even if the polygon count reveals the game's true age (that last part may be due to the fact that I'm transitioning to PC gaming from Consoles...). The action is still DOOM at its core, although you'll need to pay more attention your ammo, as reloading is a thing in this game. One annoying issue, however, is that the game is very dark (again, especially in the first half of the game), which, while adding to the scare quotient, means that you can have issues when firing at demons in the darker rooms. You can easily switch between gun and flashlight using ""F"", but ideally, the game (probably) is expecting you to use your memory with the flashlight, and your hearing to attack the demons when you can't see it (I say this because the reticule turns red when you sucessfully deal damage to an enemy).If that does sound too annoying, you have 3 options:1. Install the ""Duct Tape"" mod (Google it, Adds a flashlight to the shotgun and the machine gun).2. Skip this version of the game, and get the BFG edition (Adds a temporary flashlight to use while holding any weapon).3. Train your memory and hearing, to get used to it (For best results with the scare quotient).Personally, I went with 1 at first, before switching to 3 later on (Because the game took away my guns and flashlight (and presumably my duct tape) at the start of the hell level, and I decided to play fair). If I had the money, I'd probably get the BFG edition, which also includes the previous two games as well!Regardless of what edition you pick up, and whether or not you decide to use the Duct Tape mod, You'll be pleasently surprised on how far id goes from the Traditional DOOM formula and still deliver a great, if somewhat flawed, experience.

												Doom3, the only game that had me jumping a couple of times, even during replays, stopped counting at a dozen (got a physical copy, just bought on steam for the convienience). Amazing atmosphere and cool action, best played on Veteran difficulty and later on Nightmare.This original version is so much better than the BGF edition, gameplay wise, and especially because of the mod support. Visually still great, if you get one of the amazing graphic mods like sikkmod with Wulfen's HD textures, or just Redux - look it up on MODDB - which has different HD textures already included and an already configured sikkmod, plus a couple of enhanced weapon sounds and a new menu.Tons of custom maps - single map style or campaign like - are available and ofc the already mentioned mods and more. Even a coop modification.Of the non graphic mods I can fully recommend the ""In Hell Directors Cut"" mod; 20+ maps with fast old doom gameplay style - no stamina limitation for running, secrets, clever level structures, no flashlight, secret levels - set in hell. Utterly brilliant and like a game on it's own right.Oh, and there's even some MP alive, well, to a certain extent at least.To set it to widescreen simply edit your config:seta r_customHeight ""1080""  -  whatever your resolution isseta r_customWidth ""1920"" -    whatever your resolution isseta r_mode ""-1""seta r_aspectRatio ""1""More than worth it's money!

												***I WROTE THIS REVIEW IN November of 2006... Found it on my HD and reposted it because I felt it still holds up- hope you enjoy it*To set the record straight, Doom 3 is hardly a sequel in the sense that none of the events of a Mars invaded Hell ever occurred. Think of it as a Doom adaptation. You are a Marine landing on the surface of Mars at a military research base reporting to your officer for orders. When you arrive you find you are to report to a lab to escort a scientist back to the military headquarters. So you grab a weapon and make your way down the dark passages of laboratories where civilian crewmembers are ominously talking about people who have mysteriously disappeared or have heard voices; hinting that something BIG is about to happen. When you finally meet up with the scientist, something goes terribly wrong and the forces of hell are released while demons pass through portals and soldiers are possessed across the red planet.For the next twenty minutes the game unleashes the best scare tactics and sequences of events I have ever experienced in a horror video game. But not only is game brilliant in scaring the crap out of you, the dark facility level design is absolutely perfect. Lights flicker as your fellow marines are screaming over the radio. Muffled sounds of shouts and gunfire on other side of walls or even demonic arms reaching through the walls all cause you to walk through each corridor cautiously with an itchy trigger finger.Gameplay:Upon your arrival on Mars, you are handed your very own PDA which you use throughout the game to acquire passwords to cabinets, open doors, read scientist's e-mail and voicemail and even watch videos that describe different areas of maps. Reading other scientist's e-mail is important throughout the game for they sometimes describe weakness in enemies and even reveal hidden stashes to ammo and health packs.So you have your PDA, what else do you need? Oh yeah, a flashlight. A flashlight? Yes a flashlight. To make Doom 3 scarier than it already is, the creators equipped our voiceless, nameless marine with a flashlight to check out those dark scary corners. But the catch is you cannot bear any weapons while you hold your flashlight. This means if there is indeed a zombie lurking in the shadows you better switch to your shotty quick!The weapons in Doom 3 are almost what you would expect from the original game. You start off with a meager handgun, upgrade to the shotgun, which upgrades to an assault gun, the basic 1, 2, 3 step formula in any FPS. What, you think they're gonna start you off with the BFG? As you progress, you eventually have the entire arsenal from the original Doom plus something special the creators added in the later portions. About half way through the game, the brilliant scripted sequences start to fade away and Doom 3 becomes more of a repetitive brainless shooter. Demons become less scary (even the newer ones) and you will start to predict where doors will open and how to handle the situations that are supposed to be tough. (that occurs when doors close and you are trapped in a room with 37 demons) What happened to the dazzling writing we saw in the game's opening?There was also one tribute to Doom the creators added that I absolutely love. Do you remember playing the original Doom, and sometimes when an imp fired one of it's fireballs at you and a possessed marine got in the way, the marine would start attacking the imp? Well I used to see how many enemies I could wake up and just run around the map for 10-15 minutes seeing how many enemies would die without me firing a single shot. Well Doom 3 also kept the same demons fighting demons portion, which made me laugh the first time I saw it. Too bad the maps in Doom 3 aren't square and rectangular like they used to be, it's a lot harder to run away from enemies.Graphics:I can't begin to express my satisfaction when I double clicked the Doom 3 icon on my desktop and watched the opening cut scene. From that point on the smooth textures and unique dark/bright lighting produces an amazing environment to battle demons. I also loved as you approach a cut scene, the camera pauses as your character continues to walk forward giving you an outer body experience as the cut scene begins. This happens every time a new monster is introduced over the course of the game. The cut scene ends when the camera seamlessly zooms into the back of your characters head, into is current vision. Very well done.Multiplayer:I know most people are not buying Doom 3 for the multiplayer experience but this is 2006 and games today pretty much come standard with multiplayer options. How many games today have an incredible single player story AND incredible multiplayer gameplay (or modification)? It is obvious Id concentrated entirely on the single player aspect and at the last minute threw in a small multiplayer option where you can join servers that supports up to 4 players. A tribute to old school Doom multiplayer maybe? Back when you had to dial your friend on your 14.4 kbps modem and run around shooting each other? Even if it is, the enjoyment quickly diminishes over time... exponentially! In fact, I can't find a reason to ever play Doom 3 MP again. The dark maps and quick paced gameplay does not translate well into multiplayer gaming even if there are only four players in a server. .Pros: Corridor shooter with heavy emphasis on unpredicted scares. Cons: Weak multiplayer, formulaic advance through game, well thought out scares turn into mundane annoyances.Bottom Line: A dark and morbid FPS like nothing you've ever seen. Interesting story and impressive real time action shots that will make your jaw drop. The Doom 3 engine however has room for improvement in an environment that only works for this genre of gameplay.

												Last great game by id Software, if you are a true pc player, buy this instead of the so-called ""BFG Edition"" console port, the latter is simply not worth it.I've beaten this game countless of times, recently re-bought it during Quakecon sale just to share some pics, with the latest sikkmod and wulfen texture max out, the game still looks amazing. Keep in mind though, this is an openGL game so regular DirectX tweaks might not work, luckily there're tons of mods to customize it, provided you have enough hardware power to run them.If you want this on Steam, I suggest picking this and RoE expansion during next sale for less than 3.5 bucks, then install the latest graphic mods, play this at night with lights off, and let your soul burn in hell! :D			"

												Doom 3 has a special place in my heart. It is the game that doesn't belong, the game no one remembers.Doom 3 actually managed to come out several months before Half Life 2, it was similar both in graphics and gameplay, yet Half Life 2 was the winner in the long run and Doom 3 seemed to fall by the wayside, despite its fair share of cult popularity. I think the difference was that Half Life 2 didn't fall victim to the 00s pressure to dust off old IPs and jack them up them with so-so writing and bizarre storylines.Doom 3 succeeds in terms of gameplay, it is a lovable action-horror game that can still give you a jump scare, its story and presentation are shaky sometimes, but that doesn't make it a bad game. I consider it a fine game because its fun to play and doesn't really do anything to offend me despite some of its shortcomings.			"

												I remember when i Originally bought this (retail back in 2004), i couldn't play it, due to video card.I had to resort to playing at 640 x 480, lowest EVERYTHING, while using EVERY LITTLE Graphical Tweak I could.Game may not have looked good when i played it, but at least i could play it.Now a days, i can play it fine without problems (although i can't run it with sikkmod yet.)Game was fun to play, but wasn't that scary, despite what they said in 2004. FEAR was more scarier.Playing this with the 3rd Party ""Last Man Standing"" coop mod is also fun.I remember making some fun mods when I was bored (Retail Version).Like guns holding WAY more ammo than normal (Shotgun holding 64 for example), guns do more damage (also changed the # of projectiles of the shotgun with each projectile doing more damage and much much lower spread), etc.I remember I was able to change the Machine Gun for example to shoot (active) hand grenades.It was fun to Troll the AI in campaign with that.I also remember changing the pistol to shoot BFG shots (yes, each shot fired 1 bfg shot).Doom 3 was a fun game overall (even if the AI at many times is stupid).I just hope Doom 4 Improves ALOT of things, while at the same time, stick to the old school Doom Gaming (not CoDish).

												I didn't grow up during the golden era of Doom and Doom 2, so I don't have any cherished memories of either or those games. I do remember seeing my friend's older brother playing this game the night it came out over a decade ago, and man did it look great. The visuals were specacular, the setting and synopsis were intriguing, and the survival horror aspect of it captivated me. Doom 3 is a very slow paced shooter, and although you can sprint around and get into a few bigger firefights, you'll spend most of your time exploring confined areas and digging through PDAs and other interactables. In most other games I would find that to be a huge turn off, but the atmosphere building is this game wins me over every time. I just recently picked up the new Doom (2016) and have been enjoying the hell out of it (badumtiss) but for very different reasons. If you want to scratch your itch for a horror/story heavy game with less twitch shooting, this will do you well. If plot and tension aren't your thing but you really want to gore some demons in fast motion, Doom 2016 is the better choice.			"

ID has never made a bad game, and games like this get a bad rap from people who wanted another Halflife, DOOM2, Call of Duty or Painkiller.  A slow paced action game with lots of quality gameplay for the gamer who goes in with an open mind rather than specific expectations.			"

												I remember when this game came out, I remember wanting this Doom 3 so bad.  I was at first disappointed at certain re-designs, and was sad that, although it was Doom ""3"" it was basically a storyline reboot...  but all of that was forgotten when I was busy scaring myself half way to death.  In college, I had a room mate who was playing the game, when he suddenly jumped up from his keyboard, turned on every light in the room, quit the game, and said ""I'll try again tomorrow.""  He scared himself back to childhood!Doom 3 is one of the greats.  It's critically underrated, it can be a ton of fun.  Enjoy it!			"

												Well I've been playing this game since over a month ago. Why has it taken me this long to play through it? Probably two things, distractions from other games and the repetition that Doom 3 has. Doom 3 was made by id Software back in 2004 and it's sort of like a reboot to the original in a way since it doesn't follow the past two games. Just think of it like The Legend of Zelda as you can jump into any game at any time. No need to know any important storyline, not like there is much of a story. Doom 3 is about a scientist in Mars who has gone mad and opens a portal to hell killing nearly everbody thus you're the last marine who must stop the demons invading using the only skill you have. Starting a genicide on anything that the Pope does not approve of. There are some basic characters, cutscenes, even audiologs and emails to read which a lot of the time it's not all that interesting and the only reason to read and listen to said audiologs and emails is to get codes for supply caches.Weapons are good but not great. You have a decent variety of weapons like the shotgun, SMG and rocket launcher. I enjoyed using the Plasma Gun and the BFG was fun the three times I ever got to use it. Enemies are diverse but are hit or miss. I hate the spider ones because who enjoys shooting a bunch of #!$@ing spiders in every game ever? Also some enemies leap at you as soon as you enter a room which is both unfair and gets annoying real quick. I also found it really weird how sometimes I can shoot an Imp with the shotgun in point blank range and it'll die but the same thing happens again and it takes two hits. I could be wrong but there is something very off about it, possible poor hit detection.Level design is okay at first, it's really creepy and some noises of screams and creaks tend to unsettle me but sooner or later it's just a matter of entering a room, demons spawning and you gotta shoot them all. It becomes dull, predictable and annoying and some areas are really cramped so dodging an Imp fireball can be at times impossible which makes it again unfair. I found that after I entered and left Hell I got real sick of it and I consider the rest of the game (2-4 hours) to just be padding it out. It really angered me when all I just wanted to do was move forward but a door says I don't have clearence and I need to find a keycard for it. It's not that the environment changes much either. For 80% of the game you'll be in a dark corridor of some kind of science facility and it leaves me wanting a bit more variation.I think this game has a lot of smaller problems rather than a couple of really big problems. It only shows the longer you play it. You can tell that Doom 3 was influenced by Half Life which is ironic considering Half Life was initially inspired by Doom. I don't think it's a bad game by any means, it's actually an alright game to play through but this wouldn't really be a top recommendation of mine. I'd go with something like Half Life or Bioshock first but that's just my personal tastes. If you're interested then it's worth a go and it goes on sale for very low often. I give it a 6/10.			"

												This game was brutal when it came out, and still to this day stays brutal.  It's not as polished as newer titles and most games that have come out since, but it's 12~13 years old now!  It's still holding up pretty good.   Also back then, this is all we had and we liked it!   It was a step up from Doom/Doom2... and it was glorious.   If you are going for yester-year memories of this game, buy it on sale.  If you are a newer player, maybe stick with Doom (2016) or get the BFG version of this game.   It'll do you right.			"

												This is a very scary game, as advertised. The graphics are fairly dated at this point in time, & the Acer Aspire had no issue with them. It is too much to play for more than an hour or two at a time, because the ""jump scares"" are exhausting. That is that thing where a monster bursts out of a closet or vent to 'git' you. That is surprising, yes, but also irritating. The atmosphere is quite dark & creepy so I suppose it is successful at creating the feeling that they seem to have been intending to create. I feel like this game is similar to Quake4, but darker, and to Unreal tournament, but MUCH darker/scarier. In terms of graphics it is probably about as good as Wolfenstein 3D. It goes well with a pizza & soda, as i discovered myself just now. For $5 it is somewhat fun & probably worth buying if you are gunning to play something scary for a bit. It is fun sometimes to run old games in ULTIMATE MAXED OUT graphics settings.			"

												You have heard of this game before, everyone has, so why not give it a try?First off the main reasons to choose this over doom 3 bfg edition is that the chain gun and plasma gun fire faster, this version seems a bit more difficult, and there are more mods for this than there are for bfg edition. id did a magnificient job on the world in this game from the machinery that operates itself when there are no humans around, to the creepy audio logs and emails explaining how bad working on mars can really be. All weapons are powerful (not counting the pistol ofcourse) and play a different role in terms of combat, so you can use just the plasma gun but ammo will be scarce until later on in the game. The graphics certainly have aged since 2004 but thats not to say they are bad. The game looks fantastic without any HD mods and thats a minor complaint considering its 10 years old. The game is definitely creepy, while I personally was never scared to go into a dark hallway (mostly because I have such a devasting set of weapons to choose from) there are a lot of jump scares and a lot of random sounds that make the hair stand up on your neck. Not to mention the excellent sounds they used to amp the situation youre in. Did I mention you can tear into demon babies with a chainsaw? That right there should be enough!! (though that is atleast halfway into the game). "

The gameplay is fast and very enjoyable and the guns feel great and powerful. Just avoid the BFG edition and stick with the original instead.

												Doom veterans who play this game for the first time will most likely find themselfs agrivated that it wasn't what they were expecting. ""I payed for a DOOM game, not some slow crappy space shooter!"" they would say. ""What were they THINKING?!""Well, here's my take on what happened:ID team: ""Alright, so we have this brand new IP we want to introduce. We're not sure yet on what it's name is, but It's going to be a dark, atmospheric, and tense first person game in the tight corridors of a space station. There will be these hideous alien creatures and parasites that turn people into zombies, and it's up to you as a staff member on the station to kill through the hordes of aliens and shut down the portal they're comming from while collecting key codes, notes, an alien artifact, and audio logs along the way.""ID execs: ""Alright, the idea seems fine, but no one is going to be interested in an unknown IP. The only way we'll sign off on it is if it's part of a pre-existing series so people will actually buy.ID team: ""Well, I guess Doom takes place on Mars. Alright, I guess we can just remodel the aliens as the Doom enemies and have like, 2 hell levels thrown in and we can call it ""DOOM 3"" ""So in short, yes, Doom 3 is not going to be the game you're expecting. But for what it is, it's a finely tuned Sci-Fi shooter with secrets to be found and the dark unknown to be explored. Once you're put into the right state of mind, it's a very satisfying experience.

												Though my play time says I've only played this for fifteen minutes, rest assured, I played and completed this entire game. It took me many years to work my way through Doom 3, on multiple copies of the game.Doom 3 is a game that wants to be many things. It is good at basically none of them. Many of the things it wants to be contradict each other. It wants to be scary, but it also wants to be macho action. It wants to be Half-Life (and specifically Half-Life), but it also wants to stay Doom. It is neither scary nor action-packed, its story doesn't make any sense, and its villain doesn't actually state any real intended motive. Demons arrive on Mars with the help of Dr. Betruger and want to use our space ships to travel to earth. Think about that for a moment: demons have to use our ships for their invasion, and the game goes out of its way to imply they're rare enough that they aren't readily available. When the first 15 or 20 demons get to earth, what do they think will happen when they get there? Do they think they'll just order another shipment of demons from Mars until, 20 demons at a time, they've conquered the entire planet, unopposed?And why does Betruger want to help the demons reach earth? He just does, because that's all the reason anyone needs, apparently. There are dozens of email logs, a bunch of lore about the origin of the demons and why a portal to hell even exists, but the antagonist is evil just because he's evil, like a Saturday Morning Cartoon villain.The real heart of the problem is the gameplay. Flashlight issues aside, gun play is slow and clumsy. Weapons take forever to reload, and once you start reloading your gun, you can't switch to something else. Often I'd get in to scenarios where I'd empty the clip in one gun, only to have my character start reloading it automatically, locking me in to a long animation. Your only option in that scenario is to watch your character slowly slot each individual shotgun shell in to the barrel, all the while helplessly dancing around incoming enemies. This feels like a horror game mechanic designed to make you panic, but it most frequently happened to me during a part of the game where it's trying to ramp up the action. It creates a very frustrating disconnect, because any logical human would just switch to a different weapon and reload that other gun later. And then there's the ending, with one of the most limp final bosses I've ever encountered and a crummy cliffhanger to set up the expansion pack, Resurrection of Evil. The last thing I wanted out of this game at the end was a stupid ""Gotcha!"" moment, but that's exactly what it has.Doom 3 has a reputation that can't be ignored, but I figured it was at least interesting enough to see through to the end. I was wrong. Curiosity killed the Cacodemon.			"

												TIME TO COMPLETE: 17.5 hoursWhile it might not be as frentic as the originals or this year's title, Doom 3 is a great game. Ranging from animations to lighting, atmosphere and sound this game has aged well were it not for the low-poly models. But hey, back then you had to compensate ! The models look average for the most part (because of the lighting aspect put to good use) and there are only some specific moments where you get to see their true ugly-ness. Textures are blurry even on the highest setting and this is the only thing I feel could be improved on, but otherwise they look good from a distance or at a quick view.The weapons are so-and-so. Some of them feel just perfect (like the chaingun, plasmagun and rocket launcher) while some are either too weak or too quiet (the pistol and machinegun). Either way they are adequate to use and the combat doesn't feel clunky if you can get on with the slow, methodical aproach Doom 3 wants to take.Overall I think Doom 3 is a great game but at the same time an acquired taste. If you loved the originals to death I recommend you try this somewhere else before buying just for reassurance. Otherwise you could go blind but would have to be very open-minded. Make sure to set the sound settings to ""Surround"" instead of ""Stereo"" because this is a very important step in immersion. I found myself using some phone headphones (not even real headphones, lol) while playing and wondered why the sound wasn't as great as it used to be. If there's one thing as to why I would recommend Doom 3 over the BFG Edition is because of mods. Not only you can make it look unimaginably better, but there are also numerous singleplayer maps which can increase your play-time.			"

												On its own it's a good game, but it feels way too different from the first two games in the series to be called a DOOM game. Rather than having fast-paced action found in the first two games, fighting dozens, and sometimes dozens UPON dozens of enemies in large rooms, DOOM 3 stands out as being more of a horror game.In contrast to DOOM 1 and DOOM 2, DOOM 3 is slower-paced and linear, with generally less space to move around freely and spray bullets like a madman at your enemies. You'll usually fight enemies either one at a time, or in small groups. If you like being spooked and having more than 2 guns at once, then you'll probably have fun with this game.Oh yeah, the story.

												Doom 3 lives up to its legacy and is a great game for fans of high-octane first person shooters.  The gunplay is great and the story is far superior to what I was expecting.  Many of your favorite enemies and weapons return and I found myself hooked on this game from start to finish.  That was about sixteen hours for me - an impressive length for a FPS and even more impressive that it held my attention.Since Doom is Doom, I won't go into the specifics as we all probably have the general idea already, but I will say that this is a great game that has stood the test of time.  I started playing this over a decade after it came out and it did not disappoint.  The graphics are a bit dated, but that's to be expected, and they are still good enough that I didn't feel that it detracted from the experience at all. I highly recommend this to first-person shooter fans and can easily say that it's a can't-miss game for fans of the old-school shooters like Duke Nukem, Quake, and... well... Doom.			"

												Doom 3 is the most darkest game i've played, even the bright setting did't do anything. To see in this game you have a flashlight or (torch) in english. and that how my character is a Janitor. Yes my characters name is janitor becouse you'll spend more time with the flashligth than with your weapon drawn. anyway the game really loves ketchup, seriously there's ketchup were ever you go. On the walls, floor computers and even on the roof. you can still find some survivors who give's you their PDA (like a ipad) where they tells you (or whoever is listening) how they ♥♥♥♥ed up. you can also find PDA form dead person's that can contain a Security acces or a password for a locker with ammo, health and stuff of that kind. Doom 3 is fun. Still Doom 3 Is a old game. My oppinion is that old games have more intresting and well made storyline.I would give this a 7/10I recomend it.But be warned that this game contains some jumpscares and a horrifying atmosphere that makes your brain say ""uuhh uhh, I aint goin in ther!""

Demons from mars.DOOM 3 is classic action-horror game. It was a re-boot to the 'DOOM' series, abandoning open environment for the traditional jump scares.PlotYou play as an unnammed marine who has been recently transfered to the Mars Space Station run by the UAC. As you can expect, things on mars aren't as they seem and soon demons take over the station. It is your job to send these freaks back to where they came from.GameplayMajority of the game is shooting and collecting items. You have a wide range of weapons including pistol, shotgun, machine gun, grenades, chainsaw, pulse rifle. If your feeling crazy, you can even use your fists. Levels are seperated via areas on the station, with each area reached by elevator or other transport. You have both health and armor which you can replenish via pick up items. Ammo can be found in the area or dropped from foes. You face a variety of foes such as zombies, security, skulls, imps, hell knight and other foes which take inspiration from previous entries. There are also boss battles which occur in later levels.AudioMusic is excellent at instilling the dark atmosphere. There isn't much background music during gameplay, which makes you focus on the various sounds such and creaks and footsteps nearby, keeping players feeling edgy and uncomfortable.ConclusionIf you are looking for a good action horror game, Doom 3 will not dissapoint.

												Just now finished playing through DOOM 3. I had lots and lots of fun playing this! I remember playing this when it first was out in 2004 when it came out for the PC. I use to watch my dad play the original DOOM games on floppy discs when I was a kid (PC gaming started at a young age for me! lol). Plaything through DOOM 3 was both a very fun and scary experience. The atmosphere the game puts you in is amazing. I recommend this game to any FPS fan and any fan of the original DOOM games or fans of id games. DOOM 3 is probably one of the best FPS games I have played- I'm playing through DOOM 3: resurrection of evil and will write a review when complete. Can't wait for when the new DOOM game is out!!

												Great game. A bit linear though, which is a sad departure from the originals.Not many enemies at once, so no more you verse an army at once but still fun (limitation of when it was released, already put computers at the time to the test.) Along with rooms being more of small corridors and no real open room combat. Many complained about the whole flashlight deal in the game, but I actually enjoyed that, the whole dark areas just added that much more to the feel.			"

												So I beat this game a few years ago and I am just now reviewing it, Its not like the other two DOOM games before it, ID software obviously wanted to try a more survival horror feel with this one, and I think they really captured it. Gone is the fast paced movement and destroying rooms full of demons with a shotgun and more of a slow subtle approach with jump scares and blacked out areas where you will be ambushed. There is a flashlight mechanic that you either love or hate, but I liked it from a survival horror standpoint. The game does lack the secret rooms we were all used to, id say there still is some secret rooms here and there and you have storage lockers where you need a code for goodies. but you still have hidden health packs and ammo and even data pads (which add a bit of story of the now deceased members) I honestly loved some of the data pads, some were very unnerving. Overall the game can be quite linear, there's no real way around certain areas and there can be a little back tracking to open certain doors but overall I don't think you will get lost too bad. The game is still scary and holds up pretty well today, just don't go in thinking it will be like previous DOOM entries and be prepared for a slow dark decent into Hell...			"

												I love this game, I know a lot of people in the Doom community hates it and I'm not a Doom fanboy, I don't automatically like everything with the Doom name, such as the god awful movie, but Doom 3 is in fact a good game, it didn't have the impact the original had, let's be honest, no future Doom game or any first-person shooter game in general is going to have the impact the original Doom had. The most id Software can do is make an enjoyable Doom game and they succeeded here. I love the horror genre and I love how id Software worked hard to make the game scary. I say give the game a chance, it's still a lot of fun, although online multiplayer is pretty much deader than a graveyard so you won't see many people playing online unfortunately. But the single player mode is a lot of fun. I do recommend you play this. For only $5, it's a good deal.			"

												It may be the most slow paced Doom, but damn if it isn't cool and innovative.It has cool touch screen panels you interact with your mouse, and a bottomless pit of (some clever) jumpscares.Some weapons have their ammo count on the actual gun, instead of a HUD element, neat.Some characters look a bit wonky, notably around the head area. However, the environments are well detailed, even if it's much of the same. Also, the shadows are so heavy, I feel like theres a 50 pound weight on my head whenever I'm under a shadow. It's like those damn F.E.A.R./Condemned: Criminal Origins shadows, but even heavier.There's a bunch of audio logs and PDAs you can shuffle throughout the game for some optional dialogue/text and whatnot, as well as some codes for unlocking lockers/rooms for equipment and items.Combat is pretty fun, shoot a zombie up close in the face with a shotgun, they hit the floor harder than a slab of meat made out of brick. A chainsaw with unlimited fuel to wreak havoc, up close and personal like. Rocket Launcher that make demons go boom, and an overly expensive experimental energy weapon, the BFG 9000 that wrecks rooms clean.It's an immersive horror FPS with demons n' ♥♥♥♥ coming out the walls. Play it on max graphics, and on hard difficulty, with death metal playing in the background in complete darkness for maximum effect.			"

												Doom 3 is special. hate it love it marry or divorce it I will always remember doom 3 from it's graphics to it's small tight fast paced gameplay to it's creepy designed levels and creatures from hell looks and sounds. Even when I was playing doom(2016) I keep thinking of the sneakey ways I could hook up again with doom 3 playing on the hard difficulty is the way to go. In the chance that the worry bug is going around I ran the game using windows 10 Ran at 60fps the entire time also I was using a r9 270, fx-6300@3.5ghz and 8gb's of ram I had no preformance issues:) This video sould help you get the game running on modern resoultions.

												Doom 3. What can be said about Doom 3? It's the third game in a long line of games that helped revolutionize the FPS genre. It's also the game that came out around the same time as Half-Life 2, as well as deviating from the run and gun playstyle from the first two, instead opting for a more horror survival gameplay and making lighting a central theme around it as well, has it aged well?I'd say yes. I think the initial disappointment from a lot of fans came as a result of this game not being the same as the first two, and honestly, in my opinion, I don't think that's a bad thing at all. It's a slower paced game than its predecessors that's for sure, fleshing out its story and narrative through ingame cutscenes and chracter's PDA's, similar to what modern games nowadays are doing... think like BioShock. A lot of people also had complaints with the flashlight system, which is (imo) what lends to the tension you feel throughout the whole game. If you have issues with that however, there's mods, as well the BFG edition which remedies this (which also brightens up some textures from my understanding), but in my opinion that takes away from the atmosphere they were going for in this game. They consciously made the design choice of making you choose between having your gun out, or your flashlight out to scout the darkness, the light giving you a sense of comfort while also leaving you completely defenseless while doing so. Granted, there are some moments when certain enemies will cheaply spawn behind you, or in complete darkness. The game is also a lot longer than I remember it being, its single player campaign clocking in at around 10-15 hours, depending on how you approach things, although to be fair, I think the game starts off kind of slow, easing the player into the narrative before all hell breaks loose. The latter half of the game being very action packed moreso than the beginning.  I think this game was ahead of its time, and I feel it's not as fondly remembered as HL2, but I still think it's a great experience, and one of the last Doom games to be developed by the original id team, before the license was shipped over to Bethesda, definitely an end of an era. Closing out, I have to say I played through it with a graphics mod, to bring the graphics up to date a bit, there's several of them out there but the one I installed was Doom 3 Redux, you can find it among others over on the moddb site.I highly recommend to fans of survival horrors, and first person shooters. One of the better titles that came out during that era. Would definitely suggest playing it with an HD texture pack as well, the game holds up suprisingly well when using them.			"

												Doom and its sequel were THE BEST GAMES EVER in terms of good gunplay, fluid movement, twitch reaction, and replayability factor. This is NOT a Doom game. Ridiculously dark, in an attempt to create a tense and scary atmosphere. If you dont fancy modding the game this means hours of walking into walls essentially feeling your way round the perimiters of small rooms full of random clutter that cannot simply be walked over, but has to be kicked, tripped over and caught on.Depleting stamina bar means no unlimited running, seems a bit strange that someone would suddenly become too tired to jog when all manner of hellspawn are chasing after him. Shotgun is a bad joke, easily possible to completely miss every pellet at a range of less than 2 meters. View flinch when hit is probably the worst i have ever seen in any game ever. This is not helped by the random swarms of small ankle biting monsters in totally dark corridors full of crap to trip over. These last few issues combined make this a painfully bad experience. Some people seem to think that getting triple-slapped when you cant even see what youre supposed to be shooting at is an intended game mechanic that adds to the atmosphere. Are you for real?Anyway il leave it down to you whether you think this is worth the purchase on nostalgia factor alone, but this review is coming from a lifelong doom fan who bought this game for less than £2, and i still feel as though i wasted my money.

												Everytime I fight a chaingun dude who never misses one shot, I hate the guts of this game. At all other times, Doom 3's long campaign friggin rocks: great graphix & sounds, some of the best monster design in FPS games ever, lots of deranged horror bloodbath and a gun selection capable of proper demon genocide. Levels may be a bit repetitive, but it gets better towards the end and the HELL episode is id Software's masterpiece. 79482 out of ten, would dismember a Cyberdemon with the soul cube again.			"

												Doom 3 is a astounding game that combines the First Person Shooter style-gameplay of previous Doom games with revolutionary graphics that still stand up to modern titles. I prefer the original to the BFG Edition as Doom 3 was one of the first games I got on Steam and holds a special place in my heart.The scares still get me everytime, even though I've played through the game in it's entirety several times.Nothing compares to the satisfaction of pumping an Imp coming at you down a dimly-lit corridor with led from your trusty shotgun, still being wary of what's around every dark corner.In addition, the lighting was one of the most hyped up things about this game, and boy does it deserve it. The lighting in this game is great even by modern standards, the dynamic lighting is realistic and I honestly enjoy taking in the scenery of the Mars Base.The sound effects are quite nice, and the monsters genuinely sound intimidating, I jump everytime I hear something behind me in a blood-showered hallway with flickering lights, because I know that means it's back to Demon Killing.I'd recommend this game to any fan of previous Doom games, fans of Horror, fans of FPS games, or a combination of all those things.

												Played a lot this game when it came out. Don't let the great gunplay of this game fool you: no matter how badass those weapons are, monsters and atmosphere is still gonna scare you a lot. If you miss the old school shooting or like horror and forgive action (just like Resident Evil 4) get this. If you like both, then you gonna have a good time.Plus you get a lot of mod support.The game may be repetitive in the long term,  but you can always finish a level or two and stopping before coming back. I suggest you to try to finish any level without quicksaving to wreck your nerves :PIf you think a good FPS needs to have samey infantry enemies (guys with gun wich you kill with guns), dogs, and homogeneized gunplay where the SMGs, Assault Rifles, Carbines, and LMGs have magically the same balistic precision, don't get this game. But please point a real gun at your face and pull the trigger. Games as good as this are very few thanks to that.			"

With Doom being the game that all modern day FPSs owe their lives to, Doom 3 takes the story even deeper than the original 2, and to an even more terrifying level with a new 3D world to explore. It truly is one of the pioneers of the horror genre, with a delicious amount of gore, and tons of scares galore. (Ha I rhymed) It's totally worth the price, and is sure to make you look over your shoulder while playing. I totally recommend it! Hope you guys enjoy!			"

												First off, it is actually possible to run Doom 3 natively on Linux. (Google is your friend in this regard.) If you do so, the Linux installation will be independent of Steam, although it will be dependent on the CD key which is also provided by Steam. (Which is why my time played appears much lower than it actually is.) So that's a thing.Doom 3 is an excellent FPS. It is a game where most weapons feel powerful and a little bit of tactical movement will go a long way. Here's what I mean by tactical movement: I see an imp, dodge its fireball, and immediately sprint up to it and give it a shotgun blast before it can retaliate. When a Revenant fires at me, I move backwards along a tight circular path to throw off the rocket's homing capability. Generally, dodge and counterattack will be a pretty common habit within this game.While the weapons are pretty standard, they do their job quite nicely. A rocket will send a ragdoll flying, the chaingun makes a thunderous hail of death, the plasma gun lays down a huge volume of fire (and can even block projectiles when used by a sufficiently skilled player), the chainsaw is so effective that it kills the atmosphere, and the BFG literally destroys everything in sight.Except for lousy model quality, I think that this game is very nice looking and has aged rather well. This is one of its cardinal sins: if a game has great graphics but not a memorable story, it will be forever branded as a tech demo because you can't please everyone with just your gameplay. As for story, the story is basic and somewhat cliche, but I do love the character of Dr. Betruger. But if you're a story freak and possibly a cynic in that regard, then you will have a bad time.And this game is long to the point of being a fault. It feels like it should be over at the end of the hell level, but it just keeps going. (Granted there are some fun encounters after that point.)By the way, don't worry about the flashlight. People complain about how you have to choose between holding a gun or a flashlight, but the only enemies you will fight when you need the light are zombies, which won't be much of a problem, and imps, which obligingly light themselves up for your convenience.Ultimitately, I can't tell you whether or not you will enjoy Doom 3, but I personally think that it is a high quality shooter and that at the very least you should pick it up on sale if you have any interest at all.

												Doom 3 is a astounding game that combines the First Person Shooter style-gameplay of previous Doom games with revolutionary graphics that still stand up to modern titles. I prefer the original to the BFG Edition as Doom 3 was one of the first games I got on Steam and holds a special place in my heart.The scares still get me everytime, even though I've played through the game in it's entirety several times.Nothing compares to the satisfaction of pumping an Imp coming at you down a dimly-lit corridor with led from your trusty shotgun, still being wary of what's around every dark corner.In addition, the lighting was one of the most hyped up things about this game, and boy does it deserve it. The lighting in this game is great even by modern standards, the dynamic lighting is realistic and I honestly enjoy taking in the scenery of the Mars Base.The sound effects are quite nice, and the monsters genuinely sound intimidating, I jump everytime I hear something behind me in a blood-showered hallway with flickering lights, because I know that means it's back to Demon Killing.I'd recommend this game to any fan of previous Doom games, fans of Horror, fans of FPS games, or a combination of all those things.

												2004 was a big year for gaming. Metal Gear Solid 3 rocked the then-developing Stealth-Action genre, Ninja Gaiden rebooted the dormant NES franchise, Silent Hill 4 sent it's series down a long, dark path (and not in a good way), and we were met with numerous first person shooters: Halo 2, Far Cry, Painkiller, Half-Life 2, Counter Strike: Source, and this gem, Doom 3.Part of the reason why Doom 3 was such a big deal, was the fact that it was a huge departure from the traditional Doom formula. The first two Doom games were simple, straightforward shooters. Here are the bad guys, kill all of them, get to the end of the area. It was super fast-paced, and pumped full of adrenaline. There wasn't much of a story, besides a few walls of text between episodes or levels. Doom 3 had a slower, more sinister approach. The story is much more prominent, being written by Sci-Fi author Matthew Costello. Besides infrequent cutscenes, there are also audio logs, similar to System Shock 2, which help tell the lore of the game. The game is also more horror-focused than Doom 1 and 2. Back then, jump scares really weren't a thing. Doom 3 is partly to blame for the prominence of jump scares, however, this does them right.Doom 3 was also a big deal due to the new lighting engine it had. Back then, there was nothing like it, and a lot of games still don't have dynamic lighting this good. id Software really showed the gaming world what it could do with this game, and it's impressive.10/10It's okay. I guess.			"

												While Doom 3 is not a 100% action drived shooter like the old ones, it is still a fantastic game.Rather than being a sequel to Doom II, Doom 3 is more or less a remake of the first Doom, putting more emphasis on story and atmosphere than the previous games.You once again play a nameless Marine who arrives on Mars. Rather than start right in on the action, your first assignment is simply check up on a scientist that is working on a project that is quite big.Of course, it doesn't take long for everything to go to ♥♥♥♥. Hell quickly invades the base and of course its up to you to fix EVERYTHING.The narrative is pretty good, and its simplicity doesnt deter from the games action. The game itself is dark and scary, which even though it relies on jump scares quite a lot, it still feels nice and the ambience is great.In alot of aspects, the game feels alot like the PSX port of Doom, relying on scare factor than badass factor. Yeah you still ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up ALL BY YOURSELF but you do still feel like you can easily be brought down, which when done right (as it is here.) , creates a really enjoyable experience.			"

												Easily one of the best games ever made. If you like ANY FPS, I don't care what it is, I PROMISE that you will love Doom 3.Sikkmod and the EMZ mod make it even better. Sikkmod improved the graphics and makes all of your weapons sound powerful. Sikkmod also lets you customize most things in the singleplayer. You can do all kinds of things with Sikkmod, like use infrared goggles, customize the damadge demons do, make demons spawn out of nowhere at certain times (which makes the game even scarier), change the health system, be able to have an arnour mounted flashlight (the light radius is VERY small, it keeps the horror atmosphere there) EMZ improves Doom 3's multiplayer. It has more maps and more options for multiplayer.I would also like to say that this game is scary as hell. It gives me a heart attack every time I play it.			"

												This game divides people’s opinions to the point where very few games are this polarising, you have what are called the doom purists who absolutely hate this game because it’s not a carbon copy of the originals and you have people who do like it. So this begs the question of how doom-like this game really is.Similarities: There is a lot of satanic and gory imagery. The weapons are the same with a small handful of new editions being: grenades and a machinegun.The enemies are the same (though some enemies move quicker than the original counterparts and some move slower than the original counterparts, and some are a little weaker than before.) with a few new editions. The enemies are very predictable and once you know how they function you can use that to your advantage to take them out with the right weapon for the situation and avoid taking damage just like the originals. There are monster closets everywhere which open when you pick up a specific item and or walk past a specific point just like the originals. You move level to level just like in the originals.There are still key hunts and or the equivalent to key hunts. There are moments where it’s so dark that you can barely see anything just like in the originals. The game still has secrets and you can find some of the weapons earlier than you would usually find weapons just like in the originals and every old school shooter ever made. Differences: Having said that about darkness, doom 3 is very dark for most of the game, and you have to pull out a torch separately rather than having a torch tapped to a gun, this is one of the major criticisms of the game, I don’t have any issues with it, because it’s actually a lot better than the torch in the BFG edition where you can have a torch with another weapon however it’s too far to the left and it runs out of battery really quickly. You move a lot slower to a more realistic jog and running with a stamina bar whereas in the originals you move at 60mph all of the time.The enemy count is much sparser and the maximum amount of enemies you will usually have on screen at once is four to eight, whereas in doom 1 it was around fifth teen to twenty, and doom 2 it was around forty, though a lone enemy in doom 3 can be a lot more dangerous than a lone enemy in the originals. The levels themselves are a lot narrower than before though there are still some open areas here and there. Sometimes you might have an actual objective to complete and you sometimes come across NPCs and these sentry drones who fight alongside you. They have tried to have an actual plot but thankfully it’s pretty avoidable and ignorable, and at the end of the day it’s pretty much the same thing as the original plot, and there’s also an emphasis on finding codes for doors and storage cabinets. There is a focus on horror and some little scripted sequences but that thing is subjective from person to person. The weapon viability has also been changed around: The fists are just as a very last resort as before however the berserk power up is so rare you only come across it twice, the chainsaw is exactly the same, the torch is good against the unarmed zombies, the pistol is a last resort however unlike the originals it has perfect accuracy, unlike the first game where the shotgun is the go to gun most of the time since it has ridiculously good range and accuracy for a shotgun, the shotgun in doom 3 is only good to use at short to close range due to the large amount of spread, and it has a lower rate of fire, this gun is good to use against the weaker enemies such as the first game. (People complain that the shotgun is really overpowered in doom 3 however it’s the same as the first game in the sense that all of the enemies that can die in one hit in doom 3 can die in one hit in the originals) The machinegun is good for the medium enemies at for when the enemies are at a longer range. The minigun is a heavy weapon this time around and it is good for the heavy enemies and just any enemies though I find myself using it on the heavy enemies when they are too close for the rocket launcher. The grenades are almost useless since they bounce around too much. The plasma guns role is unchanged from the originals. The rocket launcher is good for the heavier enemies and boss fights, and finally the BFG…sadly I only find myself using it twice which are for two different boss fights, whereas in the doom 2 it is very useful for taking out a group of enemies and enemies you want to kill as quickly as possible.  If there’s one problem with Doom 3 it’s that you can’t switch weapons when you reload, that doesn’t sound like much and it also happens in a few other games as well, but in this it means the difference between life and death because you’ll have three or four enemies rushing at you and there’s nothing you can do about it because you are stuck in a reload animation. Don't get the bfg edition, because it ruins a lot of things in the game: it's far too bright so it basically turns down the atmosphere, there is a crappy torch that you can now use and have a gun out at the same time but it is too far to the left and runs out of battery too quickly, and it's supposed to be a HD re-mastered version of the game and it doesn't look any different, and it is very dumbed down and made far too easy to the point where the explosive barrels do ♥♥♥♥ all, there are too much health and ammo pickups lying around, the enemies do far less damage, and in the expansion pack there's even one section that was removed from the game! (That being that large room with all of the pillars and enemies in hell) Be sure to get the original version.I love this game as much as the originals though doom 2 is my favourite, this is really one of those games where you have to try it for yourself because of how polarising it is.

												I admit that I'm one of the many who gave this game all kinds of hate eversince I played it for the first time. I can't say it's completely my fault since the game does leave a terrible first impression with it's extremely slow pace and stupid scripted events. It's not until about 3 or 4 hours into the game that this game becomes Doom. I bought this game cheap on sale and decided to give it another go since playing it for the first time on the original XBOX. The game makes you think that all you're going to get is a little action in between reading emails, listening to logs, waiting through cutscenes. Well I'm glad to say that you won't. Collect all the PDAs you can find and just scan the emails to see if you can get codes to the weapon lockers so you can stay well stocked on ammo. Other than that you can pretty much ignore everything else. By the time you reach the end of this game you will know that you've played Doom. No, you don't flip a switch or collect a key to open up multiple closets full of enemies, but enemies do spawn all around you and will cut you down quickly if you don't dispatch them quick enough and strategize your reloads well. If you're a fan of Doom, you should play this game.			"

												You'll find out very fast that this doesn't play like a regular Doom game but it is one of my all time favorite games and I recommend you pick it up. You still have somewhat of that mindless shooter feel along with a very involving story. Being a game from 2004 the graphics are extremely good, and then there is the BFG edition release in 2012 that remastered this game. How I see Doom 3 compared to other people? You get all your original guns from Doom back in 1993, and all of the classic monsters making this story driven game so much fun. I had legit cried when I first beat it.			"

												Despite its somewhat underwhelming reputation I couldn't love this game more.Its true the game has more than its fair share of dark spots, but, well... I call myself a cat I guess darkness is kinda my thing. :P  I actually really like the infamous flashlight mechanic, it adds tension and fear to environments that wouldn't be particularly scary -- and in the BFG edition where that mechanic is removed, they aren't.The combat is fun and fast-paced, if a bit repetitive, but the variety with certain monsters like Arch-Viles takes some of the repetitiveness out of it once you get deep into the campaign.  The boss fights are really fun with unique mechanics except, somewhat, for the last one -- and they strike a good balance when it comes to difficulty: you'll finish them without much health left but you probably won't die so much it gets frustrating.  Hard mode is very fun as it's not about hiding or taking cover -- the way the monsters spawn you have to be pretty ferocious in order to survive.Map design is actually not too linear, which is a good thing to see in a game even as old as 2004... levels are maze-like without being confusing, and there's a decent variation in texture and structure schemes especially toward the end of the game -- although that part could still be improved somewhat.  Coming to this as I did about 8 years after it was released this type of level design was like a breath of fresh air.Graphics are still beautiful even 12 years later, the monsters and especially boss designs are grotesque and disturbing, they really feel like they could be demons out of some hell.There are a few minor quibbles I have -- just a few straighforward ones, and one or two weird ones...In a 27-level campaign, a lot of the monsters only appear for three or four levels or stop appearing altogether just after the mid-point.  This seems to especially happen to the most interesting designs like a literal baby insect, the (somewhat) classic lost soul, and the... Mancubus... thing...  Even the ubiquitous Pinky Demon from the original games kinda disappears after the fifteenth map or so.  There are plenty of other monsters that appear later on but it would have been nice to see some demons from the earlier maps stick around especially when enemy variety is one of the game's strong points.The weapons tend to be kinda same-ish although there's still enough variety to go around and enough situations where you do want to switch from one to the other.  You do have a bloody chainsaw if you get bored and it works well on even some of the high-level monsters like Arch-Viles, but the weapons are still a weak point.  I find myself mostly using the shotgun even when another weapon would work just as well -- it seems even limiting the amount of shotgun ammo you can find or carry (there doesn't seem to be any maximum, or if there is it's so high I've never reached it) would have gone a long way towards resolving this.  Its ammo does get more scarce towards the end of the game but so does the ammo for everything else, leaving you in the same situation.Finally -- and this is the weird one -- some of the monster sounds are distorted samples taken from tiger calls.  I spend a decent amount of time around tigers and these calls are, quite clearly, ""chuffs"" (a kind of purr) and mating calls.  I guess Pinky's a succubus now? :P  It can get pretty hard to take a hellish monster seriously when it's literally purring at you.Interestingly enough, the gameplay isn't the only place you can find big cat sounds in this game...All in all this is a great game, with a lot of custom content as well that I haven't gone into here just 'cuz I've already been talking long enough.  An underrated classic, I highly recommend giving it a look if all you've heard is its reputation for dark spaces and a weird flashlight.			"

												  Almost equal part survival horror game and shooter, Doom 3 is a departure from the original classics. Blaring MIDI metal and full speed circle strafing gives way to silence and methodically checking every corner for monsters. The story is surprisingly lengthy and involved, taking inspiration from the Alien films with a demonic Starship Troopers B-movie vibe. It was somewhat divisive when it originally released; the slower pace and heavy reliance on light management wasn't helped by the concurrent rise of the vocal, entitled, forum-dwelling “gamer” that was adverse to change of any kind. This backlash quickly led to a popular “flashlight mod” for the game; a cheat that bypassed the need to switch from your weapon to your light source and completely changed the nature of play. Once this “fix” was in circulation and accepted as a superior way to play the game, subsequent releases (the BFG Edition) used it as a new standard with no option to experience the game as originally intended. A decade later, it's pretty clear those people were wrong. The BFG Edition of Doom 3 is a fairly forgettable corridor shooter. This true version of Doom 3 is still fantastic and is much more influential than anyone seems to give it credit for.  Lighting is a central mechanic to Doom 3. While some of the character models and textures are starting to show their age, the lighting effects and art direction are still incredibly impressive. You use the “F” key to switch to your flashlight frequently; much of the game is filled with moody shadows and often complete pitch blackness. It's not uncommon to have to make a choice to either aim for a demon's glowing red eyes or lure it toward a more helpful light source, hoping you don't back into a trap in the process. It's ballsy how willing Doom 3 is to engulf the player in darkness, knowing their choice is to either be able to see or defend themselves. You can't do both. Walking through hostile environments armed with only a flashlight is it's own genre now; Outlast, Slender Man, Alien: Isolation... that disempowerment was a cornerstone of Doom 3.  Most of the weapons and enemies from the previous games return: the possessed soldiers, the standard Imps, floating Cacodemons, dead-raising Revenants, towering Hellknights, and the big bad Cyberdemon. A few new ones make their appearances, notably the weak but swarming spiders and creepy winged baby things. Then there are standard zombies, which aren't much of a threat on their own but have a habit of trapping you in corners if you're not careful. They're also great chainsaw fodder. Weapons include the all-around handy shotgun, the hammering chaingun, plasma gun, a new standard if generic assault rifle, and the legendary BFG. Ammo conservation and choosing the right tool for the right situation seems more vital than ever, as weapons have a pretty clear rock-paper-scissors relationship to most monsters. And the monsters can be right aggressive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, relentlessly chasing you down and teleporting toward or behind you. Some attacks and scripted “jump scares” seem almost impossible to avoid damage from, causing health and ammo rationing to ratchet up to true survival horror levels. Also new (though introduced late in the game) is the Soul Cube, an alien artifact that charges up by killing five enemies, which can then be thrown for massive damage and health regeneration. It's an odd weapon, but it does add an additional layer of strategy as you prioritize low ranking demons for the charge to obliterate the tougher foes.  A gripping narrative and the Doom name doesn't exactly go hand-in-hand, but a surprising amount of care went into building the game's lore and the pacing is actually spot on. You play The Marine, a voiceless guy who shows up on a Mars base in the future. Almost immediately ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan and the base's personnel gets a bad case of the Satans and demons start coming through portals. There's a mad scientist intent on helping the demons (or something), and the demons want to ultimately conquer Earth because they're actually an ancient race that humans have descended from. It's real campy schlock, but it's very self aware and dips into outright comedy at times, then presents truly dark and disturbing imagery in the next beat. I'd describe the tone as The Evil Dead meets Aliens.  You interact with the environments in a number of ways to solve puzzles; many of the computers can be cursored over in order to raise bridges, move machinery, or access camera or communication feeds. It's quite an impressive level of detail, mechanics that predated modern games like SOMA, Dead Space, and Alien: Isolation (again...). In addition to the standard finding of keycards and badges to raise your security clearance and unlock doors, Doom 3 features another form of storytelling collectible that has become prolific enough to become a cliché: audio logs and e-mails. Now, this certainly isn't the first video game to have the player sift through characters' personal files, but the game came out well before the method had overstayed it's welcome and is still some of the best implementation I've come across. Some of the exchanges between staff are genuinely funny, and the Martian Buddy spam is a forgotten classic. Even the video discs have a distinct style and personality, and even if some of this fluff can be criticized for slowing the game down, it's optional and I enjoyed diving into every last one. It can't be understated how great (and often tense) it is to be able to listen to audio logs as you explore and fight; something other games still screw up to this day.  Doom 3 holds up better than just about any other game of it's vintage I can think of. It remains super tense and oppressive, and I found myself leaning toward the screen as I played with baited breath. With a good pair of headphones and a darkened room it's just as effective (if not more so) than most modern horror games. When the bullets and fireballs start flying it's still definitely classic Doom, but the new emphasis on narrative and lore-building allow the masterfully crafted, cramped hellish battlefields to legitimately scare the crap out of you.

												You battle your way through dark corridors, blood soaked rooms and Martian terrain killing zombies, fire imps and all sorts of strange creatures. I suppose you can say Doom 3 is not an 'original' game in its ideas, but that won’t bother you once you get totally absorbed into it's environment. Like the original Doom, it has the end of level 'bosses' and you get all the good weapons right until the end when you have to battle the infamous Cyberdemon.The look of the game is amazing, with fantastic light and shadows (rather more of the latter than former) and innovative use of interactive computer screens. The sound is close to perfect.The atmosphere of the game is unparalleled, keeping you permanently alert. The few scenarios where the game uses psychological horror are very effective.On the other hand, the game sometimes gets repetitive. Although most of the game manages to hold your interest, there seems to be a lot of ""filler"" missions reminiscent of older id titles: get key to open door / find an access code / etc. This is particularly the case in the middle of the game when, after an impressive beginning, you begin to feel that the game ought to advance the plot a bit or give you something else to do rather than shooting imps and wandering some uninspired corridors. It does eventually liven up a bit, but the game would be much improved by some more variety.Some of the combat is also unfair, with monsters teleporting directly behind you. This can get annoying, but doesn't harm the horror aspect of the game at all as it keeps you permanently on edge.Overall, a rather unique game which is well worth playing.  "

												One of my favorite games of all time! However, this game is not without it's caveats, the main one being the lack of basic equipment on a futuristic colony on Mars.You mean to tell me that over a hundred years into the future, combat marines will be left running around in the dark without night vision goggles or even a $5 headlamp? All you have is an old Mag light that you have to switch back and forth from your weapons meaning you can not protect yourself with a gun and defend yourself at the same time. This makes no sense, why doesn't the main protagonist just duct tape the flashlight to his rifle, do they not have duct tape in the 22nd century? This problem was so bad I hear someone online even made a patch specifically to fix this problem where it makes the flashlight work even when you are holding a weapon. Despite it's problems, it's still a great game and a must play for any FPS fan.			"

												DOOM 3 is a FPS that isn't quite the same as its predecessors, but it's good in its on unique way. DOOM 3 employs more darker levels, horror and fear tactics (enemies popping out from hidden walls or teleporting around you) which works very well. The graphics and attention to detail all look great and the level designs are a lot tighter and have the player traversing through a lot of hallways and corridors. The campaign is ~8-10 hours long so it's a lot longer than most campaigns. During the middle it becomes a little repetitive as you constantly have to find PDAs or some item before you can open a door but then near the end the game really kicks into another gear and ends on a high note. DOOM 3 is a solid FPS shooter that also may have the player jump out of the seat once or twice!			"

												Imps.You turn the corner and there is a imp.They are never that big of a deal, yet the game loves to spam one or three every room.Too many imps.While not as good as the 2016 DOOM, D3 is a rather nice game, filled with demons and very tedious Imps.When I first heard of this game being too dark I thought it was a joke. Turns out about a chunk of all the rooms are almost pitch black, leading to some decent ambushes. The game is very linear, with a few off side areas for ammo or health. Great game if you want to try out the DOOM games without being overwhelmed by it's fast combat.			"

												Doom 3 honestly really disappointed me. It’s pretty technically sound; the graphics hold up well, the lighting is great, and the sound design while nothing really  special gets the job done. Doom 3 fails in the fact that is sticks to one formula that gets stale by around half way through the game. The game pushes itself as horror; nothing wrong with that of course. However Doom 3 tries the same tactics throughout the whole game. It pushes the same scares, the same enemies (which once you figure out there patterns there total pushovers), and the same dark industrial environment that looks exactly the same as the rest of the game. All these things stop being scary and start being annoying. This wouldn’t be so much of a problem if the staleness was only related to the scares. Unfortunately it affects the combat as well. Due to the cramped environments you will only ever be fighting a few enemies at time very rarely having the environments open up that much. This leads the game to never really get that much harder while also making every combat encounter feel samey. The game is entirely to long as well, even if the other reasons weren’t a problem it feels like it skips over its natural concluding point by at least a few hours. Overall Doom 3 is a game that overstays its welcome, it’s unwillingness to mix things up leads to a repetitive and boring experience "

												Doom 3 was a hit when it came out and is an absolutely necessary game to play if you are a fan of the original doom series.  There are pros and cons, however, to this game.  It seems that id tried harder to create a horror game than an action game.  The original Doom games were screens filled with enemies to take out with over the top action.  Here the action is still over the top, but you fight against a maximum of 5 creates at a time at the most, and not screens full of enemies.  This changes the pace of the game and lowers the bar for the action a bit.  Also, by trying to make it scary, the levels are very dark.  This is too bad because the graphics are beautiful, but hard to see when the lighting is so low.  I would say though that the graphics compared to Source didn't age as well when compared to today's graphic abilities.However, this is still Doom.  This is still a game of kill or be killed and you are still a bad ♥♥♥ with a gun.  All of the old guns come back from the previous games and they feel great.  The levels are corridor levels, and not open areas, but that helps with making this more of a horror game.  The sounds are good and the music is pretty much the same as quake with a heavy metal focus.Do I like this game better than I loved the original Doom, no.  But I can't not recommend this game, as the graphics and its brand name set a standard that all other games of the future look to copy or surpass.  id did not make the impact with Doom 3 as they did with the original Doom, but this is still worth your time playing.

												Conclusion: Get the BFG EditionThis game was probably epic when it came out in 2004. But for me who just tried it out I'm not very happy about it. I just tried out Doom 1 and Doom 2 (yes I am a bit late to the party), but those games were epic, fun and challenging in a good way.Doom 3 just changes too much from the original formula - and not for the better (which is confirmed by the fact that the new Doom (doom reboot?) basically went back to the old formula and turned it up to 11. Gone are the open ""mini-arenas"" where you fight hordes of enemies; difficult at times, but fair in the sense that you outrun the enemies and can take cover. Doom 3, on the other hand, just throws you into a narrow corridor, spawning enemies infront and behind you with no possibility for mobility and calls that fair?!?. And so far, the game has not been difficult for any other reason than that you can not see your targets. That is the main killer for me with this game. So many times I've died not because the enemy would be particulary difficult to kill in itself, but when you get 0 vision, you can't aim. And that's where the BFG Edition comes in: It has a modern system with tac-lights strapped onto your gun (or yourself, whichever) and makes the game playable.So yeah, stay away from the vanilla version and get the proper game. I'm not gonna write a more in-depth review here, since I'm moving over to the BFG edition and will review that instead.			"

												Most of my playtime with Doom 3 has been with ye ol' CD ROM version. So my Steam stats aren't a good reflection.PROS:+ Action, and plenty of it.+ Atmosphere. Excellent use of lighting, sounds, and jump scares.+ Very fluid controls.+ Modest hardware requirements. Anything built after 2006 should be able to run Doom 3.+ Killer mods. Modding community continues to add cool stuff to Doom 3.+ Solid multiplayer.+ A steal at only $10, and often on sale for even less.CONS:- 6th generation (PS2/original Xbox) graphics. Graphics snobs are probably going to gripe.			"

												This game, believe it or not, is a decade old.  Even with that considered, it still looks pretty decent to this day.  I highly recommend this game over the new BFG version for a number of reasons both subjective and objective.The objective reason is obvious, that being that sikk mod (may be wrong spelling), along with the wolfsomething texture pack make it look even better than the BFG edition.   The rest is subjective.  I have heard and seen play throughs of the new lost mission in the BFG edition.  Not only does it make no sense along the lines of Aliens Colonial Marines with Michael Bean still being alive, but the levels are not very compelling.Overall if you can get the origional with the classic flashlight with no gun I suggest playing this game on hard, without the ducktape mod.  The game was designed with this as a game mechanic even though, from what I have heard it was a technical compromise.  One interesting thing about the new BFG version with the suit flashlight is that there are no shadows.  Where as with the hand held flashlight there are.  Carmack evidently wanted flashlight design to go in one direction while the industry took another.  This is why for those of you who played quake 4, using the same engine, you can see your allied NPcs flashlights, but in left 4 dead you cannot.  Back to the game and less about tech history. This game has good graphics even without mods.  It was one of those games that when it came out was hands down the best looking thing out on the market.  If your keen about moding, I mentioned a really good texture pack above.  The game has a nice variety of enemies and guns.  This is a game back in the days where you did not need 10 smgs, 10 asault rifles, and so on.  You get your standard shotgun, machine gun, plasma gun, and BFG!!!  Despite people calling most enemies idiots you will die a few times on hard so save often.  There is some strategy such as with the tentecal commando.  Knowing to let him run up to you and duck, shoot, stand, shoot in the face is a hard but excellent tactic. (timing wise you can mess up and die real fast)  Also start the game on hard.  Any horror game (im not saying this is survival horror, but it applies to that as well) should in my humble opinion be played on the hardest difficulty available, in the dark, and with a headset.  As scary as the artwork or demonic base can get, its not very scary if your enemies are a joke.  Since there is no regenerating health you will find yourself with 32 hp on many occasions, one hit away from death from a hard ememy.  Thats tension baby!Also while this is entirely up to you, I must say playing with the basic flashlight design really makes or breaks the game for me.  Having played it with both, I cannot stress how there is worse lighting and less tension.  Yes I know a flashlight is one of the basic attachments to any gun and it makes no sense, but we are playing a game about demons from hell.  The flashlight leaves you vulnerable and makes you slowly explore rooms until hell breaks loose.  Also slowing down allows you to hear enemies hiding.  Ive often used the tactic of fill the room with grenades and then enter (Careful those things love to blow you up).  The game does have monster closets, and while cheap, they do scare you and I honestly hated them in 2004, but really came to like them when I replayed recently.  In the end its your choice about the flashlight, just know it will change the game experience.Multiplayer is dead so your getting this for the singleplayer.  Overall its a nice scary walk through time.  Hope this was helpful, if not let me know why so I can improve.   "

												DOOM 3 wowed me when I was a child and when it first came out. I remember having to see this at my friends house and was completely spooked by the visuals and how it can make the game scary. While modern game mechanics and technology kinda did make the game look dated now, I still think this is a great game and an amazing visual piece to play. The horror in the game works, most of the guns felt awesome to use and the enemies out right terrifying and hard to take down. Though the story, which they tried to add a story to the game, doesn't feel amazing and kinda silly, I still recommend this game. HOWEVER, I do not recommend Resurrection of Evil's Campaign because I felt the campaign was a bloody mess and was out right terrible. Me and my friend played the whole game in coop with a mod for both the base and the expansion and we both agree that Resurrection of Evil was a crappy expansion.			"

It was way ahead of its time with the monster behaviour displayed with in the game and has cutting edge high res graffics that hold up against the tides of time quite well.

Sure Far cry was innovative in its time, it was one of the first open world attempts and it was generally not recognised as a good game until years later in which I still don't find attractive...Play this game and love it, but you won't need to play it more than once unless you're a fan such as myself. Great fun, good scares that get you jumping and great feeling shooting.			"

												An absolute classic. A must have for any FPS fan, it's awesome in 2 words: DOOM 3. Wait... one word and a number. WHO CARES ANYWAY, IT'S DOOM. GET IT NOW, YOU GREASY MONKEY.PS: Bugger the BFG Edition, just get this and pimp it out with FREE graphics/sound enhancement mods on the internet. Looks better than the BFG Edition with them anyway.			"

												Doom 3 doesnt really have an aweful lot in common with the originals, theres alot less swarms of evil dudes and a bit less gratification when you send a demon back to hell via your shotgun. That being said, Doom 3 accomplishes alot. It was way ahead of its time with the monster behaviour displayed with in the game and has cutting edge high res graffics that hold up against the tides of time quite well. (alot better then me anyways)I recommend doom as a terror / horror experience. although the 'ol Imp jumping out of a cupboard does get a little repetitive.			"

												This game, believe it or not, is a decade old.  Even with that considered, it still looks pretty decent to this day.  I highly recommend this game over the new BFG version for a number of reasons both subjective and objective.The objective reason is obvious, that being that sikk mod (may be wrong spelling), along with the wolfsomething texture pack make it look even better than the BFG edition.   The rest is subjective.  I have heard and seen play throughs of the new lost mission in the BFG edition.  Not only does it make no sense along the lines of Aliens Colonial Marines with Michael Bean still being alive, but the levels are not very compelling.Overall if you can get the origional with the classic flashlight with no gun I suggest playing this game on hard, without the ducktape mod.  The game was designed with this as a game mechanic even though, from what I have heard it was a technical compromise.  One interesting thing about the new BFG version with the suit flashlight is that there are no shadows.  Where as with the hand held flashlight there are.  Carmack evidently wanted flashlight design to go in one direction while the industry took another.  This is why for those of you who played quake 4, using the same engine, you can see your allied NPcs flashlights, but in left 4 dead you cannot.  Back to the game and less about tech history. This game has good graphics even without mods.  It was one of those games that when it came out was hands down the best looking thing out on the market.  If your keen about moding, I mentioned a really good texture pack above.  The game has a nice variety of enemies and guns.  This is a game back in the days where you did not need 10 smgs, 10 asault rifles, and so on.  You get your standard shotgun, machine gun, plasma gun, and BFG!!!  Despite people calling most enemies idiots you will die a few times on hard so save often.  There is some strategy such as with the tentecal commando.  Knowing to let him run up to you and duck, shoot, stand, shoot in the face is a hard but excellent tactic. (timing wise you can mess up and die real fast)  Also start the game on hard.  Any horror game (im not saying this is survival horror, but it applies to that as well) should in my humble opinion be played on the hardest difficulty available, in the dark, and with a headset.  As scary as the artwork or demonic base can get, its not very scary if your enemies are a joke.  Since there is no regenerating health you will find yourself with 32 hp on many occasions, one hit away from death from a hard ememy.  Thats tension baby!Also while this is entirely up to you, I must say playing with the basic flashlight design really makes or breaks the game for me.  Having played it with both, I cannot stress how there is worse lighting and less tension.  Yes I know a flashlight is one of the basic attachments to any gun and it makes no sense, but we are playing a game about demons from hell.  The flashlight leaves you vulnerable and makes you slowly explore rooms until hell breaks loose.  Also slowing down allows you to hear enemies hiding.  Ive often used the tactic of fill the room with grenades and then enter (Careful those things love to blow you up).  The game does have monster closets, and while cheap, they do scare you and I honestly hated them in 2004, but really came to like them when I replayed recently.  In the end its your choice about the flashlight, just know it will change the game experience.Multiplayer is dead so your getting this for the singleplayer.  Overall its a nice scary walk through time.  Hope this was helpful, if not let me know why so I can improve.   "

												DOOM 3 wowed me when I was a child and when it first came out. I remember having to see this at my friends house and was completely spooked by the visuals and how it can make the game scary. While modern game mechanics and technology kinda did make the game look dated now, I still think this is a great game and an amazing visual piece to play. The horror in the game works, most of the guns felt awesome to use and the enemies out right terrifying and hard to take down. Though the story, which they tried to add a story to the game, doesn't feel amazing and kinda silly, I still recommend this game. HOWEVER, I do not recommend Resurrection of Evil's Campaign because I felt the campaign was a bloody mess and was out right terrible. Me and my friend played the whole game in coop with a mod for both the base and the expansion and we both agree that Resurrection of Evil was a crappy expansion.			"

												DOOM 3 is a serviceable 2004 horror shooter that just happens to be a Doom game, for better and worse. It's not on the level of its forebears, but it's not terrible either. At the very least, download Killatomate's Realistic Weapons mod to make your firepower not garbage. Avoid the BFG Edition - it screws with gameplay balance, and is incompatible with mods, of which there's plenty to make OG look even better than BFG. (I didn't like the BFG ports of classic Doom either: they modify the games too much and run poorly.)So hey, this is still Doom, right? There's too much ammo and health lying around to really qualify Doom 3 as survival horror, so it must be. While I think the game could absolutely have used more open spaces, I don't mind the game mainly taking place in linear corridors because they are very good corridors.Lot of PDAs lying around to collect though, and only like two or three female characters in the entire game, so you know this is a 2004 product. The PDAs at least give the game an air of immersion and worldbuilding. It's a shame the game as linear as it is, since a branching plot point (an actual one) would have been a good gameplay point, not to mention a bit of a callback to the classics' level design.The aforementioned mod makes the guns actually fun to use instead of wet cardboard, to the point where I consider it a requirement since you happen to spend a lot of the game using them on the demons. Some of the guns still become superfluous after a while, since there's more of them here than in the original games. When you have a rocket launcher and grenades and a chaingun and an SMG, you tend to use what you feel like using. Meanwhile, the bigger problem with Doom 3's gameplay is that every other encounter is a cheap 'gotcha' or some sort of monster closet, most of which get predictable after a while. The originals did this too, but not nearly as much nor as egregiously.There's also a number of encounters with multiple little spider enemies crawling out of vents and such where all you do is just stand there and shoot them, which gets a little tedious. System Shock had respawning enemies, which would have been an interesting experiment with the Doom formula here and at the very least less annoying than a dozen spiders crawling one at a time out of a vent shaft.Don't get me wrong, this game builds enough tension that it can get away with jumpscares every so often, and it's not like they're the obnoxious full-screen ""find the hidden object"" type, but Silent Hill this ain't. While I would argue Doom 3 actually pulls off its horror much better than it does its terror, that doesn't excuse the entirely scripted monster closets getting old after a while. The lack of checkpoints means that if you're caught off-guard by one, you potentially get to replay the entire level as well.Doom 3's story is...well, it exists. For the most part, it doesn't detract from the game. You might wonder what Doom is doing with such an overt story, but really, iD couldn't not write one in 2004. Games had come a long way since 1993, and writing in games at the time was just starting to become more than a vestigial element. Of course, Doom 3 also came before the time when some people realized that while not every game needs a thin layer of contrived plot, games as a whole need good writing.In comparison, MachineGames' 2014 game Wolfenstein: The New Order (a continuation of iD's only shooter franchise older than Doom) has writing that adds to the game, and meanwhile the 2016 Doom reboot does a lot more than Doom 3 with less than what 3 has.Anyway. One of the two main problems here are the lack of sound effects in the audio logs, a problem I'll mention the System Shock games didn't have. The other is the fact that Dr. Betruger is by far the most corny, hokey, Snidely Whiplash-evil character in any FPS ever, and that's REALLY saying something.I don't even need to spoil the fact that he's evil because you see it coming from a mile away the moment you first see him. His name is literally German for 'betrayal'. He veers between creepy and funny nearly every time you hear him say you're DOOOOOMED!!! MUAHAHAHA!!! He's the one vestigal element Doom 3 would have been almost entirely better off without.This game was honestly never going to live up to the originals. Mainly because the originals were much more progressive and envelope-pushing at exactly the right time, and were much more flexible to boot, but also because they were products of the late stage of videogaming's 'childhood'.Doom 3, on the other hand, is a product of video gaming's adolescent period. It trades those gracefully aging MIDI riffs and pixels for surplus buckets of grimness and horror, a look that while probably very fluid and good for 2004, doesn't hold up that well today without mods. It's worth mentioning though that the game's code is very well-written, and that the most taxing element for 2004 PCs - the dynamic lighting engine - is still fairly impressive.Both of those accomplishments come with a caveat, however, in that the whole game could frankly be summed up as a long-form tech demo for the developers' id Tech 4 engine, which they later leased out to other developers. I will, at least, praise the interactive computer interfaces as being truly excellent and something I'd like to see more of today.Ultimately, if you're willing to put a little modding work into it and deal with the fact that, taking everything into account, this game is both lesser than and has aged more than the originals in its series, you will find a decent game.

Thing is I rented Doom 3 BFG edition and played through it and... despite the problems BFG edition had, I have to call this game a masterpiece. An absolute classic, holds up extremely well today, I recommend it fully. Just don't get BFG edition.			"

												Awesome atmospheric space horror FPS game and one of the scariest I have ever played (together with Dead Space), the darkness in it is literally unseen anywhere else and the feeling of despair totally gets you, needless to say you even visit Hell at some point.The variety of scary demons coming from Hell to halt your progress is impressive, but even more impressive is the variety of weapons you get to stop them: from classic pistols, shotguns and machine guns (with my favorite being the double-barreled shotgun, found only in the expansion, Resurrection of Evil, though) to awesome futuristic weapons like the Plasma Gun, Grabber Gun (again found only in the expansion) and my personal favorite: the Big ♥♥♥♥ing Gun or BFG, as it is commonly known!Unlike it's two predecessors, which were less scary and more fast-paced mindless shooters, Doom 3 inverted these two factors, resulting in a slower and scarier FPS game. While still remaining awesome, it is not for the everyone and especially the weak of heart.For a more hardcore and immersive experience you can also play it alone, in a dark and silent room, just remember to check your sanity once in a while!

												If you've ever played Doom, you know it's a fast-paced run and gun shooter. Doom 3 still is, but it is distinctly slower, putting more emphasis on atmosphere instead. The lighting engine was very advanced for the time and it really helps to set the mood when you see huge, menacing shadows fly by the walls cast by demons running through low angle lighting. That said, the whole game is dark. You get a flashlight, but you have to choose between equipping it or wielding a weapon. That fact has garnered a lot of flak for the game, but I didn't mind it. Forcing you to hold your flashlight at the cost of disarming yourself made simply walking down a corridor feel intense. The majority of the game takes place in a research facility on Mars, which grants a sense of isolation. You know that you and the few remaining personnel are on your own. Inside this facility, though are a bunch of tight corridors, and that's about it. Again, some people hate that, but to me claustrophobia is another plus factor to the atmosphere. The game is meant to be intense, even when nothing is going on, and the feeling of being trapped does just that.With the exception of reloading, the gunplay feels classic. You have to put a bunch of rounds into the enemies to kill them, and some of the larger enemies will require multiple reloads with smaller weapons. Circle strafing is a must in larger areas, but you'll have to do a lot of popping in and out of cover or tactically charge or retreat in most cases. It has the same sort of feel as Doom, just a bit modernized (for 2004) and stylized.The game has a few flaws, though, but they can mostly just be ignored. The AI is a little lackluster at times. There are small closet-sized rooms which serve simply to open silently behind you and release an enemy. The darkness might strain your eyes a bit, so playing for a couple hours might be a bit uncomfortable. To some, the gameplay might get repetitive. But for me, the strengths far outweighed these few weaknesses. This is definitely a recommend.			"

												So Steam Roulette selected DOOM3 to be game #2 of this year's Steam Backlog Blitz. At first I was kinda excited as I hadn't really touched DOOM3 since I bought x amount of years ago. I was recommended to download and use the sikkmod, which I too would recommend. Provides some nicely updated graphics and options to play around with. First thing I will say about this game is that it's long. Certainly long for a FPS, even more so compared to modern standards. You'll easily be playing this game for 12+ hours, which could be a good or a bad thing depending on what you like from a FPS. I personally found it a little too long, and according to Steam it took me 19 hours to finish this... It's a very slow paced game, which is odd for a DOOM title. Some might like that, but if you've grown up with DOOM and even DOOM II then it's a strange experience. They could easily have dropped a level or two from the middle of the game, or even had more 'traditional DOOM' levels as replacements. However, the slow pace of the game is highlighted nicely by the lighting and the sound within the game. I know some people didn't like the torch/weapon swapping, but I found it increased the level of tension within the game (however I did find it led to an increased level of bordem at times). Yet, the cheap scares and the over use of the one scare tactic do become tiresome very quickly. Overall it was an OK experience, if a little too long and not as frantic as I expected. Graphics, lighting and atmosphere are still good today as they would have been back in 2004. So credit must go to ID for that. If you play this in bitesized chunks you'll probably avoid the feeling of the game dragging on.If you see this cheap in the sales, have a good pair of headphones, and turn the lights off... you're in for a decent experience.

												This is a great game to play even if it doesn't stick to the original DOOM and DOOM 2 game. I had fun shooting and blowing up spawns of satin while experiencing some of the jumpscares DOOM 3 had to offer. Having access to every weapon instead of limiting it to two is always fun to expierece because the more the marrier. Weapon progression in this game is enjoyable making players start form a lonely pistol to a BFG that kills everything in front of you because BIG F****** GUN! thats why. The plot is not simplified like the earlier titles but is still good and allows players to make a choice, a small one at that, to  send out a distress beacan or not . This choice is very minor and only effects the cutscene at the end making replaying the game for that choice not a big priority. The end boss battle feels a bit underwelming though as the player does nothing but run in a circle and wait for an item to charge up just to use it on the boss repeatedly. Finding PDA's for lore and locker codes is a great implimentation because it makes players search around the area if they want the goodies locked in that locker. Enemy variasion is good making players change tactics to tackle certain foes and introducing them is good as well. Replaying the game to have fun or experience a harder difficulty is fun and enjoyable as the game itself I feel can be played multiple times and still be fun. I recommend playing this game with sikkmod as it makes a game from 2003 look not only good but play better and smoother. Playing this game without sikkmod is okay too but the player will have to moddify the game anyway as the in game settings dosen't support 1920 by 1080p resolution. Information on the sikkmod modification and resoulution fix can be found in the forums.			"

												Well although it's not as good as the first two games in series, Doom 3 is an awesome game. Its atmosphere is quite like in the older games, but with the new flashlight thing going on. Some people didn't like this feature, but for me, it was a good way to scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of me back when I first played it. The graphics were awesome back then and I still think they're gorgeous even on today's standards. The sound effects could be a little more ""brutal"". For exemple, the monster noises/ roars didn't sound like something that came directly from a hell portal, as the imp and hell knight's roar on Doom. Also the weapons didn't pack the punch like the chaingun or the shotgun on the older games. The shotgun shot noises just sound like an toy gun. And the gameplay although it's meant to be arcade like its predecessors, sometimes its dull. There are certain parts where monsters spawn exactly on the same place and if you die, you can just memorize when it'll come out and before the monster appears, you can just start to shoot on the spot to easily kill the monster.Aside from those little things, some small bugs and minor gameplay issues, I'd totally recommend it. Worth the time spent, I finished this game about 4-5 times or more. Also check for the hi-res modes on google, they're better than the BFG version.			"

												Heyyo, This game is badass. The campaign is linear yes... but the action is awesome in-your-face spook moments much like F.E.A.R. emulated in their own game... This game also had incredible graphics for its time and they still look nice too.DON'T even bother trying Multiplayer. The netcode in ID Tech 5 is so incredibly bad? That even though servers are a max of 4 players, it lags insanely. It's definitely the worst reason to try this game... albeit the ""Last Man Standing"" co-op mod is plenty fun though. ;)There is also a great mod community for this game which you can find Doom 1 and 2 remakes... plus a Hexen mod! :)			"

It is admittedly a very linear, setpiece-corridor sort of game full of formulaic jump-scares, but... It feels really well made and good. Everythings well executed and to my surprise it did actually have the feel of a classic doom game. It coulda done with more variation, but.. yeah.

												It's Doom. Demons, aliens, Mars, Hell, and (not quite enough time spent with) the BFG9000. The game spends a little too much time on the theme of survival horror, a few too many zombies in dark corners, jump scares, unlit areas, enemy-spawns-behind-you and all that. Though it is definitely fun to play alone in the dark at night and come across that one area every now and you're so hesitant to proceed, you feel like you yourself are in danger. But it retains the over all theme of the franchise with Hell and aliens and it's a very fun game over all that has aged very gracefully.Pros: Terrifying to play in the darkI never get tired of fighting ImpsStill has great graphics, lighting and animationsGreat sound as well(with a couple exceptions) awesome re-designs of the classic enemiesA fairly challenging gameBFG!!!Cons: Too much wandering through the dark/too many jump scaresNot as high octane as the original gamesNot enough BFG!!!It's a classic game in it's own right.

												Doom 3 is a long-awaited game of Doom franchise, a dark first-person shooter and sequel to icon of FPS games. It was developed and released by id Software in 2004, after few delays and annual showcases at E3, with one of those alpha versions of a game ending up leaked. It differs in that it takes more on slower survival horror side while still remaining an old-school shooter. Even if very slow one.It also got remade/remastered as part of BFG Edition deal, where it was brightened up, eliminating darkness aspect of gameplay. If you are one of those people who agree with joke that to copy Doom 3 gameplay you just have to turn off monitor screen and then direct flashlight at it, then you better check that version out instead.It also was ported to Xbox. Sure thing it was cut down and simplicifed, but overall stayed true to the source. Didn't play it myself. One nice feature it had over PC version was 2-player coop, with levels being edited to fit into such gameplay. But since Xbox Live service was shut down it's not actual anymore. Sadly.And so after launching the game and choosing ultra-quality, while laughing as I remember my old PC back few years ago struggling with low-quality setting and even freezing, I started a new game. And was awed. By how much more ugly it was compared to clean image I had in my memories.You see, the game fails to recognise memory amount on modern hardware correctly and so it sets the textures quality to the minimum. Tweaking settings in-game will not change it. Instead you have to go to game folder and edit config file. I recommend looking at PCGamingWiki site which has a good example of Autoexec file.But the small graphical problems still remained. Perhaps it's because I tweaked config files manually, but I had a few glitches. First, corpses of non-demons (and spiders) behaved funnily when gibbed. They would start dissintegrating, then when almost finished they would suddenly go back to look same as before, just without heads, and then they just suddenly dissapear few seconds later.Another rendering problem would occur after getting to the next level during gameplay, where lights/shadows will start to slowly glitch out slightly here and there. Got tiresome to restart the game after few levels. Some on other hand were complained about objects fully dissapearing, so watch out.And strangely enough game stutters here and there even on modern hardware. Some blame Steam version.Nope, no widescreen by default. But people would just tweak config file and I never heard any complaining. Didn't check myself.Multiplayer community is pretty much dead, I didn't find anybody playing game. Aside from that one time where they were playing on server with some mod, but I failed to join. So I don't have vanilla experience. From what I can tell multiplayer was pretty much tucked on the game, it being a small-scaled deathmatch, with 4 players limit. Things move fast though and even keeps same shadow play as single-player game. Still, I doubt that it was all that hot.Community made a coop mod, by the way, maybe it's worth checking out with a friend.Plot follows a lone space marine, who is not same guy as that Doom guy from original. And you are this time on Mars, where UA Corporations is having teleporter experiements, with half of a staff having asian look. After a short introudction levels, hell will break loose.And so Doom 3, while keeping arsenal fo weapons and monster types recognisable from the original Doom games, albeit with style change, leans onto more of Survival Horror aspect. Now, mind it, it still has you run'n'gunning. Well, walk'n'gunning, as the game became much more slower-paced. You will walk slower and you will encounter far lesser enemies, somewhere like Quake 1. Which means less but a bit tougher. You will also have monsters ambushing you often, pouncing at you as soon as door opens and test your reaction like that, as well as just spawning into room. Spawn takes ages however and by the time that monster will actually teleport in you will be already aiming your shotgun up-close at the main mass.Yes, it has design hiccups. But it does excells in atmoshpere and one of the main unique things it brings in is light/shadow play. As you know, engine blew everybody mind, at least in 2002 E3 event, with combination of bump-mapping and dynamic shadows, with shadow rendering the same no matter if it's level or model. While being sexily precise. While other games in the end would just put it in for farts, Doom 3 used it to enhance the style and gameplay. And boy, does it look still awesome. Not as pretty as Half-Life 2, mind it, but I really wanted to screenshot occasional room, seeing how all the monsters, bump-shaded sci-fi textures and action is illuminated. Shame that screenshot function on Steam overlay was disabled.It also bring a thing or two in gameplay. Darkness is often covering parts of a room. You can either hold a flashlight or use a weapon, never both. As a result, you have to decide if you want to see where monster is or just shoot blindly. Actually, I pretty much recommend you to use flashlight as little as possible and never in a firefight. This way you will actually will be more effective, as you will learn to recognise monsters by the little lights they give away, whether fireballs or just their eyes, as well as recognising that monster is there by sounds they make. Most memoriable scene for me was after imp, fireball throwing medium demon, killed the only light in a room and two more arrived soon, as I had to tell away where they were by the light that their fireballs emitted.No other FPS would combine both old-school shooting and survival horror aspect this way.Well, if forget that for survival horror it gives way too much ammo. Or even for standard FPS. That, or maybe that's because I opened every closet. You see, game placed a lot of devices around the levels that would show you email and audio log of some person. They are mostly there to improve backstory. And to reward players who read them developers would put closet codes into logs too. But to be honest, while amusing, they weren't exciting and it only putted away players who didn't care about those things.Was quite easy on Normal too. Should had increased difficulty. Hmmm.Also, two lockers want you to check easter egg websites that actually was on Internet. If forget that it not redirects you to Doom3BFG site. Just search through some easter eggs website.And yes, it tries to scare player all the time. And to be honest, it doesn't work. Not even as jumpscares. Or maybe it wasn't intented to be truly scary. In all honesty I just recommend to immerse yourself into atmoshpere and enjoy all the freaky stuff going on, taking it as a just cool special effect. Relax and enjoy.Game also doesn't use music tracks, instead putting combination of ambient sound into every room. Some of those sounds were quite musical. It was a good experiement idea, but fails in this case, as I don't remember anything good. But I guess it works. Could use proper ambient track though.It still is clunky at times, gameplay isn't as smooth as in original Doom. For example Shotgun isn't all that reliable, it can shoot in such way that every pellet will be outside of a center. Or focused on one side. Most of encounters don't last long. Melee zombies are just there to be beaten up by flashlight. It also overuses futurustic base setting, only once breaking into Hell level or such. Now, I loved taking slow and being careful in these dark rooms of UAC base, but even I grew tired toward the end. That and final boss sucks.And well, it's plainly way too long for what it is.But in the end, Doom 3 still manages to fill the niche. But you gotta love slow-paced actiony gameplay and to appericate some shadow work. Even if it's not 2004 anymore, it still looks nice too. And just have to be in the mood to love it.			"

												Despite the facts that there were some certain flaws in the game (i.e. no military nightvision, no flashlight on weapons, overused horror cliches, etc.), those flaws do make the good parts of Doom 3 all the more better, specifically that the Doom 3 has its own level of challenge, especially when fighting in the dark. Not only that, but Doom 3 is modular! You can make custom maps and stuff to play Doom 3 in. While the BFG edition is a lot more graphically better, you can get a mod for this original version that will match it or even outbest it (Not that I'm trying to put down the BFG edition, of course.)Also, let's not forget the Nightmare difficulty, which introduces a degenerating health system that won't kill you, but makes you so weak as in a single hit from almost any enemy can be enough to kill you.A 2004 classic to love!

												So Doom 3, the whole no flashlight on gun idea is original but quite annoying, and the one time you want a flashlight u lose it to a plot twist...sigh Gameplay is unique a first but you will hate the waves after a bit, bosses are unique and have interesting patterns/attacks., but after acquiring one item you can make it cakewalk The BFG is trash... overcharged it so many times. Ammo/Health packs etc seem to be fair and balanced, never starve for too long. The only down side to doom 3 is that the scariest parts are fatties with wrenches. Recommended if it goes around 5 dollars or less.			"

												Doom3: A fun run on a space station. The game is pretty good, I tend to enjoy the interactive ingame screens and the audio logs; these were new concepts at the time. However the areas look so similar it gets monotonous just trying to run through the level. They also try to scare you relentlessly with voices and things poping around. This game just lacks the complexity and level design compared to halflife 2.			"

												Although this game by itself is good enough to be considered a pretty nice game, it lacks of the DOOM essence first introduced with Knee-Deep in the Dead. The gameplay is not as linear as the older ones, and it is full of reading and cinematics. Nothing more boring in a DOOM game if you ask me.However, the value of this game is not within the game itself, but within its engine and source code. Many modders have made a wonderful job creating new content for this engine. And one of the best of them is a recreation of the first installment of DOOM, Knee-Deep in the Dead, brought up-to-date with modern effects, AI, sounds and triggers!You can see it by yourself:

And you can grab it from here: http://www.moddb.com/mods/classic-doom-3This mod is the reason I bought this game on Steam. This mod is everything I hold dear in this good Earth (or this good Mars?). BFG edition won't allow mods, so this installment, rather cheap, is a must-have for every DOOM fan, because that mod is pure dynamite and worth its source code lenght in diamonds.			"

												The original overrated monster closet game.Doom 3 has been widely hailed as one of the scariest games ever made, presumably by the sort of people who think all it takes to file a movie under the horror genre is the presence of a monster and maybe turning a few lights off. Doom 3 is little more than Baby's First Dead Space, and while that's a little bit unfair as it obviously came well before its most obvious imitator, it isn't even remotely scary and is barely passable as a shooter.Let me start by approaching the horror half the of the equation: the primary emotion that horror feeds on is fear. Fear stems from vulnerability. Now, how can one possibly feel vulnerable while packing more firepower than a Texan wedding, up to and including two different instant-kill weapons? By far the most reliably lethal thing in the game was the bloody level design, between its clumsy platforming and occasionally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t set design (Oh, you shot this fragile glass fuel pipe in the midst of a close-quarters firefight? Enjoy instant vaporization, sucker). Meanwhile, the atmosphere the game attempted to set up was about as scary as Halloween decorations, so if you have a phobia of red color filters and balding middle-aged men laughing at you over the intercom, I suppose you might get a few frights out of it.As for the shooting... it's just not Doom. Every Doom game before or since has been high-octane shooty-bang action characterized by constant movement and overwhelming firepower on both sides. What it is NOT, is clomping down tight corridors with all the lights off fighting half a dozen enemies at a time - tops - while the lackluster sound design robs you of any situational awareness so the game can 'scare' you with some zombie twatbasket smacking you on the back of your head because somehow a trained marine can't pick up on an obese corpse shambling up behind him on noisy grate floors.I haven't played the Resurrection of Evil expansion yet, but I'll review that seperately when I do. As for Doom 3 itself, I'd rather just play Dead Space again. Or that System Shock remake, when that comes out.			"

												Doom 3 is slower-paced than Doom 2; has worse level design than Doom 2; is less immersive than Doom 2 (stop pulling the camera away from first-person you ♥♥♥♥♥); has messy convoluted objectives whereas Doom 2 had the perfectly substantial 'find the exit'. Also, why the hell did they give the protagonist such an irritating voice, or one at all for that matter?Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised by Doom 3. I was expecting it to be worse than the classic Doom games that we're all so fond of -- and in the aforementioned ways it certainly is -- but overall it turned out to simply be different to them.The old formula is still here: get from A to B, shoot the monsters between you and B, pick up armour, health and ammo along the way. The gameplay hasn't been changed into dull survival horror or cover-based shooting or anything modern and awful like that. It's just been slowed down a tad and made a bit scarier and more realistic, and for many people that'll definitely be a good thing. On top of that, Doom 3 obviously has far better visuals than the old games in both realism and artistic prowess. Pretty demons are always more fun to shoot than ugly ones.So even if you love Dooms 1 & 2 and are terrified of change, I'd say there's a good chance you'll still love the shiny latest addition to the family. You just won't love it for quite the same reasons.			"

												I literally s*** my pants.First corner I turned to find an imp on all fours, coiled and ready to strike a split second after making eye contact, I ruined my first pair of pants in years. Don't get me wrong, I foolishly put my trust in a treacherous fart every now and again. But this was complete Chocolate Chernobyl. I haven't done that since I was 25 or so when a bunch of bacon exploded while I was cooking. Luckily for my denim leggings of Levi, they weren't equipped at the moment. My +3 sword of bad ideas and sack of scratching though...Anyway, here are the pros and cons of this game:Pros:1. AMAZING graphics for the age of this game. Mods out there still available to make them even better. JUST READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!!! (Or your game will look like Doom on the SNES with a bad Game Genie code.)2. Great mesh of HOLY F****** S*** swarms and ""didn't I just pee ten minutes ago?"" suspense.3. Actually has a plot. Kind of. I dug it. If you don't like it then you're mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries. Read the Doom books too. They're not terrible like everyone says in the reviews.4. Better than the BFG edition. You can actually find mods for this version. Play them both and you'll find more differences that favor this original version.5. Has an easy level that makes the game accessible to geezers like me.6. Has a hard level that will make your nephew realize he's not as f****** cool as he thinks he is just because I HAPPEN to allow him to use me as bait in FPS's. I could ""pwn n00bs like a boss"" if I wanted, I just choose to not hit anything I pretend to aim at on purpose.7. Great responsive and precise controls.8. Terrifies small children so they decide to go play with Rx rattles and hair driers in the bathtub instead of being up your a** all the time while you're trying to ignore them.Cons:1. You cannot eat anything with dairy in it the entire day before playing.2. You will still poop at least a little bit.3. It's so immersive you may forget there are children and/or animals in the house until after the fact when the entire place is destroyed and you wonder just how in the h*** you didn't hear any of it. Because the big screen falling onto a glass table HAD to be loud. Maybe that explains that demon that came through the window behind you then vanished?I highly recommend this game! Just go out and buy some Depends while it's downloading.			"

												It was really hard for me to recommend this game initially. I had played 5-6 levels and I was getting increasingly frustrated with the game. It felt nothing like Doom, and worse still it didn't feel fun at all. Read on and I'll tell you why you should get this game anyway.First off: This game is old. It runs by default in 4:3 resolution. You can find several solutions to this in the forums.Doom 3 tries really hard to be FEAR, Half-Life and Doom all at the same time. It takes a more realistic, dark and gritty approach to the original Doom storyline. It replaces frantic gun-blazing and monsterspamming with dark, gloomy and ""scary"" corridors with fewer, more powerful enemies. This in itself is not a bad thing. After all, Half-Life was a great game!The narrative is mostly told through voice overs or found PDAs. I kinda like this approach, it keeps you inside the world. Where this game suffers really badly is the actual gameplay. It tries really hard to be scary and it shows. It's pretentious at best and ham-fisted at worst when it comes to the so called ""scary moments"" with color shifts, lights going out and comically overplayed ""evil laughs"" echoing through the halls. The guns feel like pellet guns. There is no punch to any of the weapons, the sound assets for them are extremely weak and there is no satisfying feel to any of the weapons when you fire them. Enemies feel bullet-spongy and have a really annoying habit of not being present in the game world until you pass a certain trigger. This leads to excessively annoying moments where enemies keep coming from areas that you have already cleared. It's almost every single time you encounter enemies you'll have some coming from behind you. This can be cool for some panic induced fighting on occasion, but this game does it every single time and it gets old FAST.Now, with all these problems, why do I recommend it? Because I got fed up and installed Doom 3 XTRA mod. This mod updates graphics, model assets, textures and sounds to a more modern standard, but it also fixes all the problems I have with the gameplay. By giving weapons more punch and over all more satisfying oomph and sounds, it makes the shooting fun again. Sure the game is still overly pretentious with its scary ""jack in a box"" moments and enemies always coming from behind, but you know what? With Doom 3 XTRA I don't give a ♥♥♥♥. Thar be demons to shoot in the face!So in short, if you intend to get this game don't even bother with the stock game. Doom 3 XTRA turns this game from a boring yawnfest into a frantic shooter with some ignorable issues.			"

THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 | 2 *3*] = ~88% (75%-100%)Doom 3 (published 2004) is an awesome hellish corridor shooter with a great (albeit simple) campaign story, if you please ignore that demons from Hell should be unimpressed by earthly firepower.It's a very immersive ride that I have taken from A to Z at least 4 times. If you want to forget the world and live through a demonic science fiction story, Doom 3 is the way to go.The sounds require a bit of getting used to because they are equalized / dynamic compressed too extremely (though not as insanely as in Bioshock Infinite), but after a while this will feel alright.People say that Doom 3 is visually too dark, but what they are missing is that this is a game for serious gamers who want to go on an immersive ride instead of just having fun in the living room with friends. So, turn off the lights, use a big screen, tweak the FOV (The console allows to set anything you want.), and get lost for 12-18 hours in a dark science fiction tale that, while kind of routine once you know how to handle your weapons, will keep you on the edge throughout.Some people don't like that it takes a while before the action starts. Those, too, are not serious gamers. Drink up the mood! Role-play! Explore this science fiction reality while you're not yet under pressure and while things are still well lit.TECHDoom 3 uses real-time lighting throughout, and I believe it was even the first 3D 1st person campaign shooter that did this. While this has visual downsides (especially since the engine is old, so there is no hint of Global Illumination) compared to baked light-maps, it contributes immensely to the experience, and they show it off in quite a few places. Try to imagine what it's like to see this for the first time. Oooh! Aaah! Who wants to touch me.Both Doom 3 and the BFG edition can be modded, but not all D3 mods work with D3BFG. I played through the unchanged version of both and enjoyed both. I copy&pasted this review text to both.The Doom 3 title music is mono and very badly equalized - sounds like complete crap. Yay, a DVD-sized game, and they saved 2 MB on the title track. :( And guess what they did not change when they created the BFG edition - yep, as unfathomable as it may seem, the crappy title music file. In Doom 3 (Non-BFG.), you could at least easily mod the title music by supplying a file (incl. path) of the same name as it was in the data archive files, so I obtained a better sounding (and stereo) version of the track and even equalized it for more boom. Well, apart from this drastic oversight, Doom 3 is a great product.			"

												I loved playing this game, It was really scary and really in your face. It tries to scare you in the game by popping out instead of the chills down your spine scary you get in the F.E.A.R Series. It has alot of erie moments in the game. I loved all the detail they put in the game. It was one of my favorite. It is a must buy for any FPS shooter fan. Get it and you wont regret it!			"

												It was really hard for me to recommend this game initially. I had played 5-6 levels and I was getting increasingly frustrated with the game. It felt nothing like Doom, and worse still it didn't feel fun at all. Read on and I'll tell you why you should get this game anyway.First off: This game is old. It runs by default in 4:3 resolution. You can find several solutions to this in the forums.Doom 3 tries really hard to be FEAR, Half-Life and Doom all at the same time. It takes a more realistic, dark and gritty approach to the original Doom storyline. It replaces frantic gun-blazing and monsterspamming with dark, gloomy and ""scary"" corridors with fewer, more powerful enemies. This in itself is not a bad thing. After all, Half-Life was a great game!The narrative is mostly told through voice overs or found PDAs. I kinda like this approach, it keeps you inside the world. Where this game suffers really badly is the actual gameplay. It tries really hard to be scary and it shows. It's pretentious at best and ham-fisted at worst when it comes to the so called ""scary moments"" with color shifts, lights going out and comically overplayed ""evil laughs"" echoing through the halls. The guns feel like pellet guns. There is no punch to any of the weapons, the sound assets for them are extremely weak and there is no satisfying feel to any of the weapons when you fire them. Enemies feel bullet-spongy and have a really annoying habit of not being present in the game world until you pass a certain trigger. This leads to excessively annoying moments where enemies keep coming from areas that you have already cleared. It's almost every single time you encounter enemies you'll have some coming from behind you. This can be cool for some panic induced fighting on occasion, but this game does it every single time and it gets old FAST.Now, with all these problems, why do I recommend it? Because I got fed up and installed Doom 3 XTRA mod. This mod updates graphics, model assets, textures and sounds to a more modern standard, but it also fixes all the problems I have with the gameplay. By giving weapons more punch and over all more satisfying oomph and sounds, it makes the shooting fun again. Sure the game is still overly pretentious with its scary ""jack in a box"" moments and enemies always coming from behind, but you know what? With Doom 3 XTRA I don't give a ♥♥♥♥. Thar be demons to shoot in the face!So in short, if you intend to get this game don't even bother with the stock game. Doom 3 XTRA turns this game from a boring yawnfest into a frantic shooter with some ignorable issues.			"

												DOOM 3 isn't fast paced like the previous DOOMs, but its slower pace lets you soak in the great atmosphere. Plus this game has a lot of details in the world, like the PDAs and secret areas. It lets the UAC base on mars feel alive and like it could be a real place. The story is also surprisingly good, for a DOOM game. I would recommend DOOM 3 to DOOM fans, id Software fans, and anyone wanting an action game with a little horror in it.9/10(but I like DOOM 3: BFG Edition more)			"

												Doom 3 is a damn fine shooter! I have no idea why people are so split about this game.Pros:+ Great graphics (especially at the time) and amazing lighting. (And even better with sikkmod)+ Incredible level design, it's really hard to get lost in these levels.+ Pretty good voice acting.+ Entertaining story.+ Quite a long campaign (8-10 hours).+ Great mix of horror and action.Neutral:+- You have to switch back and forth between your flashlight and you weapons. This can be immersive or annoying depending on the person.+- The game gives you a ridiculous amount of ammo, therefore not really bringing in a sense of tension. I have seen other people mention that ammo is sparse, but one must require an impressively itchy trigger-finger in order to run dry. I mean honestly, I can't recall a single moment I had less than 200 shotgun shells at my disposal.Cons:- Cheap enemy placements. You will frequently run into imps that pounce at you placed behind doors, that gain aimbot abilities, and can turn 90 degrees around corners. Unless you have godlike reactions, this will hurt you, and maybe kill you. A lot.- Can get a little repetetive, both in gameplay and locations.- The weapons are a little wierdly implemented. The pistol and your fists are basically useless after the first 15 minutes, and your shotgun's range is so hilariously bad, it's basically a meleeweapon. I reccomend downloading the realistic weapons mod to fix some of these weird design choices. : http://www.moddb.com/mods/realistic-weapons/downloads/doom-3-realistic-weapons-v10A great action- adventure game you can get for dirt cheap. Absolutely reccomended. 8/10			"

												By far out of ALL of the 108 games I have, the scariest game I've played. 1. It won't matter how much you turn up the bright-ness it won't get brighter in the environment. 2. Like most alien games you're isolated from human life. 3. You're fighting highly agile, damaging demon/alien sons of b#tches. 4. Scary f#cking sound effects everywhere. 5. Any hidden ammo/armor/health you find torsos of f#cking babies with fly wings will thrust themselves at you with their faces and scare the sh#t out of you. 10/10 Sci-fi horror, Doom will never cease to be a good game.

												Doom 3 is a FPS Horror shooter game. The game is challenging, enemeis you face are horrific looking and interesting to fight, you have an arsenal of weapons you can use to survive on Mars. I've play this game along time ago when I was 4 years old (And no, I surpisely didn't get nightmares, mainly because I didn't know what was going and all I knew was point at the enemy and shoot), and this for brought back memories of playing this game. I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a horror game that has guns to use, and a interesting story to it.			"

												Back in 2004 this gamed looked amazing and I scared the ♥♥♥♥ outta myself when I played this game when it was first released, and I hadn't really given it a good crack since then, so I bought it again and modded the ♥♥♥♥ out of it to find that - it looks amazing and I scared the ♥♥♥♥ outta myself again. Granted the textures can look a tad low-res without mods, but I suppose that's not so much a negative point as it is a fact of life - for a 10 year old game it's fantastic, and, true to id's style, it's still as fantastically playable as it was back then. Not to mention the fact that, while you adapt your tactics and learn to fight the enemies better as the game goes on - meaning perhaps you are less subtly scared that you were when you started the game -  it's still an anxiety-riddled, delightfully stressful experience from start to finish. Highly recommended, and if you like you can grab as many of the well-known graphics mods as you can to bring it into the next gen.			"

												Don't bother with the BFG edition it alters the torch mechanic by having it suit mounted so you can use it with a gun spoiling the original game balance. You can also improve the graphic settings and widescreen modes by using a mod such as Absolute HD mod. Graphically it's just as shiney as the BFG edition. Absolute HD also incorperates the Sikkmod which enables you to aim down sights. A worthy sequal to Doom 2 in a sci fi horror style that is very atmospheric. I say that as someone who has been playing Doom 2 for around 21 years. I couldn't play Doom 3 in 2004 as at the time of release as my computer then wasn't powerful enough then.

												This is essiantially Half-Life 2 (when used with RoE) except for monster closets, satan, lower res graphics, crappy pistol models, and rooms darker than a middle school student's sense of humor. This isn't good as a Doom game, but when you look at it as a stand alone game, it's decent. The BFG Edition is highly reccomended if you want to use a flashlight and pump 20 pounds of buckshot into a security zombie who keeps dodging behind cover before you hit him. If you prefer a test of your insanity buy the original and hold the flashlight and bludgeon Imps with a flashlight while screaming, ""RIP AND TEAR!"" and then proceed to get covered in small spiders that eventually kill you and use ur corpse as a nest. And then... the dead community of the multiplayer... more empty then the energy of that one nerdy, awkward kid in gym that no one really ever talks too. Overall I rate this game 6/10			"

We at UAC take pride in our safety record, so please do not try grabbing ANY items whatsoever because if you do, those little monster closets WILL open and you WILL have your face eaten by malevolent demonic minions. Yeah, go on, try and grab that shotgun, we dare you! We shall subsequently enjoy watching the floor unexplicably giving way, dropping you in the middle of a dark zombie infested labyrinth!

												Doom 3 isn't a very good game unless you know how to create an autoexec.cfg file inside the Doom 3 Base folder.  That's especially true for the Steam version.  There are mods for Doom 3.  I recommend Cam's Gameplay Mod v2.6.  That mod will add a permanent flashlight to all guns and make the guns more effective.  Doom 3 can support high-resolution monitors if you add some commands to the autoexec.cfg file.  I've never played Doom 3 BFG Edition.  The fact that it doesn't support mods was what convinced me not to buy it.  Nevertheless, I've heard that the BFG Edition has smoother gameplay, a permanent flashlight for all guns, and slightly better graphics.			"

												DOOM 3 tells the story of John Doom, the world's first homosexual martian. After a straight scientist opens up a portal to Straighttown, the straightest planet in the Straight Galaxy, John Doom must take everything he knows about love and throw it out the window in exchange for the ability to slaughter hundreds of ghouls and goblins (or as they're know in the game, Straight people)Like many first person shooters, DOOM 3 is boring and tedious, but thankfully makes up for this fact by making sure you can't see anything 3 feet in front of you.

												All darkness jokes aside, Doom 3 was a landmark entry in graphical engine technology and first person shooters. Most of the ""horror"" aspects of Doom 3 are literally just darkness, mob spawn, rinse and repeat, with the occasional jump-scare. Still, it's a solid shooter that looked amazing in 2004.I actually would NOT recommend purchasing the ""BFG Edition"" of Doom 3;  part of the tension that Doom 3 built was the fact that you couldn't hold a light source and a weapon at the same time - being able to illuminate the area was a risk-reward scenario.  You could find items and navigate the area easier, but you leave yourself more susceptible to enemies.  In the BFG Edition, the ""Duct Tape Mod"" is a part of the game entirely, so the flashlight is grafted to your weapons, eliminating the calculated risk aspect that I just discussed.  If that doesn't convince you, Doom 3 Standard is cheaper too, I guess.			"

												I would give Doom 3 at least an 8/10. Now, don't think this is bad. I really enjoyed Doom 3 but my fealings go towards that I think they tried to hard. They were stuck with the old play style at little too much. Like, I get it that they would leave some play styles in such that were in it's predecessors, but too much so. A lot of the gameplay was dull and the scares became stale and lifeless. Even the Hell scene was kinda boring, it lasted like 10 minutes. I have to say though, the Cyberdemon fight was amazing. I really liked it, it truely felt like you were fighting a gigantic beast to save all of humanity. All in all, if you liked the earlier Dooms, I would give this one a chance.			"

												It's dark. It's heavily scripted. There are jump scares. You will learn to anticipate them and track enemies in the dark and then it won't be that scary. In fact, you'll probably be frustrated more than anything else, especially if you don't quicksave. At the end of the day though, it's a good, filling experience, well worth the purchase. Once you get the bigger weapons towards the end of the campaign it almost feels like Painkiller, just with more mundane weapons. Except for one of them, but you can figure that out yourself.AFAIK the multiplayer is dead, so you should only buy this if you're interested in between 10-15 hours (20 if it's your first time playing and you keep dying to surprises like I did) of timeless single-player FPS action, roughly four parts shooting to one part clicking on buttons and one part awkwardly fumbling around with the flashlight.

												While I wouldn't really call it a Doom game, it is a fun horror and sci-fi shooter with decent graphics, cool weapons, and a lot of visual and technical mods that is still fun to play to this day.Unfortunately, the Steam version has some serious problems. Graphical glitches and crashes to desktop are the smaller problems. However, I swear that at least ten times, the game has managed to crash my internet router. I don't know how it's happening, but I know all these bugs are at least directly correlated to how many times I load maps in the game in one sitting. Bottom line is that it's annoying, and it ruins the pacing at which the game can be enjoyed.I suggest a hard copy. I had one once, and had none of the problems I've had with this version.			"

												While it lacks most of the crazy blastiness that its forefathers so rightly hold, Doom 3 is still a game you should invest in. Not particulary scary or innovative but when you are shooting demons from Hell, it doesn't have to be.			"

												Doom 3 is an FPS Survival Horror game.  While I did not enjoy it as much as Doom and Doom 2, it still is a good.  It is a decent survival horror, with some tense and spooky moments.  I also recommend ot to Doom fans, to experience the re-imagined versions of their favorite monsters and weapons.  Combat can be fun and fast paced.  It is perfect for people who have played the original Dooms, and also are fans f the survival horror genre.  Graphics were decent for the time, and parts of the game required you to think and investigate your surroundings.  Although it starts out slow, the build up is necassary for you to start feeling uneasy before the action starts.Although I enjoyed this game, I would have preferred a more modern rip n' tear game.Now for the not so good stuff.  Keep in mind this is my opinion.  At times, they  jus throw enemies at you for extended periods.  Sometimes they aren't even strong enemies, and it is just annoying.  For example, the little skeleton spiders just keep coming and coming, and it smetimes breaks the flow of the game.  The guns do not feel very satisfying to fire, which is a minor complaint.  The darkness is also an issue.  The game would be IMPOSSIBLE to play through without the ductape mod to add a flashlight  your assault rifle and shotgun.  The mod does not ruin the atmosphere, and it encourage use of the default flashlight because the gun flashlights aren't as powerful.All in all, I definitly enjoyed the game, being a fan of the originals and of survival horror.  However, it gets a 5/10 because it requires a mod to have fun gameplay.Without Duct Tape mod: 5/10With: 7/10			"

												tl:dr it's like half-life, but on mars. the game feels more frustrating than it should be (on hard difficulty) not sure if it's hit detection or what, but most of my damage output felt inoncistent. sometimes i would 1 shot imps with a shotgun and sometimes i'd empty entire magezines to no avail. the enemy ai is rock stupid consisting of only charging your position be it with guns, hellfire, w/e, and any hitscan weapons they use are nearly 100% accurate so there's no chance you'll be dodging anything that isn't a projectile. however, the enemy types are extremely varied and numerous which forces you to pick the right weapon for the situation. every encounter feels like a pop quiz of ""which weapon is most effective against this enemy"" and i think this is where the enjoyment can be found. i never felt like i was killed from something unfair becuase if you pick the right weapon for the right enemy, you can survive anything.the campaign was much longer than i expected and it was for the most part a logical progression. the character you play known only as ""the marine"" is your standard emotionless silent protagonist who is transferred the a mars base as security. your day starts off normal until you walk for a while and everything goes batsh*t crazy. (sound familair?) when the game finally picks up you're constantly being barked at to move faster by your CO who apparenly isn't dealing with the limitless demons that you are because he has plenty of time to tell you to pick up the pace.the game isn't terrible by any means, but it has very little personalty to it.  nameless marine fights nameless demons who are being controlled by obvious badguy. i'd suggest picking this up on sale, but other than that, it's not worth full price			"

												While I wouldn't really call it a Doom game, it is a fun horror and sci-fi shooter with decent graphics, cool weapons, and a lot of visual and technical mods that is still fun to play to this day.Unfortunately, the Steam version has some serious problems. Graphical glitches and crashes to desktop are the smaller problems. However, I swear that at least ten times, the game has managed to crash my internet router. I don't know how it's happening, but I know all these bugs are at least directly correlated to how many times I load maps in the game in one sitting. Bottom line is that it's annoying, and it ruins the pacing at which the game can be enjoyed.I suggest a hard copy. I had one once, and had none of the problems I've had with this version.			"

												In its original form (ie without mods) Doom 3 is incredibly bland and unsatisfying. I tried to like it for so long because the graphics, at the time, were basically unmatched, like the Doom titles before it. But even as a young lad back in the early 2000s this game was way too boring for me. The combat itself felt incredibly flat even compared to the original Doom games. Enemy bodies disappear before they even hit the ground. The guns sound like ♥♥♥♥. The level design may have gone over well in the mid to late 90s but by the time this game came out it felt anachronistically bland - basically just long metal corridor after long metal corridor. Say what you want about Halo 1's level design, at least you'd go outside and have a change of scenery every once in a while. In this game, all you do is plod around and shoot at enemies with your clunky Mattel toy gun and watch as the enemies disappear before you have a chance to see the ragdoll physics, set in a universe where light only comes in two forms -  brighter than the sun or darker than space. I suspect alot of people are projecting their love of the series as a whole onto this game individually when they praise it.			"

I can't play any horror game out there where you're defenseless, I'm too sissy. But in Doom 3, hell yeah I feel like this hero with the power on my hands (big weapons) and able to make a difference. With some mods, the game doesn't show age, while having that old school horror atmosphere. A worthy successor.			"

												--- DOOM 3 ---The good stuff...- Good graphics with audio in world class.- Tight controls.- Scary as hell - DOOM 3 relay on audio/music to be scary and keep the player on edge at all times, just like any good horror movie - play it alone in the middle of the night with the volume cranked. Bring extra underwear.- ID's attention to details are amazing as usual.- The game has been nicely balanced and offer a challenge, even if you are good at shooters.The bad stuff...- A little too much emphasis on horror and lacks somewhat in the action department - it should be the other way around like the old-school DOOM games.- Even if the environments are beautifully crafted they do get old - pretty quick. It's tight, it's dark, there are long hallways with at least one jump scare somewhere..... and rinse and repeat. Final verdict...8/10 - just buy the game - it's DOOM and it's good.			"

												So I just finished this, and here are my thoughts. It's okay, though I really prefer the classic Doom titles. Has a very large horror theme, but it's not the same Doom.Pros: Has veteran enemies, weapons, etc, has some references to the classic franchise. Cons: The flashlight is very annoying when switching, Too dark, needs 16:9 support, Cyberdemon battle was very lame, earlier maps lacks ammo scattered, didn't really like the code input vaults idea, weapons are very weak.6.5 / 10 I do know BFG Edition fixed some of these issues, but meh. The game is not bad, nor good, it's only in the middle, mostly because im more used to the classic titles. I'd recommend this game if your into horror games.			"

												!!Important note!!If you don't own doom and doom 2, you will probably better off buying the Doom BFG edition. with that you get doom 3, resurrection, doom and doom 2,  you also get the lost mission expansion pack which is an exclusive expansion pack for the BFG edition and you also get an extra episode for doom 2 called no rest for the living. Doom and Doom 2 can also be played on the GZdoom source port as well. Just remember to check the system requirements for the BFG edition because they are much more demanding compared to the original doom 3 and resurrection games. The BFG edition doesn't have finale doom or the master levels.      What I liked about the game•	Fantastic level design, I liked the industrial/science setting of the game. I liked seeing all of the machines in the environment working and all of the computers showing lots of information.•	Interesting story on how the demon invasion happened. •	The game has a good horror atmosphere, there are also some jump scares and unexpected moments, it's not up there with fear or condemned but it's still good. •	Plenty of secrets to be found, some are hidden in quite clever places. With some of the secrets, you have to interact with the in-game computer to find them. You can find PDA'S of other workers at the UAC, which tells you what there work role, was. The PDA'S also contain audio logs, emails and also give you security clearances. You can also find video disks, which have information on them about certain things.  •	An awesome selection of firearms. My favourite weapons in the game were the machinegun and the plasma gun. •	Lots of different enemies to kill. Most of the enemies in doom and doom2 are in this game (IMP, Pinkie, Commando, and the lost souls); there are also some new enemies as well. Amazing boss fights, especially the 2nd boss fight and the last. Brilliant antagonist, Dr Malcolm Betruger.  •	 I know some people won't agree with this but, I quite liked the changes they made to doom 3, like making it slower paced, concentrating more on the horror experience and concentrating more on the story. It was something new and after playing doom, doom 2, finale, and master, I don't think I would enjoyed it as much if the game play in doom 3 was the same as the previous games. That's my opinion anyway.•	I prefer this version over  the BFG edition. I like how you have to equip the flashlight and you don't have to turn it off to let it recharge. I would say this version is much challenging. I found that certain types of ammo in this version were much scarcer.   •Awesome music theme.What I disliked or was disappointed with•	No Baron Of Hell •	The death animations aren't very good, the demons just frizzle up. •	The character you play as doesn't look very badass. The character in resurrection of evil looks much better. • I wish the game could autosave more often.   ConclusionOne of my all time favourite games. If you liked Quake 4, Prey or Fear I highly recommend you buy this game. 95/100			"

												Better than the brainless shooter ♥♥♥♥ they did with the new DOOM.Yes of course DOOM was in the beginning a shooter and story didn't matter as much as it did in DOOM 3, but they made both into one game. And now they created a shooter that exists a million times already.The story made the game more spooky and with that it's acceptable as horror game. I was scared plenty of times during the first gameplay. I was paranoid because it was one of my first horror games. It has plenty of features and they love the detail. Physics in not bad and you have both offensive and defensive parts. Also depends on how you play the game in the end.The new DOOM has nothing to do with horror anymore. It's just gore and rambo. DOOM 3 was the reason I wanted the new DOOM. The gameplays in the other hand showed me it's nothing like that. Yeah awards and ratings and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, CoD is ♥♥♥♥ and has plenty of both thanks to its massive kiddiesupport. That's not quality, it's quantity with high loads of ♥♥♥♥.If you want an adequate story, buy DOOM 3, if you want ""boom boom with ugly space thingy *uga uga*"" well then you'll be satisfyied with the new trash.

Not the DOOM 3 We were Hoping ForWell.. this is a hardone. I normally start these out with something along the lines of: ""If you liked X you'll like this game."", but for the life of me I can't think of a game close enough to this to liken it to.  I certainlty Can't say: ""If you liked Doom or Doom 2 , you'll love this game."", because the game takes a sharp departure in aesthetics, play-style and ... AH-HA! Dead Space. If you liked Dead Space you... er, never mind. That's just it, the game feels like iot was the victim of schizophranic development. GOne now are the fast-paced, cirlcle-strafing, Shotgun-Blasting, Demon-Splattering game we remember from Doom 2. Now replaced by dark, Claustrophobic,  corridors and cheap jumpscares.Doom3 tries to be somewhere Between Dead Space and System Shock 2 and manages to be neither.  Now credit where credit is due. The game looks gorgeous and atmospheric., when you can actuially see anything. THe Mars base actually feels like the sort of place people work and live in.  However this sort of upsets the game flow and I can't help but feel the darkness and tight corridors were there to compensate for the engine limitations, you know like the fog in Silent Hill. Unlike Silent Hill where the fog, combined with the open environment, created an an atmosphere of dread and uneasiness, DOom3's darkness is at first dread inducing  but quickly becomes just plain annoying.The game also cheats. It has a nasty habit of spawning units just out of sight so you think you missed something. And no this isn't the normal teleport with the evil light show. These arr enemies literally just blinking into existence where the designer feels the player will not be looking, like on the other side of a closed door you just came through.THougjh the question to answer is, can I recommend this game. Yes, but do not pick it uop if you're hoping for a good follow-up to the classic Doom games, taken as a generic, sci-fi horror, the game holds up decently, taken as a Doom game, not so much. If you never played the classics, this won't be a bad game for you. Wait for it to go on sale, otherwise I recommend the more recent  installment. "

												Now I will start of this review with I love this game but coming back to it I can't recommend playing the vanilla version of this game because the graphics of this version has not aged well I would recommend getting the Absolute HD 1.6 mod if you plan to buy this game.So what can I say about Doom that hasn't already been said its gory, its bloody and just outright brutal but this game took it up a notch. You play as an unamed space marine stationed on Mars City run by the UAC (Union Aerospace Corporation) you happened to arrive on the same day something extraordinary happens where scientists decide to open a portal to hell but didn't think to shut it for some daft reason and it all goes to hell literally because lost souls, imps anything evil and nasty has come out to play with your body being their toy. This game happens to take a more survival horror approach with limited ammo, non-regenerative health and satan wanting to play a few too many pranks on you in many rooms and it works for the amount of time I have played this game which I mainly played it on the original Xbox I was really petrified and even more frightend on PC.This is a short review because everyone knows what Doom is.Overall Rating for the Vanilla version 7/10Overall Rating for the HD mod version 9/10			"

												This game is so lovely.It beats the new Doom 4 game many times over and over again.If you are standing for a choice between buying this, or buying the new Doom 4, buy this instead.(Or better: the BFG edition, then you get more for the bucks)You will enjoy it much more, I promise you.This review applies to Doom 3 and RoE, not the other doom games inside this package.First, you get that nice peaceful playable intro without action that almost every game have today.Such intros always gives you a nice entrypoint (where you come from and why) while it ""starts up""the story in a proper way, and also gives a exploration opportunity to learn more about thein-game world without being disturbed by enemies.Then, you get pretty much thinking. You must read PDA's, Emails, listen to audio logs, figure out codes to proceed. Sometimes you need to read Emails or listen to logs to figure out what to do next, for example where specific mission-criticalobjects are stored.And you get no help, you need to figure out platformingfor yourself when that becomes applicable.That makes it extra fun.Another nice thing is that many ingame objects notnecessary for progressing, is also interactive,so sometimes the object is just for fun/enjoyment,sometimes the object is just a red herring to foolyou into thinking this is the next step to take, whenit turns out its not(For example, a door that never can be unlocked,eg requires a PDA or keycard not in game).This interactivity also adds to realism and itmakes the game more fun to play.Also, the really nice thing is that you sometimesreturn to a central ""hub"" (so theres multiple ""hubs"")that is specific for the chapter you played, afterhaving collected some keycard/PDA or donesome objective, which makes it extra fun asyou get to revisit old places and take new paths from there. This gives you a more sense of the facility.Also, theres a lot of puzzles that you need to figure out,one notable example is the maintenace elevator/platform,where you are given a slight hint and you have to figurethe rest out itself.And the cryo storage bins puzzle is GREAT. First youthink its just a dead end but after a while you figure it out.And that lovely crane minigame with the toxic leaking barrelswas just beutiful.I could warmly recommend this instead of Doom 4.Put Doom 4 in the garbage bin and buy this instead!

												A fun, if simplistic, shooter. It is annoying that monsters pop out of closets, and bodies dissolve so you can't leave a trail of corpses (the original Doom was better for that). But unlike Doom 4 (2016), this doesn't have Denuvo or double-jumps, so is a better game than the 2016 reboot.			"

												DOOM 3 may not be scary per say but it definitely is a well-executed form of ACTION survival horror. I prefer the more subtle approach to horror (Silent Hill 2 and 3) but DOOM 3 manages to bring a interesting blend of action and horror thanks to it's crappy feeling guns, dark cramped rooms and bothersome flashlight. The story and characters are forgetable and the DOOM marine has clearly had some therapy compared to his other portrayals. Otherwise it's alright and priced accordingly. DOOM3 is more of an interesting footnote than a great game if you compare it to the legendary DOOM 1 and 2 but it's not too bad in spite of how it's aged when compared to other games like Half-Life 2.

												I didn't like doom 3 when i first played it about 5 years ago so i decided to buy the game on steam and give it another chance to see if my opinion changes. It hasn't.This is one of the most boring games i have ever played and it feels like such a slap in the face to fans of doom 1 and 2 like myself. The shooting feels so clunky, the guns sound weak as hell and combat in general just feels stiff and awful.It's one of the least scary 'horror' games i have ever played and I feel no tension as i'm playing it. The only scare that works is the bathroom mirror scare in the first hour of the game. Unless you are very easily scared this game cannot be called a horror game as it is marketed to be.The enemy design is so uninteresting and boring compared to doom 1 and 2 which had some of the most interesting and memorable enemy design in gaming history its just sad to look at in doom 3.The pacing is awful, you are fighting like 5 ememies at a time max and that's the most tension you will get out of the game is fighting a small bunch of enemies in very tight corridors. The pacing is very slow and boring. If the game didn't have such dull and boring level design and atmosphere maybe the slow pacing would have worked but it just doesn't.I have used the word boring so many times in this review but that's honestly the best way i can describe the game and my experience with it. Boring.3/10 (Bad)			"

												Paid for game.  Downloaded and installed.  When I attemp to run it, it asks to input a D3 Key and a RoE Key.  It automatically provides the D3 Key but not the RoE Key.  So I cannot play the game.  Steam did not include the RoE Key in any emails they sent me to confirm my purchase.  I have had to contact support and now wait for who knows how long to get a reply.  This is lousy customer service.  You pay for a game, download it and you can't play it because Steam dropped the ball.   Beware.			"

												This game should not have the right to call itself Doom 3. It's nothing like its predecessors.If, like me, you're thinking ""Oh, I've replayed Doom/Doom 2 too many times, I should try the new one"", you'll be disappointed.If, on the other hand, you'd like a game where you walk in almost complete darkness along a path that might as well have been a long straight corridor to the end (given that there are virtually no bifurcations), with enemies constantly materializing behind your back, then you might like this game.

												When it came out this game was fine but after playing the new Doom this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing chore. Save your time and just play the new one.this game trys to super spooky and to make you feel helpless. It trys this in 3 ways1) make the whole thing dark 2) spawn emenies behind you and play a scream noise when they do summon 3) give you a ♥♥♥♥ control scheme.And yet it fails in all 3 of these areas 1)funny enough 1 and 2 cancel each other out. Since most enemies attacks glow its easy to still hit them even in the dark and makes the fact your flashlight isnt usable a big deal. the flashlight is better used as a weapon to fight minor zombies than it is to light up anything and its not like its worth looking at the enviroment anyway the graphics did not hold up as well as they would like to think.2) its not scary to spawn enemies behind the player. Its just annoying. within 15 minutes you learn the best tactic is to walk in a room, run in a circle, then go back to the door and kill whatever spawned behind you. better yet whenever you walk into a room just turn around and blast whatever deamon summoned with your shotgun because there is a dumb summon animation making the enemies super easy to kill. To try and scare you ever time the enemies show up they play the same screech that sounds like a child screaming because they didnt get their favorite toy at a birthday party. Play the game on silent and listen to a podcast or somthing because the sound design is trash. 3) To make up for the fact this game is annoyingly easy your stuck with ♥♥♥♥ controls. this is meant to trick you into thinking the game is hard but its really not. there is no reason for you not to be able to use the light and a gun except for the fact the devolper wants the game to be ""turbo spooky"". The reload and weapon switch animation and timer is also bad meaning your more likly to take damage because your waiting than because you actually made a mistake. Lets talk about how this game is just too easy. The smaller the deamon the harder they are to fight. Its just sad that the flying skulls and scorpion babies are harder to fight than the final boss. The final boss battle is a joke even on the highest difficulty. can you run in a circle for 3 minutes. Great you win. Sabbath, Hell Knights & Archviles are a joke because of the soul cube. wraiths,imps, crocodeamons, & zombies are all easily beaten by taking 2 steps backwards. the only enemies that are an issue are the flying skulls, scoripion babies, and spiders because the trash controll scheme makes it a pain to aim downwards and they only spawn near ledges where your easily knocked off. save your money skip this game and watch the cutscenes on youtube.

												Doom 3 is a mixed bag in some cases. On one hand, it manages to be a solid horror game with plenty of scares, scary concepts, and dark spooky rooms. On the other, that just isn't what Doom is. Doom is a fast-paced action game with bunny-hopping, weapon swapping, and non-stop genocidal mayhem. It's about as far from the original Doom as possible in that regard. I personally enjoy the sound design and music, though YMMV. The dark rooms are irritating to some, and while I do agree that the dark rooms themselves are an ordeal, it doesn't feel unintentional. And sure, if you want to completely remove the horror aspect of it then by all means get the BFG edition where you can hold your flashlight and weapon at the same time. But for people who accept it as a horror game, and want to enjoy it as a horror game, and also accept it as a completely different game from Doom, then it is well worth your time. Go check it out.

												This is my only negative review and I would never think that it will concern a DOOM-titled game. Much as I love the first and the second game, this is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying with camera jumping all around after being hit (which makes it barely possible to respond fire in the direction of the enemy), NO MUSIC (can you believe it?), claustrophobic maze-alike levels (where is my open-spaced mayhem?!) and no minimap (try not to get lost at least once, I dare you)Yeah, and there is this flashlight system, but imo it's not that bad. Eventually you'll get used to it.Overall it's doesn't live up to the franchise at all. Huge dissapointment. Play F.E.A.R. instead.			"

												So I rebought Doom 3. Why? I could'nt remember why I didnt finish it back in the day. Now I've played it I remember the horror. Not the demon related kind, but the kind derived from poor game design choices. The core ""combat""  experience is just a series of sucker punches as enemies spring in your face as you open a door followed by enemies spawning behind you, this doesnt create a sense of dread rather extreme irratation as it happens over and over and over. The gun play is woeful, with none of the guns sounding or behaving like powerful weapons. Couple this with your cross hair flying off as you are hit, it's like they confused annoying and challenging.The lighting is cool and the music is fitting but Doom 3 will be more remembered for its technical innovations rather than it's gameplay. And saying that these are all fairly standard now that leaves me no reason to recommend Doom 3 anymore.			"

You can't control the character at all on a decent machine; it plays too fast.Bind the movement to time instead of FPS.			"

												I love the Doom series but Doom 3 was a disappointment for me. The story and the athmosphere are cool but the game itself is just not fun. Except for the later levels everything looks the same. Just dark space station corridors and that's it. The game is very dark and littered with jump scares and enemies that pop out of hidden doors behind you. This gets tedious very fast. I also encountered a game crashing bug that prevented me from using a security camera at one point in the game. Get this game only if you really really love Doom. And if you get it, get the enhanced Doom 3 BFG Edition which has widescreen support and additional content. Stay away from the normal version.			"

												F&%&$#@ BULL#%&%.  The game is S%#@. Here's my experence with this game. (Huge fan of the older games) I try to change the screen resolution around 10 times of course you have to restart doom in order for the changes to take place, but when i restart doom my settings are back to its original BS resolution and it seems impossible to actually change the screen resolution, that started to ticked me off but maybe I'm just an idiot and was doing something wrong. So I put the game in windowed mode, and this is where the BS really starts. The game asks me for my CD key, so I go to my library to get my key for Doom 3.        KEY IS ALREADY IN USE.       Meaning I'm never going to be able to play a game I bought because if i cancel  the pop up requesting the CD key the game FORCE CLOSES and if i put in my CD key i get the """"""KEY ALREADY IN USE"""""" message. So im ticked off... GJ devs... F$%#@&! GJ			"

												TLDR at the end!  Doom 3 is probably one of the more disappointing games I've played and it has nothing to do with with its graphics.  The graphics in Doom 3 still look really good today, so thumbs up to Id's workmanship there.WEAPONS:First off, the weapons feel and sound weak in Doom 3.  None of the weapons in Doom 3 sound satisfyhing to fire at all.  They sound almost puny.  For a game that, for the most part, utilizes the other sounds in the game so well, they fall very short on the weapons, except maybe the BFG.  In fact, the weapons are all around just plain weak in this game.  The shotgun is really quite powerful, but only point blank (can 1-shot mid strength monsters).  Since you have to pump the shotty after every shot fired, point blank becomes dangerous and damage drops fast at any range.  You don't really get a powerful weapon until the rocket launcher.  The BFG is only slightly more powerful, which is sad compared to the almighty BFG of past Doom games.  For most of the game the levels are so tightly confined that I didn't even want to use those two unless I was desparate because I could easily kill myself in the process (and did a few times).  The Soul Cube puts the RL and the BFG to shame, but it has firing limitations.  THose limitations border on tedious making the effort it takes working towards the next opportunity to fire it annoying and painful.What I mean by weak.  There is no discernible difference in damage between the pistol, machine gun, chain gun or plasma rifle.  The later 3 just fire faster than pistol.  Using the spider monster in the game as a test, since they come in hordes and it's easy to use them for testing, it took the same number of shots (3) to kill one with any 4 weapons.  If I heard the spiders coming and had some space, I would just pull out the pistol, which has an annoying pause between shots, and pick them off at medium distance.  I'd reserve the other 3 weapons for close quarters, then I would just spray and pray.  This similarity in damage was apparent when used on all monsters.  The chain gun, a detriment to use due to its spin up time.  I usually took more damage with the chain gun than using cover and short bursts with the machine gun or plasma rifle.The grenades are strong, but a pain.  Their game physics treats them like they are those ""Super Bounce"" rubber balls but without the vertical bounce.  They have almost no vertical arc when thrown (trying to throw it onto a platform above you, or over a crate an enemy is using for cover?  Forget it!) and they bounce and ricochet horizontally all over the place.  Unless it directly hits a monster and explodes, the grenade is likely to ricochet back to you and kill you instead even if thrown around a corner.In the end, it was more effective, in most cases, to learn each monster's melee/fight pattern and just rush in, point blank them with the shotty, then jump out before the mob could recover from it's first missed attack to swing again.  I was even using this tactic on the top 4 of the most powerful monsters in the game outside the 3 bosses.STORY:The story was pretty bad.  Experiments release the hordes of Hell.  You kill the hordes of Hell seeking to take down those responsible and kill them.  Kill the creature holding the door open and close the gate and save Earth.  Good idea.  Doom 1 and 2 did this as well. The problem?  Tons of written dialogue in the form of e-mails.  Tons of voice dialog in the form of audio log files.  Video logs in the form of propaganda. A few cinematics.  Other than a couple minor things in the story, iD used all of this to tell the same story that Doom and Doom 2 told, which both managed to infer without any of the stuff I just mentioned.The only purpose most of that served was to add in probably the dumbest game mechanic ever.  Forcing me to browse every e-mail and audio file just so I can get the combination codes for all the storage compartments holding most of the armor, weapons and ammo.  Initially, it wasn't bad, but it got old quick.  Hello Google!GAMEPLAY:Doom 3 did wrong, what everything a slighlty newer game ""Dead Space,"" did right.  I'm not talking about graphics eventhough Dead Space, graphically, was superior because it's newer.  In Dead Space, every monster that came at you came from somwhere and by that I mean somewhere that makes sense.  They crawled out of panels in bulkheads, from under bridges, holes they ""created,"" busted out of corpses in which it was incubating, or tranformed said corpse into something else for it's own use.  You could hear skittering and crawling all ofer the place. It felt like they could come out at any point from anywhere and it always made sense.  They could be anywhere, anytime, but where-ever they crawled out, it made sense.In Doom 3, many monsters were hidden behind wall panels that were clearly wall panels that, when opened, were just empty closet like rooms where a monster clearly just sat there waiting for it to open.  The ""closets"" clearly served no purpose other than holding a monster to jack your butt the moment you ran into any small piles are armor/ammo lying around. This caught me off guard the first few times, but then never again.  Many times it was clear a monster just spawned somwhere because you triggered a spot walking through it and ""boom"" monster smacking you in the back.  No tell-tale sign.  Clearly, the game just popped a monster right behind me.  The only monsters that made sense were the ones that were ""summoned"" in for lack of a better term and you can hear the teleport sound.  Come on!  This style of monster spawn/use worked for earlier Doom and Quake games, but iD, you guys tried to add a story and go for realism.  Old Doom style monster spawning just doesn't cut it.Dead Space style monster spawning shouldn't be a limitation at the time of Doom 3 and was entirely possible.  Unfortunately, I think iD were still stuck in their Doom (1,2) and Quake (1.2) thinking and failed to bring something new to the table.  Instead Dead Space comes out and blows my socks off, and now I am here wondering how iD couldn't have pulled off something similar a few years earlier.Doom 3 is also too long for what it gives.  I've read from others that it kind of over stays it's welcome and I agree.  You spend forever in industrial style levels that didn't change until I was sent to Hell.  Once in Hell, I thought I was about to reach the end.  NOPE!  I finally end up back on Mars and I think it's close to the end.  NOPE!!  A linear FPS the deilvers task after task to accomplish before reaching the goal.  Many of which leave the game with a bloated ""wasting my time busy work"" feel.  Hell has the only interesting looking levels in the game although its hard to enjoy them because you can barely see in Hell.  Even with Max brightness.  Hell breaking into reality upon return to Mars looks neat, but only happens in maybe 2 spots.And finally, the most annoying thing about Doom 3.  For much of the game you are pretty ammo starved (even on normal).  This WASN'T a problem.  This was an acceptable thing as it adds some intensity.  The problem was that the moment the game finally ramps up and gives you a plethora of ammo so I can go Bat-Crap crazy, you don't get the chance.  The moment you do, you end up in Hell with no guns or ammo.  You spend most of the Hell regaining it.  Once back to Mars, no guns or ammo.  You spend most of the time rebuilding again.  Most of it adds up to excuses to make the game last a bit longer and feel bloated.  Not Scary at all.TLDR:  GRAPHICS: Still really good even for today.CONTROLS:  Crisp and responsive.WEAPONS: Weak and boring except for Soul Cube. STORY: Useless fluff to tell same story Doom 1 inferred perfectly.GAMEPLAY: Un-inspired, old, bloated style of level progression.  2 horrible game mechanics involving ammo/gun acquisition. Too Long.Sorry, iD.  I love your past games, but sadly this is a thumbs down.			"

												From the 2005 DVD Movie from MCA-Universal Pictures to the PC on Steam. It's bigger, badder & better than the first 2 DOOM Titles. You won't be disappointed once you get the DOOM 3 Pack, since it contains the Resurrection of Evil Expansion Pack that comes with the $12.99 DOOM 3 Pack. So, are YOU game?

												This game has exactly three tricks: turning off the lights, spawning monsters behind you, and brand recognition. If you've never played the Doom games before, you're better off playing Doom and Doom II instead of this, and if you're fans of those games then you're still better off playing them over again instead of this one.

												I remember why I didn't like this game when it was released. Monster closets. Really? If I secure an area it should stay secured and not have some 1X1 closet open with a monster in it. Zombie shotgun fire rate faster than mine .... seriously it is a zombie. Resolution limited, can be edited in game files but rarely sticks. Flashlight, guess there is no ductape in 2145. I can't hold a pistol and a flashlight at the same time? It really did have a smooth engine, but models where rushed and seamed. Drones have a path then stop, what is the point of introducing them in first 10 min to not be seen again? Or reprogramable. I have to assume marines in 2145 suck, I'm a rookie with a pistol and outlasted seasoned veterans with full body armor and weapons.			"

												You can mod this game as much as you want to make it look as sexy as possible, this game is just not fun. It's gray, dull, slow, not exciting and really, not that scary. You walk slowly, use boring weapon against really slow monsters, the game very rarely throws you more than one monster at once, so the enemies are more there for spook purposes than for combat.If you were hoping for a fast-paced action shooter like the original doom games, this isn't for you. If you were looking for a atmospheric scary game, there is much better stuff out there. If you were looking for a repetitive unexciting corridor shooter featuring repetitive unexciting shooting, look no further.			"

												I have never really been a real doom fan i got all the games in a bundle and played them all, i can see what people were talking about with doom 1 and doom 2 where all you do is just run and gun, for me that got really boring after the 3rd stage but for the time they came out what they brought to the table was good, but then i got to doom 3, now im all for game changes and mechanic changes but when you change your whole genre that is a dangerous game to play, as i said with doom 1 & 2 they were both run and gun but 3 turned into a ""survival horror"" game with a huge emphasis on survial mostly because you won't live for more than a couple of minutes since all enemies are placed in dark corners or right behind doors so that you walk by and get hit and that would not be so bad if some enemies like the melee enemies did not deal 20 damage when you have max armor and if you have no armor they could easily deal 40 or kill you when playing on the higher difficulties.The atmosphere of this game, if you can even call it that is minimal and the reason for that is because normally you can't see like 10ft infront of you because the game is too d@mn dark, now that may have been a good thing at one point in the development cycle but when you intentionaly place enemies in that area it makes it difficult to despatch of them because you can't see and if you get hit either by the bullet sponge guards taking 2-6 shotgun shells or the fireball throwing deamons that could take 4-10 shotgun shells on medium difficulty you'll die and have to deal with the horrid checkpoint system and do a big portion of the level over again or have a finger on the quick save button at all times.lastly this game is cheap to all new players, enemeis in this game will be the death of newcomers, being placed in @sshole-ish spots like right behind doors that you HAVE to go through or coming up from behind you from an area that you were just in, also some enemies that play dead, while it's very obvious that those are guys you need to kill while in that state you can't hurt them untill you complete the objective.I'd say the biggest reason that i do not like this game is because it is designed to kill you not just because it's dark or the enemies are hard it's because where there placed, the lack of knowlage of where there placed, and no way of knowing where there placed untill you have already takin a fireball or 12 guage buckshot up the @ss			"

												A sub par, generic FPS with a popular name attached to it with a forgettable story included.Its barely even a DOOM game if your basis for DOOM is 1 or 2.The game can be summed up as a slow, linear plod through corridors as enemies obviously spawn directly infront and behind you over and over and over. Situations are reused to the point you just get used to looking behind you everytime an enemy spawns infront of you and if theres one four legged beast enemy theres probably going to be another spawning after you kill the first.Its pathetically boring after you see that its just monster closets and triggers rehashed over and over and over with the same basic scenario. Of course theres the jump scares earlier in the game but after about halfway through the game you see just about all the fear you are going to get out of the game and it becomes extremely boring.The shooting feels weak and the shotguns a POS and most weapons are pretty worthless. Shotgun for close range, Plasma for damage dealing, and SMG for anyhing to far for the shot gun is what I went by. You do get access to a pistol, minigun, and a rocket launcher but they are pretty useless outside of specific situations.The puzzles add nothing and most the time add up to finding a button and pressing the ♥♥♥♥ out of that single button or finding a keycode on a PDA in the area then typing that into a lockbox. It sucks, slows the game down and adds nothing to the mechanics of the game. My only guess is that FPS puzzles were the thing, and as HL2 was coming out the same year I guess they thought they would have to have them to compete or some stupid reason. Atleast HL2 puzzles require a bit of wit and have interesting physics to them.I won't be completing this game as its absolutely nothing and is the reason I could not care less about Doom 4. I would rather play FEAR again.			"

												This is the least DOOM-like of all the DOOM games. They went with a survival horror feel, and it works, but it's not DOOM. In a series that is known for being able to zip around and chain together multiple kills with multiple weapons in large and open areas, having to manually switch out your weapon for a flashlight every time you want to see in the small, claustrophic environments doesn't quite feel right. If you're a fan of survival horror, more power to you.Get the BFG edition if you want to play a version that feel more like DOOM. More graphical settings for modern resolutions, and comes with Doom 1 and 2 and Resurrection of Evil			"

												A tech demo, disguised as a game. Doom 3 goes against everything id has previously produced. It's not real a Doom game, and it's not a real id game. Sure, you'll get your dedicated following, but this game is not a great FPS, all things considered. The gameplay is needlessly slow, the performance is terrible, and the video settings have this annoying tendency to force you to restart for the smallest change.The only notable thing, would be that it ran like ♥♥♥♥ on old PCs, ten years ago. That, and that area, where you look in the mirror and there's a jump scare. (lol)Disappointingly, it mimics the slow opening pace of Half life, despite lacking the little details. It just doesn't work. The world doesn't feel real, like in other linear games, and the combat is so dreadfully dull.This was probably id's weakest title. Only reason it existed, was to help sell an engine.			"

												So with this installment they went with a shock horror theme, which basically means instead of trying to instill fear gracefully and through tampering with the players mind, they send you through a bunch of dark corridors carrying a limited flashlight and send monsters out to go BOO. Basically, the kind of thing that's scary for all of 2 seconds when your gameplay is based around having a ♥♥♥♥♥on of guns and a boorish atmosphere.The gunplay itself is pretty generic too, and you can tell a game's bad when you don't even remember it a few months down. I remember one long elevator ride, and at the end you go to hell and fight the cyberdemon, and the rest is a jumbled mess of dark corridors. if I've mentioned that before, it's because there's not much else. It's like the devs changed or never really knew what made their games good, I don't know. Whichever it is, piece of trash, don't buy.			"

												Compared to the other Dooms even the 4th one this one is a discrace to Doom and the FPS genre. The game actually starts out pretty damn good until you reach the alpha lab 3. 1: The loading screens are somthing that need to be adressed imagine being stuck on a section for a bit and each time you die you have to endure 10 second long loading screeens. First you die and the screen fades into black, than it shows the failure screen, you then click of load game, than have to click on the save file you want to load, than wait in a 3-6 second long loading screen... than die and have to repeat it again. The second problem is that you have to save manually. This wouldn't be a problem however they NEVER tell you have to save manually. So how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of do you think I was when I made it to the end of the first stage than died, and started back at the underground level. So I had to run through 2 more levels each with long ♥♥♥ cutscenes and loading screens. The 3rd problem is that when you open a about 50 % of the time a enemy than attacks you which is really hard to dodge and takes of some of your health. Number 4 So sometimes as I walk along enemys spawn behind me which is really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying when I am already dealing with enemys from the front and now the back. And finally the 5th and BIGGEST reason is how ♥♥♥♥ing slow you move... The reason why I like Doom so much is that it is very fast and fun other than other fps such as Halo and Bioshock. With the sudden slownish it felt like I wasn't even playing Doom but a downgraded halo with worse graphics worse weapons and worse storyline which also sucks. If you look past all of that the story still is bland and predictable, the gameplay styles don't work, and the graphics are pretty decent for a 2006 game I believe. So to end this review I WOULD have given Doom 3 a 5/10 but thinking about it longer and considering this makes the Doom franchise look bad and didn't add anything new to the fps or Doom formula this game deserves a 4/10.

												While it is a definitely solid game, I can't recommend you to spent 15-20 hours of your life on it.Doom 3 is not a fast-paced straightforward shooter, instead it tries to be a survival horror and ultimately fails.Pros:+excellent, unnerving atmosphere. It kept me under pressure till the end.+darkness. It's everywhere. You never feel safe.+sound design. All kinds of growls, rustles, whispers to keep the tension.Cons:-level design. All levels in the game look the same. After finishing it you will remember only one, all others are just set of corridors. No open Mars terrain, no Mars cities, just base corridors. Bores you to death.-a LOT of backtracking.-very limited set of monsters.-although suspense is present, the game scares you mostly with a set of cheap tricks - like monsters appearing behind your back.-overall repetitiveness-NO replay value			"

												It's ropey. No story, no characters, fairly dull monsters. Level design is decent in that I rarely got too stuck, only when there were 2 sets of identical lifts, which happens twice.It's only interesting because of the stuff that doesn't quite work.You can kill just about anything with the shotgun if you get close enough, and you'll have to get good at that if you play at moderate difficulty. This dancing in and out of range, dodging fireballs then closing in for a shot and jumping back out the avoid claws, is the central game mechanic and should be wonderful.But the engine just isn't very good at it. I thought it was down to my computer years ago, now I find out it's down to the engine not coping with the motion.Should be great but it's pretty awful "

												Doom 3.General overview - average.Graphics - 5/10Sounds - 7/10Mechanics - 7/10Storyline - 6/10Time to complete - around 12-16 hours.Prologue of the story - The year is 2145. You are an unknown marine sent to a Mars station to reinforce the troops stationed there. Recently there have been many occupants becoming ill and even dying. On board your flight is a councillor from earth to investigate the recent happenings. You are required to grab your equipment and report for duty. This is where your hellish story begins.This game was released in 2004 and naturally, the graphics look dated. Some aspects are in HD like interactive computer monitors but most of the decals are very pixelated including your weapons which is a shame. The sound is above average with reasonable voice acting but the guns definately needed to sound like they have a heavier punch.There is a variety of weapons from chainsaws, chainguns, rocket launchers, granades and everything in between to put to good use against the enemy. If you search out the nooks and crannies you will find enough ammunition to keep you going. The AI are generally stupid and will persue you except for the marines. Sometimes they take cover.The story is slowly revealed to you through a bunch of PDAs the lab scientists have dropped. Not only do they reveal story plots but some will also have codes to gain access to storage lockers. Another cool aspect was having to go outside the station with a limited oxygen supply. It gives a real sense of dread of suffication. To add to the suspense you must lower your weapon to use a flash light. Some will find this a nuisanse if they just want a plain run and gun game.Conclusion : Don't expect epic content from this game but if you'd like to take a crack at a classic then this would definately count. Other notes : I had problems choosing a higher resolution to play the game in. It would always crash when I chose which one I wanted. Please check the guides for a work around to get better resolutions. It involves typing commands into the console. Unfortunately you have to do this everytime you open the game. I have a G15 keyboard so I bound the commands to one of my macro keys. Minimised the annoyance.			"

Old School... Somewhat RevitalisedFar from the classic it's hailed as, though it still looks good and holds up decently after all these years, sparingly providing moments of mild fun. The story is unengaging and it's pretty much a mindless corridor shooter through samey environments, littered with incredible annoyances such as the game's dated insistence on cheap-shotting you by spawning enemies behind you and the massive oversight that is the lack of flashlight weapon attachments.

												Terrible game, I don't know how this game got such great reviews when it was released. I mean c'mon people, this game came out around the same time as Half Life 2! The controls are stupid; a marine can't hold a flashlight and a pistol? Or just get some freaking duct tape? And don't talk about the BFG edition, that hardly fixed anything. Making everything dark is not ""atmosphere"" people! It just blinds the player so every enemy gets a jump on you. After an hour of playing nothing surprised me, because I knew that every blind corner or locked door held a ""surprise"" enemy in it. The most linear and BORING maps I have ever seen. I mean look at System Shock 2 from the freakin 90s! That entire game takes place on an industrial style space ship, which is a very similar environment to Doom 3, but each level is uniqe with a different design and feel. All of the hallways in Doom 3 are identical.Finally, one of the most annoying aspects of this game was the sound of the guns. Why do all the guns sound like toys?! The shotgun sound sounds like a bb gun; it's idiotic. After 7 hours of playing I looked online and saw a lot of people saying that it got better in the Hell levels, so I looked up a guide and the hell levels are only the last quarter of the game! Any game that takes more than 2 hours to get ""good"" is a game that belongs in the garbage. Doom 1 and 2 are roling in their graves and this piece of trash does not deserve to be called by the same name. I loved Doom 1 and 2 and I drink to their memory while I p155 on Doom 3's grave.			"

												First, I already know and love the game itself and have played it a great deal on the old Xbox. That is one reason I placed it on my Wishlist. My GF got it for me for V-day today, and I ran it and set my video options to the highest resolution available. It said ""Changes will be applied next time you run Doom 3"" so I close out and run it again. No change. It is default again. I do it 3 more times and it continues to do this. I can understand that it is an old game and will not run the HD resolutions that are currently popular, but it won't seem to run any resolutions other than 1024x768 either. (That resolution was selected when I selected ultra graphic settings: Which then prompted a warning about it using 500 mgb of video memory, lol. I have that on MY ONBOARD VIDEO, let alone the ATI 6850 HD I'm running) When I try to select 1600x1200 resolution (the highest available) and restart it resets the resolution to 640x480.I am unhappy that my girl spent 10$ on an old game that won't even operate correctly within the parameters that ID itself set into the engine. I would really like to see an update that fixes this issue.			"

												I decided to play this game quite a while ago because it was on sale and I was like ""Why not?""Let me tell you, this game blows. It is fun for about an hour and then it just goes stale. The game is totally repetive, in the sense that the only activity you do is combat. ""Oh look, demon #53. Click. Dead. Oh look, demon #54. Click. Dead.""You might say ""Wait, that sounds like all shooter games!"" No, that isn't true. Good shooters have a variety of weapons where each fits a different and essential role in combat. In DOOM 3, there are weapons that suck and are never used, and OP god-like weapons. Good shooters have a few abilities or combat tricks that you can use to react to enemies. In DOOM 3, the only move is click and shoot. DOOM 3 is also way to hard. Enemies spawn literally right behind you or next to you, then immediately use moves that you have no chance to avoid and/or one-hit-kill the player. Perhaps the worst thing is the complete lack of narrative. Only once did the game break into cutscene or feature some kind of dialouge. Basically, the plot is ""For some reason that nobody ever finds out, a hell portal opens randomly in some mars facility. Now go kill demons non-stop for 10 hours and then you win.""DOOM 3 is the worst shooter I've ever played. Utter garbage.			"

												This game is without question the worst game in the doom series.This game's biggest problem is the underpowered weapons with bullet sponge enemies. The shotgun in the game is a joke. Each pellet does pathetic damage, and you can get spread that will hit the floor and the celing at a range of maybe 10 feet? It takes 2 shots at point blank to kill an Imp. Like do i really need to say anything else?Enemy AI is pretty good for the soldiers. They take cover and are a genuine challenge. Imps crawl around and don't use much strategy, but they're imps so that's to be expected. Caoco demons just sort of float towards you, which isn't really that impressive.Other than that, the game was supposed to be about atmosphere and being a horror game, which it does well. It's genuinly scary at times and presents a good atmosphere and the story isn't half bad.That said, the gameplay is terrible due to the pathetic weapons. 4/10. Go ahead and play it, but don't expect something more than what it is.			"

												Especially in light of the far superior DOOM (2016), this game holds up even less well than at launch. Dull, repetitive and cheap shooter combat against only a few enemies at a time in confined and restrictive levels. Guns mostly feel wimpy. Levels go on for ages. The absolutely banal story and lore in the game will have you rolling your eyes at how unself-aware it is. Not recommended except to witness what were at the time amazing graphics.			"

												Doom 3 betrayed a lot of the beauty and originality that once was induced by Doom 1 and 2, the game was grim, dark, and overall it always had an atmosphere of horror lying around that didn't fit as well as in other games at the time. Ironically it seemed like Id software didn't understand their own creation as well as the members of the audience did, and it showd, it showd in the reviews, in the general opinion and view that people get even now while talking about it, it wasn't a bad game, it was just a dissapointing one, people generally espected a game where you felt like a soldeir of fortune, fighting your way through the runes of hell, ripping demons appart as others tried to reach and tear you apart, it was a wonderful reality but sadly it wasn't the real one.The game fails to reach several different of it's own ambitions, it doesn't know what it wants to be, instead it always bounces back and foward creating a circle of apathy for itself, often times it tries to genuinely scare you while other times it tries to recreate that same dream that we all had.It's clear that there were problems in the beginning of the development of the game, the team probrably didn't knew very well what they were trying to do and it ended up turning against them. It's sad to see one of my favorite games shred into an uncanny delusion of horror and madness, but it was probrably something that i should have seen coming since the day it was announced, i just hope the next one won't fail to achieve the old natural formula that i miss so much, but as for now i will go back playing through ""The Shores of Hell"".

Sadly, upon playing the game for about 2 or 3 hours in, the effect starts to slowly slip away. You start to realize and know when to expect a scare or 2. Nonetheless, Doom 3 is a great shooter.

When Doom 3, the first real ""Full 3D graphic"" Doom hit the scene with revolutionary graphics, the world was blown away by the capabilities of it. Sure, nowaways the graphics are standard and maybe even outdated, but back then they were awesome. As for the gameplay, its a simple shooter, blast away the enemies. In the narrow hallways with either light OR a gun, you have to survive the horrors of hell and eventually uncover the events that lead to the disaster on Mars.Mindless shooter, but fun in between.

												I'm going to give Doom 3 an actual recommendation because I really think it is one of the more underrated games. Doom 3 is iD's attempt to revitalize the classic Doom series 10 years later. Doom 3 departs from the ""explore the floor"" style of older Doom games and is instead an attempt at a more linear/scripted action-horror game that was in my opinion pretty successful. The engine is a bit dated so the monsters don't have the frightening look going for them like the ones in newer games, but there's a great atmosphere that the game fosters of an invisible entity orchestrating the events happening around you. Most of the ""spooks"" come from the lights going out or the game applying the overused red filter to the display and then having a bunch of monsters come at you. While not nearly as frightening as Frictional's horror games (Penumbra/Amnesia), the approach to horror it takes is closer to those games than something like Dead Space, which is more like ""monsters jump out at you as a loud noise plays: the game"". While there are a few ""jump"" bits in the game, most of what made me enjoy Doom 3 was the atmosphere and the background noise that contributed to the experience. The gameplay overall is closer to Quake II than Doom, with the more linear format but still having little secrets around you can find. Overall a decent successor to Doom in my opinion.			"

												If you want tense, psychological horror...put this game down and go check out Anna, Amnesia, and Penumbra.  If, on the other hand, you want to walk down dark hallways and have stuff jump out and get all up in your grill before you introduce their face to some shotgun shells then look no further my friend.While this game certainly left its predecessors' hordes of enemies and frantic mob combat firmly behind, it does deliver a scary (as in jump scares) experience and plenty of fun fights.Just FYI, if you're one of those haters that complains about the fact that you have to switch back and forth to the flashlight, fear not...get the ""BFG Edition"" which makes the flashlight ""armor-mounted"" and gives it a battery meter.  It also comes with your mommy so she can make the scary monsters go away!  BURRRRRRN			"

												This game is really good, most people don't like it because its no longer up to date with graphics but this game is still scary. I've only played 50 minutes when I'm writing this and I'm scared to go back. Its really dark and you can't have a weapon and flashlight out at the same time making it even creepier. The beginning is slow but once you hit the point in the game where all hell breaks loose then the game becomes intense and leaves you scared. Some scares can be predicted but other are extremely difficult to see coming. One that really got me was when i was walking through a hallway and all the lights go out, no visibility and i was too afraid to put down my gun, then a monster just jumps out at me. I screamed and accidentally paused the game. I love scarey games and this one is a must, it makes you second guess on if you want to play it again. I definitely will but I'll be scared out of my mind when I click continue. Multiplayer is dead though, i went on for a while and found no games. Hopefully it will come back to life but for now the single player is just pure amazing. The game has a great atmosphere and it reminds me of the old Doom but with enhanced graphics. they aren't the best compared to now but even then it still is good and scares me. If you're trying to decide on getting this game or not i would highly recommend it. This game makes me want to get Quake and Rise of the Triad because it is old school like them. Try this game or either of those two, old school gamers won't regret it.			"

												I'm going to give Doom 3 an actual recommendation because I really think it is one of the more underrated games. Doom 3 is iD's attempt to revitalize the classic Doom series 10 years later. Doom 3 departs from the ""explore the floor"" style of older Doom games and is instead an attempt at a more linear/scripted action-horror game that was in my opinion pretty successful. The engine is a bit dated so the monsters don't have the frightening look going for them like the ones in newer games, but there's a great atmosphere that the game fosters of an invisible entity orchestrating the events happening around you. Most of the ""spooks"" come from the lights going out or the game applying the overused red filter to the display and then having a bunch of monsters come at you. While not nearly as frightening as Frictional's horror games (Penumbra/Amnesia), the approach to horror it takes is closer to those games than something like Dead Space, which is more like ""monsters jump out at you as a loud noise plays: the game"". While there are a few ""jump"" bits in the game, most of what made me enjoy Doom 3 was the atmosphere and the background noise that contributed to the experience. The gameplay overall is closer to Quake II than Doom, with the more linear format but still having little secrets around you can find. Overall a decent successor to Doom in my opinion.			"

												What can be said about Doom? When it first came out it was a mindblowing revolution in graphics, gameplay and atmosphere. When Doom 3, the first real ""Full 3D graphic"" Doom hit the scene with revolutionary graphics, the world was blown away by the capabilities of it. Sure, nowaways the graphics are standard and maybe even outdated, but back then they were awesome. As for the gameplay, its a simple shooter, blast away the enemies. In the narrow hallways with either light OR a gun, you have to survive the horrors of hell and eventually uncover the events that lead to the disaster on Mars.Mindless shooter, but fun in between.

												Doom 3 obviously had a lot to live up to.    Doom was on more pcs than Windows was at the time of it's release.  Fuled by shareware, and college computer networks that allowed for lan games Doom and Doom 2 were like the worlds greatest virus.  I still remember the first time I saw doom in action.  It was Doom 2 to be exact.  I was with a firend at their uncles house, when i saw it on his PC.   Doom was kind of like Street Fighter 2, or Super Mario Bros, in that it changed my view on what video games could be.  I must not have been alone, because after doom, and ever since FPS games have dominated the market.  For the longest time all FPS games were called Doom Clones.   Doom and Doom 2 also happen to be the first games iever played online co-op on.  Another game changer for me.  You mean we can play together and be at our oen houses?  holy ♥♥♥♥!Fast forward to Doom 3.  Does this game grab me like the first 2 games did back in the mid ninties?  No.  Is it the greatest FPS I ever played.  Not close.  Does it even make sense?  Why the hell do I need a flashlight, and if I do, why can't it be on my gun.  I thought this was the future.  This game gets bashed a lot because of the fact it will never live up to the original two, but over all it is a solid experience.  It has interesting enemies, and the sounds effects are fantastic.  Turn off the lights, crank the volume and ♥♥♥♥ your pants, as you are dropped through the floor into a room full of zombies (if you're lucky)  ready to eat your face.  This game has updated versions of many of the original games monsters, plus plenty of new ones. They all have a habit of trying to scare you to death so that's fun.   I'd give this like a 8 on th 1 - 10 scale as far as FPS games go.			"

												Wow.  Just wow.  I remember playing the port of this game like 7 or 8 years ago on the original Xbox, and thought it was great.  And now, I finally get to play the dark-as-dark-can-be-environment-explorin', flashlight-holdin', demon-attackin', no-name-marine-havin', BFG-evisceratin', originally-made-for-PC-so-meant-to-be-played-on-PC game itself...makes me admit that I might even place it up there tied with both Half-Life 2 and Halo 2 for best FPS of 2004 by the time I finish.  Well..probably not.  At least not with Half-Life 2, that is.  This game isn't as least-imperfect as that one is.  But still; you get the point.  Oh, and if you have the right environment to play it in at home (at night, every light off in the room, no other sound(s) or distraction(s) for you to be preoccupied with other than that of the game itself) it might just make you want to metaphorically (or literally, if you have a weak stomach for mostly-effective jump-scares and just an all-around always creepy environment, along with a weak bladder that becomes prevalent because of said things) crap yourself at certain points during playing.  It just might.3/3			"

												Time to hop in our ""way back"" machine and travel back to 2004.  I remember when the tech demo of this game came out.  It was right around the same time as Half-Life 2; another seminal game.  I couldn't believe the lighting and physics possible in this particular game.  And then the ""alpha"" version got leaked.  And we all saw just how incapable our PC's were at the time.  Sadly, the game doesn't hold up well now.  The character models pale in comparison to their first glance 9 years ago.  Textures are a bit muddy.  The gameplay was designed as a simple shooter.  But come on, having to switch from flashlight to gun and vice versa?  Lame.  Now easily fixed with a mod.  I personally got this game for the Phantasm mod that was released.  Also the Doom Coop mod is pretty nice.  Check it out.  But only if it's on sale.			"

												Only thing I hated in the Orginal was that it was hard to get the Game to work on my Samsung Widesceen, Back then when I had a bulky montior I had no problems. But now I have to deal with Cfgs and Edits dont seem to affect my old game at all. But The BFG Edition on the Steam Store I saw is the only game on the planet with Widescreen Support. More Convient without messing the Res to get 1920 x 1080, Not the person to always have to tamper with Configs for Res for a old game all the time.Mostly the Widescreen Support is all I cared for sense I hate using Bulky Heavy Montiors that generate so much heat to play just Doom 3.This game is great but no one uses heavy bulky boxy Montiors anymore not unless your on a vart super tight budget to own a Widescreen Montior.But despite with no Widescreen Support the game is great if you can deal with a bigger Hud and stuff.

I have never played the BFG Edition before so I cannot speak on it's behalf, but what I can say is that the people complaining about it being too dark, or not having a mounted flashlight to help them, really do not appreciate the way that these features enhance the game. You really do feel paranoid at times when the area is pitch black and you have to choose between using your flashlight to see, or using your weapon in case of an unexpected attack. All in all I really do like this game and I can't wait for Doom 4 to be released!			"

												For me to call doom 3 a traditional doom game would be a flat out lie. It lacks mostly everything that made the doom games so great, levels are much more linear (still not as bad as many modern shooter) and it's less of a frantic fast paced action game and more of a slow, atmospheric horror game. There's nothing wrong with the latter of course, it's just a different approach to the series. The gunplay is solid thought there's nothing exceptional, the weapons are taken from the orginial doom, with a couple exceptions, such as the interesting soul cube. Monsters are taken from classic doom as well, which is great. It's quite a sight to see how monsters such as the cacodemon and mancubus translated into the Tech 4 Engine. The issue is the most iconic monster, the ""pinky"" demon is so grossly underused. I think I counted maybe 8 in the entire game? However, my biggest complain with the game is the lack of variety in the levels. The entire games takes place on a base on mars, which = boring.			"

												This game is surprisingly fun and scary for how old it is, and I like it! Although you could probably mount your flashlight to a weapon and not be in everlasting darkness getting spooked by anything and everything around every corner but why do you care, its' a DOOM game, start shooting those demons already!

												Let me get this straight - this game is not downright bad, but it's not a lot of fun either. Read on for more info.A departure from the series' roots, the third DOOM makes itself into an atmospheric game, much like Metro. However, unlike Metro this game is not a lot of fun to play.The best thing by far is the re-imaginations of the monsters, weapons and other entities from the original games. The climate comes just behind. Unfortunately, the combat is possibly the weakest point.As I said in my joke-review the gameplay is about walking down maze-like corridors and stopping every few seconds to deal with an ambush. That would have been somewhat alright if not for the fact that a lot of these sections are identical. There are very few areas in the game which try to mix things up a bit. The weapons feel clumsy and cumbersome just like the movement, which doesn't help.The only thing that justifies buying this game is the last third, which shakes up the level design of metallic corridors with hellish growth and lava. Enemies appear in groups of bigger than 2 at a time and from different angles. I sincerely enjoyed that part, but leading up to it felt tedious and I wouldn't want to do it again. Also, mods.			"

												Welcome to the mess hall, marine. Powered by one of the greatest game engines as a perfect exhibit for all of its astonishing capabilities, DOOM 3 packs a weighty punch. The highly interactive environments, the seamless integration with the PDA, and the splendid lighting create an atmosphere that is a living, breathing entity, urging all players to explore every corner, discover rewarding secrets and delve into its intriguing history. The sound effects deserve a special mention; from firing the shotgun or reloading a plasma gun, to the whirring machinery and hideous cries of the demon horde, not a single note is wasted, adding another layer of quality to the experience. Of course the action is outstanding, this is id software after all, the weapons and enemy variety are second to none. One substantial complaint is directed at the final boss battle, an anticlimactic disappointment that is way too easy, especially considering all of the preceding fights that led up to it. The hell level is short-lived and the true evil of the setting is never completely embraced, which is rather discouraging, and not something anyone wants from a DOOM game no less. Even with these faults it is still one of the best FPS games available and for damn good reason; id software created the genre.DOOM 3 is another exquisite chapter of a dearly beloved series that will have you hooked from the second you press New Game.9/10			"

												DOOM 3 is a fun game, quite worthy of the title DOOM. Despite being hard work making a sequel to the eternal classic DOOM and DOOM 2 Hell on Earth, Id software did it anyway and delivered a game quite similar to both of them, but evolved and adapted to modern graphics and gaming mechanics. DOOM 3 has it all: Imps, possessed soldiers, helldemons, flying skulls, hellbarons and the BFG. It also has a fun and scary storyline about the martian base being slowly devoured by hell due to teleporting experiments and some new elements, like the soul cube. A decent FPS game for newer gamers and a fun nostalgic game for everyone who played the original DOOM.			"

Yeah, it can be repetitive, but Christ will you be on your toes the entire time. The atmosphere at work here, while somewhat shallow upon close inspection, does the job when it has to--that is, while you're playing the game, which is the only time it matters.

												Doom 3 is an excellent Sci Fi/Horror FPS! More challenging than Doom 3 BFG because there are lots of dark corners and corridors but you can't hold the flashlight and a gun simultaneously. Doom 3 BFG is a bit ""brighter"" and you can use the flashlight and a gun at the same time (flashlight mounted rifle). I personally prefer the darker mood and added challenge of no light -- plenty of tension! Smooh play, a variety of powerful weapons and some pretty cool foes and bosses.			"

												If you need a reason to buy this if you don't already have it, just look at these side-by-side comparisons I recorded between the original, modded, and BFG Edition. Spoilers: DON'T BUY BFG EDITION. I bought it specificially to review it and the additional mission, which will happen eventually, I can't promise when I'll get to that because I already have other projects I'm working on. Anyway, check these out!If you just want to see the game in its ultimate form (with my personal settings for post-processing, pre 60fps YT), skip to 5:45 on the second video. Pretty much every single post-processing effect is available for modification. If you're interested in the mod, you can find it in the description of both videos posted here.

												It kind of goes without saying that the original Doom was a hugely influencial game that basically defined what a first person shooter should be and inspired countless other games to follow in it's footsteps. Doom 3 takes a slightly different approach than the previous entries in the series. The story and atmosphere play more like Half-Life than classic Doom but that's actually a good thing. Instead of just mindlessly running around shooting monsters you'll be carefully checking out every corner and room for precious health, ammo and PDAs so you can figure out what the hell has been going on. It's very cinematic. The flashlight plays a key role in this as you'll need it to see into the shadows. Players that want every first person shooter to be the same will be annoyed by this but it's inclusion kicks the intensity up a few notches.Speaking of light this is the type of game you'll want to play with all the lights off (or not). Even over a decade later the visuals and dark atmosphere are still impressive and often just downright unnerving. The human characters are a little on the blocky side but the demons, futuristic machinery and realtime lighting do a great job in immersing you in the environment. The sound design is also very well done with very effective and creepy ambiant noises. There is some seriously scary stuff going on in the walls and air vents in this game. Headphone users be advised.Note: This is the version to buy and not the ""BFG Edition"" which has brightened graphics and screws up key features (flashlight is no longer selectable). Basically just a misguided cash grab. Avoid.			"

It is a VERY atmospheric game, the bosses are epic, the enemies are epic, the weapons are epic, the Hell levels are epic, and the list goes on. This does not mean it is a perfect game though. The scares get a little repetative after a while, and the levels could be a little more varied. Many people like to complain about how it ""wasn't like the original."" This is true, however, it doesn't need to be. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking to have a good time. :)			"

												Doom 3 is the most story driven of all of the other Doom games (except for Doom 4). It's atmosphere is very vivid and frightning at times, and eerie, kinda like System Shock 2. A lot of jumpscares in this game. I really don't care for it on PC as much as I would for Xbox or Playstation. For me on PC, some of the enemies become invisible at times and framerate begins to drop and textures glitch out. Other than that, this game is great. 8/10. I highly reccomend giving Doom 3 a try if you havn't played a Doom game before.			"

ShotgunThere is a weapon in every FPS that you will always bring out, sort of your main weapon, For Doom 3 its the Shotgun, the spread and damage on this ♥♥♥♥ is unrealistic, like seriously, Doom 3 is an FPS which wont increase the difficulty of enimes a whole much (Except Bosses, most enimes go down in 1-4 hits from the shotty) but increase the amount of enimesso the shotgun is a trusty pick3. Machine Gun (New Guy) and Chaingun (Bunching them intogether because this is already gonna be a ♥♥♥♥ing essay of a review)Machine Gun is not a bad as you would think, It could take down most enimes if you emptied a clip into themFor the Chaingun however, I think its a bit OPFastest Reload in the game, stuns enimes, can kill anything in the game if you empty half a clip4. ChainsawBit Useless for Strong Enimes, but usefull for taking on Zombie Men so you consereve ammo a bit5. Rocket Launcher♥♥♥♥ing Amazing, Great Gun, Its useful for taking out groups of enimes, and for ♥♥♥♥ing over Hell knights and Pain Elementals6. BFG 9000 and Plasma GunThe Plasma Gun is great, ammo is everywhere, packs quite a punch, if you have run out of or trying to conserve Shotty or Ammo in General, use the Plasma GunBFG, the Big ♥♥♥♥ing Gun 9000, This time, it has a hold down mechanic, If yoou just press the fire button, it only uses one cell and is about the same as 2-3 rocketsthe longer you hold it, the more ammo it takes and the more puch it packsDont hold it for too long though, cause it explodes, such instant kill, much fail, it has a sound which allows you to tell when to fire the gunDislike1. PistolCrap, Only use for Sniping and Ammo Conserving2. FistsUseless, ♥♥♥♥, 2 Things I would like to draw attention toThe PDA (Personell Data Assitant) - This is amazing, you can bring up your PDA at any time by pressing TAB (By default), this contains video for you to pick up and watch, e-mails from the UAC and Sargent Kelly (Requesting you to be in Marine Command, linking with the story) you can also download e-mails from little screens, but this is pointlessIt also contains videos for you to download and watchYou can also download other peoples PDA, which have e-mails containg Security Codes for Lockers, Backstory and theres one really cool easter egg invovling the PDA, also there is a reference to Quake somewhere (Another Id Software Title) Audio Logs which give backstory and PDA's will update security clearence which will allow you through certain areasThe Soul Cube - Brilliant Weapon, Amazing, Now, you cant just whip this out during normal gameplay  (you can get this out by pressing q, but thats not what I meant) It only works as a weapon when you have achived 5 Kills, you fire it and it does around 1000 damage (1 hitting anything that isent a Boss) and then healing some healthNow you get this around 2/3 into the game on any difficulty level except Nightmare, because its so hard, you get the SC at the beggining of the gameAlso, If you throw the soulcube, it will go for the bigger and stronger enemy, alwaysEnimes and Bosses -Enimes:Some New some OldNew Guys are all bassicly the same, except- Big Buff Helmet Dude, whips you and if you try and go under, he kicks you which has some insanse knockback- Spidery Thingy- Machine Gun/Chainsaw Zombiemen - Zombiemen with a Machine Gun/ChainsawEnimes from Doom 1/2 which made the cut- Zombiemen, Shotgun Sargent & Chaingun Men- Imp- Pinkie Demon- Lost Souls (Why Id, why?)- Mancubie (Cant spell name)- Reveneant- Arch Vile- Cacodemon- Hell Knight- Cyberdemon (Final Boss, of course, who else?)Enimes from Doom 1/2 which didnt make the cut- Pain Elemental (Would be nice If they could make the Cacodemon look less like a Pain Elemental)- Spider Master Mind and Aracnotron- Barron of HellBosses:- ViraxSpider like boss, pretty easy, only boss that you see more then one of, you see 2 side by side later in the gameEasy with ChaingunNo Pattern, Its a ""Click till you win"" fight- Guardian of HellSeen in Hell (Duh), you recive the soul cube when you win the battle, this boss you have to kill its minions flying around it and then you damage the red thing on top of him, whole battle can be done with Rocket Launcher- SargeRemember Elliot Swann's Bodyguard, he says Sarge took his gun and then dies, Sarge is equipped with the BFG (Which is The Bodyguards Weapon) (you also take it from his Sarges Arm when he dies) He doesnt have a pattern, its a simple shoot till he dies battle- Cyberdemon (Final Boss)This battle is intresting, the Cyberdemon cant be damaged, his bag ♥♥♥ arena that he has a big gaping hole in the middle with enimes coming out of it, which you kill to power the soul cube to use on him 4 times before he goes downI would of liked the Cyberdemon and Sarge to be harder, The Guardian of Hell was the hardest in my opinion, took me 3 trys though5. HorrorNow, If this was a Doom 1/2 review, this section wouldent exsist, but this is Doom 3, which is Horror/FPSAtmosphere - Lighting is extremely well done, especially since you cant get out your flashlight when you have your weapon outTension - Having a ♥♥♥♥ load of enimes come after you is Tense? No, Not really, it would be in a game like.... Five Nights at Freddy's for example, but in Doom 3 its more annoying6. GraphicsDoom 3 shows its age in some places but DammOn a PC that cant run Minecraft at 20fps with everything turned off, I can play this at 40fps with AA on and Graphics on High QualityThats not bad7. BFG EditionShould you buy the BFG Edition? No""But, Doom 1,2,3,RoE and LM""for 1 and 2, get the Classic Doom Pack, it has 1,2, Master Levels for 2 and Final DoomFor 3 & RoE, just buy them on Steam, LM is the only exclusive thing in it, its half an hour, watch a playthrough of it on YT""But Flashlights on Gun!""Thats Bad, it ruins the horror aspect that made Doom 3 ""speacial""""But Better Graphics!""Its a little bit more polish, it wont make a differenceFinal Verdict for Doom 3: 8/10Its underratted as ♥♥♥♥, especially for how it has better graphics, story, gunplay and secrets			"

												When I first played Doom 3 I thought it was just so-so; a shooter that controlled well with a nice engine and cool lighting, but not a Doom game. I've grown to change my mind, and in fact this has become one of my very favourite games. I've played this thing over and over and over and it gets better every single time.id's engine is nothing short of miraculous. The level design is tight (though sometimes unremarkable and confusing) and the player can hide behind, jump on, and squeeze through everything you'd expect. The use of shadow in the design is superior to any other game, and having to juggle between a gun and a flashlight, even though it's ridiculous, adds tension and fun.The monsters are a loving homage to the original games. The animations are incredible and become spookier every time I upgrade my PC (especially with my 144hz monitor - it's SO fluid). They're fun to fight and id kept the important mechanic of having the player run faster than any other enemy, making movement your most effective weapon. That's the key ingredient of Doom and that's what makes Doom 3 a true sequel.It's fun to navigate, it's fun to shoot, and every moment is full of tension and wonder as you explore. Doom 3 is a gem and I can confidently call it a ""desert island game"". I never seem to get tired of it.			"

												I know this game's old news now but I still think it's exceptionally well-made. I found it to keep true to classic Doom in a lot of ways - you'll find a lot of the same enemies and items, and of course the scary feel is there as well, as anything could jump out at you at any time. The creepiness is helped by a great build-up at the start. It's a good balance between scary and action, though. Throughout the game you will make use of a PDA which is a clever way of keeping track of security keys, which will give you access to secrets and new areas, while also giving you some comical background about life on the station before the whole demonic invasion thing.

												There were a few really cool ideas in Doom 3. I loved the introduction level, especially that ghostly skull popping out of the TV and then posessing that guy who visually transforms right before your eyes into a zombie-like creature. I loved how this elevator door opened, revealing some zombie-soldier, whereby I got shocked a bit and blasted his head with my shotgun. I remember my bro laughing as his brain basically popped out. About the 3rd level I liked how the lights switched off, it was completely dark! And when I blasted away with the machine gun, you could see the muzzle flashes reflect on the zombies in a rather artistic kind of way. I really disliked this game overall. But here comes the eye-opener! After completing the game, I viewed the credits and to my surprise it was only a handful of people who created Doom 3. You could even say it was almost an Indie game. And that deserves recognition.			"

												Underrated masterpiece. The fact it's pretty much the reason Dead Space exists is reason alone to respect this game to an obscene degree. Doom 3 single handedly created the horror FPS with flashlights in the dark. It took atmosphere, graphics, and sound design to a whole new level, and the game STILL looks stunning TO THIS DAY.The gameplay is fun and frantic and harkens back to the old-school days of FPS, which in this day and age is a blessing.Again, ahead of it's time and a trailblazer, nearly everything you find in Dead Space (and many other games) was created or perfected in this game like in-game PDAs, flashlights in the dark, electronic readouts over doors and guns, etc. If it didn't create some of these things, it was popularized with this game.Though System Shock and a few others before had treaded very similar ground, Doom 3 took things to a whole new level.Play in the dark with the sound up and have a hell of a time.

												Wow.  Just wow.  I remember playing the port of this game like 7 or 8 years ago on the original Xbox, and thought it was great.  And now, I finally get to play the dark-as-dark-can-be-environment-explorin', flashlight-holdin', demon-attackin', no-name-marine-havin', BFG-evisceratin', originally-made-for-PC-so-meant-to-be-played-on-PC game itself...makes me admit that I might even place it up there tied with both Half-Life 2 and Halo 2 for best FPS of 2004 by the time I finish.  Well..probably not.  At least not with Half-Life 2, that is.  This game isn't as least-imperfect as that one is.  But still; you get the point.  Oh, and if you have the right environment to play it in at home (at night, every light off in the room, no other sound(s) or distraction(s) for you to be preoccupied with other than that of the game itself) it might just make you want to metaphorically (or literally, if you have a weak stomach for mostly-effective jump-scares and just an all-around always creepy environment, along with a weak bladder that becomes prevalent because of said things) crap yourself at certain points during playing.

												Doom 3 is a decent game, though it has many problems.The opening sections have an atmosphere that is unparalleled, and there are intermittent scenes that are also great. That said, partway through the game it becomes a much more generic game that lapses in its scariness. If you take away the darkness and you hold down the run key, the game is basically the same run and gun shooters its predecessors were in many sections. If you were a huge fan of the first games and this is what you like, then that's great. If you're looking for something deeper than that, then you may have to try harder to immerse yourself. As I said, the beginning definitely is everything it is advertised to be. Later in the game, though, I found myself getting very bored and hoping the game would end.Most of the enemies just jump toward you and are designed to fluster you. It's not really scary for the most part, but if you are easily scared as I was as a young teenager playing this game, it will freak you out. It becomes predictable as well. Enemies spawn in most rooms, you gun them down, then you repeat in the next room. The formula works out for a while, but by the time you get to, say, the Delta Labs, you'll be wishing the game would throw something new at you. The boss fights are exciting decent but easy, perhaps with the exception of the Cyberdemon that appears in every Doom game ever. Many people complain about not being able to use the flashlight and shoot at the same time. While it can be annoying at first, once you get good at switching it actually works pretty well. I know the new BFG edition allows you to use both, but I feel like that would kill the experience too much. It adds a new level of strategy and horror, so don't be too put off by it.There's not much of a storyline, but there really doesn't need to be. You're just trying to survive and make it through the Mars base, eventually defeating the demonic forces, while hitting a number of objectives along the way.The graphics are good, about what you'd expect from a game made back in 2003. The facial animations are terrible (except for the player's own and a few notable other NPCs), but the rest is decent. The mirrors actually work though! This is something most developers try to avoid, but id Software did them right!I would definitely recommend this game to people wanting a decent horror experience, but I warn that it will get repetitive about halfway through the game. If you can look past that, it is a very fun horror shooting experience!			"

												Time to hop in our ""way back"" machine and travel back to 2004.  I remember when the tech demo of this game came out.  It was right around the same time as Half-Life 2; another seminal game.  I couldn't believe the lighting and physics possible in this particular game.  And then the ""alpha"" version got leaked.  And we all saw just how incapable our PC's were at the time.  Sadly, the game doesn't hold up well now.  The character models pale in comparison to their first glance 9 years ago.  Textures are a bit muddy.  The gameplay was designed as a simple shooter.  But come on, having to switch from flashlight to gun and vice versa?  Lame.  Now easily fixed with a mod.  I personally got this game for the Phantasm mod that was released.  Also the Doom Coop mod is pretty nice.  Check it out.  But only if it's on sale.			"

It's just this game is pretty much completely different from DOOM, DOOM 2, The Ultimate DOOM, and Final DOOM. This game has a more atmospheric horror game feel that is very unlike the first games.

												A must play by far! It's both thrilling and challenging, all about memorizing where each enemy spawns and how you can over come them while saving your limited ammo and health. The best part though, I'd have to say, would be that enemies cannot infinately respawn, unlike most games. Every room has X number of demons. And if you miss any items, you can always go back for them later. So ammo and health aren't always as scarce as they seem, but try not to waste supplies.			"

												Dark, intense, and a lot of fun to play. The horror element wears off a few hours in, but it's still a great post-Half Life fps. Get a flashlight mod if you're not playing the BFG edition.			"

												A really well made shooter, but it gets repetitive to all hell near the middle to the end. The cheap scares also get annoying, since how can you be afraid of a demon ou can kill with just 2 shots out of our shotgun?So if you like actiony shooters, you should get this on sale. I don't regret the time I spent with htis game, but I think I'll likel never play htis game again.Also, be sure to check out graphics mods, if your compute can run it!			"

												Played this game since I was in middle school, and years later, it still stands up today. The old school Doom fans may not like D3's horror style of gameplay and lean toward the classic run 'n gun mechanics but D3 fulfills its own niche. Definitely choose this version over the BFG edition, as it has massive mod support. Sikkmod makes this game look better than the BFG edition, and other mods such as the LMS 4.0 (Wave survival, Custom coop) and OpenCoop (campaign and custom coop) provide extreme replayability. A ton of custom single player modded maps are also available for your choosing, most notably Tested and the Ultimate Hell Campaign. At $12 for the doom 3 + ROE pack, this is a steal, and even more so during steam sales.			"

												Doom 3 is a badass first-person horror shooter developed by id Software. Takes place on Mars in 2145 and all hell has broken loose!The game is scary since it’s using the two of the main horror elements: Darkness and sound. You never know what’s around the next corner and you have to make your way through puzzles, zombies and demons. YES! I said demons! What are they doing on Mars? Well I won’t spoil the story.Mind you this game is creepy, look out for the babies (Yup, you read it right the first time).Even though the game is showing its age the id Tech 4 game engine is still impressive even in 2013.If you’re up for a nice corridor shooter, then pick up Doom 3 now.Peace.

												Walk down plain metal corridor, scary thing pops out, kill scary thing, big plain metal room, scary things ambush you, kill scary things, continue to plain metal corridor, scary thing pops out, kill scary thing, big plain metal room, scary things ambush you, kill scary things, rinse and repeat but sometimes there's new scary things. Shotgun is crap. Also, you can't see. Good game. 7/10 Beans.			"

												I liked this game for some odd reason. I don't know, I may be nostalgic, but good game nonetheless. Good pick up for the price.			"

												DOOM is one of my favorite series of games that has been made. I know this game is older but the graphics are great and the gameplay is awesome. Replay value is something this game will always have in my opinion.			"

												This game is REALLY amazing, a mix of shooting, puzzle solving and generally crapping your pants all roll into this one game.If you want a game that makes you feel powerful, get this game... Nothing quite says ""powerful"" like punching a demon so hard, that it becomes a skeleton.If I haven't said this already: GET THIS GAME!!! :D10/10			"
