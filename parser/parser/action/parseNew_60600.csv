												SHMUP+Upgrades+Coop = Great but, without really any online community to speak I suggest you buy this game with 3 others if you plan to really enjoy it.			"

												ProtoGalaxy is a classic example of a shootemup or bullethell game, it reminds me of pretty much every classic arcade  rail shooter I have ever played. one major difference here is that there is a map builder and story missions, those are a pretty neat addition.  ProtoGalaxy looks super old, and there is no multiplayer community whatsoever, but the game is free so that is another plus, it provides a decent amount of single player fun and I would recommend anyone interested in the classic arcade feeling of the game to go ahead and give it a try.  I have not had any problems with the game besides the Steam achievements not working.			"

												This game has a truly powerful engine for building levels! Once the community gets strong, endless bullet patterns for everyone!			"

												I liked the concept, I bought the game. No decent controller support: partial controller support is claimed but how do you configure it remains a mystery. No online help found. Too bad.			"

												A fairly fun scrolling shooter with a lot of ship customization. It lacks a bit of polish, and the upgrading system is kind of confusing, after you get the hang of it, you should be fine. It features four-player co-op as well (even local co-op), which is always a plus. It might not be worth the $9.99 price tag, but I'd say it's worth the $3.40 sale price for sure.			"

												Protogalaxy did not impress me. It's a pretty straightforward arcade game: seperate controls for moving and firing; try to manage both as best as you can while you're being bombarded by up to a dozen enemies at once.The tutorial it thin. But what really put me off is that it's the kind of game where you might play a 5-minute level for 4:30, fail at the end, and then have to start the entire level over. Bleh. The repetition is painful.I do not recommend this game.			"

												Great concept and its gone free to play WITHOUT in game purchases, so as of now if people complain dont listen to them, what do you expect for a free game, its a top down shooter set in space, it has a great ship upgrade and co-op system with great space mechanics for a top down shooter, however it needs to be develped for mac and the thrusters need to change depending on the way you face.

												Game is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls are wonky, with some fixes to that it could be a really good game, but the interface feels too clunky. Maybe multiplayer is better, but I tried to get into this game to no avail. Keep searching.			"

												The game is the first impression to me is bad after started the game found is really awfulThe first level as long as along the screen can run smoothly but by the second difficult moments The enemy configuration disgusting even Also puzzles Each piece of ""building blocks"" to find otherwise unable to passIs the only set novel gravity gun You can drag and drop the enemy meteorites Even the enemy's bullet This is the highlight of the game			"
