												Even though this game is over 9 years old it still holds up as being one of, if not THE best zombie game on the market. It's not only fun playing single player but it's hilarious when you can get three more friends to join in the zombie killing.There's of course the standard Easy - Hard difficulities (Here being Easy, Medium, Advanced and Expert). So if you're looking for some mindless slaughtering to do you can put it on easy or if you and your friends is a tatical squad preparing for the zombie apacolypse this is a great way to start!Also you don't have to play the first game to get into this one, all the maps and more from the first game is in this one. Even if you want to play oldschool there is a mode for that. Speaking of modes, there's Versus mode which is exactly what it sounds like, you control both the infected and the survivors in rounds. The one who ends the final map with the most points win. There is also a realism version of this mode which means the survivers can't see the green/orange/red glow around them as they used to.There's also Survival which is aslo what it sounds like. Survive for X amount of time and you get bronze, silver or a gold medal depending on the requirments for the map you're playing.Scavanger is the last major gamemode, here you play as survivor and infected and the objective is to fill a generator with gas. Who wins depends on which team's the fastest.Then, finally, there's something called mutation. These are pretty much fun little mini modes. For example you have to try and survive an entire campaign on your own, you and all your teamates have katanas and can't get other weapons, you need to carry around a lawngnome to win etc.			"

												Dear Humans. This is Tank. You probably know me from hit game Left 4 Dead. Well, Tank need to get something off chest. It make Tank sad that as soon as you see him, you start shooting at him. Tank not mindless killing machine. Sure, Tank enjoy smashing human skulls to paste. What 12-foot tall, 800 pound, horribly mutated creature wouldn't? But there is another side to Tank. Tank also enjoy stamp collecting, scrapbooking, and updating blog under pen name ""Love Muffin"". Tank took origami class once at adult-learning annex, but fingers to big, so Tank smash teacher. Got B-minus. So, when you see Tank on the streets of city, instead of shooting, try asking Tank how day is going. You may find that you and Tank have more in common than you think. Of course, Tank will still smash you, but you will die having made new friend. And that make Tank happy.			"

												Yes, this game is good. It's worth buying. Yes, even after almost 7 years after the release people still play it even despite the fact it didn't really receive any new content. Why? Well, let me explain.Is it good because of graphics? Totally not. Even for early 2010's graphics weren't anything that impressive. It's still almost the same Source engine which powered Half-Life 2 and episodes. Yes, it was constantly updated but it didn't really progress. I mean we still have the same concept from early 90's: a game server hosts a map and up to 16 or 32 (or even 64 in some modifications) players can join and move around the map. You can reach certain points of the map and it will load another map. And that's all about it. But it's not open-world in any sense. It's something that reminds me of Doom and Quake games. In fact Source was partially based on Quake engine after all.But don't think graphics are bad. No, they are pretty enjoyable. I just don't recall technological advancement being a major selling point for this game. The game can impress you sometimes. Some textures look really dated. But overall it's just there. The game graphics won't make you scream in excitement, nor it will disappoint you even in 2016. A lot of stuff is destructible. I saw hours spent on zombie animations: infected puke, beat eachother, walk around, die spectacularly if killed. It's nice to see actual damage done to their zombies' bodies: some severe dismemberment and burning. But some may say graphics are kinda old. (Please don't think I'm one of these guys who only cares about polygons and realism, I'm just getting started.)So maybe the story is the main element here? Nope, you can complete the entire game without even learning anything about the characters or what's actually going on. You and 3 other people are given a selection of weaponry, medical supplies, some other stuff. You have a very simple goal: get to your destination or do something. Just get out of there alive.So why anything from 10 to 20 thousand people are playing this game right now? Why so many people played it for two or three thousand hours? Because of gameplay.Words cannot describe how many different situations there are. There are only 10 or so types of enemies, 3 basic types of main weapons, a few different secondary weapons, grenades and other items. And that's it. I know it may sound a lot at first but very quickly you acquire a taste for a favorite combination of weapons and items.Left 4 Dead series somehow manage to make people spend thousands of hours of their time playing the same set of maps. And it's a corridor shooter which means there is only one way to achieve your destination. How it's done then? Well, every time different items get generated in different places, you get zombies from different spawn points. You can play the same maps over and over, again and again. And people actually do.Speaking of people, it's a multiplayer. Yes, there is single-player mode where you can complete campaign with bots. But the most fun is playing with people. I find PvE aspect extremely interesting. Keep in mind your enjoyment really depends on people you play with. This game is about cooperation, you will never be able to complete it alone. So you have to find a server with good players, maybe you should play with friends, maybe you should make friends with people who play properly. Playing with bunch of griefers will suck. Playing with someone who actually wants to play is the best thing since sliced bread. Holy crap, you have to help eachother. Someone shares a medkit with you. His medkit. A medkit is being spent to restore your health you wasted because you made bunch of mistakes. But someone helps you for some reason. And you help them back, sharing resources with them. Oh, and keep in mind there is no reward system for helping others.There is PvP where you play as a bunch of zombies against a team of survivors controlled by other players. But I don't think it's as good as regular campaign. If someone thinks you are bad for the team, they just kick you out. Call me a weirdo, but I play it because of sense of fellowship or at least some basic positive human interaction. I don't really like the idea that someone may feel bad because I outsmarted them.I think I finally cracked Valve's logic. The main thing about a videogame is gameplay. This is exactly why we have these debates “%gamename% isn't a real videogame!!11” and other stuff. It's gameplay first. Yes, you need amazing visuals to make a masterpiece but it isn't the main thing you should focus on. I heard about Crysis as a game with great graphics many years ago, finally I decided to give it a try. I was utterly bored after a couple of hours — its gameplay was dull. Yes, you need story and great sound effects. But they still are only an excuse for gameplay.Left 4 Dead 2 doesn't fail to illustrate this concept. You can play it right away, you don't have to read wiki for 2 hours to craft a pickaxe or to build a basic rocket to orbit Kerbin. It takes minutes to learn basic concepts. “Easy to learn, difficult to master” — yes, we have it. But after a couple of hours I began to care about the story. You play as one of 4 characters, who are they? Turns out they are almost real people with some depth to them. Not too much, just enough to understand how they feel about each other. The whole story of zombie virus is told through surroundings. You see countless writings on the walls, a lot of documents are scattered around. The story told not using some boring and forced cutscenes but using details. You may skip story elements if you don't care about it. Or you may spend hours reading L4D wiki like I did.Valve remembers that this is a game. If you look through L4D concept art, you will see that survivors were supposed to look a lot more different. They wore a lot more utilitarian gear. In the final game they are wearing casual clothing which helps to establish who they were before the outbreak. I mean look at Rochelle's ear rings. I know what zombies would tear away first. It's unrealistic, and is it bad? Nope, it's fine, it's a videogame, not a reflection of reality.There is a lot of stuff in Left 4 Dead series which have never been done before. Developers added commentaries in game how they ended up creating everything, it's really interesting to check out. And I think I finally understand Valve's logic: they create games with some new elements. They create a game, it succeeds. Then they make a sequel which feels much better, they implement everything they need to make a great videogame experience. This is exactly what happened to Portal and Portal 2, Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2. This is exactly why Half-Life 3 may never happen: what exactly new can you say about first person shooter genre? It was told so many times, it's really hard to come up with something new. And this is exactly why they keep working on Left 4 Dead 3. At least it seems they are working on it. After all Left 4 Dead 2 appears to be incomplete to me. I feel like you can add more stuff in this concept.But right now it's totally worth spending money on Left 4 Dead 2. It's a very addictive game, and most importantly people are still playing it. If you get bored, there are tons of content in Steam Workshop you can b-a-s-t-a-r-d-ize the game with (if in you are in that kind of stuff).			"

												I can't stress enough about how this game, right here, is argueably the best game you could ever get in the Steam store. Everything from the gameplay, co-op, mechanics, narrative, game modes, visuals, weapons, characters and the modding community are equally all fantastic and highly remarkable. It's one of those essential games every PC gamer must have in their Steam library. It's a massive step-up to the first game in the franchise and it would take a lot of hardwork and determination to make a sequel that could ever hope to topple this one.I could write a much longer in-depth review about this brilliant game, but either you, the reader already acknowledge a lot about this game, through its strong magnitude and reputation. On the other hand, I personally would just want to leave it as the hidden gem, for the very small, minimal group of people who are still not familiar with this game, even to this day. With a message to those people, being simple and direct; you will not be disappointed by how much this game lives up to.I would advice the newcomers to this game to take it slowly and definitely look out for the -75% off sales or even better, the free offer of this game which is most frequently appearing on big Steam sales. I hope this short and simple review will come in handy and have a happy halloween!			"

												Energizing versus mode(s,) breath (and life)-taking COOP experience; a world of add-on maps available, easy to mod.  I'll let my six thousand hours speak for themselves!  This is just one of those games you can't beat unless a fantastic sequel is made for it.  Here's to hoping!  Nobody does it better than Valve.  You get your money's worth with their games.  This one is no exception.  Even if you purchase L4D2 on sale, or if it ends up part of some bundle, you're still coming out ahead.  I challenge any new player to this game, or skeptic for that matter, to play out the first full campaign (all maps,) and then re-evaluate if your're still uninterested/skeptical.   I'm confident you'll be happy you gave this game a chance;  some games are hyped and popular for a reason:  They're GREAT games! They could have taken my money, but all they got away with was my heart.   I paid 3 times more for games that I could never play a fraction as much as this.  I'll refrain from promoting a modded community I serve in, but let me say, to sum it up:   there is ""An L4D2 Experience"" for EVERYONE!  Buy it.			"

												The successor to Left 4 Dead, this second game adds new maps, new weapons, new special infected with new attacks and even new characters. But in many ways the most important different between the two games is the scoring system.Without mods, the first games scoring system really did tend to induce rage. A single mistake on a map and you could lose so many points that teams would be totally demoralized and either fall apart (making the game effectively over) or just quit (making it absolutely over). For hardcore players this was half the fun, but for the average casual player it could make Left 4 Dead a little too frustrating.Left 4 Dead 2 on the other hand had a far more forgiving score system allowing teams who fail badly on map 1 to still feel they have a good chance of clawing the in back in the next 3 or 4 maps. With party wipes being a little less likely due to the removal of the quad cap, Left 4 Dead 2 is still a game people can play causally and still enjoy. With the extra variety of a lot more special infected meaning a lot more variety in possible tactics, Left 4 Dead 2 is still one of the best team focused games that I have ever played.If you have a small group of close friends who love winning through superior team work rather than superior twitch skills, Left 4 Dead 2 is one of the best PvP games you could try. But be warned, playing with random people you have never met can be rewarding, but more often than not it can be bloody annoying.HOURS ON RECORD : I don't play this game on my public account. I have over 1500 my private account.			"

												L4D2 is a vast improvement in L4D in almost every respect. It actually has a plot for starters. Each chapter flows into the next as the four main characters try to escape hordes of the infected. That's right! They're not actually zombies folks! They're just humans infected by a virus that makes them exhibit zombie like personality traits, a plot line also been used a million times. But the plot is really not what matters here, it's not supposed to be important, as much as the plot as I got from the game without trying to find it was ""Here are some zombies, here is a gun, have fun."" What we're really here for is the gameplay.In addition to your weapons you can hold presents such as Molotov's or Pipe Bomb's, the latter of which is incredibly useful and incredibly awesome to behold. If you don't enjoy hundreds of zombies piling together then have their exploded body parts ragdoll through the air then something clearly went wrong when God was handing out the human brains and bird brains.Along with your dopey common infected are the more dangerous and lethal special infected who can ravage through a player's health in a matter of seconds as well as separate them from the group. These zombies must be brought down together and the players must constantly stay together to rescue each other from these zombies unless they want to lie down seductively on a dinner plate instead. The strongest of these are the Witch and the Tank, The Witch being able down a player in a single hit and The Tank having ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly insane amounts of health. All four players must stay together and work together to progress through the levels and do what is required of them depending on which chapter they are playing. The inclusion of these special infected zombies makes the game much more interesting and challenging than other zombies as well as bucketloads more fun.While playing through the same five campaigns may not seem like a good length for a game, this is made up by the other modes L4D2 brings along. There's the usual survival mode that almost every shooter has nowadays. Scavenger mode where you play the worst ♥♥♥♥ing part of the game over and over. And Versus mode where you get to play as one of special infected zombies in a team of four and try to stop the humans from reaching the safe house. This is one of the few games where I actually enjoyed the multiplayer, maybe it's because the game is focussed around it but that's beside the point. Versus mode kept me entertained for hours on end and even now I would go back and play it.The real reason that people can replay L4D2 over and over even though it's the same level is because of a bit of smart programming called the ""AI Director."" The AI Director has the ability to change the placement of walls, weapons, power ups and items in each level as well as being able to spawn hordes of zombies and special infected. This is done to an extent on one level on the fourth play through I was still discovering new paths through the level. No game has anything else like this and it is a unique bit of programming on Valve's behalf.BUT, remember that sentence about body parts flying through the air? Well that is in the game, but not in the Australian version. The Australian version of L4D2 has been cut down and censored to fit under the MA15+ label as we have no R18+ classification. Even Valve themselves were startled and confused by the refusal of the classification and I can understand why completely, the original game is not that bloody or violent that it would need to be banned. So say goodbye to corpses, body piles, gore, dismemberment and decapitation, apparently if we see that we will all turn cannibal and eat each other.Left 4 Dead 2 is a standout game that deserves the praise it gets. The gameplay is highly entertaining with good replay value due to the AI Director as well as beautifully atmospheric. The online multiplayer is actually quite good which coming from me is a massive ♥♥♥♥ing compliment so go out, buy this game, and witness it's mastery.			"

												I have been playing Left 4 Dead since the original came out on Xbox 360 in 2008. Once I got a PC that could run Left 4 Dead 2, I discovered that Left 4 Dead really has no end of enjoyment. It is not for everyone of course, but if you like slaying zombies, exploration, teamwork, fun with friends, and some hilarious moments, this game is excellent.It is now 2016, and still, people are making mods, addons, skins, new game modes, and creating unique servers that change the rules of the game. It is hard to get bored with a game that people keep adding to this much.You will unfortunately hear about, or experience yourself, bad players on this game. This goes for EVERY game out there on the Internet. If there is a way to ruin other players' fun, there are people who will try to do it. Please don't blame the game for bad players. Left 4 Dead 2 still has hundreds, maybe thousands of players who love to have a good time and try to support eachother in game. I'm one of those. =D If you have a bad experience, try again please. More good-natured players are always welcome.To me, this is the best game in the world right now. This is because it provides a fun way to meet cool and amazing people, who enjoy this great game where you are rewarded for working TOGETHER, instead of just killing eachother. The game itself provides lots of fun, but what really makes it amazing are the people you play with, and people who continue to make the game better.I have put off writing a review to this game for so long, because I really can't say enough about it. This review seems like it barely scratches the surface to me. All I can say is try it. TRY IT. Join some games, download some add ons and try those. Remember not to take it too seriously. Get killed, laugh, try to get better, die more, laugh even more. XD Left 4 Dead forever haha.			"

												This game alone is the main reason i bought a pc to start off with, with hundreds of hours on the xbox version of the game, i wanted to ""upgrade"" my left for dead experience, utilising the modding community and being able to finally play with my other friends on the pc and i honestly dont regret it, however there is one major drawback to the enjoyment of this game, the overwhelming amount of toxic players that are in the community. This can really ruin your game experience especially for unexperienced players as you will be kicked for almost any reason, half the time for no good reason at all. Examples could be:- Missed the insta kill spot? kicked! - Shot a teamate by accident because he ran infront of you? kicked!- haven't already played over 500 hours of the game? kicked!- your team leave you to die for no good reason? kicked!- can't speak russian? kicked!- use a health kit to save yourself on 3 health and not help your team mate who is on 43 health? kicked!- get slowed down by common infected when the team rushes? kicked!- do really well against the other team? the entire other team leaves, closing the server- take the melee weapon that a 9 year old on your team wanted? kicked!- use your mic and sound older than the 10 year olds in the game? get called a pedo and get kicked!- the vote kick on you doesnt get accepted by the rest of the team? vote kicker leaves the gamethis list could go on and on... oh and there is the guy that joins, kills the team, throws himself out of the window and then leaves i mean just **** those guys(would just like to mention these are the examples that have all happened to me in the past two weeks of playing)Despite this however the community does have some nice people in it, who just want to play the game and dont mind helping people or losing unfortunately these people arent extremely common so alot of the time your stuck with a toxic team that will kick you for just about any reason if your not perfect.Other than the toxic players however, the game really doesn't have much i can fault it on- There are 11 campaigns that are ready available without mods and campaigns aren't to long and remain pretty interesting throughout - a Fairly wide range of weapons with 14 guns, 11 melee weapons and three throwables. - There are eight characters, four for each left for dead game each of them as interesting, funny and well developed as the next - there are 9 different types of infected (including special common infected under just common infected) with 7 of them playable in the verses gamemode- the A.I director helps keep each level a little bit different, making replyability enjoyable- bringing along friends is a great idea as it supports 4 player co-op and 4v4 player matches (there are servers that raise this cap, immensely)- there are 70 available achievements that you can get along with 8 trading cards, each of which are available in foil version and there is 5 Emoticons and profile background also availableThe modding community for this game is absolutely amazing with mods for just about anything with different weapons, and character skis, HD textures and lighting, new campaigns and gamemodes, different infected skins and sounds there is  a mod for the amount of cockroches that spawn on the ground (i have this, its called Roach Rules) i would list more mods but that list would take to long to type. There is also a lot of anime mods and bikini mods for the character zoey so if your into that, you'll like the modding community even moreOverall, despite the bad sportsmanship of some players, it really is an enjoyable game, with lots of replayability and things you can do to the game to make it diffferent, bringing along friends can make the game even better and if you dont have any (i know the feeling) chances are you can find some when you play.Overall i'd give the game a 8/10			"

												As you can see from my hours played.  This is one of my favorite games of all time.  The real reason people have put so many hours into this game is because you are able to mod the crap out it and I joined a group of servers years ago and played ever since.  Not playing much now because not many people play this game anymore but was the best zombie game for it's time.			"

												Even though this game has a highly toxic community it still remains one of my favorite games of all times. The game started pretty tough for my three friends and me on normal difficulty (campaign mode) and we wondered how you could ever beat it on advanced or even expert? The level of helplessness and panic was just incredible. By now, after more than 1000 hours ingame, I know the game pretty good and I know that this game has for sure a nice learning curve. After some games the panic starts to turn into understanding and later on into a level of serenity, that turns this game into quite  another game.For me the toxicity is actually kind of fun in an online campaign game - I try to take it as a challenge. Am I able to win this campaign with such a team?With all the toxicity going on, the rare occasions of finding nice and skilled players online is pretty awesome.Once in a while you find this one game, where four random people just stomp the game into the ground: One for all and all for one - no one is left 4 dead!

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a first-person shooter game from Valve. It is a sequel to the previous game Left 4 Dead.Left 4 Dead 2 lets you play as another group of four survivors on a brand new campaign with a crossover campaign from the first game too. These new survivors are Rochelle, Coach, Ellis and Nick. This sequel has more game modes to play and even more choice of weapons to use against the undead, but there are also new types of special infected too, so be prepared to be amazed, or dead. It seems that Valve finally decided to add Left 4 Dead campaign into this new game, but the feels are different as the new infected also present in the old campaign along with the new weapons and improved graphics, making the game even more replayable.Left 4 Dead 2 also comes with Steam Workshop support so there are lots of user made custom content you can download to customize your game, like custom weapons, custom survivors, custom infected and special infected, custom maps and event some people made custom campaign with their own story. You can also make your own content and share it with public.Overall, Left 4 Dead 2 is a really good sequel. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a hard game to review. The left 4 dead games ""both of them"" are games that are unlike anything else I have ever played, they are games that quite literally changed my entire life. These games are the types of games that you can meet people on that will be friends for years to come and these games also have an unreal amount of replay value. you have campaign for the casual players with addon support so you have an almost endless amount of maps to play if you dont mind downloading more, you have versus which can be really fun, but sadly in both games unless you play with friends the community is either tryhards that care too much about winning or people that are so terrible that you wonder how they even got their computer running in the first place. Lastly there is survival, my personal favorite game mode. People in the survival community ""once you actually find the real survival players"" are useually a nice bunch of people and its a game mode unlike the other two in a good way once you give it a chance. Honestly both of these games although they both are titled ""Left 4 Dead"" are very different and many people i have run into tend to think of one game as simply better than the other, but objectively speaking this is simply not the case. Both games are too different to really make that kind of judgement. Both of these games are games that if you enjoy this type of gameplay, then you could waste thousands of hours on them.But this brings up the biggest problem with these games, the people in them. Do enough searching and you will find people you can mingle with but the majority of public players in either game regardless of game mode are unbelieveably dumb. In vs also not just the really dumb people but you have the typical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s found in any game based around pvp that seem to think that winning makes them more important somehow as a person and don't seem to realize that there is no reward for winning in a l4d games like there is in a competitive game like counter strike or dota with their tournaments. Campaign is a really casual game mode compared to the other two but still there tends to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in this game mode too sometimes, people that find joy in joining pub games just to grief their teammates for some reason and then leave without a word. Thankfully this is rare and most people in campaign are either mute or friendly.Then there is survival, a game mode that brings me more enjoyment but also more frustration than any other mode. In L4D2 it seems to be a collection of people that for some stupid reason refuse to play anything except for the mall map, people that are actually really terrible at it too and can run laps for 100+ min on mall sure but could not get a gold on any other map to save their life. There is l4d1 survival as well which is a dif style of play but the community is dying off because all of the players who have been around a long time have gotten tired of the game and pubs are beyond stupid. Always either people trying to glitch a time or people so bad/dumb you wonder if they were dropped on their head as a baby 5 times.All in all, You will enjoy the l4d games, both of them if you enjoy co-op based shooters, but you will have to endure a very mixed crowd of people regardless of game, with the first game haveing a somewhat more friendly crowd cause of the smaller community. I would recommend both games if you have the patience to search for people worth talking to or have someone to go into the game with.			"

TL;DRWith a rating of ""A+"", Left 4 Dead 2 is considered to be a classic FPS game, the second part of the series that teaches us how teamwork properly works in a world full of zombies.

WARNING‼ It features neither Progression nor Ranking systems, thus matchmaking can be unfair.Basic info.Genre:Action (Shooter, Survival horror)Theme:Post-apocalyptic, Zombie-themedPlayer type:Single-player | MultiplayerPerspective:First-personSummaryFollowing the tracks of its precedessor, Left 4 Dead 2 takes place in the zombie-infested U.S.A., where a new traveling 4-membered group of Survivors fights for survival. Having in their disposal a vast arsenal of weaponry, the player faces the endless hordes of Infected, exploring several locations, completing objectives, and trying to find a way-out.Main analysis | Overall score: 89 ⁄ 100 | Rating: A+Technical work19 ⁄ 20Controls: ★ Honorable◼◼◼◼◼Valve's set of easy-to-learn, player-friendly controls is a typical element shared among its games, including Left 4 Dead 2 apparently.Mechanics: ★ Exemplary◼◼◼◼◼◼◼The mechanics are very simple, yet exciting. As a result of the availability of many different types of guns (including firearms, SMGs, shotguns, rifles etc), melee weapons (ranging from a katana to a chainsaw, and from a guitar to a freakin' frying pan), grenades and other equipment, the player can choose whether to shoot, cut, decapitate or burn the Infected.Gameplay modes: ★ Fantastic◼◼◼The map and mode variaton is remarkable, as there are both Single-player and Multi-player game modes that include Campaign, Survival, Versus, Realism, Scavenge, Mutations, and more.Functionality: Good◼◼◼◼◻Bugs are quite often phenomena in the Left 4 Dead 2 universe, yet the game runs smoothly in general.Story14 ⁄ 20Setting: Great◼◼◼◼◼Mostly set in fictional areas, suggestively located in the post-apocalyptic, zombie-infested U.S.A., Left 4 Dead 2 features a great variation of beautiful locations, including a hotel, a mall, an amusement park, a stadium, highways, swamps and isolated villages, a mansion, a sugarcane mill, a gas station, cities, and more.Characters: OK◼◼◼◼◻◻◻ Left 4 Dead 2 introduces a new cast of Survivors, including Nick, Rochelle, Coach, and Ellis, sticking to the series theme number, as well as the gender ratio of its predecessor. Unfortunately, apart from the adventurous stories that are hillariously narrated by Ellis, there is nothing else worth mentioning about the whole group, as the Survivors are overly restrained by their repetitive voice commands. Unlike Left 4 Dead which manages to balance this flaw by additionally realeasing an online comic[www.l4d.com], with intriguing new info about its characters, Left 4 Dead 2 fails to attract the audience's attention towards the new Survivors. Thus, they are bound to seem indifferently mysterious, if not completely impersonal and boring.Plot: Mediocre◼◼◻◻◻Along with its predecessor, Left 4 Dead 2 follows the same basic, trite concept: a small group of random Survivors who share no history fight for survival in a world world full of zombie-like beings, known as the Infected. A classic scenario ends up being completely vapid and unchallenging, as the linear levels and the simplified objectives both add up nothing of interest to the game's plot, and also restrict the player's contribution to just killing zombies, activating generators and other machinery and calling for help.Extras: ★ Sweet◼◼◼Left 4 Dead 2 has to offer the following free “DLC”:
 The Passing; The Sacrifice, with No Mercy; and Cold Stream, with the rest of the original Campaigns;which cumulatively result in making available most of Left 4 Dead's content.Artistic work19 ⁄ 20Graphics / Visuals: Great◼◼◼◼◼◼◻For sure, the graphic quality of Left 4 Dead 2 is beyond satisfying, as far as the standards of its year of realease are concerned. The areas, the characters, the objects, all of them seem detailed and realistic, while the bloodbath that follows the Survivors' encounters with the Infected is always full of gore.Cinematics: Good◼◼◼The introduction video is just epic.Soundtrack: ★ Epic◼◼◼◼It is well-known that Valve is used to providing its audience with high-quality game soundtracks, and of course Left 4 Dead 2 is no exception; on the contrary, music is a big part of the game's experience, as it stimulates the desired emotions by creating an atmosphere full of suspense and agony. Notably, each Campaign is accompanied by its very own theme soundtrack, which is basically an adapted (to-the-style-of-each-Campaign) version of the original soundtrack. Also, Midnight Riders are here! A single exclamatory mark cannot compress the awesomeness of this hard rock band, created by Valve for the purposes of the series; a famous group that is widely-advertised in the whole game, and whose songs are playable in the in-game jukeboxes; they even have their own albums, concerts, merchandise, and website[www.midnight-riders.com].Audio: Good◼◼◼Going on, when it comes to in-game audio and sound effects Valve proves to be, once again, an expert creator, capable of stimulating the player's hearing, enhancing the whole experience acoustically.Voice acting: Good◼◼◼Keeping in mind the very few human characters encountered in the game, one can mainly focus on the 4 main Survivors, whose voice acting is professionally good.
Fun fact: Chad L. Coleman, Coach's voice actor, played as Tyreese in AMC's The Walking Dead.Misc.18 ⁄ 20Evolution◼◼◼◻Community: Nice◼◼Difficulty: Adjustable | Relatively challenging◼◼◼◼Duration: Very long◼◼◼◼Replayability: ★ Incredible◼◼◼◼File size: Relatively big◼◻Personal experience (fun, emotions etc)19 ⁄ 20▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁Version 2.1.1 .

												Ruined my gaming life and at the same time it really enhanced it. I met most people on my friends list on it and became really good friends with some of them.I'm mostly a Scavenge and Survival player. Yeah, I don't really like Versus and Campaign, which are the most played game modes. Being a Scavenge player, where the community is way smaller, I get to know basically everyone who plays it regularly and when I join a game (mostly on the Rooftop map) it's guaranteed that I will meet someone there who is either on my friends list or that I knew before just by playing. I'd say the best years to play this game mode where 2010-2013, it just died from there on to nowadays, but surprisingly, there's people who still play Scavenge, so there's always at least 1 game.Left 4 Dead 2's main problem, unlike most FPS games, isn't hackers. It's the community itself, specially the tryhards. Those morons that take video gaming more seriously than real life (well, they probably don't have a proper life to begin with anyway). Yeah, they get mad in public matches if people don't have over 2.000 hours and don't skeet every Hunter they see, even if their team is winning. You're going to have a hard time playing the PvP gamemodes, Scavenge and Versus, if you don't have at least 200 or 300 hours on Campaign and Survival you're going to be judged (if your profile isn't set to private or friends-only).Don't expect a horror shooting game, there's no horror elements in Left 4 Dead 2. The creepiest thing (if you can call it that) is the Witch, and even so, she's kinda... cute. Expect an action game with a toxic PvP community and a (mostly) friendly PvE one.			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a very fun adventure game in which you team up with 3 others and kill countless zombies as you fight for your survival. Utilise many weapons such as assault rifles, pistols, axes and even chainsaws. It has a good storyline as well, making the characters who need to survive quite interesting as they have to interact with eachother. While the zombie-killing is fun, after a while it will get reptitive and you'll run out of fun ways to kill zombies. Another downside is that you should really play it with others, as with bots it is really bad because they act like they have no brain. There are a good range of modes however, even ones when you get to control zombies!Pros:+Good variety of weapons and fun ways to kill zombies+Good story+Fun with 4 people+Good modesCons:-Can get repetitive, depending on how you view it-Bad if you're on your ownVerdict:9.1/10.0			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a sequel to the original Left 4 Dead, a zombie shooter set in a variety of locations. Each campaign has 4 survivors, who have to reach the safety vehicle or area on the other side and have to fight their way through tons of infected. There's also versus and a lot of other game modes.PROS: + Teamplay can make a real difference. Good communication and teamwork seem to be more important than skill+ Good replay value: the director spawns infected, objects, weapons and items randomly each time, making playing the same maps over and over less repetitive+ A balanced amount of weapons that satisfy in both audio and visuals+ A good variety of game modes, difficulties and alternate playstyles that can deliver a challenge or a different type of experience. Has expert realism gotten too easy? There's a bunch of mutations that step up the difficulty by a whole + This is a game that's very user-friendly in supporting the use and management of add-ons in a simple and clear-cut way instead of having to learn about managing files, extensions and whatnot. You can download, use and delete mods all without leaving the game and you rarely have to open any files on your desktop+ The Source engine and console make adjusting the settings to your likings easier and is a comfortable engine to play with+ Trading cardsCONS - L4D(2) is infamous for its toxic community, especially in VS. This is mainly because of how suitable this game is for trolls (friendly fire, suicides, etc.). Joining or starting public games has a fairly present chance of inexperienced, arrogant or annoying players, psychos, grievers or trolls joining and ruining the game. A lot of people are playing on difficulties that they cannot handle, sometimes solely for the sake of causing unrest. To gauge an idea of what this is like: our server's banlist has accumulated over 350 banned players in under a year - The maps can get repetitive after a while, despite the director randomizing entities - (Rare) crashes, glitches and disruptions in both sound and visual. This is partially related to add-on collisionIf you plan on playing L4D2, I highly recommend you friend some nice players, play with friends or play on a moderated server (admins that kick troublemakers), because at some hours, playing this game on the highest difficulty is near impossible due to the type of players mentioned above. Nevertheless, L4D2 is a great game that can be tons of fun and you'll likely keep coming back at it for many hours. Definitely a recommendation for players who enjoy teamplay.My rating: 9* About ""Product received for free"": I got this game for free during Christmas 2013, which makes me a Ghost of Christmas Present player.

IntroLeft 4 Dead, a series I simply cannot get enough of.As I wrote my ""extremely late"" review for Left 4 Dead 1, I figured I might as well do one regarding Left 4 Dead 2, in the same style. :)The GameDeveloped by Turtle Rock Studios and Valve itself, Left 4 Dead 2 is the sequel to Left 4 Dead.Bigger, better, more succesful (based on numbers, not my own opinion) than before!If you've read my Left 4 Dead review, most of these will be the same as it's basically the same game. ;DPros● Unique Cooperative Gameplay in every Gamemode! (Campaign, Versus, Survival, Scavenge)● The Lobby/Drop-in system works flawlessy allowing players to effortlessly finding a game.● Free DLC.● A New Gamemode! Scavenge!● Mutation System, play or create your own gamemodes!● Workshop!● Make your own Maps!● Low PC Specs required.● Get to play as Special Infected! (Yeah.. those Zombies..!) in Versus mode.● A bigger variety in Special Infected compared to Left 4 Dead● Very Easy to setup your own Dedicated Server.Cons● Players have to download Maps manually, they are unable to download from the Server they are joining, same goes for Custom Made mutations.● The Game is unpolished in regards to exploits and bugs, Valve has never responded to countless reports and complaints.● No Matchmaking, you're very likely to end up with very unbalanced teams when joining Versus games.● A weak Attempt at ""Clan/team Matches"" by introducing ""Team Versus"", ""Team Scavenge"" modes.● Ragequitting is not punished at all.The CommunityThe Community for Left 4 Dead 2 is very comparable to Left 4 Dead, in Public Games you can expect to be insulted and possibly even votekicked if you're underperforming in the eyes of your teammates. However, in Co-op gameplay this is a much less frequent occurence.There however is still a breathing Competitive Scene, this scene is much better in terms of actually being able to finish your games as well as making buddies and playing on much more balanced and difficult ""Gamemodes"".I'd advertise if I knew for sure it was allowed. :DCurrent Status of the GameAs of this post, Left 4 Dead 2 has an 30-Day Average of 9033 Players Worldwide.The game is definitely alive and has games to join all the time in my area. (West-Europe)Left 4 Dead 2 Costs $20 which is the same price as for its predecessor, Left 4 Dead.Final WordsLeft 4 Dead 2, in its current state is well worth the full $20, even if you're going for just a little bit of Campaign and Survival. The more friends you have to play this with, the more fun you'll have.● 5 Original L4D2 Campaigns.● 6 L4D1 Maps DLC. ● 1 The Passing DLC.● 1 Cold Stream DLC.			"

												Over 2000 hours and I still haven't reviewed this game! well here goes...Do you like zombies? Do you like guns? Do you like Mariocart? Do you like to spam right-click like your middle finger has Parkinsons? Well you are going to love this!L4D2 is a unique, fast paced twitch shooter with loads of replayability. Even if you get bored of the official valve content there are tons of fun community maps to try out. In particular I recommend Questionable Ethics and The Bloody Moors. Despite the zombie theme L4D2 is not really a horror game and the L4D2 campaign and characters in particular are pretty cartoonish compared to the darker design of the original Left 4 Dead. However, all of the L4D1 maps were ported over to L4D2 a long time ago now, so there isn't much need to buy the original unless you are really curious or nostalgic about it.The game is getting a bit old now with alot less people online than there used to be. Consequently mosty of the players you find online are either veterans/long term addicts of the game or newbies from the previous sale. This only really applies to the PvP modes of the game (Versus and Scavenge) but new players are going to have a tough time in public games because of this. L4D2 does not have a very high skill ceiling like Counter Strike or Quake but there is still a fairly steep learning curve to start with. In any random public game you are likely to be playing with players who have 1000+ hours who know the maps like the back of their hand and know all the various little tricks and strats. You will find them frustrating to play against and they will find it frustrating having you on their team. This is the kind of game where one player can really drag a whole team down so if you are that player you can expect to be kicked alot. If you are new you should start out playing versus with friends, or get onto some 10v10 commuinity servers where you can mess around without getting kicked from the game.People say that the public versus community is really terrible but I dont think it is any worse than other PvP games apart from the fact that some of the game mechanics specific to L4D2 make people rage such as the forced dependence on teammates and some of the inherent randomness of the game. In fact I would say that the versus community is better now that it was 4 years ago when the game was more popular. For example most of the time now people will 'ready up' before starting a round, whereas before it was normal to see people deliberately rushing out of spawn while players are still loading in. But yeah... if you are new you are going to need thick skin in public versus.Versus is definately the most replayable mode, and the reason why many people keep playing this game for thousands of hours, but it what I said above puts you off you can always stick to playing the co-operative modes which are slower paced and with more easygoing players. The exception to this is expert difficulty, where friendly fire damage is signifigant and effects playstyle alot. Because of friendly fire expert is also the biggest target for griefers. Playing alot of expert co-op will make you paranoid about teamkillers and you will start to accumulate a nice big blocklist.Anyway what I have written might come across as negative but I think it is honest view based on over 2000 hours of gameplay which by itself says alot about addictive and replayable this game is. I don't think I have ever played any other game for as many hours, and no other game has made me laugh or rage as much as L4D2.			"

												After looking through my most played games list I realised I owed it to the Left 4 Dead games to leave my positive review, even if it'll be lost in a sea of the other 150,000+ positive reviews. Left 4 Dead is built on a couple of basic but important principles: It's immediately playable even to new players, it's movie-esque and the sound, vision and events are important for suspense and tension during gameplay and it's absolutely hands-down a game that excels at cooperative dynamics and benefits from friendly banter.All these things combined mean that 8 years after release it's just as fun, and despite the fairly frustrating online playerbase and mindset, and some failings towards long-term play, it's still absolutely a game that you can dive right into at any time and have some good old fashioned fun.

												Has a very toxic community but it's very fun to play.I used to play this game back in 2009 on console when I was VERY young. Like 8 years old young. I also played the first Left 4 Dead game on console. (I used to be a console peasant T^T) and I moved onto PC in 2013.Lets talk about the community. It's very toxic. Whenever I join an Expert campaign, there's a griefer that's filling their teammates up with lead and doing all sorts of ♥♥♥♥ to make you have a bad experience. There are people who despise new players and they refuse to teach them all about The Left 4 Dead series. There are people who just randomly kicks people even though they haven't done jack ♥♥♥♥. I won't even go into detail about Versus mode.The game is pretty good. I prefer Left 4 Dead over Left 4 Dead 2 but this game is awesome. Unlike the first game, there's a Steam Workshop for it. You can reskin those ugly models. You can make your Left 4 Dead 2 scarier, or you could make it very humorous. Perhaps, make it a weeaboo's dream or make Team Fortress 2 characters fight hordes of Teletubbies with a Shrek tank running around while the TF2 characters shoot guns that go, ""PINGAS!""The game is very fun to play but recommend to play with friends. It's more fun to play with them.			"

It's not a bad game, it's just that every person you find on a server expects you to be 110% perfect that the game. If you don't do exactly your team mates tell you to do they will just kick you. If you don't kill someone with that death charge, they kick you. If you go decide to help a bot while you team leaves you behind, they kick you. If someone just feel like being a ♥♥♥♥, they kick you. If everyone like that guy who is going to kick you, they kick you. If you to play the game casualy, they kick you. If you did something you didn't know was wrong, they kick you. I you don't have enough hours, they kick you. If you die, they kick you. They kick you they kick you and they kick you. Thats all this game is is just joining servers and being kicked. Every other server I play on I get kick for just playing the game. It's not some online ranked game. It's a Multiplayer survival game meant for you to have fun, no to get kicked by perfectionist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who expect everyone to be good a game. I get if have a troll in your lobby, or a person keeps going afk, or they have a ping of 999, or if they are mic spamming, because thoes are reason to kick people.

												I was gifted this game by a friend, And I had a couple other friends who also Played L4D2, We were a squad of 4.How lucky i was to have friends to play with, The multiplayer community is ♥♥♥♥ING TOXIC.Didn't collect a gas can in scavenge? Votekicked.Decimated the other team as the tank in versus? Votekicked.Healed yourself when you were recently downed but didn't heal a kid who had 43hp and pain pills? Votekicked.Too good? Votekicked.Too new? Votekicked.Startled the witch but cr0wned her? Votekicked anyway.If you're looking for a good lobby, it's not common.I suggest before buying this game you have friends to play with, Solo is a dead end, Bots aren't fun.If you can find somebody with low hours and they're nice people, here's what you should do.Friend said new individual, and play friends only games with them, Repeat this short process until you've got a good group of 4.If you DO have friends to play with, Ignore this whole group building thing.From MY Experience with good friends and cutting out the short session i had with multiplayer and votekicking.I'd have to give this a solid 10/10.

												This is a really nice game - together or alone. Because even if you're just one player, there will be 3 mates with you, who are necessary because those badass zombies are in great MAJORITY. There are a lot of different types of zombies, some of them can only be defeated with teamwork. Some of the Levels are designed slightly creepy and all of them are having a different type of theme. A roller coaster, or the swamp, a storm at night? Everything's possible. But what's worth to buy this game, when you can't kill those guys? Well - you can! And to do so you can find a bunch of different weapons all over the maps. An Axe, Machete, Katana, and - of course - guns. A lot of guns. The story isn't anything really new, but for zombie-games there isn't much space to experiment with that. But it's not bad in any way.Final words: This game is much fun to play with friends, or all alone with the help of the your fellows. With a lot of different modes you can spend a lot of time in this great game and it's definitely worth it.			"

												A lot can be said about this game, but there's something specific I want to say about this game after seeing the popularity of recent multiplayer games like Evolve and Payday 2.Left 4 Dead 2 is a great example of replayability done right. It doesn't try to keep you playing with progression, but with sheer FUN. While a lot of online games these days will beat you over the head with an experience bar and taunt you with unlockables, Left 4 Dead 2 doesn't keep anything from you, and from the word go, you have access to whatever equipment you find randomly strewn across its maps. It focuses on making any given campaign run or round of versus unique and interesting, and you as a player get to enjoy the journey instead of simply anticipating the destination. This isn't a game where you grab the SMG because you want some kind of SMG bonus afterward, or you sneak past a sobbing zombie woman so you can get an experience bonus the next time you play. This is a game where you grab a shotgun because you want to shoot that Witch in her stupid, crying face.			"

												The fellow survivors and I hid in in the local burger joint. We were stuck in the middle of a thunderstorm so we had to  turn on the huge neon sign above it to call a boat for rescue.We survive the whole thing perfectly well, until the boat finally arrives and we find a huge beast of a thing, called a Tank, standing in our way. At that moment, we all knew it was everyone for themselves.The first dude runs for it, but gets pounced by a hunter.The girl runs for it and makes it.The third dude is about to run, but I shoot him in the face several times, not incapping him, but making him slow enough for the Tank to catch him. I use this time to escape.33/11 would kill teammate for boat again.			"

												TL:DR - Get it when it is on sale, only thing that keeps this going is what the community pumps out in the workshop. Not much I can say about this which many others have not.+ Plenty of modes+ Workshop+ Custom campaigns- Horrible community- Screaming kids- Admin abusers (not official admins)- VS is a kick simulator- Newbies that don't know what team-work isStill holds up to this day, I really like this game and glad I got it. Gotten some nice hours out of it though most of it is on multiplayer. On singleplayer it is bland. The bots tend to not help you or get stuck but are a good starting point but multiplayer is where you learn what is the best and worst thing to do per map.VS is still toxic as ♥♥♥♥, take a friend with you to be on your side otherwise you should expect kicks every 10 seconds because someone on your side is not happy with the way you play.Also expect some noobs to waste all your kits and still expect you to heal them with yours when they been incapped or my god they gone below 70HP and refuse to use pills. I just leave these wasters to die because they are not helpful, they do not listen and will most likely take your safe-room kit as well as any other kit they bloody find. Even if you do protect the they will use their kit first instead of pills and then need another kit later on which is not there.So both experts and newbies are toxic on this, experts because in VS they want you to do everything 100% their way without even telling you while SOME newbies refuse to listen and think only they are important enough to be healed, you are just there to carry their ♥♥♥♥ to the saferoom and die. They don't even try to save you.Oh and prepare for children to scream down their mics, play annoying music through it or refuse to mute their mic so you can hear their parents argueing in the background because gosh they think they need to broadcast it.Only thing that keeps me playing is the workshop, so many mods to customise your characters but also some pretty good campaigns, some original, some based off other games such as Resident Evil. They keep it fresh when bored of the official campaigns which can over-stay their welcome too easily or at least they do to me.			"

												I couldnt decide what to write in this review , so im gonna share with you guys my favorite apple pie recipe Enjoy! :Pastry2  cups  all-purpose flour 1  teaspoon salt 2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons shortening 4 to 6 tablespoons cold water Filling1/3   to 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup  all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/8  teaspoon salt 8 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples (8 medium) 2  tablespoons butter or margarine 1) In medium bowl, mix 2 cups flour and 1 teaspoon salt. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary).2) Gather pastry into a ball. Divide in half; shape into 2 flattened rounds on lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling.3) Heat oven to 425°F.

												Played it, loved it. So yes, where do I begin? This is probably the most teamwork-oriented game I'll ever play. Not even Team Fortress 2 can compare to the importance of teamwork in a game like this. I can't stress enough that spelunking alone will get you killed. Gameplay in general? It's alright. I'm no professional critic, but I can say it's simple enough to understand. Shoot zombies, get inside safehouses, try not to die.Oh and I love the voice talents. So many lines for performing a single action, like apologizing, getting saved, and even looking at safehouse graffiti.Good game. "

												Just as with the original Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2 is a first-person shooter which pits players against hordes of zombie-like enemies. It is set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic and focuses on four survivors who have to take on the infected specimens. These survivors must fight their way through levels, cooperate with one another, so that they can reach safe rooms that act as checkpoints, with the goal of reaching a rescue vehicle at the campaign's finale. Whereas the first game had a limited selection of weaponry, this sequel gives you multiple shotguns, multiple handguns, and multiple fully-automatic weapons, melee weapons as well as incendiary ammunition, explosive ammo and laser sights. You'll be putting these weapons to the test against common, uncommon and special infected (which  have higher intelligence, are more aggresive and more likely to attack, rather than passively sitting until disturbed). Four of these special Infected (the Hunter, Smoker, Charger and Jockey) are 'pinners' and require another Surviour to knock them off. The other ones (Spitter and Boomer) support the pinning infected, mainly because their attacks can help slow down the Survivors. The last two specials (Tank and Witch) are considered ""Boss infected"" as they have a very high amount of health, they spawn at the rarest rates and they can easily kill a Survivor in a matter of seconds. Like before, there are multiple difficulties such as an easy and normal one, serving as a good entry-level challenge for new players, advanced difficulty for more experienced players and and an expert one where you have to be extremely cautious when moving forward since witches can instantly kill you when starting them, health kits are extremely rare to find outside the saferoom and friendly fire inflicts half damage to the Survivors.There are thirteen playable official campaigns that take the survivors through a wide variety of detailed environments - from swamplands to a creepy carnival ground, from flooded suburbs to claustrophobic city streets. There are also several multiplayer mods such as:1.   Survival mode   - (A 4 player co-operative mode where survivors try outlast a never ending horde); 2.   Realism mode    - (With some changes to game mechanics, the hardest one off all) 3.   Realism versus mode  4.   Versus mode   - (Two separate teams of 4 players take turns playing as Survivors and Special infected, competing for the most points). 5.   Scavenger mode   - (Another 4v4 versus mode where survivors attempt to fill a generator with gas cans, scattered throughout a map while the infected team must work together to stop or delay the survivors from filling the generator).Overall, Left 4 Dead 2 was very much worth the purchase. The thing I like the most about this game is that it does promote teamwork (more than most of the games on the market). Players have to work together, healing, helping and protecting one another in order to survive.			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a wonderful game for what it has. It is a well made First person shooter by valve, who shows that they have the prowess to know what they are doing. Left 4 Dead 2 is capable of being played alone with bots, but the real charm lies with online play. While the general stance on pub quality is relatively neutral, it is great if you can ask some friends to join the harvests. Coop is the prominant gamemode, but mutations and versus are still fun gamemodes. Left 4 Dead 2 is also interesting to dig into for some lore, but that is an attribute more to Valve than to the game at hand. Overall, Left 4 Dead 2 is a great game for its price which can go on sale on the major sale events. It's features are great and you can emulate the original coop and versus matches through official mutations, so other than achievements, you're not missing much if you're tight on money. All of this is without mentioning the prominant moddng community who works hard at providing reskin mods and maps through the workshop. I highly reccomend this to anyone who wants a standard First person shooter and has a few friends willing to join the chaos.			"

												If I said L4D2 isn't a good game, I would be lying. Besides, what is my review compared to the fact that it has been one of the top-rated games of its era?Remember those horror movies involving zombies where the main characters run and hide when chased? Left 4 Dead 2 is nothing like that.In Left 4 Dead 2, when you see zombies, you run towards them.You shoot them, you cut them, you slice them, you dice them, you saw them apart, you burn them. Basically do anything to kick their undead asses so hard they'd wish they stayed in hell.And then they send the big guns against you. The special kinds that have special abilities to horrify you.And then you rinse and repeat. You blow them to smithereens, you smack them to kingdom come, you tenderize them.And when you can stand there in a group of 4, and the dead actually fears you, you'll know this is a game that screams:""Come at me, and we'll see who's the dead one.""

												Let me start with this: I love the L4D series; both games. The gameplay and various stories really tops it off.That's the sad part.Unless you decide that you want to play solo or maybe with some friends, don't bother with this game. It's really nice, and I mean REALLY nice to play offline, but any attempt to play online will be immediately refuted by the majority of players who happen to be super pro elitist ***holes. You will get kicked for everything, and I mean EVERYTHING. I've been kicked for opening a door, healing a partner, accidentally incapacitating a partner who was at 1 health and in the middle of the crossfire, using a med kit because I'm low on health, being pinned by a zombie, AND MY FAVORITE, being a f***king new guy. You CANNOT play multiplayer as a new guy because the elitists forget that you have to practice to get good. Seriously. The Community is by far the worst in current gaming history. Avoid them if at all possible.			"

												Just look at my playtime.Pros:- 8 survivors with distinct personalities and tons of lines- Neat soundtrack mixing an orchestra with traditional Southern instruments- 13 campaigns made of 2-5 maps each, each lasting around 30-60 minutes depending on your skill and play style. They're so detailed that after playing countless times, I'm still noticing new things. They include a hotel, city streets, sewers, a carnival, rock concert, forest, a mall, church, sugar mill, flooded streets... quite a variety there.- The ""director"" AI system changes things based how you play; Whether to spawn helpful items, or ease up on the zombies spawning, stuff like that. This, combined with branching paths, makes each playthrough of a campaign somewhat different.- Includes all of the original Left 4 Dead characters and campaigns.- A modest arsenal of guns, melee weapons, grenades and some special things including a chainsaw, grenade launcher and street-sweeping M60- An infinite supply of common zombies to shoot, bash, cut, burn, explode and dismember in many ways. Alone, they're mere cannon fodder, but they work together to slow or overwhelm the survivors.- Encourages working together. Wander off and you're bound to get killed.- 8 special zombies which pose unique threats. Every strategy the survivors use can be countered by a certain special.- Co-op for 4 players online or 2 player split-screen. (Some modded servers even support 8 survivors.)- Versus mode allows you to play as a special zombie, and work together to take down the survivors. Other modes include scavenge, sort of capture-the-flag with gas cans; and survival, where you hold off against the infected as long as possible. Also has lots of ""mutations"" which modify gameplay in different ways.- Still updated with bug fixes and additional modding support. Some long-term amusing bugs remain, but nothing which negatively affects gameplay.- Jaw-dropping amount of mods, and most importantly: campaigns! It would take me weeks to play through them all.Cons:- The AI is... not great. When you're playing against survivor bots, they can feel cheap. But when they're on your side, there are times when they'll just stand by and watch you die from a foot away. Playing with friends highly recommended.If you have 3 friends and love shooting zombies, you can't go wrong with L4D2.			"

												A lot of sequels try to reinvent the original game and fail miserably in the process. L4D2 doesn't have that ambition. It just took what made L4D great and designed new campaigns, new levels, new weapons. It actually almost feels like an expansion pack for the original game. Which is great if you ask me :-). If it isn't broken, don't fix it! If it's fun, don't change it.That being said, I didn't feel the characters to be as likeable as the original foursome. The level design is slightly underwhelming compared to the original game. But the new weapons and enemies definitely make up for it. "

												I absolutely love this game and is one of my favorite games of all time, so I'm giving this a positive review. That being said, I'll have to address the matter of this game that completely destroys it. A simple word, 'Community'. Out of all of the communities of games, movies, etc, this is the worst one I have ever came across. This community is full of elitists, ridden with them. They always kick you for doing the slightest thing wrong or not doing what they want you to do. For example; About to die and stops to heal = kick.Killing a zombie that someone else was about to kill = kick.Just missing a player as a charger = kick.Walks out of spawn and immediately gets pounced = kick. So why do I recommend this game you ask? It's because of the game itself. I only play this game with friends (for obvious reasons) and that is a highly fun experience. If you are planning on going on a pub server, bring around two other people with you, therefore you have less chances of getting kicked.			"

												I explained the majority of how Left 4 Dead as a series works in my Left 4 Dead 1 review here so for this review I'm mainly going to be talking about the new features of Left 4 Dead 2.The new campaign maps look absolutely wonderful and they're brimming with great atmosphere and are very screenshot worthy and the graphical designs on guns have improved making it more enjoyable to wield them. Melee weapons have been introduced and it's a nice change to switch to a melee weapon instead of always using firearms although it probably isn't going to prove very useful if you're playing a difficult difficulty unless you run out of ammo on your primary weapon. However the chainsaw is extremely helpful for tearing through waves of zombies and it's probably one of the most fun things you can do in the game. L4D2 introduced new special infected including the spitter, the charger and the jockey. The spitter was a great addition and is an interesting and fun asset to the game, the charger is decent and it's fun trying to avoid its charging attacks but I felt as if the jockey wasn't really necessary and the game might have done better without it. The scavenger hunt didn't account for many hours of playtime since I found it rather dull. A team tries to collect as many gas canisters as possible and attempts to return them to their base to fuel up a generator while the special infected team tries to prevent them from fueling the generator. The mode was an interesting concept and fun for a while but got stale quickly and would have preferred to play something else, retreiving gas cans and getting attacked by a special infected eventually becomes tedious and annoying. But all in all I recommend this game to Left 4 Dead fans and first-person shooter fans alike. :) Probably should have talked more about the characters but the characters don't add much to the game in my opinion, it's not like it's story based.

												Perfect party game that is really, really good if you play it with friends because alone it´s good but it doesnt make that much fun and it gets boring. You can play competitive, campaign, versus ( humans vs. infected) ;), camapign solo etc. also there is a steam workshop that gives you so much extra content. The community is still revealing many mods for this game.  All in one a good game to play with friends  :).  8/10			"

												If you wanted to buy this game, take into account this.It depends fully upon how you plan to play.With friends?Sure, it'd be great if you got friends that you know will play with you in private.Without friends?No, do not try to play the game generally most of the time you'll encounter a very salty hate filled community of vote-kick spammers/whiney players but man, it's fun playing versus against randoms with a full team at your side.""salty community""So the game it'self, well it's left 4 dead it's fun and all got lots of mod maps too for various modes.It's a co-op game so singleplayer is a little tasteless to try, but it's a love-hate relationship if I ever saw one.You'll love it if you got a group with you, say three of your best friends who know how to play well but as always it can enduce hate and overall 'salt' people from being nice to rude [though that may be a understatement].For the average person who plays this game and plays without friends [beneath three of your friends agree to play with you] at their side, it's a bad idea to try playing.But if your smart like most of my friends, you'll play alongside your buds and generally do well and have fun ruining people's days if you play your team vs randoms.I wish VALVe had a no/neutral/yes in their rating system....

												I've had this game for year's, I got it back on steam over a year ago and been playing around on it some and decided to finally do a review. Well this is a all around extremely fun game, it has multiple campaign's along with 4 survivor's and tons of weapon's from melee to sniper rifle's to use, along with bomb's for you to use aswell. This game has ton's to do in it, and almost never get's old by far the best zombie game of it's time, even though the community isn't the best just getting some friends together makes this game a whole lot more fun, there's lots of challenges and mode's you can play on, along with a steam workshop to change up how the game looks.Left 4 dead 2 is a game I personally would recommend for anyone, it's fun, looks good, and has a all around great experience, you have multiple hours of mission's and campaign's to do along with different modes such as Versus or Mutation, or for a bigger challenge realism and expert, there's lots of infected type's in this game even the common infected can change depending on which map you're playing on, there's a lot of varieity in weapon's you can use and items to use in the game, you can use something from a Ak, to a pump shotgun, or a baseball bat to a fireaxe. This game has a lot to offer for anyone and will provide lot's entertainment and challenge's for them.			"

												This has to be the best, most original, zombie survival based game to ever be brought forth to the gaming community. I will argue nothing less; this is the best zombie survival game I have ever come across, you can't dislike this game! Every aspect of this game is lovable, between the four witty unique characters, the eerie plot of the story themed campaigns, and the various gamemodes, weapons, and special infected. Left 4 Dead deserves every award it recieved.All in All Left4Dead2 is the best Most Original Zombie Game9/10 From MeSweep "

												Against not calming down delights concerning Left 4 Dead a little bit the strange intention of Valve to let out continuation only in a year after the original sounded. Fans fairly assumed that under the guise of the second part to us will offer the same Left 4 Dead only improved and finished. Actually, so it also turned out – here only completions so change Left 4 Dead 2 that after a game couple of hours in it already there are no wish to remember all the charges at all. History repeats itself. In Valve didn't begin to invent any fancy plot, it here it is simple to anything. Survived again four, around again the zombie and to reach a quiet place, it is necessary to pass five levels, each of which to a limit is saturated with dangers of death. Were replaced unless scenery – in the second part they any more so gloomy, we should spend a lot of time and on the open spaces filled in with the sun. However, and this change is made not for appearance, and for the sake of gameplay improvement. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).			"

												I'm having a blast playing this game. I can't believe I've had it so long in my library and never touched it. Pros:Very, very challenging.A lot of replay value.Team work is needed, communication is key.Very tactful / tactical. If you think you're going to run around in this game blasting zombies, you're in for a big surprise. Check all your corners and watch your six!The AI is not too terrible and can hold its own on Expert.Many game modes to choose from.The Expert mode does not bend over for casuals like some other games in the same genre.A healthy player base even after 7 years.Cons:Team Killing. There are a lot of trolls in this game that will join your game and TK you. I've experienced at least one per gaming session. This can be very frustrating if trying to do a map on Expert. It'd be nice if there was a Ricochet option (whatever damage you deal to teammates is done back to you instead) that was on by default.Toxic community. Playing on VS is a sure-fire way to get insults hurled your way -- even if you go through the entire campaign on expert. They don't tolerate beginners at VS even though they were beginners once.For maps that have require gathering scattered items during the middle of a Panic event, the AI is useless, making these events virtually impossible on Solo.The AI will stay back and fight rather than follow you and kite. This is mainly important when dealing with a Tank.Weapons feel rather bland, but they'll grow on you eventually.If you cancel a reload on Expert, you'll have to play out the entire reload animation all over again and your magazine count will be at 0 even if you had at least 1 bullet in it before.

												950+ Hours and counting.This sequel is #1 on my list of Recommended Games. The Left 4 Dead Series is an instant classic, released 7 years ago and it still holds up. Play alone or play with your friends (or strangers), you will enjoy this game for countless hours. L4D2 is an improvement to an already fantastic and entertaining game. Make new friends, or lose some, the game focuses on cooperative gameplay that will teach you how to be patient and make you a great team player. You can download new maps and customize the whole game with mods from the workshop. This is the Best Zombie Co-op game ever! Here are some pros:+Easy mechanics, no boring story-line+Community is alive and well (90% of the people on my friends list are from this game).+Endless mods on the Workshop. It's like walking into a grocery store.+Funny and witty Character Lines.+Melee Weapons+More Blood+New Survivors, New Campaigns, New Zombies.+Achievements that you will enjoy hunting for.+Cool Easter Eggs and Movie references.+Random jump scares every once in a while.+Boomer is still UglyI only have one Con though:-GOOD GUY NICK!!!10/10 Would kill all sons-a-♥♥♥♥♥es again!

												I can honestly say that Left 4 Dead 2 would be my favourite zombie multiplayer game right now. It's a sequel to Left 4 dead. Same concept but more features added. It adds newer maps, different characters, more playable special infecteds, and a bunch load of more weapons to slaughter zombies with. You basically travel through different areas with your teammates trying to find an escape route. What more can you say about it? It's a fun coop game where you can play with your friends or any other online players from across the world.     Besides from just going to different saferooms and finding an escape vehicle on a finale campaign on the same maps, there are other gamemodes you can play to eliminate the boredom. Survival is a great and challenging gamemode where your teammates and you have to try to survive on a map for as long as you can with the resources that will be provided around the map. Great mode for strategy and setting a goal for surviving for maybe longer than 10 minutes or even an hour. The longer the time, the more crucial it'll get. Versus is another gamemode you can also try out. Probably is the most popular and playful gamemode in the game. It's a fun and competitive game which consist of two teams. One as special infecteds and one who plays as the survivors. After completing a map, both teams will rotate positions depending on who won last round. The team with the most points after completing the finale will be declared as the winner. This I believe is the only gamemode where you actually have the ability to play as a special infected which is a fun feature in the game.     With some of the updates that Left 4 Dead 2 offered us, you can actually have the ability to play as the old characters and the old maps from the first Left 4 dead. This means that there are more maps for you to try out and more characters for you to select. You don't even need to purchase the first Left 4 Dead. Also adds two extra maps for you to play on such as ""The Sacrafice"" played by the Left 4 Dead characters and ""Cold Stream"" played by the Left 4 Dead 2 Characters.     If you get bored of just playing normal vanilla games, you can try out some of the special steam group servers. These servers are made by other people where they can provide special features in the game that originally aren't in the game. They bring out a new level of fun and diversity. A fort spawner server for Survival where you can build a fort/shelter to help you fight away the zombies. An RPG leveling system server for Campaign and Versus where you can level up your character and acquire unique  perks and abilities to make you much stronger to slay the infected.     I met most of cool online friends on this game. It has been here for a while now and is still a popular game to this day. I would extremely recommend getting this game if you're into horror, fun or just love smashing zombies with a frying pan. It's only $21.99, which is fairly a cheap price for a great game.			"

												""FIRE FIRE FIRE!"" ""BLACK MAGIC! THE FIRE JUST APPEARED UNDER MY FEET! HEEEELLPPP MEE......"" ""WHO THREW THE MOLOTOV?!""- What people usually say when I throw a Molotov at their feet and watch them burnLeft 4 Dead 2, even though it's a game about zombies and all that surviving and the end of the world apocalypse thing, is pretty silly. More to that later on. Right now we start off with the most important part of the review, the gameplay.Gameplay: It's fun. You get to kill hundreds of zombies with guns and FIRE and the most fun weapon in the game, the chainsaw. Helping your team out by whipping out your chainsaw and going chainsaw first in the horde is awesome. Its makes you feel like an immortal badass coming to save your teammates by cutting through those zombies and showing the tank who's the best. And that all feels great! Music: It has the creepy, zombie like feel to it. It just feels......like you’re in an apocalypse and there's no hope of surviving. It's that sad, zombie-like, songs that make you feel..........in that moment. Like you're there with what could be the survivors of the zombie apocalypse that will get through this chapter in human history! It feels like you're there, in the moment, in that place. And all that feels creepy and awesome at the same time.Community: There always will be noobs in the game, but that's alright since there are more people who know what they're doing and you have friends. The friends who sometimes screw you over, but always try to help you. If you're friends are not like that. I dont think you have the friends you should have. This game is so much fun with friends though. Valve did a amazing job of making you feel accomplished in there games, and this makes you feel accomplished.Graphics: They’re good. Pretty normal. Mods and add-ons: Who are you if you don’t play this game with mods? Do you know what the meaning of fun is? A doge flashlight, Coach in a shirt with cheeseburgers on it, and Nick as Nicolas Cage with Cage’s heads in random places around his shirt are one of the many. Mods are love, mods are life.What makes this game silly?Besides killing hundreds of zombies with a frying pan? Mods. There are so many silly mods out there for Left 4 Dead 2.What shouldn’t I get this game?If you don’t have many friends who have this game or aren’t willing to buy it or just don’t want to play with you. It can be tough playing this game along or with strangers who don’t talk much.Ending words:If the things I said about this review makes you want to be a silly badass, then get this game! I don’t see reasons unless don’t have many friends who have this game or any of the other reasons.7/10“Pills here”*Gaben voice* Thanks! And have fun! "

Vote kicked!Don't get me wrong, this is an absolutely amazing game, if there was a ""neutral"" button, I'd totally click that, but if you really want to have a good time, play with your friends. Otherwise finding a server with decent people on is very hard. "

												This was the first game I bought for Steam. I had played the first one on Xbox for a little bit but never got to play often so I bought the second one for PC. I absolutely love this game (over 900 hours says something) This is a fun game to play, downloading mods, maps, and meeting some interesting people to play with. Playing with people is probably what makes me love this game so much because of how easy it is to make a new friend (or enemy) One of my favorite all time games. Definitely get it if you have the chance.			"

												The best cooperative game in the world, without a doubt.I don't know how to explain it- with this gaming series Valve created their own genre. It looks old and cliched, with the zombies, promises of teamwork and lots of guns, but ignore that: it's a surprisingly refreshing concept done in such an original way that there is nothing to compare it to. It was well received but I still think that this game was underrated. Left 4 Dead 3, if it ever comes out, will tip the world on its head. Best start preparing for it now with L4D2!The game DEMANDS teamwork, and actively encourages it. There is nothing to gain from running on ahead and leaving others behind, you're all in this zombie apocalypse together. It's amazing how you can join a server with 3 random people and within the space of a couple of hours, get to know each of them well enough that you want to add them all to your friends list.Much like GTA 5 or the Sims, this game has universal appeal. Yup, girls enjoy it too. I'm not going to say anything since I'll likely unintentionally come across as sexist, but I'll simply say that it's a testament to this game that everybody can enjoy it. I reckon that my parents would too if they would see past the gore.It may look as though it's you versus zombies, but you're really up against 'The Director'. It is a mysterious, invisible force who decides where to leave weapons and items lying around in the level. If you're doing too well, it'll chuck a crowd of zombies at you. 'The Director' shapes the pacing and feeling of the game and makes each play-through different to the last. It adds enormous replayability to a game that's already bursting with features and game modes.Oh yes, this game includes everything from the first game (rendering it completely obsolete), as well as 4 new characters with their own campaign spanning several separate worlds. You now have melee weapons, chainsaws, grenade launchers, vials-of-sick and deagles to aid you in your struggle against the undead. And The Director.But don't worry- the zombies have some new tricks up their saggy-skin sleeves as well. You have 6 special infected who are a match for lone humans, as well as sitting and walking witches and the almighty tank. You have armoured zombies who can only be shot from the rear, mudmen who scuttle quickly below your vision and smear your view and industrial workers with shiny jackets that make them sitting ducks. Idiots.You'll begin to fear the groan of the zombies. You'll get goosebumps at the sound of the musical cues. You'll love the sight of the saferoom and get a warm fuzzy feeling from using your medikit to heal a team member. This game has been a staple of my weekend nights for years and I'm still not tired of it. It's the perfect LAN game and as if the game wasn't good enough already, it also has a versus mode where you take in turns to be the special zombies and must stop the humans from achieving what ever it is those foolish creatures do when the world ends. I haven't played this mode nearly as much as I'd have liked and the idea of it still gets me excited all of these years later.In terms of fun / exciting / scary / frustrating things that you can squeeze into an hour of gameplay, Left 4 Dead wins hands down. The only down-side? The community isn't what it used to be. It's a real shame when you look at the server list and find so few people still playing. Expert mode is nigh on impossible to complete without some old hardcore friends joining to lend you a hand. You can forget expert realism!Even without real people, you can still play the campaigns against bots. The game is still worth it for that alone, though of course it is better with other real people. Do yourself a favour if you haven't already and give this game a go. There really isn't anything as polished or as well designed as this game and Valve must be very proud of themselves for making it first.			"

												Fun? It really depends on the type of server and type of people u meet there. I've met the worst and the nicest people out there. The worst - being those extremely rude,self-centred and intolerant people who kicks anyone who isnt perfect in their eyes. The nice - being those who help and give chances to new players. As a whole, l4d2 is a really fun game, despite times where u meet nasty people.			"

												Awesome zombie coop game. Even old, I still got some good fun moments with my friends playing some campaigns and versus sometimes; since I'm not into versus gamemode that much.You will get addict to this game for a time, then take a long break after hours and hours playing the same maps - but thanks to the Workshop, you can subscribe to a tons of mods, maps and skins for your own gameplay style. There are yet popular servers of 4x4 ; 10x10 coop styles.Again, Left 4 Dead 2 it's like an ""upgraded"" version from the L4D1: more special infected zombies, maps, new characters and you can still play the maps and the old characters from the first game. I strongly recommend you to buy this one first since it's better than L4D1. The workshop keep this game alive I believe. Enjoy!9.5/10			"

												Are you looking for some zombie-survival fun with your friends? (Not looking at you, Walking Dead. Your game is boring!) Wait no more! This is what you and your friends are looking for. Play Campaign Mode, where you and your friends must pass through many areas from a map, full of hordes to shoot in their faces, and escape from the map. Just like a badäss!Play Survival Mode, where you and your friends must survive as many time as possible. Making you a time-attacking badäss!Play Mutation Mode, where you have many different ways to play and you must prove Chuck Norris how a mighty badäss you are in many ways!Play Versus Mode or Scavenge Mode, where in both modes you can be in the human team or in the zombie team, regardless of which team you are, your victory makes you more badäss!Don't miss the chance! If you miss it, we're going after you! Bring your friends, bring your colleagues, bring your mother, that's right, your mother!

Play it alone and this game is really good, play it with friends and it becomes awesome !From the moment you leave the safe house to the final rescue chopper, you are completely dependent on each other. Without your friends, you're dead. It's a cooperative FPS game you know.And remember, play together or die alone.9.8/10			"

												It's zombies vs humans so brace yourself! And what makes this game a one of a kind? Besides there are several titles in the same genre with similar elements. Let me first point out the 'good' in the game. Valve indeed outdid themselves with a variety of special infected each with unique ability and style. The common infected rush in hordes and are super fast on feet. It's thrilling!All maps, single or multiplayer are campaign styled which means they are huge and you navigate across them. Like an added bonus, nothing is as exciting as a speed run and dodge through hordes of infected. What's more fascinating is the community mods and servers that offer custom gameplay experiences. The first person shooter is simple to grasp with absence of any hud clutter. Player interaction with health and healing makes it a fabulous team work experience and sometimes demanding as in the realism mode.Now let me point out the 'bad'. It's valve engine and thus is never bug free no matter how many patches they release. While a good teamwork makes the gameplay exciting, some community servers offer cancerous and salty players that just restort to team killing and notoriety. Reputed servers are known for weeding out such players and keep a balanced gameplay.Nevertheless, the first thing you do is jump straight into one of many community servers for coop campaign and play wisely. You wanna avoid accidental team killing and straying far away from the team while providing support as much as possible. Sure, you may also wanna start farming for points whilst your mates are left for dead and still complete the campaign like a pro. You either die a hero or live long enough to be the villain!Rated 8.5/10			"

												In this game you will be introduced with a high-school football “Coach” but with a bad knee, a cold and sarcastic gambler and con artist Nick, Rochelle who is a low level production assistant and reporting on the evacuation for local TV station and a friendly mechanic Ellis.As a start, the four survivors found themselves at an abandoned hotel roof by the rescue chopper. This is the start of Dead Center. So, they decided to reach the local mall where a second CEDA evacuation point is located. By their way after finishing correspondence with gun shop owner Whitaker, they discovered that the mall is overrun by infected. At such a situation Ellis helped the group to use a stock car and to travel towards New Orleans, probably the last standing city of America.The Passing stands in between Dead Center and Dark Carnival just after The Sacrifice. The four of the L4D2 survivors when arrive at the bridge of Rayford they meet Francis, Louis and Zoey. Since they need to cross the bridge so they four found the other way. After fighting their way through a wedding reception of witch bride, the streets and under the river tour they meet up again with the original survivors who provided covering fire while filling up the generator or lowering the bridge.Dark Carnival starts in a highway completely blocked by ditched vehicles. Starting from there survivors reached at an abandoned amusement park. At the park stadium Coach found a plan to use a large scale light show used by The Midnight Riders to signal the rescue chopper.Yet bad luck… they found the chopper pilot is infected! Naturally, Nick killed him and it crashed so also Swamp Fever starts. So, crossing the swamps the group finally arrives at plantation mansion and makes radio contact with Virgil, a boat captain. But his boat starts to run low on diesel on the way to New Orleans. Hard rain starts, the survivors go to shore at Ducatel. Crossing a witch infested sugarcane mill finally they get gas from gas station and return back with fuels to signal Virgil.Virgil drops the group at New Orleans where military is evacuating civilians across a bridge. But the four discovered that the city is completely overrun by infected and so the military is actually leaving the city before it is destroyed by air strike. However, survivors managed to reach the bridge and made contact with the military. Then crossing the bridge they were evacuated by chopper and the bridge was destroyed with the end of The Parish.All the best so far but the day is important because we have night!!! :) I don’t mean this for zombie apocalypse though!! :) So, foxed? :-D Well, you may encounter various types of trolls (special infecteds? :d), ... ... etc. etc. in the community when you will want multiplayer but just don’t let them feel you down ever to enjoy the thrills of the game because I assure you they are never more than a few. :)So, don’t you want to experience all these in more details playing the game by your own? I wanted all these learnings and hope you too. :)			"

												It remains, and rightfully so, one of the best CoOp games of all times. Of course, as time passes graphics and some of the mechanics have become outdated - but the Steam Workshop makes sure that you can form and shape it into the game you want. As such, it is still worth to be played today.However, I want to encourage you to look for friends that are playing with you, as my experiences with public lobbies have been... mixed. If you wanna play on your own, the teammate AI is still acceptable.			"

												Want to play with friends and survive in a zombie apocalypse?  Then L4D2 is a game for you! I always had fun with a friend when playing online and it's easy to create your own lobby. Noteworthy, the more friends playing, the better. Having the  Director avaliable to change the gameplay everytime you play also helps to make sure the game doesn't becoming too boring. You can also crank up the difficulty for a challenge (be warned though that if you're playing in expert mode, bring 3 other friends)! One issue I had with this game were the origin of the weapons (in other words, the way the weapons were held). The original game was fine but now, they're too centered in the screen and/or take up too much space (like the hunting rifle). However, this issue can be ""fixed"" in the workshop by downloading custom content and there's even an add-on that re-origins the default weapons. If you cannot find something in the workshop that you want/like, don't worry as it's very easy to install custom add-ons (from other websites) through the L4D2 file directories. There is another problem I keep facing when playing online in public lobbies. Some players should have practiced more and adjusted to the game by playing offline but instead, they decided to rush in and don't provide too much help due to their lack of experience. Sometimes, there are trolls too and it may be necessary to kick them. The worst issue I had was versus in which players kept on leaving after dying as survivors. Still, this is a good game to play with friends and I recommend it.			"

												Man, all you ♥♥♥♥ are ♥♥♥♥ at this game, the only reason I still play it after the huge give away apocalypse (may god have mercy on our souls) is to make your experience of this game worse. Though this might only be applied to the Versus mod it's worth every second. Do not believe that I enjoy it any more than you do because you ♥♥♥♥ are on my team as well ruining my experience while having to defend you a bazillion times only to get kicked because I get accused of hacking by 1 hour players  (whom obviously can tell, because lets face it, everybody have the right to show their opinion and force their unexperienced beliefs on to other scrubs) or that my playstyle differs from that of a noob.Why the ♥♥♥♥ do I even bother, there's something called confogl out there and it exists for a reason, to keep you noobs at your place, not in one single point in your lifetime will you ever amount to anything in this game, I would suggest for you to keep playing campaign like I did for a longer of period of time and enjoy it with your ""FRIENDS"".I hope to see you all out there whomever plays with the Download Location (UK - London) and I hope we can get along. Yeah right, you really think that'd ever happen? I'll keep joining your servers only to find out that the other team only made it by 50 points and say to myself, why don't I go play confogl, this is pointless. But then I'd say, no, I'm doing this because I want people to believe that I am a narcissistic ♥♥♥♥ who don't do anything else but hack and cause a commotion.So, that was my review, and here are my humble scores :)Hit registration gets 2 out of 5 in public games, 4 in Hyper-VCommunity gets 1 out of 5 for obvious reasonsAl-qaeda gets 2 out of 5 for not trying hard enoughPubstompers get 5 out of 5 because they're with the right causeMedkits get 2 out of 5 because they're helping noobs succeedMouse-2 (m2) or Bash gets 5 out of 5 because it's underrated/// Your personal ""super-just-saiyan"" who've used the name holocaust for over 3 years so no, steam won't ban you for using this so called ""Offensive"" namehttp://x2.fjcdn.com/comments/5173596+_50c6ebb796c4b2f0785f073aa9f3edc9.png "

The Physics are hyper-realistic, the textures are flawless, and on top of all that beauty lies the fact that it runs very smoothly on my computer.

												So. First off, if you're looking for a hardcore, serious, emotional zombie game with a realistic storyline, KEEP LOOKING! This game has a bit of an Arcadish feel to it, as none of the characters are really serious about saving their own asses. Instead, they make funny remarks at activities like killing zombies. This game is awesome, except for one thing. THE FRIGGIN' COMMUNITY!!! Unless you have amazing skills or some friends to play with, do NOT buy this game. As soon as you make 1 mistake in  a Versus game, everyone calls you something like Dumbass! or F*cking Idiot followed by an amazingly fast votekick that litterally EVERYONE votes yes for. That's really what I hate, and it made the game extremely annoying. The game also gets very repeditive and boring. So, in summarry it's an awesome game, but you NEED friends to play it. So, unfortunately, I will have to rate this game down. I'm really torn about it, but the community sucks. It makes it IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY!!!			"

												One of my favourite games ever. 9/10.Great multi-player co-op game that still has a ton of replay value, six years later. Where it really shines is in Versus mode, where teams play against each other, taking turns playing as the Special Infected.  Left 4 Dead 2 is simply a must-have for all survival horror enthusiasts. The new game modes and the usual mix of adrenaline and co-op gameplay is the living(dead) proof that a sequel doesn’t always have to change its original nature to be enjoyable, very enjoyable!Before playing Versus mode, however, make sure you have played through Campaign mode completely at least once. Of course, story is for single player games, and L4D2 certainly isn't that. To get the most out of the game, you need to play it with three other people, especially on higher difficulties where the AI companions are all but useless. They'll do a good enough job at shooting zombies, but often get sidetracked at killing a few straggling common infected, while your busy fighting a Tank. Or, they'll continually shout ""We need to stick together!"" when you try and keep moving, but they just won't follow you. The most frustrating is during the game's gauntlet events, where you have to go and turn off something like an alarm, and the AI just won't keep up. If you don't have access to Xbox Live, Steam then L4D2 will get old really quick. I have played the game for over 500 hours on Steam. I have also played the game for 100 hours on Xbox. So I do have enough time to make a review on the game. With friends, the game is still a blast. The AI Director returns, and again changes the maps according to how well you are doing. If you're full on ammo and health packs, prepare to meet up with a host of special infected. Be on the verge of death with only a frying pan, however, and you won't face quite as many. And nothing is as exhilarating as going into a room to find a pipe bomb in one game, and trying to grab it in another game only to find a Witch sobbing in the corner.Versus mode returns, and is still the most fun of the bunch. In the eight player mode, four people are survivors, and four are the infected. All of the special infected return from the first game, including the repulsive Boomer, the ferocious Tank, and the creepy Smoker. Three new infected join the roster this time around, and fit in just great. The Charger is able to pick up a survivor, carry them, and pummel them into the ground. The Spitter spits deadly poison that lingers on the ground. And the Jockey can jump on a survivors back, steering them into danger zones such as fire or a Spitter's poison patch. Each type of special infected are unique and fun, and the addition of three more is just icing on the cake. Like the first game, playing as the special infected is still a blast - there's nothing quite like setting up an ambush with your fellow zombies to kill the survivors in Versus mode.Survival mode makes another appearance as well. Released as DLC in the first game, it comes to L4D2 mostly unchanged, having the four survivors face waves of endless infected coming to save them, with rescue never coming. It's fun.The environments are much more detailed and atmospheric. The rain effects are especially mind-blowing, and can make the threat of an oncoming zombie assault quite stressful when you can't see five feet in front of your face. The ways in which zombies die are also gruesomely spectacular. With the introduction of melee weapons, you can hack at certain body parts of the infected, taking off a leg, chunk of head, or outright decapitating them. Bullets also tear off flesh to reveal ribcages, and chainsaws literally rip the infected apart. There are some nagging clipping issues, such as having zombies' heads protrude through walls, or being able to walk through your allies.The sound direction is stellar, from the powerful gun shots to the creepy, ambient groans and moans warning you of nearby special infected. The soundtrack is fitting for the American South, but could've been longer, as it repeats itself too often. Though the core gameplay remains pretty much the same, there is more than enough new content and improved action to make this zombie apocalypse highly recommendable.The fact that there are addons makes the game even more enjoyable. Oh. One negative thing? I am seriously getting fed up with most of the L4D2 public community. Just blocked my 40th person, they spent the past two hours trash talking everyone on my team with horrible insults and claiming that we all hack (all because I shot a noisy boomer through a wall). People who join, suicide, then leave. Who accuse others of hacking. Who call ""RAGE"" every time someone leaves. Who blame the server for every failure. Who swap while people are still loading in, resulting in the affected player getting kicked by the swappers team.Oh and don't even get me started on the ""competitive"" players... (not to generalize... bad apples, you know...)It's not very often you get to meet nice, kind, great teamplayers. But once you do, it's a blast! Search for groups who focuses on having fun rather than winning.  It's worthwile. Trust me. Slash and hack!			"

												Hi everyone. I have to say that L4D2 is a very fun game to play especially with friends. I'll try to be as polite as possible. But I have to say this. Recently, there are more and more stupid & unreasonable players. And what I meant by that?Newbies and laggers, I'm fine with them. No harm at all, we can play slow and we can help each other up when we are incap. ( EMPHASIS: THESE 2 KINDS OF PLAYERS I'VE MENTIONED ARE FINE. THEY ARE COOL. I DONT MIND PLAYING WITH THEM)What I have to say is the community (NOT ALL), this community is getting more and more ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I was playing this game awhile ago, I was playing a public modded server. I saved like 3-4 players when they are incap. And there are players who keeps friendly firing me when I was saving the incap ones. It's fine still. But after I saved them, the players who friendly fired me voted to kick me. And everyone literally pressed F1. And I got voted out from the game, I saved people. And right after I got kicked, the players impersonated me. !@#$%&(*&^$#$% I'm so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.So.. Guys, I would say that this game's community has ruined this game. Directly or indirectly, before getting this game, please think twice, or even thrice. Unless you are prepared to get kick by doing good deed and get shot down by stupid players.			"

												This is one of the best game ever. Plenty of fun with friends and a very enjoyable versus mode. The coop system is the best ever seen in the games history. The animations are incredibly fluid, some of the best I've seen so far in a game. The dialogues are great, the characters say a lot of different things and are never annoying or ripetitive. Definitely worth for buying. I'm not what you would call a ""video game person"", yet after playing this once, I've been obsessed with this game. Much better than the sequence (card game) and the infected characters are definitely worth the time ESPECIALLY THE SURVIVORS SINCE THEY'VE ADDED WORKSHOP , WHERE YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE THEIR CLOTHES THE GUNS GOD ITS EVERYTHING. Multiplayer! cooperative or competitive! Teamwork actually means something here. You can do more than just shoot guns. Controlling special abilitied Zombies is a unique experience. SCAVENGE MODE (OMG) You are not only feel like a member of your team, you need to cooperate every time and your team needs to coop back aswell or your brains will get eaten (kidding or then ""you wont get any chance against the other team (if they know the game more than u do) , btw there's always TUTORIAL about scavenge so u can go ahead and see those. PLAYING WITH FRIENDS AND THE ONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO PLAY IT WILL possibly the best teamwork oriented game ever, certainly the best with a still thriving community.			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is the best zombie game.  The mass-horde, shoot 'em up style of gameplay works extremely well with the quality of game for which Valve is known.  AI on Left 4 Dead 2 is not without its hiccups, but it does a very nice job in place of breathing players.  Online play adds a whole new dimension to the game with a multitude of different modes, ensuring that the game never quite gets old.			"

												Left 4 Dead gave me my start in online gaming.  My noobiness was easily forgiven by the zombies, however, if you play with other players, be prepared to hear a little bit of criticism, especially if you do versus.  Overall, I really enjoy this game and I am quite pleased that Valve incorporated the first Left 4 Dead maps into it. However, the original maps are starting to get a little old despite the recently added Cold Stream, but, having said that, this is still one of my most favorite games.  So, if you are looking for a good game to play with other people and have a few drinks, Left 4 Dead can offer you a good time!Still hoping for a third installment! L4D3! L4D3! L4D3!! :D			"

												I gave this game several tries, but I just can't recommend this game. It's very difficult to finish a Versus match without having the cancerous community kick you. This is the perfect example of a great game ruined by its community- I have never seen the kick option be so abused in a game before.If you have a group of friends with you, then you should be set. Playing by yourself is another thing. You will be kicked constantly- often for no reason at all. I actually found myself kicked for healing one teammate over the other(who were both in the same shape).Save your money and time- this game's horrid community will anger you if you decide to play alone, as it did for me. This is a game that I only recommend playing with friends. You'll find yourself lucky to find a server that isn't full of elitist morons.			"

												Some of the most fun coop experiences I've ever had were in this game. L4D2 is incredibly fun and has lots of cool mods and custom maps that will keep you playing for hours and hours. I was initially skeptical, but I soon learned that every playthrough of each campaign is always different. Even with some negative experiences, somehow I always want to come back for more. I highly recommend L4D2.			"

												I just love it. The first and most important thing - zombies!!! And, of course, killing them with all possible ways: guns, melee, molotoves, grenades...Second one: I really love all ups and downs of it, all people I met there, killing zombies with different weapons, all mutations and mods. It's an incredible experience to spend your time in this game. The same level can be boring when playing with good teammates and incredibly difficult when playing with newbies.When you have enough, it's easy to make it more exciting by finding new place to defend (you can always count on me with this :) or a mutation or add-on map.You just need to try it.Versus on the other hand... I've been avoiding it for years/hours. Started playing it with a group of friends and can't stop it now :)			"

												While L4D2 improves upon the original in many meaningful ways, it fails to recapture the same magic.While I was never one of those people who threw their arms in protest when L4D2  was announced, I was nonetheless a bit skeptical as to whether or not a fully fledged sequel, After spending time with L4D2, I can with no uncertainty say that this game is indeed a true sequel, as opposed to a glorified expansion pack. The sequel not only provides a new setting (one with more character when compared to the original), new characters, new weapons and new enemies, but entirely new gameplay mechanics. It feels fresh and new and yet at the same time, comfortingly familiar.L4D2 is an improvement over the original in almost every aspect. But it fails somewhat in one major aspect, it just doesn't feel as magical or expertly crafted as its predecessor.			"

												I don't recommend this game is because of my personal preferences. Overall, this game is fun when played online but the one thing missing about it is the feature to actually mute other players.I encounter a lot of trolls and raging players insulting each other. I've played this game for over a year on Steam.Sadly, the community ruins the game. The game is awesome but the community simply ruined my Left 4 Dead experience.I hope Valve will put the option to mute players from sending a message and voice chat in the next game or I'm not going to get it. Also, not many people are playing this game because they are no games when I search for online games (in Asia). Basically people play this game just to blow off some steam and rage at each other.

												More than 4 years after its release, this is still one of the very best (if not the best) co-operative FPS shooter, where teamwork is highly emphasized but you are also given complete freedom at doing whatever you want, although if you want to succeed easily in the missions, you will learn to enjoy and appreciate constant communication with your teammates. The concept of the game has been clearly very well thought-out and over 400 hours later, i am still drawn to play this game and it never gets old. The campaign missions are great to familiarize yourself with the maps, the settings, the gameplay, the different infected and their distinctive attacks. Everything balances itself out at every turn. But the real strength of this game is its multiplayer. You simply cannot experience the full force of Left 4 Dead, without having played its many multiplayer modes. There are so many different game possibilities and different objectives. It is one of the very few games that can keep me going for several hours, irrespective if i'm tired or sleepy - the adrenaline rush just keeps me awake and the feeling of satisfaction if you work well as a team is simply tremendous.There are also private game servers which offer even more customizable game modes. The standard versus mode for the official game is 4 vs 4. But on third-party servers, you will encounter 10 vs 10, which changes the game by enabling more chaos and way more fun. I highly recommend that you try it if you ever get tired of the official game modes and want to try something new and even more exciting.			"

												Alright, I think I'm finally due for a review...Back in 2008, Left 4 Dead caught my eye.  The idea of zombies, (How original, amirite, although It was a bit newer back then.) slicing their heads off, blowing off their legs with pipe bombs, and listening to them die to fire sounded freaking AWESOME.  So I pre-ordered it.  (I was a console peasant back then)Let's just say it ruined my life in a very, very bad *ahem* good way..By the time Left 4 Dead 2 was announced in 2009, I had already skipped school so many times continuing was probably pointless.  I hadn't seen my family more than for dinners in months and oh god was it so good. (I'm regretting it now, don't worry.)  So I pre-ordered it again.  (PEASANT.  ;_;)Well yet again I lost my life.  Left 4 Dead probably was the cause of me dropping out of school twice.  And you know, the xbox community (this is back when there were people actually playing) actually wasn't half bad, or so I thought.BOOM.  I have a computer.  Got both the games.  Didn't play 1 much, as I've already played way too much of it.  Left 4 dead 2 Scavenge mode was my absolute favorite on xbox, and now on PC even more so.  Versus I didn't want to get into, as in Left 4 Dead 1 I played way too much of it and got burnt out.  I learned so many new things and tricks that you just couldn't possibly do on a controller.  I met new friends, and with the lovely (xx hours in the last 2 weeks) tracker, I stopped playing so frickin' much.  (okay, sometimes.) The community here, even if it is filled with a bunch of cocky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, is obviously, better.  I definitely recommend this game.   If you're looking for a good zombie game to play, this one is great.  It's so simple, yet there is always room for improvement.  I doubt many people don't own it these days, as its always on frickin' sell.  If you don't have it, buy it already.Just a few tips:Learn the infected classes.  Like how the hunter needs to crouch before he can pounce in some way or another (more complicated moves are saved for later), and other stuff having to do with the infected.This game is team based.  Your teammates matter.  If your teammates are struggling, help them, unless you are absolutely better off going alone (I can only think of a few scenarios).  If your teammates can't cover you and you're 'MLG PRO B@$$' don't be all 'g3t on my l3v37 n00b', switch freaking places with them.  That's your only hope.  You don't go solo here. Same with infected.  Don't go solo.  Unless you're amazing and its a death charge, just don't.  You time your attacks accordingly, and work together to achieve the best results.Remember, all of the best teams you will ever run into in Left 4 Dead 2 certaintly know that working together is essential.  They just do it better than us.Use a mic + headphones / headset at all times.  Most people will get very annoyed if they can hear your game through your microphone, and let me tell you, trying to play a team based game with a mute person is not fun.SHOOT ALL THE THINGS.Gameplay Modes:CampaignStart by playing Campaign, either Solo or with friends.  Learn the controls up and down, & attempt to get the general rhythm of playing as a Survivor.You can either play campaign solo with single player and computer controlled teammates, or you can play Co Op.  I strongly preferred Co Op, as single player can be boring.  It is much funner to play while you joke about with your friends.  We have a few difficulties, start from Easy and work your way up.  Or, screw it all and play expert for the lulz!  I know I did that a few times with some friends, and it was hilarious.SurvivalPlay Survival for fun sometimes, its frustrating as you WILL die, but play it with your friends, and it will help you learn how to play as a team.This gamemode is generally you and three other survivors duking it out on the map of your choice, against an endless horde of zombies and special infected.  The special infected are computer controlled.You can play this alone or with teammates, but it's pointless without teammates.  This gamemode is great not only for trying to achieve an amazing time and the pure fun of that (and rage), but also because it will help improve your team working skills.  This is important.VersusWhen you feel like you understand the Infected classes and you feel comfortable playing as a team.In this game mode two teams of four go head to head.  One starts as Survivor, one as Infected.  The general goal as an infected is to kill the other team as fast as you can while working together, or if you are on the Survivor side, to make it to the end with all of your teammates alive.  Each time a section of a map ends, you replay that map as the other class.  Whichever team has the most points at the end wins.If you can, get a few friends together for a large versus game, where you won't run into a bunch of cocky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who don't remember they were new once too.  Otherwise, ♥♥♥♥ em' and just try to hold your own in a versus game.  You may get kicked, but don't let it get you down.  It's okay to make mistakes, that's how we learn, that is how we all learned.  Some people just forget that little fact.ScavengeWhen you feel like you understand the Infected classes and you feel comfortable playing as a team.This game mode is like versus.  Except you play on one map, and one map only, for a number of rounds.  The point as the Survivors is to fill the generator on the map with gas cans, and the gas cans will be spread out across the map (easily visible, so no worries there).  On the other hand, the infected are trying to stop you.  They want you to either not get all the cans, or to get them all very, very slow.You switch back and forth and the winner of each round is determined by either who gets the most cans, or if it's a tie, whichever team got them all the quickest.Ahh, the game mode that sucked me in and took my life from me.  Scavenge is really fun.  But be warned, a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s chill in this gamemode.  Brush yo' shoulder off.MutationsWhenever.Fun gamemodes that you can and should play with your friends.  You can play them alone too, though.  I haven't played them all so I don't think I can accurately portray them, but they are fun.Realism & Realism VersusRealism is campaign but on crack.  You can't see each other through walls anymore, you're basically relying on each other to stick together.  Other aspects of the gameplay are hard too, like zombies taking more damage.  Great team building gamemode.Realism Versus is basically versus with realism thrown in it ^ (read above)			"

One Word, ""Friends"" You need friends that already have this game in order for it to be a fun experience, why?

They seem to enjoy following you around when you've been humped by a jockey and running away to save someone else who is not in the danger you are. They waste medical supplies and are just downright awful. Not to mention the enemy A.I is far more programmed, putting an unfair tip of the scales when you're playing alone, and it only gets worse from that point on.-Horrid Community80% of this games community are self-centered, degrenrate, rude, racist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s most likely under the age of 12 who make it their sole goal to ensure you have a horrible time playing with them.

I've played with a lot of bad players in the past, but this game takes the cake when it comes to a horrible community.Now, this does sound bad, but seriously, this is a fun game with the right team a training, sure, not all of the community members are ♥♥♥♥♥, but sometimes you luck out and get put in a lobby woth decent players. I do like many things about this game, but the two reasons above state that I encourge you not to buy this game unless you've got buddies willing to play with you, it does add many good things being a sequel anyway.Bottom line, if you got buddie s who want to play this with you? By all mean, get it, you won't regret it			"

												This is my first fps game so I really like it. for first 1000+ hours I just played campaign then I started to get bored of this game, but then I tried to play competitive modes too which I didnt wanted to play cuz  of too much tension in these and we can't even take break for 2 mins, but once you have friends to play with its really enjoyable. It gots many other modes as mutation category and lots of custom campaigns, wow its like second Garry's mod which I stoped playing after 1 hour cuz downloads too much data and I just get stuck in loading forever... Anyway campaign is always fun for timepass, chating with friends and finding new friends.			"

												Now I really wanted to give this game a good review because it's an excellent example of Valve's work. The characters and story are very believable and weapons and gameplay are for the most part excellently balanced. On top of this there is workshop support which means endless fun and mayhem in LFD2.But unfortunately, this is heavily tainted. The only problem I have with this game is the god awful and poisonous community which inhabits it's every nook and cranny. Some people who play this game are downright mean and clearly have something wrong with them.Most of these are so called 'Pros' and veteran players who infect the game community like cancer. Newbies get no chance and no mercy when playing this. It has been proven many times. Whenever there is a sale for this game you'll see ♥♥♥♥♥ing and whining from the ♥♥♥♥sacks who have no life and sink over 2.5K hours into this game. So you bought the game with your hard earned money and want to have a go at the multiplayer modes?""♥♥♥ U FGGT NOOB GET ON MY LVL"" *Insta kick* is the reply you'll get from people when you don't do good enough at the game.So as far as i'm concerned, only buy this game if you have some trusted friends you can get on and play with or you can handle playing single player with bots only (which is good still). Or if you really must play with random people, brace yourself for the name calling, swearing and downright bigotry that is on display in the game and on the forums too.That is all.			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is possibly one of the best co-op games you can play out there. The gameplay is still fun after all these years and with the modding community still active, you can continue to play this game for a long time. Who doesn't want to be Deadpool and fighr alongside Garrus from Mass Effect, Duke Nukem and Elizabeth from Bioshock Infinite against an army of Minecraft monsters?! It's better to play with friends, because I hear the community is very toxic, so if you have friends, TELL THEM TO BUY THIS GAME AND PLAY IT WITH YOU!!!!!			"

												Left4Dead2 is Left4Dead2!One of the best, bloodiest and funniest zombie-shooters. Unlike the previous part, now you have a variety of choices how and with what you're going to kill hordes of zombies. New special infected, new weapons (melee, shotguns, sniper, rifles and grenades), new medicine and of course new characters and new game modes. Also the large workshop with new campaigns, skins, sounds and a lot of useful stuff for any taste.It is also great that there is an ability to play the campaigns from the first Left4Dead and there is a connection between the characters from both parts.If you like zombie apocalypse theme, then this is the game you must play! Grab your friends and lets kill these undead ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!10 burning tanks of 10.			"

												While Left 4 Dead 2 had a rocky start, Valve greatly improved the quality of the game after release. In almost every way L4D2 replicates it's predecessor and surpasses it at the same time.L4D2 unlike it's predecessor has maps that take place during the day. It features more special infected that require constant movement and cover. And it features melee weapons that add an entirely new dynamic to gameplay. All of these features are woven very well with the carried over elements from L4D1. The game still requires players stick together inorder to avoid being pounced by legions of undead and it keeps the frantic fast paced atmosphere. Alongside that, the game's versus mode adds a great deal of strategy to the gameplay. And lastly it's survival mode allows players to test their skills and provide a nice healthy amount of competition amongst each other.I'd go as far as to say L4D2 now is one of Valve's best attempts at multiplayer games on the Source engine. Harder, Faster, Better and Stronger in almost every way.			"

												Worth your time to complete maps with friends in co-op, worth you money when there is discount I admit that. Not worth playing too much in versus mode unless you are sadomasochist. Community in versus mode are nowhere near polite, it is true you can find some good people, but other then that, it is terrible. You do get judged by time you spent in this game, by how you play, by what you say, by your score done as Infected, by everything they can judge you, it is not 2009 anymore,   so you get your juice sucked from everything you bring in.

												If you never played the first L4D, I recommend picking up JUST L4D 2. It's a fun, fast paced zombie shooter with a twist. The game and story are well worth playing and even has replay ability due to having versus, and survival game modes. The steam workshop makes this game even better with the ability to have your characters look like people from Walking Dead, Nightmare before Christmas, Dota characters, funny sounds and even weapons and items. I found it very amusing and worth playing with some friends. Rating: 8/10			"

												This truly is one of the better zombie games i have played on the PC. What i like so much about valve games is the amount of time the valve developers spend on perfecting all the tiny details that shape the universe from their games which makes left 4 dead 2 a little special.But as nice as this game is i have a few things that worry me. Even though the game itself is a jewel worth playing in more than one way, in the various lobbies i created i keep running into people who join the team but only care for themir own needs. They don themselves as experts or pros or even both sometimes but in reality all that ever happens is that these players start rushing the maps while other players nomatter how often they have played this game don't get a proper oppertunity to get a taste of the athmosphere and as a result get isolated from the rest.In some cases you even get an immature big fat mouth from them when things don't go their way. It's a problem i have noticed eversince i started playing this game. Needless to say in time my preferance for short plays in spare time went over from co-op to using the standard bots which i really regret but is a problem i often hear from the gamers i know.With that in mind we can all jump high or low about it but it is the way it is. The best i can recommend is to play this game with good friends because let's be honest that's what you have friends for. Especially with left 4 dead 2. Wouldn't it be a big waste to let an awesome game like this be overshadowed by a bunch of underage anons who never learned what gaming is all about?			"

												Many people love L4D2, following the incredible success of L4D. Personally, I think this game is a heap of ♥♥♥♥ - and I love just about every other Valve game.Technically and graphically, it is better than L4D, and unfortunately, that's the only part it is better. In everything else, it stinks.Gone is the atmosphere, the friendly rivalry between Louis and Francis, the grainy 70's film effect (seriously, wtf were you thinking), dark brooding cityscapes, and the witty repartee between all four members.Instead, you get four unlikeable characters that spend more time whining and ♥♥♥♥♥ing at each other, bright sunny days in New Orleans, and near constant waves of zombies.In fact, that is the main thing that irks me about the sequel. In the first one, if you had a strong member of the team, there was a fair chance they could pull the the rest of the team through, which made for some hectic, but fun, gameplay.In L4D2, there is no chance of that. The waves are too relentless and the specials spawn far too frequently, so if the team is a little disorganised, you're ♥♥♥♥ed with a capital F.Once the game decides it is going to target you, that's it until you either run of medkits or the team gets tired of trying to protect you. More often that not, you're spawning back at the safehouse, because one player got boomed, jockeyed and then incapped in the spitter goo. Cue ragequitting from less invested members of the team. The fun factor just shines through at that point (/sarcasm)I've tried hard to like this game, really I have. God knows I've put enough hours into it, but I just can't bring myself to like it in any way shape or form. In fact, I've gone from trying to like it to hating it, and have completely removed it off my PC. If I could delete it from my Steam library, I would.L4D may have had it's flaws, but it certainly had atmosphere and characters you could warm to, and my final verdict is that L4D2 does not hold a candle to it.To sum it up - in the first game, you felt like you were all fighting against hordes of zombies. In the second one, it feels like you are fighting everything in the game - zombies, weather, terrain - some maps are just a slow grindingly weary slog from start to finish.It's cheap enough to pick up for a bit of fun, and you might like it, but I seriously can't recommend it when the preceding game was far FAR superior in gameplay.

												I simply can not write this review without saying one thing.Old but gold.Thats it.L4D series in general is an amazing zombie killing, non stop action endorsing first-person shooter that is still being played to this date.Now I have played a lot of both games off steam back in the day and the biggest fun factor is getting your friends and you all group up as you try to survive  the butchering hordes that are chasing you. Singleplayer aspect of the gameThe gameplay is simple to understand, reach the safe house or get absolutely slaughtered.Throughout your campaign you will meet many survivors who have fallen to the green flu.Raging from the common infected,to the special infected and up to a mini boss a tank.There are in total 6 special infected,with the 7th one being the tank and a not so commonly found witch.The campaigns are not that difficult to complete,in fact after a couple of hours you'll be rushing trough them like a bowling ball trough pins.Now thats for the singleplayer. Multiplayer aspect of the game Multiplayer is currently experiencing a bit of a bad time.Not just now but for years.And as much as I love this game and trust me I do, I cannot encourage you to get it if youre aiming to play with random people.If youre gonna play it with your friends then of course get it right away.But If you get it to play multiplayer with randoms you will be kinda disappointed.I've seen people being kicked in versus mode for the smallest things,even being kicked for having a name that someone doesnt like.Random kicks are always being voted and it seems to never stop.I love this game but some people take the multiplayer down to the drain with such acts.My final verdict for L4D2 is 8/10.If you're gonna play it with some friends,get it right away.Hell even if you wanna play with randoms get it.But keep in mind what I said.Thank you for your time.

												This is one of the best zombie games i've ever played and still playing it as of this time. The plot is nice,with different modes to choose from. Whether you wanna play this as a single player,co-op Multiplayer,vs,scavenge or survival.,this game has it all. You will not get bored playing it coz there are tons of custom maps out there that supports it. I usually play custom maps with my friends out there and we had a lot of fun playing it. Gameplay is nice,with adequate supplies and variety of guns to choose from. You also have the option to change skins and add these customizeable maps that you normally get from the workshop or gamemaps itself. My only gripe in this game is when you're already at the safe house,A.I still manages to spawn some zeds out of thin air which is kinda annoying IMO. Well,other than that if you have left 4 dead the original this is certainly a great addition to your zombie game collections out there. Will i recommend this game to a friend? Well definitely i will. It's of those top tier games of 2009 and still kicking and got lots of servers out there til now :DGo and grab your copy now :D10/10 Cheers XD			"

The game has loads of different weapons to choose from and also has the original campaigns from L4D1. In versus mode you can play as a survivor or the undead. The undead have different classes such as smokers tongue ability to hold the victim, spitters venom that damages the survivors and hunters pounce which pins down the survivor.

 Best Ways to Get Rid of Zombies  Anti-zombie arsenalGuns. Of course. Whenever you see a zombie movie, guns are the weapon of choice. And I use the term “guns” loosely. From a 9mm to a harpoon to a grenade launcher to a slingshot loaded with cherry bombs, guns can be a fun and effective way to get rid of zombies. Use them for target practice, set up sharp-shooting contests, or engage in zombie hunting escapades. It’s a fun outdoor activity for the whole family!Shovel. It’s good for digging, but more importantly, it’s good for whacking zombies. It can also be used for beheading. Y’know, removing the head and destroying the brain? Other than zombie whacking, shovels can be used for zombie poking, zombie prodding, zombie battering, and zombie dismemberment. You can find them in most garages, they fit into the back of any old pickup, and you can even use that shovel in your garden after the crash of civilization. Amazon has a fine selection, like this Ames True Temper beauty.Ax. For those preferring a more hands-on eradication of zombies, consider the ax. Exercise those upper body muscles and get a good cardio workout with each swing and hack. Use your ax to remove the head or destroy the brain. Or simply immobilize the zombie threat by removing its limbs. Use the ax to cut down trees to create a fence for a zombie fight ring. Invite your friends. Think of the entertainment value! Best Ways to Get Rid of ZombiesRemove the head or destroy the brain to get rid of zombies. This is the most basic principle of destroying the ravaging zombie horde. It relies on the assumption that the infected zombie brain sends brain-eating messages to the zombie body. Sever this connection between zombified brain and undead body and you are left with the simply dead instead of the undead. Without the motor skills or motivation to devour brains, the zombie becomes indistinguishable from any old corpse lying around. Use whatever means you have at hand. Then consider composting the remains for your garden. Though soylent zombie is not recommended as it may spread the zombie virus. And taste terrible.Chainsaws can get rid of zombies. If it’s good enough for Bruce Campbell as Ash in Evil Dead, it’s good enough for you! Perhaps this most classic method of zombie destruction and removal is what’s best for you. This will not only remove the head or destroy the brain, but can also disembowel, de-limb, quarter, massacre, destruct, and generally discombobulate zombies. Two drawbacks with this method include the splatter zone and the chainsaw wielder’s close proximity to zombie teeth. This method is best used on slower moving zombies with poor motor skills. And don’t forget to take along your raincoat.A tiger pit can help you get rid of zombies. This is an oldie but a goodie. Using the shovel from your anti-zombie arsenal, dig a deep pit. Think grave-deep, at least. Then, using your anti-zombie ax, fashion some grotesque wooden spikes out of some local trees or remnants of old wood picket fences. Securely embed the spikes at the bottom of the pit. Cover the hole with a sheet or tarp or any other pliable surface. Cover that surface with leaves. Consider using a decoy, such as an irritating in-law for bait, and you have yourself a genuine pit of doom for any wandering zombies.Get rid of zombies using a wood chipper. If perhaps your zombie type is of the slow-moving and easily tricked variety, a wood chipper is an excellent way to remove yourself of these unwanted zombies. Consider a type of tiger-pit strategy with perhaps a human or another zombie as bait. Using a wood chipper will not only remove the head or destroy the brain of zombies with unadulterated gusto, zombie chunks may yet prove a useful source of natural fertilizer, or even a natural biofuel. Just don’t forget your safety goggles.Wait for the zombies to decay. This method relies heavily on the type of zombie infestation that you have. This will not work on every kind of the undead. But it may be that the type of zombie around your neighborhood doesn’t have a very long shelf-life. If your zombies are the type that cannot regenerate or repair their own tissue, then hot-dang, all you have to do is wait it out! Exposure to the elements will wreak havoc upon undead tissue. And as they begin to decay, their ability to acquire brains from human beings also decays. Soon these ferocious brain seekers will only be piles of goo, and your life can once again return to normal. Things to avoidFire. While fire may seem to be a natural, cheap, and easy solution to your zombie infestation, I assure you that fire is most likely not the answer. You know how those zombies are, always getting into everything. Curious little creatures they are. Now, can you picture those curious little biters on fire?Nuclear arms. Nukes. Good for killin’ the whales. Bad for killin’ the zombies. Imagine a bunch of brain-crazy, undead cannibals hell bent on eating you. Now imagine that they’re radioactive to boot. You get where I’m going with this. So, unless you’re into killing whales, avoid the nukes. "

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a cooperative first-person shooter and the sequel to Left 4 Dead.The sequel picks up one week after the events of the first game where The Infection has spread to the southern United States. Left 4 Dead 2 introduces new weapons, melee weapons and new items. There is a new cast of human Survivors, which include: Coach, a portly high-school football coach with a bad knee; Nick, a rude and cynical gambler and con artist;Rochelle, a low-level production assistant reporting on the evacuation for a local television station; and Ellis, a friendly mechanic.The game also introduces three new Special Infected: The Charger, The Spitter and The Jockey.Left 4 Dead 2 currently has thirteen campaigns playable in all gameplay modes, six of which are from the original Left 4 Dead. The game has 4 different game modes: Campaign, Versus, Survival and Scavenge.During Campaign, also known as Co-op, up to four players work together to try to reach the end of the campaign by fighting their way past large numbers of AI-controlled Infected. There are four difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, Advanced and Expert.Versus is the basic competitive mode for the Left 4 Dead series: two separate teams of four players take turns playing as the Survivors and the Infected competing for the most points.The point of Survival Mode is to hold out for the longest time, with times being saved and virtual medals being awarded for surviving for certain amounts of time.Scavenge is a competitive gameplay mode in Left 4 Dead 2. It is a round based game in which Survivors have a limited amount of time to find up to 21 gas cans to fuel up a generator (or car), while fighting against player-controlled Special Infected much like in a Versus game.As in the first game, each scenario is presented like a movie. At the start of the game there is a movie poster showing the cast. At the end the ""credits"" display the statistics for the game, like who killed the most zombies, who inflicted the most headshots and so on. The final credit shows how many zombies were killed in the making of the film and also the film is dedicated to the memory of those survivors who did not make it to safety.Every aspect of Left 4 Dead has been refined and tweaked to perfection. It has brilliant graphics and a nice cinematic feel. The new campaigns and unique game modes offer more variety and more longevity, while all the other additions and tweaks make the already great gameplay even more enjoyable. Even the AI has improved a little bit, and while they still aren't big on using pipe bombs or Molotovs and are prone to missteps, they seem to have a better grasp of tactics and will follow you a bit more closely. Still, Left 4 Dead 2 is best enjoyed with friends.It is an addictive and atmospheric game and it is in my opinion one of the best co-op games ever made.Sounds 9/10Graphics 9/10Gameplay 10/10Atmosphere 9/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												I actually became a nervous wreck by playing this game too much, the clenching of my butt cheeks passing every corner, waiting... Waiting for that charger, that boomer, that smoker, that spitter, that jockey, that hunter.  However nothing compares to the horrors of feeling about 50 pounds of un-earthed cement flying through the air towards your party, feeling the tremors of the ground as you know. God isn't real, there is only the Tank between you and salvation now, Pray he have mercy on your soul.			"

												I'd say L4D2 is within top 3 cooperative non-grind survival game you can enjoy without ever getting bored or find yourself with no variety of maps & modes to play. No matter casual or hardcore player a multitude of gamers can enjoy this experience in any playstyle they wish. Valve also gives a lesson to MANY horde survival / objective games in how you execute a near perfect difficulty system.[✔]> one of few the games that reward you for teamwork> big amount of official game modes > mod support (maps, guns, sounds & models)> very fluid gameplay> melee & guns variety> strong visuals for it's time> relevant difficulty slider[✘]> need friends to enjoy it> VS playerbase will kick you for every ""mistake""> jockey has bigger hitbox than it looks like			"

												Merhaba arkadaşlar, oyun eski bir oyun olmasına rağmen eğlenceli bir oyundur Kafa dengi 4 veya 8 arkadaşınızla beraber eğlenceli dakikalar geçirebileceğiniz bir oyun türü. Oyunda belirlenen senaryoları bitirme olarak amaçlayan bu oyun oldukça güzel. Vuruş hissi güzel oynanabilirlik gerçekçilik hissi biraz zayıf. Oyunda VS mod mevcut 4 vs 4 olarak zombiler ve insanlar olarak hayatta kalma yarışı yapabiliyorsunuz. Belirli periyodlar ile ilerlerken silahlar itemler bulunuyor. Oyunda mermi sıkıntısı yok belkide güzel tarafı budur Kısaca bu tür oyunları seviyorsanız ve hala DayZ almadıysanız kesinlikle DayZ almalısınız.

The only thing you have to look for is the tools to kick-♥♥♥. From how the characters have funny conversations with each other and have a cameo of the few first survivors.

												Before posting this review, it thought: ""hey, let's have a look to the negative comments to see wha- wait. What the hell is this?""People complain about it having bad graphics, crashing when starting, not being suited to be classified to survival, or horror, etc, etc. I mean, seriously.First of all, Left 4 Dead is an awesome game about TEAMWORK. Yes, teamwork. I see people complaining about being kicked from versus. Playtime: 1-2 hours. What do you expect when you don't know how to play properly? I'm not saying I'm a pro, but it's been blood and sweat to become decent at this game, running it on a crappy notebook, at 10-15 fps on hordes. You can do better than complaining on reviews. You could actually play the game. Learn how to share first-aids, pills, adrenalines, use defibs, when to use stuff. That's only learned by playing campaings, watching gameplays and so on.Secondly, before buying a game, the best you can do is find a torrent and download it; watch gameplays on YouTube, read critics on the internet, and then try it on your own. If you like it, buy it. If you don't like it, don't. If you got it free, then don't complain unless it's useful. There are lots of ways to try a game before buying it. Lastly, people complain about online players being rude and mostly rage quitters. This is not completely true. However, I do agree that the community is not as warming and welcoming as it used to be. This is because the amount of players playing it has increased considerably, leading to people who cannot handle losing, people who consider themselves gods of L4D2, etc. Is this only their fault, though? I highly doubt it. People who complain about others mistreating them, usually tend to hide the fact that it might also be their fault. It's not hard to say ""could anyone help me, I'm new on this game"". It's not hard to make friends on this game. I have made lots of them playing versus, and my friends too. It's about the attitude towards how you behave against others.L4D2 is a great game. Enjoyable. A bit repetitive. But what game isn't after playing it for 80+ hours. Tell me RPGs are not about killing monsters over and over again, or others FPS are about killing guys, looting stuff, etc. Think before posting a review. Is it your game crashing? There are forums where you can post your problem. Is it that you didn't like it because of unknown reasons? Give good reasons stating the facts that make it bad. But most important, change your attitude towards the game, and online players. I'm not speaking only for newcomers, but also for those so-called pros who mistreat newcomers on versus.			"

												Before the original Left 4 Dead came out, I wasn't a big fan of zombies. My spouse bought me the original game and wanted us to play together. I was hooked. I'm a sucker for a good storyline, and the L4D series delivers. The second game centers on a new set of characters. While I wish the group was more balanced along gender lines, it is nice to see POC represented.I have become obsessed with playing zombie games ever since I started playing this series. Now my entire family has their own copies so we can all blast zombies together.			"

!!!BIG FAT WARNING FOR NEWBIES: THIS IS THE MULTIPLAYER GAME AND COMMUNITY IS USUALLY ONE BIG PIECE OF TOXIC SH#T THERE!!!!!!YOU MAY GET ANGRY, SAD AND DEPRESSED INSTEAD OF BEING ENJOYED OR CHILLED AFTER THE MULTIPLAYER GAMEPLAY!!!!!!THEY USUALLY DO NOT WANNA HELP NOOBS NOR EXPERIENCED PLAYERS!!!!!!THEY STALK, INSULT, THREAT, PUBLICLY WISH DEATH, DOWNVOTE AND SPAM!!!!!!FORUM IS TOO OFTEN FULL OF TROLLS, DANGEROUS RUDE ID#OTS AND TROLL-FISHES!!!Pros: The game itself is not so bad and there is a workshop and authoring toolkit. And this is the fastest *glitched* votekicking and insulting simulator I ever saw.And a game joke:- Why headshoots don't work in L4D2?- Because no one L4D2 user has any brain.TL;DR:PUBLIC MULTIPLAYER: TROLLS&ID#OTS, RAGEQUITS, GLITCHERS, THEY TEAMKILL YOU *RIGHT BEFORE* CAMPAIGN ENDS, THEY KICK&BLAME YOU FOR EVERYTHING: LOOSING, LESS HOURS, WINNING(!). HIT/MISS IS A GLITCHABLE PING/LERP-RELATED S##T. QUICKPLAY OFTEN JOINS PAY-TO-WIN/CHEAT/R#PE SERVERS. SINGLE-PLAYER IS BORING AFTER FIRST FINISHED EXPERT! 7+Y.O. GRAPHICS! CAM IS ALWAYS INSIDE SOMEONE!In my opinion you should AVOID Left 4 Dead 2(1) unless it's cost equals to ZERO, because this is the exact amount of joy the public multiplayer will give you!You WILL feel like an overdue sh#t! Check health insurance before buying that game! CatMario is less frustrating than public multi- there!Community says you should NEVER join multiplayer versus modes (versus/realism versus/scavenge) without thousands hours of experience... but you can get good experience as SI ONLY BY PLAYING MULTIPLAYER VERSUS MODES... So this is the classic dead end.This game is 7 years old. You will meet members with 7 years of experience. Many of them simply started to stink or went crazy...My ex-friend offered me L4D1 for free as a legal Steam gift. I refused. I did not wanted to join another community horror.Best part is when 3 players got incapped and you are the only who can help them. You are going to help them, but there is a hunter chasing you, so you fight him first. And you killed him and start running to help them... And THIS is the moment when you will be usually votekicked for not giving an IMPOSSIBLE INSTANT help for 3 d#mb and thankless id##ts... But when you ignore the hunter, try to instantly help them and get catched by hunter, you will be kicked too...Even when you have hundreds/thousands hours of experience and have been playing a long and enjoyable scavenge match with friends in public game, then often 1 or 2 id#ots join your team and start votekicking or TKing you. Public games are the f-g cancer there.You can start your own localhost server and this can protect you somewhat against kicks. But you need a really good Internet connection. Public IP is recommended. Many people leave localhost or sometimes try to DDoS/hack your PC.Summing up, multiplayer community contains:- trolls who will team-kill you and rage;- newbies who rage after the first tiny failure;- toxic pros who will votekick you after the first tiny failure... even if it was their failure...;- toxic id#ots who will kick you for not being a wizard and slave (well... if you are a wizard and slave, you are kicked anyway);- id##ts who will votekick or kill you right before the campaign ends;- enhanced lame-pros on official servers who do wall-hack, bbox-glitch, grab & throw 14455 cans per second and are uncatchable by special infecteds (no, those players will NOT be VAC-banned, they will kick you);- id##ts who join public games and slash all the joy of users playing there just because;- fake-females, catfishes, phishers, game vulnerability exploiters and slowhacking game servers;- strange person who can remember you and DDoS every game server you join for the next year (all players are disconnected during DDoS);- at least one id##t from my country who yells ""kick f-g noobs!"" via mic and kicks EVERYONE!You may be kicked for:- being dead before others;- when someone other was killed before you;- doing everything right while votekicker has no idea why you did what you did;- not helping a person;- helping a person;- going left for 12.4 seconds instead of 12 seconds;- not being a wizard and slave;- not using the mic;- using the mic;- not having >5000 hours of gameplay;- having ping >80ms;- not catching uncatchable player;- not using key binds or scripts;- when they wanna friend instead of you right now;- when votekicker is an id#ot.During sales some trolls set up scavenge servers with unplayable maps for noobs (scavenge with invisible walls, only waste of time).Some toxic ""pros"" join PUBLIC in 2 and kick EVERY other player. Saw it many times.Hit/miss IS ping related.And the VERY BAD thing is that Valve did IMHO a GOOD JOB and made the game WELL with reasonable multiplayer tools. And I am REALLY SAD to make a negative review. I even got the game for free during the event, so I should be happy... Maybe I should be happy, but after 1000+ hours I am unable to recommend this game to newbies... It was my only multiplayer game so I was retrying very often, but on any versus it is usually one big piece of mental horror...Valve even added achievements for people who help newbies, but the community never changes...After 1k hours I wanted to maximize my EXPERT achievements AND I DID IT... by playing SINGLE-PLAYER ALONE WITH THOSE ""BAD"" BOTS... because multiplayer users usually raged, TKed, votekicked or went crazy before the campaign ended (or even started)... and I did this alone successfully without any ill stress, even if it was 4 times harder to complete the map (no rescue closets, bots do NOT carry fuel cans). No cheats/hacks. Some retires needed, but it was doable and enjoyable after finishing!On the contrary, I bought OTHER AAA game and started Team Deadmatch multiplayer after only 15 minutes of experience (including the time of messing with GFX settings). And... no one blamed others for being a noob with rank 1 (they had ranks like 25, 60), no one raged, no one votekicked... And we even won. And it was joyful. I believe something like that is impossible with L4D2.So if you really wanna try L4D2, there are my pro-tips:DO PLAY versus and scavenge after some SOLO (single-player) play. Do NOT stick with solo play - it is the dead end.1. Find someone on public games who is weak (or has little hours) and is NOT a troll/i####t.2. Friend him. 3. Play with him in friends-only game.Repeat 1-3 to make bigger team.When you are voted without a valid reason and without any explanation, then block person who started the votekick.You are welcome.And if you like TR2013 for it's CASUAL/RANKED selector, L4D2 doesn't have it...Read about console commands that improve your security against exploits.Apply security commands BEFORE joining any multiplayer games.If you believe that experienced community help newbies, visit community forum and think again! Can't post links, but did some quotes:Originally posted by JewSlappa:I was kicked. For no reason.At all.I don't know what I did to deserve this...Originally posted by Vietcong Charlie (NVA):I would kick you just for giggles.
In fact, I would probably make several alt accounts just kick you for more giggles.Originally posted by Acevy:The community for this game is probably worse than anything else I've ever playedOriginally posted by jari86:Don't like it or the community - get the f##k outta here. ... Eat sh#t and die.Originally posted by Richard:I joined and got kicked a second after.

												A timeless co-op experience; full of varying types of zombies, weapons and  characters. This game is made by valve so performance issues are practically non-existant, apart from the occasional crash, the optimisation is great.The introduction of the workshop  allows you to play community made maps along with with modifications to the base game, for example: you could turn a gnome into killer keemstar,  KILLER ♥♥♥♥ING KEEMSTAR  or maybe you want to turn your tank into shrek, the sky is the limit. With varying amounts of game modes too, this game has plenty of bang for your buck regardless of if it is on sale or not.If you haven't already got this game, do yourself a favour and click that purchase button.

												Sequel to the award winning first. Teamwork is absolute key to survival. Replayability is off the charts. Characters are memorable and identifiable to a level of wanting to meet them.Whether you like shooting zombies or just staring at teammates making your character laugh at them for 10 minutes straight, you'll love the game.

												Amazing game. A true example of innovation done right in gaming.-Graphics: crisp, clean textues and environments. 720p and up.-Frame Rate: 60fps and up.-Sound: Audio is breathtaking, clear, and optimized.-Gameplay: Incredible. A simple system that's easy for first time players to learn, yet complex to offer late game masters something to calculate with. Balanced enemies, spawn rates, weapons, movements, HP system, and ammo capacity. Can be as challenging, easy, or unforgiving as you want. Well tailored to any and all players.-Level design: Environments are diverse and uniquely pathed to offer a different feel and strategy per level. Spawns and item placements are mostly randomized, yet still manages to make use of every corner of the maps. Direction and pace of play is linear, but never gets old or burdensome.-Multiplayer: Fast connections, great server support, one button in game press to check your signal strength. Local, dedicated, and undedicated server support.-Customization: Near everything can be modded to suit anything you can think up. Textures, sounds, maps, Ai, objectives, text.			"

												This game isn't brand new anymore and as such it must be said that the graphics aren't the reason anyone should buy this game. If you're looking for a game that's amazing to look at so that you can take tacky screenshots to post on your hideous profile then this isn't the right choice. If you want a game with exciting and extremely diverse gameplay, with game modes that offer a whole plethora of experiences and cater to many different tastes then this is the game to buy. Great value for money, A real classic that will keep you entertained for a long time if you manage to discover the particular game mode that suits you best. The game is also supported by a (once) strong modding community that has created an extensive collection of mods and additional content such as maps and minigames for you to enjoy. Must be said that the community within certain sections of the game is one of the most toxic, unfriendly and devoid of skill that you will find anywhere. Don't expect a warm greeting in versus mode if you're new to the game and have little experience and skill. You will be kicked again and again; My advice is that you should play campaign until you have a solid grasp of how the game works before playing versus or your experience might not be very enjoyable.

												One of the most entertaining zombie apocolypse games out there, it will keep you happy for hours on end. All the characters are well developed and well sustained even within such an intense atmosphere and the game mechanics work like a charm, Valve never ceases to dissapoint me.

												So, it's time to write something about Left 4 Dead 2, I guess.Yes. Yes, I know this review comes late, but who cares, huh?Left 4 Dead 2 was one of the first games I bought on Steam and still remains one of my favourites because of it's diversity and the fun you can have when playing with friends. It's a First-Person-Survival-Shooter where you have to fight your way through various maps and chapters, whilest semi-brutally slaughtering tons and tons of zombies.If you plan to buy this game, make sure your friends do own it too, otherwise you will only have half as much fun as possible.Now on to the game design:The overall design gets a 8/10 from me.The weapons are well rounded, have a game-fitting visual design and are fun to play.The zombies are great. Normal zombies aren't a great threat, if they do not appear in big hordes, like you would expect it. The special infected are tougher, but not impossible to beat and it just overall feels great to fight them.The map design is also fitting for a post-apocalyptic world, it's all in a more grey-ish style and seems rotten and abondoned.The game mechanics:Survival-Slaughter. It's as simple as that. Find basic weapons at the beginning, progress through the linear chapters and fight, fight, fight. I personally would've enjoyed it even more, if the game would've let more opportunities for alternative ways open, or the ways would've been harder to find, but it was okay and I guess I spent more time hindering my friends than actually fighting.The best part about the game is the mod- and Steam-Workshop-support, you can make a completely different game. Your zombies can be Stormtroopers, Aliens or you could even let out your hate of bronies on them! You can add different sounds, weapon skins, maps, character models, everything you can imagine to mod can be modded.So - All-in-all:Gameplay: 8/10Design: 8/10Diversity: 9/10Fun-Factor: 9/10A great game and definately worth checking out. Have fun slaughtering with your friends!			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a nice zombie-shooter/survival game with - contrary to most other zombieshooters - actually has swift action and therewith a tense and interesting playstyle. For instance, the zombies in this game can run, which eliminates the main reason for other zombie games to be rather static and dull. Comes with a variety of playmodes and maps for every different skill level, from rookie to tryhard. The main problem with this game is its community; especially when playing the Versus mode, unskilled teammates are very often frowned upon. Teamwork IS essential in this game and therefore one bad or really slow player (or troll) can offset an entire match, but in my opinion, the votekick option is overused, as well as verbal raging on newcomers or people that do not play on a regular basis. Competitiveness and 'playing for fun' is unbalanced, as most Versus games you'll play are either against a premade group of 4 pros, against a group of random newcomers, a group of ragequitters OR a combination of those: the middle level for the average, mediocre player seems to have faded away and close games are almost impossible to get, unless you have 2 pro teams against each other.Pros:- Fun gameplay with tense action that requires full concentration- Well thought out characters with good voice acting- Has a good variety of game modes that keep the game interesting for a long time- Sound effects and music add to the 'scary' or 'horror' factor of the game in a very positive way- Has the right mixture between gore effects and unrealisticly exaggerated images that make it attractive to the gore-lovers, but not too scary for younger kids to playCons:- Overly competitive community; not really the place for the individual gamer, the newcomer or the casual player (unless you play with friends, in that case its still great)- Despite having several game modes, everything is played on a limited amount of maps (although I have to say, there's plenty of addons available to make up for this, and it will still manage to keep your interest for quite a long time)- When playing on Single Player, the AI have a lot of bugs that can result in unnecessary deaths (like getting stuck in a certain routine or prioritising the saviour of another AI that is incapacitated MILES AWAY) which can get REALLY frustrating if it happens in repetition.Overall its a good game and I'd most certainly recommend it to those who like to play casually with their friends, or competitive on a high level.Rating: 7.5/10			"

												This updated review is directed to those considering buying this game at the time of a sale.If you have not checked my profile, you will see that I have more than 4,800 hours at the time of this review.  There is a good reason for that, I can tell you this game is fun for anyone who wants to shoot zombies/infected.  Unlike other zombie games, You get to actually play as the infected against player-controlled survivors and vice versa.  It is even more fun when playing with friends in against an equally-skilled opposing team. This game features and abundance of assorted games modes and mutations (which are sames modes but with varied tweaks) perfect for just about anyone.  If you are new, go to forums and find some new players such as yourself and add them as your friend.  Play with those friends in the campaign mode to learn the game and its infected.  Practice playing as the infected in Versus Survival mutation mode.BEWARE,  IF YOU JUMP straight into the Versus/Scavenge competitive modes before actually earning experience in a lot of campaign games, you will be met with a somewhat unwelcoming community that will vote kick you.  As with any game, you have to learn the basics before trying to go into the competitive (Versus/Scavenge) modes.  There is a good reason for this (despite the community having a bad reptuation), a infected team will exploit any weakness the other team has: be it a new player with inexperience, a slow-progressing person, or player with incomplete understanding about the game mechanics.  It is the fact that player infected can think tactically and combine their attacks whereas bot-controlled infected in campaign will go attack one-by-one but not all the time.As a new player, the vote kicking feature will seem like your worst enemy and will even turn you off and disregard this game (A lot of silly forum threads because of these reasons).  But after awhile, you will learn that this feature is necessary as it removes AFKs, Griefers (Teamkillers/glitchers), and inexperienced players (sadly).  Remember that there is no rank system in place and therefore you will be placed with veteran players easily in Versus.  Getting dominated quickly is no fun nor is it fun for your teammates.  Strangers in versus will rant on you for single mistake (which is wrong) but one mistake on infected can mean 400 easy points to the opposing survivor team.  Likewise one mistake can mean your entire survivor team falls and unable to aquire points. In campaign you can retry to complete the map but in Versus YOU DON'T.It would be great if you brought over experience from the xbox version of this game. BUT!! keep in mind, the standards of playing ARE MUCH higher here than on xbox.  I played xbox for the longest time before coming to pc, and I noticed one thing.  Survivors can aim a lot better than their xbox equilivents. So in xbox, the infected have the upper hand and are able to do damage even if attacking alone.  But in this PC version, attacking alone as infected will get you killed easily (you will be lucky to get close to a group bunched together).  Xbox only tranfers over: map layouts, item usage, and gameplay mechanics.Unlike Resident Evil games, you will have to work with your teammates to succeed here.  Remember this is a co-operative game, you are playing as normal survivor and NOT some superhuman charater like in Resident Evil or Dead Rising games.  You cannot LONE WOLF it in Competitive modes, (theres a mutation game mode for those kinds of players) As time passed, the game introduced the Workshop. This allows you to customized your game to whatever you want.  Add some mods, character skins, custom music, visuals, whatever. It changes the look of the game to what you want but only you will see it though.  Example: you can change the survivors to anime characters or change the infected look, etc.Finally, remember this game requires communication so I suggest you get a HEADSET or microphone but it is not really neccessary.  Play with friends and take time to learn the game.  Remember your version of ''Fun'' may not be the same as the your teammates so you can't just play the competitive modes and expect your team accept your shortcomings unless they are on your friends list.IGN Quote : ""Ultimately, enjoyment derived from this game depends on you are playing with and how you are playing."".....""this is very social minded game that really plays of human nature...""

												Atrocious community. Ive met several pretty cool people, but Ive also met hundreds of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.The versus mode is the most popular online mode, and its fun, when you can get a balanced game going. This is almost impossible to accomplish, however. Im not sure how many versus games Ive played... maybe 100? Out of those, 2... TWO have been balanced games. Both those times my team lost point wise, but we all won because everyone had lots of fun. The remaining 98 have been total routes for one side the entire match. Even on the winning side, its just not very fun.Also, happen to not play with absolute perfection? You get vote kicked, despite you probably doing better than the other 3 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s your with.Happen TO play with absolute perfection, at least relative to your teammates? You get vote kicked anyway, because the 3 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s want ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ #4 to join their game and your holding up the spot.From what I gather the community has deteriorated over time. I wish I had gotten this when it was new. Unfortunately I didnt even know it had come out.Gameplay wise, the game could use some tweaking. There are several blatantly unbalanced ""quirks"" this game has, that detract from an otherwise balanced experienced. But overall its well done and fun to play.The game alone is enjoyably designed for the most part. Unfortunately this being a co-op centered game, the community brings down the games final rating by several notchs, since the community is integral to this games experience.Possibly recommended when on sale just to give it a try.

												Most addicting game I've played and mods still somehow keep it sorta fresh. I'd recommend new players play on normal for a while and when that's too easy, advanced, then expert. The worst thing about this game is some of the community and a couple bugs left in the game. You're basically guranateed to be kicked for not being a pro in VS, and the tank (basically a randomly spawning boss) can sometimes throw rocks through things... You will sometimes find bad players, but usually not. About 20% of the community really is horrible, but I think every multiplayer game is like that.If you like co-op games, I think you're gonna love this :)  If you don't play co-op much, be prepared to take care of your team as well as yourself. Don't be selfish with meds.Great game, okay community. Game - 9/10. Community - 7/10Wrote and deleted about 4 reviews for this, and this is likely the final because I'm not angry about the bs from people.			"

You also have cool characters and alot of campaigns to play, plus alot of ways/modes to play which are all very fun! (campaign, survival, versus, etc..). Playing this game alone or with friends in COOP is amazing and it's really a great zombies FPS, easy to play, and with very correct graphics.

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a fast pace first person shooter. Swarm full of zombies and a variety of 8 special infected to kill or play with. Each survivor has their own personality & lingo to them that will keep you entertained throughout the game when taking down the zombies. I see this title an inspiration to games that shows its not all about the graphics but the potiental that many cant conflict on. When i mean by the potiental is the gameplay its self, its always going to be a challenge to master, no matter how long you play it. It has many features to offer from weapons, to game modes for certain players with different taste E.g (Campaign/Realism/VS/Survival/Mutation)I have all do respect to the co-devlopers Valve for bringing out as much features for the Left 4 Dead community such as: L4D1 Campaigns, new DLC such as the Passing, Sacrfice & Cold stream for free. Workshop amendments for users that would like to create and download mods from authors content. Thats just to show that its not all about the money in the gaming industry but the respect valve has for the gamers. So I thank you valve for what you have offered.   I would reccomend this game to the players that enjoy frantic and non-stop action shooters. After reading this review i hope you make the right decision on purchasing the game.			"

												Short Review: This game is a highly overrated and generic zombie game that, in my eyes, is one of Valve's only failures. Not only does the game itself suck, the community is also quite awful. Go spend your money on some indie games or something.Long Review: Left 4 Dead 2. Although the critics and players rave about this game being one of the best zombie games on the market, it really isn't. Sure, there's lots of different areas to fight through, but they are all just retextured copies of the others. Get weapons, kill zombies, press E, kill zombies, get different weapons, kill zombies, kill more zombies, press E. That is how most of the levels work. There are also the levels where you collect x, bring to y, and hold E. Get weapons, kill zombies, pick up object, run past zombies, hold E. Rinse and repeat until you've beaten the level. Now that we've discussed the single player problems, let's move on to the multiplayer. The community sucks and expects you to know what each weapon is, what it does, and how to use it effectively as well as knowing each level like the back of your hand. You will be kicked if you don't have either 100 hours of play time or are quite skilled in everything I just listed. The game modes where you can play as the infected aren't fun either. The infected are difficult to use and are at a disadvantage when compared to the survivors. The only good thing about this game is the great integration of the Steam Workshop. You can download different music, new weapons textures, new levels, and more. In other words, buy this game if you want to be disappointed. Rating: 4.5/10			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a great game that exceeds expectations in the FPS, horror, survival/action genres. The game offers a great amount of fun with the various Valve campaigns, including custom maps in the Workshops, and other modes such as Survival, Mutation, and Versus. Despite the game being released a while ago, the community of gamers that enjoys this game is still growing and strong. Coop is very fun, but can be a pain if you have a horrible team or trolls (be careful with playing on public games/servers). The different levels of difficulty can make or break your experience --- and playing with others encourages you to be helpful and patient. Overall, Left 4 Dead 2 is a greatly enjoyable game with a variety of features, modes, and campaigns. I highly recommend this game to people who enjoy killing zombies, FPS games, or horror/survival/action games.			"

												If you don't have this game already, and like First Person Shooters... get it. It's sometimes on sale for only a few dollars, and on occasion has even been free for a weekend or Christmas.The best co-op game I've ever played, hands down. I spent nearly a thousand hours playing campaign mode before even dipping a toe into Versus or Scavenge game modes. These (competitive) multiplayer modes are very fun also, but be aware that you will be expected to have mastered the learning curve BEFORE jumping into these - your teammates will expect you to know the game already, and there's virtually no on-the-job training, so to speak. ;)L4D2 includes pretty much all the content of L4D1, and a bunch more besides - 4 new survivors, 3 new Special Infected, 5 new campaigns, new ""uncommon infected"" specific to these new campaigns, and new player-usable items in every category. Plus an add-on workshop to customize your game when it finally starts feeling stale. In terms of play hours per dollar spent, no other game I have EVER played comes close.So if you're wondering whether to get this game? Get it, especially if you can get it on sale. Even if you only play it a bit and put it aside for other things, you'll probably be glad you have it in your library to play with friends occasionally.			"

												My review for Left 4 Dead 2- I can say that this game, is one of the famous pioneer of zombie co-op game. While this is the sequel, but this game complete its predecessor.- Really fun to play with friends.- Can be modded. Definitely good feature here.- The enemies not really that frightening because first, the way they behave are funny, second, you got 3 more friends (or AI) have your back. Be careful though, don't let them swarm your team.- Not only normal zombies, but also unique special zombies with different abilities, and also uncommon normal zombies that have unique traits on them.- Different game mode to play. There's versus mode who can make you the special zombies, and have purpose to prevent the survivor from saving themselves. There's also more game mode like scavenger, survival, realism. You can even add more with mods.- A lot of choices of weapons. Additional melee weapons that makes this game better than its predecessor.8.7/10			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 - a computer game, a cooperative first-person shooter with elements of survival horror, developed and published by Valve Corporation. The game is a sequel to Left 4 Dead. Pros:  1. Joint survival.  L4D - is the cooperative shooter, in which the emphasis is on the passage of a joint venture with real players, not bots. So enjoy all the gameplay chips in the form of excellent team work, it can only be together with other players.  2. Battle PVP.  In a multiplayer game is fully revealed the potential and the idea of the game.Talent Team infected heap, someone knows how to pour the survivors of vomiting, while others choke the language, well, someone just ♥♥♥♥ing shoot. All the fun in this lies. Under the bot can already tune, but under real players net.Oni can cheat, to negotiate, to use cunning tactics to create unusual ambushes and act outside the box.  3. The atmosphere and realism.  Valve is well tried, the graphics in the game match for her elegant atmosphere. The dark and empty streets, ruined houses, abandoned hospitals and airports, it all looks very good. Immediately evident that the developers have worked all the details.  Minuses:  1. Bored. Maybe if you get bored a lot of play in it.  Conclusion: Left 4 Dead 2 is a game that became for me a great way to forget about your problems and relieve stress by killing zombies. "

												This game is honestly a classic and deserves to be in every single persons steam library. Whether it be because of the teamwork based gameplay, the extensive (and i mean, holy ♥♥♥♥ huge) mod list for this game, or the generally pretty helpful community, this game does it all. I purchased it on sale when it was only 5 dollars but it is easily worth buying even at the price it is at now. The first game i was in was a survival mode somewhat like Call of Duty Zombies except with no in between round wait time, some pretty chill dudes were explaining to the lobby how to get into a glitch that lets you survive longer (yes it is an old game, there are LOTS of glitches). They were helpful and definitely not rude, although i am sure as i play this longer i will run into a few rude people. Ive read reviews and they made me hesitant to purchase, some saying the community is toxic and will kick you for even a small mistake and stuff like that. Anyway, im sure someone will start b1tching, ""you only have a few hours you havent even played it yet"" and yeah, theyre right. On pc i barely have time logged into this game. This game was also on xbox 360, which i played extensively for hours on end. Same game, just a different platform. Anyway, it is a pretty cool game and thanks to the huuuuuge mod catalog, this game has near infinite playability. Sure, it might not be for everyone but i think this is a game most people would definitely enjoy. Buy it and give it a shot! Also, add me if youre down to play it cause itd be cool to have a few friends to play with. Its a game that requires a lot of teamwork and communication, especially on the higher difficulty levels.

												Damn it, no, I can't. Even if I would want, I can't recommend L4D2 over L4D1. I'm gonna skip the community thing as often players are behaving like bunch of idiots even outside of game (vide forums etc.) so I think it doesn't worth any commentary as it won't save this game.Despite having more hours played in sequel, when I bought L4D1 I felt like I'm playing completely different game. In my opinion it's the L4D1 which looks like finished product, more polished, way less glitched and annoying with its gameplay mechanics. Everytime I turn on L4D2 I see idiotic Survivors animations, ugly flying pistols and unbellevable amount of melee weapons and SMGs, like game wanting to say „C'mon, don't pretend to be a hero, just take that axe and run like idiot – I'm gonna kill you anyway during next Crescendo Event if you won't drop your pistols”. I don't say L4D1 is easier – maybe sometimes it is, but I feel that thinking ain't necessary (and even welcome) in L4D2.Someone may say that I'm another L4D1 addict being mad at Valve because of L4D2 and porting older campaigns, but no, I can't be like that since I actually bought L4D1 after buying L4D2 (yes, I was that dumb) and while I feel L4D1 was worth my money, I think I wasted $$$ on L4D2. But I am mad at Valve as I think L4D2 is step back. And the saddest thing is that people moved anyway to then new and fresh game which is now practically as old as L4D1 which I prefer.			"

												Great apocalyptic zombie game. You can try to survive with your friends, fending off tons of enemies. It provides a lot of fun, worth to try it in my opinion ;D   My rating is [ 7.75/10 ]   ""Pills, pills. Where are my pills ? "" - Louis			"

												The son of Left 4 Dead ( L4D1 ) , Left 4 Dead 2 has a lot of more features including melee weapons , more detailed textures, Dynamic weather effects by A.I Director 2.0, New special infected ( Charge , Spitter , Jockey ) , Bile Jar item pickup, Incendiary or Explosive rounds pickup, etc.Playing L4D2 never made me feel bored , no matter how long this game has been released.This is the one of few games on Steam that still got people to play even after a few years of it's release , without any major updates.However, even though there was fixes on bot's smart level, They sometimes have trouble on saving a player from Smoker.P.S , some recent Addons relating to Nexon's Counter-Strike Online and Sexy Survivor mods simply boasts up the fun.

												If you're looking for a 1 sentence review, Even if this game was $100 or even $150 I would buy it, totally worth it.Without a doubt, the ABSOLUTE BEST coop (& zombie based) game I have ever played, & probably ever will play (probably until L4D3).I compare ALL other coop games to this game.I just keep coming back to L4D2 no matter what, even after years, I just love this game so much! Can't get enough of it.  I can't remember even a second where I wasn't bored with L4D2. This game is like my salvation, always there for me whenever I get bored, always ready to be awesome & fun.And you know the best part? Even if there was only the 5 basic maps, I would still play this game for years on end, it's just that much FUN.  (the game comes with more than 5 campaigns; 5 L4D2 original campaigns, 5 L4D campaigns, 2 cross-over campaigns & 1 Community campaign that was made Official due to it being super awesome)This game in phenominal in the way that you don't mind playing the same campaigns over & over again, every time it's a different experience.  And then of course there's the campaigns in the Workshop, that add so much more to the game & show cool new features too!If you want a game where you can play with friends, shoot zombies, have sht tons of fun, & with a little bit of tactics & smart play mixed in, this is the game you've been waiting for!

												Oh I need to write a review. Just 5 more minutes... I'll be back.Okay, so... I really enjoyed it. If you're looking for guaranteed fun, this game is what you need. You're basically a group of 4 people trying to survive a zombie apocalypse, but it's not just zombies: there are also some special infected that will leave you for dead. You can also turn the tables by playing as the infected in the Versus mode, which is even more fun. Amazing game. Now if you'll excuse me, I need one more minute...			"

												Left 4 Dead perfected the co-op shooter, this expanded on it. The idea of team based-cooperation is thoroughly explored through realism modes that remove crucial aids such as outlines through walls, melee adds depth to the concept of corner camping, and anti-camping enemies make every area a peril.Twice as big as Left 4 Dead, even more when you bring in custom campaigns, the game ensures that the core concepts are given more than their fair share of replayability.Recommended custom campaigns from the Valve-run Left 4 Dead blog, for your convenience!http://media.steampowered.com/apps/l4d2/maps/bloodtracks.vpkhttp://media.steampowered.com/apps/l4d2/maps/ihatemountains2.vpkhttp://media.steampowered.com/apps/l4d2/maps/2evileyes.vpkhttp://media.steampowered.com/apps/l4d2/maps/hauntedforest_v3.vpkhttp://media.steampowered.com/apps/l4d2/maps/detourahead.vpkhttp://media.steampowered.com/apps/l4d2/maps/city17l4d2.vpkhttp://media.steampowered.com/apps/l4d2/maps/suicideblitz2.vpkhttp://media.steampowered.com/apps/l4d2/maps/deathcraft-ii.vpkhttp://media.steampowered.com/apps/l4d2/maps/warcelona.vpkhttp://www.l4dmaps.com/details.php?file=7387 "

												This game is a pure gem.Want coop? Want versus pvp? Want it to be more realistic (realism)? Want custom/addon content/maps (workshop+downloadable add maps)? Want lots diverse playmodes without sacrificing playability?Even if you don't want all that, there's nothing else that beats the mandatory teamplay, incremental ongoing learning ladder and all the diverse experiences that awaits in this game.Just get it (buy it), even if it's not for sale. Try everything, because all the different playmodes are that good (well thought out, designed and implemented)! Really!This is a game you can both play casually AND play over entire weekends. Just be sure to stretch your legs in between games. This is a game where it's relatively easy to find, create and join online games, and doesn't break the flow during a game unlike many other multiplayer online games.Be warned though: Start on the easier levels first (normal+). You'll learn more and learn enough to be helpful to games at Expert level later. If you get kicked, it's probably because you missed something and annoyed someone. Later, you may become friends with the more experienced players and appreciate the game even more deeply.			"

												Interested in Zombie killing?  Looking to survive the apocalypse?  This first person shooter game maybe the key to all mankind.  The great thing about this game is the versatility as well as the variety of zombie attacks.  You can go from story line by yourself to with your friends or even with strangers.  There are various levels such as easy, normal, advanced and campaign.  But that's not all.  There are more game modes that will keep you interested!  Fight in multiplayer cooperative games such as survival to see how long you can last.  Best part about it, you never win... you always die!  Go more into depth with the game and become infected with your teammates and attack the other teams in versus or savenge.  What did you say? The game is too easy?  Try it out in realism.  This game mode does not give you help like glowing ammo or items.  They don't even tell you where your friends are.  Like in real life, you have to find where they are for yourself!With Mutations, you have a set of rules or variations of the game you play by... so if you are looking for a harder version of survival... Nightmare may be your answer... Want to shoot all zombies with a M60? No problem! Gibs fest will grant that.All these are fun and dandy, but the game wouldn't be the game that it is without 3rd party server hosts, dedicated and casual players as well as contributors to the steamworkshop where you can add more maps, skins and textures to your game by subscribing to the item so you have the newest updates for those items as well!. :)We long for a LFD3, but as the game continuously grow with players and mods from the workshop things can get quite... Interesting.			"

												One of the best co-op games out there.Left 4 Dead 2 uses a simple ""zombie"" theme with brand new characters, areas, and new special infected introduced. The graphics have imporved from the first game and the gore have been redesign so it is even more satisfying to shoot the zombies with hell of a lot more blood. There are also new special infected to make the maps more challanging. The new characters are really well designed and their dialogs are hilarous so the player interaction can be extreamly satisfactory if one finds a nice team to play with. This game is a remastered, improved Left 4 Dead. Some of the old game modes remain untoched, however Valve has added new ones like: Scavange, Mutations, and realism versus modes.This game is an imporved Left 4 Dead 1 game. 90/100Note: Don't buy left 4 dead 1 if you own left 4 dead 2. All the maps are included in Left 4 Dead 2.			"

												Left 4 Dead 2 is the Fps of choice to the gore hounds and the zombies lovers. The game itsef is not much like classic zombies where survival is the top priority, instead its more of a first person shooter, where landing your shots and have sharp senses will many times decide your fate. Getting infected is not a thing as the survivors in this game cannot turn. Zombies are so weak and so fragile, they there simply to slow you down. The real game is between the survivors and the special infected, mutated zombies variants, that use they multiple habilities to kill the survivors, and as they are the only ones that can be controled by humans, its a game of teamwork where the best team wins, in a 4vs4 versus game action. Now the worse part, the commnuity, you will always seem to find yourself stuck in the same situation, in a game with 3 other people in campaign where one of them starts to shoot everyone and leave, or in a versus game where your team joins and leaves, changing faster than you can keep up, while the other team is alwasy the same 4 people, just spamming, bringing up excuses evertime ur attack is sucessfull, and scream at you full force and CAPS LOCK with no regrets every swear word in the english dictionary everytime you survive they combined attack. You will be invited to a lot of Get owned groups and You suck, your mother will get insulted a lot in every language you can possibly imagine, and your teammates leaving you faster than rats in a sinking ship, but if, and only if, you luck out and find yourself great friends, you will enjoy this game for all its worth it.8/10 The best zombie game to play with friends, the worst game to play alone.

												Love the multiplayer. Singleplayer is a bit difficult due to the terrible AI (who can't even throw molotovs, bile, or pipe bombs), but it is also fun when playing on a lower difficulty. But if you do get this game, get it for the multiplayer. Versus is tons of fun with friends, and I can say the same for the multiplayer campaign modes.  Everynow and then a mutation comes out, and with it, a lot of new fun as you adapt your playstyle to it. The gametypes are all unique, and if you value a good multiplayer experience, I would go and pick this game up.			"

Of course, there are different modes ranging from Easy to Expert.

												First I thought this would just be another one of those zombie games, but then I realized that there is a lot more to it. There are not just zambees but a huge variety of them like, smokers, those monkey zombies, and these chargers who run right into you and have way too much health. This game is fun and I recommend it. This has to be one of my favorite Co op games. The second reason that makes this game so special is that this game requires a lot of teamwork. If someone has low health and they don't have a med kit, you should heal them. Or when people are about to fall from a ledge help them up and when people are lying on the ground, you should try to revive them. The more people you have, the quicker you get the job done. The only negatives to this game is L4D community. If you are AFK for a little bit, they kick you. Another example is that if you're trying to save yourself but this other person is being attacked and is low on health, they hate you for not helping them out. I've had an instance where a guy had to leave and then a new person replaced him. The other player in the game was being whiny and really wanted to kick him because he want the other player back. One of the biggest things that ♥♥♥♥ the hell out of me are the players in scavenge. They kick you almost all of the time if you are not helping the team. This is a few of the reasons why I hate Valve. But this rarely bothers me or anyone if you are good at this game. 8/10 And oh god is the Witch creepy!			"

												The impression from 1st L4D was much stronger then from 2nd. 1st was gently scary and it was something new and exciting. 2nd version is an amplification of the first one, its features didn't excel the 1st part. The addition of few new common and special infected, melee weapons and guns and maps was not enough.For example, in movies Terminator 2 excelled Terminator 1. Aliens 2 excelled Alien. Half-life 2 excelled Half-life. But L4D2 didn't excel L4D. Don't like the idea with AI director that fills maps with wondering zombies. Makes all maps similar to each other, there is no difference when playing on one map or another except the layout and environment. Didn't like how the game becomes a chaos with thousands of sounds playing at the same time, when lots of zombies attack you, it becomes annoying. I just turn sound off at such moments. Daytime maps were interesting to try but it turns out that it's not so scary and not so cool as it was in first l4d.Despite these drawbacks, the game is very well made. Greatly optimized for slow PCs. Has nice maps and textures and sounds. Interesting SFX. Modding support. I'm not a zombie fan, but those who like zombie stuff will certainly love this game. I can recommend this game for everyone to try. But as for me I didn't like it.			"

												This is one of the best multiplayer, and possibly the best co-op experience I've had. I get to kill mounds upon mounds of zombies while teamed with my friends or stranger-teammates, and watch the blood fly on a memorable (enough) assortment of maps, all of this while getting to check out some very cool and not-very-experience-changing—but in a good way—mods. The AI also is well-built. Zombies act like they should, and the odd AI teammate can still be useful OR fun to kill! Especially when I'm not lagging, it's always fun to blow away and make a 'realistically violent' movie (if you know what I mean)! *10 burning zombies!* "

												There’s nothing more frustrating than having to depend on a loved one not to do something awful. In normal games you just have to believe in their skill, but Left 4 Dead 2 changes all of that with The Witch. She won’t hurt you if you don’t bother her. You could just walk past her, wave a bit, and be on your way. That is, assuming your friend isn’t a backstabbing pile of filth.You’re playing over Steam (obviously) and chatting like old drinking buddies when your friend suddenly goes quiet. ""No,"" you plead with yourself as you hear the strained breathing of someone about to pull off a devious prank. Your friend's character slowly turns--it’s probably Coach--and raises his gun. The world is quiet. Then in one split second he fires at The Witch and your whole team is dead. The quiet returns, this time accompanied by your once-friend’s crazed laughter. They got you! Man what a jib. Yeah, screw you dude. I'm leaving you to die when I find the chopper.			"

												For Valve, Left 4 Dead 2 addresses a curiously brisk turnaround time considering the postponements and discharge date pad all around connected with its amusements, astoundingly in the years making prepared to Group Stronghold 2 the still concealed status of Half-Life 2: Scene 3. Despite that history and the potential concerns connected with how soon this stimulation is appearing after the guideline, Left 4 Dead 2 is especially a total redirection, on a very basic level more so than the in any case, and is probably on the planet the better thing. In the occasion that you're still in the disposition to amass up with amigos and murder packs of vivacious undead, then it doesn't allude to change than this. Regardless, if you're exhausted on Left 4 Dead's gameplay condition, the continuation, in an indistinct class from it is, may not be sufficient to warrant a buy. It's a preoccupation that is more about refinement and augmentation of existing parts as opposed to offering something inside and out new. As requirements be, after you've played Left 4 Dead 2, it's hard to pull back to the first without a fragile assumption disillusionment. Keep in mind, of Left 4 Dead's four extraordinary battles, just two were set up for Versus play right out of the entry. It wasn't until Valve discharged the Survival Pack months at some point later that players got the full Versus encounter and in addition the now-standard masterminded Survival mode. Left 4 Dead 2 has five full and all the all the additionally enamoring effort, a more fleshed out and particular setting with some magnificent development set pieces, more identity, more modes, and if all else fails gives you more to do. From different viewpoints, I wish this would have been the thing that was discharged first since it feels essentially more full-included than the to begin with, and the irately amass engineered style of gameplay wouldn't have been as run of the mill then as it is at present. It's totally conceivable you're some person who never played the first and don't comprehend what I'm discussing, so I'll wander back for a minute. It's the zombie end of the world, and you play as one of four human Survivors who attempt to shoot their way through swarms of lively moving ""degraded"" (which I'll infer as zombies) to get to the end of a guide. The continuation is set in the American southeast and the new cast of characters is more vital this time around, as they have every one of the reserves of being more mindful of their condition, prattling never-endingly and remarking on particular parts of the earth as they fight through. Ellis' incompetent stories while grouped in safe houses are a specific highlight as he waxes on about gawky accomplices while swarms of unsafe zombies fixate on his position, and a little while later the others ordinarily show him to close his mouth. That is not what you ought to do while playing, regardless. More viably than most novel titles out there, Left 4 Dead 2 obliges you to fill in as a social affair in the event that you need to win. You have to talk, and you have to take an interest. Each individual from your four man squad of Survivors should go on about what they're doing, getting out areas for ammo, weapon, and thriving pickups, and requesting help when in a dreadful position. The catch is that no stage ever plays out practically identical path, in light of the route that there's an automated thinking called the Chief addressing the activity. Packs of conventional zombies can strike at whatever point, and if what the Chief flings at you demonstrates pointlessly troublesome, your technique for improvement through a phase may even get swapped around to make things less asking. It makes each experience arranged, and engages repeat play as it changes with test players of any capacity level. Like some time starting late, there are assorted bother settings, with Ordinary serving as a normal range level test while on Master just those with the best correspondence, crucial organization, and response aptitudes will survive. Left 4 Dead 2's Authenticity mode makes the test altogether all the all the all the more overwhelming, evacuating obliging sparkles around things and weapons despite various things, which means it's all up to your social abilities to get out ammo and thing pickups or to tell individuals you're stuck in a ghastly condition. In case you're the kind of player who things being what they are shies far from a talk and likes to stay tranquil, then you're not going to like Left 4 Dead, for the most part in light of the way that you're social occasion isn't going to do enormously well if everybody's lone interfacing on an unessential level. By prudence of what amount facilitated exertion is required in Left 4 Dead, it's besides one of the best preoccupations out there for setting off a lively reaction in players, which works both ways. In the event that you understand how to pull through, you feel a significantly more unmistakable slant achievement, and in case you're losing, it can be especially jumbling since your prosperity is generally as subject to the direct of people around you as it is in isolation particular limit. Bots are still included, nevertheless, so in the event that you might need to encountered the five battles with no other individual that is all around conceivable, and ought to a man need to drop out almost through a crusade, a fake mental fitness will expect control so you don't need to all surrender. Your PC controlled partners will work close to, making definite shots, swapping out weapons, resuscitating, exchanging things and modifying when essential. It's no place close as associating with an issue, however it's still sensible and playable solo. In a perfect world, similar to when get readied for a correctional facility keep running in a MMO, you'll can get a full amassing to handle the difficulties, and it's an endeavor that is doing what should be done when in a full Versus redirection. Despite whether Left 4 Dead 2 is for you truly relies on upon your level of presentation and getting a charge out of for the style of in-your-face total centered gameplay Valve is progressing here. If regardless you're required with the gameplay, then you're going to esteem all aspects of the continuation since it's enhanced in all areas, from open distraction modes to nature of character and identity to replayability and its visual style. In the wake of playing, you'll see it difficult to do a reversal to the essential redirection. Despite the way that different excitements offer co-authority gameplay against swarms of PC controlled enemies, no other distraction stresses coordinated effort as positively as this, and couple of different preoccupations are as fulfilling when you're set up to pull through enough, especially when doing combating in Versus mode against four human-controlled chief zombies. In the event that you saw the first and were persistently inquisitive to give it a shot, then by all techniques get the kill. It is, unmistakably, the better pleasure. In any case despite the noteworthy number of developments and extensions, it's still especially comprehended, and something proposed to interface with the general population who are beginning now sold on the idea. In the occasion that you're some individual never dealt with the distraction, Left 4 Dead 2 isn't going to change your supposition. Taking everything in account, it stays a champion among the most unmistakable co-pro titles out there, and considers likely the most nerve-blasting social event assemble multiplayer gaming in light of the market.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

												Ever wondered its time to join the 'zombpocalypse'? Left 4 Dead 2 is the best place for you. Four survivors with an arsenal of weapon ranging from chainsaw to M60 and lots and lots of Infected trying to hunt you down. L4D2 picks up where the first game left off, only with new survivors to hunt and be hunted. The short story of the game is spread through 5 chapters (although it was expanded with DLC campaigns). It is not overtly complicated and deep, but it can be suspected for a game of this nature and fairly this is not the most important part of this game. On normal settings the campaign can be completed around 4 hours or so, if you have access to the DLC campaigns it will extend the fun to 6-7 hours. Amping up the difficulty will increase the challenge and frustration originating from the retries you have to take to complete the chapters. While the story is not the richest out there, the game features some amazing voice over and writing. The characters are funny, witty and believable -- in the world of the game of course.When you (if you at all) breeze through the campaign with bots this is when the real fun begins. Online multiplayer is its name. Simply, this game is meant to be played with other humans. First of all, the AI is not horrible, bud it is bad enough that you will be constantly ripping out your hair while playing the game SP (especially on harder difficulties) Not to mention the Infected AI is much better. Second, the shooting is at its best when you are surrounded with real humans trying to help you survive or chasing you as Infected. Yes, there are game modes (Versus, Scavange, etc.) where you can show your skills as a Spitter, Charger or any type of Special Infected.The challenges will just never end with this game. You can play different MP modes like Versus or the newly introduced Scavange (collecting cans and filling up the generator while the Infected are trying to stop you). Or if you want you can just play the campaigns again with human help. If you are tired you can jump on community servers or try the endless number of easy-to-use mods created for the game by the community.Here we are again. Valve have proved again that they are indeed the masters of Multiplayer Madness. After hits like Counter Strike, Team Fortress we have the upcoming wave of games like the L4D2 series and DotA 2. While the SP mode is not much engaging and falls short of expectations and you may not care about the characters in the end, if you ever want to just jump in and oppose the endless hordes of zombies while having super fun, this is the ultimate and most definite place to start.Rating: 85/100; Replay Value: 5/5; To Beat: 6 hours (SP - with the campaign DLCs); Played on: normal.

												MINIMALISTIC REVIEWPros:- Fast-paced gameplay- Variety of weapons, attachments and bullet customization (eg; fire bullets, frag bullets, etc.).- UI and HUD is simple and understandable.- Story is well-organized and well-relayed (if the players do put attention on the story)- Melee weapons are introduced.- L4D game is combined to this game with a bonus top-rated community map featured on the game.- Variety of zombies and also the special common infected (eg; riot zombie, hazmat zombie).- Epic and challenging map and level designs.- Tutorials are user-friendly.- Features a band that KINDA existed (Midnight Riders!!!! WHOOO!!)- Music blends perfectly on the environment.- New systems have been added to the game that were not available on L4D (eg; witch's critical hit, etc.)- Characters are great and accomodated to the post-apocalyptic scenario.- No DLCs. Just pure fun.- Mods are welcomed (have your own style of the apocalypse).- YOU CAN BE THE INFECTED! Now that is fun.- Can be played with potato PCs.Cons:- Item physics are wobbling and act like light plastic (most especially the gas cans).- AI Survivors were designed to just shoot and pick up items (ammunitions to be specific). They are not designed to interact with certain objects given by the map.- Some weapons that are available at the game files are not accessible in the game (eg; AWP).RATING: 9/10 would shoot alarmed cars again.

												Left 4 Dead 2. This video game has brought me an adventurous experience.Gameplay: The gameplay is enjoyable. The different game modes are wonderful. The weapons are well-balanced. The zombies are used wisely. In certain situations where you raise an alarm or attempt to escape a specific area, the zombies will run fast and this immerses players in an actual zombie apocalypse. The Special Infected are amazing. Their special abilities can cause players to feel frustrated. However, this motivates players to work together to defeat them. The ability to add mods to the gameplay is absolutely outstanding. You can change your style of play.Setting: The story is well written. It is set in a zombie apocalypse. The characters in the story have a decent backstory although they could have been provided with more character development. With abandoned buildings and highways filled with cars, the maps are designed nicely. Thoughts: The video game feels short and repetitive. More maps and challenges could have been added to the story. After the finale of Dead Center, it would be fun if players could drive the car. A challenge where the players can rescue other isolated survivors could have been used as well. This develops the interaction between the survivors.Verdict: This video game is simply fantastic and worth the money. If you are a fan of zombie apocalypses, this video game is the one for you. Playing the video game by yourself is fun but it is better to play it with friends.			"

												Este juego no es como la paja, que al menos divierte jugar solo. Está pensado para jugar con amigos/amigos de amigos o randoms si es que te gusta tratar con completos desconocidos. El tema es que, como todo juego MP de Valve, la community en general es un asco, llena de parásitos que se creen ""pr0"", cuando la realidad es que tienen 5000 horas porque son pobres y un día se les dio la mágica la posibilidad de comprar este juego por, como mucho, 5U$s. Obviamente todo esto previo jugar otras 5000 horas en servers No-Steam, llena de comandos pelotudos y mensajes cuando entrás, seguramente algunos subliminales de corte peronista.El único modo que vale la pena, en mi opinión, es el versus (4vs4), donde está el plus de la competencia. El modo campaña es una ♥♥♥♥♥♥ que consiste en ir de un punto a otro para terminar en un auto/blindado/barco/avión/heli/armario. Y los otros dos están porque había que poner algo, uno es el genérico survival y el otro es simplemente una cagada que ni recuerdo como se llama.Es agradable si te encontrás un grupito de gente copada para jugarlo cada tanto, ya que usualmente te tienen que bancar por más que seas un reverendo hijo de ♥♥♥♥, debido a que casi siempre falta gente y no da jugar con un slot libre porque los bots son como simios con autismo y entonces se desbalancea todo.Si no encontrás al menos 7 entes vivientes o 3 si te gusta la ♥♥♥♥♥♥, recomiendo tener amor propio y jugar a otra cosa, y si sos pobre y no tenés otro juego jugá al TF2 que es F2P y volvete más mogólico pero con la posibilidad de tradear y dejar de serlo.

Somebody in the mic on my team set up a plan and told me to stand around a corner and wait until I see the survivors walk by. As soon as they did, I charged 2 of them right into a lake and the match went down-hill from there.But really, the game is fun and great for people who want to fight waves of the un-dead and the special infected zombies with friends.

												7 years after this game was released - is it still worth playing?The answer is a resounding... YES!There are some experiences in life that can tell you more about yourself. L4D2 has been one of those experiences.From the outside, this is just a zombie game (BRAAAAIINSSS!) with hilarious characters and overpowered weapons.But it is so much more. It teaches you the value of sticking together as a team, of putting others ahead of yourself, of facing your fears, efficiently using your available resources and pacing yourself to the finish.It invites you to become a more skilled shooter, a more patient gamer and empathize with your teammates for your own good.Timing is another key to victory - whether that be the timing of your attacks as an infected or the timing of your m2 against one.A note about the online L4D2 community:Yes, there are lots of people who take this game very seriously and hate losing/ love winning. As a new player, if you end up playing with some of these people, you are likely to get kicked out of the server. This is unfortunate, but it's true.To these 'pros', I say that sometimes it is wise to put yourself in the shoes of the new players - after all, we were all noobs once. You might win a game by kicking someone, but if you decide to teach them instead, you might help the community gain a new capable player for many more fun games.That said, I've met many wonderful people in this community. Almost all my Steam friends have come from L4D2, and for good reason.TL;DR:In this game, you will dread some moments, you will laugh out loud, you will feel accomplished in victory and disappointment in defeat. This is a ride that never ends.*THE BEST $5 I HAVE EVER SPENT FOR MYSELF AND PROBABLY EVER WILL. EVEN THOUGH THE GAME IS QUITE OLD, IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT TRYING IT OUT, STOP THINKING AND GET IT.

												Left 4 Dead 2 forces you to work as a team (if you want to win). You need to talk, and you need to participate. Every member of your four person squad of Survivors needs to be communicating about what they're doing, calling out locations for ammunition, weapon, and health pickups, and asking for help when in trouble. The catch is that no stage ever plays out the same way, because there's an artificial intelligence called the Director governing the action. Packs of common zombies can attack at any time, and if what the Director throws at you proves too challenging, your path of progression through a stage may even get swapped around to make things easier. It makes every experience different, and encourages repeat play as it adapts to challenge players of any skill level. The only reason I see for anyone NOT to purchase the game is if you don't like playing online. However, if you don't mind being social and have gaming friends, then you have no excuse.			"

												This is a game that has done nothing but improve from its predecessor as a sequel in almost every way. The new weapons and game modes are astonishing. There is literally no purpose in going back to the first game, as nearly everything that was there is present here in a better way, with many additions. However while the game is superior, it is still not one that makes me want to come back a lot on my own. It's a game that I recommend one to get only if he/she has friends to play it with, as that is how you'll enjoy the game to the max. Single player will get dull and repetitive after a while, and even multiplayer can be monotonous. The teammate A.I. still hasn't improved, often times they'll just stand there while you're being smashed by a charger or getting cut by a hunter. Despite this, if you get on this game with the sole desire of slaying zombies with your friends, or killing your friends as zombies or survivors on the entertaining versus mode, it can be very fun. Great job, Valve. 7.5/10.0 "

												Left 4 dead 2 is one of the most interactive co-op game I've ever played. This game will appeal to others who are looking for competitive, fun, and intense gameplay. Feel the wrath of hundred and hundred of zombies launching themselves at your throats. Don't stop for one sec for a Smoker to bind you with it's tongue. Don't stay in a open spot for a Hunter to claw you to death. Don't seperate from your teammates, you'll find yourself at the mercy of an Jockey. Zombies aren't your only enemies, watch your feet for acid that burns like no others from the mouth of an Spitter. Zombies are not noticing you? Then bathe in the bile of a Boomer to show a horde of zombies how good you looked......to eat. Narrow areas are the Charger's favorite spot to squash you into pancakes. She may be crying, but once the Witch is startled, you're in for a world of hurt, hope you have health insurance. Rarely appears, the Tank is the boss of zombies. He's one badass that will put your lights out.			"

												Este juego no es como la paja, que al menos divierte jugar solo. Está pensado para jugar con amigos/amigos de amigos o randoms si es que te gusta tratar con completos desconocidos. El tema es que, como todo juego MP de Valve, la community en general es un asco, llena de parásitos que se creen ""pr0"", cuando la realidad es que tienen 5000 horas porque son pobres y un día se les dio la mágica la posibilidad de comprar este juego por, como mucho, 5U$s. Obviamente todo esto previo jugar otras 5000 horas en servers No-Steam, llena de comandos pelotudos y mensajes cuando entrás, seguramente algunos subliminales de corte peronista.El único modo que vale la pena, en mi opinión, es el versus (4vs4), donde está el plus de la competencia. El modo campaña es una ♥♥♥♥♥♥ que consiste en ir de un punto a otro para terminar en un auto/blindado/barco/avión/heli/armario. Y los otros dos están porque había que poner algo, uno es el genérico survival y el otro es simplemente una cagada que ni recuerdo como se llama.Es agradable si te encontrás un grupito de gente copada para jugarlo cada tanto, ya que usualmente te tienen que bancar por más que seas un reverendo hijo de ♥♥♥♥, debido a que casi siempre falta gente y no da jugar con un slot libre porque los bots son como simios con autismo y entonces se desbalancea todo.Si no encontrás al menos 7 entes vivientes o 3 si te gusta la ♥♥♥♥♥♥, recomiendo tener amor propio y jugar a otra cosa, y si sos pobre y no tenés otro juego jugá al TF2 que es F2P y volvete más mogólico pero con la posibilidad de tradear y dejar de serlo.

Left 4 Dead 2 is the single game that brought zombies mainstream and allowed hundreds of games to be developed in this genre. Its fast fun FPS action with an whole host of amazing community made mods. Shoot away hundreds of zombies and fight to stay alive for as long as you can. Many game modes to choose from so replay is very high here. A Source engine game that must be in your collection. Played best with 3 friends!			"

Graphics and soundtrack are great and fitting as well and the whole weapon system (1 big + 1 small or melee one can be carried, plus bombs, whereas the variety is not huge, but big enough) and ability to share medkits amongst the team add more realism to it.Many gaming modes are included too, aside from the standard campaign one, making the game a complete immersive experience.Teamwork is everything in this game if you want to survive, so it is also a good chance to meet new people!

												This is one of those classic must own games on steam.The game premise revolves around being able to choose between four characters - and a certain gun set such as machine guns and shotguns. Multiple zombie hoards come attacking you wave after wave and can stop suddenly. Which sets this game apart from other zombie games is there is certain zombie types in this game. One guy as a tongue that stretches out and grabs people, another guy is a big fat blob who goes around puking on people and attracting zombies to them (and when he dies he blows up)! The game is set up as FPS with the player having the ability to heal themselves (while being not able to shoot) or heal their partner.

												Left 4 Dead 2 is a game where four survivors attempt to survive and escape the zombie horde.If they survive or not, is up to you, and how you play.Left 4 Dead 2 manages to be fast-paced in a genre of slow zombie survivals, but it also still manages to retain the tense and stressful nature of the rest of the zombie games. There is no aim down sights in the game, unless you are using a sniper rifle, similar to the rest of Valve's games. Another thing in line with the rest of Valve's work is the lack of regenerating health. In Left 4 Dead 2, players must use first aid kits in order to heal themselves, with adrenaline shots and painkillers acting as 'temporary' health. Much of your survival depends on how well you utilize your first-aid...Do you save it in case something goes wrong, do you use it on someone else, or do you use it like it's the last chance you'll ever get...? Will you ever find more down the road? These are the questions you'll quickly ask yourself and the rest of your party as you try to make it through.Other than the healing items, there are various other items to keep an eye out for as well. Pipe bombs, molotovs, and even a jar of bile. Pipe bombs draw standard zombies to them with a loud beeping sound and a bright red light. In Left 4 Dead, loud sounds will attract zombies, and the pipe bomb in particular will keep them away from you, and will eventually kill them when it explodes. The molotov is a simple but effective weapon in keeping the horde away, it puts down a field of fire and it burns enemies. The last item is the bile jar. It attracts the horde to anything you throw it at, and they'll stay on it for a while, killing whatever it happens to land on. Even other zombies.The jar is filled with the insides of a boomer, one of the special infected of the game. The special infected of Left 4 Dead 2 are zombies with unique abilities that will prove deadly to survivors, and will require cooperation or a skilled shot to take down. Perhaps both..The Boomer is a large zombie that vomits on survivors. This attracts the horde of generic zombies to attack them. However, if the survivors are not careful in dispatching the boomer, it will explode on death and splatter on the survivors, turning a situation from bad to worse.The Hunter is a fast and agile zombie with a normal body frame, making it slightly harder to distinguish than other special infected when running. However, when it gets into a crouching position, it pounces on survivors and claws them until they die. It can pounce from very high locations to do extra damage, or it can ambush survivors from unexpected places. The Hunter wears a hoodie, and growls when getting ready to attack, screaming loudly when pouncing.The Smoker is a tall zombie that coughs a lot. That's why you don't smoke, because then you'll get lungs like this guy.Anyways, the smoker has long reach, allowing it to pull survivors around, and into dangerous positions. Smokers will try to pull you into a car alarm to draw the horde to you, or they will try to pull you to another special infected so they can try to pick off another survivor, or maybe they'll just pull a survivor off a ledge, either getting them stuck holding it for their life, or forcing the victim to run all the way back to their group.The Tank is a large, massive, and powerful zombie that can kill the entire group if left unchecked. They have huge muscles, which makes them an easy target, but it also represents their strength. One punch from a tank, and you'll fly several feet away from the rest of the survivors, and, on high difficulties, it could even end you in one hit. They can even toss rubble at the survivors, giving them a range option, as well as already being lethal in close quarters.The Jockey is a small zombie, he runs fairly quickly and jumps on survivors, 'riding' them away into danger.The Spitter is a taller type of special infected that spits acid onto survivors, being an effective long range unit that can deny an area to the survivors, or flush them out. Spitters also drop a pool of acid when they die, making them a bit more dangerous to deal with, especially when you are being pressured by a large amount of zombies.The Charger is a large zombie that literally charges survivors. They run at the survivors with full speed and once they pick up a target, they continue running for a while, or until they hit something. This makes them very dangerous in situations where they can thrust you off of a dangerous height, or if there's deep water, because they can sacrifice themselves and take you with them.Now, we've covered all of the special infected, and there's also uncommon infected as well, but I won't go over them here in order to save some space, and they aren't too important anyways.The gunplay in Left 4 Dead 2 is very easy to get used to. From assault rifles, shotguns, pistols, melee weapons, snipers, and even grenade launchers, players should find it simple to point and shoot at zombies. Headshots are obviously more rewarding, as it will kill them zombie faster, and you'll save some ammo too. There are different deployable ammo types as well, which have different properties. High explosive, for example, will explode!In Left 4 Dead 2, there are events in the game where you have to do something very loud in order to progress, but they draw a LOT of attention. These are called 'Crescendo Events'. These actions cause a massive attack from the infected, and require the survivors to defend themselves until the action is completed. Some events are gauntlet styled, which require survivors to run, rather than wait. Zombies will keep spawning in these gauntlet styled events, so it's best to move quickly. Also, at the jukebox, there's a song that plays and it says 'All we wanna do is eat your brains', which will also spawn enemies.When a survivor dies, you can rescue them in closets through the game, or revive them with a defibrillator. However, you can rescue them before that and revive them when they are down. Going down too often without using first aid will result in death, which can be noted when the screen turns grey. Some game modes disable spawning, so it may be suited for super serious players.At the end of every campaign, there is a final chapter, a finale.In the end, survivors hold out until rescue arrives, and this is the last stand for the campaign.Whoever dies here, is dead at the end, and at least one survivor must escape.Being prepared is extremely important here, as it will require determination from all survivors.Occasionally, the finale will also require the survivors run through another 'gauntlet' styled attack, except the finales are far more dangerous than the standard events, featuring more enemies and lots of special infected.I recommend getting the game for CO-OP, it's great at what it does, which is being a great CO-OP experience.For the single players, I honestly have trouble with recommending this game because there simply isn't enough to justify getting it just to play with the AI. The AI is extremely dumb, and they have HORRIBLE reaction times, occasionally letting you take massive amounts of damage before they save you, and not bothering to shoot the special infected, but instead they try to melee them when they are on you, making them waste valuable seconds needed to save your life. There's also not really a real story, other than backstories about the survivors and backstories about the other stuff around you. While some people have grown into the characters of L4D, I personally have not cared about any one of them enough to feel connected with the game itself. The soundtrack is also not really worth mentioning, in my opinion. It has a nice attempt at trying to place a dark feeling, but it's simply average at best. Gameplay also becomes monotonous without friends and workshop content, but you'll get a lot of replayability.			"

												Originally only loved watching my brother play this game. When he switched games, I decided to try it out.Now I'm hooked!Graphics are really nice, extremely customizable too.Creepy specials, and hordes that may, or may not, haunt your dreams.The Sound effects bring out the horrifying potential of the game *grin*.Oh, and the versus mode that either gets you LYFAO, or jittery mad. At the end, what hooked me also, was finding new friends, and enjoying the teamwork you develop as you go on with the games.			"

												First of all: this game is the best Cooperative FPS game you will ever find anywhere. No doubt. But before you actually decide to buy it, you must ask yourself whether you are going to play with random players or a bunch of friends. Make sure to think it through and answer honestly, it's extremely important.Should you decide to play together with your friends: BUY IT! You won't be disappointed in the slightest. This game offers an action packed gameplay, where you try your best to survive the campaign, while tricky and malignant A.I. Director will own you big time.Spawning tank where you least expect it, spawning Jockey to ra*e you should you wander off alone etc. You will find yourself in desperate situations many times, being surrounded by a horde of zombies without ammo, when slightest error means death. You should especially aim for Expert (or Expert Realism) difficulty whenever you feel ready. This way you will go through the truest L4D2 experience. You need reflex, aiming skills, a will to survive and an abillity to make decisions in a fraction of second. But your friends will certainly be there for you. They will share their medications with you, provide a cover with firearm, watch your back or... put a bullet in your back. Friendly fire is certainly here, it's quite an art not to shoot anyone with people running in panic or just changing their position. Crouch a lot so others can shoot above your head and watch your fire. Friendly fire can be even more harmful than few hits from a common infected. If you are not a maniac who loves realism in video games and just look for action packed gameplay with cooperative apporach, there is NO better option than L4D2. Do not play with bots though, they obviously can't handle more than normal difficulty level.Should you decide to play without your friends and just join random players: DO NOT BUY IT!You will fall into despair after playing a round in let's say 80% of lobbies. There will be rookies playing on expert difficulty, people who's never heard of English language and simply can't communicate with you, griefers, people who join the game just to kill you all and then leave, people who waste medications just so you won't have them, those who will incapacitate you numerous time cuz ""you shouldn't get hit, I was aiming above you"", those who will nonchalantly run into your fireline getting incapacitated and telling you to watch your fire etc. VS mode? Ok but you need to understand one very important aspect of it. People will leave immediately when they think they are losing the match and I'm not even joking. You owned the whole opposing team right after start? Well you can be proud, but they will leave the game and the match will end unless someone from your team joins the other one. Best advice would be: show your skills of course but give your enemies at least an impression that they can still win should they try harder. Sounds surreal but you should keep that in mind unless you want your matches to end halfway through.TL;DR: 9.5/10 for the actual game. 0/10 for community. Do not play with randoms, play with your friends.			"

												I would rate this game a 10/10, for it has no co-op zombie game superior.A fantastic game, even in this day and age years after it's original release. The game is strongly being kept alive by various active server communities as well as by the modders and mappers (of which I am one). The community as a whole is rather pass or fail though, in Pub (Public) games you will find all kinds of people, phenominally trolls, team killers, trash talkers, and bad sportsmen; these people alone are the main flaw in what is otherwise a fantastic zombie killing game. This game is easily modded and mapped for, server maintenance is easier than other games like garrysmod (for example) and when you do find friends or friendly people you will have a great time.The gore is 10/10 make sure to set it to HIGH for the full zombie killing effect, blast parts off of those zombies like no tomorrow.The sounds are 10/10, game is well made and the sounds are very definitive, you can use them to identify an infected and where they are.The environments are 10/10, they simply are aesthetically pleasing without being overwhelming.The stock (vanilla) maps (world levels) are numerous and diverse, anything from hospitals to sewers to shopping malls and national forests.The gamemodes are great 10/10:Survival (survive on a clock in a map and go for the gold in increasingly difficult hordes)Mutation (play gamemodes that change the fundaments of the game in unique ways)SingleplayerCo-op (up to 4 people on a stock server)VersusRealism Co-Op (harder co-op, no glows, witches insta kill, etc.)Realism VS (versus with no glows and witches insta kill, etc.)Scavenge (play against the infected and fill up the generator, the more cans the more points)-----The only con is the players you will find, as I said above you will meet the worst of the worst. While hackers are sparse, trolls are not.BUTdont let that discourage you because I have met hundreds of people in L4D2 that I call ""Friend"" and I have found many communities I can call ""Home""			"

												Great game, lots of different game modes like survival, which is similar to black ops zombies, versus, where you play as either a zombie or a survivor, scavenge, where you find cans of gas to fill up a car while fighting away zombies and the best is the campaign, all the levels are really nicely designed and is very fun to play with friends. The workshop is also a great bonus, meaning you can have mods such  custom sound effects, zombies, weapons and custom campaigns and maps. A mod I recommend is the split screen mod, just plug in two controllers and you can play with a friend on one pc. Price drops to less than £4 on sales so can be very good value for money.

												This game promotes highly on teamplays, assisting others as well as communicating with your fellow teammates.There are 2 roles that you can play in this game:* As a human survivor *You will spend just as much time protecting, helping and healing your teammates as the difficulty progresses. Everything from sharing resources to pulling them up off of a ledge. Leaving a teammate behind decreases your chances of survival and running off on your own almost always ends tragically. Hence, you will come to realise that it is fun sticking together and helping one another.  **As a special infected (e.g. Smoker, Boomer, Charger, Jockey, Tank, etc...) [Only in versus mode] **Similar plays are executed from a different perspective. Only when the team that plans and works together as a whole will prevent the survivors from progressing the stage and winning. Attacking alone rarely has much of an effect since you'll get focused as soon as you are spotted, but there are a few opportunities  that allows zombie heroics (like the coveted death charge).This game offers many competitive modes with different difficulty levels of your choice. It also brings teamplay to a whole new level as you challenge higher difficulty as you progress. Worth a shot if you like zombie games! Recommended.			"

-Quick Review-Left 4 Dead 2 (L4D2) is a zombie/horror First Person Shooter, Left 4 Dead 2 was released in 2009 by Valve. There are thirteen campaigns in Left 4 Dead 2, Six of them are from the original Left 4 Dead Series and have the original survivors/characters.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  Left 4 Dead 2 takes place on the top of a hotel building to the site of a Helicopter flying away and the survivors cursing their luck at missing their ticket out of this town. You play as one of four survivors: Coach, Ellis, Nick, and Rochelle.Without giving away any details on what are within the campaign, the names of the campaigns in L4D2 are: Dead Center, The Passing, Dark Carnival, Swamp Fever, Hard Rain, and the Parish. +3 downloadable campaigns. Each Campaign has its own dark theme, and sometimes it's very own zombies.Summary: You've survived the zombie apocalypse, oh no! Just kidding! Now you need to fight your way through the hoards of zombies to survive the zombie apocalypse! Fight through the city, demented circus, swamps, and tall grass fields!Game Play: Left 4 Dead 2 controls like any other FPS with the addition of flashlights, and various other weapons you can swap in-game that you find on the ground. The game lets you chose between 20+ guns and 11 melee weapons. There are a number of game modes in Left 4 Dead 2: Campaign, Single Player, Survival, Versus, Realism Versus, Realism, Scavenge, and Mutation. It's difficult to try to explain general concepts behind each game mode, each one has its own quirks or game play, generally there are two types of game modes: Story related, and Player vs Player.Achievements: Left 4 Dead 2 has 70 Achievements, at the time that I'm writing this review (05/15/15) I have 40 of these achievements... most of which are related to the main campaign. The achievements are split between the campaigns and the extra game modes where you need to play against other players.Price: Left 4 Dead 2 is priced at $19.99 for most people this is a very good deal because of the games replay value, and many features, modes, and campaigns. As always, I suggest waiting for a sale, but this is one of the first steam games I ever purchased......Mostly because of the promise of a friend who'd play it with me, and then played it with me once. Thanks, feeling the love. (I don't buy the games he recommends anymore, unless I plan to play by myself. </3  )Conclusion: In my opinion, Left 4 Dead 2 is one of the best zombie games out there. Giving you a large amount of wiggle room to use your favorite weapons regardless of how good they are, different difficulties, and competitive online play if-you-so-desire.I recommend this game to FPS Junkies, regular steam gamer's, and zombie-game-fanatics.

												Gameplay controls are easy to learn and master. Modding the game, downloading new maps, skins, or different game modes is very easy due to Steam Community Workshop. If some aspect of the game becomes dull and unintriguing, you can always find new content on the Steam Workshop.It's fun at first, but over time it starts lacking the same experience as in the beginning if you keep paying the same game modes.  The community isn't the greatest either when it comes to newer players. You automatically receive a nasty comment when you make a mistake. Game would be more fun if other players weren't as discouraging. But, not all players are bad and rude, there are some players that help you out and teach you other things that you might've not already known.I'm putting this review as recommended but my thoughts about this game are mixed and I'd recommend on some aspects but not on other ones. The biggest downside to this game, I think, is the childish Community, but if you're up for it and don't really care about that, it would be a fun game. On the otherhand, if you dislike childish Communities, don't buy this game unless you're going to play with close friends that don't mind you sucking at first or completely carrying the team depending how good you are.

Cooperative FPS with Zombies! [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]You and 3 people have to find your own way to safety by killing THOUSANDS of zombies. These can be ""special"", with abilities that can immobilize a player or so powerful that can defeat all 4 players by themselves, so you have to listen to every sound and keep your eyes always open. There are dozens of weapons that gets upgraded by the time, but you will soon notice that your best chance of surviving is by helping each other (and the game greatly forces you to do this)!Game is divided in ""campaigns"", each one can be completed in 1-2 hours and has different levels of difficulty. The single player story is nice (but don't expect speeches or cinematics: this game has only action) but the game really shines online: it still has dedicated (and populated) servers and it's very easy to join a game. You can play the official campaigns (they also remade the ones from LFD1), custom ones or some nice variations on the gameplay like humans vs zombies.Replay value is high: you will spend countless hours without noticing! And killing lot of zombies in easy mode is a great stress relief!There is really nothing more you can ask, if not another Left for Dead.Best played with Keyboard and MouseRecommended Buy Price < 30$Score 9/10 "

												Продолжение одного из лучшего кооперативного зомби-шутера! Новые главные горои, новая сюжетная линия. Главные герои добежав до крыши гостиницы, также не успевают на эвакуационный вертолёт. Им приходится пробиватся через толпы зомби к другой точке эвакуации. Из нововведений: система простейшего апгрейда оружия (разные боеприпасы, лазерные целеуказатели), крупнокалиберный пистолет .50 калибра (Desert Eagle), который с пары выстрелов косит любого надоедливого зомби, пулемёт М60, который с разрывными патронами, и целеуказателем, буквально рвёт в клочья любые толпы зомби. Локации стали более дружелюбные, с одной стороны стало играть легче, а с другой сложнее.Оценка: Великолепно 10/10			"

												What made Valve think something was wrong with the first Left 4 Dead to make them release this vastly inferior sequel is beyond me.Gone is the fun of blasting through a moderately challenging campaign with friends in favour of annoying enemies that pin you down and an adaptive difficulty level that just throws cheap attacks at the worst of times.Also, mouse lag is incredibly bad in this game, and only this one from my experience.

												Best Zombie game ever, you can use a lot of custom, mods, skins, maps, campaigns, etc. Gameplay if very fun. L4D2 zombies are the best, if you hide from them in a wall or block that a normal zombie can't reach, this won't stop L4D2 zombies because they know parkour and can reach you in any place, such as towers, walls, roof, etc also when they reach you, they won't bite you, they will punch you, once you are lying in the floor, they will kick you, scumbag zombies!!!

												I'm re-reviewing this game. :3Zombie Apocalypse. Seriously think about it! Could a zombie Apocalypse ever happen? Could we really have it and turns out there are survivors like in here with their humor and will to survive like they do? What would you do if this game came true? Grab your katana and hack 'n slash those zombies! Out of seriousness though, this game is good. But I'm still left wondering what would it be like to be in the survivors' situation...I'd probably walk to the nearest gun store and grab a shotty and start pumping lead through those witches.			"

												There is no other zombie game that can even compete with Left 4 Dead 2. If you are reading this, you have found the perfect co-op zombie shooter. L4D2's gameplay is polished and fun, the game has high replayability, there are many different game modes, and there are tons of awesome mods ranging from character and weapon skins, to full on campaigns and survival maps. L4D2 is also a good game to play with your friends.I highly reccomend Left 4 Dead 2.			"

												Once again Valve set the standard for game development! L4D2 is, on the surface, a simple game based upon easy to understand principles and mechanics... however it is a game of outstanding depth and complexity that takes many 1000s of hours play to master. Recomendations for new players. 1) Learn the game in easy/normal coop mode before moving on to higher levels and competitive modes. 2) Try to make friends with players who are of a similar level as yourself, there is no matchmaking in L4D2 but you will have a far more enjoyable time playing with players like yourself. 3) L4D2 is a TEAM game, if you join a random game your actions could very dramatically effect the progression of the game for the other players, a game that may have been going on for a long time before your arrival. Show respect for other players, if you just want to mess about please don't ruin other peoples games at the same time, this is not TF2 or CS casual where you can jump in and out of games without having any effect on other people playing the game. If you are a solo gamer, who always likes doing their own thing, who plays alone and doenst want to think about or worry about other players, then L4D2 is NOT RECOMMENDED FOR YOU!			"

												the storyline of this game is built around the love between ""coach"" and rochelle, two sassy black characters whose raunchy, sweaty sex gets continously interrupted by hordes of ""zombies"" (this is probably a metaphor for white imperialism or s/t idk) and ellis's rednecky criticisms im currently forgetting who the fourth character is but im sure it involves some other white stereotype; i mean HOW racist is the CHARGER? his arm is CLEARLY based on a bucket of KFC dark meat... wow !!! or is it the tank lol who knows but black power amiriteanyway the games pretty good if ur into long tongues and disfigured mentally challenged children riding on your shoulders and stuffunfortunately the game is populated by a bunch of 8 year boys who cant seem to work a microphone to save their lives, or like 18 year old girls who cant resist the urge to announce the fact that they've saved u ""dont worry i got u!! tee hee ^_^"" congratulations, ur a dumbassanyway after u've survived the campaign and somehow not died due to the ineptitude of the other players, the prize is an empty bucket of fried chicken b/c rochelle ate it all due to her sexual frustration10/10			"

												Great game to play with friends, great hilarious dialogue, namely from Ellis (God bless his soul), great mechanics, and while being fun, also has the aspect of fear, such as when a Smoker is pulling you up a building, and you can't do anything about it. Or when you hear the Tank's music, and you don't know where it is or where it's going to come from. Amazing team-oriented game and probably one of my favorites of all time.			"

												While I am not a l4d2 fan i can recomment this game. (I will be edting this a few times)The pros of this game are:- it has a better engine then 1- for modding there are more options and plugin available- more choices in wepsThe cons are:- you cannot see your own feet- gameplay (smoothness, movements) different and not better then 1- the l4d1 maps are alterd in a way that do no good, example in l4d1 (final map) when you die you get respawned before you start the main event, even if you die again you get respawned. in l4d2 you die you wait no respawn maybe once.

												Even though this game is over 4 years old it still holds up as being one of, if not THE best zombie game on the market. It's not only fun playing single player but it's hilarious when you can get three more friends to join in the zombie killing.This game is a must if you love zombies, and also the old maps from L4D got ported over, singleplayer is awesome, multyplayer is supreme, get ready for some serious fun.

												Left 4 Dead 2 wasn't the kind of game I thought it would be. I suppose I was expecting something along the lines of Dead Island, or Dead Rising, but Left 4 Dead 2 is far from that. It is a survival game, where you rush to get through various area's, collect weapons and healing kits and more, as you fight waves of incoming, increasingly deadly zombies. Some are spitters, some are chargers, almost all of them run directly for you, full sprint, and you must push through to stay alive. Now there are several different ways to play this. I chose a single player game where I was given a team of NPC's to accompany me; However, the campaign mode is a cooperative multiplayer mode, where you play with other players online.  I'm not really a fan of cooperative or competitive multiplayer, so I'm glad Left 4 Dead 2 allowed me to play solo, but there are several other modes available, as well as addon content and more. It's not a bad game, it was actually kind of fun, although I thought it could have been more difficult on the hardest settings. over 130 of my friends have this game so obviously people like it, after playing it for a short time, I can see why.
