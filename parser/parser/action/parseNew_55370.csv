												A great little demo, basically a character creator for the game saints row 3 but free so you dont have to purchase the full game to use it.			"

												If you plan to buy saints row the third, this is a great thing to have. Basically it's for you to make a character, pre-prepared for saints so once oyu get it you can just import the character and away you go.			"

												This is where you can create your SR3 characters / clothing,  put it in the SR3 official site and download it back in game (Pre- launch function)No Cons this time , since it is Free and  was a cool free software before the SR3 launch back in November 2011.*Can still use now if anyone want though			"

												The character creator for Saint's Row. Has a pretty in decent editor (lots of sliders, but not many great results) and plenty of skin/hair choices. A very large amount of tattoo and clothing options available. The body shape editor is weak, and I hate how clothes are labeled, making it hard to find what you want until you memorized the list. The worst part is that your screenshots are private only, so you can't share them without some ingenuity. That said, it's fun to mess around with and a fantastic way to promote a game. More devs should do something like this.			"

												Amazing game, a little short or the story line, but i love the custamization for your character, like none other!  its like Grand theft auto, but better, you have the full gaming experiance, through zombies, wierd people to fight, and wierd guns and cars...All the games for GTA, are so boring, nothing to cusamize no creative ideas, just you kill people and fly in a plane, but in this game, you have planes, cars and awesome weapon...even though there is a limited amount of weapons to chose from, there will always be more they can add.  PLEASE TAKE MY ADVICE, BEST GAME EVAR!! serioulsy can't get enough........and if this doesnt prove much to you...all i got to say is....you can walk around naked!!!			"
