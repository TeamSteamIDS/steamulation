												This is the final Space sim. The absolute, glorious space sim that only a PC can have. You can fly anything. You can buy anything. You won´t be able to even dock a ship at the beggining, you won´t be able to win a single fight at the start, your ship will be a piece of crap and you won´t be able to even dock at the majority of the stations. Random squads of pirate fighthers ten times more well-armed than you will be at the majority of sectors corners. Alien enemies with battleships the size of your city clogging entire sectors will mop the floor with your face for their amusement. Yet, you can trade, steal, find or loot weapons, ships, containers with goods or missiles that worth ten times the price of your little fighther in the shipyards. Find your way around. Get rich. get frindly with one of the races, buy super corvettes that can kick the♥♥♥♥♥of all the enemies that made fun of you, parade in carriers that effortlessly kill hordes of the same things that would vaporize you in the begginning, build your own stations, command remote armies of both honestly bought or captured vessels and conquer entire sectors by force to build factory complexes that put anything ever builded anywhere to shame.

												X3 Terran Conflict, at first when I started this game I was lost on what I could do. Even when I found the script edit I was lost because of how big the game is. I then started to understand what I needed to do in the game. After a little while I found the game to be empty, not much was going on. No real wars or anything like that. I went through some really long missions and was starting to get sick of it already so I started to look for mods for the game. What I found was a rich list of really great mods which brings the game to life, I will add the link to the mods at the end of this review. Wish the mods I give this game a 10/10. Without the mods I give the game a 6/10 or 7/10. The graphics for the game are good and it is fun to fly around and build space stations. I just like war in space so I needed to have something more which the mods gave me. Here is the link for the mods.        http://forum.egosoft.com/search/index.html?template=default&style=default.cssI hope you have as much fun with this game as I do.			"

												There is simply no other single player space simulation out there that even comes close to the depth and complexity of X3 Terran Conflict. A series high point as many improvements to the older X games can be found here in X3TC. Improved interface and UI gives way to full keyboard and mouse control with a new and improved flight model. A much more polished sandbox experience provides a larger and more detailed universe complete with a fully dynamic supply and demand based economy that you can exploit, support, and or decimate on a small scale or faction wide.Improved combat from small fighters and scouts to massive capital ships and carriers. Different variations in ship types with upgradable engines and thrusters. Travel by stargate or use Jump Drives to instantly travel large distances through space. Varied assortment of ship systems and upgrades for specific roles that can all be created by NPC and or players complete with logistics and supply lines. Jump Drives require fuel and larger fleets will require support ships and stations to rearm and refuel.Play to whatever style you favor the most at any time. From small scale skirmishes to large scale epic fleet battles. Traders, explorers, pirates, bounty hunters, mercenaries, haulers, miners, police, military, industrial, and civilian. Micro manage everything or automate it with RPG based NPC fleet and corporation controls. Industrial mining operations and station construction. Name your player, corporation, ships, and all of your assets. Fully simulated sandbox complete with a full array of terran and alien factions. Your actions will effect your reputation around the universe with each one. Play the story at your own pace with full 3D open world space flight where nothing is scripted and anything can happen, even full scale invasions.The universe is alive with friendly, neutral, and hostile NPC's. Some will even offer you random jobs and trade. Fly any ship in the game in first or third person. Hire wingmen to fly your ships and protect your assets. Train soldiers for 3rd person boarding operations and defense. Deploy satelites to create a network for tactical and economic information in realtime. Explore the universe to find hidden stations and derelict ships. Perform spacewalks to claim and or repair ships. Keep track of your thoughts with the captains log as your experience unfolds. The only limitation is your imagination.			"

												First, let me say that I really hate having to leave a negative review for this game. It actually has all the elements in place to make it truly great -- a huge, explorable universe, a complex economy, a huge variety of ships that each have their own use, a nice backstory, good graphics and music -- but it has some really critical flaws with playability that make the overall experience extremely tedious.This is really three games in one: In the early game, it begins as a 3D space combat and flight simulator, and succeeds quite nicely at this. But in the later game, as you accumulate more resources and ships, it becomes more of a economy/trading simulator and fleet command style of game. The critical problem is that the entire interface is designed around first-person navigation and combat, and controlling groups of other ships involves absolutely enormous amounts of navigating through menus for even the simplest task, like ""move here"". Secondly, ships move *very* slowly in this game, even with the built-in option to speed up time by 10X. Thirdly, trading ships, even the upgraded ones that are supposed to be self-sufficient, are stupid and require lots of hand-holding. The net result is that, once you have a large economy and fleet of ships, you will spend 30% of your time in menus, 69% of your time waiting for ships to move from point A to B, and 1% of your time actually doing whatever it is you intended to do in the first place. To build, equip, and move a medium-sized fleet into position to attack something is the work of several hours (not counting the time needed to get money for it), which is just absurd.What this game *desperately* needs is a way to toggle between first-person cockpit style view and a third-person, RTS-style, ""fleet commander"" view to ease management of large numbers of ships.Other minor criticisms are that the voice ""acting"" is generally terrible (major characters are often voiced by obvious computer-generated text-to-speech), and the quests are pretty simple ""go here"" or ""deliver this to there"". The different sectors start to all look the same after awhile. Also, there aren't many capital ship battles, a problem that was fixed in the expansion, X3: Albion Prelude. However, none of these are major problems in what is essentially an open-world game. The only critical problems are the interface and speed of doing anything, but these are enough to make the experience really frustrating.All this said, if you have lot of patience and a lot of time to burn, I would actually recommend this game. For others, no.			"

												Okay, two years after I had bought this game as a part of the X Superbox I feel obliged to write a few words about it. Simply because X3: Terran Conflict (and other X games) are some of the best games EVER made. I would actually hesitate whether to still call this a game. It will steal your life.First things first. It's probably gonna be easy for veterans of previous X games to get into this one, few slight changes but the same mechanic in a nutshell. For the others though, be warned! This game has one of the steepest learning curves I've ever experienced in a game, yet it is also probably the most rewarding. You start out with one ship in a vastness of space and you can virtually build a galactic empire with hundreds of ships, factories, and resources at your disposal. It's not gonna be fast, it's not going to be easy, but it's going to be fun! And you can really do it! No MMO has ever come close to the level of freedom and complexity of all the mechanics in this game. No other sandbox game provides such a beautiful playground for making all your dreams of becoming an overlord come true. It's a gem, an absolute beast of a game, so patched and so loved that even when the developers provided little to no tutorial (very extensive manual however), you can get all the information you need to become great relatively easily.It's difficult to recommend this game to just one group of players. You can get a lot of fighting experience in this one, which I personally enjoy very much, but it's not a simple grabba shipz and go pwn everybody rite nao. No... You have to work on your reputation with a faction, you then get to buy the ship of your dreams, then you have to take it and slap dozens of upgrades on it to make it really shine and then you go get yourself some kickass weapons. I love maintaining all these little details, you can change your weaponry on the fly and tear all kinds of enemies apart. There are limits of course, but lemme tell you... I did destroy a class M6 bomber with about 150 MJ shields with a little M5 ship that only has 1 MJ shield.... I did take out a Kha'ak corvette with my M3 Mamba thanks to an insane firepower provided by Mass Drivers and their non-existent energy consumption. This might not mean anything to you now, but trust me, when you get there and live it... you will remember ;)Ooooor you can pretty much just ignore the whole shooting thing and become a filthy rich and successful trader and buy everyone :D The story isn't important, you write your own. The graphics are very good in my opinion. Music and sounds are more than adequate. Mostly you won't even notice the music, which makes those rare moments of entering a sector that's different than all the others that much more enjoyable.This game is about options, freedom and passion for honing all your skills. And I love it.Personal rating 10/10			"

												It's one of those game you install, play 20 min, uninstall. A year later, install, play 20 min, uninstall. A year later, install, play 20 min, uninstall. Until one day you get past the learning stage. Then quit your job, say goodbye to your friends, X3 is your life now. The keyword here is DEPTH. If you wanna hold your controller, flying from sector to sector, shoot stuff, hear explosion, action-packed, this is not for you. Because all you want is a fly n' shoot experience, in a space setting. X3TC is a SANDBOX game, it gives you a universe, factions with characters, awesome ships, and a dynamic economy. It can be VERY action-packed, but not in the sense of run n' gun. What does dynamic economy mean? That means money doesn't come from no where, NPC actually have to transport products and materials, that means you can compete with them, find a potential market that nobody's aware of, trade illegal goods, establish a monopoly. Nearly everything can be automated. How cool it is to set up traders to trade around the universe automatically for you? ""But I don't care about economy!""Then you have ships, big f*cking ships, small swarming ships, all of them are personally flyable. You can sit on your I-win ship and crusade from sector to sector, or you can zip around in your lighting fast M5 and watch your big destroyers throwing out energy balls. You can board other ships with your marines, force pilots to bail and claim their ships, and even own a large fleet. All of those, build upon one of the most versatile engine I've ever seen. The stuff you want to do is 99% doable, you just don't know how yet. Ask.			"

												Stick with the learning curve and this is one hell of a game. I found watching CdrDaves' tutorial videos immensely helpful as I was about to give up on this and I'm so glad I didn't. The devs need to realise this game could be a monster hit if they actually help people learn to play it. Once you get going, you can pretty much do anything. Start out as trader and make money to create a solar empire? CheckCreate a combat fighter and kick the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of pirates?

												      This is my first and only review I've ever made about anything, but this game truly deserves one. Yes, it is hard to learn to play it, there are so many different things you can do that you will basically use your entire keyboard to organize it all. But if you ever wanted to travel the stars, seek out distant planets, interact with different species, have a fleet of ships at your command, (ships that you yourself can fly) build stations in space, and/or build a galactic empire, hijack ships with trained marines, become a merchant/trader, a pirate, war hero, or simply not be known, watch entire fleets trading fire, use a turret while the ship attacks another, fire a barrage of missles at targets, destroy entire space stations, watch an assortment of people/NPCs live their lives all around you, fly thru asteroid fields, or just blow them up, then this is the game for you.      There is a lot I could say about this game, but in short, it's like nothing I have ever played, and I have been gaming for most of my life. I go on to speak about a few things on X3 Terran Conflict, but to be honest, there is just so much to say about this game, that it would take a heck of a lot of space. But here are a few bits, hope they help.      Nearly every ship in the game you yourself can pilot, from tiny fighters to large warships. You can travel the stars in on a large well defended ship, and then take out a fighter in your bay for a quick spin around the sector. The game itself is beautiful, from the stars to the ships down to the stations. It is all a sight to see.      I've played many space games in my time, but none come close to X3. It does have missions you can take on but at your leisure, it is essentially an open ended game; do what you want, when you want. It will take time to learn everything, but little by little you will pick it all up. You will start slow, no money, a poor ship, and lost in the sea of space, but in no time, you will have the money to improve your ship and its armament, and ofcourse you could always come across a abandoned ship in space.      The sad thing about Terran Conflict is that, dog fights are out of the question. All ships have some or the best weapons in the game so you are stuck flying a larger ship with better defenses. Not that you can't use a fighter class, it's just that you will die often, so make sure to save often. For this reason I would recommend you start with X3 Reunion. While dog fights in Terran Conflict are almost suicide, in Reunion they are a must; while also being fun. I myself played Reunion first and learned the basics thru that game, and that made Terran Conflict much easier to learn. Terran Conflict is just a much faster paced game.      I highly recommend this game to all space lovers, for I never felt closer to space than I have while playing this game. The mechanics are hard to learn but great once you get the hang of it. The visuals are a sight to see, and the ability to almost do anything you want is great. As I told a friend once, you could be flying to a far off place, while out of no where your trade ship is being attacked, while one of your stations is also being attacked, while your sector is being invaded, while your patrol fleet is being ambushed, all in a split second. It is truly something.      These few points and explanations do not do it justice, only playing it will.			"

												Great big wall of text alert, because this ridiculous insane game needs it.This game. This ♥♥♥♥ing monster of a game. This is by far the hardest game for me to describe to anyone. It's seriously difficult. You can call it a space shooter sim sandbox 4X RTS economics game and you wouldn't be wrong, but that still barely explains anything about this game. I'm not sure if I can fully explain this game in one review, so I won't try to. It's probably best you jump into it and explore things for yourself. It'll be overwhelming and you'll have no idea what to do, and that's alright. I can at least attempt to write out, why I specifically love this game so much.I guess to start off, I'll try to generalize my feelings into a focused idea. The best I can come up with, is a single word, and that's ""immersion."" This game, is immersive. Partially in the sense, that you're immersed in an ocean of♥♥♥♥♥♥to do, but also, because almost of how thorough this game gets into simulating things, it feels ""real"" or ""alive."" I'll try to explain a bit more. If you want to skip any one part of this review, it'd probably be this next section.I'll start by painting a bit of a picture of a game with some time put into it. You've established a headquarters in an abandoned sector. You have your own trading empire consisting of more than 40 trade ships, roaming around the galaxy finding deals, buying low and selling high. You've used the resulting profits to create a chain of factories. These factories have their own trade ships, of which a few will go out and gather resources such as Ore and Energy Cells, which the factories need to create products such as weapons and missiles. Not only are your factories' ships buying these resources from other NPC factories (or perhaps your own), but they're also selling off your products to other factories, or to trading posts for NPCs to purchase. You've set a threshold on these products, so that a portion of them are stored at your headquarters instead of being sold off.This stock at the HQ is for your military fleet, consisting of a handful of capital ships (think something like the Imperial Destroyer big flying Dorito ships from Star Wars), with escorts each of smaller ships, like frigates (miniature capitals that are faster but less armed and armored) and corvettes (something like the Millenium Falcon. They're middle-of-the-road in size, speed, and power. Jack of all trades). Each of *those* categories are escorted by fighter ships, the small fast ships made for dogfighting and attack runs, usually with other fighters or if en masse, they can also bug larger ships very effectively. In addition, some capitals act as aircraft carriers, and you can dock tens of fighters and sometimes corvettes to these ships, for mass transportation or protection using the larger ships jump drive, which the smaller ships can't mount or carry much fuel for. Much like a real aircraft carrier.So you've got a fleet of traders roaming the universe making money by finding good deals, you've got a chain of factories buying goods from other NPC traders or factories and turning them into more useful products, which are both sold back into the stream of goods, and stored at your home base for use on your own ships. These ships being your military presence, with which you can protect your own assets from marauding pirates, unruly competitors, rampaging AI-gone-bad, or you can be the aggressor and destroy some nearby competition, at the expense of your relationships with the local law enforcement.What I love about this game, is that you can do *AAAAALLLL* of that, and you can fly around in your own ship, and individually order around *AAAAALLLL* of those ships, or automate them to repeatable jobs and forget about them, and you can follow them across the universe as they do their job. Everything you do in this game, actually *happens*. Make a trader to buy and sell at profitable prices? You can literally watch him fly around, buying things from factories that actually have an overabundance of products, selling for cheap. Then he'll fly around, selling those things to other factories or trading posts, that are in need of those products, buying them at a high price. Your factories follow these rules too, and when they sell at a low price, more NPC traders will buy from them. When they buy at a high price, more NPC traders will sell to them. The NPCs are like this too. You can follow them, from their own home factory, straight to yours. You'll watch them dock, buy your♥♥♥♥♥♥ undock, and fly back home to return it. And there are *hundreds* of other factories and *thousands* of other ships, all doing this everywhere all the time, whether you're nearby or not.Those military ships you have? Order them to attack an entire sector. You can jump into this sector yourself, and watch each and every one of your 100+ individual ships fight, fly around, destroy enemies, or get destroyed themselves, all in real-time. They *actually go and do the♥♥♥♥♥♥you tell them to do*. This game rarely takes shortcuts. It does everything *thoroughly*, and you can watch *nearly all of it* in-person from your own cockpit, as well as in a different sector via the map, or you can even be in the ship that's doing it, running on autopilot or manual control.If you managed to stick around and read all of this review so far, I really appreciate it. But do you see all this crap I just wrote? I had to cut myself short so I wouldn't write an entire novel. And I wasn't even trying to explain the game itself, just what I like about it. *That's* how damn hard it is to describe anything about it to someone. It's just so special and complex. It really deserves the ""simulation"" tag, because I'll be damned if I've ever played another game that captures this same feeling of ""I have 1000 AI units under my control, and I can tell them all to do something different, and I can actually watch them do all these things as if I were doing it myself, along with the million other AI ships out of my control in the universe, and the universe will react to it."" It's just.... so authentic.Authentic, and immersive. A sandbox the size of the Milky Way, filled with more toys than you can begin to imagine, all seemingly with a will of their own, that react to your actions.Go play this game. It's not perfect, but go play it anyway. Overcome the steep learning curve, the technical hurdles, the time sink, all of it. Go play this game, because it *deserves* to be played. It deserves your time, your attention, your effort, and your curiosity, because underneath whatever problems it may have, is something truly beautiful and wonderous. Go play this game, and then get Albion Prelude, and play it all over again. And then when you feel like you're ready for something else, start throwing mods on them. The king of mods for AP, Litcube's Universe, may as well be X3.5, and it's what I'm currently on. It fixes some of the flaws of the game and for me at least, is my new default/vanilla from which I add any further mods to.Oh and if it seems like I'm talking about this game, more than what I've played (111.7 hours according to Steam atm), then that's just because for both TC and AP I moved to non-steam exe's available for download on the developer's website. My true hours are between 1.5x and double the amount shown on steam, for both Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude. Litcube's Universe alone would probably triple my AP hours were it counted.			"

												Hello everybody and sorry for my bad english, it's not my native language,at first, this is a game with a real high learning curve, the tutorial is quite short and then it belongs to you, what happens next. In the first hours it is annoying, when you not know the predecessors. But with a little experience it will be the spacesim of your dreams. Fantastic artwork, genius music and a good story. Nevertheless you are not bound to the story, you can do whatever you like. Become a traider or a pirate, a terran military ship commander or whatever else. And the greatest thing is the modding community, with a lot of mods and scripts. If you like spacesims, then X3 is the one of the best sims you can get.Now for the bad stuff: The control is getting used to, ok I never tried the game with a pad, only with mouse and keyboard. In the later stages it is a lot about micromanagement to get enough money to achieve one of the big and profitable facilities.And also there are a lot of nice scripts and guides in the Egosoft Forum on german and english.Greets fromMeg "

												Don't buy this unless you have the time to dedicate days to learning even the basics. Massive learning curve and a very tedious start make the game unbearable boring for the first several hours. If you happen to start near a nebula and you want to go anywhere, your screwed because you can't see anything outside of a tiny radious around you. The combat is boring and very finicky, and if bounty hunting your kills have a high chance of being stolen by a random passerby which make everything but a trader orientated start ridiculously hard.Some of the positives are the freedom it gives you, even if it is a bit much for a beginner. The variety is also a nice touch, many different ships from different civilizations. Being able to just trade, just bounty hunt, or be an imperialist are all right there. Much like a single-player EvE but without the overly aggresive die hards playing it.Would I recommend this to anyone I know or in general most people? No, but for some it would be something they love. That's what it seems like though, you either love or hate the game. The game design is amazing but immense and complicated, not for most. I started to enjoy the game after the long initial grind but eventually lost interest because it didn't hold my attention like most games in my library. Be wary when purchasing, learn about it and watch gameplay before purchasing.*Important* It seems theres a bunch of people just rating ""Unhelpful"" on all negative reviews, and as such do not pay attention to negative reviews helpful ratings. Read a bunch of negative reviews and it will start to make sense why these reviews are negative.			"

												A worthy successor to X3: Reunion. With more ships (including bombers, which are a powerful addition for anti-capital ship combat). But lets not forget the biggest deal of all. You can play as a Terran!  At long last we have seen our Terran brothers again, and can even play as them!Pro:+Great Story! (You'll need context of the other games to fully understand it though)+Wide variety of mission types Combat missions alone include assassinations, defend a station, patrols, escorts, and even convoy hunting,  Trade missions have you supplying or delivering wares to stations, or buying used ships (can be a great way to turn a profit when you repair it yourself). Build missions to have you build stations for the universe (thats right, get PAID to build stations. Last type of missions are the ""think"" missions, which have you transporting passengers, scanning asteroids, returning stolen or abandoned ships, tracking ships, etc.+Randomly generated missions+Vast options of ships/equipment to choose from. (Scout ships, interceptors, heavy fighters, bombers, transport freighter normal/heavy/super freigther, ""Transport Large"" (capital ship sized transport ship), corvettes (like a small frigate), frigates, destroyers and carriers.+Player HQ (when unlocked) can reverse engineer ships (possibly jump beacons if you can get enough!) build ships, and house many ships, +Living breathing universe. All those ships you see flying somewhere are doing things around the universe. Be it supplying a station somewhere, patrolling the sectors for hostiles. (Dont worry, escorts and the various ships respawn over time ... stations on the other hand ... dont (exception being shipyards and equipment docks)+Reputation system for factions (how friendly/hostile they are to you, your clearence from shipyards, trading discounts, etc.)+Autopilot!. Game can run autonomously in trade/exploration/combat aspects. Just buy the ships, buy the ship software from military bases and equipment docks. And you can have self sufficient fleets that can even automatically do trading across the universe for you (with Trade software MK3).+Build your own stations. You can contribute to the universe and turn a decent profit when built on the right spots. Especially useful for obtaining some of those harder to obtain wares.+Piracy, you can steal from freighters, capture capital ships, and smuggle illegal goods accross sectors.Cons:- Starts off a little slow. Because it takes a bit of time to work your way up (more from finances than from reputation; which is slightly hard to raise, easy to destroy).-A little buggy. two story missions can be rather difficult, and can break if you arent careful (Mission six of Terran Conflict can break, so make a special save before you start it). and Mission seven can be annoying because you have to try to board and steal a capital ship (but dont worry, after a time your allies do it for you). Other than that, its pretty much bug free!- Autopilot can be clunky sometimes. Such as when navigating around the massive Terran stations, or when flying the  bigger ships.- Relatively steep learning curve. This is for those who havent played any X games. If you havent, I suggest doing the tutorial (which only teaches you how to fly and communicate. Then reading up on the basics of trading, or of things in general (could learn even helpful basics in combat)			"

												Games awesome, even better with mods. My only complaint is once I became a billionaire and had an army under my control, I felt hardly rewarded. The climb to greatness was incredibly fun and challenging but once you get there you feel like theres not much more to do. I planned on destroying the borons entirely but the effort required and pay off wasn't worth it. Everytime I play this game, and x3 reunion (299 hrs) and get to the end game I do not feel like I really did anything great.			"

												Read all the other reviews to see if this game is for you--I'm here to tell you how to get started instead.First of all, buy the Albion Prelude DLC and install the bonus packs. It's a far superior game with them installed, with so much more to do, and if you think you're missing out on Terran Conflict content then you can just go back and play that instead, they're completely interchangeable.  - When you begin a game, go through the options and make sure everything is up to scratch--turn on numerical shield and hull, set SETA to 10x, set one of the monitors to watch your target. Read through all of the controls to learn how to play, and mess around until you think you've got the hang of it.  - Combat is simple--don't use the mouse to fire, instead use control as it auto-aims and will save you so much time and effort, especially when you've got Fighter Command Software Mk.2.  - Explore the sectors until you find an Equipment Dock that sells Docking Computers, and do whatever you have to do to buy one. The Docking Computer instantly docks with any station provided you are within 3km of it, removing the risk of dying by auto-pilot.  - In the same vein, do whatever you can to buy a Trading System Extension--this will allow you to see what wares a station has for sale without needing to be docked at it, as long as you have a ship in that sector. Some good ships for any class that will give you a bit of a head start are the Teladi Kestrel (Fastest ship in the game, great for exploring and doing non-combat missions), the OTAS Mistral (Fastest freighter in the game, makes commerce and trading much more bearable), the Terran Fenrir (One of the best fighters in the game with solid shielding and great weapon recharge rate, but only available in Albion Prelude) and the Argon Centaur (One of the earliest accessible corvettes, and a great standing stone for the rest of the game). Additionally, the modding community for this game is huge, with total conversion mods such as the X-Tended Mod, which plants you in a completely new universe, and the X3 Rebalance Mod, which overhauls many of the game's mechanics and adds many fun new ones. If you don't like it vanilla, do take a look around. This game's learning curve is quite steep, but once you know how to avoid its annoyances and make use of some of its better features, it is truly one of the most brilliant space sims around. I hope you enjoy it.			"

												I recommend because I am a space sim junkie. However, I would NOT recommend it to people without lots of patience or that aren't willing to learn a lot to play this game more properly.To those that are willing, this game has a lot of depth. At first, you start either as an Argon or Terran and, as you complete some of the game's ""story"" missions, you'll unlock different starts.The default control bindings are also a mess, you will want to change some them. And SETA speed. You'll be using that thing more often than anything, so set it to 10x.Flying is pretty simple once you properly bind (de)acceleration. Auto-pilot helps a lot, but other times it is a freaking burden that will fly your ship on a collision course with something else.Dogfights aren't entirely fun if you're trying to hunt down scout ships, M5, the fastest class. Most of your shots won't hit. And most ships are slow. As in, sometimes slower than sports cars. However, when you get to fight larger targets, you really feel the thrill of the fight. It's not as fun as Freelancer, but it can be fun.After saying so many things that would actually make one want to turn their back, why I still recommend it? Because it offers you the chance to control capital ships, direct trade and military fleets as big as your credits can buy (and use them to destroy nearly everything in every sector), reverse engineer some ship designs that you can't buy (like the Xenon ships) and create giant self-sustaining industrial complexes that keep the credits pumping into your account.Also, there are mods. You want Star Trek ships? There are mods that add them. Star Wars? Same thing. Other sci fi shows? Probably there too. You can even get a Normandy SR2!			"

												So i dont have a whole lot of hours in the game yet but here's what i think of it so farPro:-you can do just about anything (pirate, join the army, trade, mine, transport goods, build your own factories!)-you can attack anyone and any faction-you can pilot pretty much any ship you see-you can own multiple ships and give orders (effectively becoming your own empire)Cons:-the game is ""harder"" to pick up than most. This however is not to say its all that difficult-Some missions/sides are next to unrealistic to complete IE, ""shoot this box"" while my ship had not even started with a weapon-with a very similar feel to eve but a SP version there can be some wait times if you are traveling across the galaxyI'll probably update this review as i throw my life away into the game. Hope this helps.			"

												Alright, I do believe I now have sufficient experience with this game to write a review. I will, however, reduce all of my thoughts to simple bullet points for ease of reading:- Highly immersive...as in, time gets away from you when playing this game- Very complex...but the kind of complexity that a quality-seeking gamer such as yourself admires- Open world...the universe is gigantic and it is living and breathing, always making for new and fun experiences- Customization...to the point of making your own thriving empire, both for trading and for military purposesThis game is fantastic and once you get used to the gameplay style and the controls it becomes an amazingly deep experience. Highly recommended.			"

												Slow paced and tedious with a steep learning curve. I know several people that LOVE this game but it is not for everyone. It is free roaming and you can choose how you play to an extent but there is no real ""path."" You will spend most of your time flying slowly through space (even with SETA) than actually progressing. I do like the vastness of the game and it is beautiful to look at. I would recommend watching someone stream this game live or play it before you buy as it is NOT for everyone. Do not watch youtube videos on it because they will likely cut out all of the boring parts of it.With all that said it IS a good game but requires a certain type of player to really enjoy it.			"

												This is the game for the space nerds. It's looking a little dated these days and god knows, there's more menus and options than you can shake a stick at but for the time invested, you get a huge reward. If you're a fan of space and the idea of fighting, building and trading in a reactive virtual economy, X3 Terran Conflict will blow your mind. Literally if you're not careful.Personally, setting up my own major trade empire and exploring the farthest regions of space in my ship is an absolute joy, especially when there's something illegal burning between two fingers on my left hand and Planet Caravan by Black Sabbath playing in the background.X3 Terran Conflict is a huge game. Although there is a ""plot"" or quest, you can choose not to follow it. I see it as a huge, open space sandbox that I can sink hours of blissful time and purpose in one sitting. Once you've broken through the learning curve and are used to the menus it's a real joy.Although it does support the Xbox gamepad, it's best played with mouse and keyboard in my opinion. Don't buy this game unless you're willing to sink literally hours of your time in to the immersive universe and be prepared to do some learning ebfore you can play it properly.			"

												- you can enter any ship in the game and pilot it from first person view- you can own an unlimited number of ships and switch between them as you like- you can control any ship that you are not flying personally, via remote commands- hundreds of unique ships, down from the smallest fighters to capital ships and carriers, missile frigates, troop transports, freighters. Yeah, you can pilot each of them in first person.- you can customize each of your ships' weapon loadouts. - be a trader only, get rich then buy the big guns/ships to do your fighting for you. Or be a combat ace and get all the kills yourself. - ship boarding, being a pirate is viable.- Some people complain about the UI, but the key is to use keyboard shortcuts to issue commands. Now it's second nature and I only use mouse for aiming and steering.- watch CdrDave's videos on Youtube for a good intro, his tutorials make a good progression and gets you into the habit of using keyboard shortcuts.- game aged well, great graphics for a 2008 game.- great long quest line that sucks you in.- ""Betty"" the ingame computerized voice is too cool.

												X3: Terran Conflict is a massive game, which works both for and against it. If you invest enough time into this game you can create sprawling industrial complexes and an armada of warships. Unfortunately, after playing the game for a relatively brief amount of time I grew unable to care less about having an empire in the X3 universe. If I had to describe this game in a few words those words would be: monotonous, insipid, and glitchy.As soon as I started playing the game my first mission was to go on patrol. I believe I had to patrol four or five times within the first five hours of the game. Patrolling missions mostly consist of floating around aimlessly and possibly blowing a few enemies up. There were also some combat missions, but I found those to be equally boring. To fight enemies you simply fly within their proximity and hold the right mouse button while aiming over a reticle. Combat could have benefitted immensely from flanking bonuses as well as bonuses for strategically targeting different ship components.There are several other types of missions as well but they all primarily consisted of going from point A to point B and accomplishing eerily similar tasks. These shortcomings in mission and combat design could have been mitigated by the presence of interesting characters and an engaging story. Instead these shortcomings are amplified by a cast of annoying characters that spew forth inane drivel and a story that moves at a snail’s pace. The dialogue isn’t necessarily bad (or interesting) but the voiceover work is unbelievably annoying. Every character I encountered spoke as if they were poorly reading from a script, exhibiting inexplicable tonal shifts and awkward pauses.Despite all of the aforementioned flaws I still intended to continue playing this game. After getting a more complete sense of the games mechanics and contents this changed. To start doing anything really profitable in this game, such as starting a factory, a number of exceedingly expensive components are required. This wouldn’t really be a problem if acquiring credits were fun or enjoyable, but this is not the case.Every aspect of this game demands that you waste your time to accomplish anything. Travel times are ridiculously high even when you use a time accelerator. Missions that award you anything more than a pittance are incredibly hard to find and are frequently completed by some other spacefarer before you even get half way to your destination. Additionally, as stated before, most missions just involve going from point A to point B and are typically monotonous. To make things worse, the time accelerator is actually a ship component that needs to be bought. The ship you begin the game with will always have an accelerator, but several of the ships I acquired didn’t have that functionality immediately. Another thing I found to be quite annoying was the implementation of this time acceleration mechanic. Initializing time acceleration literally makes the game process two to ten times faster. This would probably be fine if the AI could handle it, but apparently it can’t. One of my AI ships smashed into a wall and exploded when I activated time acceleration, and many of the other ships in the area started acting nonsensically as well.There are many other issues that I could address in more detail, but the critical flaw of this game for me is relatively simple. X3: Terran Conflict just isn’t fun to play. I really wanted to like X3: TC but I found that I was just forcing myself to play in the otiose hope that I might actually have fun playing this game. I’m sure someone would really enjoy this game and its wealth of content but that someone isn’t me. I simply can’t recommend X3: Terran Conflict to anyone based on my experience with it.Edit: I removed a rather hyperbolic statement from the last paragraph. I never said anything about the interesting ship, space station and alien designs either. The game has a unique aesthetic and the overall design of ships, infrastructure and organisms are pretty nice. That's also pretty much the only nice thing I have to say about this game though.			"

												So far, I've put over 160 hours into this game, and I plan on putting many more into it. One of the mane reasons why I chose to purchase X3 was because of the fact that you're given a choice to pilot virtualy every ship in the game, rather than being forced to stay confined to fighters (and maybe freighters if you're lucky *sarcasm). The game dose have a steep learning curve, but there are excelent sets of tutorials put out by CdrDrive, and TheXPGamers that make it very easy to get past. Once you get past the learning curve, the game is a tone of fun, but also very time consuming because of all the research you have to do when purchasing and outfitting a new ship; the reason for this is because ships sold on the market come only with basic systems (and sometimes none at all) so you'll usually find yourself traveling to different sectors for all the ship systems you need/want. The world itself is very expansive and you're able to do anything from being a trader, selling goods to the highest bidder, to a warlord, building a large fleet and capturing sectors. If you like openworld sandbox games that are extremely in-depth that take time to play I highly recomend X3: Terran Conflict. If you want to play a fast and easy game that has little to no learning curve, or you simply don't have the time for such a game, then you might just want to hold off on this game for now (but I still recomend that you at least try it).

												So a friend watching me play this game totally engrossed asked me where the fun was, and I looked up from my laptop long enough to think about that question and realize that I didn't really know. Was the fun in the trading economic parts of the game? No, sending your trading convoys from system to system to try and hawk off those Teladi Sun Flowers is more tedious than ""fun"" by any conventional means. Was the fun in exploring the galaxy and flying from system to system? No, ships are too slow and most of the time you'll be flying to system on autopilot while your SETA (a device that speeds up gameplay) does all the work there. Is the fun in the combat? At least that's fun, right? I hate to break it to you, but the combat can get wearily repetative real quick, and the intense dog-fights of the early game disappear as soon as you get a corvette class ship. In all honesty, I have no idea where the fun is in this game, but it's there, alright. It's gripping, frantic, and you'll be so invested in your little ships that you'll be crying at the screen once you see a Xenon Q drop into the sector and blow one of your trading ships back to whatever year this game was made in. That said, this game is by far one of the most difficult that I have played in a while and I wouldn't recommend it to just anybody. X3 drops your right into a hostile universe of intergalatic trade and warfare with little explanation of what to do, how to do it, and very little to do anything with. How are you supposed to survive, let alone succeed in this universe? The same way you do in any capitalist society: pull yourself up by your ♥♥♥♥ing bootstraps you lazy, entitled, leech. The previous generations of spacefarers didn't have anything when they made a go at it so ♥♥♥♥ you for thinking you're going to get off so easily. (Said previous spacefarers also didn't have anywhere near as many challanges to face as you will, but just try explaining that to them).In all seriousness though, newcomers will have a serious learning curve thrown at them and some unfortunate bugs to worry about. For example, X3 has one of the most realistic functioning economy's in any game, but it often works too well. GoD (don't ask me what that stands for) will spawn and remove factories based on supply and demand. Makes sense, right? Factories that move product obviously stay in business in the real world while those that don't get shut down. Where's the problem with that? Well, a few of the races don't HAVE the infrastructure to maintain a functioning economy because the devs didn't think it through enough and so the factories that produce the only compatible missiles and ammo for your ship might just one day disappear and leave you high and dry. Veteran players figured this out a long time ago and have their work arounds; new players, however, beware. If you get this game, make sure to consult the forums for advice, tactics, and warnings (disappearing factories aren't the only bugs to be mindful of) from those more experienced capitalists. Have fun.			"

												This is game is praised for finally being involved with the Earth race since I waited 10 years back in X-BTF for the ""Return to Earth"" storyline and flying on new Earth built ships. The GFX and quality is truly amazing and the controls are not bad.Despite trying to climb up the steep learning curve, this game should be awarded and listed as the best unoffical successor to Elite or Frontier: Elite II, due to the high similarities. Also, my retail version of this game had some bugs since I first bought it when it was on the market since it's debut. Bare in mind it isn't uncommon that most Modern games around in this decade, can have a dodgy headstart. So please make sure you report any important bugs to EgoSoft Forums provided. They cannot help you if you cannot explain the bug assertively and clearly to them. And if you do decide to play a game like this, don't get committed to start a space campaign that you want to keep in the long term. Because EgoSoft made some changes back in X-Tension v1.4 near 2000 when my saves needed replaced for the TL class for X-Tension v2. And I won't be surprised that happened for X3TC when the patch reached to v3 onwards.One very important note, if you use Money Cheat, Reputation Cheat or use Script Editor, you will no longer unlock achievements, so DON'T use any Cheats or Mods. Personally I use Money Cheat on this game predecessor as I really didn't want to waste time rebuilding my Space Empire and Reputation as that will take months - years even to complete this game. But this game is the best of all of the X-Series game so far, and it is more enhanced and easy-to-use in comparsion to X3: Reunion.So my simple final advice is: No Money Cheat, no modifications and use the spoilers at your own risk for when you are totally stuck!

												(Review for Albion Prelude Addon since it's awesome. Terran Conflict has more story but is less optimized. Also my hours sank into this game at release, before steam)Forget about half♥♥♥♥♥casual games like Elite: Dangerous. This is the best space game so far. It has everything you'd want: A LOT of different ships to fly, exploration, itemization, complex economy, several factions to interact with different personalities and likes/dislikes, build / take space stations, stuff to do / explore even late in the game and a huge amount of freedom in what to do. Capture ships, steal loads, trade illegal stuff (weapons, drugs) or just let your AI Pilotfleet trade while you join an army, it's really up to you. Downside: You should look up some stuff! Many different items and customisations for your ship or goods mean to read about them. Some information is not easy to find at first, but it's worth it. It's a deep and complex space-/fight-/trade simulation which is it's strongest point. What I'd want from x4: Stay the same. Be complex, be deep! We have enough of the shallow crossover plattform games with the  fly-in-emptyness-and-don't-do-much-at-all♥♥♥♥♥♥ We have enough of the stripped down games that are easy to get into but are boring after the first 5 hours.<3 X3			"

												My favorite space game. Too bad its starting to show its age, but if you haven't played it before, it's great fun. If you like flying multiple types of ships, from small fighters to giant battleships, and creating a spaceship fleet to fight or trade for you, then building your own empire, with your own stations producing eveything you need, including new ships, this is the game for you. Beware that it doesn't have such great massive quests unfortunately, and they are quite buggy with poor voice acting, but some of them are fun and with awesome rewards. And if you get this, get the expansion, Albion Prelude, its essential. Also find the forums and install mods, especially XRM and IEX.			"

												Pretty good. i'll need to do more missions to get a better feel, but just getting lost in the exploration of the game and controls... b/c my god... the interface!!!! wow. space battles/control is not bad. few glitches, but minor and mostly audio. autopilot seems like its on drugs sometimes, but... still. not bad. is this game exciting and fast paced? meh.... some of the fights aren't bad.... but i wouldn't call this a fast paced game.exciting? not so much.interesting? definitely. mostly based around trading and quests, makes a person think and explore rather than mindlessly shoot stuff down.would I reccomend this game? Given how light it is on system requirements (yay! runs on my old laptop!) Most definitely, especially if you can get a coupon or on sale. already wasted almost 2 days on it off n on, can't say i've accomplished a damn thing of note in it, but enjoyed every moment of it exploring this game trying to learn how it worked.bonuses: look into the script mods. big help. worth reading up on. hit the forums n youtube.Definitely delivers a decent portion of satisfaction for any space game fan.much better than *shudder* Iron Sky... or Star Trek Online *vomit*			"

The Short VersionRecommended with caution. It's really not for everyone, but if you can get into it, X3 is fun as all hell.The Long VersionLet me get this out of the way:If you don't read the damn manual, or watch some kind of tutorial, you're going to ♥♥♥♥ing hate this game. There's no getting around it.X3 has a REALLY steep learning curve, and it really is buried in menus. If you don't take the time to learn the game, you won't have fun with it. It's as simple as that. You can do an in-game tutorial, but it's nothing short of worthless. It'll teach you how to fly your spacecraft, but you can figure that out with the manual that you should read anyway.But that being said... If you're willing to take the time to learn how to play, This is one of the best space games on Steam. But it's not like Elite: Dangerous where you can more or less just jump in and go.I will say that most of the game really is just flying from station to station and trading resources, so if that's not what you're into, you might want to skip this. Later in the game, you end up building up a mighty empire, and at that point you end up spending much more time micro-managing shipments to and from your stations, maximizing production of goods without expending too much of your profit, and from there you spend almost all your time balls-deep in a couple dozen menus.I probably didn't make that sound very appealing, but that's because at face-value it really isn't. But there is something strangely captivating about the whole experience, if you can get into it. I spent about 5 and a half hours today flying from solar production plants to mining facilities, shuttling energy cells for maximum profit. That's basically all I did all day, and I didn't even realise how much time I had wasted. Your experience may vary, but... I recommend at least picking it up and trying it, if you've got some money to blow. You might end up getting a refund though, and if you do, try out something like Starpoint Gemini 2. It's a lot like X3, but it's much simpler, and much easier to get into.			"

Posted: December 15, 2014
												(Note: this is a joint review of both the Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude variants of X3; thus, I'll post the same text to both.)I **really** wanted to like this game. I *really* did. Let me explain why.I'm a veteran video game space cadet. I played the original Elite and Wing Commander on Commodore 64, and lots like them, since. I've played EVE Online off-and-on since Trinity (~ 2007). I ***LOVE, LOVE, LOVE*** spaceflight games that are ""sandbox-y"" for almost as long as I've been playing video games, and that's been too long a period of time (I'm now 41).The Egosoft team was obviously ambitious. And, in some core ways, they succeeded. But the whole thing ultimately feels rushed.In the end... At minimum, there are five things keep me from recommending this game.(01) - There's no clearly-evident, gradual-slope difficulty ramp, and what you see is not always what you get. One minute, you're doing something that you percieve is very easy, is in fact very easy, and you are succeeding quite well... And the next minute, you're doing something that you percieve to be (very) easy, is in fact very difficult, and ends up being effectively suicidal as a consequence. One ends up having to revert to game saves frequently before gaining a good feel for that the *real* difficulty of various things are, as trial-and-error appears to be the only logical path towards mapping out a successful long-term course of action for oneself.(02) - The accelerated time mechanism... Isn't accellerated enough. 600% of real-time is the max; in fact, it should be variable, with max *at least* %1,000, given the distance between various objects of interest, and the max velocities of the majority of craft in the game (esp. in the early game). Expect to spend LOTS of time simply staring at your screen whilst you travel from place to place. For me... It got *really* old after a while. Asteroid mining in EVE Online came to mind - a great ""second screen"" experience whilst your primary focus is on something else (work-related?)... But boring-as-hell if you have nothing else to do at that time. Or, at least, it *would* be a great second-screen experience, if the next line-item wasn't true.(03) - The auto-pilot is borderline suicidal. It's certainly borderline schitzophrenic. At minimum, it's not consistently reliable for what one would expect to rely upon an autopilot for: performing the mundane, common tasks associated with piloting a craft, without harming the vehicle or its contents. Simply put... It's difficult, if not impossible, to ""trust"" the autopilot within confined, or crowded, space... Which means its use is circumstantial... Which erodes the value of such. (IMO, anyway.) It results in lots of time ""babysitting"" the craft when (IMO) one shouldn't have to. If this one thing were fixed... I would borderline-recommend this game for use as at least a ""second screen"" experience (as described above). But, as it presently stands, I would distrated too often by my ""babysitting duties"". :-((04) - The tutorial sub-system is *far* from complete. I appreciate the fact that Egosoft respects their customer base enough to deliberately avoid ""hand-holding them"" through everything... And I actually *like* the idea, in concept, of forcing the player to learn the majority of the game through actual experience. But there are better ways to do the latter - EVE Online provides some excellent examples. For a game this complex... Just teaching them how to move around, and them leaving them to their own devices, with one having to traverse the majority of their local solar system in order to learn enough subsequent basics to gain an idea as to what their options are (much less decide upon a course of action in the direction they wish) is a bit ridiculous, IMO. It's as if the game's creators expected anyone buying the game to have prior experience with a variety of similar-genre games in the past, such that they would ""just know"" what their options are, thus lessening the tutorial/ training burden. It's pretty lame, in this respect.(05) There's no context-sensitive help to speak of (that I could see), beyond short descriptions of various items/ entities. I could forgive (04) if there was strong (05) present... But there isn't. I shouldn't feel obligated to alt-tab to/from my web browser to search the web for basic how-tos, as I play along, to make up for the lack of available in-game documentation.In short... This game feels like it was the work of a small, highly-ambitious, highly-skilled development team... Who hit a budgetary/ deadline wall before this could be fully baked... And, like many rushed programming projects... The documentation is the first to be sacrificed at the altar of timelines and budget constraints.Again... I would *really* like to recommend this game... But, as I've played it over the last few days... I just can't. And that makes me sad. :-(			"

												I read a lot of the reviews before buying and now having put a fair bit of time into it (900+ hours) I can appreciate both sides of the argument.  However personally, I absolutely love this game.This is definitely the spiritual successor to the original Elite.  The initial trade runs to build up some credits evokes strong memories of the Lave to Leesti run for those old enough to remember such things.  Fortunately though the inhabitants of this universe haven’t felt the need to have their space stations constantly spin in order to make docking a nightmare…Yet it goes much beyond that.  As others have mentioned, this soon morphs into an empire management style game.  This seems to upset some, but there isn’t anything forcing people to spend most of their time on this aspect of the game.  The various plot line missions encourage you to be the pilot doing most of the action (hub plot excluded) and there is always something to keep you going.It’s not all roses in the garden though.  In the early hours of the game, the computer generated voices can grate a bit, but now they seem to fit quite well with the various races.  The UI is functional rather than pretty.  And the AI…  It’s quite the little tease.  You never know when it is going to get you, but it definitely will.  It’ll happily take you across the entire galaxy, dodgy asteroids, swerving around slow moving freighters only to ram you into the side of the space station you’re trying to dock at.  I’ve decided this is all karma for ignoring the game and letting it play itself at times.  Save often (salvage insurance).The major criticism is that the learning curve is pretty steep.  That’s good and bad.  It’ll put off new players but means that you feel a greater sense of achievement once you finally wrestle control of that CAG script and work out what in hell it does.   Don’t judge the game until you’ve put a load of hours into it.In short, if you want a fast paced space shoot-em-up, this isn’t it.  If you love Elite-style games and want to explore a universe with some gorgeous ships, a thriving economy and a good back story, this is it.			"

												This game is not something you can casually pick up for 20 minutes. If you buy it, be prepared to commit some time to it.A true 4X game.The draw of the game is its complexitiy. Yes it has a steep learning curve and you will probably spend the first 10-15 hours wondering what the hell is going on and how can I get that gun onto my ship. It is a richly detailed, highly functioning economy simulator with many hours of plot stories/missions and an unlimited number of side quests. And unlike EVE or Elite:Dangerous, it doesn't feel like you are grinding. You start out in either a trading ship or a small combat ship. From there you can complete increasingley complicated missions such as:- Assasinate someone- Courier this person/parts/goods from A to B (but watch out for pirates)- Supply a station with xxx units of this trade good- Build a station in this location- Follow someone without being seenThe higher your respective trade or combat rank the more difficult the missions. Distances get bigger, trade orders get larger, targets get bigger guns and escorts.But, after that you can set up automated traders or stations to generate credits. While they're busy making money fly around the galaxy and discover new trade routes, hidden sectors and rare trade goods. Then buy a frigate, fit it out with some big guns and go shoot something. Collect some bounties, expand your empire.Each race manufactures its own ship for each class, with varying strengths. Low shields but fast - SplitSlow with armour - TeladiReally good but compatible with only their races weapons - TerranCompletely useless but look pretty - BoronOn another note, the developers Egosoft have a good relationship with their community and have included some player created mods into official patches. Tips-Learn how to use autopilot- Use 'J' to speed up the game while in autopilot-Aquire a jumpdrive ASAP, makes getting to known sectors an easy task.- Set up a few Universal Traders to generate income- Go view the forums at egosoft for some tutorials			"

												When it comes to open-ended games this is one of the best. You start out with just a small ship and are thrown into a universe where you can do pretty much what you want and be what you want while the universe reacts to your actions. You can follow the stories or create your own. Terran Conflict is a great expansion on the origional x3 and the new ships, missions, and Terran race with a lovely station around earth are well worth the purchase price. Given that the game has a hugely talented mod community, you will get your money's worth in this game if a challanging space sim is what you are after.			"

												This game is a bit like Euro Truck Driver 2 in space, it can be slow paced although you can speed up time, it still can take time to save up to get better ships, increase your cargo hold etc but it is relaxing and you have to be a fan of space sims.It does have a little bit of a learning curve but thanks to the sidemenu and hotkeys you pick it up rather fast.  My only gripe would be the sectors even though they might be from 50-100km big, can seem a bit sparse sometimes even though there are space stations, which later on you can buy and build your own trading stations. It would be nice if you could go off the beaten path or space highway and discover things in deep space. However this game is geared towards trading rather than exploration. Still the graphics are very nice even for an old game, aside from the NPC avatars. The draw card for me is to be able to eventually own a large fleet and manage them and have your own trading stations, there is space combat for those who want to do that and of course mining. Like any game it takes time to get to the point of being able to really start making serious money in the game which will speed up meeting your own goals in the game.There are other similar games popping up on Steam, which i think is a good think. But those are generally early alpha where has this game has been a round for quite a while and is complete. And i believe the devs are working on X4 which i hope will forge new ground in this genre. Be warned though this game can be addicting, just one more ore run can have you up late.			"

If I knew that x-rebirth would totally destroy the series by being completely horrible I should've just asked for a albion prelude 2 on this old engine. This is the end of the line for the series. Everything after albion prelude is considered a hallow lifeless body floating in space that is worshipped by shills.			"

												This is one of those games where you play it for a couple of hours then say ""I need to go to sleep/do shopping/visit family/eat"", then you forget and keep on micro-managing your fledgling empire of station complexes, fleets & such; all while doing plot missions.Pros:-Massive Universe (Not Elite:Dangerous size, but it's still huge)-Over 100+ different flyable/pilotable ships-Multiple, optional, plots and story lines-Lots of different missions-Build your own stations and complexes-Very good modding support and active modding community (even in 2016)-Good replayability value. I've put over 300+ hours into this game-Simple UI with lots of keyboard shortcuts, all of which are modifable-Script Editor, spawn your own Tyr or D*ca and lay waste to everything...that's cheating though-Game Director keeps things freshCons:-Prone to crashing late game, especially if you use Universe Traders. DON'T USE UNIVERSE TRADERS!!-Unforgiving combat and punishing play (although this isn't a massive con, it adds a challenge)-Steep learning curve to X-Series newbies (I was new to X with X3:TC, but I'm awesome at it now)-Buggy AI scripts-Game Director is silly at times. Make sure you dock a ship in every Marine Training Barracks if you want any good Marines-Sector Invasions can mean you lose entire station complexes, fleets or such if 5 Kha'ak or Xenon destroys/carriers decide to just spawn in randomly. Avoid the North East part of the Universe Map (Getsu Fune etc)-Laggy on low performance PCs, it does still run though. Just don't expect to ""like"" Terran sectors or those with lots of Nebula/gas in them-Poor rewards at the end of some quests.It is overall a decent game. 7/10, would be higher but AI and Bug issues are annoying & the Modding Community were left to fix them.

												I wanted to like this game.  The game uses an open world with a very deep level of intricate trading to draw you in, but when you get there, you begin to notice a few annoying hampers to the fun.  1) Quests are given by NPCs.  The randomly generated quests are indicated by a small icon beside the station name.  Since more than one quest can be simultaneously given and these quests are divided into types which are represented by icons, you never get a correct indication of all available quests.  This is because only one icon will be displayed while multiple quests could be generated.  If on your computer you were trying to find out your Wi-Fi signal strength and all that was shown was a Sun Java update, you'd get the feeling of this annoyance.  2) Sometimes an open ended game is a good thing.  This is not one of those times.  Many of the given quests are unaccomplishable without prerequisite hardware, and this prerequisite hardware seems so vaguely indicated, so whisperingly hinted at, that it's not possible to know -- that multiple failures are the only way outside of research out of game to discover whether you'll be able to glean your needed profits from a quest or finish it at all.  This leads you to feel as though a quest is probably going to be a discouragement rather than a step towards your goals.  Again, I cannot overstate the literal impossibility of doing some of the quests.If you can get over those qualms, and you might, you'll find an interestingly designed space-trader with a plethora of ships from drive-enabled space junk starters (we're talking PT boats here), to multiple gunned, AI piloted capitol ships which can be organized into floatillas, (we're talking the Pacific Fleet here).  Despite some unfortunately difficult hurdles, a very intelligent person with a lot of free time might have a chance at this, and the game itself has a lot of content and a lot of promise.I give it a 3/5 for Content, Concept, and Quality minus Ease and Clarity, but no reccomendation.Cross platform works well, Mac and Windows.

												X3: Terran Conflict is a space simulation game. That is its basic genre, but i like to think of it as more of a space bussiness management game. Someone else may see it as a space combat simulator. The point is you can really play this game the way you want. Many people are scared of the scale this game seems to be but as long as you start with baby steps its really alright. You don't have to be a grand adventurer exploring the entire universe battling enemy capital ships with a fleet of your own. In fact you could play without even leaving your sector if you wished to as you learn the game. I believe that everyone should at least have a go at this game even though it is a bit older.			"

												TLDR; Good game (9.5/10), be what you want, do what you want and be able to be the best at what you do, though it takes a herculean effort to do so.   This is my single favorite game in my game library. I got this game recommended to me by one of my friends and back then I wasn't a fan of simulator games and unfamiliar with space games.  I started this game not knowing what to do, even with some newbie help from my friend. After that, the manual was (barring a few errors) pretty helpful, but even then doesn't apply to even a quarter of the game. the game has a steep (massive) learning curve, combined with the vast amount of time you have to spend in game to actually become a sizeable entity makes this the most rewarding game I have ever played. I haven't bothered much with it's sequel (X-Rebirth) or it's brothers of the same era (X3-Reunion & X3-Albion prelude), but I can tell you this game is worth it, though I can't possibly tell you which is better.  The game isn't without flaws though, for starters the auto pilot or auto 'pilok' as it is often referred to, because it is notorious for crashing your ship into rocks, other ships or sector gates. While for me this is extremely rare, it does happen. Also, this game has a GOD. GOD is actually part of the game engine and calculates which factories do not produce (enough) profit and deletes these, potentially risking important factories of rare weapons to disappear. While most (if not all) factories can be built yourself, some factories need to be unlocked by getting further into the game, but this problem is certainly not insurmountable.  Right now I don't have any more negative things to comment on this game, the things mentioned above being my biggest ''issues'' with this game. I say ""issues"", because they can be easily overcome with some effort on your own part.  I hope you enjoy this game as much as I still do. 9,5/10, best game in my library			"

Start off small, and slowly build up and have the space conglomerate/navy you've always wanted!			"

												I would love to recommend this game, I really would, but I just can't. The game is awesome and has a TON of potential, but it is rife with bugs that render the game basically unplayable. Namely the ship autopilot that you basically have to use when under time warp, but it randomly sends you crashing into other sips, asteroids, or even jump gates, so unless you save every couple of minutes you end up losing hours of progress, over and over and over, mining ships constantly destroy themselves as well.The game feels unfinished, there are text entry boxes that are crooked, I mean really... c'mon.If you are on linux DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! Egosoft did NOT do the linux port, they had an outside company do it, and said company is nolonger in business. Egosoft directs ALL linux support to this outside company that nolonger exists, they do not support it themselves as they cannot, so if you have an issue under linux you are SOL.Bottom line is the game is basically unfinished and has game breaking bugs, if they were to spend another month or two and release an update patch to remedy the glaring issues I would recommend it, if you are on windows.

												More X-Goodness.Looks and plays great.New players will find X3TC very easy to get into because of the tutorial missions.However, experienced X-gamers will feel ahead of the class.Mission icons are added for easily finding missions.Good if you want it... but bad if you don't as it makes you feel like it's holding your hand.Missions are now given by NPCs that can be found on stations or flying their ships.Good because it makes those ships that flew around before have more importance.But bad because they removed the BBS to do it.Which means no browsing the news articles while docked, no missions from a bulletin board, no blackjack, no lottery...So, while the graphics continue getting improved with each incarnation of X, it seems like there's a limit to the actual features they implement. And when they add something, they remove something else.However, it's still highly recommended because those things you miss from the older games can be put back in by editing the game yourself or finding a script or mod already created at the official forums.So... I give X3TC 4 out of 5 stars 'as is'.But if they could keep all the features from the past games it would be a 10 out of 5.The mod community may compensate, however.			"

												I must've spent already around 2000 hours on this game, considering I already had it quite some time before registering it on steam. The depth of the X-Universe in terms of exploring is incomparable to any other game I know and it's part of what makes this game so awesome. The background story is also really really deep, with several books out there adding to the universe.It does have some bugs and boring things (which game doesn't?), but someone who's willing to spend time on this game will eventually learn where he belongs in this universe, and there you can (mostly) avoid those bugs and boring missions. That being said, I have never had any all too big problems with bugs, and the insane depth this game offers makes up for all hardship along the way.It's a game I can only recommend to try out, though be warned, the true gems of this game won't show up until a few hundred hours of playing.

												I tried for years to like this game, then tried again, then I got X Rebirth, got hooked, I loved it, and finally I understood how to play X3. I played through X3 Reunion, then went on to this. Not sure if the recent patch has improved a lot or it's just that I sucked before, but this game is amazing. It's got everything that I was missing in X Rebirth. It's an amazing feeling to detach from a station and just hover off into the vast aquarium world, with a dozen ships to order around, earning you tons of money so you can buy better and cooler ships and weapons, and more minions to earn you even more money.All the things that made me happy in Rebirth and a lot more, not as flashy, but without the bugs and you can steer all the ships.

												Incredible game with a large learning curve. I Have hundreds of hours in the X games and this is the last good one before the flop that was rebirth. If you are interested in the series I recommend starting at x3 either the original game if you're super keen or TC if you just want the best experience. X1 and X2 are pretty much the same game.I would essentially describe this game as EVE single player. It allows you to acomplish all you can in the MMO all on your lonesome. You can do the missions to get started but the main reason to play the game is the sandbox. Modded up the scale of the game is HUGE and you need to keep seperate records of your fleets objectives and traders comings and goings in order to keep up with it all. After playing full time for several weeks I managed to have my own space station and fleet of automated trading ships that constantly made money for me. I could mostly let them roam the galaxy trading away but had to occasionally fly off to sort out troubled systems. I build a huge fleet to assault another faction but ended up losing the fight.Do not buy if a few bugs or a steep learning curve bother you, this game doesn't really hold your hand.  "

												Terran Conflict was a game I went into without watching any tutorials. That was the biggest mistake I made with the game. This game may be one of the most complex games I've ever played, the depth is superb. You can be a trader, a pirate, the world is yours to play with. a huge universe so expansive it feels like your actually in space. This game is the true space sandbox. If you want to have a great simulation of space trading, or space piracy, or space combat, IMO this game is for you			"

												   I had never played any of the other games in this series, so I had no idea what I was getting into when I got this game, but I am glad I did. Yes, just like most of the other reviews I will say there is quite a bit to learn. I recommend looking at the guides avaliable (the X3 for Dummies guide helped me get a clue what was going on, while another guide taught me to salvage missles for early game income) the in-game ""Flight School"" isn't as helpful as i'm sure it was intended to be.    You start out at the very bottom of the bottom for ships and equipment and information on your surroundings which while for some this may be annoying, I personally found it makes progression feel that much more rewarding. Trading in that old Mercury for a Mistral Super Freighter was very sweet.   The music is rather mellow but fitting. Sound is decent, all the various beeps and zaps one would expect in a space sim. The voices are not terrible but not really very good either. Mostly you will hear the robotic female voice telling you the name of whatever you have just clicked on or various facts about said things, which is fine.   I have not experienced a lot of the fight system, being a humble yet cautious trader leads to following a lot of fighting around but not actually participating in it. That said even the small skirmishes are impressive to behold, there are a lot of different colored lasers and many different types of missile weapons all with various uses and effects I am sure.   The only notably terrible thing in the game is the auto-pilot which will at times crash you directly into things such as Gate frames or other ships. This can lead to your instant death if you hit something large enough or fast enough or if you're unlucky enough to survive hitting a military ship, war with an entire race. Embrace the save scumming unless you want to end up with your new suped up Split Elephant ramming into a fleet of the Argon Police force just because you forgot to leave the sector before telling its auto-pilot to place that Cahoona Bakery near Argon Prime, now you're roughly 20+ million credits down and at war with your own people. Despite this if you're careful with your own ship and not present in a sector while giving commands to the AI, it's an easily dismissable downside.   All in all I would say this is a good game if you:1. Have a lot of time on your hands to play intense and involved space sims and enjoy doing so2. Are patient with learning new things3. Don't trust auto-pilots4. Profit!			"

												Played this for years, eventually got it on Steam.X3 Terran Conflict is like Reunion - a niche game which you will fall in love with and pour hours into or dump immediately. Both responses are understandable. Generally speaking, it's matured well, the controls make sense, it still has the pretty visuals and its deep. Bugs are minimal by now, and it runs well on most machines too. Worth buying, but cheap enough that you won't miss rent because you decided to sample it.			"

Posted: January 15, 2015
												A fanatic in games related to anything space, I find myself blown away by X3: Terran Conflict and the amount of sheer possibilities this game offers. I have searched and played a wide vareity of space strategy, arcade combat and simulator games over the past 20 years and X3 is by far one of the richest and well made games I have ever played to date. Its beautiful, ruthless and endlessly vast. To start, I will say that this is a very deep and heavy space simulator. You will spend more time setting up keys and shortcuts aswell as getting used to the interface and HUD before actually trading and fighting. That being said, once you have your keys set up and got comfortable you can easily start highlighting other ships and taking on missions. Whether those are escort, enemy take out, trading, rescue, scouting...the list goes on or just plain messing around in space it will leave you busy not for hours, but days, months, even years.The Terran story is the easiest to get into as you start at Uranus, neptune, pluto, mars and then out to the alien sectors. During those missions (3 main story missions or 2-3 hours into it) you start to get ships as gifts to either sell for money and then use to upgrade others given to you. This is a perfect example of how the game plays out, it takes a bit of time learning what to do and where to go but once you start chipping away at the surface you learn more and get more. The game snow balls the learning experience always teaching you something new once you get new ships or get to new areas but then opening up even more doors to things you did or didn't do before you can now do better or differently.As it may take you a little while to learn the ropes, you start to realize if you want to avoid the main story entirely you can. You soon discover you can be a pirate and steal your own ships and make your own evil empire, be a master trader and send automated convoys throughout the 200+ sectors in the universe and have your own military escorts. Be your own military (well for the leading race you are with).Graphics! Oh my the Graphics. It was released in 2008 and this game has aged well! When it was first released it was a monster of a game to run on PCs. Even low graphic settings it looked good but required alot, but with todays tech for PCs 7 years later this game can be easily pushed to high on mid end gaming pcs and can be maxed effortlessly with your average PC for games today. And when it is its breatless. The detail and scope of the game is mammoth, everything is so complex and intricate. A small space station in the distance can become a hulking megafort. Docking alone is a treat as you see upclose the details and raw size of the game. A true work of digital engineering mastery!!!The final conclusion is that it plays like anything you want it to be, even to go so far and say mid to late game it can be a strategy game in the same vein of civilisation, but at the drop of a dime become star wars and rock your world. I bought a few other games on ps4 recently and thought I would be playing those... yea forget those games.The gameplay, graphics, open world, the story, the polish and loving patches made to fix the bugs. It deserves a 10/10 and rightfully so.Warning : If you intend on flying small fighters all the time and have epic space dog fights then tune your mouse skills up or get a gamepad/ joystick. You can buy Autopilot upgrades for combat early on but anytime you are in a mid to heavy fighter and they are in a light scout fighter you will go in circles shooting like crazy if you don't have a joystick or have your mouse sensitivity maxed. You can fly classic without those too, you just switch alot between auto pilot and manual fire mode. All that being said, its minor and is for early game. Once you get given your first few ships, you can simply have them follow you and intercept anyone while you pick and chose your targets.   "

												X3TC is a great game! I really like it allot! In short the X3TC game loads, runs fast and saves can be performed only while at a space station. (yes there are exceptions)  My computer is i7 Intel processor with 4 G RAM running Windows 7 /32 bit. The X3TC software has been error free at my playing hours point into the game.  I hope there is a way to back up very long playing periods. The X universe is a very big place. The game starts off slow, requires the player to read the manual. Once you learn to get around the keyboard short cuts moves the game along fast as you expand your ship equipment.Below if your lost in X3TC I have learn quite abit on how to play X3TC on this gentlemens excellent YouTubes.T/C and have Fun!rg-----------------8><--------------- This will be a video tutorial series that should be a complete walkthrough for new players of X3TC. The plan is to take a player from starting a new game to developing an economy that produces a good income (through trading, stations, and local/universal traders) and being able to defend those assets through combat skills / obtaining and equipping combat ships. Let me know if I present something that is incorrect or if there is a much better way of doing things. I hope this will help new players to X3TC.

												So what can I say about X3TC, well lets talk about its pros and cons first. Pros,1. I have put in 100 plus hours and I barly got one of the cheapest M2's in the game and for those of you who don't know what an M2 is its basicly the factions strongest war ship and the argon titan that I have is very cheap.2. There are many ways to make money in this game from becoming a mining corporation, a trading corporation, and/or (Yes I did just say and/or are you interested yet) an assassin. 3. Lastly most of the plots especially the hub which i'm working on are extremly difficult and cost 100's of millions of credits to finish giving you a good challange and even more of a reason to play longer.Now here are the Cons of the game.Cons,1, Now this game has a freakin massive learning curve. It took me about 2 hours to even figure out what I was doing, and that my starting ship really sucked. If it wasn't for one of my friends I wouldn't have ever liked this game. If you don't know what your doing check the forums or ask a question there everyone there is very helpfull. 2, Now this kind of collides with pro 3 because some of the mission do get a little tedius but when your combat rank goes up so does the difficulty. At the point i'm at i'm getting in awesome broadside battles with other capital ships and waging war on the xenon (a hostile robotic race bent on destroying all known life). 3, I forgot to add this and it kind of combines with con 1 but this game is really does not explain anything to you. I had to restart my game because I started on a custom game and you can't do the plots in custom game. Thank you for reading this review and at first you will probobly hate this game but just endure the starting parts and everything will eventually come together for the better.			"

												This gorgeous looking game sometimes makes me wish I hadn't given up getting stoned. Can't imagine a better game to go with a bag of weed. Its actually a great game. Unless I'm missing something again I can't see why it has as many negative reviews, but the autopilot definitely has a lot to answer for ...$1 from humble bundle, so keep your eye out on humble bundle, bundle-stars or for steam sales.Still pretty good stone-cold-sober but it has a big learning curve, that seems even bigger than it really is so I recommend that you need to look at the guides and as many tutorials as you can before getting this, rather than trying to figure it all out yourself afterwards, or it gets very frustrating.On the encouraging side, 90% of the stuff in the tutorials isn't needed to get you started.Verdict: well worth it if you can pick it up in a sale or bundle, and another Steam space-sim with a nice community.

												This was one of those games where i bought it, played it for a few minutes and left it to rot in my steam library. After playing FTL for a bit i decided to give it another go. Its a very immersive sandbox game with alot of things to do. You can captain a huge capital ship and blow pirates and other factions to bits, or you can build stations and run the universe with your economy like a true capitalist. There are missions to do which can vary from blowing some guy up to building a station or even being a taxi. The universe is fairly large with around 240+ sectors so theres alot to explore. Diffrent sectors belong to diffrent factions with have their own ships (I like argons ships) You can buy their ships once you have enough reputation with them. There can also be pirates which can be annoying early game but trust me. Its satisfying to assult their pirate base with 3 captial ships as revenge. It can take a while to get into this game as it did with me, i just had to sit down and use google every time i needed help. The community is great for tutorials and guides as they can help you out with pretty much any questions you have about this game. 10/10 Autopilot crashed me into a station.			"

												This is the best I've seen in an open world (galaxy really) space simulator that is detailed and micromanaged to the extreme. This is not an easy game to just jump into. Once you learn how to make money (and get your ships upgraded to do automatic trading, you can then focus on building your fleet of ships, to trade, explore, build, and conquer.But this game, as I said, is not easy. When flying, your auto-pilot can collide you into an asteroid, or a space station, or another ship. You only can fly so fast, so auto-pilot is a must. But you still must be there to take control should you need to dodge something. If you don't upgrade your ships with the most powerful lasers, missles, and have proper shields, and you get into a fight. Expect to be destroyed. You can only save your game when docked in a station, but you can buy SALVAGE INSURANCE to save any where. It's a graphically pleasing game and the music is mellow. Play this for the journey and the attempted realism.			"

												This game has a very steep learning curve. I highly recommend watching about 30 minutes of youtube toturials to get the basics of the game down. If you have the time to learn and build up some cash, it gets to be pretty fun. I have only made it a little ways into the game, but it has a huge amount of detail in ecomony and combat. It also has a rich amount of factions and building up your rank with them. I have enjoyed playing and look forward to getting into the story of it. I highly recommend only if you enjoy sinking hours into a economy based space sim.			"

At this point it becomes a fleet managment game and jumping a fleet becomes tedious.- No end goal and enemies just respawn.- Crashing into astroids/AI, it will happen a lot!The amount of things you can do and the massive campaign means that it will be hundreds of hour before you see the negatives I listed, just exploring and trying new ships will takes hours and hours as the map is so huge. For me the positives far outweigh the negatives.I also recommend a joystick for flying.			"

												The best way to describe the flavor of this game is bittersweet. This game has a tremendously huge learning curve. This learning curve makes the easier missions almost seem monotonous. However, after a few how-to videos on different ship classes and what some of the sub-systems do and how trading works, I found that this game becomes rather enjoyable. The graphics are rather nice and the dogfights can be rather intuitive, depending on what enemy ships the game decides to dish out on the missions making a player decide whether or not they are going fight or retreat. I must also say that some of the autopiloting scripts are also broken as I have had problems running into other ships while taxiing from one transorbital gate to another. The best feature I like about this titile is that it's pretty much play at your pace. You are allowed to do the story missions first or, if you want, you can buy/sale goods or you can do both at the same time.			"

												X3 Terran Conflict is an open universe sandbox space game. With a huge explorable universe, a complex economy,  a huge variety of ships, that each have their own use, a nice backstory, decent graphics and music that lets you do what you want, when you want, however you want.I highly recommned this older game!

												X3TC, for all you former EVE players that want basically a PvE version of Eve, this fits the bill nicely. I personally spent two years playing EVE and stopped back in 2013 as it took too much time. A few things are different, however it has a good size scope and has alot of tasks / things to do within the universe. Trade, build, fight, explore, etc. For those not familiar with EVE, this is a good space theme game that's a big sandbox, Steep learning curve. As with EVE, there is no real direction to go at first. You have to find your way about. Recommdation for anyone who hasn't played to watch a few youtube videos and read a few posts on the forums, etc. I've only played 15-20 hours (some offline) and have barely scratched the surface. Just mapping out the universe is time consuming. I can see that I'll be playing this one for a while.			"

												Sandbox space sim. Don't play it for the story or the writing. Play it if you like space sims and/or trading empire games or anything space in general. Play a few hours to get the hang of it then go to the Egosoft forums and mod the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of your game. The mods make this game complete. Inject all your favorite space ships ever into this game. Make factory complexes, buy and sell resources, mine by hand or using vast mining complexes. Engage in giant space battles against hundreds of other ships. Definately the best space sim game out currently as of 12/4/2013. Don't buy X:Rebirth yet until the community can fix what the developers did.			"

												If you're looking for an open universe space game that lets you do what you want, this is it. However, if you're somebody that doesn't have the patience to learn practically everything by yourself, I would stray away. I took on the infamous ""learning curve"" this game has and I'm glad I did. I didn't think learning a game could actually frustrate me, but when I did learn, I started to have a lot of fun. There are very few space sandbox games that let you have this amount of control.What little of a tutorial this game has makes up for it in variety and content. You can approach success in space by trading or by working for the military. You'll start out with a small spacecraft with hardly any weaponry or cargo space and are set in a galaxy with many avenues of approach. Your only obstacle is your ambition. 6 hours later of learning and I now have 3 trading ships in my fleet, including two extra large tankers which I use to transport energy cells from solar power facilities to space stations that need them. Almost every sector without a solar power facility needs these cells to operate and is a quick way to gain a fortune to expand your fleet and your success in being a merchant.As mentioned earlier, you can also progress by working for the military or being a mercenary. The game starts you out with very little direction for this, but eventually you will find there is plenty of work to be done in the form of stations and military outposts looking for people to hire. Completing these jobs will earn you recoignition for your status as well as credits to spend on your ship or fleet.In the end you don't have to do any of this, you are free to explore where ever you like as far as you like, attack anybody you want, trade with anybody you want, settle with any species you want. And I'm promised that's not the end of it. I'm very excited to really dig into this game on a day I don't have to work, I look forward to the expansions of everyones space empire, should they choose to purchase this game.			"

												Ill just keep this short.The game is amazing on its own, but with mods you will lose the time you need to live your life...Pro's:- As real as you can get to a living breathing universe- Complete freedom to do whatever you want. Go play with nukes till you are bored or build a trading empire just to see if you can become so rich that you can buy everyhting in the game. the possibilities are endless.- No crashes for me or even slow play after 500+ hour game.- Truly massive scale!- Even playable without Steam! (download .exe from developer website)- Many more but im a lazy person so screw it.Con's:- Not big on story, you need to make your own.- Learning curve at the start, yes attacking a destroyer with a fighter gets you scrapped faster then you can say oh.. thats big.. and getting to know the game takes a bit of time. Although i was already frakking pirates and making a bit of money after 10 min.			"

												This is a good example of needing a third option between recommend and not recommending.Everything in this game I should like, the exploration, the building an empire, and space combat. I can easily see someone sinking hundreds of hours into this game. Why haven't I then? Because it's boring as ♥♥♥♥.If you want a near realistic space sim, this is for you. Space is filled with a lot of nothing and there's a lot of nothing to do while flying between two destinations. I gave up on this game when I realized that I wanted the built in time speed increasing device to go FASTER than the maxium setting of (I think) 100x normal speed. The game gives you a built in mechanic to speed things up. I think that should be enough to say what's happening in this game.On the flip side, if you're doing something else and have this running in the background and look in on it now and again, this might be right up your alley. The game has massive potential, it's a shame I can't get past the slow pace of it to enjoy it.This is definitely a maybe game.			"

												Graphics may not be cutting edge, but you won't even notice.  Everything looks fantastic, especially with a certain mod installed that rebalances the entire game and adds a ton of stuff. The sound is ... well, it's spacey.  The ships make cool ship sounds, the weapons sound good.. kinda like weapons.  The music I really love, ambient and beautiful, usualy.  But action packed when you stir♥♥♥♥♥♥up.The gameplay is great - but do yourself a favor and install the mod I mention below, it adds a great deal of content and forces you to strategize a bit.. it makes the universe a lot more dangerous, too.I can't recommend this game enough.  It's not nearly as hard to get into as people make it sound.  They're just being complainy and have that disorder that is the reason why commercials and movies have to  flash to a different scene every 5 seconds and use bright colors to keep the viewers from wandering aimlessly away from the TV and off a cliff or something stupid like that without realizing what they're doing..  You know, that's goldfish level attention span.... just saying.  I guess what I mean is, they're only the big HALO and COD fans. And they suck, right?I installed the XRM mod... adds a whole lot more to an already massive game.  Very good.  Makes a lot more random and dangerous encounters with different factions. - I worked my way up till I hadl ike 9 trade ships and I did a few taxi missions and then i started buying fighters...  then I bought a couple of these little military transports (like a small carrier.. holds 4 ships and has a couple turrets... im no superpower ...yet) and I had the most awesome battle.  I jumped into some sector because I wanted to buy a bunch of missiles for my fighters and I ran into 2 of these Xenon corvettes and a few fighter's with them.   It turned into a big flashy battle and I completely mopped the floor with the bastages.   Even though I didn't have anything as big as a corvette myself, I deployed all my fighters and got into my Eclipse prototype ship and shot them all down.  In the end, the fighter I was flying was the only one that got really badly damaged and I didn't even lose one ship...  a little repairing to do, but hey... that was one of the most badass video game moments I've had in a very long time.  Even the early stages of my character where I was trading and playing the taxi driver (you can do anything you want... though) I was having a lot of fun.  I was looking for new sectors to trade in and new goods and I came across a sector called The Vault, and there was a Khaak destroyer and two frigates and they destroyed pretty much everything in the sector.. ultimately I had to run but I watched them take down wave after wave of defenses but they pretty much destroyed every station in that entire sector...  that = sweet.Buy this game... play this game...  it's so good I actually♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants, really.  And that's just when I think about playing it.. when I actually play... wow.   Do yourself a favor and download the amazing XRM mod, it adds so much depth and replayability, not that the game didn't already have this... but who doesn't like even more weapons, ships, customization, strategy and battles?  Pansies, that's who.  Are you a pansy?   Play the damn game.			"

												I think you need only see my hours played for my opinion of this game. It took a huge effort by the community and devs to fix a great deal of issues at the start, but I've got to say this will remain in my favourite games list forever. Its a mindnumbingly difficult game to wrap your head around at first, but when you do you'll be rewarded with a damn good, persistent economic management sim alongside a beautiful space simulator (with plenty of dogfighting). It took months (partially due to a break, and partially due to a missing save (my fault completely) to get myself up to the point I got my first Carrier-class ship, and it was a beautiful moment watching a full fighter wing swarm and destroy another capital. The best selling point being you can sit back in your mammoth of a ship, or join the fight in a fighter (and these can be anything from nippy scouts, to heavy damage-soakers (and that's still not mentioning the myriad of Escort-class ships that bridge the gap between fighters and capitals.) Basically, if it flies, you can fly it.It is prohibitively slow at first, guides can help with this, and I seriously recommend modding in the late game, both for added features, and tweaking the game to suit you better (easier/harder combat, more enemy ships/greater frequency of huge ships) anyway I could go on, but I can guarantee if the above sounds like your sort of thing you'll get your money's worth and then some.

												One of the biggest brothers in the trading and economic simulation genres, X3 Terran Conflict is, in my opinion, the go-to-game in the series over the vanilla X3 and Albion Prelude flavors (this is being written prior to the release of Reuinion). X3 is a game that will worm its way into the hearts of those who enjoy the RPG mechanic of starting out small and building yourself up. No green slimes will be slain, though. In this game you'll be starting out in a modest little space fighter or freighter and working your way into power and prosperity through combat, trade, or a mix of the two (salvaging gear from the strife of others). While combat was fun, and shouldn't dissapoint anyone coming from the Freespace school of gaming, I found trading and fleet management to be the most enjoyable and challenging parts of the game. X3's logistics, economy, and trading mechanics are as complex as they are fun, and a wonderful reward for those willing to brave the learning curve.			"

												This game is freaking huge; it has the kind of scope and scale that you very rarely see in any game. You are given the option to effectively start with the space equivelent of a backpack and a shed, from which you can work your way up to owning an enormous fleet (and when i say enormous, i mean both numerous ships AND proportionally vast construction - there are ships so large they can't actually dock with any stations because they'd crush it!) entire sectors of space filled with your supply stations and factories, able to smash entire sectors into submission with brute force or starve them into poverty with strategic cordons of ships to block trade routes.HOWEVER - This. All. Takes. Time. Alot of time! Be warned: if you choose the slowest start it could be a good 30hours or so before you can even afford to buy another ship. This is not a game you can just dip into for five minutes - it needs focus and attention, but I for one think the time is worth it :)			"

The depth to this game is amazing, and it will require some actual planning and strategy to build wealth and power.On the downside, starting as a new play is very intimidating.  There is very little in-game explanation of anything, and you have to learn a TON by trial and error.  On the upside, X3TC has a rich community and tons of resources in their forum.  I've spent a surprising amount of time outside of the game researching and planning what I'm going to buy and build.Great game, and you'll get a lot for your money, but you'll have to enjoy games with a long arc which require a lot of strategic planning - so it won't be for everyone.

												This negative review is regrettable.  I had high hopes that this game was going to be a fun and interactive experience.  However, this game is an excercise in frustration for me.Don't get me wrong, I can understand why some people would really like it.I suppose, I'll do the typical pros versus cons style review and let you make your judgement.ProsDepth:  This game has so much depth and a real sense of immersion.  With innumerable ways to play.Customization:  Each ship's weapon loadout is customizable.Expansive:  Every system you enter is huge with many places to visit.  Players can even build their own space stations.ConsThis game does not respect your time:  Every system takes 5-10m to cross, with little-to-no interaction.  When you die, you are sent all the way out to the main menu to reload your save game, instead of given the option in-game.  Docking with stations takes 5-10m.  In six hours of gameplay, I have made little progress in any of my endeavors.  And, the smallest inkling of satisfaction for the time invested.The jump-drive is terrible:  This 'jump-drive,' accelerates time, but the ship must be on auto-pilot or it cannot make any maneuvers.In-game options:  The in-game options reset themselves for every new game you start.Long, useless tutorial:  The tutorial alone requires approximately 20m to complete and only teaches you basic flight controls.  Leaving the player to 'experiment' to figure out everything else.EXTREMELY steep learning curve: In the six hours I have played of this game, I have made little progress in understanding the economy and I am still finding new ship controls.Overall, I'm glad I bought this game on sale instead of paying full price.  However, I wish I could return it.			"

												Surprisingly fun, surprising hard as nails. It'll take a bit to get into to, but once you get the hotkeys down the game really opens up. If it's on sale, pick it up and give it a shot. Don't give up on it right away, play around for the first hour or two, watch a tut on youtube because it's worth it.			"

												By the time of writing 70 hours and absolutely love this game so far! A big open world space simulator with absolute freedom to go wherever you want and do whatever you want. This game isn't for everyone though. There's a steep learning curve and you have to be patient because you start with nothing but a ship. I chose the merchant's path. Built my first two stations and have around 15 ships. Now it's just my trading empire I need :)			"

												A very challenging game at first. In the beginning, you will have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT TO DO. That's what the internet is here for. Look up a tutorial, or ask a friend for some help. Once you get going, its a real fun game. I would suggest following the terran storyline first off, I never finished it. But doing it gives you some combat time, and it really helps you learn the basics.			"

												If you enjoy space sims and have the patience to get over the slower pace of the game and the high learning curve, I'd recommend giving X³ Terran Conflict a try. The sheer depth of simulation makes the game's universe truly come alive, from a dynamic supply/demand economy to factional wars being raged as you play, all simulated and not scripted. Be warned though, this game can be a real time-sink. I'm writing this review 20+ hours in and I feel like I've just scratched the surface.			"

												Not sure why it's taken me this long to put up a recommendation for this on Steam - especially since I essentially got three people to buy it because of me repeatedly telling them they should; followed by them enjoying the game - but oh well, I'll do one now, I guess!Anyway, if you've ever played a space sim (Freelancer's the main one that comes to mind) from years past, and would very much like more of that type of high-quality type of simulation, then look no further! Egosoft has done a very good job of making a (sometimes brutal) space simulation game where you can essentially do what you want in the universe; from being a mercenary fighting for those who pay well, to a trader seeking out the best deals, to a space station owner churning out resources for others to buy, to any and all of the above! (even more, really)X3: Terran Conflict really is a very good game, and one that you'll most certainly sink many hours into, providing you've got a joystick and are willing to learn.			"

												Not only is X strictly singleplayer (and hopefully staying that way forevermore), the community actually helps newcomers to the X Universe. They're one of the most mature gaming communities I've ever encountered. I thought those sorts of fanbases were a thing of the past, but the Egosoft forums (before the massive influx of newbies from X Rebirth came along) has proven me delightfully wrong.But, heh, back to reviewing the game itself. It's a space-sim. Trade, build, think, fight. Yes, think. It actually requires a brain unlike most games out there. Oh and the mod support, hell yes. If you have trouble, and as long as you're willing to, y'know, think for yourself, most everyone in the Egosoft modding forums are eager to assist.If you like games such as Sim City, then you'll still love the X series. I suppose you could call it Space Trading Empire Tycoon meets Wing Commander, but the entire series is much more than that.			"

												The X series has been around for quite a while and with each iteration the scope and depth and quality has expanded. This however is not a pick up and play for 5 minutes kind of game. There is a vast universe to explore with multiple different races trading and fighting for control. You start out small just one ship among the many, but that is just the start. Trade, Fight, Capture Ships, Discover. Gain credits. Buy Ships. Upgrade. Build space factories. RULE THE UNIVERSE...eventually. like i said it all takes time, and death is always just in the next sector.			"

												Super DEEP space sim, similar to the old Wing Commander Privateer, but with you controlling more than just your own ship.  While the game is obscure to just jump into, there are a number of great online video tutorials that can help you get started.  If you like SIM games (not just 4X games), this is definitely worth a try.			"

												Looking for an in-depth space sim where you'll spend hundreds, if not thousands of hours of your life on?  This game is for you.With tons of systems to explore, which are very lively and as well as unpredictable, you can decide what you want to become.  Would you want to be a hardcore space fighter destroying anything you see fit, or would you want to take the long simple route of starting your own trade empire, or you can do both.There are several main story campaigns as well, some that are extremely long and/or challenging, but finishing each of them can be very rewarding.  But since you can start doing those anytime, you'll probably be spending most of your time exploring and building up your trade empire first. :3			"

												I must admit, I was somewhat hestiant about whether or not I could recommend this game to others. Not for a lack of quality, but because I cannot say with any degree of certainty that the average gamer will enjoy this experience. If you are the sort of person looking to find a fast-paced, action-filled shooter, then this may not be the game for you. If, however, you are one who is truly passionate for incredibly immersive space simulators, and are willing to spend the time getting to know and unveiling the true beauty of the game, then Terran Conflict is for you. One of the greatest things about this game is how alive the universe truly feels. The hundreds of unique vessels you encounter throughout your travels are all part of a vast economic network comprised of several alien civilizations that span countless sectors. Your actions as you traverse this space will create tangible effects, thus making the construction of your interstellar empire immensly satisfying.			"

With a huge, sprawling universe filled with various races and factions, and the ability to fly any ship, build any station, and automate all of this there is almost never a shortage of anything to do. On top of this, there is tremendous mod support, leading to hundreds of community mods, including a whole universe rewrite (new sectors, tens of new ships with improved graphics and effects, and a lot more).

												I really enjoy X3TC and I'll try to explain why:X3TC is a massive game. There are 10 different races, which have 13 different ship classes, which have more than 100 different factories! There is a massive amount of weapons to chose from. There is diplomacy, piracy, illegal goods, asteroid mining, an economy of supply and demand and corporate armys. I've played roughly 280hours and I haven't finished all of the available quests and plots. It's totally up to you, what you want to be in this game: you don't HAVE to fight, nor do you have to be a CEO, to sucessfully finish the game. It's totally up to you and this really does add to the replayability. This may be why it's still so much fun!There's just endless stuff to do. I'm still all over the Wiki and egosofts page, looking stuff up. The learning curve may be a little steep, but it's definitely no EVE Online!Even though Steam Workshop is not implemented in this game, there still are heaps of mods for the game out there, on the developers web page and their forum. The community of X3TC is amazing and has created a massive amount of extra content for the game, even adding completely new content, ships, ect. There are also heaps of minor modifications which improve the gameplay. I have played around 270hours vanilla client: the game works just fine without mods!For those of you interested in combat, yes it's possible and it's more than just point and click. It's actually quite hard and you will die a lot, until you have a proper ship, and even then, it may not be so easy afterall. There is a lot of tactical depth to the game, as you can command different squads of smaller fighters, while you're in your capital ship, watching the scene and giving orders. Guns shoot in specific directions, so look out for angles where it can't shoot you. The battles are beautiful and especially the battles of larger ships never sease to amaze me! You may take over other ships, take their equipment and sell the rest. You may pirate merchants, steal their cargo and sell it. You may also place your orders and just watch the amazing scenes of destruction around you. There are endless possibilities of weaponry and ships of choice: there is no ""best ship"" with the ""best equipment"", you'll have to figure out which one works best in the situation you're in. There are however general guides on which set up works well, so you can get some kind of guideline to go by.Yes, there are many different screens and menus to click through, but they're pretty much straight forward and mostly for giving orders to your own and other ships, or buying stuff. Most of the games menus can be accessed through shortcuts, so if you use those, it's not so much menu-clicking afterall! I recommend giving it a try, because you'll see that the menus usually deal with the stuff that would take ages, if you had to do it yourself, so really they give you time to roam freely!A couple of sentences to those of you interested in trading and setting up a business! The very basics are: buy low, sell high. Place good investments and meet demands that aren't being met yet. There are automatic traders which you can order at some point. There are also other fellow traders out there, looking for a good deal too, so they might just beat you to it! Sooner or later, you'll have enough money to buy your own factories/mines and maybe even set up a whole business that refines your resources into more valuable goods for a better profit margin. You'll have to organise everything from the cargoships supplying any required resources to the price you want your product to be placed at. For an even higher profit margin, you can organise a merchant to sell your own products to the highest bidder. The economy is incredibly well made, in a way that you can actually flood a market and cause prices to drop, as well as increasing prices by withdrawing, like pirating the freighters of your fellow businessmen. But don't worry, there are enough possibilities for obtaining a reasonable profit, yet money is definitely not thrown at you.This game is ""old"", yes and there doesn't seem a lot of people about, still playing it. Why do I still enjoy it? First of all, the graphics are incredibly good, for a 2008 game and it's still looking very good for todays standards. It's no Crysis and for the shame of egosoft, I personally think it looks better than X:Rebirth, which I, at this point, do not recommend buying!  One last thing you should know about X3TC: it's a slow game. Your most used key will probably be ""J"", as that speeds up time, otherwise travelling and lots of other things may be very frustrating. The distances are immense and as I said, but it's no endless travelling and waiting. But watching X3TC gameplay videos may be very dull, depending on the player. That may lead to a wrong impression of the game, because it's definitely busier than, for instance, Civ5.If you want to try out the X Series, try Terran Conflict, or X:Albion Prelude. They're both older games, essentially the same with minor differences, but they still look good and give you hours of gameplay. I'd personally recommend X3TC, since I find the stock market in X3AP to be game breakingly easy, at supplying you with large amounts of cash. But that's just my humble opinion!X3TC is one of the few games that don't get too much attention, sadly. It's a great game and I've had many hours of fun and there's still more to come! Even after months of a break, I recently bought Skyrim, I came back to it. For me, that's a sign of a properly good game. If you've read this far, I suggest you giving it a try. As I said, the game is massive and it's difficult to provide an overview of a game of this scale!			"

												X3TC, the best game out in the X series to date, is, in short, EVE Online without the hassles of player interaction. The economy is complex, the graphics beautiful, and the combat testing. The story is neither a strong point nor a weak one. Simply put, it's not very important; as someone once said, ""the story is not why you play an X game"".Its major shortcoming is, in my opinion, performance-related. Once there are enough objects in the world, the game becomes very sluggish, far beyond what I expected the performance drop to be on a machine with my specs.			"

												A severely under rated space sim that is completely open ended. If you enjoy starting from scratch and ending in greatness and enjoy micromanagment, this is the space sim for you. There are also nice little short cuts that are hidden if you feel the need for a boost.			"

												I recommend this game... but not for everyone.I would recommend this game to any fan of the space-sim genre (who has a LOT of time on their hands and is willing to learn) BUT... buyer beware, there are some major flaws (I will ellaborate) and it is almost a necessity to mod the game to make it accessible and playable.There is a MASSIVE learning curve (anyone who says otherwise is talking *&%$), I am about 200 hours into my first playthrough and I feel like I have barely scratched the surface of what you can actually do in this game. Any game with an instruction manual that is over 100 pages long is going to require some serious patience. I even found EvE-Online more accessible than X3TC. Some people will find these to be plus points but for those who want a game they can just pick up and play... buy something else. Don't listen to anyone who compares this to Freelancer (Freelance was much more of an arcade game), if you enjoyed Freelancer there is no guarantee you will enjoy this game.First I will list what I though were the good points :-Graphics are pretty good for a game of its age. -Reasonable sound with great music.-A HUGE universe to explore.-A plethora of different ships, space stations, weapons, ship equipment, etc. (the vast majority of which the player can own themselves).-A bustling trade universe with many resources and end products which the player can trade in.-Great sandbox feel to the game, you could play for hundreds of hours and build a huge trade empire or combat fleet without ever touching on a ""Plot"" mission.-A very helpful and dedicated fan base who are more than willing to help out new players (dont think i have ever seen the word ""noob"" on any forum/thread), there is a huge resource of info about the game on various websites/youtube and there is a large modding/scripting community.Now the not-so-good :-The game interface can be pretty cryptic and is not very intuitive at all. It took me a long time to figure it out (in fact I still dont think I have it figured out fully). A lot of the fans of the X series will praise the interface but I think they are comparing to previous X games (which must have had a truly aweful interface).-The AI can be pretty dumb, flying ships into stations or something simmilar. However i think this has been mostly sorted out in the later versions of the game.-Missions directives can sometimes be quite confusing and it is easilly possible for a player to accept a mission that they are vastly under-equiped for, which is just poor game design IMO.-Some of the plot mission requirements are absolutely insane and from what I have read, many players opt to mod the game to lower the requirements (because they really are that rediculous, requiring the player to amass huge amounts of resources) which feels a bit like cheating to me. But remember, you don't HAVE to do the plot (sandbox).-Very little in the way of in-game tutorials leaving the player to figure out most of it on their own. I for one, dont mind having to sift through the manual or read the wiki to figure stuff out, but for some this will be a deal-breaker.-The need to mod the game.... you really do have to. The vanilla game is sadly lacking in certain areas and without some of the mods the vanilla game feels like a beta.-The NPC voices are incredibly anoying!!!In conclusion this is a game with huge potential so long as you are willing to put in hundreds of hours of gameplay (its like having a second job!!). It can be very rewarding and incredibly frustrating at the same time. The interface can be very irritating at times but if you can get to grips with it, there is a lot of enjoyment to be had. If you are looking at buying this game I would highly recommend having a look at the available mods and what they do BEFORE you start playing, because some of the mods require you to restart the game from the beginning before they will take effect.A vast, deep game with huge potential so long as you are willing to put in the time and can get past the steep learning curve.

While the game starts slow, you have the power to build a huge economic empire, and use that to fuel your battle fleet.  Set your own goals, crush your enemies, monopolize the space trade!And there's a very good modding community if the base game is not enough for ya.			"

												We, as gamers, generally want the same things from developers as professional sports teams want from athletes -- effort and desire. In X3: Terran Conflict, EgoSoft has clearly given us both. Lovingly concocted, generally well executed, and hampered only by a few niggles, this is a game that not only achieves its goal -- plunking us into another time and place to live the life of an entrepreneurial spaceman -- but shows us that some titles can truly take us places.A must have Space Sim for all Ages. Absolutely stunning.			"

This game isn't for everyone though. There's a steep learning curve and you have to be patient because you start with nothing but a ship. I chose the merchant's path. Built my first two stations and have around 15 ships. Now it's just my trading empire I need :)			"

												Explore, trade and do combat with races and factions of the X-Universe.Play the Story plots like the Terran plot to reunite Earth with the long lost Aldrin colony or any of the others and gain the rewards of unique ships or locations or try your hand at space trading and make your own trade empire or why not take your hands on total destruction and destroy all you met, who knows what you will do in this open ended game.This is one of few games that I have clocked 500+ hours into and will probably still keep playing for a long time yet so if you are into space simulation, exploration and trade you will probably play 100+ hours and still find things that will keep you playing.

												I was playing this game long before i have personal internet connection.At first most people think this game was boring because is too quiet there no this and that, but the longer you play the better it is. Always play using the merchant as starter until had enough money to buy a corvete then go nuts.Use mod out there to make this game much more interesting specially race war in most border sector.All choice has it own consequences, each race has their own benefit including pirate, be good or evil is up to you, hijack the weakling or helping them is up to you, ally or war with certain race is up to you.Without mod it is only 7/10 due to need a long time for start to be fun, but with mod i can say it is 9/10 (graph is not what you can hope for this game except Albion prelude or Rebirth)For turret positioning i suggest you use MARS (go check in EGOSOFT forum)Note : Dont use cheat, why ? because once you used it you will be addict like me lol.Just back after off from many games, this game is still amazing though there is many space sim out there, but for sandbox full of thriller this game still serve the best (for me)			"

												Forget the last installment (X:Rebirth). This is the absolute crown of the series.Amazing depth, complexity, moddability and visuals, this Ship of the line of the X-series puts you in a truly captivating and immersive universe for you to explore. I've spent countless hours back before on non steam version with simply exploring systems as I searched for lucrative trade opportunities and keeping an eye out for hostile presence on the scanners, but if you want to do mission, bounty hunt, build or pirate, you have all the opportunities.My favourite of the X series. The interface might be a bit intimidating first, but you can soon get used to it and it truly feels like a complex, scriptable ship computer, again adding a bit to the immersion and the tools it offers to the player in commands and mods are endless.

												This is a true Space Simulator, it has amazing depth and complexity and features that most space simulators lack, from capturing ships with marines, to making a commercial empire while using the money from it to fund a private fleet for your own purposes or sabotage rival merchants  in real time. One of the biggest features is responsive ai that truly think independently, if you attack their assets or blockade their freighters they will send a response fleet to deliver their message in fire and fury, or attack your own vessels and assets, they also develop stations and construct their own empires as you would too. the only dissavantages to this game lies in its complexity and its camera, this game is so complex that it can be very intimidating for casual rpg'ers and its camera is none to fancy either and very sticky, with only a first person view and a third person view that is also in only one angle (you cant move the camera) however because of this, dogfights and battles tend to be more advance as more precise ship controls add to the elements. All in all i give it a 8 out of 10 and so far is very fun ( i have done some backgroud research) for a single player game it is simply outstanding and surprising what it can offer.			"

At that point, you'll be super-powered and you'll have all the cash you could ever need - there are no challenges left to be conquered unless steam achievements are important to you.

												This is a good, albeit slow-paced, sandbox space simulator with a fully realized intersteller supply-and-demand based business economy. X3 offers plenty of eye candy all around; its universe is a beautiful place. Follow the main story, or break away and come back to it as you please. Fully customize your starting ship(s) with upgrades to weapons, navigation, optics, etc. as you can afford them.  Work your way up in the corporate world by purchasing manufacturing spacestations, cargo vessels to transport goods and fighters to defend stations or escort vessels; build a financial empire, be your own Builderberg Group. Eventually, you can purchase an armada of capital ships and support vessels that you can use to supplement your firepower inside and outside of the main plot. You can helm any vehicle you purchase (provided you're close enough for a short spacewalk), and then, with upgradable ship computer software, issue orders to the rest of your fleets from the comfort of your captains seat. Maintain diplomacy with a variety of alien species, some of whom are mortal enemies, neutrals, allies, and still others who will eventually warm up to you after you invest some cash in their economies or shoot down enemies inside their sectors. Chilled out game-relaxing at times-that you can play with one hand on the mouse, or using the keyboard only, or both if you choose; it works however you want to play it. It's a complete change of pace from FPS games, and there can be long dull intervals between exciting firefights. Think of it as Elder Scrolls: Oblivion in space. Epic. Be who you want to be: Trader, Fighter, Fleet Commander, Pirate, Business Mogul. The choice is yours.			"

												This game is a lot of fun to a degree... I have to say even for how old the game is at this part the graphics are great, HD great but good enough for a space game. Controls are great and even better with a joy stick.For everything great about the game the only real problem with this game i really have is it doesn't have much of a story or anything to really drive you forward outside of your want to get money, get bigger space ships, and basically making your own space empire in a sector you basically took over.Another problem is your all of your other ships controlled by the AI are just dumb. you will set up lets say 4 body guard ships and if they go fast well guess what they will either run into you or each other and blow up. considering how much money you have to put into a ship that is very hard on you and almost not even worth having them. 90% of the time i just go at it alone and just have them guard my transports...this makes it very hard to take on the many missions that pitch you against 7 to 8 ships at a time. But the last problem that is and isn't a problem, is how much time it takes to get around the map. They have a item you get and sometimes you have buy because it can be destoried by the way to speed up time. it doesn't make you go faster, it just makes time go by faster. it can take a lot of time getting anywhere...So there is a lot of good things about this game but those few things make this game hard to play and enjoy. But it is doable if you take the time, you can get Moddings that can make the game more enjoyable so have fun.			"

												6 out of 10You get to build a space empire.  Who doesn't want to build a space empire?  Sadly though the game has some buggy bits that undermine its brilliance.You fly a space ship of your choice while building a trade fleet, gigantic space factories and armadas of fighters, frigates and destroyers. The good: 1. You get to build a space empire 2. Vast space environment.  Many factions, ships, factories and goods to master. 3. Friend or enemy?  You choose. The bad: 4. No real storyline. 5. There are many useful scripts to automate your space fleet but somehow they fall short of what you really want. 6. Within more than 100 hours I have really scratched the game's surface.  It really takes a huge amount of time to get anywhere. 7. Running your space empire becomes very tedious. The ugly: 8. Automated ships have horrendous collision detection.  I have lost far more ships to collisions than to enemy fire. I feel that a modern version of X3 could be an amazing game.  This game however never delivers a climax, it is a long drawn out ""nice"" experience.			"

												I absolutely love this game. It took me a while to figure out how to get a hold of the game, but after I read a quick guide I got the hang of what to do. The large variety of ships to pilot and different styles of game play you can take is what makes this so great. Want to buy and sell, do it, get a ship big enough. Find yourself wanting to partake in some fighting, get a fighter or build the largest fleet that you can and destroy whatever you want. I need to rack more hours in these game because it always keeps me highly entertained and involved in the story and allows me to create my own path. Yes, it takes time to get into it, but it is well worth the time if you enjoy space games. I particularly enjoy the fact that my Intel HD 4400 graphics on my i7 computer can run this without lag and take this game like a champ where most games can’t.			"

												Massive Space Sim.Go from nothing in a tin can to massive trading empire.Start with no guns, end up with carrier battle groups at your command.This technological terror does more than kill planets and fleets, it allows you to annihilate entire races and build manufacturing complexes to supply your endless thirst for combat. You can pilot a single seat space superiority fighter or command a warship capable of laying waste to an entire sector singlehandedly.This ain't like dusting crops boy. There is however a steep learning curve, and the more you fight and defeat an enemy the higher your combat rating gets, so it will not possible to continue treating the game like a space combat sim. The enemy forces thrown at you during missions will evolve to meet your combat rating. The more you kill the harder it gets to stay a fighter jock. Eventually you have to become a fleet commander just to survive a fight. In so doing, the bigger your fleet gets and the more cash and equipment you will need to outfit it. This is where trading and empire building becomes more than just an entertaining tangent.Play the game, become your own nation, do as you please because you can gain full control of the gate network and your own sectors....and the Paranid will still insult you.

Probably won't ever play this game again.Day 2: Learned that there's a solution for that. Felt stupid.Day 3: I'm getting good! I'm gonna try a combat mission. That was easy! I'll take on these four pirates. Nope! I'm not getting good....Day 5: Spend 80% of my money on a trade ship and get him to do remote trade runs while I fly around in a scout. He gets killed before making back 10% of the cost. I'm broke....Day 8: Got a big ship with big guns. Installed shields, went to battle. Got wrecked. Had wrong shields installed. Still not good at the game.Day 9: Accepted a Very Hard combat mission to assassinate a guy in a Corvette class ship while flying in a scout.

												Massive Space Sim.Go from nothing in a tin can to massive trading empire.Start with no guns, end up with carrier battle groups at your command.This technological terror does more than kill planets and fleets, it allows you to annihilate entire races and build manufacturing complexes to supply your endless thirst for combat. You can pilot a single seat space superiority fighter or command a warship capable of laying waste to an entire sector singlehandedly.This ain't like dusting crops boy. There is however a steep learning curve, and the more you fight and defeat an enemy the higher your combat rating gets, so it will not possible to continue treating the game like a space combat sim. The enemy forces thrown at you during missions will evolve to meet your combat rating. The more you kill the harder it gets to stay a fighter jock. Eventually you have to become a fleet commander just to survive a fight. In so doing, the bigger your fleet gets and the more cash and equipment you will need to outfit it. This is where trading and empire building becomes more than just an entertaining tangent.Play the game, become your own nation, do as you please because you can gain full control of the gate network and your own sectors....and the Paranid will still insult you.

												X3: Terran Conflict (and the X3 series in general) is difficult to write a recommendation for because I'm not really sure why I love it. In fact, every time I try to talk about it, I inevitably get round to a laundry-list of complaints, particularly about the interface or the AI. But paradoxically, not being sure why I love it is exactly the reason I love it, and the reason X3:TC is my single most-played game.I've never been a fan of the nostalgist's lament that games were better in the old days, but one thing that a lot of modern games are is predictable. Sure, I like them, but I know exactly why I like them, because they've been risk-aversely designed to be obviously enjoyable. X3:TC is enjoyable, but not obviously so, and in that, it recaptures some of the magic of an older generation of games.If you like games where polish has been sacrificed for depth and vastness, and games where your own personal goals become more important than the embedded storyline, then definitely check out X3:TC. Be warned, though: it will eat your life.			"

												  Much better UI makes a diamond in the rough of a series finally polished enough to be accessible. This game has more depth and attention to detail than any other sand box game , space or otherwise I have ever seen. What was once a series that demanded hours of research to fly from A to B , is now a beatiful game that begs you to make it yours and to explore and to care about it and to loose hours and hours of your time. But I did my research a plenty trying to play the others, I went into this with a solid knowledge base. That its improvements to the UI was just enough to get me to tollerate its still rather complex interface. But at least I can say that for the most part its interface is complex out of necessity, for all that it lets you do and command, rather than out of a masochist love for obfuscation and ellusiveness.  Just be warned this is by no means an easy game to get started in, and I highly recommend printing out or reading one of the MANY ""noob"" tutorials out there.			"

												If you are a space sim fan and have run out of titles to choose from, then this game is worth a go. There is a lot of depth and many different ships to fly within a huge open universe. That being said, there is a huge learning curve to go with the depth. I found myself browsing the web for answers on how to do even the simplest of things far more often than I would have liked.  The tutorial is...well, you on a search engine because the developer felt as though only people who had played their previous entries would be playing this game.  The graphics are nice but there is no getting out to explore planets or space stations. You are limited to being in or around a ship throughout the entire game. In fact, you will never be planetside at all.  The AI is horribly broken to the point that it could frustrate Ghandi, assuming that Ghandi would have been a video game nerd (I'm not sure he'd be a space sim fan if he was), which constantly gives you the ultimatum of either losing large amounts of money or reloading your previous save. Choosing either option causes you to feel as though you have recieved the raw end of the deal since you will never get back the time spent. If you are not like Ghandi the space sim fan and prefer action to trade then you again shouldn't bother as you will indeed be bored. There is action but there is far more travel-time than action and when it does break out, the enemy A.I. is not very bright and the outcome is based on a numbers game (who has more firepower). I personally don't mind travel-time in a space sim game but I'm sure it is only because I like the genre and the exploration that comes with it as opposed to enjoying this particular franchise. Sadly, there is no cockpit view to enjoy the exploration with and the camera is rather limited as well. There is a couple of outside views available but one of those views cannot be used to navigate intuitively and the other view is a camera stuck directly behind your burners with no allowance for deviation so you cannot really see your ship anyhow. It's possible there is an option somewhere to move this camera but it seems that will be another research topic for when I play the game next...which would be whenever I'm bored of poking myself in the eye with a stick.

It frustrates me, makes me mad, and just manages to generally♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.  But...It's one of the best games I've ever played, and I can't recommend it enough.  The story is great, the combat is exciting, and the environment is beautiful.  I'd only recommend playing this game if you like games that don't hold your hand, and push you at every turn.  If you're into that sort of thing, this is the game for you.

												Beautiful and expansive but the core gameplay is too damn tedious for this game to be fun.  It's a real shame; X3 is visually stunning, and the terran vessels and stations are excellent designs - the most solid, realistic space structures I've seen in a game.There's a lot of micro-manangement.  If you want to control a vast empire expect to do a lot of menu surfing.It takes a long time to get anywhere and a long time to do anything.  In order to achieve your goals, you'll find that menus are constantly covering what would be a beautiful view of space.I wasn't able enjoy much of the story as the pre-requistes for beginning the next mission involved a lot of tedious gameplay.So sad, I really wanted to like this.

												This of the bunch really stands out from the rest, not only for the comprehensive and very fluent controls, but for the general feel and charm. It makes me laugh at how people relate the X series to Elite Dangerous and Star Citizen, basing it off of X-Rebirth, the casual bad seed of the bunch. Though Elite Dangerous has a very quirky and uneventful feel to it, it's just as linear as the newest addition to the series, giving much reason for bashing. Star citizen? Hype train with little to show. With almost 37 hours in the first week, I am happy to say that I have only barely scratched the surface! I would recommend this to anyone who would like to learn the X series, giving you the ability to jump in, and, (with the help of reading the controls menu, which seems like a foreign concept to some) I was able to learn my simple functions. Mechanics came logically afterwards, using a click on something before attempting to use corresponding hotkeys. Just don't forget to save! In a world rich with lore, content (every ship/carrier/station can be owned and/or piloted), mystery, and countless hours of unique experience. Oh, and not to mention; It's cheaper than the competition~Happy voyaging :3			"

												X3: Terran Conflict put one, very important thing into perspective for me: space is astronomically huge. (Pun so very much intended.) It also taught me something very important: it takes way too damned long to fly anywhere in space. Let’s do this.I – Story [5/10]X3: Terran Conflict is an open world, simulation game from Egosoft. There are multiple stories for the player to choose from, but I will be dealing specifically with the first one, “Terran Defender”.The player assumes the role of a Terran pilot who is out on a routine patrol in the solar system when, suddenly, they are summoned to aid in a battle at Neptune. Xenon pilots, using special beacons, were able to jump deep into the system; bypassing the usage of a jumpgate. During the ensuing chaos, a drone steals information from the Terran station at Neptune and delivers it to an Argon ship near Pluto. After the battle, the player is given the task of investigating the hostile activity of the Xenon, who are suspected to be under the influence of a hitherto unknown source.Xenon and various pirate factions are discovered to be coordinating raids on ships for valuable resources. New ships begin to appear, which resemble Terraformers (Boron warships). The player assists in the delivery of Terraformer wreckage to Terran scientists who are able to deduce that the new ships are counterfeits based heavily upon commonwealth technology.Robert Pearle (an undercover Terran operative) has information concerning the origins of the new Terraformer ships, but he has been taken into custody by Argon forces. The player meets up with a fellow Terran agent, Patricia Heywood, and the two set off to rescue Pearle from the Argons. Following Pearle’s extraction, he accompanies the player on a mission to Split Space where it is rumored that the new Terraformers are being built. A mobile factory is discovered and taken by Terran forces and several Split scientists are taken prisoner as well. During interrogation, one of the scientists mentions the name Aldrin. (Aldrin was a Terran colony that was established long before the Terraformer War. The colonists at Aldrin managed to shut down their jumpgate and protect their Terraformers from the software error. Aldrin had been presumably lost during the war.)The Terrans launch an offensive; reverse-engineering a jump beacon to get a fleet to Aldrin. A fleet of Xenon ships joins the battle against the Terrans, defending the Terraformers. A boarding party successfully takes control of the Terraformer CPU ship and the player is tasked with escorting Aldrin dignitaries to the Earth Torus, thereby opening Earth to the player.Had I played the previous games in the series (which I was unaware was a series until I started into this review) I probably would have enjoyed the story more than I did. That being said, the story was still okay (and very reminiscent of the opening mission of the first Mass Effect).II – UI [7/10]Once I figured the user interface out (for the most part) it was a great system for the game. There was a “tutorial” (for lack of a better word), but it was not all encompassing. I felt a bit on my own to figure out the more advanced functions of the game. There was no minimap, which put quite a handicap on navigating. Aside from this though, the user interface, as I said, worked great for the game.III – Gameplay [7/10]Gameplay in X3:TC was really fun. Learning how the UI worked took some time, but the gameplay itself, was very unique. It is all first-person, whether you’re nestled safely inside your vessel or ejecting into the merciless void of space. It was a great way to explore and I sincerely hope we see things like this much more in games that are yet to be released.My biggest complaint about the gameplay, however, is that (aside from combat) it is incredibly slow paced. If travel time had been done in relation to how long most people can stare into the abyss, it would have been okay. With the exception of the Grinch and sociopaths the world over, travel times can become extremely boring.IV – Content [10/10]There is a truly massive amount of content in X3:TC. There is a huge universe to explore (and exploring it fully could very well take you the amount of time it would take a real astronaut), tons of missions, over 100 ships, ship classes, and weaponry. If you can stay interested long enough to discover it all, more power to you.V – Visual [7/10]The graphics in X3:TC are decent. Taking into consideration that immense scale of the game, the graphics are about what you’d expect. While they’re not bad, they’re not outstanding.VI – Audio [5/10]I was rather unimpressed with the music of X3:TC. The soundtrack can often make or break a game (or salvage it from a gruesome end) but the music felt uninspired and pumped full of space-y noises. The sound effects weren’t bad and the voice acting was alright as well.VII – Overall [6.8/10]Overall, X3: Terran Conflict is an alright game. I didn’t like it as much as the rating I gave it, but, that’s that.			"

												Beautiful and expansive but the core gameplay is too damn tedious for this game to be fun.  It's a real shame; X3 is visually stunning, and the terran vessels and stations are excellent designs - the most solid, realistic space structures I've seen in a game.There's a lot of micro-manangement.  If you want to control a vast empire expect to do a lot of menu surfing.It takes a long time to get anywhere and a long time to do anything.  In order to achieve your goals, you'll find that menus are constantly covering what would be a beautiful view of space.I wasn't able enjoy much of the story as the pre-requistes for beginning the next mission involved a lot of tedious gameplay.So sad, I really wanted to like this.

												This game has some serious balance issues.  You will start off easy enough, but not have any missions except to track down criminals or patrol sectors.  Most of the criminals will be too far away to reach in time.You have to fly a significant distance and get a lot of money before you can afford a jump drive.  A jump drive then gives you the ability to do most of the missions.Real money collection comes from capturing damaged ships and selling them.This game is not for rookies.Graphics are top notch, however, capital ship explosions could have been improved, they mostly just play a large 2D explosion animation, and then the ship disappears, no debris, nothing.  Frequently you can visibly see the ship disappear.Game pace is way to slow.Recommended only if you are willing to download mods to fix the problems.			"

												This game has a great concept but poor execution. You have to go several menus deep to do most things, and I find myself spending most of my time repeating the same series of clicks over and over again. Maybe there is a better way to do it, but the game gives you no help in finding out what that might be. I watched several videos, and read tutorials online before playing, and even then I was expecting a steep learning curve. Which is fine. That's not the issue, the issue is the poor design of the game. The game gives you the option to trade lots of different goods, but in reality you can only trade energy cells and ore at the start. The others never vary enough in price to make them worth trading. The ""dynamic"" trade system results in the AI traders contently supplying factories with everything they need so the price never changes. The result is far from dynamic.I found my greatest goal in the game was to get an automated trader so I wouldn't have to do the mind numbing, and painfully slow trading myself. You know something is wrong when the goal of playing a game is to make it so you don't have to play the game.Another guide I read said you can build cash with missions. So I tried that. Except when you start out you can't do most missions. My slow trading ship can't do the trade missions fast enough. My discover can't haul enough, or fight well enough. A lot of missions require special equipment. So you fly around to 5 sectors looking for 1 mission you can actually do, then make a few thousand or tens of thousands or credits. I don't mind low rewards starting off, or hard to complete missions. The thing that gets me is having to tediously check 10-20 missions before you can find 1 you like. And it's not like you can fly into a sector and access all of the missions available in an quick, easy way either, no just get ready to mindlessly click through more menus.  Even with all of that, the game has potential, and I can see where it could be fun once you get the hang of it. But if you don't have hours and hours to sink into a game, and a lot of patients to slog through the learning curve, you're going to get frustrated with this game. Maybe once you're an expert the game is fun enough that you can ignore the poor deign, but I can't.			"

Why ? I'm rich.-Build a station to gain more money ? Why ? I'm rich.You must know too, that every action is... convoluted, you must send commands for each action :For exemple, clic on a spaceship, then type ""c"", ""3"", ""1"" to tell him to buy something, then clic on the sector, then the station, then what to buy... It's not exactly like this, I don't exactly remember the commands, but the most important is here.If the trading system make you rich without playing, it's different when you just need to equip your M1 with lasers and missiles, it's a torture even for me that played factorio with mods.

												No disappointments.  I was looking for an immersive single player space game, and X3 completely delivers.  The universe is huge - and there is a custom mode that somewhat randomizes the game, although it disables some key quests, so I haven't tried it.  Even without that, I have hundreds of hours logged and still haven't explored all the systems.Things missing from the game that would have improved it: customizable ship designs (you can only customize the amount of shields and weapons, but not the speed/acceleration/weight/etc).  Even without that, just getting the weapons you want manufactured and configuring a ship, fleet, or economic infrastructure gives plenty to keep track of.The tone of the game is dry - it's a German, serious Space Odyssey.  If I'd bought this when it first came out, I'd have shelved it, because the quests are almost impossible to figure out.  But now there are loads of tutorials online (both videos and forum posts) that make the game accessible.5 stars.			"

												I played X2 and couldn't get into it. This one (which I've played just a little during the free weekend) is much more user-friendly. It's more complex than Galaxy on Fire (one of my favorite arcade-y space games), but there's an intriguing depth to the gameplay. If you're willing to put in some work and want to feel like you're really in an enormous galaxy of galaxies, check it out.---- EDIT ----After playing some more, I've decided that this game simply isn't for me. Moving around is slow (even when the acceleration SETA active), and navigation is pretty complicated. Worst of all -- the game only saves when you dock at a station, so after I spent 20 minutes chasing a pirate through four systems, his buddies killed me and I had to start all the way back at the first system. Maybe I've become spoiled by modern autosave features, or maybe I just prefer a more arcadey style. It's possible that I'll come back and give this one another try, but for now I'm going back to GoF.			"

It can drops very fast to not even 30 FPs with 6x the Recommended Specs. Reason is the bad Core using of this game. AMD CPUs will slow down in sectors with asteroid or much stations while RAM&GPUs chill like hell ^^)FAZIT: 7.6/10 (FPS issues known with my AMD Fx 8350 4GHZ 8 Core)			"

												Great graphics, excellent atmosphere. But i was looking for something a bit more like elite. Its almost it, but no freedom at all, your entire game will be dictated by the warp rings. You cant fly to nearby planets, or skim close to suns, you cant explore nebulea or anything. They grabbed a good game concept from elite, stripped all the freedom of space from it, made it look better, then set it loose. I think its an easy way out, to place a sheet of artwork in the background, then let you move around in that art, but not interact with it. A tease really. Yet another space game that is ruled by warp lanes. Boring.			"

I can see how alot of people love this game, as it does have A TON of AWESOME stuff.love space? check.love great design? check.love no tutorial at all? check.Love a difficulty curve the size of foocking jupiter? check..Love a game whose controls are even more confusing than some modern flying simulators? CHECK...LOVE HUGE CRASHES THAT ERASE ALL YOUR FOOCKING SAVE PROGRESS 10 TIMES?!?!?! MOTHER FOOCKING CHECK!!!seriously though this game is awesome! i loved playing the first few days of it, but the thing is... during all of that, the one HUGE thing that i ABSOLUTELY DESPISE about this game? Traveling. It took me 2 days to get to the point where i could go much faster, or even instant traveling. Im glad its in the game, but seriously? Give this to me IMMEDIATELY. Do you know how many times i just sat back and waited 5 minutes to get from point a to point b? point a being maybe... 30Km away? thats the shortest distance btw. Ive had to travel up to 130Km away. Which means a total of 15 minute wait times... then when i get there, i may just have to wait another 10 for anything to actually happen... youre joking right? thats 25 minutes just to do ONE step. Of a beginning mission. One that has 15 steps... Oh good god...see why thats annoying?? dont get me wrong, i LOVE this game. It did get me hooked, but it took so LONG for me to get hooked... A game should be keeping me up to 2 am in the morning wanting just to do that one last step to a mission, just to find out theres two more steps, then staying up all night to finish it. But instead this game seems to want its begining to be the exact OPPOSITE of that. Which is saddening... This game is not all like that. Power through the begining as fast as possible and you get to the meat of the game.If anything im writing this as a warning to those who are just starting. Be ready to work your A$$ off to get to the actual begining of the game, and kick major xenon booty.Other than that, this game is damn near flawless. 8.5/1014/space    would nap between travel times again.

												I remember in my youth days playing the first ever game of X series (can't remember the name). It was awesome in its own way. It had an open world, trading aspect, dogfight, construction and an interesting plot. It buried into my mind as one of these games that kept one coming back.Several years later we got X3, which brought back memories and made me glee with expectations. Unfortunately I was deeply disappointed.One would expect that after so much time the series would improve significantly and draw some of the best solutions from other successful games. This here has not happened. It seems the game have stopped mentally in early 2000 but went on graphically to current gen. The world is VAST, gigantically OPEN, enormously FREE, pleasingly NEAT, and you are free to do as You please, in every aspect of this word. But before You do, there is a discouraging amount of things You first need to learn.One would expect to learn some basics of trading, exploring, upgrading, before even trying to comprehend the advanced forms of play. This here does not happen. What You're introduced to, is bare basics of ship control, and that's all. Looking at key configuration I had the feeling that someone outsourced tutorials to a player that had the game for 30 minutes. You're just thrown into the universe and be like ""oh, You're here, follow me into this sector we've got some bad guys to kill"". That's just an insignificant fraction of what the game has in store.X3 has almost nothing to offer in terms of introducing You into the world, apart from opening cinematic, and because of that it is unenjoyable from the beginning. You ask what's later? I don't know - I've been disappointed by game design to the point that I didn't want to find out. And believe me, I tried two times already in span of 2 years.There are other games worth Your time in terms of space exploration, trading, fights and empire building. Games like EVE, Freespace, Freelancer...IF You have time - take it at Your own risk. Otherwise - seek other solutions.			"

Even without that, just getting the weapons you want manufactured and configuring a ship, fleet, or economic infrastructure gives plenty to keep track of.The tone of the game is dry - it's a German, serious Space Odyssey.  If I'd bought this when it first came out, I'd have shelved it, because the quests are almost impossible to figure out.  But now there are loads of tutorials online (both videos and forum posts) that make the game accessible.5 stars.			"

												The concept of the game is really cool. However, the game primarily focuses on movement. It takes too long to get anywhere. There are other games similar to this out there that allow you to jump drive to places. This one sort of does  but it takes fuel and so you cant jump as often.Still, I would be willing to forgive it if only there werent so many bugs. Also, the fact that there are tons of missions that require certain stuff to complete but nowhere does it even hint to it will cause a lot of FAILED missions.Basically you start this game as a failure in everything and still I was willing to keep trying. I gave it a couple of tries and then finally quit when a bug ruined one of my missions.			"

												Rating: 4/10 -- ★★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆Valve: Please change recommendation/review system to use a 10 point star system. Much more accurate than ""yes/no"".The lack of a proper tutorial was the biggest issue, overall it just seems the game play is really really slow for me and the controls aren't exactly that great either.  I'm more used to W and S being go and stop/reverse, but instead it's Z and X that does that (or mouse wheel).  That wouldn't be the biggest issue though, as X Rebirth is the same way but, I can actually play it without that many problems and seems to be a much better game.  I guess this game, just seems to be too slow for me, oldish style graphics and everything is scaled badly.  You've got this tiny tiny mini itty bitty hole for docking which makes you feel like a peanut compared to the station.  Everything seems to take ages to get past even with time warp making you feel even smaller than a peanut flying past the station.  I myself do not like this game, so I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												This is not a game.This is a meditation simulator... just float for ages from one system to another, talk to random ships... dock, buy, sell... all in space with backgrounds that you would probably see in astronomer's wet dream... planets, stars, giant starbases, ... Really chill...Also, some of the worst (if not the worst) interface I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot). Pathfinding is gamebreaking and I am beginning to wonder how hard is it to actually program something like ""Move from A to B"". Saving system for a game this difficult is atrocious.			"

												I was really close to give this game a YES, but there are few things that stopped me from doing it. First of all, the game has great potential, but execution is a bit lacking.First thing - the on board computer - it's driving me insane! I don;t know who came up with the idea that people will love hearing the emotionless voice reading over and over THE SAME GOD DAMNED SENTENCE n times in a row every time you click something. You click a station? Mining facility is bla bla bla... you want to sell the meat to the weapon factory? Of course, but let me sing you the song of my people! ""The small sidearms factory produces[...]"" emmm, thank, I just wanted to sell the meat... ""The blabla meat steak is a nutrishious"".To make things worse, you can disable all voice or none. Had I played this game any longer, I would have gone mad and started hearing those voices in my head...Next thing is the interface - it's not bad per se, it's just a bit confusing at first (took me about an hour to learn how to pilot the ship as all the controls are described in relation to joystick or a pad - but playing it with mouse and keyboard is actually good, but takes time getting used to it.Newbie friendly? Nope. Here, pick a starting game - we won't tell you what which one exactly gives so have fun guessing.I picked the humble merchant and from what I read online it is the best start.The game takes ages to start - for hours you just fly from one station to another buying and selling - looks like a wasted time to me. If you are a fighter pilot who just rushes from place to place to shoot things it's probably fun, but if you visit the same station every 10 or so minutes... ""The asteroid mining facility"" Aaagh, the voices returned!I'll probably grind it some more and se if I can get a decent profit to build up a small cargo fleet and set it to be automatic so that I could focus on other things, but so far, the voices alone are a reason to avoid this game.Did I mention the voices?EDIT - before someone rages - I disabled the voices - all of them, but it's removing the useful announcements as well as the info spam			"

												I didn't like this game, I found it boring and slow, with a lot of unneccessary flying around from place to place with little or no direction.  Even the space battles were boring to me.  I can see why certain people might like this game, because it plays like a flight simulator, and I have friends that can just fly around all day in their flight sims and be totally happy, but I find it dull and boring, just my personal opinion.If you like flight simulators much more than aerial combat games, then you will probably like this game, but if you are like me, and you grew up playing wing commander, xwing, and colony wars, then you will be very dissappointed in this game, and in fact, I will tell you that there is no game made anymore like those old aerial combat games.  It is a dead genre, not sure why, but I guess gamers today prefer open roam flight sims and trade RTS over mission based combat games.I haven't played a decent aerial combat game since colony wars on the ps1, I just wish someone would remake xwing, it cant be that hard.

												Might be a brilliant game, but I'm never going to find out, due to the ridiculous learning curve. Played over an hour without an inkling of a clue as to what was going on, and with no evidence of an incentive or rewarding storyline, I was forced to switch off. A shame, really, because from the reviews I've read, it sounds like a well executed game, once you get past the 20 hour+ learning curve!If you have the patience of a saint (which I am lacking) then by all means, buy it, give it a go, but if you were, like me, expecting something engaging right off the bat, then prepare for disappointment.

												I've now played enough to know that although this game is better than X3:Reunion, the interface is still poorly designed and they've made it even more annoying, hard as that may be to believe. So it's still a game for people who have a lot of patience, who don't mind doing a lot of external research about things that should be in-game, and are satisfied playing poorly designed games with lousy user interfaces that go out of their way to waste the gamer's time. The good:Much better than X3:Reunion. A lot of the issues with that game were resolved here.The bad:Autopilot. At least in X3:Reunion is worked. Here, it doesn't. Which means that as you wait for your ship to crawl across the screen, even with a 10x speed-up (assuming you have it installed on a ship - WHY would it not be part of the game rather than having to be installed on each and every ship??), you can't trust the autopilot to do it right. At least in X3:Reunion I could read a book while waiting. With X3:Terran Conflict, you have to babysit the bloody thing all the time. So not only do they waste my time, they've made it so that I can't do anything ELSE while they're wasting it.The more bad:flight mechanics. The usual rant about THIS IS SPACE DARNIT!  It's not ""3D cars in mud"". If I stop my engine, I shouldn't just stop dead. I shouldn't have to loop around to get at someone behind me, I should just be able to kill my engine and turn around, still moving in the same direction I was moving in earlier. I'll put up with a lot of ""let's play fast and loose with reality"" for a game, but that one issue with space games is something I'll never accept. Freelancer got it right. So far I've not found another that has done so.The ugly:Nothing major so far. However, the game seems to revel in wasting the time of the player.  Where ""waste of time"" involves making me spend real, irreplaceable time doing things that end up having zero impact in the game, either because you have to reload or just accept that you've just spent the last 20 minutes for nothing. Over and over again.Examples:-- Still incredibly annoying, especially early game, as they make you pay (a lot) for the ability to save without docking to a station. This means that, early game, when you're weakest, you're having to start from much further back JUST as you thought you'd finished.  Once you can afford the ""save any time"" it gets easier. Until then, expect to be doing a lot of swearing. Or a lot of docking and saving, which is a massive time waster, especially on longer ""timed"" missions. -- There are a lot more locals than in X3:Reunion, which means that when you take on a mission that requires you to fight someone else, more than half the time someone else will kill them for you, which wastes your time because they only count the LAST shot, not the total damage you did. So you bring then down to near zero and some local asshat pots the final shot in for you, aborting the mission and wasting all the time you spent doing it so far.-- The autopilot in X3:Reunion only killed me once. That has changed in X3:TC, and the autopilot now will regulary attempt to ram you through a solid surface. Since ships that can take large amounts of weapons damage disintegrate at the slightest bump in this game, this, again, wastes time.-- Don't bother with ""covert missions"". They seem to be bugged. No matter what distance you follow (5/10/15/20/25) you'll either be too close, or you'll lose them. Another waste of time.Conclusion:Waste of time, highly annoying, and just too many issues for me to be able to kick back and enjoy it. Still looking for a decent ""space sim"" game in the Freelancer model. Still waiting.			"

												note: i played about 40 hours of Albion Prelude before trying the Terran Conflict version, when i realised this is just the same type of game, Albion Prelude is just some sort of DLC ! so this review counts for BOTH or better ALL ot the X-games.i got 3 words for this type of games: boredom in spaceWhat comes next is only MY PERSONAL OPINION about this game, and you might want to agree or disagree with me, that's fine, but leave your comments for yourself please if you want to rant against MY OPINION, ok? Thanks in advance.There are some pro's in this game, i have to admit, but there are just too many cons that made me stop 'playing' this 'game' :1. everything takes way too much time, you can't accomplish anything in under 100 hours of gameplay; that is 2 or more whole WEEKS of worktime in your job! so i assume that most people who play this game are either a) unemployed or b) have no real life (no offense) or c) are retired and have alot of time on their hands2. Interface is really bad, overly complicated and takes many hours to get used to; it feels like i am back to college trying to get a degree in spacetrading/spacenavigation... that is in my opinion not fun, but WORK, and i am here to have FUN, not work, because it's supposed to be a GAME, right?3. for a spacesim, it's more then unrealistic: you jump lightyears over lightyears in a matter of seconds, but the space you work in ones you arrive is about 120km in diameter only! makes no sense to me, sorry... i don't even want to talk about how long it takes to get from one gate to the next one, even with 6x timespeeds (called SETA here). oh and then you have to 'explore' those sectors first? haha... that would be ok if it's space that belongs to another race, but the terrans and argons should know from the start where their planets are right? i get it, all those things are there so it can keep you busy, 'exploring' """"""new"""""" planets... problem is, they are already there when you started the game, so it's only new to YOU, right? kills any immersion for me to be honest.4. Jumpdrives need energycells so you can use them... are we in the 21st century? never heared of any spacegame or sci-fi series before that you need a f... battery to use a jumpdrive device of some sort that brings you halfway across the universe... it this a TESLA Demeter or what? Don't tell me this game wants to be environment-friendly! LOL5. Boredom in space for me is this: for about 3 minutes of action you need hours of preparation sometimes, and the rewards you get are often far worse then the cost. It may be me, but that's just not fun, is it? It's like going 1 step forward and 2 steps back...Ok there are mods out there that can solve many of those problems, BUT i just don't have the patience any more to deal with installing those mods and hope they work properly so you can finally, hopefully enjoy a game and hope that it doesn't crash BECAUSE of those mods! There is even a mod that removes the jumpdrives out of the fighters completely, so you can not use them anymore with them! REALLY?This game has a huge fanbase (again i think it shows the actual unemployment rate we have in the country - j/k hehe), so there are a LOT of mods out there, but so many, it's a) hard to find the latest version that works with your game and/or other modsb) the links to them don't work any more because they are too old and the files got removedc) the time you need to read through all these forum posts to find the things you are looking for.... you get the ideaThere are so many more issues with this game that i could go on and on, but i don't want to waste any more of my time for that, so for players who consider buying this game, be warned: before you start to play this game do these things first:a) quit your jobb) end any existing relationships (if you had some before)c) get yourself a supply of food and water for several months so you don't have to leave your home EVERd) get yourself a supply of antidepressiva or other drugs that can keep you happy while reading all the information you can/must get about this game, because you will NEED to read alot before you start to understand what this game is all about (alcohol works too)e) be prepared to take a test after you read through all the material about this game (test will be playing the game itself)f) hide all items you could use to commit suizide ones you realise how much time you wasted for nothingg) find the uninstall buttonGood thing i bought this whole X-game stuff on sale for like 14 bucks, so it's not too big of a loss to me financially... i just want my wasted time back please ;-)			"

												A 1st person economic space sim game with RTS mechanics in space.Best value for your money is liking roleplaying in space.Worst value for you money is not liking grinding in space.Despite the inflated NPC capacity, the game feels dead. and space empty (duh), even when you're piloting capitol ships escorted by fighters. Same lines of dialogue. Same missions. Same endgame, i.e. more money than you'd know what to do with, every playthrough...Pretty galaxy sectors, and even more beautiful music though;

												About this game and its issues..This game is not multi-threaded so hangs off a single core, this causes lag and slowdown for many people once you get into larger ship battles (you will have to play probably 100 hours at least to get that far unless you research the x3 forums for hours for exploits and shortcuts). Even in larger sectors with many stations things are choppy to begin with.Missions are often unclear, boring & take very long periods of time to complete so you will need loads of patience.The economy is largely broken, your ai ships will fly into station often if you are in the same region of space and there is a ton of menus to navigate to do ANYTHING. Creating and managing stations is simply a badly implemented horrible exasperating experience.AVOID.			"

Is every zone a base surrounded by warp gates?I tried a few missions but failed them as I was travelling to the location, for some reason something about mission time (???) And so I set about becoming a trader instead.I took one look at the items, the prices and the time it takes to go to each station to cross reference and I laughed, no thanks. So I chose to explore the universe.There was nothing but stations, one derelict outpost and a few that were cloudy. Apart from new floaties and different music there was nothing to see. No encounters, nothing.I get that a lot of people like this game and after a lengthy search on my part, there are few space sims that are worth playing, but honestly I don't see what is so special about this.

												Got a 90% coupon on this very interesting game, however even after nearly 4 hours, I just couldn't get into it. Such a complicated interface and the flight school seems to be the only tutorial. This game looks and seems to play nice, but it is so freaking hard to get into. Seems like the type of game I'd like, but if it takes me more than 3 hours to try and learn basic stuff about what you can do to start off, it just isn't worth the time. It would be comparable to taking 3 hours to figure out how to shoot a gun in a FPS game.My score for content would probably be a 9/10 based on what I youtubed, but not noob friendly at all.			"

												TL;DR;-Slow game pace (Even for a space game I consider the pace too slow)-instanced space pockets = Vast universe now apparently (Wth are people smoking)-Game mechanics don't make sense (Repairing costs more than buying a new ship)-Misions are too random and unbalanced meaning you wont be able to do most of them.-Cannot save game on the fly, you must dock which is a tedious task (even with autopilot).-Buggy autopilot, basic controls, camara and UI makes this game less appealing.I heard someone say on a forum something like ""The game is long, not slow"". That of course is wrong. Skyrim is long. This game IS SLOW.The game like many other space games fail on one simple thing; Travel time. Due to this, you spend about 90% of your time traveling from destination X to Y to Z. And in this game it does little to take away that factor. You may as well be watching a screen saver. You cannot save the game until you are docked. Which only reduces yet again the pace of the game. If you dont save your game, you littlerly have to start again if/when you die. This means, yes, more traveling and doing the same♥♥♥♥♥♥you just did an hour ago. (Oh and docking aint fun in this game, there is no ""click and dock"" you have to either wait for the slow♥♥♥♥♥♥autopilot or manually dock yourself)The game is not vast despite what you might hear. You go from sector to sector via warp gates. It's just a load of instances linked together. Oh and you cannot interact with planets in any way. They are just background art.The controls, camera and UI are very basic. Giving commands to your other ships is executed poorly. You can give limited quick commands when targeting other ships (Or rather I should say command) which is attack. Thats it. The autopilot is also buggy, a lot of the time it will just throw you about makiing you puke from motion sickness.Some other things that don't make much sense: its cheaper to buy a new ship than to repair the one you have (And yes ships cost A LOT). Misions are completely randomized meaning that you wont be able to do like 90% of them near the start of your game. They are also unremarkable from what I've seen; ""Do this and get credits"" everytime.Glad I tried this game on free weakend. I won't be buying it and will not recomend it to anyone, one of the most boring and unbalanced space games I have played to date.			"

												Really wanted to like this game but the more I played it the more I came to just be frustrated by it.  Some of the first problems I encountered were a GUI that isn't as well done as it should have been.  As an example, start a to jump somewhere.  Game does a long count down.  If you accidentally move your ship during this time while trying to use its clunky interface it cancels the jump (but still uses up the energy for the jump).  The autopilot acts like its drunk making dizzying turns in odd directions rather than smoothly navigating around objects (so letting the computer pilot your ship anywhere other than open space in a straight line gets -- nauseating).  Sometimes your ship crashes just trying to auto-dock.  Upon getting a Deimos I discovered fighter AI pilots seemed to love to try to park right in front of my ship... DURING COMBAT (um, you know, right in front of my main guns... poof, or with 6 GJ of shielding versus a tiny fighter just run them over; either way it was comically dumb).  Not to mention the number of ships that seemed determine to ram you (how does a small frieghter not see a Boreas destroyer that's 10x its size, flying in a straight line and moving slowly?)   IMHO the autopilot is the single biggest weakness of the game.Your freighter fleets, once you start building your commercial empire are -- morons, there just no other way to put it.   You blacklist a sector and tell them DO NOT GO IN THERE... they go in there anyway because the black list tells them not to trade there, not to actually never enter that sector (so if they decide to fly through it on their way somewhere else... ALERT!  Pirates have blown up another fo your moron freighters.  Have a frustrating day).  They are not even smart enough to try an avoid pirates when they're spotted.  Instead your freighers will fly right up to a cluster of pirates or a Xenon Q if it happens to be in the path of where ever they're going (No, oh gee, I'm in a tiny freighter with paper shields and a single back facing popgun, there's a Xenon Q., oh well I'll just fly right past him.  Maybe he won't noti.... BOOM!   That's your automated freighters folks).  Your universal traders are even dumber, no only could I not find a way to get them to stay out of black listed sectors but even where I had advanced satellites out so they could see the pirates, or that big Xenon Q, before they ever entered the sector they flew right at em anyway.  Want a freighter just to shuttle cargo from one station to another, there's a script for that.  But again, it turns your freighter into a moron.  If its two stations in the same sector or adjacent sectors, that works okay.  But if it require jumping, you'll discover somehow your freighter with plenty of energy and a jumpdrive has suddenly forgotten how to use it.  Instead it stubbornly tries to fly the whole route.As your empire grows you find yourself constantly chasing after pirates that spawn even in core systems and attack your freighters.  I can understand this in border areas, but when you have two groups of pirates marauding around a core sector virtually unchallenged and which kill two of your super freighters (there goes about 3 mil each plus cargo) you start to wonder why the local fleets aren't doing anything about them???  I found myself spending so much time swatting pirates I didn't have time to finish constuction of a new complex or finish missions.  If you can automate freighters trading, why can't you have a few corvettes or a frigate set up to automatically jump in and kill pirates attacking your traders?   Yes you can set them to patrol sectors, but its a little impractical to build a combat fleet big enough to patrol the entire universe!!!An then there's some of the campaign missions.  They're a bit buggy and then sometimes they're just plain stupid.  I can ignore a mission that requires I use a TM to rescue some people even though I have other ships that will do the job better.    Or the silly campaign missions that force you to do something stupid.  Or the ones that do impossible things that leave you scratchign your head (forget how some guy got a colossus wreck at the back end of a Xenon sector, someone tell me just how did they cram all those Xenon ships in that lil cargo crate???)  But when you're presented with a sodoku puzzle which you must solve (taking 1 to 2 hours of real time) that's getting to be a bit much.  Oh an if your freighters get attacked while you're solving that puzzle.  Sorry but you you can't leave to help them or you have to start over on the puzzle (and that's not counting having my power go out just as I was about to finish solving the puzzle and had to completely start over... again).  In fact you pretty much can't do anything else while trying to solve that puzzle, which is bad in a game that frequently demands your attention.  Its just inappropriate to this type of game.Its disappointing because in many ways this game came the closest of any I've tried to being a successor to Freelancer.  It did get a lot of things right.  Large universe to sandbox in.  Trade ships move to and fro according to real supply and demand.  The economy is functional (mostly).  Interesting ship designs and some flexible options to customize them.  But with the buggy and sometimes just plain stupid campaign missions (which also fail to tell a cohesive story, oh wow some sort of giant gate hub... but um... who built it, why is it here, why aren't the xenon more interested in it, what happened to the two people who originally discovered it... who knows, none of this is explained.), and the very glitchy autopilot, the game can become very frustrating.If you've got a lot of patience and can live with those problems, there is some fun to be had.  But don't say you weren't warned about its issues and I wouldn't suggest paying full price.			"

												I may change my review to be positive later, but for now I regret the money (less than 2 hours spent.) Flight school was simple enough with a custom character (none of the premade campaigns looked that appealing.) Exploring the gates was simple enough. Encountered graphics glitches when I entered a new race's core world area. Nothing really to do with this character. Tried trading but whatever I picked up wasn't selling for any different of a price at the next 4+ depots I visited. No combat encounters. Bored.Okay, tried again. This time picked up one of the premade characters, figuring it would have more drama. Much nicer ship, faster. No prompts for any type of plot other than the flight instructor guy again. There were some hostile targets, so, I commed them and asked them to give up their cargo. They refused. I shot them. Then the police shot me. Game over. Bleh. Boring. :'( Whoever said ""Skyrim isn't as deep"" must be nuts.			"

												Maybe I didn't give enough time... but after 21h I am really bored. All the missions are the same (if you can do them, because bringing back a ship that is 20m/s is nearly impossible and it's flagged as easy) and mostly impossible to do when you start the game. You need cash to improve but can't make cash because you can't do the missions... unless you do commerce, and I can't see the point making commerce in a video game if that's for building a virtual empire.I need action and a goal, it seems that game is for people who have more than 100h to waste before having the reward to enjoy the game! Unfortunately I might have liked this game while I was a student with time to kill, but that's no longer the case. I expect a game to be ""enjoyable"" after 20h, clearly that's not the case (and forget about playing the game without a wiki to help or a full documentation open to guide you).PS : I won't talk about graphics, or strange gameplay, or glitches because I can forget that and concentrate on the real purpose of the game... getting bored for 100 of hours before being able to really play.

												Nothing about this game is straight forward and too the point.  Where do I begin, where is or was the story line?  Guess I missed that to.   Well if your looking for a game similar to rebel galaxy, freelancer or starlancer, x3 isn't it.  Maybe its me, but its all wrong, botched!  Being a merchant isn't worth bothering with when your only options are trade or barter.  Couldn't figure out how to buy or sell, cant make credits shipping goods around, have to trade or barter with other merchants to make some kind of credits, then again I couldn't figure out if your payed in creds or your recieving more useless crap.  Merchant ships don't have any weapons, or any I could figure out or find as i went through the controls.  An unarmed merchant is a dead merchant!  Graphics are horrible.  Its likely due to the fact that I haven't played alot of the older games lately, but ego soft could have done better.  I tried the terran pilot, that was just as bad if not worse, tedious and time consuming, this is how i started my game.  Go here, shoot this, scan that, blow that up, head back through the gate to someones♥♥♥♥♥♥and patrol.  Patrol for what?!  I never got paid, there was no indicator i was even looking for anything or something new was added to my mission log.(confused and flustrated look.)  Ok, so I'm not good at this game, went right over my head?  I had no clue how to play this game before I bought it and I still have absolutely no clue how to play it after I bought it.  Another problem is this game was designed to be played with a game pad.  Due to physical limitations, I can't use a game pad.  Doesn't work well with a mouse and keyboard, well it didn't for me, not sure about others.  Maybe i'll try again with no mans sky or star citizen, but If those are anything like x3 games are, I wont even bother.   Happy gaming.			"

												I´d love to play a immersive Space Opera, and i got a Tabular game for paper-shufflers.The idea of having a giant galaxy sounds great and there might be a bunch of different ships. But for 3 Reasons i cant advice the Game:1: It is ultra complicated to learn and after 200 hours of playing time it still feels like doing the computation for your tax return.2: The Storytelling of the game is like reading a cooking book.3: Everything takes ages. Even the smallest side Mission is sending you through a bunch of systems etc.. even with the time-compression its just possible to play the game while watching a film next to it.In Total:WHO THE HELL HAS THE TIME TO PLAY A GAME LIKE THIS??? I´m trying to imagine the kind of person you have to be to be amused to fly for 20 hours to a super boring Galaxy for trading MEAT PIECES!! Its just to realistic, with the boring parts of reality. damnit, if i wanna play a Game, than for Entertainement.I guess, if you are into SimCity like games and have no life, you might kinda like this Game.

												I really had high hopes for this game, believe me. However, it has failed to meet expectations in various ways. My inexperience in playing space-themed games may have caused my standard too high so I'll start off from the basics.The controls for the keyboard+mouse are absolutely terrible. For some reason everything is configured as if I am using a gamepad, which I was not. Even then, it was really hard to maneuver anywhere despite the vast emptiness of space.The minimap was complicated and too small to provide any major key objects and destinations. Luckily, they had an autopilot that would've saved my time and effort to move around. That is if the autopilot actually works. In many cases, the autopilot jerks around and just circles around 'routes', like a GPS with a very bad signal; it keeps changing directions randomly.But most importantly, the game offers little to no help in explaining basic game objectives and controls. Hence, the lack of proper tutorials early on will cause some difficulties, especially for new players. As soon as you start the game, you are immediately left alone to fight for yourself. I actually wondered around for 20 minutes before realizing that there was a quest that I haven't accepted the whole time. Despite all of the negative aspects, this game doesn't deserve to rot in hell. The space simulation is really good in my opinion. It truly shows how vast and empty space actually is, unlike how it is portrayed in popular media as being infested by giant spaceships blasting lasers everywhere. To conclude, the game need serious fixing and further development to become a fully fledged game. It really has great potential if the developers actually listen to customer feedback and at least attempt to satisfy demands.			"

												Avoid this game at all costs. There is no tutorial. You will spend hours trying to figure out stuff. Even with guides. I played hours on this game with NO return in fun. I had literally no fun in this game. I cannot stand any part of this game. Not a single aspect. Wasted hours flying around until I learned about SETA. Why doesn't the game tell you about that. Why do you need to spend hours on end discovering gates? There is no fun.			"

												Spent a little bit of time testing this out, played a couple different starting missions but the game just doesn't feel right. Combat controls feel disconnected and arbitrary and the intensely click-menu-based play system does not appeal to me. It comes across like an extremely stripped back version of some parts of EvE with all the tedious, boring bits and none of the good bits.... I love space games and have hundreds hanging on Star Citizen; was just playing this to pass the time but it's really a disappointment. A lot of reviewers fixate on the 'steep learning curve'; which I was looking forward to but it doesn't seem so much a learning curve to me as working out how to make the poorly designed UI bearable/usable. Perhaps it was ahead of it's time, and the designers had not figured out a way to make all their ideas practical? Another thing I thought was very bizarre about this game is that it has a lot of 'ship software' which doesn't really do anything - the AI is either poorly written, or overcompensated with errors to 'mimic' something....? The gamebreaker for me is that the game largely consists of travelling through space without doing anything - even with SETA on, you just spend a lot of time sitting in front of your computer waiting.... like watching a long loading screen. That is very boring to me and I don't really understand players who try and justify that. It can be designed away with by the developer being creative. Some things don't need to be simulated; like the waiting....Another amusing thing to me is that people have said that this is a good game compared to Rebirth. That must make Rebirth one of the worst games ever made in the history of computer gaming given how dull this supposedly 'vastly superior' version is! All in all, I should have just thrown the $20 I wasted on this at Star Citizen.			"

												This is just my opinion on this, i am a very casual gamer and like to play games for fun as work and real life can be testing enough, to me games are a way of blowing off steam or unwinding not a way to get even more wound up or stressed:Well, what a pile of rubbish this is. Waste of money and time. Spend the extra on Elite Dangerous which is much more approachable than this nonsense. You have to literally spend hours flying around different zones in order to find and map out the various asteroids, stations, production facilities etc, and that is even before you start to pick up missions or try your hand at trading. It comes to something where one of the main things you use in this game is something to accelerate the gameplay, that alone says enough. If you are looking for a space game where you can basically go and do whatever you fancy, be it, trading, hunting down pirates, being a pirate and so on then Elite Dangerous is where it's at. I dont know what this 'game' is trying to be but the only thing it succeeds at is being a complete waste of time.			"

												Quite honestly, this is a game for masochists. All the X games are. I don't understand how anyone likes them. The amount of painful, repetitive, boring grinding you have to do to get anywhere or do anything is worse than some MMOs. My illustrative story:After a TON of grinding back and forth, buying and selling Kahoona Steaks or whatever, I finally had enough money for a jumpdrive. A jumpdrive allows you to go from one sector to another directly, without all the painful time accelleration/gate/time acceleration/gate time sink. So I install it, and use it for the 1st time, and I'm not ♥♥♥♥♥in ya, this is what happened:""Engaging jump drive...""""Jumping in 10...""""9...""""8...""""7...""""6...""""5...""""4...""""3...""""2...""""1...""""Jump drive activated...""""Jumping.""Yes, there's a way to skip past that, but that's when I realized the X games were made by a bunch of sadists.

												Space trader sim that does not just have one steep learning curve but a series of them.  The game just drops you in at the deep end and thats your lot. Without various online faqs and walkthroughs, I simply would not have figured out what to do. The problem is that even master the basics of trade and doing missions, require a lot patient grinding. There will be no quick or easy progress through this game. At the start trading is a nightmare unless you play the ""humble merchant"". Even then the game finds ways to obstruct you progress. Missions are available but may require you to have ship upgrades that you probably were unaware of. I simply don't have the patience for a game so deep that its opaque.I can't reccomend it unless this sort of grinding and constant referring to faqs and walkthroughs is your thing.			"

												First 15 min Impressions: X3: Terran ConflictVerdict: Intelligible enough to be boringThis is the second game in my series of three. Already they've improved things for players like me!Pro: I can turn the volume up AND down!Con: I somehow accidentally select the hardest game mode while trying to figure out what the game modes are.  Exiting is impossible, ctrl-alt-delete doesn't work, and I have to resort to arcane tricks to wrest back control of my computer.Pro: An introductory cutscene I can follow! Humans are afraid of an AI singularity, so now that aliens are working on one we have to mess their♥♥♥♥♥♥up.Con: The writing is horrible, and it's not at all clear that at first they're giving us a 1000 year old story that takes place in our future.  If that sentence was hard to parse, you'll find the writing unintelligible.Pro: Tooltips now show up telling you what to do at first and where to click on the interface!Con: Only half the necessary command options are highlighted. I discovered how to open my comms and advance the plot by accidentally trying to dock with a space station.Pro: Right clicking on things brings up context sensitive actions!Con: The only action I tried, auto pilot, piloted away from the place I wanted it to go.Pro: Neptune is in danger!  I must go there immediately!Con: I spend 8 of my 15 minutes flying at top speed to a stargate that is just right over there. At one point the game froze for 15 seconds and we didn't notice.  That's how slow it was.Pro:  BATTLE!  Finally something to do!Con: Battle consists of ""keep the mouse cursor over a red dot"" while things go pew pew.  I can't see anything.  I'm bored, and other ships are complementing my bravery.  I'm offered a promotion, I think?The timer rings, and I'm released from this purgatory.			"

												""Mission timer, 12 minutes, rating: Easy""Distance between each gate?  5 minutes, 3 gates to jump.Mission, impossible.This was every starting mission I found so far, everything is impossible to do just based on time needed to make the jumps.""Mission timer, no time limit, rating: easy""The ship I have to destroy blows me out of the sky and I didn't even dent it's shields.""Mission timer, no time limit, rating: easy""Escourt mission, goes well enough, lose 60% haul during it, but I make it to the end.Both the big ships I'm escourting with dock, 2 more enemies spawn, they don't help me fight and the station wont let me dock, Get destroyed.For having so much to do, this game sure does feel empty and slogging.If you're not a space sim expert, stay away.Played over 4 hours, 0 missions completed, every one either took too much time to complete and was failed, or it was rated easy and ended up being too hard to complete.Just a note here as well.This is obviously a niche game, so a lot of people of course will enjoy it and have fun.I myself am a veteran EVE online player, so I really do like space sim type games.I just feel like this one was improperly polished and lacks a lot of interface and functions that would of made it easier to get into for new players.If you're an X series vet, you'll have a much different experience than someone new to it.But if you are new to it, don't jump into it with this game unless you watch some tutorials.

												Have you ever wanted to experience a medically induced coma? Then this is the game for you. This game could obviously have been a great hit, however for me the initial pacing was so slow that I simply lost the will to go on. The UI offers an insight into what could be complex and rewarding gameplay but for me it has to be fun; something, sadly, this game isn't. I played through the flight tutorial, the fist combat encounter and the final nail in the coffin a ""patrol"" mission. It was the ""patrol"" mission that killed the game for me. After ten minutes of flying around as my brain cells committed suicide I finally saw my adversary. After using the games fast travel to traverse 50kms to engage him, ( there's something about having the ability to jump between planets in seconds but taking FOREVER to cross trivial distances like this is a bit odd) once in range we proceeded to engage in a spectacular dog fight i.e. we flew at each other head on, passed by without managing to hit each other, swung around and tried again. And again. And again... I was able to stop my ship completely and slowly navigate through the menus looking for tips. I briefly tabed out to visit the oracle that is Google. When I got back from making a cup of tea I noticed my shields had been knocked down to about 25%. I quit the game and promptly uninstalled it. I'm sorry, I tried but this is just not for me. I like my games to be engaging and challenging but they have to be enjoyable above all else.Space games I'd suggest instead would be Kerbal Space Program, Space Engineers or Endless Space.			"

												Boring and slow-paced, this game suffers from Dwarf Fortress-itis; there is absolutely tremendous complexity hiding in this simulator, but mark my words, it is a S-I-M-U-L-A-T-O-R, not a game. The tutorial is utterly and entirely♥♥♥♥♥♥ The game fails to mention that most of the starting modes start you off without even a gun on your ship, which means you can't even complete the tutorial mission.Oh, you wanna do trading? Too bad. You *can*, but until you save up a LOT of money, you won't even know where good prices are for things unless you want to write a lot of notes manually.Look, for a game this old, this game is BEAUTIFUL. But that's all it has going for it. Would not recommend. Simulator? More like sim-you-later.			"

												There's nothing really wrong with X3 honestly. It's a solid easy to use interface and has some pretty epic dogfights. All it really lacks is a better interface for larger, slower cruisers to fight and maybe a lil more fluid inventory system (like EVE Online) but other than that it's the best out there for single player space sims.

												The learning curve scale on this game is not to be triffled with, i had to do a bit of digging on the internet to find the correct video guides/forum posts to help me fully understand the sheer scale of gameplay this game offers. It was well worth it though when i got my first universal trader auto trading goods for me, or my first space facilitiy nesseled in a quite sector producing goods to be disperesed by npc traders or myself threw the galaxy. Or when i formed my first wing formation patrol with a destroyer, 2 frigates, 4 corvettes, and 2 dozen fighters and proceded to dispense frontier justice on the outter sectors. These are all things that made the learning curve worth the effort to endure. This is not a game you re-roll in after finishing some vague plot quest, this is a game you never stop playing.			"

												I haven't been a fan of the X Series due to the never-ending bugs.  I bought this game knowing it will likely be as buggy as X2 was, and am happily surprised.  It's not what I expected, by any means.Firstly, the bugs I've noticed so far are minor, not game-ending.  The game is also incredibly deep.  It has two main roles that you can go with, combat and trade.  There's plenty of pirates who take specific targets, and Xenon who just kill anything they find.  It's not over-whelming though if you go with trade, it gives it a fun, easy challenge.  As for combat, wow, just wow.  There are all sorts of ships, from mobile mining bases that you can setup smaller ships to gather astroid stuff, large freighters, fully automated sector/universe trade ships, corvettes that will blow away smaller fighter ships like they're nothing, and even larger frigates that I haven't had the chance to play yet.  The larger ships, called capital ships, can even be boarded and taken over by marines.  It's pretty deep.The voice acting is weak, the story-line is pretty bad as well.  The best I can tell the voice actors used for the plot do not speak english fluently, the conversation seems awkward to say the least.  The main plot of the game is quite optional, so if you prefer, you can skip it.  I think it's best to skip it until you know how to fight, trade, have a couple ships with trade software 3, and maybe have built a mine or two for extra income.  Save often, you'll be very frustrated when a scout mission turns into a combat situation as you arrive 30 minutes into the mission.  There's also missions you can take from other ships and stations, they pay very well and some are rather easy.Overall, to get into this game you'll need patience.  I think the graphics are about average, nothing very special but not pixelated either.  The flow of the game is rather good, always something seeming to change subtly behind the scenes.  The sound track is pretty bad as far as the music.  Honestly I don't know about the firing sounds and such, I tend to make my own beeping noises and pshwpshw sounds and I blow things up.  Usually by the time I hit my finale of noises I get to hear the screams of a boron pilot in the background.  Again my only real complaint is the optional story-line.Overall Rating:  7/10.			"

												This is a really great game. The graphics are really nice and it runs very smoothly. My only complaints are that near the beginning, you move very slow. So you need to get more money to buy ship upgrades. The other problem I have is that the only way to save is to save is to dock at a station, which may be a little out of the way (wich takes forever near the beginning of the game). Other than that, I love the game.			"

												Great space sim with more depth than any other game I've played in years. It has a learning curve like a brick wall but you get out double what you put in. I have played it for 13 hours so far and have only scratched the surface of what the game has to offer. You can choose to do anything like be a trader, a pirate, a warlord etc etc. The game is huge with over 160 sectors and 9 different races to interact with that give you various missions.I would definitely recommend this game to anyone.

												This game is a lot of fun but has a serious learning curve due to the lack of an at length tutorial (though the first plot series acts as a short version).  There are some small issues with the game that can be overcome with modding (e.g. when connecting many stations together, FPS drops due to all the tubes running between them).

The progression curve in X3 is amazing: you start with a small fighter (sometimes lasers included!), 20h later your fleet has 1 merchant ship and you're the proud leader of a 5 fighters wing, add another 50h and you're on the bridge of your mighty carrier/destroyer storming the local pirate sector with your 50fighters/20 Incendiary Bomb Launcher.You can't imagine how epic this game is.

												X Series brings Space Simulation to the next level with enhance graphics, and more simultastic options. You have 8 pre-determined races with difficulty settings which is just how you start the game such as money+ship+reputation. Not really how hard it is. X3's space is huge, and I mean huge. You will need a fast ship if you don't want 1 hour wasted just to get to one warpgate. You get a variety of missions when you visit the stations such as ""escort, transport goods, hunt, and build a station""(Which you will need lots of money since they don't give you the station). You have to buy it then deploy it.You can also buy your own station without being mission based. Meaning you can buy ships to transport goods from one station to another,  and buy/produce battleships to wage war.. X3 is still a great game for it's depth on combat, and strategy elements. If you're craving for a good space game. Then this is the one for you. Not the new X game.			"

												Everything X3 is amazing. This is essentially a single-player MMO, and it is done so, so well. While there are elements of the X series that have always been lacking, the scale of the game has never been the problem. While there is mutliple start options, you essentially start out as a single ship working out a modest ammount of money all the way through to a fleet of ships accruing a vast ammount of wealth with a handful of massive capital ships at your disposal. The combat is challenging and fun, and has a series of different ship classes that each fill different roles, similar to an MMO such as Eve-online, but to a lesser degree. It is probably very easy to compare this game to Eve-Online as a singleplayer game. Highly recommend, definite top 10 material.			"

This is better than all of them. Besides being standard space trader it throws in station building andfleet micromanagement to a point it could also be considered an RTS underlying it all. Graphics are good, and X: Rebirth is supposed to improve on everything. Until it comes out this is definately a keeper.			"

												If you are prepared to spend at least around 15 hours to learn this game (youtube, documentation, experimentation), then this is a very good game.It is not an arcade space shooter - but a combat and trading simulator. Not fast paced. Don't even bother with using a gamepad - learn to play with the keyboard and mouse and it is a lot better that way.During my roughly 100 hours of gameplay, I experienced only a handful of crashes and corrupted save games. Other than that, the game is rock solid and looks great.There is so much to do here, and progression is really balanced - you start with only one ship and very limited scope, but eventually are able to build factories, set up automated trading ships, mine asteroids, buy large combat and commerce ships...it is great.

												X3 is a fatastic game, once you get over the steep learning curve.  Unlike other flight simulators, X3 requires you to think in 3 dimensions, not just 2.  To fly effectively you must think like a helicopter pilot.  After you master flying, the game is much more fun and accessible.  Keybinds and macros are essential, you if you have a multi-key mouse, now's the time to use it.The storeyline and depth of the game is fantastic.  You must budget, trade, wheel and deal, and be smart to survive.  To adbance takes hours of gameplay in the huge open-world style X3 offers, but the rewards are well worth the work.  If you prefer games of patience, tactics, and tenacity, this is for you.			"

												Although I am reviewing Terran Conflict, I have approximately 200hrs in between it and Albion Prelude.Simply put, if you like space shooters / simulation / strategy, this is the game you want to play, period. The gameplay is whatever you want it to be. You start off as either a merchant or mercenary, and decide what to do from there. The most impressive thing about X3 is scalability. I don't know of an example that compares to X3: Terran Conflict or Albion Prelude. There is no endgame, as you can grow yourself out to whatever lengths you like. Mods also make this game infinitely better - Terran Conflict allows for the XTM 2.0 mod, which doubles the amount of area in-game, as well as the number of spacecraft, weapons, and opportunities. The battles in the game can go from tedious to downright impressive. The largest engagement I've been a part of was a 3-way battle between Xenon, Argon, and my own mercenary squad. Approximately 500 ships were engaged in real time, spanning from scout based fighters to massive carriers and battleships - all resolving itself in real time. No other game, no matter its pitch, has managed to do what X3: TC has done in a single player game. Given the price, it's worth a try if for nothing else than  seeing how much it can remind you of Privateer or the old Tie Fighter games. At best, it'll consume hundreds of hours while you build a galaxy-spanning trillion-credit empire with your own starship factories. So fun!			"

												I've played more than 6 hours. I've somehow installed it without steam from the disc.The X series is probably one of the last bastions of true pc gaming there is. For people who understand what i just said - it's a safe buy. It's like Elite revamped revamped revamped revamped - the whole series is. Lots of technical Problems but awesome patches. Takes ages to get into, but also lasts forever. It's one of those slow hard-hitting hour sinks.If you are unsure which part of the series to get - scope out their forums. I am happy with terran conflict, but i'd get the part with the most ""fanpatch activity"". This game is basically made playable by its community almost in collaberation with the developers. An odd - hopefully everlasting - symbiosis.Also: Do not play this game on a 32-bit operating system, it will become unplayable after about 20 hours due to too much activity in the game world for your ram to handle. It's very demanding on your rig.			"

												Great game to follow in the X-Universe.I played X3: Reunion for a little while but it took too long to get a bit a cash flowing. In this game there are a lot more sub-missions and odd-jobs and they are advertised in plain view, so you don't need to land and read a bullitin board at every station.Construction stations, linking them together to form complexes, building fleets and earning cash in almost every way you can imagine in a universe that is both dynamic and full of surprises. Hint: Taking 'Return Abandoned Ship' missions are alot more profitable when delivering and selling em at a shipyard. Down-sides: * Dead-Is-Dead mode is unstable at best. Although things appear to be fine I have had ships disappearing without a trace and reason, both my own and hired. Lost a lot of cash by disappearing station carriers... * Don't rely on auto-pilot too much, I've seen myself fly into a station or asteroid plenty of times while pouring a cup 'o' coffee.			"

												X3:TC starts out as a space trading / combat game.  It's not a hugely exciting specimen of that genre, either; for example, combat tends to be a little too formulaic.  But where it really shines is when it turns into a sort of first-person fleet / empire building game -- i.e. when you start buying more ships and building your own stations.X3 lets you pilot every ship in the game, ranging from the largest destroyers and cargo lifters down to the tiniest scouts.  You can even just fly around (slowly) in your spacesuit.  Plus, it lets you own as many ships as you want, and remote control them all, or even automate them to some degree.  Want to fly a carrier and launch a fighter attack?  Want to join the fighter attack and let the AI handle the carrier?  Everything is possible.On its own, with no mods, it makes for a decent but not terribly long-term space game.  The features are there, but a lot of them have subtle problems or tricky UIs that make them tedious to use long-term.  The mods are what make it really shine -- some of them are pretty amazing, like MARS or CODEA.  The downside is, although each mod does neat stuff and takes the game in interesting directions, the mods rarely interact with each other -- this isn't like Minecraft, where mods build on each other and seamlessly plug into each other.  So you might find yourself wishing mod X (e.g. an auto-trader AI) took advantage of useful feature Y (e.g. an advanced point-to-point jumpdrive) from mod Z, but unless you go in and edit the code yourself, it never will.If you like slowly building up your space empire, X3 is a brilliant time -- up until the endgame, when some of the cracks start showing through.For example, although you can go anywhere and destroy anything, you can never eliminate some of the annoying persistent threats to your growing merchant / station fleet -- Kha'ak clusters and corvettes, pirate raids, etc.  Blow up their shipyards?  Ships keep magically spawning anyway, and the shipyards themselves reappear after a delay.Another problem is that the piloting AI isn't the greatest, particularly when dealing with larger ships and/or faster speeds.  You're liable to crash into an asteroid if you autopilot through a field of them.  In a large firefight, your giant AI destroyer might work so hard to avoid plowing through smaller fighters (which would be barely a scratch on the shields) that it ends up destroying itself against an asteroid / station / enemy ship instead -- or it just never gets where you told it to go.Out-of-sector combat (i.e. any sector you're not in) is safer because it's more abstract, and doesn't include collision detection.  But this also leads to discrepancies between your ships' combat capabilities in-sector and out-of-sector.  You might choose a perfect weapons combination that makes your ship a nigh-invulnerable powerhouse in-sector, but send it to fight out-of-sector and it could well find itself outgunned by (what ought to be) an inferior enemy due to basic math.Eventually, even this game does wear itself out, at that point when you realise you're doing increasingly tedious things just so you can say you conquered the game.  That's probably the time to stop.None of this is to say you shouldn't play it.  I've sunk almost 400 hours into X3:TC, and probably 100 hours of that was before I started modding it.  Be sure to grab the Bonus Pack from the official site, which will give you a bunch of little features that don't count as modding the game (and disable scores/achievements/etc.).  But eventually, do check out some of the more impressive mods, like MARS, XRM, etc.			"

												Great space flight simulator from a few years back. Extremely open-ended and enjoyable, even though the campaigns are kinda boring, though that doesn't hurt the fact that you can do them whenever you want to and they don't really affect your empire building.And who's bright idea was it to give pirates carriers and destroyers? Holy crap.Still a great game though. Nothing better than blowing stuff to kingdom come with a gigantic destroyer or outrunning police and military ships in a little scout. Trade. Fight. Build. Think.

												I've played more than 6 hours. I've somehow installed it without steam from the disc.The X series is probably one of the last bastions of true pc gaming there is. For people who understand what i just said - it's a safe buy. It's like Elite revamped revamped revamped revamped - the whole series is. Lots of technical Problems but awesome patches. Takes ages to get into, but also lasts forever. It's one of those slow hard-hitting hour sinks.If you are unsure which part of the series to get - scope out their forums. I am happy with terran conflict, but i'd get the part with the most ""fanpatch activity"". This game is basically made playable by its community almost in collaberation with the developers. An odd - hopefully everlasting - symbiosis.Also: Do not play this game on a 32-bit operating system, it will become unplayable after about 20 hours due to too much activity in the game world for your ram to handle. It's very demanding on your rig.			"

												My second fav X-game, Albion Prelude being my first...While Terran Conflict did have it's intial game breaking issues when first released, Egosoft quickly fixed the issues that caused the game to be unplayable at the start; After they released the patch, correcting the issues, the game quickly became my 2nd fav game. My only issue with Terran Conflict is that the Asteroids and some of the structures were too large, and caused me frame rate issues when going into particular systems.  Theres no way your going to mine all those asteroids, so I didn't feel that they needed to add so many, and so many big ones at that, just as eye candy.  Some times too much eye candy can affect game performance, and it's because of this that the game will restrict you to smaller battles unless you have the optimal system that can handle large battles, either way, it's a 32-bit application, so having more than 4 gigs of ram will not really improve your situation, as it wont' utilize any more of that ram, no matter how generous you've provided yoru system with it.With that out of the way, the game is quite fun, and rewarding...  And some game glitches were often fun to exploit, such as the time when I waped into a system, to see a Capital ship colliding with a jump gate, and slowly exploding, leaving it's valuable cargo floating in space for me to collect, not a bad haul near a fresh start of a game if I may  add.I tend to stay away from the campaigns as much as possible, and often times will look for a save game online, of someone who has completed the game, because to me, some of the missions were too challenging, and I just want to do what i want to do, and not be told what some other alien wants me to do for them.All in all I give this game an 8.5/10			"

												An awesome and very good looking sandbox game sullied by some imbalanced elemnts. You start out small with a fighter craft, some light weaponry, and 10k credits but you have the potential to pilot your own personal kilometer long destroyer, own many spacestations, trade fleets, fighter wings and much more. Trading, Fighting, Pirating, completing missions, and evntually building your own space stations to manufacture and sell products is awesome until you discover how easy it is to get rich by doing simple missions or nvidium mining. Trading goods personally is a waste of time by comparison when you get paid millions to effortlessly off some pirate whose exact location is given to you. You can always use a mod or just abstain from missions to be fair but it still takes a lot away from an otherwise excellent game.			"

												I've played this game for a while years ago, I didn't like it back then.Now recentely I have revisited the game thanks to a steam sale.This was an awesome idea! Do not let the learning curve put you off the game. Turns out I ditched the game just after the learning curve. I'm now 50+hrs in to my first game, having built a nive financial empire and just starting to take on story missions.While being a pretty deep economics sim (I started out as a humble trader), It has some fun action scenes too, after you get a couple of equipped ships going.While I am mainly a role playing person this combines all the right elements I personally love. I can highly reccomend this version over the latest iteration, Rebirth. "

												TLDR: Don't buy it. Amazing game but eventually all savegames will corrupt and there's no way of getting them back forcing you to start over from a really old savegame or scratch.Actual review:First off, I love this game and have spent most of my game hours directly off of the non-steam version. I have all starts unlocked and have finished all the major plots. I only switched to steam because I thought it was more stable. Boy was I wrong. I would totally recommend this game if not for one major flaw: Save game corruption. Every save I've had eventually corrupts without fail and Egosoft's support forums are littered with reports of the same thing. The general response has been to either verify your game cache or to reinstall updates. If that doesn't work then guess what? You're screwed. Most players respond with statements such as. ""Oh you lost a few days? I lost weeks of gameplay, so it's not that bad."" Moderators always respond with ""it's one of your drivers/your system's fault."" So how do you prevent it? There are 3 possible ways that are in no way garunteed to work at all : 1 . Some people recommend turning off anti virus software as it's known to corrupt saves. I won't even go into how ridiculous this is...  2. Not doing the main plots -as they're known to cause glitches- so goodbye player HQ and personal hub as well as special ships and access to new sectors. 3. To doing what's called a rolling save. Basically saving in all of your save slots for one game and saving 1-2 slots that you only save over after the end of each play session. This still has a chance of causing corrupt saves, most people have to use a mod to save their game. So goodbye steam achievements. Not to mention the fact that autosaves are known to cause savegame corruptions and any ship larger than an m6 can't dock at a regular station, so you're forced to buy salvage insurance to even save. At 3k a pop and having to save at least 3 times every hour this depletes your hard earned credits fast. I could actually get past these issues if not for one reason: I've never had this problem with any other game ever except this one. But when you ask Egosoft, there's nothing wrong with the game at all it's all on the player's end. Somehow, I seriously doubt that. When it's a common occurance in a game that's all about taking weeks to build an empire for a players saves to corrupt and there's no way to fix it I ask this: Why should anyone buy your software?

												One very strange and huge game.If you like the thought of a slow paced sci-fi universe simulator with the potential for extreme micro-management, then this is probably the game for you!It has a few flaws...The start scenario I went for dumped me a mere 21 sector jumps away from the start of the main plot line. There is no in game help / hint to guide you on this one. I only found out because eventually I looked on the wiki to see how to start the main quest line.I clocked up around 50 hours of game play before I even knew how or where to start the main quest line, and I only found that out from a wiki. Just pause on that one for a second and try and think of any other game that happens.The game will happily offer you missions you can't complete because you don't have the equipment for them. Occasionally you don't find out you don't have the right equipment until you've reached the end of the mission, at which point you may as well load the last saved game and try something else. If you just followed someone across many sectors at <100m/s to find that out .. you may not want to play x3 for a few days.The auto-pilot is a little derpy. It's not too bad in the smaller station systems, but probably can and will kill you trying to get around the massive Terran stations. In fact the massive Terran stations are so big (and the auto-pilot so derpy) that I've managed to entirely miss combat scenarios because by the time my ship had got around the space station, they'd all been shot down. It takes that long.In most start scenarios, you start in a pitifully underpowered ship. It's so bad that to begin with, even completing the easiest combat missions is tricky, and you can ignore 99% of the other missions because you don't have life support cargo or the money needed to do them. I can see that aspect putting a lot of people off. The beginning is just a horrible grind with none of the upgrades to make it more bearable, and not enough cargo space or cash to make trading profitable.So what do you do? Go wiki hunting. Find some abandoned ships, get them, sell or equip them, and begin to get a slight grip on the game. Noteworthy: This is a game you will almost certainly give up on if you don't read the wiki, and if you consider grabbing a few abandoned ships via the wiki as cheating .. then you will probably give up if you don't cheat.If you ignore all that, there is a vast, complex universe out there waiting for you to spend hours and hours carefully constructing your own empire and fleets of ships. That's your basic deal with this game. Flawed & slow vs. a lot of potential for detailed (slow) space empire building.I'm not sure if I like it or not, but I do load it up from time to time and get a little further.Note: My hours look low on Steam for this game, because I don't run Steam to play it.

Have migrated X3TC from App Store Mac version to Steam Mac all thanks to a farsighted Egosoft decision to enable this game on this platform. Thanks to them for that. Oh and thanks for getting the brilliant graphics to work on Open GL and OSX, a factor which spoils many games, sadly.I see this has posted with 0.5 hours playtime but have been playing it on the Mac App store version for over three years so I reckon several hundred hours might be closer.

												God aweful interface....But once you get used to/change every single default control to something you find more comfortable this game has ALOT to offer. I never realized just how little the average game really lets you do. That is until I played this(and skyrim).I do warn that this game requires many many many hours to make progress, mainly because flying through space is exactly how it should be.(slow and sometimes tricky) I required a walkthrough to get anywhere early game, as inexperienced players will be hit with ALOT of information at the start. But once you get a couple ships under your control the game moves much more smoothly and managing your fleet helps pass the time as you fly from one end of the universe to the next doing whatever it is you feel like doing.Quick list of a small fraction of the styles of game you could play while in the X3 universe.-Savvy trader-Space pirate-Police figure-Fighter pilot-Illegal goods runner-Passanger carrier-Space station transporter-Investigator-Mining vessel-Space station manager-And so much freaking more.And you can control as many ships as you like, so you can actually mix and match these playstyles, as well as try to do everything! Not only is there a huge range of playstyles to be had, there are a number of factions to start from, so the replayability is endless as you form/break/manipulate trust with the different factions organically and naturally.I played as a merchant trader, using huge transport ships to carry my cargos around from sector to sector, while using smaller ships to protect them. I controlled those ships from my personal craft which I'd modified to be a rum runner as I carried illegal alcohol dashing passed police forces to get paid massively for each run. Oh, and I had a space station.... And docking at your own personal space station never gets dull.			"

												I'll try and keep this short and sweet. If you like space simulators, if you LOVE a challenge, if you like being immersed in a large universe, THEN BUY THIS GAME!Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude, both can be bought as a pack, then get the bonus pack (free DLC) scripts from the start.This Game IS difficult to get your head around with the complexities. You will die/reload/die/reload then realise you're trying to do a mission that's too hard for your current ship/loadout. Read the tips from support wiki's and forums - they are REALLY helpful and explain so much.It takes TIME to get ahead, but don't be discouraged!!!!!! I only playedd this game 16hrs to begin with (from memory). Then I let it sit for a year or two. Now, having just got back into it I have 70hrs more experience and I realise I will rule the empire, one day....not tomorrow, or next week, but it will be a long rewarding journey.May the force be...err, sorry, copyright laws and such. Good luck! "

												Great if you like Space Sims. Real steep learning curve though. I have been playing for 9 hours and still haven't hardly made it off the ground yet. The game has huge potential for more than just flying around and blowing things up. There is a huge universe to explore and a complex trading and empire building side to the game. Anyone that likes being able to build an empire and start to expand through a huge universe will more than likely love this game. Be a trader and find the best deals through sectors, be a fighter pilot and kill pirates left and right, be a pirate and raid those pesky fighters and their trader friends, be a business man and form your own empire starting with one station and building up, be the commander of an entire fleet of ships ranging from Giant M1 class cruisers to small M5 scout fighters. The choice is up to you.			"

												TLDR: Don't buy it. Amazing game but eventually all savegames will corrupt and there's no way of getting them back forcing you to start over from a really old savegame or scratch.Actual review:First off, I love this game and have spent most of my game hours directly off of the non-steam version. I have all starts unlocked and have finished all the major plots. I only switched to steam because I thought it was more stable. Boy was I wrong. I would totally recommend this game if not for one major flaw: Save game corruption. Every save I've had eventually corrupts without fail and Egosoft's support forums are littered with reports of the same thing. The general response has been to either verify your game cache or to reinstall updates. If that doesn't work then guess what? You're screwed. Most players respond with statements such as. ""Oh you lost a few days? I lost weeks of gameplay, so it's not that bad."" Moderators always respond with ""it's one of your drivers/your system's fault."" So how do you prevent it? There are 3 possible ways that are in no way garunteed to work at all : 1 . Some people recommend turning off anti virus software as it's known to corrupt saves. I won't even go into how ridiculous this is...  2. Not doing the main plots -as they're known to cause glitches- so goodbye player HQ and personal hub as well as special ships and access to new sectors. 3. To doing what's called a rolling save. Basically saving in all of your save slots for one game and saving 1-2 slots that you only save over after the end of each play session. This still has a chance of causing corrupt saves, most people have to use a mod to save their game. So goodbye steam achievements. Not to mention the fact that autosaves are known to cause savegame corruptions and any ship larger than an m6 can't dock at a regular station, so you're forced to buy salvage insurance to even save. At 3k a pop and having to save at least 3 times every hour this depletes your hard earned credits fast. I could actually get past these issues if not for one reason: I've never had this problem with any other game ever except this one. But when you ask Egosoft, there's nothing wrong with the game at all it's all on the player's end. Somehow, I seriously doubt that. When it's a common occurance in a game that's all about taking weeks to build an empire for a players saves to corrupt and there's no way to fix it I ask this: Why should anyone buy your software?

I'd recommend having it window mode and reading the forums/wiki's to help you get along. 70 Hours ofplay time  in I've built factories, stolen ships and taken part in a large unscripted fight that I just fell into and I'm barely even started.You can compress time to speed things up to x1000 as such I currently have about 10 days of actual game time in the game.This is all using an unmodded ""original"" game, the scripts/mods that are available add even more depth.

Reccomended to any with an interest of space sims/sci-fi games. It also has the potential for MASSIVE fights involving dozens or hundreds of fighters, transports, cruisers, stations and captitol ships.Be aware that this game has a steep learning curve, however, and the combat system is strict and unforgiving. Some parts of the game, such as liberating ships and collecting cargo are a bit clunky, but are understandable in context.Despite these flaws, this manages to be one of the best space games of all time.Overall: 8.9/10			"

I wouldn't recommend any of the previous X games from the series as Terran Conflict is the best and the rest are mere shadows by comparison. As an added incentive, X3TC also has what is arguably the most imaginative and largest modding community of any PC game. I would even say that this game has more professionally done mods available than more commonly known classic multiplayer games such as counter-strike (entirely different gaming genre, yes... but a mod is a mod is a mod).

												God aweful interface....But once you get used to/change every single default control to something you find more comfortable this game has ALOT to offer. I never realized just how little the average game really lets you do. That is until I played this(and skyrim).I do warn that this game requires many many many hours to make progress, mainly because flying through space is exactly how it should be.(slow and sometimes tricky) I required a walkthrough to get anywhere early game, as inexperienced players will be hit with ALOT of information at the start. But once you get a couple ships under your control the game moves much more smoothly and managing your fleet helps pass the time as you fly from one end of the universe to the next doing whatever it is you feel like doing.Quick list of a small fraction of the styles of game you could play while in the X3 universe.-Savvy trader-Space pirate-Police figure-Fighter pilot-Illegal goods runner-Passanger carrier-Space station transporter-Investigator-Mining vessel-Space station manager-And so much freaking more.And you can control as many ships as you like, so you can actually mix and match these playstyles, as well as try to do everything! Not only is there a huge range of playstyles to be had, there are a number of factions to start from, so the replayability is endless as you form/break/manipulate trust with the different factions organically and naturally.I played as a merchant trader, using huge transport ships to carry my cargos around from sector to sector, while using smaller ships to protect them. I controlled those ships from my personal craft which I'd modified to be a rum runner as I carried illegal alcohol dashing passed police forces to get paid massively for each run. Oh, and I had a space station.... And docking at your own personal space station never gets dull.			"

												Sounds great, and the combat isn't too bad.  But the rest of the game is very boring.  10-15 minutes of flying from gate-to-gate, to get to one battle.  You can only save the game while docked at a station, so when you load your saved game, you have to go fly back through all those gates to get to the same batle if you want to try again.			"

												It's all been said before, a brilliant immersive game that has a multitude of perspectives. Dip in for an hour, two, more ... or just for a short break to escape all the other stuff the world loads on your shoulders. Have migrated X3TC from App Store Mac version to Steam Mac all thanks to a farsighted Egosoft decision to enable this game on this platform. Thanks to them for that. Oh and thanks for getting the brilliant graphics to work on Open GL and OSX, a factor which spoils many games, sadly.I see this has posted with 0.5 hours playtime but have been playing it on the Mac App store version for over three years so I reckon several hundred hours might be closer.

												Exellent space simulator, builder and I call it a 4x but got bannd for it at a certain site. :) I like it it's fun it just take awhile to build up a fleet and get going but very enjoyable and emmersive.It's HIGHLY better than DISTANT WORLDS in all kinds of ways. Even the AI is better than DIstant worlds as passive as it is. The Xenon are still better to fight against than ALL the races in Distant Worlds.Plus, this game gives you a simulator as well as 4x. You get to build things and buy fleets and command them as well from your own personal command ship which can be ANY ship in your armada. From a transport to a huge factory transport ship to any regular fleet ship. This is one of the greatest poiints about the game that you get to command an armada not just ONE ship.There are mods galore that add to the game. You can get mods that will auto replenish your ships when they run out of ammo or missiles. You can get ships to stock NEW ships that you build even in a FLEET they will stock the WHOLE fleet with weapons an other things those ships might need.It's just a joy to play. Much MUCH better than DISTANT WORLDS in EVERY apsect.Buy it you will like it and be glad you did. And if your're thinking about getting Distant Worlds, don't because talk about boring it's the boringest I ever played.			"

												Everything X3 is amazing. This is essentially a single-player MMO, and it is done so, so well. While there are elements of the X series that have always been lacking, the scale of the game has never been the problem. While there is mutliple start options, you essentially start out as a single ship working out a modest ammount of money all the way through to a fleet of ships accruing a vast ammount of wealth with a handful of massive capital ships at your disposal. The combat is challenging and fun, and has a series of different ship classes that each fill different roles, similar to an MMO such as Eve-online, but to a lesser degree. It is probably very easy to compare this game to Eve-Online as a singleplayer game. Highly recommend, definite top 10 material.			"

												Reading the instruction manual is highly recommended. Check your steam folder, usually \Steam\steamapps\common\X3 Terran Conflict\Documents\x3tc_manual_us_low_online.pdfThe difficulty curve is fairly high and while there is a tutorial set of quests you are free to do as you wish once you load up the game. Learn how to manage travel in order to not be scared away by potentially long travel times. If you like trading empire games this is probably one of the best games out there, starting from a lowly ship and becoming one of the largest companies in the universe. You can also be a pirate or do other combat style gameplay but to be honest there are other games that handle combat in better ways.			"

												X3 is a fatastic game, once you get over the steep learning curve.  Unlike other flight simulators, X3 requires you to think in 3 dimensions, not just 2.  To fly effectively you must think like a helicopter pilot.  After you master flying, the game is much more fun and accessible.  Keybinds and macros are essential, you if you have a multi-key mouse, now's the time to use it.The storeyline and depth of the game is fantastic.  You must budget, trade, wheel and deal, and be smart to survive.  To adbance takes hours of gameplay in the huge open-world style X3 offers, but the rewards are well worth the work.  If you prefer games of patience, tactics, and tenacity, this is for you.			"

												The best space simulator ever. EVE Online is a joke compared to this game. Besides blowing up♥♥♥♥♥♥in your spaceship, you can be a pirate and hijack other ships. Build space stations to create resources. Distribute your resources using cargo ships to other stations that need them, working supply and demand so you get the best price. Buy shares in a corporation, then use your fleet to destroy their rival and watch that corporation flourish and your stock skyrocket. The music tracks are great and blend well with the full space exploration theme.There's a lot to do but my only gripe is the voice-overs are dated, the npc models are a joke, missions get repetetive, and the worst is when 1,000 ships are on screen at once during a battle your frame rate crawls to a stop - unless you got a good cpu.

												Although I am reviewing Terran Conflict, I have approximately 200hrs in between it and Albion Prelude.Simply put, if you like space shooters / simulation / strategy, this is the game you want to play, period. The gameplay is whatever you want it to be. You start off as either a merchant or mercenary, and decide what to do from there. The most impressive thing about X3 is scalability. I don't know of an example that compares to X3: Terran Conflict or Albion Prelude. There is no endgame, as you can grow yourself out to whatever lengths you like. Mods also make this game infinitely better - Terran Conflict allows for the XTM 2.0 mod, which doubles the amount of area in-game, as well as the number of spacecraft, weapons, and opportunities. The battles in the game can go from tedious to downright impressive. The largest engagement I've been a part of was a 3-way battle between Xenon, Argon, and my own mercenary squad. Approximately 500 ships were engaged in real time, spanning from scout based fighters to massive carriers and battleships - all resolving itself in real time. No other game, no matter its pitch, has managed to do what X3: TC has done in a single player game. Given the price, it's worth a try if for nothing else than  seeing how much it can remind you of Privateer or the old Tie Fighter games. At best, it'll consume hundreds of hours while you build a galaxy-spanning trillion-credit empire with your own starship factories. So fun!			"

												Ignore my play time, it says in the actual game that I have 300+ hours — so I know a bit about Terran Conflict.You'll need some patience for this game — a lot of it. Travel times are slow, getting money is slow (unless you use the nividium ""exploit"" aka cheat), and the storyline is slow. With that said...This game is amazing. The universe is absolutely massive, with something like 200+ star systems. There are 9 or 10 races and several factions, each with their own unique characteristics. There are hundreds of different classes of ships and stations to purchase or steal, and thousands of AI vessels to obtain missions from or fight. There are also multiple storylines; you could get dozens of gameplay hours out of them alone. And if that's not enough, there's plenty of modding support out there on the internet.So to sum it up, this is a slow-paced game, with a few glitches here and there, but annihilating an entire fleet of Xenon ships and destoying their stations out of vengeance for the destruction of your Mercury freighter (after you didn't notice the ""your ship was destroyed by Xenon K"" message and autosaved over the top several times after telling the freighter to buy ware for best price at which point it decided to go through the Xenon sector to get energy cells for 20 credits because it's unintelligent and then it died) makes X3: Terran Conflict totally worth every SETA'd minute.Not to mention the space cows.10/10			"

												To put it short this game is an awesome four X space sim. This game allows you to fly ships ranging from small scout ships to large freighters all the way to capital sized ships that are 100x larger then the small ships with the fire power to destory space stations in a few minutes. Space combat isn't the only feature in this game since you can build a trade empire, build a large fleet that rivals the major factions' armies, or just explore this large universe and completing the major story missions. If you've been looking for a game like this and you have plenty of free time this is a must play game since it allows you to do so much. This game is slow paced outside of combat and it isn't without its flaws but as I said it is an awesome game if this is something you've been looking for, so I recommend this game.			"

You have to dedicate in search for information in foruns and other resources to fully understand how to explore every possibility in this game. I Like the idea that you start small and by trading, doing missions and crafting you can build an empire. And the exploration is another point that I like in this game. You have to jump gates and discover other locations, some inhabitated for alies or foes, with its stations, ships that you can trade. This game has an active community and lots of ideas to try.

If you somehow learn all details, you can pretty much do everything.Trading goods..... checkBuilding your fleet.... checkConstructing your industrial empire.... checkMissions.... checkDestroying everything.... checkI had a lot of fun with this game, but I have to agree with many negative reviews as well. I could have easily be on the other side if I didn't spend the time to learn (something that I never do except this) about the game. If you don't have time or want something to play right away, avoid this game like a plague. It will be wasting your money regardless of how cheap the price is. If you have time and you are willing to learn about the game, then you might be enjoying it.			"

												One very strange and huge game.If you like the thought of a slow paced sci-fi universe simulator with the potential for extreme micro-management, then this is probably the game for you!It has a few flaws...The start scenario I went for dumped me a mere 21 sector jumps away from the start of the main plot line. There is no in game help / hint to guide you on this one. I only found out because eventually I looked on the wiki to see how to start the main quest line.I clocked up around 50 hours of game play before I even knew how or where to start the main quest line, and I only found that out from a wiki. Just pause on that one for a second and try and think of any other game that happens.The game will happily offer you missions you can't complete because you don't have the equipment for them. Occasionally you don't find out you don't have the right equipment until you've reached the end of the mission, at which point you may as well load the last saved game and try something else. If you just followed someone across many sectors at <100m/s to find that out .. you may not want to play x3 for a few days.The auto-pilot is a little derpy. It's not too bad in the smaller station systems, but probably can and will kill you trying to get around the massive Terran stations. In fact the massive Terran stations are so big (and the auto-pilot so derpy) that I've managed to entirely miss combat scenarios because by the time my ship had got around the space station, they'd all been shot down. It takes that long.In most start scenarios, you start in a pitifully underpowered ship. It's so bad that to begin with, even completing the easiest combat missions is tricky, and you can ignore 99% of the other missions because you don't have life support cargo or the money needed to do them. I can see that aspect putting a lot of people off. The beginning is just a horrible grind with none of the upgrades to make it more bearable, and not enough cargo space or cash to make trading profitable.So what do you do? Go wiki hunting. Find some abandoned ships, get them, sell or equip them, and begin to get a slight grip on the game. Noteworthy: This is a game you will almost certainly give up on if you don't read the wiki, and if you consider grabbing a few abandoned ships via the wiki as cheating .. then you will probably give up if you don't cheat.If you ignore all that, there is a vast, complex universe out there waiting for you to spend hours and hours carefully constructing your own empire and fleets of ships. That's your basic deal with this game. Flawed & slow vs. a lot of potential for detailed (slow) space empire building.I'm not sure if I like it or not, but I do load it up from time to time and get a little further.Note: My hours look low on Steam for this game, because I don't run Steam to play it.

												Hands down the best space sandbox game i have ever played and overall one of my favorite games of all time. I have easily played hundreds of hours as i previously owned it before acquiring it on steam.  It does take some effort to learn.  One of the things i loved the most was trying to get pirates to eject from their ships so that i could take possession, building a base and trying to get one of every ship, building factories,  building and maintaining a huge fleet of traders. This game has so much depth.  So dissapointed with the latest game it literally broke my heart :(			"

												If you are prepared to spend at least around 15 hours to learn this game (youtube, documentation, experimentation), then this is a very good game.It is not an arcade space shooter - but a combat and trading simulator. Not fast paced. Don't even bother with using a gamepad - learn to play with the keyboard and mouse and it is a lot better that way.During my roughly 100 hours of gameplay, I experienced only a handful of crashes and corrupted save games. Other than that, the game is rock solid and looks great.There is so much to do here, and progression is really balanced - you start with only one ship and very limited scope, but eventually are able to build factories, set up automated trading ships, mine asteroids, buy large combat and commerce ships...it is great.

												X3 is a fatastic game, once you get over the steep learning curve.  Unlike other flight simulators, X3 requires you to think in 3 dimensions, not just 2.  To fly effectively you must think like a helicopter pilot.  After you master flying, the game is much more fun and accessible.  Keybinds and macros are essential, you if you have a multi-key mouse, now's the time to use it.The storeyline and depth of the game is fantastic.  You must budget, trade, wheel and deal, and be smart to survive.  To adbance takes hours of gameplay in the huge open-world style X3 offers, but the rewards are well worth the work.  If you prefer games of patience, tactics, and tenacity, this is for you.			"

You have to jump gates and discover other locations, some inhabitated for alies or foes, with its stations, ships that you can trade. This game has an active community and lots of ideas to try.

I wouldn't recommend any of the previous X games from the series as Terran Conflict is the best and the rest are mere shadows by comparison. As an added incentive, X3TC also has what is arguably the most imaginative and largest modding community of any PC game. I would even say that this game has more professionally done mods available than more commonly known classic multiplayer games such as counter-strike (entirely different gaming genre, yes... but a mod is a mod is a mod).

The game has huge potential for more than just flying around and blowing things up. There is a huge universe to explore and a complex trading and empire building side to the game. Anyone that likes being able to build an empire and start to expand through a huge universe will more than likely love this game. Be a trader and find the best deals through sectors, be a fighter pilot and kill pirates left and right, be a pirate and raid those pesky fighters and their trader friends, be a business man and form your own empire starting with one station and building up, be the commander of an entire fleet of ships ranging from Giant M1 class cruisers to small M5 scout fighters.

You start out small with a fighter craft, some light weaponry, and 10k credits but you have the potential to pilot your own personal kilometer long destroyer, own many spacestations, trade fleets, fighter wings and much more. Trading, Fighting, Pirating, completing missions, and evntually building your own space stations to manufacture and sell products is awesome until you discover how easy it is to get rich by doing simple missions or nvidium mining. Trading goods personally is a waste of time by comparison when you get paid millions to effortlessly off some pirate whose exact location is given to you. You can always use a mod or just abstain from missions to be fair but it still takes a lot away from an otherwise excellent game.			"

												My second fav X-game, Albion Prelude being my first...While Terran Conflict did have it's intial game breaking issues when first released, Egosoft quickly fixed the issues that caused the game to be unplayable at the start; After they released the patch, correcting the issues, the game quickly became my 2nd fav game. My only issue with Terran Conflict is that the Asteroids and some of the structures were too large, and caused me frame rate issues when going into particular systems.  Theres no way your going to mine all those asteroids, so I didn't feel that they needed to add so many, and so many big ones at that, just as eye candy.  Some times too much eye candy can affect game performance, and it's because of this that the game will restrict you to smaller battles unless you have the optimal system that can handle large battles, either way, it's a 32-bit application, so having more than 4 gigs of ram will not really improve your situation, as it wont' utilize any more of that ram, no matter how generous you've provided yoru system with it.With that out of the way, the game is quite fun, and rewarding...  And some game glitches were often fun to exploit, such as the time when I waped into a system, to see a Capital ship colliding with a jump gate, and slowly exploding, leaving it's valuable cargo floating in space for me to collect, not a bad haul near a fresh start of a game if I may  add.I tend to stay away from the campaigns as much as possible, and often times will look for a save game online, of someone who has completed the game, because to me, some of the missions were too challenging, and I just want to do what i want to do, and not be told what some other alien wants me to do for them.All in all I give this game an 8.5/10			"

If you like space simulators, if you LOVE a challenge, if you like being immersed in a large universe, THEN BUY THIS GAME!Terran Conflict and Albion Prelude, both can be bought as a pack, then get the bonus pack (free DLC) scripts from the start.This Game IS difficult to get your head around with the complexities. You will die/reload/die/reload then realise you're trying to do a mission that's too hard for your current ship/loadout. Read the tips from support wiki's and forums - they are REALLY helpful and explain so much.It takes TIME to get ahead, but don't be discouraged!!!!!! I only playedd this game 16hrs to begin with (from memory). Then I let it sit for a year or two. Now, having just got back into it I have 70hrs more experience and I realise I will rule the empire, one day....not tomorrow, or next week, but it will be a long rewarding journey.May the force be...err, sorry, copyright laws and such. Good luck! "

												If You love scifi, sandbox, or even non-time restrictive style play. This game is for you. Play how you want to. Do what you want to. I got it because it reminded me of the MMO, EVE Online. It's no EVE but the single player emersion this game offers. I have yet to come across till now. If your bored of playing MMO's or your run of the mill scifi ship shooters, and just want to relax. Take your time, plan, build, strategize (wing managment), mine, create wealth through trade, and/or just blow stuff up. At the pace you want to, under no set of guide lines, and in no order at all.............THEN HAVE FUN!!! This game is a great investment.			"

												The scale and scope of this epic game are incredible. I'll gladly conceed that this game isn't for everyone. It demands a heavy investment of time, but the rewards are so great for all of that. You start the game with a basic ship, enough currency to basically last your first 15 minutes (if you are frugal) and set loose in a galaxy. What will you do? Join the military? Become a trader? Work up to a station and trade? a pirate?The good news is you can do all these things!If you are looking for a casual game to kill 15 minutes while you wait for your bus, look elsewhere. If you want to spend months slowly building an empire to rival the largest corporations in the galaxy, with a fleet of freighters that number in the hundreds, and a personal amada that can jump into any sector and lay waste to everything it encounters, all while feeling a bit gushy over the amazing graphics, then THIS title is for you.

												If you are prepared to spend at least around 15 hours to learn this game (youtube, documentation, experimentation), then this is a very good game.It is not an arcade space shooter - but a combat and trading simulator. Not fast paced. Don't even bother with using a gamepad - learn to play with the keyboard and mouse and it is a lot better that way.During my roughly 100 hours of gameplay, I experienced only a handful of crashes and corrupted save games. Other than that, the game is rock solid and looks great.There is so much to do here, and progression is really balanced - you start with only one ship and very limited scope, but eventually are able to build factories, set up automated trading ships, mine asteroids, buy large combat and commerce ships...it is great.

												Despite an initial ""What do I do now?"" feeling you get upon starting, I found myself sucked deep into  this game's massive universe and complexities. If you like EVE Online, but want to play offline, or just enjoy Space Sims in general, this one feels well placed. Beware however, because this game has a steep learning curve, and might require some research or experimentation to truly figure out what to do after being left high and dry post flight instructions. I give this game 4 Daleks out of 5.			"

All around fantastic space sim, with a level of complexity that will keep the detail minded entertained for a long long time. And enough content and freedom to keep you interested, awesome sandbox game, if you like Eve, but don't like the people that play it the X series is a great alternative.			"

												The game is decent. It is an extremely slow burner and will take a hundred or more hours before the real fun starts. But there are various problems. For starter, the AI is extremely poor, as automated ships will destroy themselves  by crashing into a station or an asteroid because pathfinding is too hard for them. Fleet control is poor, so much so that you would really rather simply pilot your own ship and do most of the fighting yourself (this is not Homeworld or Sins of a Solar Empire). The method of organizing fleets is clunky and stale and trying to get a fleet through a gate will end in heavy casualties crashing into each other. Physics is also a problem. Tutorials are left wanting and presentation of the game is poor, as it is mostly buried in menus and submenus. Voice acting is downright atrociouss. Graphics are very dated. The plot missions will take even more time. If after all this, you still want a good space simulator with the ability to craft your own empire then this game is for you. Just don't expect a fleshed out fleet control simulator.			"

												This is an excelent sandbox game. But have a steep learning curve. You have to dedicate in search for information in foruns and other resources to fully understand how to explore every possibility in this game. I Like the idea that you start small and by trading, doing missions and crafting you can build an empire. And the exploration is another point that I like in this game. You have to jump gates and discover other locations, some inhabitated for alies or foes, with its stations, ships that you can trade. This game has an active community and lots of ideas to try. Recommended.			"

												It is a good game, if you can somehow pass its steep learning curve. Like many others said already, there is minimal tutorial, which is probably the worst aspect that you can expect from this type of sim game. If you somehow learn all details, you can pretty much do everything.Trading goods..... checkBuilding your fleet.... checkConstructing your industrial empire.... checkMissions.... checkDestroying everything.... checkI had a lot of fun with this game, but I have to agree with many negative reviews as well. I could have easily be on the other side if I didn't spend the time to learn (something that I never do except this) about the game. If you don't have time or want something to play right away, avoid this game like a plague. It will be wasting your money regardless of how cheap the price is. If you have time and you are willing to learn about the game, then you might be enjoying it.			"

												Back from the times when Egosoft not only made good games but also was the only space-sim developer out there. It's an intelectually racist game, and that's what makes it so good. The learning curve is steep but if you afford some time to learn it, you'll find out that the posibilities are enormous and with the addition of mods, unlimited. The World is gigantic, the economy is incredibly detailed, and combat is fun as well as surprisingly realistic physics-wise. It is extremely hardcore for the beginers but it is also an incredibly rewarding experience.			"

												The learning curve scale on this game is not to be triffled with, i had to do a bit of digging on the internet to find the correct video guides/forum posts to help me fully understand the sheer scale of gameplay this game offers. It was well worth it though when i got my first universal trader auto trading goods for me, or my first space facilitiy nesseled in a quite sector producing goods to be disperesed by npc traders or myself threw the galaxy. Or when i formed my first wing formation patrol with a destroyer, 2 frigates, 4 corvettes, and 2 dozen fighters and proceded to dispense frontier justice on the outter sectors. These are all things that made the learning curve worth the effort to endure. This is not a game you re-roll in after finishing some vague plot quest, this is a game you never stop playing.			"

												Best of the series, it's an open-world space RPG, with plotlines as well.  It's quirky and imperfect, as all ""do whatever you want, play however you want"" games are, but this achieves more of that unachievable goal than any other I've found.Enjoyable combat at multiple scales (small fighter, mid-sized, capital), practical industrialist gameplay (build in-space factories, connected by pipes, and/or using semi-automated freighters to ferry supplies or buy/sell the ingredients & products), many different ship, weapon, and expendable (missile, etc) types and tradeoffs, and so on.The game's engine has a lot of quirks and oddities left over from it's several predecessors, particularly the original game in the series.  That may be a problem for you, or that may just be part of its unique flavor or retro elements.An impressive game in a quality series (X3:TC and X3:AP are the high points), particularly for a game (and franchise) you've never heard of.

												Not so much a learning curve as a steep cliff.  However once you get over the cumbersome interface, you have a really sharp space sim with some fun quest lines.  Fighter combat is great, but you'll have to upgrade to capital ships or at least a corvette eventually because of scaling.  Lots of fun to be had designing and building your commercial empire or just go Xenon hunting.  Some bits are marred by boring grinding like the Hub quest-line and getting your marines to 5 stars.

So grab yourself this gem of a game series & hope you have tons of fun buying & selling your way to the top of the game.			"

												Fantastic space game. You can play as a fighter or a trader, or mix both. I've played it through a couple of times and will again. There's nothing quite as satisfying as seeing the cash roll in from a galactic trading empire of factories which one has built oneself. The GUI could be improved and is clunky in places (especially the map), and the tutorial doesn't always work properly, but oneline walkthroughs exist to help with that and the parts of the plots where the next step is not obvious.With a little more polish, this would be a perfect game.

												Good, 'professional' (steep learning curve, needs to invest many hours on learning/ playing) space sim. Always singleplayer franchise under a massive sandbox universe, with sure sequels to come. That is: a game you can play for maybe a lifetime :-0, since familiarizing with one of them will get you into the other franchise games, each with hundred of gameplay hours. So for the ones which are fans of the genre interested on endless singleplayer gaming where you can do pretty much anything ('trade, think, explore, combat') a sure bet for infinite space wandering (just remember once in a while you do have a real life to take care of!). To sum it up: takes some time to learn, entry cost for lifetime spacefaring. Don't get lost in space! For the ones interested on a similar albeit multiplayer experience there's the 'EVE Online' game which provides a similarly huge, endless exploitable world (subscription-based).			"

												You need to understand that this is NOT an insta-win game..this is a space trade combat flight sim that can and will pull you in if you give it the chance. This game is the ultimate in empire building and extremely sandbox. The plots are in the game to give you something else to do but are definately worth the time for the rewards. If you do decide to try this game you need to remember that this game has a very steep learning curve. However the player community is the best I have ever had the pleasure of dealing with. Ask a question on the egosoft.com forums and you will have extremely fast, intelligent, and friendly answers. This game is the ultimate in open endedness\replayability. I seriously urge you to stick with it if you get frustrated at first play. The rewards for learning this game are tremendous and will keep you coming back for years to come. I have spent months and months on end playing this game and I haven't even scratched an ""end game"".			"

The learning curve is massive, took me about 15hours till I started to get the hang of the controls and knew what to do. But as soon as you get to the point that you are building an empire, trading, mining and ultimately, fly your own fokin capital ships, it will blow your mind.Cons:AI pathfinding is dumb, making carriers very inefficiente since fighters will just crash into things, you are better off making a beast destroyer.Very steep learning curve.UI is also a pain in the butt to work with.That said,Hang in there, give it a shot, it's worth it.

												Great sandbox game. Actually, the greatest pure-sandbox game there is!It's a sandbox by its definition. You can do literally everything in this game, you can trade, fight, explore, build. I've sent hundreds of hours with this game and I've not done even half of what can be done. Last time I played it I had a giant Argon destroyer worth of 69 mln Cr, with weaponry worth of another 30 mln. And it wasn't just 'I have the money, so I can buy weapons', I had to find proper factories which produced weaponry of my desire, wait for them to build it, then buy it. I could make it easier, for example BUILD a factory, place it in space with my previously bought giant freight ship (40 mln or so), and then supply it and have the weapons for free (I would have to wait for it tho). I remember having also multiple fighter ships, all controlled by the computer. Each cost me around 2 mln Cr, with all its repairing (I found them or bought them in retail from other pilots scattered through sectors) and improved them, armed them. Now, imagine getting, like, 40 of those fighters into a big shuttle?Roaming around space in your tiny, but fast and manouvreable ship, looking for some missions to take? Suddelny you are being attacked by bunch of space pirates. You don't stand a chance. What do you do? Open the console, press few buttons and 30 second later those pirates are outnumbered 6 to 40 hi-tech military fighters + 2 heavy corvettes + giant ship with 40 cannons. Of course this much fire power was earned by hard work and a lot of time spent with this game. I remember, in the beginning I purchased a mining laser for my ship and went to asteroid field and destroyed giant rocks looking for iron, which i could later sell. Free currency? Maybe, but a lot of work put to it too. This game is a lot of fun and I recommend it to anyone, who loves sandbox games and has ♥♥♥♥♥on time on their hands.			"

But as soon as you get to the point that you are building an empire, trading, mining and ultimately, fly your own fokin capital ships, it will blow your mind.Cons:AI pathfinding is dumb, making carriers very inefficiente since fighters will just crash into things, you are better off making a beast destroyer.Very steep learning curve.UI is also a pain in the butt to work with.That said,Hang in there, give it a shot, it's worth it.

												Slow start and some getting used to, but never ceises to amaze with it's depth, stunning views, funny moments and huge replay value. If that wasn't enough, try Dead-is-Dead for a challenge you haven't seen before!			"

												Everytime I think i'm finished this game pulls me back.  It has a pretty steep learning curve and some mods are near essential but this game is the best space sand box i've played.  Good luck on that Hub plot though.			"

												This is a great space theme of the game, perform a task or trade, you can get the money to set up their own fleet and has the space station, create their own space empire. "

												This is THE game that I compare all other open world sandbox games to and they all fall short (including Egosoft's very own sequel which is actually one of the worst games of the series).This is the only game you need.The learning curve is steep and the UI/controls leave a lot to be desired - too many deep menus, but in the end it's completely worth it as to this day there is no other game that can compare in terms of freedom.The Albion Prelude DLC adds to the story and is also quite good as is Litcube's Mod (makes the game MUCH more user-friendly and makes the menus much more responsive - it's basically required).[Ignore my played time as I mostly played the CD version of this - with the new steam review system that unfortunately means my review doesn't count]			"
