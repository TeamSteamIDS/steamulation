												This game feels more like a proof of concept rather than an actual game. The look and feel is very unpolished.			"

												The goal of the game is to surpass and mantle the Creator of the universe. It's cheap and it isn't a bad game.			"

												Well, I got it for just 1€ through the sale, but still it's disappointing. The game feels very uneven, like made by an amateur. The tutorial is too long and too intrusive, you never really get to play and test what it tells you. The tutorial doesn't switch off automatically, you have to go to the settings. Even on the easy level you get very quickly killed, and after that the game is just over -- no savegame, no checkpoint, nothing. Each time you start from the very beginning, not even your player name is remembered. And after dying, the default option is not -- as one would expect -- to start a new game, no: the default is to visit the game's website. The end effect is that one has to make a lot of effort just in order to actually get into the game -- let alone enjoy it. This needs a lot of polish, even for a low price of 4€.			"

												Nope...this is just not good...probably cool to be played if drunk or other...but if sober, it's just terrible...Meaningless, with no goals, just a bounch of colors and sounds...			"

												This game is actually really awesome. Controls are simple enough (mouse to look, WASD to fly relative to where you're pointing), and the learning curve is nice and forgiving.Until you look outside the box(es). Then♥♥♥♥♥♥gets real. Seriously, solid recommendation. It's a cheap game. Enjoy.			"

												This is possibly one of the most enjoyable games of skill and tests of creative and critical problem solving I've seen. It's a fun game, and it's a lot deeper than it looks. It's more than it looks, like a 2D shooter in 3D, it's also a very deep sandbox building and expansion game.Definitely worth the small price.			"

												Well I'll make it quick. I got this game very long time ago to get archivement for something, dont exactly remember, anyways I do understand it's an indie game and I shouldn't expect much from this title but honestly it's just crap. Don't buy this, it's pointless. For this 1€ you can get better things, trust me.Pros;worksCons;everything what left			"

												This game has some potential and the mechanic is complex.It has low frame cap (30fps) and way too many skills that probably require many hours to figure out.Game is definitely playable but I felt there weren't enough excitement to continue playing.			"
