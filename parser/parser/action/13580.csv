												BAD Pc Port of a Decent Game...Double Agent is probably my least favorite Splinter Cell game so far (comparing it to 1, Pandora Tomorrow, and Chaos Theory). Still, it is a good game if you can find a way to avoid all the game crashes and glitches. It's too bad the pc port is so terrible. This is the first Splinter Cell pc game that I've had problems with. I made it halfway through the game with about 10 game crashes. Also, sometimes i run into a glitch where an invisible wall randomly appears in front of me to block my path. The safe-unlocking minigame is bugged as well. It took me a while to figure out that you have to have your movespeed set to 2 mouse-wheel ticks higher than the lowest in order to open a safe. Otherwise, the sensitivity is REAL high. If I look past the port problems, there is a good game here. The missions provide decent environment variety. They added in a double-agent objective mechanic where you can choose what objectives to complete. Your decisions affect your trust with the Agency and the Terrorists. This is probably the most stealth-heavy title in the series so far, but it doesn't feel satisfying. Chaos Theory felt a lot better. The visuals also look worse than Chaos Theory for some reason.Unfortunately, I don't think I will finish this game. I decided to quit halfway through because of all the game crashes and the inability to disable intro videos.			"

												The game itself is great, I recomend playing it if you haven't already, as it is the best game in the series IMO.Then why don't I recomend this?  Well,  IT'S A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE PORT!   It lacks any substantial graphics options even after patching the game through ubi's website, it has inconsistant controler support (I couldn't get either of mine to work but read on forums that people got their's working), keys aren't rebindable, but most importantly,  THE LIGHTING IS BROKEN!  A workaround/fix exists (see below), but that still doesn't change the fact that a stealth game that usualy relies on  light-dark stealth shipped with broken lighting.UPDATE:  I have been informed that you can use an official xbox controller on the game, but not any third party ones (which are both the ones i have).Here's the fix: http://withinwindows.com/blog/2011/07/31/make-splinter-cell-double-agent-playable-on-pc "

												PC version of this game is broken as F$%#. I never could get it working. I even have an old XP gaming rig just for older games like this and it still would not run on that one. its a shame because I thought this game was pretty alright when I played it on my 360 a few years ago. Just glad I got this on sale, but sad it was before valve offered refunds.Edit: well I finally got this game ""working"" for the most part. if you have 2 monitors hooked up unplug/disabled the second one if you are getting crashes on start up. even though I was able to play all the missions (except the prologue mission because my game would just crash to desktop after the credits rolled.) this game was still buggy as hell. lighting was broken/missing, it was odd I want to say it was missing shadows in a lot of areas or areas were really bright and washed out yet I was in the ""hidden state"" as the AI patrols passed me even though it was bright as day and I was completely viable. I want to say this was a bug but with Ubi PC ports you never know. other issues I had were lots of random crashes at load screens and whenever I dropped a body I was trying to hide i would take damage from it and any knocked out AI next to where I would drop the body would die from taking damage from the one I just dropped. overall I would still say pass on this game because of how janky and broken this port is on PC.

												I've had my fair share of bad ports on PC, however this one is... well, I can't even describe how bad it is. Let's start at the beginning. While the previous game of the franchise - Chaos Theory (yes, yes, one of the BEST stealth game of all time, however I won't go into further detail now) - got an update (1.05) to run in widescreen resolution (up to 1920*1200), this game did not, so you have to do some .ini tweaking to get the desired one. Since we're at tweaking, there are couple of options in the .ini which aren't even present in game (for tweaking and issue resolving I recommend this page: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Splinter_Cell:_Double_Agent ). Even after you've done everything in your power to make the game a bit better, the shadows frequently flicker or just outright don't appear.Then comes the sound: sometimes after loading the game, the game won't display a huge number of sounds (but you can still hear Sam's breathing, steps and muffled/glitched gun shots).Then comes the loading issue: the save system is abysmal, you have 3 spaces to choose which one you'd like to load from / save to, you can't rename your save files (maybe you can, but I got so frustrated with the menu that I'd rather used the quicksave/load option) and sometimes quicksaves just outright disappeared. This usually happened when the game crashed, I reloaded my game using the ""Continue"" option which did load the quicksave file, however after wanting the quickload said file, I couldn't. What?!I've written about the menu and how bad it is, but why you ask? Sometimes you can't navigate it with the keyboard (moreover it defaults to WASD rather then the arrow keys, but whatever), the mouse is janky and you can't use your mousewheel while browsing your save game files.The OPSAT (Sam's ~infobar on his wrist during the game) is also equally bad, has all the problems just mentioned.""Okay okay, but how's the game play?"" You might ask. Well I could have gotten over all of the above, if only it was good or at least not as bad as I've come to know it. One word: awful. The controls are sometimes unresponsive, Sam just doesn't want to grab that ledge or crawl into a ventilation system no matter hard you try (like he's also fed up with the whole game ""Nope, not gonna do it""). More often than not you get stuck on some random object which can also lead you being discovered or just missing your chance.I might have missed some issues because there's plenty and I didn't write any of it down, all of this is just off the top of my head. A real shame though because it was a great idea executed so poorly...So the question is: would I *recommend* the game? NO. If you like Splinter Cell, just skip it, if you're a ""hardcore"" SC fan, then you might, only might, want to give it a shot.			"

												[4/10]    As much as I'd love to finish this game, I don't think it will even let me. The game crashes almost every mission for no reason, quick saves will randomly decide to not load, the entire game just freezes during certain loading screens. Also, the game looks awful compared to previous games in the Splinter Cell franchise, which is odd, considering Chaos Theory was absolutely gorgeous for its time, and still holds up to this day. Sometimes shadows won't even render when the level loads, making the whole stealth mechanic extremely awkward. Being a huge fan of Splinter Cell, it's really unfortunate that this game is unstable, to the point of freezing my computer. I could only recommend this game to hardcore fans of the Splinter Cell franchise. I will attempt to finish this game, and if it gets better, I will edit this review. Until then, this still stands.[EDIT]So I've finished the game. The bugs and glitches are still present, no suprise there, but there was one specific bug that stood out amongst others: a game breaking bug. After completing the final mission, a cutscene is supposed to play, the credits should roll, and you are rewarded with a bonus mission. For me, and many others, this didn't happen. The mission would end, and then cut immediately to an overhead scene of the level where you are unable to move and unable to quit properly. (you have to enter the Task Manager and end it manually.) Aside from the awful technical issues, the gameplay and story are some of the best in the Splinter Cell series so far. It takes place shortly after the events of Chaos Theory, in which Sam must pose as a criminal and join a terrorist force in order to destroy them from the inside. The game has a ""trust meter,"" in which you have to complete objectives for the JBA: the terrorist force, and the NSA: the good guys. Due to trust being a factor, the game forces you to enter in these moral gray areas just to keep the trust of the enemy. While in the base, you have the option to research and spy on your allies/enemies to learn more info about them. This information will assist you in traversing the base as well as unlock special items for your missions. As with all previous games in the franchise, it is all based on stealth and using gadgets as well as the enviornment to your advantage to accomplish your objectives. If you've played a SC game in the past, you know what you're getting yourself into from a gameplay perspective. Summary: Splinter Cell: Double Agent is a fantastic game form a gameplay and story perspecrive, but it is hindered by so many techinical issues that it is not worth the purchase, at least not on the PC. I have heard that the concole version is much better, so if you would like to play this game, play it on the Xbox, PS2, or PS3.			"

												The game looks good, but so many crashes ! I played 1.5 hours I had the game crashing during loading missions, twice. First time between 2nd and 3rd mission. OK, relaunch the game, surprise ! Auto-saves aren't ""true"" saves, so restart the game from the beginning. And guess what ? Crash between 1st and 2nd mission :-/ Uninstalled...EDIT: I found a crash fix : disabling Steam overlay may fix that.			"

												You know that feeling? When you get a game you saw in a LP and which seemed good, a game even your friends and relatives told you was good, and when you finally get your hands on it, you realise it's absolutely terrible?Well that's my Double Agent experience for you.Let's start from the top. The game has an unskippable super long intro, one you must endure every time you boot the game, but also every time you come back to the main menu for some reason. Loading times are attrociously long for a game that old, especially seeing how good and new my computer is.Controls are bad, especially the ""new"" water controls. You also no longer can grab an opponent on stairs, despite the fact you could do it in Chaos Theory, and that game was a lot older. Somehow the elevation slight difference mess up with the prompt.The game is crash heavy. First I had a bug where the game automatically loaded my last save without giving me the main menu, which always crashed said game until it stopped to do that for some weird reason. Then the game crashes every single mission change. In multiple parts missions, it crashes at zone change.The HUD that was so convenient in Chaos Theory is completly gone. The new system is too simplistic and vague and seldom helps.The PC version smells like a terrible port. It's choke full of bugs. If your remap your keys then try to rename your profile, instead of using your normal keyboard, it will change every key you remapped to its new equivalent. For exemple if you put couch on ctrl, you will need to press ctrl to write a C, because the original key for crouch was C... The safe cracking game is horrible because it was obviously designed with a controller in mind. Not only that, but there is a crippling bug which prevents you from moving the gears if you don't raise your speed to max. On some missions, bodies will get detected even if they are hidden and there is no one to detect them. On others, you will get your stats messed up, like one mission dependant kill which will somehow count as two kills... Ennemies see you with their butts. The particuliarly huge offenders being snipers, who are similar to the ones in the very first splinter cell in terms of complete bull. It's especially obvious on some missions where you can watch a video of someone playing on hard and doing something on console, and not get seen, while you do the same thing on easy on PC and will get noticed(Shangai mission, the guard opening the vent when you're hanging from the ledge).Controls are klunky and overall unresponsive. Jumping is particularly awkward, but any kind of ""platforming"" is terrible. You can't rename your saves, so identifying which one is which is a nightmare. Besides the system is so bad if you select a save with your mouse to overwrite, you may overwrite an other save. Only the one in the middle of the list is the one affected, even if you selected the top or bottom one. And yes, this can cause you to delete a very important save. You can no longer use the mouse to press the key on a keypad to enter the code...The list goes on. It's like a HUGE step backward from Chaos Theory. It's just so bad I can't focus on the story... I just can't because every enjoyment I could have is ruined by thoses crippling problems. And like I said, they all seem to share the same origin: Being a terrible console port. It's just a wonderful exemple of ""When Ubisoft started to really decline"". This game is pure pain, and I recommend to anyone to stay clear from it.			"

												Summed Up: A really awful port to an otherwise pretty fun game. Buy this game on any other platform and you'll have a fun time, but avoid the PC version like the devil.In-Depth: I'll start with the game itself. It's not going to be anyones favourite Splinter Cell as, quite frankly, it's one of the more linear and demanding of the series. Gone is the option to play the game your way and still get the best score if you complete the objectives; now the game ranks you on stealth. It provides penalties to how many guards you knock out/kill, locks you break etc. Meaning you have to basically be a shadow to get the best score. This is a fair idea, but the problem is, the level often throws enemies at you you HAVE to move out the way, or you have to do something ridiculously convoluted to get them to move; which just takes up way too much time.Also introduced is the trust system; a fine line you have to take between both the terrorists and your employers. Alot of people were kind of iffy on this, but I honestly liked the idea. The main issue stems from the fact it's completely pointless. There are enough side objectives and such that you'll honestly always have full trusts 99.9% of the time; even on hard mode where you lose trust more and gain less. If they had made it much more imperitive to the game and maybe had it so you gained rewards from having certain levels, or even something as simple as dialogue change, it might have been  a worthy addition. As it stands, it's just kind of there; a nice idea that dosen't realise it's full potential. As for the core game, it's pretty much Chaos Theoy's mechanics again. This is fine as, in my opion, Chaos Theory really got it right when it came to the stealth aspect and design; n both games have a nice, easy to navigate ingame inventory, the layouts easy to see etc. One major gripe thought is that they changed the stealth meters; as in, they no longer exist. In Chaos Theory, they had two bars which showed your visibility and sound. This was useful as it indicated how alert enemies where sound wise and indicated clearly how sneaky you were being. In this game, you have a light, that's it. It's green when your safe, yellow when not, and red when spotted. The problem is, while it takes into account shadows and does change when enemies are more alert, it never shows how much noise your making; which can be a HUGE problem if your next to an alerted enemy and want to sneak past him QUIETLY. But, that aside, it is for all intents and purposes just more of Chaos Theory sanded down. Back handed as that is, I'm not complaining at  a few more levels.Now for the crux of the problem; the PC Port. The best summary would be 'A glitched up mess that everytime I play I find another'. The most common one is random crashes and lost autosaves, but there are weirder ones. Lost sound, not gaining your bonus equipment, a door not supposed to be there stuck in another door (Yes, that actually happened), do I need to go on? Not to mention graphically, the game just looks off. There is a guide to tweak this on steam, but the fact you HAVE to do this is pretty appaling; without the tweaks, the game looks... well, off, it's hard to explain, kinda like the world is slowly falling away pixel by pixel in the background. There are alot of things in this port that just make it dissapointing, and I really tried to look past them. But the bugs really were the final straw. Avoid the port like the devil, patches have been known to exist, but wether they work is apparently 50/50. Go buy another version of the game elsewhere; you'll be glad you did			"

												I've played through Double Agent on DVD shortly after it was released on PC. Somewhere near the end of the game (in one of the Kinsasha-missons), I got stuck. Everytime I tried to load a safe, I would spawn under the map, resulting in Game Over. When I recently discovered Double Agent on Steam, I picked it up. I was hoping that they fixed at least some of the bugs and I would finally be able to play through the story. Unfortunately, I was wrong.The engine is very buggy. Sometimes there's no sound, sometimes you get stuck. Many times, the game will crash when saving or loading. Saves are very unreliable: they either disappear or just don't work.The stealth isn't great. The levels are rarely dark. The sound- and lightmeter of the previous game(s) are replaced by a big light on Sam's back. That light indicates if you're hidden, not hidden, or spotted. It doesn't always work: often you're supposedly hidden, but a guy at the other side of the map can still spot you. Sometimes you're not hidden, but there's a huge snowstorm going on and a guy on the other side of the level still raises the alarm. Especially on ""Hard""-difficulty, not getting spotted is VERY strict.The interface is ported almost straight from the console-version. The inventory and interactions are kinda slow to use, as you have to cycle through them. There is no way to bind different weapons or gadgets to keys on your keyboard. You can't just plug in a controller to play this game. One positive note: you can use the Steam Controller set to KB/M-bindings. That works pretty well. The options in the menu are very limited. You can select ""Normal"" or ""Next-Gen"" graphics, and resolutions up to 1600x1200 pixels. Not all keybindings can be changed. The list of saves is very short, so you have to scroll a lot (and as mentioned before, the saves often don't work).There are some good things about this game, too. The story is arguably the best part of this game. The undercover-aspect is a fresh approach which works well enough. There are some very interesting locations, and they often look well (for their age). And finally, it is more Splinter Cell.If you are a die-hard Splinter Cell-fan, you might be interested to pick this up. But be warned that the experience might be troubled by technical difficulties or can be plain frustrating. If you're new to series or only a casual fan, check out the other games like Chaos Theory of Blacklist.=====TL;DR=====+ Story+ Locations+ Undercover+ Splinter Cell- Interface for controllers- No support for controllers- Unreliable saving / loading- Very limited menus- Many crashes- Many bugs- Average stealth:* It's barely dark* Enemies are super sensitiveConclusion: Double Agent is a very bad port which suffers from many bugs and is often frustrating. Only get if you're a very big Splinter Cell-fan.			"

												Only buy this game if you're ready to spend a lot of time going around bugs and crashes! Playing on genuine Windows 7 64.* On JBA HQ level, one of the door is impossible to open (no action panel), which makes it impossible to get one of the secondary objectives without ""cheating"" using noclip mode.* On most of the Shangai level, the game crashes when you try to save!!* In game, I can only use the quick load function. Trying to load a specific save doesn't work. Workaround: Kill yourself and then the load menu works.* ALT-Tabbing out of the game makes it crash more often than not.* Sometimes the game crashes randomly (thankfully quite rare).* Loads of graphical glitches. Anti-aliasing doesn't seem to work.			"

												Nice otherwise (after ini-file edit to enable better graphics), but loading the save games didn't work for me at all. And this game crashes alot, so frustation level can be high especially when the save games won't work and you have to start beginning of the mission sometimes.I also heard that the best version was only for PS2/Gamecube/Xbox. So if you happen to own one of those systems, might be better option to pick that up instead of this.Oh, and if you run into a bug before the credits roll, change the game resolution to lower like 1024x768 and the ending will trigger.

												A buggy mess that barely runs on PCs. Experience the thrill of editing .ini files and having the game crash on you 75% of the time when loading between levels. I was somehow able to get the game to crash when switching between weapon attachments on the tanker level. And at the very end of the storymode if you've edited the game to support 1920x1080, because it doesn't natively, it will freeze. The only way to get around this is by setting the game to a resolution that it actually supports. How the hell does it not support 1080p. What a piece of trash.Chaos Theory really was the pinnacle in terms of stealth for this series. Instead of keeping the perfect light and sound meters, they decided to just completely remove the sound meter, and attach a traffic light onto Sam's back, to let you know if you're hidden or not. There are plenty of instances in this game where you should be 100% hidden, but because of the terrible lighting system they opted to use for this game, you're not. There is no absolute darkness in this game and for that reason I never found myself having to use the trademark goggles. The Stealth in Double Agent is a joke.Lastly, you can look forward to suffering through a nonsensical barebones story that will leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth after it's over. In some alternate reality Ubisoft didn't hire a b-team to crap out this game and instead allowed the Chaos Theory team to port over their version of Double Agent once the 6th gen one was out. This version (the 7th gen) of Double Agent is where Splinter Cell died. Rest in peace.			"

												I bought this in a steam sale with the other Splinter Cell games. After really enjoying Chaos Theory, I had very high hopes for Double Agent.  The first sign of trouble was the game did not support 1080p.  Chaos Theory from two years prior did, but Double Agent did not.  Instead, I was stuck with 720p.  Double Agent suffers from bugs and graphical issues throughout the game.  The lighting engine went from being very powerful and realistic to downright terrible.  The designers also removed fun features such as the sound meter and degrees of light.Everything has been dumbed down in this game.  To make the UI more minimal, the light meter is now green for hidden, yellow for visible, and red for spotted.  Half the time you'll be standing in total darkness and have it still be yellow.The PC port of Double Agent also crashes horribly.  Expect it to freeze up when loading requiring you to restart your computer.  Like previous Splinter Cell games, it lets you save wherever you are in the level.  Unlike previous Splinter Cell games though, there is no way of sorting your saved games.  So expect to have to dig through all your saves when you are trying to find the one you are looking for; there is no way to sort them.Lastly, the gameplay is horrendous.  Half the missions take place during the day and are better played like a first person shooter than a stealth game.  Just shoot everything, don't bother with stealth.  I had high hopes for Double Agent and was sorely disappointed.  Don't buy this game!  Just read the synopsis and move on.			"

												Anyone who respects the plot and cinematic appeal behind original Sam Fisher will appreciate this installment for its genuine one-of-a-kind qualities. When I was younger, I was astounded at seeing Sam like never before and divulging in his world as a double agent; replaying this game allowed me to fully appreciate the detail that was put into the old Splinter Cell series. This isn’t the new Fisher with a kid’s voice and superman agility; this is Sam at his finest in a world that, in this gamer’s opinion, flawlessly assimilates secret agent movie and video game into one body. While the Steam version of this title isn’t without its programming flaws, I still respect Double Agent as the greatest Splinter Cell and honestly believe it was the first and only of its kind. If anyone is on the fence about playing this game, please give it a chance and, if you do, take the time to EXPLORE EVERYTHING! It’s challenging, but each level is timed just right to do everything you need and more.   "

												After finishing SC: Chaos Theory, I wanted to go for a newer game in the series. I thought it would be so FUN. But... it's such a frustrating game from the very first seconds after you launch it.-You have to manually edit .ini files to get a desirable resolution and fov.-The graphics looks like sh*t compared to Chaos Theory (even tho the animations look more refined). -The night vision and termal vision are so badly done. Visually It's such a downgrade from the previous games.-In-game controls are so dumb, especially the rotating action menus (when you want to pick up a body, use the computer, switch the lights and so on).And then the game crashed. I think I'm done with this one already.			"

												Besides being a terrible PC port with crashes, glitches, long loading times, bad performance and requiring you to actually manually download a patch, this game feels very incomplete (it's the 360 version after all) leaving many plot and character development holes, a morality system that barely does anything, and a terrible ending which is just audio over the credits. It's a very unsatisfying game. If you really want to play Double Agent, get the PS2/Xbox/Gamecube version, which was made by the Chaos Theory devs and it actually feels complete. Also you never get dubs in this game. Not recommended.			"

												Horrible port from console to PC don't get it. Another one of Ubisofts crap buggy ports which you can buy from steam without knowing that it has tons of issues crammed into it.Personal experiences:- UI menu's and mouse controls horrid especially on the 3d map.- Levels of speech between NPC's sound unbalanced on rare occassions.- Game crashes when trying to save the game 'RunTime' error during Shanghai level including saving on automatic checkpoint.- AI bug out and become unresponsive and paths become broken quite often.- Checkpoints to load the next part of the game sometimes do not execute. Including the completion of the final mission.- Intro audio to West Africa mission does not have audio, nor was there any sound effects, ambience enemies voices etc.- Sometimes game will crash between loading screens on missions.- Sometimes game will crash when trying to load a save game.- No support for HD resolution or AA without 3rd party mod - very dated.- Can't load save games from menu sometimes either, just refreshes the load menu.-  No ability to delete save games from the menu.Despite these issues I had fun with the game itself, it ran smooth, the ingame keyboard and mouse controls are responsive but can be a little twitchy at times. If you are really wanting to play the series and don't want to skip this one I reccomend that you download an 100% completion save game so that if there is any major issues preventing you from playing a part of a mission you could just watch the remainder of the mission on youtube then load the next chapter.

												Features-Third Person -Stealth-Story Rich-Long Missions-Some Missions Are Complicated Such as Puzzles -Some Mission you have to find ways to get to the next area to advance-Unlockables-Slight (Very Slight) Replayability-Online CO-OP Mode With Seperate CO-OP Story. (Online Servers are Shutdown)You choose the Pro's and Con's here becuase some people may argue about which is a pro and con and which is'nt.Summery Review: Splinter Cell Double Agent is a Third Person Action Stealth Shooter Released in 2006 as part of the Splinter Cell Series by Ubisoft and Tom Clancy. Splinter Cell Double Agent has alot of improvements from the previous title Splinter Cell Chaos Theory. The first really big Noticable Change from the previous title Chaos Theory is the graphic's. Splinter Cell Double Agents Graphics when it first released were updated from Chaos Theory but games grow old and with age comes with updates. Several of said updates added significant improvements to graphic's and added more options than before. Some other changes include new animations being added, more stability for modern system as well as compability for out-of-date systems (If your computer really is that old). Next thing players are gonna notice right off the bat when first playing Double agent is the length and difficulty of the missions. Double Agent Contains many things that no other splinter cell has one of them being the extreme length of the mission. These missions can be very comparable to the missions we seen in the original splinter cell and may take 40+ minutes to finish. The AI has gotten Tougher in this title and I found it hard to complete missions and playing on the hardest difficulty seemed nearly impossilbe due to the AI's ability to seemlessly shoot you through the wall but that is made but for by it's ""Call of duty Style"" 1-3 Shots results in the player dying. The game will get you through about 11 hours of total gameplay before beating the story I have owned this game for years and always find myself going back and restarting the game just to find that one area I never discovered or could never get into because it always seemed near impossible to get into without getting killed or detected. Replayability is also fun to find those computers that you may have missed or forgotten about with some splinter cell lore contained. One thing Splinter Cell Double Agent Introduced to the splinter cell Series in Unlockables. Unlockables in splinter cell double agent is obtained by completing ""Star Objectives"" which are usually optional objective but completeing them unlocks equipment that give the player an advantage in there undercover black operations within john brown's Army"" Splinter Cell double Agent did include a CO-OP Mode with a Seperate story portrayed by the two characters from the previous splinter cell co-op Story mode but the servers were shutdown and the mode is no longer available. There is a feature in this game exclusive to double agent allowing the player to make story effecting decision's. Such Decisions will effect the Trust Meter between the NSA and the JBA. If the player allows one of these meters to expire the mission fails immediately until the player increases the expired meter. During the Beginning of the Story another Double Agent Exclusive Feature is found in the game which is Snowy enviroments. During the Beginning of the game Sam is given his ""First Real Test"" mission by the JBA and is taked with hijacking a supertanker Somewhere within Northern Russia and the Entire Mission is a Snow Enviroment where the player has to navigate through a blizzard and a white out which can be very difficult even when using the Goggles. Continuing on with the double agent exclusive feature, Underwater enviroments and combat. In Splinter Cell Double Agent we find a feature that is not in any other splinter cell that allows the player to swim around in water and submerge under. During the Mission to Hijack the Supertanker and the Very First mission in Island the player has the ability to surface but will be blocked by frozen water and has to cut through it to reach the surface. If there is an enemy on the ice above the player, the player has the ability to grab through the ice and pull there victim under and stab them to death. If the Victim is on an ajacent Shore by the frozen water or unfrozen even, the player also has the ability to take care of them this by pulling them off the shore and under the water.Conclusion: Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell is a pretty dated game from the Early 2000's but The game introduced alot of feature we see in Splinter Cell Conviction and Blacklist. Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Contains many things only seen in Double Agent that I would like to see in future splinter cell titles. The Game has excellent graphics for its age. The difficulty for this game is a bit much when going into the hardest difficulty settings due to the AI being able to shoot through the walls at the player. I recommend this game I think its an excellent title and I think it brought us some great features that we see in modern titles and future titles. Some Exclusive Features such as the ability to use water as cover and a means of killing your enemy id like to see in future titles. I had alot of fun beating it years ago and still do today.			"

												Splinter cell double agent is my favourite game in the series. Its the most fun ive had in a splinter cell game and the most memorable (ive played and beat them all). It tries something new and succeeds at doing so. It has the best story in the series and the only good story imo and the whole trust system is fantastic.The JBA base missions are so intense. This game get too much hate and i feel its a very underrated gem. I just wished the game didn't crash on me so many times this pc version is unstable and the graphics in this version isn't very good, play it on console if you can. Even though i had more fun playing this game then chaos theory i can't say that its better. Chaos theory is the best splinter cell game i just like double agent more because it has its own charm to it that appeals to me more. I gave chaos theory an 8 and i cant score this game higher because it isn't a better game. 8/10 (Great)			"

												I have been a fan of the Splinter Cell series ever since it was released, and I have played and owned all of the games (except for Conviction - I draw the line with what they did with their DRM). Personally, my favorite game is Splinter Cell Double Agent. Granted it took me a very long time to get it up and running on my computer, (it certainly is buggy - be prepared for that) I still feel that the story line and the unique gameplay experience was the most enjoyable that I had throughout the series.I just wanted to put my two cents in there for those of you who might be considering buying but have been put off from all of the comments across the web. Make no mistake, the game is certainly buggy, but if you look carefully you can find guides to help you get it running. For around $3.50 I would certainly say you should pick it up. If you do, you're in for a pleasant surprise.			"

												Warning! The port is quite bad. Very long loading screens, poor graphic options, some graphical issues (in the tutorial area the bloom was so high I couldn't distinguish walls from floor - the whole thing takes place in a assassin's-creed-like digital while room,) and the game would freeze by the end and refuse to play the final cutscene until I changed my resolution. The controls worked just fine with keyboard and mouse in previous installments but they don't work well in this one. Movement feels clunky and some minigames (like safecracking minigame) have some serious issues.The game itself is a mixed bag. I wish Steam would have a ""maybe"" option for recommendations. There were quite a few frustrations. Instant failures are common and it is not always clear where can you go and were you can't. The levels are still pretty linear with a few exceptions. The theme though. While it is still a Splinter cell game and you will sneak a lot this time you are a double-agent breaking the terrorist cells from inside. The biggest addition is the trust meter of both Terrorists and Echelon. You need to keep both factions satisfied otherwise you loose. It makes the missions more tense as you get multiple objective from both factions (often conflicting with each other) and you have to choose on fly which ones you can afford to skip. This system also rewards skilled players. For instance killing innocents will couse the Echelon to be displeased with you, therefore players ability to stay hidden and avoid contact with the enemy is rewarded. My favourite part of the game ere the semi-sandbox levels which take place in terrorist hideout. In these the player is given a main and sideobjectives from both terrorists and echelon and has around 30 minutes to complete as many of them as possible. It is a great idea which works really well and uses Sam's stealth ability in a very organic way.So yeah, I think it is an interesting game and it is a worth a shot when caught on sale. It does have a lot of issues though.			"

												A game that amuses itslef with crashing every 10 minutes. It's stealth mechanics are so broken that I don't even know where to start.For instance, you're on a map in some antarctic setting, it's a snowstorm. Everything is white, you got a sight range of aproximatly 15 meters and you are wearing white camo clothings. And the enemies still spots you at 50 + meters away, using eyes only.But then again, what did i expect from a stealth game that doesn't even show you the shadows of object? (because clearly the snowstorm problem above could have been solved if i actually clung to the shadows of that tent...)I've honestly spent more time in the loadingscreens than playing the actual game.Don't play it even if you get payed to do it.

												This is probably the only review that I'm writing that I wished had a neutral button. This game has some positive moments and negative moments. Here is the positive things about this game:+ Trust System+ Weapons+ Gadgets/ Gadget Upgrades+ The Shanghai mission+ The CharactersNow here's the negative things about this game:- Crashes a lot- Buggy small areas of an environment- Buggy Gadget Unlockables-  Killing Lambert is the canon choice whether you wanted to do it or not. (I mean I didn't want to shoot him and I wanted to save him but Splinter Cell: Conviction assumed Sam Fisher shot Irving Lambert which in a way screws up the storyline.) All in all, this game looks great graphically but story-wise it kind of fails and flops on its own. Like I said before, I wish there was a neutral button for reviews on games that were meh instead of good or bad. "

												I'm a big fan of the splinter cell series, but this game is actually trash.  I bought it not knowing that the original Xbox version is actually an entirely different game, that is not trash, and can actually run without crashing, unlike this version.  The controls are kinda weird to start, and the lighting system in it doesnt seem to work at all.  Enemies can see through walls in some missions, making 100% stealth quite frustrating.  Sometimes doors (that are entirely necessary to go through to complete the mission) don't work at all, and I had to either restart the mission (if that worked) or wait until an enemy somehow manages to open it.  Other than all the bugs, the storyline isn't actually at all good, so I have no idea how they went from chaos theory to this.  To top it all off, at the end of the game, the game crashes before the last cutscene can play so you don't actually get to know what happens.  Waste of time, wish steam would refund the hours of my life I put into this game.			"

												It's a nice game, with good game story. You definitely should play Double Agent, if you played other Splinter Cell games. But it's a collection of bugs. First of all, i had to manually install Directx 9, and 1.02 patch, or the game crashed at start. Often at the loading screen it just crashes, so you have to save your game very often. Even if you save, when the game crashes, sometimes it corrupts the save, and the game files. When this happens, you should verify the game files in Steam. That helps. After the last mission, it freezes. You have to set the resolution to 4:3, to continue the game with the bonus map.			"

I  care less of the graphics, the gameplay looks good. But I am unable to proceed if this keeps up, please fix this and I'll change my reviews.

												You should only get this if you're a hardcore Splinter Cell fan and are willing to look past some major bugs and other flaws.First of all, you'll notice that Sam finally took some diazepam before each mission, so your aim is actually steady for once, and not more unstable than a retired old man hooked up to an iv of sherbert. So the aiming has definitely improved and you can actually take people out silently with one shot without first missing five times, then alerting everyone from here to Timbuktu.At least some of the levels are decent, and some are meh, then you have the reoccuring JBA levels where you are given a timer of about 25 minutes or so, and in that time you can complete objectives for either the NSA, or the JBA. Usually at least one of these objectives is more or less mandatory but if you sit on your ♥♥♥ too much and not complete anything, you will lose trust with whichever side you were sitting on your ♥♥♥ for.Oh yeah, this game has a trust system, where you can choose which side to stab in the back and then get a different ending and certain cutscenes are different :D! Some objectives in any given level can gain trust for one side and reduce trust for the other, and if you lose too much trust for either side, its game over.Well I guess I should mention those bugs now, well for me anyway; some of the safecracking minigames would just act like my keyboard was dead or something, and it wouldn't react to my input  whatsoever, so I had to skip them (Good thing those particular safes were optional) and lose a staggering amount of trust for the NSA, nearly causing me to get a game over. Also at the ending cutscene where some guys break through the ceiling windows, they just stand around, staring angrily into the next room where Sam was, doing nothing, and the soldiers would just randomly move around and glitch up and down stairs and whatnot (What a fitting, hilarious ending to this glitchy mess of a PC version of a game), so I couldn't actually see the credits and the ending, so I raged out of the game and just watched the ending online.It's kind of ridiculous how the other two earlier Splinter Cell games on steam work just fine but this, the more recent one, is a good bit broken and glitchy. Either way, they should have this ♥♥♥♥ patched, period. And not have us get a third party patch or go on their site or whatever, it's just plain annoying.It's not a terrible game but I just wish it wasn't a glitchfest of a PC port and the game did certain things better.This is definitely my least favorite Splinter Cell game, right next to Conviction.

												Some games do not age well. And Splinter Cell: Double agent is a great example of that. There is a lot of things wrong with the game and not many that were done right. I finished the game but there were times I thought about not trying to.Lets start with bad then shall we.The game crashes. And it crashes a lot. And there is no pattern just when will it crash. Sometimes in the middle of the mission, sometimes on mission load, sometimes on intro or outro of the mission. And sometimes it works just fine for an hour or longer. But on other times crashes after ten or fifteen minutes. Quite annoying. And once you decide to exit game, it can freeze itself forcing you to restart the windows in order to regain control.The graphics are aged and it shows. Fact that highest resolution is 1600x900 does not help either. To top that the first mission is really ugly which makes matters even worse at first. You get used to it later on and it's not that bad as the first impression.Audio seems fine most of times. Though lack of subtitles is extremely annoying. This was almost a reason not to play the game. The game does not introduce itself very well. It lacks that modern tutorial/guide style so present everywhere. This is somewhat refreshing but leaves a lot for player to figure out. Some things I've learned on almost ending missions. But the lack of waypoints saying exactly where to go was a bit of back to the roots trip. When you actually had to figure stuff out instead of going after the flashing blip. The story is rather bland. The start of it a disaster I would say. It gets a bit better later on but it is not to original or interesting at that. Mechanically it's not too good as well. The three vision mode, night, head and electronics are pretty much useless. I don't think I used them even once in a meaningful way. Shooting and combat are bad. Most annoying thing being - why the hell is a pistol more accurate than a rifle? I mean really. Grenades are useless as well.As a stealth game it fares much better. Sneaking is satisfying as much as stabbing the guys in the back. Most of the missions can be completed by remaining stealthy which is nice. Safe cracking is a nightmare though. The controls for it are terrible.That should be about time to tell something good about the game. So what it does going for it are pretty well designed levels and missions. They're interesting and challenging. Some of them are approachable by different ways I guess though it's not the same amount of freedom as Hitman games for example. Also the JMB headquarter levels are very nice - especially with the trust mechanic. This is the only part that makes the game worth playing. Time you are given to complete some additional objectives really adds to the double agent atmosphere.Overall I'd say 6/10 if you disregard the crashes. Not really something I can wholeheartedly recommend though I've played worse games.			"

												This game is pretty buggy. From the Kinshasa mission onwards I could not quick load without crashing the game so I just resorted to playing the rest of the game with the invincibility cheat activated. I'm sorry. Elsewise, the game was engaging and entertaining.I thought this was the second game in the series but it turns out it is the third so I'm playing them out of order...The gameplay has changed from the first. Most notably, to me anyway, the contextual action drop down menu in the top corner is gone. Now you have these large action icons that pop up in the middle of the screen when you want to interact with anything. I found this a little annoying and, admittedly, console gamey in a bad way.

												6 out of 10This is the 4th episode in the Splinter Cell series.  You play as Sam Fisher, an operative in 3rd Echelon a top secret NSA black-op outfit.  Its all about stealth, not so much on killing. If you haven't played any Splinter Cell game yet, what?  Where have you been.  These are great games.  However, you should not start with SC Double Agent. This game is for SC veterans who want to do it all.  I started on this game three times.  Only the last time did I bite the bullet and stuck through.  Unfortunately compared to the previous SC games this one is slightly disappointing.  The good: 1. Decent stealth based action.  Shooting is not what its about and the shooting system has never been a strong point in any SC game - it is very static. The bad: 2. Where is the luminosity meter?  Knowing when shadows are enough to cover you is a guessing game. 3. The choices you make have no discernable impact on the game.  Only the cut-scenes. 4. What is the story all about?  Some people want to blow up the USA, but why? 5. The characters are as thin as wet paper.  Sam's daughter is killed off at the start, why? 6. You unlock lots of equipment.  When do you actually get to use it? The ugly: 7. Horrible stability issues.  My game crashed about five times per mission. 8. Character model getting stuck in the scenery.

												The shadows in the PC version of the game are broken. At times you'll be standing in full light and apparently the game will think you are in complete darkness, and at other times you'll be standing in the darkest corner of the room and the game will treat it as if you're in broad daylight. Other problems include the question of how a ragtag domestic terrorist group has the funds and technology required to send you out on half the missions.The Shanghai mission was really good though.

												As a hardcore Splinter Cell fan growing up with the series I really can say this is the worst ♥♥♥♥ing game ive ever played. The worst port of all time gives you wonderful glitches every 15 minutes that makes you restart the game, not to mention the crap controls, horrific story (old gen version is sooo much better), and level design that instead like other splintercell games would take me about 45 minutes to 90 minutes per mission going through first time, i beat all mission in about 10 to 18 minutes going first time in this game. Even the last mission gave a crappy very easy (on the hardest difficulty) level. The only thing hard about this game is avoiding all glitches and figuring out, that to stop the glitch upon Fisher getting arrested in the last mission and the game freezing, is to turn the resolution to the smallest for the game move forward into the last cutscene. Also every you alt tab it either crashes or takes ♥♥♥♥ing 5 minutes just to load back in. Not recommended 2/10 would not play again.Hell this game was worst than Blacklist and its basic story, and Essientals combined.			"

												Splinter Cell is without fail or question my favorite game series by far. I have been a fan since the first SC game which I had on PS2. Sam Fisher is the most efficent and effective spec ops soldier ever created imo. I am definately more into third person gaming and the mix of stealth and action in these games is unmatched. You have so many tools of the trade to utilize. The Double Agent game offers so many choices for Sam, eah leading down a different road to who he is to become by end game. It is definately recommended by me. The story of Sam Fisher just keeps going and he never skips a beat. Great game, great franchise, great hero, another A+ without a doubt...			"

												Double Agent is an ok game, not good, not bad, just ok. The main reason for this is at when it was released for PC and Xbox 360, Ubisoft, for some reason, decided to change the gameplay and story from the PS2 and Xbox game. My advice is to get your hands on the xbox or PS2 version, since this game is a lot different from this one. You have the good old gameplay from Chaos Theory, and the story actually makes sense.

General GameplayTom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent is a third-person stealth game, where we infiltrate a criminal organization to destroy it from the inside. We have some major choices that change the ending making the story way more interesting than the previous titles.The controls are the same as previous titles.It's way harder to stealth your way through the missions, there's even some missions on daylight, something new in the series.The Manual Saves option where we can save anywhere, make the game less frustrating.Gameplay Rating: 4/5EngineUnreal Engine 2.5Graphics OptionsIt's extremelly disapointing that the game only supports 4:3 resolution, considering the previous title had widescreen support.At least we finally have V-Sync and Anti-Aliasing available, and Windowed mode is back.Graphics QualityGame looks awesome ignoring some ice/water problems, had a good boost in quality overall.They also fixed the animation problems that were present on the previous title.PerformanceGame runs fine, but it's hard to say how well it runs on inferior hardware.Engine Rating: 3/5Overall Rating: 7/10NotesOverall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and engine (how the game looks and runs).

												I really enjoy this game.  It has decent graphics, good controls, and a great gameplay experience.  The story is engrossing and the stealth is fun to play with.  This is a game I think many people would enjoy playing.  You can choose between Third Echelon, the main spy group, or a terrorist group of trained mercenaries.  Your choices decide what team to play for.  I am a very large fan of this game since its first release on the... XBox I believe.  I would give this game an 8 out of 10 if I were reviewing it.  It also has a great multiplayer that is so fun and advanced that I can't properly explain it in words.  You just have to take my word for it.  It's about $2.50 in USD if you are interested.  A weekend sale just started, so please go play and enjoy yourselves. :D			"

												Well, what can i say about this game? That it's actually very good but the port not so much. You will spend most of the time configuring the .ini files to get the better visuals, which when are on maximum settings are actually pretty, not ""Chaos Theory pretty"" though. Now about the gameplay, you can see the transition to Splinter Cell: Conviction already in this game, and by that i mean that in the old SC games there was a lot in hidding in the shadows, the levels were more dark and this one is not so much like that. But that does not mean that there is no stealth aproach, actually it's the better way to complete the missions as in the older ones by going silent and sneaky. The enemies are more alert in this one, they can see you better at long distances and now you don't have the lightmeter to help you out, and because of that you have to think more about the way you are going approach the enemies, and maybe use more the variety of gadgets and guns that you have on your disposal.I liked what they done with the story and the fact that you have to make decisions to progress, that particular aspect of the game surprised me a lot and some of those are game changing are hard to make. In overall i enjoyed this game, i don't say to pick it up at a full price but to wait for a sale but that's mainly because of the visuals issues and some other bugs.			"

												Otherwise I like Splinter Cell series, I played all the way to Double Agent, but the PC version is quite bad on the technical side. There are a lot of bugs that have bothered me (problems with shadows and lighting, problems with saving, problems with the gadgets, the occasional crashes...). On the other hand, the story is quite good, and there's everything else that makes Splinter Cell series good. When working properly the game is good and fun, and if you can overlook mentioned shortcomings, it is worth to play. My rating 6.5/10.			"

												I played this game very late compared to its release date, so the very poor graphics threw me out a bit.I always wanted to resume in the series though, and I was not disapointed. I bought a controller for my PC only to play this game. The gameplay is as expected, the environments are varied, the story is interesting. The parts in the base, even if somewhat repetitive, were exciting and playing through the most difficult part filled me with anxiety. Overall, the game was an interesting continuation for the series, even though it didn't have the charm of Chaos Theory (but I played it too late to enjoy the graphics, so there's that). I recommend it, but only if you want to play all the titles of the series. Otherwise, there's no need to: just catch up on the story with the game wiki and play the most recent entries.			"

												I've seen ""ports"" as they're called before and as much as my fellow PC gamers complain about them I usually don't mind. Sometimes I'm just grateful a game is available on PC. This time however I feel I must join the complainers since it's actually justified this time.The game itself is pretty great in my opinion, but it's ruined by many bugs/glitches like game saves frequently getting corrupted for no apparent reason, invisible obstacles, and sounds not playing like the audio files are messed up or something. On top of that; you can only select resolutions below 1080p. The resolution actually didn't bother me much, but it's just one more mark against the PC version and I know it will bother some gamers.

												Ubisoft Shanghai developed this game and they don't know how to make a Splinter Cell game.The interface is stupid. No way to tell whether Sam is hidden in the shadows or not. If you think he is covered by the lack of light, expect guards to say, ""Did I just see something?"" and investigate. Hiding in shadows is a feature that's almost non exsistant in this game.The context user interface sucks. It's slow to use because you don't scroll, you control it with your directional keys and to cancel it, you have to press a directional key to go to ""cancel"". Wow Ubisoft Shanghai; very good job.The hud is almost non existant. To go through vents or climb to areas, the game doesn't tell you or let you know that you can and cannot go to some areas. Guards spot Sam too easily and there aren't many areas to hide in. Guards can see through walls and objects. If you use cover and hide behind a wall, or whatever, a guard will keep saying, ""Did I just see something?"" and investigate. WOW! Do they have eyes that have thermal vision?I think the most frustrating thing is, the game is bugged!! In the second visit to JBA's HQ, I encountered 2 bugs;#1 a guard kept seeing a ghost and walking towards it. He actually may have heard a door that kept opening and closing by itself (strange). I won't tell the location in case you haven't played it yet because it's where objectives can be completed but he prevented Sam from getting closer to completing his goals and the only way I could make the spy complete them was to cheat using ghost mode to escape quickly.#2 A door that Sam had to go through was unable to be opened and I had to cheat to get through.Saves are useless because they cannot be loaded unless you load them from the menu. It takes so long for this game to load anything.Oh yeah, goggles are almost useless in this game. Nightvision will never be used because the game is too bright, thermal vision can hardly detect heat and wave vision will be used only sparingly.Because of the bugs and crazy AI, the game is too hard to get 100% on every mission even on Medium. The only ones I got 100% on my first playthrough were the JBA HQ missions.What a waste of time and money making this. It could have been much better if Ubisoft Shanghai wasn't involved. I would still recommend buying this if you don't care for getting the best score for every mission on your first playthrough and just playing it casually.			"

												Although I used to love this game as a kid and the retail version played perfectly fine on an old XP computer a couple years back, the Steam version is very badly optimized for newer systems (Vista/7) and a lot of bugs arise from using it, to the point where the game is rendered unplayable, either by crashes or simply by shadows not appearing on a stealth game?!! *facepalm* AND, the unoffical ""fix"" for that entails pixelated (not smooth as silk) shadows. This is 2013, I should be able to run this like it was supposed to run, thank you sir, but no. With that being said, as much as I loved the game (and still do, 'cause it was awesome, the whole Double Agent concept that is) what is the point of buying if I cannot run it properly? Boo.			"

												Originally played and beat this on the Xbox 360 when it came out, the PC version isn't much different.Offers typical Splinter Cell gameplay, but this time with a sort of ""semi hub-world"" where you go after each mission to try and perform espionage on a terrorist cell you're a part of.  Needless to say, this makes the game replayable and not replayable.  If you're actually interested in the story, it will give you time to earn different endings based on your actions in the game, but if you aren't, it will be a slog to go through each of these sections, only for you to earn a bad ending if you don't decide to do anything.The story gives a unique spin on the espionage missions though, and the levels are all very involved and enticing to play.  A step down from Chaos Theory, but still equal to or better than other entries in the series.			"

												  Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Double Agent is a game that i want to like, but I just can't. The bugs and glitches in this game are abundant and are a glaring problem. Add this with where autosaves and hard saves don't actually save, and you got yourself a piece of crap. I have given this game 7 chances (meaning I have restarted the game because of the issue with saves being deleted) and each time have recieved the same bugs and glitches.  Gameplay   Splinter Cell Double Agent is like every other Splinter Cell game. You stealth your way through each level and complete the set of objectives given to you without raising to much alarm or getting killed. Not to hard right? Well it is when game breaking bugs come into the picture. For example, in one level you are prompted to make mines, but before you start making the mines, you are supposed to listen to 2 people talk. I listened to the people talk, and when I went to make the mines, the mini game to make the mines didn't work properly. However, as little as I played, the game itself was an average stealth game. Graphics   The games graphics are average in my opinion. They aren't anything spectacular, but I can forgive it for how long ago it came out.   Story   The story is rather mediocre. It's a story that countless spy movies and game have copied and pasted for years now and it's not very creative. In my reviews I don't tell plot summary, so if you want to read the story, look it up or read the description for the game. Final Scores Gameplay: 7Graphics: 6Story: 4Overall: 5.7 "

												Really dissapointed with this game, I was a MASSIVE fan of the PS2 and PS3 versions, but this game on steam... It's just a terrible Port of the PS2 version. Also seem to be having problems with the multiplayer. I'd steer away from this, It has partly ruined my past memories of game :(			"

												**Update 9/2016: After playing the Gen 6 version (xbox/PS2) on an emulator I can confirm that the storyline is far superior and more developed in that version. Suprisingly, I read that ubisoft stated they were going to bring that version to PC, but changed to the next-gen version after protests from gamers who thought they were getting the inferior version. This is, of course, a lie from Ubi because they knew damn well which game was the more polished and made by the more experienced team, but the next-gen version had thier new fancy visuals that they had spent so much time on. It was in this moment, where they screwed their loyal fans to try and appeal to mainstream gamers, that this series went to hell. This could have been a single masterpiece for all platforms, but instead they decided to ♥♥♥♥ off players on each one. Ubi was never held accountable for this mess.**I have always been a major Tom Clancy fan and the SC series is really the only one still somewhat intact. At first glance this is just another sh***ty Ubisoft port, but if you take some time to make the proper tweaks to the configuration files ( I know its not the way it should be, but this game is worth it) than this game really becomes one of the best in the SC series and a proper PC version. It has that the same mechanics as Chaos Theory (variable speeds, lockpicking, hacking) with a very interesting plot and mission setup. I love wandering around the JBA HQ in-between missions and suddenly realizing your somewhere you shouldn't be and find a hidden objective, the game doesn't hold your hand through this you just have to figure it out. As always with SC play on the hardest difficulty for that super-tense experience. Refer to this page for graphic tweaks and other fixes:http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Tom_Clancy%27s_Splinter_Cell:_Double_AgentYou can also look up how to force 'ultra-high' settings, which are not guaranteed to work but do make this game look stunning for a 2006 release. If SC 7 is ever coming I hope the devs look back at this title and Chaos Theory, not Blacklist and Conviction which were still fun and gorgeous but didn't have as much focus on stealth and planning. I really hope we get Pandora Tommorow on Steam some day!			"

												***Anti-recommendation.***This is an incredibly bad port of the XBox360/PS3/Wii (Current-Gen) version and is riddled with unpatched bugs. Between this and the XBox/PS2/GameCube (Last-Gen) version with the same name, the Last-Gen version is better than the Current-Gen version by leaps and bounds.Stealth, once a delicate management of light and sound, has been dumbed down to a traffic light indicator of ""he probably can or can't see you.""The iconic night/thermal vision goggles which once defined this series have been rendered useless. The thermal mode has an effective radius of about 5 feet and can no longer see though thin doors or curtains. Night vision is little more than a pointless green filter which hardly gets any use due to the large number of daytime missions. For the most part, you'll just rely on your Soliton radar, anyway.Cutscenes used in both versions of this game are completely devoid of the context provided by the Last-Gen story and feel more or less shoehorned into the Current-Gen version. Subsequently, the entire set-up for the sequel, SC:Conviction, is barely even hinted at. The Last-Gen version, by contrast, made the character motivations for the sequel hook abundantly clear.If you want the stealth-based gameplay of the classic Splinter Cell, pick up the original or Chaos Theory. For the modern, Uncharted-style cover-based action shooter, just skip straight to Conviction.Avoid the Current-Gen version of Double Agent at all costs. Save yourself the trouble and just watch the Let's Play of both versions of this game on YouTube.			"

												alright ♥♥♥♥♥es let's right a review. I love the game, think it was cool when I played it as a kind on the xbox 360. After remembering that i never finished the  game on xbox 360 I bought it here.Couple things:- Game glitches to high hell. - Crashes so frequently - Deletes my ♥♥♥♥ing save game so I have to replay parts of missions that were either really tricky or boring, plus you can't skip cutscenes so I have to rewatch all the ♥♥♥♥ I already watched.- Stupid control mappings. I was stuck for so long trying to figure out why he was walking so ♥♥♥♥ing slow, turns out it was because you have to scroll with mouse to make him run, and even that is turtle speed.That's the kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that makes me hate this game, tbh it's not that bad of a game. Story is sort of cliche in certain areas, definetly not memorable. It does do some pretty cool mechanics with building trust and balancing the NSA and the JBA organizations, but other than that there isn't much too this game. I personally think it's not the greatest in the series but it's worth the time to play it. But for the love of god don't buy it on pc, its port is complete ♥♥♥♥.not recommended			"

												Couldn't finish the game to give proper thoughts because multiple glitches, bugs, and not so fun stuff.List of things I encountered.1.The PC version's default settings doesn't render half the lights!-First Level, a seemingly dark corner actually had a spotlight point RIGHT AT IT! I didn't know why I was ""visible"" until I tweaked the settings/ini files long enough to find out a lot of lights were default missing!2. Crashes3. Console controls on PC- Controls weren't optimized for WASD + Mouse.4. Game duplicates things if reloaded- A dead guy I killed in one run, screwed up, loaded a save.  His corpse was halfway through the ground with another guy patrolling on his corpse.  Reloaded.... now TWO corpses glitching on the ground.5.  Saves dont work- Most of my saves didn't work forcing me to restart the mission esp. quicksaves.  After pressing ""load"" nothing happens.6. World Geometry duplicates-Had a guard open a door, to have the door swing out as normal... but another copy of the door was still there closed.  The guard kept trying to walk forward.  Made stealth progression impossible, had to restart the level.  Killed the guy to check the door, and both doors were interactable.Just search for the First game and Chaos Theory, and you're good.This one... stay away... at least on PC.			"

												The game is alright. It follows a different detection system this time around, where GREEN = HIDDEN / YELLOW = NOT HIDDEN / RED = RUN FOR YOUR LIFE. Story is alright (of course will never top Chaos Theory)HOWEVER.This is probably the WORST port I've ever seen on PC. Constant crashing, saves corrupting, you'll have to meddle with the files to get lighting, effects, and specific resolutions to work, missing props, a whole mission (which is pretty annoying, it's set in broad daylight) you have to complete in one sitting or keep exiting to menu and coming back every time you fail or want to reload a checkpoint. If you REALLY want to play it, get it for the Xbox 360, since it was designed for it (ps3 port is also bad from what I hear). OR. You could get the ps2/xbox copy and play a completely different version of this game with more depth and closer gameplay to the originals.

												I loved Chaos Theory like a brother, but this might be the worst game I've ever played.It's not just the glitches and the crashes. Alpha Protocol was buggy (though not as buggy as this), but I still love that game. I can get past a few bugs, but this game was broken from its inception. It's muddled in terrible, dumbed-down, counter-intuitive design. It's an insult to the brilliant design in the previous three. The horrible PC port was just the icing on the cake.The first three games were reasonably paced, and emphasized a reliance on light and sound. If you were going to complete your mission, you needed to be a master of the shadows. In Double Agent, they dial it back to the lowest common denominator, and just make you hide behind conveniently placed objects. They try to pretend that light still plays a factor with a little yellow light on the back of your suit, but even when the light says you're concealed, enemies can still spot you from miles away. Direct concealment, and exploitation of predictable patrol patterns, is your only option out in the field.But it's out of the field where it really hits the fan. In the JBA headquarters, Sam is tasked with skulking around the base and completing tasks for both the NSA and JBA, but doing so requires mastery of one of the worst level layouts in history. If you remember that 3D map that you never used in Chaos Theory, just because it worked so poorly that the game was easier to navigate without it, you'd be happy to know that it makes a triumphant return in Double Agent. Prepare to squint like your life depended on it, as you try to make heads or tails of all the different branching paths that lead to dead ends, and plot a precise route to your objective, only to be sent back to the drawing board when you come across a secuity door, and need to plot a new route to whatever grand McGuffin will unlock it. None of this is even challenging at all, it's just unbelievably tedious.And that's my biggest problem with this game. It's so lazy, so insecure in its ability to give you a single, satisfying experience, that it just piles on busywork and hopes that'll keep you satiated. I do not play Splinter Cell to navigate through a cartoonish series of security doors, I play it for a challenging, satisfying stealth game. Double Agent is the complete opposite of everything the original three games stood for, and as a result, has none of what made them fun or interesting.It's a horrible game even if you forgive the bugs, but they're still well worth mentioning. The game crashes during every mission, mandatory safe-cracking minigames don't function in any capacity, the frame rate dips and the graphics glitch out even on systems well above the system requirements, one snow mission near the beginning will run for maybe five seconds before giving you a BSOD, and some events will flat-out fail to trigger.The first three Splinter Cell games had none of these problems (with the exception of a buggy shadow engine in Pandora Tomorrow, and one scripting bug in that same game that made me restart a level), and Chaos Theory somehow even had better graphics. Double Agent has no excuse. It's just a terrible game on every level.The only thing this game has that's even remotely interesting is its morality system, and it's bare-bones at best. It's not a moral dilemma if the numbers on your screen clearely dictate what's the right choice. You aren't making hard decisions, you're just balancing stat bars, and like all the other busywork in this game, that isn't any fun. I know I already mentioned this game, but Alpha Protocol had a far better idea of what espionage morality entailed, on top of just being better, more inspired, more fun, and more functional than this game on every count.Even for the more hardcore Splinter Cell fans, I wouldn't recommend this game. It's just horrible.			"

												This is so bizarre.  I remember having this game on Playstation 2 back in the day and having fond memories of it and yet people keep saying this is not nearly as good as Chaos Theory.  While Chaos Theory is amazing I recall Double Agent having most of the same mechanics and an interesting undercover element.  So I install it to give it one more playthrough only to see what everyone was fussing about.  This is NOT the game I played on PS2.  Not by a long shot.  The missions are all different.  The story, the gameplay... Everything dumbed down.  As a long time fan of this series I was always confused by how so many people said this wasn't a good game.  Now I see why.  PC Double Agent is a very different animal to the console Double Agent in every way.  All the things I liked about the PS2 version is not here.  I enjoyed this game but despite its flaws and unlike all the other Splinter Cell games I have no desire to ever touch this one again.  The biggest problem was just how hard it was to avoid being spotted.  Like when you thought you were well hiddent and it turns out you weren't and there's no chance seeing it coming.  Enemies can spot you miles away and will shoot you instantly with pinpoint accuracy.  Sometimes through walls.  The undercover aspect between missions where you sneak around the terrorists base to do things during a time limit has been significantly dumbed down as well.  Oh get spotted in a restricted area ""Fisher you're not supposed to be here"" with a little bump in trust.  I rememebr the stakes being much higher on PS2 with them shooting you on sight and better level design as well.  There just doesn't seem to be any tension in the stealth.   You either succesffully sneak through or you dont.  Half the time I would just go around a corner after being spotted and wait for the alert to go away after a second and its like nothing happened.  Oh noes my stealth score goes down?  I can't unlock gear that I'll never need?  pFFFFt say what you will about Conviction and Blacklist being more action oriented but at least those game's mechanics work well.Edit: I didn't even talk about the crappy interface and other issues that plague this game.  When spacebar is your action button for everything from opening doors to turning light switches to grabbing guards from behind it makes sense to have a prompt on screen to let you know exactly what you're about to do.  All the games before this had it simply say it at the bottom of the screen.  Here its shoved in your face in the middle of the screen as if to say ""YOU'RE ABOUT TO DO A THING JUST TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ADD AND CAN'T TELL""  As if thats not bad enough you can't use your mouse while hacking computers or reading emails.  You can't even type in the numbers when using a keypad lock!  Sometimes while opening safes it doesn't register the keys until you play with the mouse wheel for some reason.  Top it all off with glitches such as bodies flying away after you drop them completely destroying your efforts of hiding them.  On a couple occasions they just flopped around for minutes until enemies nearby noticed and i was screwed.  This doesn't even touch on the save issues when it doesn't read its own auto saves or in one mission reoloading a save causes the game to crash.  Its all these little problems littered throughought the game that just made it more of a hassle.  I mean Chaos Theory (the game before this) had gamepad support!  It didn't work very well.  It didn't register R2 and L2 on a PS3 controller but it was there.  This one has none.  Doesn't read the controller at all... How do you have so many downgrades?  Its so counter-intuitive to PC gaming when even the first Splinter Cell was more intuitive than this!!!!This is the only game in the series where I will say skip it.  If you can get an old copy of a console version in a bargain bin somewhere go for that.  That version is far superior to this extreme change for no reason.  Makes no sense why they made two completely different games for different platforms.  For all I know the Xbox version is even more different so I would play it safe and just find a PS2 if you must play every game in the series.			"

It was before Uplay so it has worse DRM and just plain wont load for most people, and those that get it working did so by fixing the game themselves and even then it crashes constantly.

												Double Agent follows in the same vein of gameplay as the original Splinter Cell, Pandora Tomorrow, and Chaos Theory.The graphics are amazing considering the year the game was released. However, you do have to do some manual editing of the game's system files to get it to full 1080p resolution.The biggest negative is that this game crashes a lot like a lot. That's the only disappointing aspect of the game.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! CRASHES TOO MUCH! SHAME ON STEAM FOR STILL SELLING IT!			"

												I spent an entire week trying to get this game to work - was it worth it? Kinda.Singleplayer is pretty linear and most of the levels are a drag; like who wants to sneak around in some African battlefield in broad daylight? Or hide behind tents and glaciers in Iceland? And don't get me started on those damn JBA missions...There are some cool levels like when you escape from prison or blow up a cruise ship, but it still doesn't suffice for how boring the earlier segments are. The ending level is the most excitement you'll get from this game but you'll probably be bored out of your mind before you can get to it :DOh, and I forgot to mention, you get to make choices in this game. None of it really matters, though, because you don't really care for anyone that your choice affects so you're basically trying to be good (NSA) or evil (JBA) for no real purpose except for the ending, and there's only 1 true ending to this game (which happens to be the ending everyone hates), so the others are baloney.Multiplayer is fun, probably the only redeeming thing this game has to offer but I won't go into that.Conclusion:Splinter Cell: DA is a subpar stealth game with a subpar story with subpar character with locations that are subpar for stealth -- but the multiplayer is good. 6/10Side Note: The console version of this game (PS2, Wii, Xbox) is amazing, almost as good as Chaos Theory.

												Poorly paced, full of bugs (including gamebreaking ones), difficult to tell what parts of the level are considered obscured and in the open, and no native support for 16:9 1080p resolutions even though Chaos Theory had it. They had some great ideas here but they're attached to a game that feels rushed and unpolished. I'd recommend you either get Chaos Theory or Blacklist, depending on which style you like, because at least both of those games actually function.			"

												So the first two evenly-numbered Splinter Cell games were tremendously uninspiring, delivering a same-old gameplay style with one or two new ""moves"", it's a fact; go look it up on wikipedia and metacritic, and if you find anything to the contrary, graciousy accept that I'm right al the same.So there's a plotline that Sam Fisher's daughter is dead, so he has taken on a deep-undercover mission with conflicting objectives slowly deciding his allegiances over the game's arc. The gameplay remains the same as chaos theory (much more careful, slow and intense play style based on stealth and misdirection, as opposed to just not being seen), and the art assets shine pretty well, but there's a massive feeling that this game is simply a contractual obligation as opposed to a creative game made for the fans.Also, just remember, this game led into the awesome conviction, with a tremendous storyline continuing on.If you can get this for a low price, do it, it is part of the set, but don't expect convition, blacklist or chaos theort.

												Almost ten years after its release, this game is still incredibly buggy. I suffered from the famous and seemingly unsolvable ""unlocked-gadget""-bug: Unlocked gadgets don't show up in the inventory and are hence not usable. This makes the game less fun as some of the gadgets are really cool. Also, the game is way harder this way because gadget advantages like speed-hacking or additional hacking time due to the upgraded hacking device can't be profited from.Another bug I encountered is the ""resolution bug"" that lets the game freeze during the last mission if the screen resolution is not 800x600. Seriously Ubisoft???Other bugs include missing savegames after restarting the game, forcing you to start missions all over again, etc...The game itself is decent. The morale feature is a neat upgrade and most of the missions are fun. The ""JBA-HQ""-missions (of which there are 4) are really annoying, however. They consist of playing boring mini games and then struggling to find the NSA objectives using the totally useless and heavily confusing 3D-map that ""features"" dancing labels as you rotate, making it completely impossible to precisely pinpoint an objective's location.Bottom line: The game is okay despite the fact that a third of the missions are crap. But the fact that Ubisoft releases such an unfinished piece of software and fails to patch it into a playable state within a decade is simply pathetic.			"

												In short, this is one of the buggiest, glitchies worst games I've ever played. Usually the splinter cell games are awesome, but not this one. The past games have all been great, and the games after this one were great aswell, but this one had truley awful gameplay. Other than the gameplay, it was a good game, but why play  a game with awful gameplay? the shaders are broken, making it impossible to know if you'll still be in the shadow when you're in a dark hallway with enemies, expect sound to randomly cut out too, making it impossible to know if you make alot of noise where you're walking, or if enemies are shooting at you. and the ending... oh wait, I never got to the ending because one of the characters glitched making the game impossible to beat, as in, he wouldn't walk up the stairs during a scripted event to trigger the credits, I had to look up how it ended to have context during conviction! But, other than that, it is a good game, the characters are good, and the story is good as usual. With that being said, just go youtube a playthrough rather than wasteing 10 dollars one this broken mess.			"

												This port of Splinter Cell is, like the other Splinter Cell games on Steam, real terrible.  The control setup is awful.  'Enter' is your function key, which for a WASD + Mouse setup is untenable.  Ubi continues to fail to understand PC gaming, indicated by their terrible default control schemes(C for crouch?  Shift for jump?  COME ON).  This Use key is LOCKED and cannot be changed, which is just stupid and a little insulting(let me set my controls however I wish, I'm not dumb.  You don't know better than me).  The game runs ok, but it feels like I'm trying to wrangle my character instead of control him.  The Assassin's Creed games did PC controls much better, I don't know how they can possibly miss the mark by so much.			"

												Broken Cell Double AgentAfter owning the first Splinter Cell for years but never finished it. I then bought the first 3 Splinter Cells on PC and finished all three of them a couple of years ago. Each one was fantastic though I felt that the shadows in Pandora Tomorrow were a little off but otherwise good. The game that stood out of the three however was Chaos Theory with hardly anything to critise about it. It had brilliant stealth mechanics, a great soundtrack, great level design, good story, supposedly good co-op (haven't played it) and of course the legendary spies vs mercs mode.After three amazing titles, you would expect the 4th installment of the series to be able to live up to its predecessors right? Wrong!This game makes me rage in so many ways! The game feels rushed and unfished, the first game had good stealth mechanics, it beats this in terms of stealth mechanics by far which means that this isn't just a step back, this is a few jumps backwards. There are rarely any proper shadows in this which means that the only way you can tell if you're invisible is by looking at the indicator either on your back or in the bottom left hand corner of your screen; if it is green you're invisible, if it's yellow, you are visible and are at risk of being detected and if you are red then you better run mofo because you're about to get your backside handed to you.This sounds like an okay system and may have been more acceptable had the light metres in the previous games never existed, but the problem with it is that the shadows aren't dark enough most of the time like they were in the previous titles which makes running into the shadows game of chance as either it will hide you or it won't, it's not obvious when you're about to enter an invisible area and because of this, I was constantly being detected in absolutely rediculous ways which was not fun at all and because of this I was constantly autosaving way more than I would of needed to in the earlier splinter cells, I think on average I autosaved about 55 times per level.The story however is actually good and I did enjoy it, what this game does offer that the previous titles did not were the ability to make choices in the game and making those choices would result in different outcomes which would give the game more replay value if the gameplay wasn't so bad.But one of the biggest problems I have with the game is it's incredibly bad PC port, it is so sloppy despite it being the same version of the game as the xbox 360 and the PS3. Why is it so bad? it crashes constantly for no reason and I have quite a high spec 3 month old pc and this is 2014, the game is so badly optimised and it is absolutely outrageous that ubisoft haven't fixed it, I'd hate to think what would happen if I were to run this on my old computer with 10 year old hardware.The menu system in the game is annoying and every time you want to hack into a computer or look under a door, you have to watch this stupid animation on your opsat which lasts 3 seconds, that might not sound that bad but when you have to watch it so regularly and it's the same animation over and over again it really gets frustrating.I've also heard that Spies Vs Mercs was completely ruined in double agent which is just another reason not to like the game so just throwing that out there.Oh, and every time you either want to hack a safe or the mine assembly (both of which are annoying events that you have to do), make sure that you are in running mode as the game was so badly ported from console that when you try and do this whilst in walking mode, your controls to crack the safe or assemble the mines will simply not work.The only thing I can praise about the game are it's graphics and it's story oh and about that! I finished the last level last night and it loaded a cutscene in game, but the AI kept getting stuck on one of the textures which means that the cutscene was just stuck and my camera was stuck on the guy who was stuck and kept clipping through the catwalk so basically, I couldn't actually finish the game properly and so I had to look up the endings on youtube, absolutely redicolous given how old this game is now!One other thing I forgot to mention is that for the JBA which is the organisation you're working for but are actually a double agent, you have to visit and carry out objectives within their safehouse 4 times! 4 times! That's just repetitive and it's confusing trying to get to know your way around it especially for the final level seeing as the map on your opsat is just plain awful.So all in all, this game is worth playing I believe, but not on PC. Get Double Agent Version 1 on Xbox 360 or PS3 but not PC, it is just too buggy and it will annoy the hell out of you otherwise!One final note, there are actually two versions of Double agent, version 1 is on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC and version 2 is on Xbox, PS2, gamecube and wii. Version two was done by Ubisoft Montreal and as a result, I've been told that version 2 is much much better than version 1 and it is a completely different game with a completely different level layout even though they share the same name, apparently it feels more like Chaos Theory so I can't wait to check that out at some point.The bugs in this game make it unacceptable and it is a dissapointment given how great the last splinter cell was, only thing that holds it up are the graphics, the story, voice acting and I guess the level design.All in all, this game gets a 4/10 for me on PC as even though the story was very good, the gameplay was littered with bugs, bad stealth mechanics and felt nothing like its predecessors.

												Terrible. An insult to the series. Missions are very poorly designed and often don't make sense. For example, to help a prison ""friend"" escape to a helicopter which is crawling with police, do you defeat the police? No. Do you sneak around them? No. You have to stand in a specific spot, away from the copter. What?The interface is extremely annoying, too. You have to sit through long animations just to see dialog. Want to see text in a menu? Watch the characters spin around randomely for a while until they ""form"" their sentences. Everything about the user interface is about wasting your time and delaying doing the simplest tasks.This game isn't worth your time even if you get it for free. Spend your money elsewhere.			"

It's a completely broken product and it's just there in the steam store, danling over our heads like a worm on a hook, baiting us to spend our money. I'm not going to say that Steam is actively trying to rip off their clientel, but I will point out that this it is irresponsible for them to continue selling this trainwreck of a product to people who are willing to play it.

												Game has a lot of game-braking glitches, that occur later in the game like broken safe minigame, that makes some safes Unopenable, minimap is very disorienting and objectives are extremely unclear. Undercover mechanics are a bit broken but they add some replay value, but you probably won't have too much fun. One more personal grudge I have with the game is a lack of SC pistol ammunition, since you get only 20 rounds per mission and I couldn't find any more. I know that ammo is limited because this is a stealth game, but I love to go on little rampages in splinter cell games even though I know it's not a solid method. Overall I would love to like the game but I just can't. Glitches ruin everything, I don't like the story, and limited SC pistol ammo.			"

												Into Stealth? This is definitely for you! I started playing Splinter Cell my freshman year of high school and I fell in love with the gaming genre of stealth. This game really captured the drama that was needed in the franchise. Sam Fisher's downfall and change into a rogue agent was a good step forward for Ubisoft. There is a good amount of intensity in this game, there were times where I would be hiding in lockers or in the shadows with my heart beating as I narrowly dodged those metaphorical bullets. I liked the morality aspect of the game as well, even though it didn't mean much. Mercenaries was also entertaining and intense.			"

												This is probably the buggiest game I've ever played. I generally don't write reviews, but I wanted to compile a list of the issues I've faced, along with some advice.Before anything you should get the 1.02a patch from here : http://patches.ubi.com/splinter_cell_double_agent/splinter_cell_double_agent_1_02a.exeThis patch is not included in the steam version and already fixes some issues.1) It will crash. There's no real way around it. It WILL crash. However, 99% of all crashes happen during loading, so once a loading is done you shouldn't get too many crashes (I've had one or two in my entire playthrough). The crashes are extremely random, and to get past them you need to try loading a save multiple times, until it finally succeeds. If you look up how to resolve this problem, you might find people saying that you need to launch the game with a '-ll' option. This is useless and only made the game crash a bit faster for me. Sometimes adding '/safemode' to the game's launch command seemed to get around some persistant crashes (although it could be a simple coincidence). To do this, simply right-click on the game in your steam game list, select 'properties', and click 'set launch options'. There you can add or remove '/safemode'.At the very begining of the game I had a crash a few seconds after loading a game, which was solved when I tried using a third party patch to fix widescreen support (http://thirteenag.github.io/wfp#splintercell). Again, this might be a coincidence.2) I strongly advise against trying Windows' compatibility mode. I tried it and it only made the game start dropping some FPS' every few seconds.3) In some areas in the game you can get stuck (especially when you are crouching). To avoid trouble you should save often.4) In some areas in the game you can instantly die if you save there and load the save. Again, to avoid trouble you should save often.5) At some places you will have to pick some locks. Probably due to porting the game to PC, there is a glitch during lockpicking : you need Sam to be at maximum speed to be able to pick locks (scroll mouse wheel up).6) At some point, when selecting 'continue' in the main menu, the game said that no valid save files were found, but all I had to do was going to the 'load' section and saves were still here.All in all, you should avoid this game if you're not too patient, as it can be irritating to launch it 3 times in a row for it to randomly succeed and load correctly.

												I really wanted to like this game.  The level designs and concepts were great.  But the huge number of bugs/glitches/annoyances managed to suck all the fun out of this game.  I regularly I had to do internet searches on how to get around various problems so that I could progress in the game.The game crashes frequently.  And the saves sometimes get into some sort of corrupted state so that you have no choice but find a previous save (if you have one) and replay parts of the game.And if the save system wasn't so bad, this could be tolerable.  But quick saves don't work at all (apparently related to what drive you have the game installed on).  So you have to do manual saves and the saves don't get any sort of name and just appear in an unnecessarily small window (can see 4 at a time) in a random order (not even by save date) -- a total pain if you need to find the 2nd or 3rd last save so that you can replay to work around a problem.And the final level was just a travesty.  The game crashed in so many places and saves got corrupted.  You work around all of that and then you finally difuse the bomb and then the game just freezes -- nothing.  You have to use task manager to shut down the game and restart yet again.  Then finally found out that you had to change screen resolution to 800x600 just before you completed the final task so that could see the final cutscene and progess to the bonus mission.I can't believe that a product ever got released like this and obviously received such little support from the developers.  I don't really care whether this was Steam's fault, the publisher's fault or the developer's fault.  But the result is that a potentially very engaging game has become an epic fail.			"

												Great game but buy it on Xbox 360 if you want a bugless version. Also for reasons I don't know, certain graphics such as shadows and textures are missing or unexplainably low. These problems aren't present in any other port. The PC port is capped at 30fps and doesn't support widescreen without hacks, something that was present in the previous game. If you want splitscreen multiplayer, buy it on PS3. The Xbox 360 version is missing it, which is odd, because the demo on Xbox Live has fully functioning splitscreen.If possible/you have a 6th gen console/you liked Chaos Theory/You already played this, buy the 5th gen version instead for Xbox, PS2, or Gamecube. The screenshots in the steam store page are from that version, which shares the story in common and is otherwise a completely different game, that is an experience more like Chaos Theory, rather than a new game engine (All games are Unreal Engine 2, but Chaos Theory, and the 5th gen version of DA use one version, while the 6th gen/PC version of DA use a rewritten version of UE2).This game is great but suffers from being a rushed PC port, and suffers from being misleading (Nonsteam advertisements also used media from the 5th gen versions)			"

												One of my two favorite splinter cell games but is buggy as ♥♥♥♥ on pc. Saving, except for quick saving, is pretty tedious and buggy; guards will keep repeating ""What was that?"" a million times in a row. Sometimes the guards will stick themselves right where you need to go and be stuck there. I would just strongly recommend getting this game on console if you can, but if you can't and have to struggle through it like me, then I wish you a time without raging at how annoying the bugs are.Update: I defused the bomb in the JBA head quarters on mission 10 and it would not continue. It showed the two SWAT members approaching the room that I diffused the bomb in, and they just kept spazing out, glitching all of the place. I re-loaded it like 4 times and then validated my game cache. It found 3 files that failed to validate and when it was done, it removed my save on that mission. I am so freaking done. I struggled through all of the buggy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t long enough and for nothing. I STRONGLY suggest not buying this game on steam and enjoying it on the consoles as it was perfect in every way on the consoles.			"

												Well, the game why itself is good. Not as good as Chaos Theory, but a full Splinter Cell, and the idea of being a Double Agent is interesting and refreshing, just like the story (always inside the typical Tom Clancy's plots). The controls adapt well in PC, so is full playable with mouse and keyboard.The problem? The PC version is full of bugs. At least i'm lucky enought and the game din't become unplayable, but others aren't so lucky.I recomend? Well, if you can't play that on ps3/xbox360, you can try the PC version, and maybe, you will enjoy some good Splinter Cell, but if you have a ps3/xbox 360, buy it on Console.			"

												A sadly great Game plagued by Bugs and Glitches on the New-Gen Consoles of the Time (PS3 and X360), this was not helped by a VERY dodgy PC Port which suffers from constant Crashes, Control Issues with Keyboard and Mouse (Minigames etc. not working properly) and certain Graphics Settings not applying, it is worse in Multiplayer, where you are not able to change your Resolution or your Controls in the slightest, making this the ultimately poorest in the Splinter Cell Series (Next to Conviction).BUT, there is Absolution, if you buy the PS2 Version of this Game (The Old-Gen Version) you get a vastly different Game than the New-Gen Version, that one has better Controls, Gameplay and feels better than the New-Gen Version, get that instead.If you still want a taste of this Version of the Game, do so with Caution, i personally enjoyed my Experience			"

												Good news: Great story with very little noticable bugs (I hardly notice 'em); bad news: overall performance. Ubisoft Shanghai did not take into account that the performance of one profile SHOULD NOT merge with or effect another profile! For instance, if I accidentally killed a worker on the Iceland level, then that death will effect the percentage of my overall performance; and, I'll decide to make another profile in order to try to get 100% stealth again. After I make a new profile, and I beat the Iceland level again, the kill penalty will be counted against the new profile!If you care more about storyline than the buggy performance percentage, then this is the game for you! However, if you're the type that wants to try 100% stealth all the way, then I recommend watching Centerstrain01's 100% stealth walkthroughs before playing; he is quite helpful. Keep in mind that Centerstrain01 played Double Agent on Hard. https://www.youtube.com/user/Centerstrain01 "

												The best SC game in the series. Featuring plot twist and side missions that affects the story line. Stay true to the SC tradition of stealthly game play without action hero BS (I'm looking at you SC:Conviction).			"

												It really looks as if the developer and studio really didn't care, and it resulted in a low quality game that is by far the weakest in the series. For example, the textures in Kinshasa looked so low res, I seriously question if it was pulled from the PS2 port (Oh wait that level wasn't in the PS2 version). One of the details that bugged me thoughout the game was the fact that your rifle is suppressed, yet the game designers failed to model a suppressor on the rifle (Seriously, look at screen shots). The porting job for this game was so badly done, it's riddled with bugs. The AI pathing was so buggy, that the ending cut scene wasn't able to trigger. So I never actually saw the end of the game.The story is weak. The character you encounter are forgettable. The worst part is, the story in the game is canon, so it directly ties into SC Conviction, which is actually a pretty good game. However, I couldn't recommend playing this game, even if it's just to see what happened prior to the SC Conviction. If you bought Conviction and you want to know what happened, save your money and read the spoilers on some website instead.			"

												Old splinter cell mechanics, old graphics and the campaign story is not really interesting.Given the fact that the saga kind of rebooted after this opus, I wouldn't recommend to play it, except if you are a fan of the old splinter cells and you want to finish old Sam Fisher's story.The only positive point is about the double agent thing, but overall, it's never that complicated to stick to the chosen side, as the game doesn't really offer some hard choices situation.Rating : 8/20 (beware that the last mission bugs on win8 as the cutscene gets stuck...)

												Please, do yourself a favor and do not purchase this game from steam. Allow me to be as clear as possible. I purchased this game from gamestop years ago and the game ran just fine. What's wrong with the steam version? Let's see: Constant crashes, resolution fixed at 1280x900, screen flickering, and did I mention the crashes? All in all it feels like I am playing a pirated version of the game. There are no achievements or cards for the game. I'm going to sit here and guarantee you that the pirate version of the game runs 100% better than the steam version.			"

												Was a decent game back in the day but now it's a clunky mess which is partly because of the awful PC port controls. Tutorial levels are completely broken as well as far as I know.

												This is the most unique game in the series and yet its muddled with bugs and performance issues. Crashes frequently, textures look worse than the original Splinter Cell and its filled with game breaking bugs and glitches. I encountered a bug right at the end and I couldn't complete the game.

												The amount of trouble I went through just to get a controller to work with this game..Double Agent is a terrible port for the PC. If your come fresh off of playing chaos theory then this will give you a major headace. Constant crashes, glitches, and bugs. I manages to finally get through this game after multiple reboots and level restarting. My suggestion, is to save the game after every major action or every two minutes.  I really just wanted to play this for the story. I found it to be pretty fun trying to figure out the inner workings of the JBA. Beyond that though, if it were any other story I wouldn't have even bothered downloading it.			"

												This game looks and plays impressively for the year it was madel; but unfortunately in my case the settings for both in-game and in Windows 7 OS to adjust the specific setting of ""Mouse Sensitivity Level (0-100)."" Even with all settings down to ZERO the in game function of the mouse is WAY TOO FAST making the game impossible to play effectively.If that were solved, the game never fails to freeze (old school syle) the display would stop and the game would become unresponsive to any command specifically when Sam FIsher is told to choose whether to execute and man being held prisoner in the locked room. These problems prevent me from enjoying what seems to be a overall great part of the Tom Clancy's Stealth franchise but the acutual gameplay on pc platform can be a bit touchy and fails to preform everytime I attempt to pass the 'freeze scene'.

												Not compatible with Windows 10, at least this is my case. I got crash when loading, I got crash when grabing NPCs, got crash when shuting down the game, and it is ""very persisting on staying foreground when it is crash."" Hell, I am starting to consider Deadly Premonition steam version is even better than SCDA's steam version. I haven't mention the bug that won't get the game crash, such as unopenable doors(force the player to cheat in order to move on), ambigious light indicator (apparently Fisher decide to do most of the secret mission during daylight for more challenging task.) I don't know why I bother to finish it, but I did. And the ending bug is what really amazes me how bad this game can go. I feel bad for anyone who waits for ubi to fix all these bugs. It has been 10 yearsIf you really want to finish your SC collection, get SCDA on console.			"

												I played the game before (not on staem) and run into issues like force closing when loading or saving. I saw that it was on sale a week ago and thought that I sjould give it a try. After all, there are a few (VERY FEW) reports that the game runs well.I was mistaken. The game froze twice when loading the tutorial and had to ctrl-alt-del my way out of it.When i started the first mission, it crashed again when quick loading (the game exe stopped working message). I will ask for a refund, watch the game on youtube maybe and will try to buy a used ps2 or an old xbox in order to play it (though I despise gamepads on this game - wish consoles could use mouse and keyboard).Don't bother with getting this game. It is broken beyond repair.			"

												I wasn't a really big fan of Double Agent at original release, but that's because Chaos Theory set my expectations so high! I picked this steam copy up in a Splinter Cell bundle (that doesn't include Pandora Tomorrow, but there are ways around that issue..) and I've been working my way through the series with my Xbox One controller and a fistful of INI adjustments.At least until I got to SC:DA.Nothing except the wired 360 controller will work; apparently it's an Unreal Engine 3 issue. Graphics are, well, glitchy. But I threw the towel in when, after all my effort in trying to have a 'playable experience', the game spits the dummy on the next startup and refuses to acknowledge I'd ever saved! Not happy.I would recommend buying or bartering an old Xbox 360, that probably comes with a wireless controller and a handful of old games, and playing SC:DA on that. Possibly even for less than the retail price below. Heck, if MS gets on the ball then maybe we'll see DA become backwards compatible, or better yet free on Games with Gold - and then everyone can share the love on the Xbox One instead.Because there's no way we should be suffering this crap on PC.
