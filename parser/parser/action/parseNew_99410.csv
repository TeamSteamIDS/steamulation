												Despite the bad reviews, I found the first Garshasp game to be a fun hack and slash.  This game, however, is horrible.  Almost unplayable for the bad camera angles and glitches.  At only 2 hrs long, I found that I couldn't wait for it to be over.  STAY AWAY!			"

												This game lacks effort and polish, it feels like more of an old tech demo than anything. You can complete the game in less than 2 hours but I couldn't stick with it long enough to do even that. Terrible voice acting, mumbled sounds, poor attack and movement mechanics, and lack of an interesting story make this a game that should be avoided. Look at this still from the opening cutscene in the game and you'll get an idea of what you will exerience when playing:


The facial expressions are worse than the voice acting. That's saying something!

												I installed, finished and uninstalled this game already. This is basicly a 3D platform/hack'n'slash and the most terrible game i've ever played. There's not a single part of this game which isn't ♥♥♥♥ed up. The story, the characters (all 3 of them - 2 npc + you), the graphic, the controls, the camera handling, etc., even the puzzles cursed by the terrible controls, still the puzzles are the best parts of this game. If you wonder how hard is this game, it isn't. The most common cause of death will be falling from high places. I died dozens of times from falling while died only once during battle (if i dont count when i fell trough the floor in a battle once). And the most annoying part of all is the balance, because there isn't any, based on the steam counter it took me 2,5 hour to beat game, but from it only the final boss fight was more than half an hour. Because that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cheating as hell and i especially hate when developers use this kinda trick to extend the games length. I was so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥after a while, i started for looking cheats, unfortunately i didn't found any.There are no options, so you can't do anything besides playing. Also you can't  skip the end credits, so you're forced to watch every name whos are responsible for wasting 2-3 hour from you life. Also as a fun fact you can see how much people need to make a terrible game.0/10			"

												The prequel to the ""Garshasp: The Monster Slayer"" game.While the game is very short, 1,5 - 2hrs to beat it, I experienced the same dull combat like in the predecessor, but level design that is even more uninspired, more FPS drops, more bugs, and hilariously bad writing and cutscenes (the opening animation is comedy gold: ""Well at least let's take a rest.

												Literally one of the worst games I have ever played with one redeeming value: It is mercifully short. If it did not crash or softlock so often, probably less than 1,5 hours, maybe even 1 hour.Everything I could say has been said: Terrible controls, laughable animations with dated graphics, a camera that is actively fighting the player.The first game was not that bad, even if it gave me a bluescreen and was dead after I saved my computer, I was only 15 minutes from finishing that. This one on the other hand is an insult to players. Trust the reviews, do not waste your time.			"

												i really enjoyd the first garshasp so i tought i would play thisone. my first impression was this doesnt look like a sequel. i tought the first one was better but then again i playd it so long ago and just began thisone. performance is somewhat odd, getting frame drops here and there, NOT braking unplayable but non the less noticeable. i play it with xbox 360 pad and everything is great exept for the game not using xbox buttons on screen when action cutscenes show up and u need to press a specific button. That leaves you guessing what button needs to be pressed and makes you die and repeat until you figure it out. The game seems to have more puzzles than the first one, im barely starting it and already have had several simple puzzles. im positive once i learn the buttons i will enjoy the rest of the game very much. OH my only real complaint is  the camera is so bad, very bad, it will point the camera to the worse position it can and it will move it at the worse moment possible. very annoying... I was looking for a onscreen button mod/fix for the 360 pad to show correct buttons on screen and found many people on the discussion section saying the game doesnt work for them or very bad performance. I had no problem installing or running the game on windows 8 x64. there was definitly some lazy work done because i do get slight frame drops that shouldn't happen on a game with these kind of visuals. shame on you DEADMAGE group for that. and its the reason i am not recomending the game.

												This game plays as if it was created by a 13 year old pubescent virgin. The cut scenes appear to be thrown together; graphics were crappy, dialogue was poorly written, and the voice acting was attrocious (almost sounds like the voices were computer generated as opposed to being voiced by a real human). The gameplay was bland, combat felt clunky with the keyboard and mouse, but improves with a controler. I'd say that the controller support is one of the few highlights of the game. It's clear that this game had a low budget. Low budget games don't have to be bad. I've played plenty of low budget games that had incredible gameplay and imaginitive stories (vvvvvv is one that comes to mind). It sort of feels like dead mage blew the entire budget on graphics at the expense of every other aspect of game play. I realize that I probably spent more time downloading this game than actually playing it; however, if someone had a gun to my head forcing me to play this game or die, I'd probably rip the gun out of my captor's hands and take my own life.

Lets start with the positive, The Graphics in the game is not bad, and work well with the game. The Story is ok.  now we get to the game killing aspects of the game for me. The controls are mediocare at best, what makes this worse is that the game changes the camera angle in some instances making it worse, this is componded since you cant change the angle (as far as i could tell).  I played the game as long as I could hoping that it would get better it just got worse. I promptly removed the game off my computer.

												I think the first thing I want to say is that Garshasp: Temple Of The Dragon is more or less a standalone DLC to its bigger brother Garshasp: The Monster Slayer. I said more or less because the game and the store page doesn't call it that of course, but it takes place before the story of The Monster Slayer and I think it's something to keep in mind about Temple Of The Dragon.Storywise the game's premise is pretty simple: Garshasp and his brother are looking for a legendary mace that is hidden somewhere in a jungle, near the temple of the dragon.And that is about it.After a short cutscene you're walking, jumping and fighting as Garshasp through the levels, just like in many other action or spectacle fighter games and just like in The Monster Slayer.Fighting is based on a combo-system between heavy and light attacks with an added counter-function, where you can initiate counter-attacks if timed correctly. There is also a rage-meter, that fills whenever Garshasp takes damage and can be used up by unleashing powerful attacks. I seldomly used these, so I can't really say too much about their effectiveness.Enemies you'll encounter range from small creatures fighting in groups to large hulking monsters, but only a few of them require different strategies. In comparison to The Monster Slayer there are a also a few new enemies, which help keep fights interesting.Every defeated enemy grants you a few experience points which allow you to unlock a few more combo-attacks, however I'm not sure how many unlockable attacks there are.Experience points can also be gathered by red orbs on altars which are located throughout the levels.Similiarly to these red orbs, there are also blue orbs, which will re-fill your health bar. There are also other blue orbs which are not placed on altars and finding a few of them will grant you a larger health bar. These are however placed in more hidden areas.A few times throughout Temple Of The Dragon there are also a few platforming segments, that thankfully appear a lot less in comparison to The Monster Slayer. I say thankfully because the overall movement (and fighting to a degree because of that, too) is a bit clunky, especially the jumping. I also played the game with mouse and keyboard so I hadn't access to analog movement, but I had no problem making it through these segments.The reason I'm playing through such a game like Garshasp with mouse and keyboard instead of a gamepad is that it doesn't feature gamepad button prompts as far as I know.From time to time you will also find notes from a journal by Garshasp's father (if I remember correctly). These give you a few background informations about the area or the mace itself. However just like in The Monster Slayer I find it hard to follow the persian mythology lore that the game is based on, as many characters have names that are a bit confusing for me to remember. Collected journal entries are read to the player by a voice over as the texts are not written in English. My guess is these are actually written in some old language or they are simply made to look like old scripture.The game itself is very linear and also uses a fixed camera system which can be a bit annoying at a few places, but nothing too frustrating. You will also always be moving in and around the temple of the dragon, but pretty much never move through the same path twice, which I think is pretty cool as it keeps even a strongly linear game like Garshasp a bit interesting.Graphically Temple Of The Dragon doesn't really impress, however it features a style that I would call consistent throughout its levels. Similiar to The Monster Slayer it still has points during the game however where the performance will drop under the 30 frames per second mark, but thankfully outside of action sequences.I should also mention that I encountered a few bugs during my playthrough but nothing a return to a checkpoint wouldn't fix.All in all it is an alright game I would say. Combat and movement is still clunky like it was in The Monster Slayer.However I can't recommend it. Not because it is a downright bad game, it isn't. As I said, it's alright. It's just that it isn't very long and there a many other games in the genre that are way better (for example the Prince Of Persia games) and will provide you with a better time overall.So in the end I guess it comes down to this: If you really liked Garshasp: The Monster Slayer and you want more Garshasp buy Temple Of The Dragon during the next sale, just don't expect large improvements. If you really want to try a Garshasp game, go and buy The Monster Slayer during the next sale, simply for the reason that it is longer and both Garshasp titles cost the same.To end this review I would however still say that Garshasp: Temple Of The Dragon feels more polished in comparison to The Monster Slayer. Not by much, but it's shorter length certainly helps keep things a bit more fresh throughout the game.			"

												I'm not sure what's more surprising, the fact that this game exists or the fact that I gleefully bought it. The first game was crappy, but had a kind of charm that transcended it. This one is just♥♥♥♥♥♥ It runs terrible. Averaging around 21fps on graphics that a Dreamcast could do with ease. The first one was short, but this was barely even over an hour long. The combat is mindless and the 'puzzles'  were a joke. I do not recommend this game. It sucks.			"

												- Decent controls with combos- Simple puzzles- Bad camera angles (you have no control over camera)- Boring story and voice acting- Very, very short (took me 100 minutes to complete)- Still somewhat fun to playOverall I can't recommend buying it. It simply doesn't offer enough to be a good game.			"
