												Tactical Intervention is a multiplayer FPS developed by Minh ""Gooseman"" Le who earlier co-developed counter-strike. This does seem like a good way to make a comeback but Tactical Intervention suffers some major drawbacks.The game itself seems just like a standard multiplayer FPS. You get a gun wich you then run around and shoot people in the head with and eventually get shot in the head yourself. Seems fairly simple right? But the game got these nice little small details wich varies from using a fire extinguisher to put up a smoke wall to being able to roll away from explosions and thereby prevent taking damage. This is according to myself the only positive point of the entire game.The gameplay is also one of the worst of modern day FPS games. It's not that it's bad but it's just nothing special.And don't get me started on the animations. Everyone looks like crabs when they walk around! And with just around 500 ppl in game at the time this is written? The game has been out for less than a year and the community is alredy dying out.As a F2P title the game functions as a good example of a Pay 2 Win game (P2W). This means that the people who pay for stuff in the game (be it a more powerful weapon or even dogs) can totally dominate the people who don't. So someone who is far more skilled may get totally rolled over by someone far less skilled just because the far lessed skilled guy has put more money on the table.PROS+ Good ideas that later FPS games may improve+ Better than COD+ So bad it's funny if you're in the right moodCONS- P2W- Laughable animations- The community is barely aliveOVERALL SCORE 32/100			"

												It used to have potential, now it's just a failure. I could write a book on my experience, but in short. They took some advice, and the advice they took they only incorperated a quarter of it. They did not listen to the core community on things like gamemode tweeks, and tournaments and it left, now the ones who stay are playing in the kiddie pool pretending it's an ocean. This game could have been great, now it's too mangled to be enjoyable even with the innovative gameplay features like repelling and cars.			"

												Tactical Intervention.Not tactical at all.So this game is... a bit weird. It's not good... but it ain't bad either. It DOES have some potential to be a good game, but... it's not going that way... much.And it's not tactical at all, it's a free-to-play ""Counter-Strike"" ... ""styled"" ... game... ? It's not a slow game, it's the opposite actually - it's a bit fast, but not CoD fast or Quake fast.Right off the bat I'll say that the shooting is really weird, it's jerky and awkward to get used to. The network part of the game is horrendously bad, and there's some optimisation issues (it's Source engine for ♥♥♥♥'s sake, how can you mess up that?)But it's still VERY ♥♥♥♥ING FUNThe best mode in the entire game must be the VIP Car Escort, which is a car chase on a few maps (so far 3 exist), which are pretty big, and you just have to drive forward.Driving isn't as simple as it sounds, the handling is unlike any other game with cars. It's a bit hard to learn but it comes fast.So while you drive, you occassionally stumble upon green boxes, which can heal you, your passengers, repair your ride a bit (dunno about that one actually) and have a surprise weapon like a grenade launcher or RPG which is a round changer most of the time.It's unfriendly to new people, because there's a bunch of menu options and sections where you just get confused how everything works, and most of the mechanics are explained through VERY simple tips during the loading screen. The best way to learn is in practice.Get a friend or two or a pack of them, grab some alcohol (optional), go with your friends on one team and play the game. It can be enjoyable.tl;dr:+- weird shooting, can♥♥♥♥♥♥you off+- weird driving, makes you laugh sometimes+ car chase best mode- borderline if not crossing the pay2win line- unbalanced weaponry--- heavy armor ffs nerf that♥♥♥♥♥♥br>++ awkwardly fun with friends+++ gore- network stuff			"

												*The game is now released so this review might not be fitting anymore, but of what ive seen of it since its release is that its only gotten better in my opinion.*First id like to say that this game is currently in Open Beta state, so dont expect much from it.Ive got to say i actually really like this game, it has lots of potentional. It has this Counter-Strike feel to it, which i love, such as: No ADS (Aim Down Sights), Recoil and more. I like it because im a huge fan of the Counter-Strike series and just VALVe games in general, theyre genius. I like the ideas they have put into this game like the gamemode where you can drive a car. The game doesnt have amazing graphics, but i dont expect more from a F2P FPS (Free to Play - First Person Shooter) game really.The first time i played it, it was quite confusing, but it didnt take long before i had a ton of fun in it.A thing i also like about this game is thats its not Pay2Win, even though you can use real money to get kind of better weapons, it doesnt ruin the game at all. I, myself, use the P90, and ive bought it for lifetime for in-game money, and it works perfectly fine against AK's and M4's even, its pretty well balanced.All in all i think id rate it a 8/10. <- Open beta rating.*I will now change this to a 9/10 because of full release.*End thoughts:The gamemode with the cars could use some polishing, it can be quite glitchy driving into each other and stuff, but im not sure if it can get fixed, its still fun though.*This has been more polished now and works better.*The recoil when you spray could be a lot better, because it seems like you deal 0% damage if you spray, even when it says i hit the enemy when i spray, i dont get assist if somebody else kills him. Even though you dont spray in a game like this, it still needs to get improved. If you think the recoil is bad and the game is hard, its just because you need to train, its like Counter-Strike, you need to double-tap instead of spraying.*The spraying and dealing no damage thing seems to have been improved, but its still there in som cases, be aware of this.*But well, awesome game in my opinion, give it a try and if you dont like it after the first 5 minutes, play some more, it will get better. But if it doesnt, i guess its not the game for you. Its F2P (Free to Play) and you dont have to use actual money to play it. Its also made in the Source Engine, which is my favourite engine, love it.Nice game, highly recommended.			"

												I liked the trailer, but the first time I played it. Just got me downtrodden.I didnt quite enjoy the game. I would prefer counter strike more than this. Sure the running, the rappeling, the riding on vehicles are fun, but hell was it buggy. (Did I mention that the driving physics will wish you never took a seat in the game because you know teams will kick you out for it?). Plus the aiming was preposterous.The game was like an upgrade of the oldest CS, but lazily done and gave up on.. The maps were good and the controls were nice. But the gameplay just makes it seem bad. Guns are ridiculously expensive and having them expire is even more so. I wouldn't even dare buy one gun which I can permantly have for how much it is. Not a suggested game for players with bad internet.			"

Quick SummaryA Counter-Strike-esque FPS with some newer functions.Purchase Verdict:  Free, but probably not worth tryingPoints of Interest-Dying/dead community. Online games will be limited due to this.-Pay-2-Win at its core. Want a nicer gun? Have fun playing four hundred hours to get enough in-game currency, while other people pay cash for it instantly.-Interesting car chase gamemodes and rappeling mechanics, but otherwise a worse verion of counter-strike. -Graphics are of poor quality for a newer game. It does not appear to be possible to attain the quaility of graphics as seen in the trailer.			"

												For those of you that dont know, the creator of Tactical Intervention is also the Co-Creator of Counter-Strike. Valve bought the rights to Counter-Strike then hired him and his team, which they later worked on Counter-Strike: Source. Following Counter-Strike: Source, Minh ""Gooseman"" Le, left Valve to go and work on his own games. One of the games was this trash called Tactical Intervention. Talk about poor career choices. On the bright side Gooseman now works for Facepunch.			"

												Terrible gameplay, horrible motions, atrocious driving physics and quite unplayable at its current state.Tactical Intervention looks more likely to be in Alpha version, with some questionable amateurish programming issues.But for some reasons, I keep coming back, every now and then, to check the regularly made improvements.The game has a very solid potential nonetheless with amazing features, and could offer a truly groundbreaking FPS if everything click.Command attack dogs, deploy breaching charges, perform drive-bys quickscopes and control hostage situations. Experience the thrill of rappelling down a building, kicking in the plexiglass, hurling a flash bang, using extinguishers, grabbing a hostage as a human shield. "

												The game is okay in some sense, the only trouble i have with it is that it is not super obvious which servers have high level OP players and others that have low level players.It can ruin your experiance if you join a game and the enemy team has like possibly 3 players in lvl 30 and they do all the killing whilst the low levels on that team just dmg you and then the OP ones finish you off or they kill you solo, as they are wearing bulletproof helmets and body armor that well protects them too well, the starter weapons are alright but the best thing to do first is buy one guy permanantly and possibly a new pistol, i went with the MP5 the pistol though i forgot the name, game is slightly easy to learn but hard it CAN be tactical if you well work with a friend and crouch walk silencing your footsteps and leaning around corners before entering an area, the only major downside is if the map is close quarters expect A LOT of shotgunners, as they will and always will 1 shot you no matter what so if you hear footsteps (if you are deaf or not) then be sure to fire first as if someone sprints or opens fire they will appear as a red dot on your circle like radar, very handy though as it will well...be your ""wallhack"" you could say so whenever someone sprints towards your direction you can snap at the location of the dot and be instantly ready since everyone in this game sprints like a mad man on drugs.The thing i dislike the most about this game is that the starter weapons are not that useful against someone who has all the gear already by buying items, like the m1 is terrible and it's best to stick with the skorpion the shotgun is alright but sometimes it's bad in all ways, i majorly dislike the default starter sniper as well it's too shakey i assume the sniper everyone uses the ASO or whatever has no breathing on it and it's 100% steady all the time as the sniper will 1 shot you like the AWP in Counter Strike, it's very hard to get used to the recoil sometimes so when playing TDM and you join quickly in the warm up, try out the recoil BEFORE you get into a fight so you know how many shots you can fire before going sky high with recoil.The propane tanks and such in this game are slightly useful as the fire extinguisher will be a free and easy smoke screen and flashbang somewhat, so if you assume enemy is around corner you can make your own smoke screen cover then if he runs through it you can ""flashbang"" him with the smoke, it's also useful if you shoot it near an enemy whom has not used their fire extinguisher to i assume kill them or blind them, the propane tanks though i dislike slightly as all they do is spin around and damage you slightly and knock you back, i assumed they would blow up after a certain time limit but that's up to those gas cans which i assume you cannot move at all and can only kick.The hostages in this game are a pain though as when playing the hostage capture mode on round 1, you have to capture all hostages or save them to win or just kill the enemy team which everyone does, losing EXP for killing a civi is however dumb though as in the car chase modes it will happen often due to it being hard to drive somewhat, i also dislike how it's hard to keep track of hostages since they can wander away and the T's are on a limited playing field while CT's however can roam around freely, if this was CS everyone can move around freely and not be restricted, i would like however if you could see the sharpshooters that will kill you if you try to leave the area, then if you kill them you can roam around freely.I however dislike the killstreak items as it will be impossible to get the m249 or rpg even the grenade launcher, all a rushing player could get is a flashbang and tear gas before he/she dies, yet tactical players will be able to get almost everything in the special rewards area, the kill streaks however would be useful on a FFA not a TDM, TDM is very very annoying since you could join servers where is up to rank 9 or lower and a rank 3 or 6 could have good gear since they bought it and it will be slightly unfair, i would like though that if a player has body armour they could have some what of a unique model or something.The problem this game has is that you possibly ""gain"" accuracy if you stay with allies yet everyone rushes and stays away from each other like this is CS, yet it is not and is a much harder or easier version of CS so they only survive for about a second or two, though the accuracy gain is not super visible i assume that the 3 little bars on your crosshair mean your accuracy gain, so it must mean that it gets majorly worse as you stick with allies or something since it feels like that, i must say though if it is a gain then it should be gained by 5% so if you and a friend stay close you gain 5% accuracy boost, the larger the squad the better which will greatly help let's say a sniper or a player with an LMG.The rolling in this game is sort of useful if you are crouching when facing an enemy and roll away or back, i assume they think you are dead and stop firing for a second or they miss all their shots due to bad connection or something, it can be useful if you use it right, never attempt to sprint away when getting shot as it means wasting stamina and insta death, it is much faster and easier to roll, though you will not see it happen very often in this game since everyone sprints, dies, see's nade sprints away instead of rolling since it reduces damage taken.Blind fire however is not useful at all since if the weapon viewmodel is aiming at let's say the table that you are hiding behind you wont shoot over it and will hit the table instead, this feature however gets unused A LOT.The voice commands in this game are not very...useful the reason is because they are all icons, for taking fire it's a man on fire which does not make sense at all, if this was CS:GO or CSS you would have much more voice commands and more options to command the team, in this game you can only say, medic, follow, roger, you lead, under fire, cover me and that's it. not very useful if you dislike typing to command a team, i also must say i dislike how the characters don't have unique voices like CT's should have a serious swat voiced person whilst T's have a somewhat i assume inexperienced terrorist voice or trained terrorist, something along those lines as the voice lines are always the same guy on either team.The auto voice command whenever a player is low on hp is very stupid and bad, i assume only allies can hear it but it would be better if it was more of a cry for help rather than a low quiet voice of ""patch me up"" ""I need a medic"" would make the game more realistic in some way if EVERYONE could hear it though, so if an enemy player is low on HP next to an ally he would attempt to whisper for a medic next to him but under fire he would scream at the top of his lungs for a medic, so they could hear him over the gun fire and same with the players attacking the enemy.The grenades and weapons in this game do need to be improved, i would like if i could DROP my weapon for the enemy weapon on all modes of gameplay which could allow a player to try out let's say a M4 shotgun or something, the grenades though need a fix on them though as flashbangs will blind you no matter what, i threw a flashbang down a hallway and looked away yet to still only be blinded by it, also the tear gas is very useful and unuseful, sometimes the smoke for it will bug out and not show how big the AOF is so you will wander into it without knowing, the fire nade however is too OP if you use it right, as if someone wanders into the fire for a second to back away quickly they will die too fast, it would be better if it did slow damage on the player if they were out of the fire yet crazy damage whilst in the fire, also the character models in this game are okay but it would be better if you could pick between 3 models when you start off.

												Tactical Intervention is...interesting. While not being tactical in any way, it does live up to its name; being an intervention. While many people are on a high from Counter Strike, and CS:GO, T.I. seems like a very possible alternative to dive into. However, even with its decent map design and solid mission modes; T.I. fails in many regards. Keep in mind, this is a free game.Game Play synopsis -  - pay to win does not always win. I found that after a couple hours playing, years back, i could stand my own with an M4 and buying light armor with the in-game points. *Save your GP*  - Shotguns = the noob cannon. I find the best way to deal with these players, is to just stay away. There is always some off chance that a stray bullet with decide to fly across the map and nail you with a headshot. However, the gore and carnage that is left in their path is quite enjoyable to watch.   - invest in a decent pair of boots. Speed is key, and with no universal speed, the ones who can run are the ones who can survive.  - camping is possible but hard to pull off. The feature to spot where your attacker killed you from is a great advantage. *it takes certain skill to defend a corner*  - Spawn time is 10 seconds. Longer than most games, such as C.S. and the instant respawn in a deathmatch.  - The damage stats are garbage. You’ll see damage carry over from previous kills. Upwards of 200, 300, etc. In many cases, 150 damage could be beaten by 140. The number of shots again follows this logic…..oh wait, there is no logic because it makes NO SENSE!  - This game is all about how well you can tolerate those annoying players who live in the middle of nowhere with a ping of +600 and can kill you instantly because they are clipping harder than the Microsoft Word Helper in a paperclip factory.  - You’ll be bombarded by rage quitters, “you’re a 10 yr old boy!” comments, loud music being blasted over the voice chat, and also, the always appreciated, “?how do to change class” stupid questions.------------------------------------------------------------------------------General Review:- Good game- Its FREE- Minimal disk space required- Minimal hardware specs to run at a decent frame rate. - Not for those who easily rage- Slightly cartoonish graphics------------------------------------------------------------------------------Rage Scale-O-Meter:6/10Quality:6.5/10Support:5/10Overall:6.6/10**Remember, it’s a FREE game!!** "

												Never played this game but Steam said that I actually did so instead of judging the game here's a cool way to make skinny guacamoles with homemade baked tortilla chips :Skinny Guacamole:2 medium green sweet peppers2 medium fresh poblano chile peppers1 bulb garlic1/2 teaspoon olive oil2 roma tomatoes, seeded and chopped1 serrano pepper, minced2 medium ripe avocados, halved, seeded, peeled, and diced1 teaspoon lime zest2 tablespoons lime juice1/2 teaspoon saltBaked Tortilla Chips:Corn tortillasOlive oil spraySaltFor the guacamole:Preheat oven to 425° F. Line a 15 x 10 x 1-inch baking pan with foil; set aside. Quarter, stem, and seed the peppers. Place pepper quarters, cut sides down, in the prepared pan. Cut off the top half inch of the garlic bulb to expose ends of individual cloves. Leaving garlic bulb whole, remove any loose, papery outer layers. Place bulb, cut end up, on a double thickness of foil. Drizzle with the oil. Bring foil up around bulb and fold edges together to loosely enclose. Place foil packet on the pan with the peppers.Roast peppers and garlic for 20 to 30 minutes or until pepper skins are charred and garlic cloves feel soft. Allow to cool about 15 minutes. When garlic head is cool enough to handle, squeeze garlic paste out of the individual cloves.In a food processor combine roasted pepper quarters and the garlic paste. Cover and pulse until combined, but still slightly chunky.In a large bowl, combine tomatoes and serrano pepper. Add roasted pepper and garlic combination and stir to combine. Add diced avocado, lime zest, lime juice, and salt. Gently toss to combine.Serve immediately or cover the surface with plastic wrap and chill for up to 1 hour.For the chips:Cut corn tortillas into wedges and place on a foil-lined baking sheet. Spray lightly with olive oil spray and season with salt, to taste.Bake in a 350° F oven for 8-10 minutes or until lightly golden brown.			"

												I spent over 100 hours on this game, but that was a couple of years ago, 'Tactical Intervention' was my first Steam game, at first I reckoned it was one hell of an amazing game until I started playing CSGO, back in the day the game was well balanced and a bit buggy, the Asia server was pretty popular, things went well during aniversaries they would give you what I think was 50,000 free credits to blow on anything you like; I decided to get back into this game a few months a go only to come to the realisation of, REMOVED SERVERS; now I can't even have any fun with this game unless I have to put up 300-400 ping on an American/European server. On another note, with a limited budget the game has seemingly been abandoned by it's developers.Far worse than what it looks like.- Rating 3/10			"

												I don't know what to write, so here's the recipe for chocolate chip cookies: Ingredients 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar3/4 cup sugar2 large eggs1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract1 (12-ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips, or chunks2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour3/4 teaspoon baking soda1 teaspoon fine salt Directions Evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days. For a  Rocky Road  Bar Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.) Cool, cut and serve.			"

												 you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients- To Make the Dough375 grams (3 cups) plain flour1/2 teaspoon salt2 eggs1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) waterExtra flour for dusting - To Make Cheese Filling15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.1/2 cup cheddar cheese2 eggs, lightly beaten1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon pepper- ExtrasYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)Parmesan cheeseBasilFried vegetablesShrimpFish slicesChicken pieces Make the Ravioli filling.- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough.- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!

												One of the better F2P games here on Steam that isn't in a P2W model. TI is a CS clone by one of the original co-creators of Counter-Strike, Minh ""Goosemen"" Le. So that is to say, a round based FPS hipshooter, involving hostages, bombs, and the escorting of the VIP (Player or AI depending on which level). Pro's  Equipment: Dogs, C4, Riot/Glass Shield, Sniper Rifles, and Armour (All usable in most mission modes). Weapon attachment: Silencer, Flashlight, Acog, Red-Dot, and Holosight (rentable bi-weekly for GP) . Some small perk variations possibilities, extra ammo, XP and GP accuisition, Medkit (rentable weekly for GP). Every gun and piece of equipment is purchasable for permanent with GP, except for Medium and Heavy Armour,  which are rent only. Cars on a few maps!  Lean-tos (Peak and lean mechanic done with Q or E) of which function in the car, allowing for some Dukes of Haphazard spray and pray. A slight sway when scoped in with the Acog attachement or sniper rifles. Team healing (Defaultly set as the T button), albeit unrealistic, but it's no medpack laying in a corner!  Other game modes such as Deathmatch, Free-for-All, and Intel. DLC for custom skins Friendly Fire Cons  Friendly Fire (Some rounds it just needs to be turned to Mirrored rather than Full or Partial... or worse, off) Lack of a tutorial level or a ranked server load for that initial level 1 learning curve (you may get bit swimming with those sharks). No Ironsights! NO IRONSIGHTS!!! rent the Acog Scope attachment already.  The two dogs from the DLC starterpacks have a 4% bonus to one of their 3 stats, being the exception to the P2W model (no other ingame money only bonuses though). Small player base currently, so some issues with which servers are being used due to the low player base.Consider this review a recruitment poster... Uncle Spam needs you!!!			"

												Having played hundreds of hours, I have to say that this is one of my favorites of all time. Sure its got glitches here and there, but in the end who really cares? Where else can you drive around blasting each other on your way to hand off or intercept a package?So the graphics aren't as slick as COD, but you know what? The game play is a million times better. If you only play games for the most up to date cpu intensive graphics, then go away. Many decry ""pay to win"". The game works by accepting cash, or in game points to get better equipment or weapons. You start the game with 50K game points, enough to rent out some serious kit, or permanently buy a decent weapon and some extra equipment. You get more GP by doing well in the game. You can get all the equipment you need by playing for a while and saving up points. The only folks who complain are those who want instant gratification. I got everyhting I ever needed not spending a penny, but have supported the developers by buying some DLC items now and then. Believe me, there are folks who spend a bundle on the best weapons, and they aren't winning.Maybe there are beter games out there for deathmatch, but thats not what makes this game shine. It's the mission mode folks, where you and your team must complete missions, or thwart others from completing their misions. Team play is encouraged, by requiring members to heal each other rather thrn thmselves. And sticking in a group is a force multiplier by increasing the teams accuracy. Don't listen to the whiners, read a guide and get in the game. Don't be a tool, help your team and behave likea human. If you get pwned a bunch early on, so what? You gonna rage quit because someone shot you in a FPS game? Go play something else, like jewel quest.graphics: 6/10gameplay: 10/10audio: 7/10			"

												Edit: Decided to reavualate this game after picking it up again.Gameplay:- Solid gunplay- Variety of guns (smg, assault rifles, snipers, shotguns)- Easy to understand controls- Server browser can suck sometimes (doesn't refresh, hard to click servers at times)Currency (GP):- Grindy at times, 150-300 GP per round in Mission Mode- Some equipment (mostly cosmetic) has to be purchased through your Steam Wallet- ""Renting"" Guns can be a good tool to try out before buying- The price of guns is somewhat high, although SMG's are a solid purchase for being so inexpensiveCommunity:- No one uses Mics, either a good or bad thing depending on your preference- Not much cooperaton, unless playing with friends (I highly recommend)- Although the game rewards sticking together, there's always one or two ""snipers"" not doing much- Some elitism at higher ranks, although it could be worse (See MOBA's)With solid gameplay, a decent community, and a somewhat grindy currency filled with in-game purchases, the game could be executed better, but if you put the flaws aside you have a well made and enjoyable game.I suggest downloading it, and trying it out if you enjoy 'tactical' fps games!

												I know this F2P is sorta old, but I was curious on how broken this game is and by god is it broken as♥♥♥♥♥♥ but entertaining at the same time. The gameplay and controls are so damn clunky and the weapon models are like basic gamebanana skin models. The weapons recoil are absolutely ridiculous. When shooting at an enemy it's pretty much trial and error on whether you get to get the kill or get killed so accuracy is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. I wouldn't call this a tactical game as it still seems like the whole run and gun♥♥♥♥♥♥ The worst thing that does make the game terribad are the connectivity issues. Earlier when I first played this I had no issues until later on this evening when I've been losing connection to host every 4, 5, 6, 7 times in a row. I'm not sure whether it has to do witht he host rage quitting or just terrible TI servers. If it really is lobby hosts rage quitting causing the connection to be lose then thats some terrible lobby development there. While the game has a lot of negatives in it, the game does feel a bit entertaining sometimes. There are a few fun and silly game modes that you can really enjoy. Once you get use to the gameplay you'll get better and better at it, but the game can be too boring if you're that good. I sorta half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥this one, but if you want a real tactical arcade challenge then play Counter-Strike. If you want a real Tactical Shooter then play Rainbow Six 3, Ghost Recon, Insurgency, or SWAT 4. Give this a go if you like, but I wouldn't recommend this game. Be best to avoid it due to♥♥♥♥♥♥connectivity.			"

												Stop thinking this is pay-to-win, because it isn't. This may be a cheap Counter-Strike clone, but the additional features are what keep me coming back for more. With dogs, car chases, VIP escorts, hostage/civilian rescue/capture and plenty of weapons to keep me interested. While you can pay for guns with real money, there's also the option of paying with Game Points (GP) which doesn't cost you a penny of real cash, just time spent playing the game. This game may require some grinding but once you get past that stage, there's nothing but good times to be had.I must say though, I do wish more Europeans played as the American servers can be a bit laggy which of course restricts gameplay. Just give it a go, it's free-to-play and if you do decide to invest some cash into the game, atleast you'll know it's not as much as you'd spend on those damn CS:GO chests.			"

												This game, you can like it. And you can hate it.I hate it. Don't ask ""Why, why?!"" Because I'm explaining everything. The game mechanics and the actual gameplay isn't that bad, there is blind firing, human shields, rolling, and upgrades and in game money. And levels. The game characters are ugly, it looks like they took max payne from 2000 and just retextured it. Seriously, this is 2013 and the Game Developers aren't even trying. And it was made by the co creator of CSS! Oh well. The weapon and level system isn't that bad, except the guns they give you at the starting suck incredibly, and when you buy a better weapon, you can only most of the time only afford to keep it for a week (Ahem, 7 days). The gamemodes are terrible, well, most of them anyway. Two of them are from CS, CSS, and CS:GO, Hostage Rescue, and Plant and Defuse, which is elimination mode most of the time, then there is objective mode which is the hardest and probably the funest, there is three maps, one is hostage rescue, another has a car driving map, and another where you just break in buildings and walk on walls.Conclusion:The game is not bad, and I would say you give it a try.Unless you hate terrible graphics, say goodbye.

(Athough it has a lack of real gameplay)But at least that had gameplay, unlike this usless waste of time. I feel sorry for the people that made this game, because they wasted a lot of time and money making it.And, Who the hell is wasting money for weapons on this?! And P.S There should be NO such thing as a better weapon in a Multiplayer Game, it makes pretty much.. NO sense.So do I recomend this? Yes!

												After saying this about the game : Its a great game. with good character models and the maps are very nice to play and have a good looking texture.for this game u need a better PC than you need for CS:GO because this game ask more of the PC and videocard than CS:GO does. but in this game u get more stuff than in CS:GO u can make her ur own inventory and choose the character that u want. this isnt possible in CS:GO. but CS:GO dont have lagg for me, but this game does cuz of the 25-30 FPS i get. (because i have a crap PC with a normal PC you dont have lagg) The Character models and weapons are very good looking. especially the Character models compared to CS:GO are way better. also the stock weapons look better than in CS:GO+ points : Good Character Models, Nice Maps, Nice Weapons. Good Skins.- points : asks a lot of the PC, My PC get fast hot. (but i have crap pc). and a bit lagg for me cuz of my pcis my mind changed after the last update (27 July) and am i retired of this game..To start with why i have quitted :A.  This game has tons of lagg at least tons of people that lagg. because the : Russian, Asian, Arabian and also European people are joining the USA Servers,  for some European people is the ping or lagg okay in USA (100-140 ping) but with ping above that. stop playing in USA ♥♥♥♥tards.  go back to the server of your own world piece like (Africa, Asian, Ocean, some European and RUSSIAN)B.  before the update on 25th April was this game perfect. the HItmarks were great. the lagg was less. and a lot better Frames Per Second. so to go on after the update on 25th April my game was ♥♥♥♥ed up. learnt the game again and the hitmarks were good to do again... but the update on 27th July (last update) actually destroyed this game for real.  The HItmarks are sucking, the FPS is a lot less and the lagg gets more and more. I prefer and some other guys to get the game back before the big update in April. C. The Players.  BEFORE the big update in April had this game sometimes over 400+ players. but atleast 300+ .  then after the update somewhere in the middle this game became having : 200-250 maximum.  now after the update in July this game just have 140-180 maximum.  means the devs ruin this game with the updates that makes this game less good (like : giving less FPS. getting more lagg, and ruin the hitmarks) or the game is just this boring...D.  since this game just have 140-180 people maximum playing at the same time are there less clans active. the only (big) clans that are a bit active to keep this game active are : aQ, MVP, some Gamer Junkies, Machete and some of the Expanse.  all other clans retired of lost to many players to call it a clan like : ||R.E.D||, RPZX, DaC, DOD, GODz, RSF, PATI, DIY, myP. T.S.F and myP. Lan-b,  Hellas, EsP, QB,  Kriptex (felt apart, some members retired but some merched with Shini, KWA and are now Machete) sorry if i forgot any clan that also retired.  then also players like : linimicus, Tornado and Luda retired. means this game gets less and less players. we have to get the players back with restoring the lagg, repair the FPS and the big deal : fix this hitmarks again.IT WAS A GOOD GAME BEFORE THE UPDATE ON 25th APRIL. SO FIX THIS GAME BACK TO THEN. AND SOME PLAYERS PROBABLY WILL BE BACK ON.. IF THIS DON'T GET CHANGED THEN I WILL SAY : THANKS DEVS FOR RUINING THIS GAME.FOR NOW I HAD NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME. BUT WHEN THEY CHANGE THE GAME BACK TO BEFORE APRIL I HAD RECOMMEND THIS GAME.			"

												[The following is a post that I made in a forum discussion for this game.]Holy ♥♥♥♥ I just came back from playing this, and let me just say that it was so mediocre and seriously undeveloped that I've uninstalled it. The playerbase basically consists of little prebubescent kids screaming ""LOL IM RANDOM ARENT I FUNNY FOR THAT LOL"" ""KOOLAID I LIKE LEMONADE"" ""WOW LOL GG HASHTAGS"" [literal quotes im not even joking]. The modeling for the maps and playermodels are blocky and have an extremely outdated feel to it [like op said]. Graphics, obviously, are not the aspect that truly make a game a well made one [for example: n64/sega genesis games like Goldeneye 007, Ocarina Of Time, Toejam And Earl (which I think im the only one here that remembers it), Sonic, etc]. I was gonna list some PS2 games, but a majority of titles for that console have had in the past, and even today, decent graphics. To bring Tactical Intervention onto that topic: Even if you were to upgrade the game in every single visually appealing way, the gamemodes would still suck major ♥♥♥♥. The most time I spent on a gamemode was Team Deathmatch, the total amount of time being about 20 minutes, until I got way too bored. Tactical Intervention gives me a feeling that it was put on Steam for free as a desperate attempt to revive itself, much like WolfTeam did with Aeria Games. To explain: WolfTeam was ♥♥♥♥ing amazing to me and most people back then. Me and my friends would go on it and glitch through the maps and get kills to get other guys to rage, and even just playing the game vanilla style was pretty damn fun. Well, a few years later, and now it's a sellout with practically abandoned servers and a ton of moneygrabbing tactics to feed the develepors inflating money-grabbing corrupted egos. Looking back on it, the whole WolfTeam getup was good for when it was released, but hell no would it achieve greatness ever again. It's the same concept with this online game: Tactical Intervention was probably, like, the best thing ever when it was in its earlier days. Now all it has left is Steam to back it up to hopefully bring some of the glory back the cheapest way possible. Anyways, to finish off, Tactical Intervention is a game that is ♥♥♥♥ed up in all corners, bringing a ♥♥♥♥ton of errors along with it.*bows* That is all.			"

 Introduction (you can skip this part, kinda) So, I picked this thing up on a warm sunny day in June, I believe and on this day I had loads of fun with it, mostly with the Autobahn level, which was a pretty fun mess of a level, and sadly one of the only fun ones, as I noticed a few months later. Gameplay  Now, here comes the sad part. The weapons are unbalanced and if that wouldn't be enough, the handling is just awful, both of those factors prove well how less of an idea the developers actually had in mind while making this. It is a lot of fun in the first 1-2 hours but then slowly turns into frustration, while you try to grind your way up to a less ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapon, which is already hard as most of the servers are empty. Maps Honestly, besides the original ideas with the two or maybe even three car levels nothing really original is on any of the maps, neither gameplay- nor stylewise. Most of them are just boring and ugly. Graphics To keep it short: They are bad and somehow make the game run really badly. Conclusion The game is dying right now, if the developer not starts doing something it might very well be completely dead in a month. I would not recommend you playing this game, as the weapons and maps are already pretty bad and not just that but will probably even run badly on your PC. 3/10 -incomplete garbage "

												I would NOT recommend this game to casual players or to FPS newbies. The game requires a lot of participation and time (or money) to become good enough to compete with regular players. One of the best parts of this game is the community. It requires effort and patience to become a meaningful part of that community, but once you know how to play the game and know your teammates, it's just plain FUN!Original review: ""I wish I could recommend this game, but unfortunately the Devs have neglected the most important part of it: Anti-cheat.In a pay to win game like this, you can't allow hacking or cheating of any type. Omega has consistently failed to address this issue. For years. I love this game, but I wouldn't recommend it to any new players.""Addendum:I wrote this review late at night when I was crabby after running into a couple speed ""hacks"" (ping discrepency?) and I failed to mention any of the things that I love about this game. Thank you for Bilbur and Plat for checking me on that. I'm leaving the original review, partly to explain and partly to encourage me not to write a review like this again.I don't have evidence for my complaint about cheating, just my game-play experience. It's unfair of me to call out Omega for this one issue when he has been working to improve the game and release content since I first started playing. There are a few issues (such as the water lag in Office and the positioning of hit boxes) that have persisted through several updates. It seems to me that Omega and Fix Games have prioritized new content over these other issues. I would say that the new content improves the game and adds strategic depth, but these issues still need to be addressed.I DO love this game and play a lot, and I do not plan to stop playing it or to stop supporting the game financially. I want VAC because I think the community suffers without it. Because I'm an established player with gear and the experience to use it, I can usually hold my own against any opponent, even one using injectors or other exploits. It's hard enough to play against experienced players as a newb without adding the frustration of dealing with cheaters and trolls/griefers. If you do put the time and effort in, this game is very rewarding. I love the community and the game is just FUN once you learn it.

												The negative reviews consist entirely of misinformed people saying that the game is pay to win.it's not.In the start of the game, you get 50k GP, enough to buy a really good AR like the AK47, permanently.You can also get other items such as equipment, for a small amount of GP as well.Before you write a review on any F2P game, please educate yourself in the game before claiming it be P2W or filled with microtransactions.

												Being closely involved with CS since it's inception,  when I heard that Gooseman had created a new game I was very interested.  This game has a feel of the original CS.  Unfortunately, this game becomes very lopsided in a hurry as equipment and perks are acquired by higher skill level players making them impossible to beat by players on entry levels.  The micro payment system is also difficult to endure, as well as the long delay between maps.  As well, there are too many items that must be purchased with real money and cannot be earned by game points.  I am referring to tactic altering weapons and accessories including supressors, red dot sights, custom skins, and armor - all of which are available if you're willing to spend $7 to $12  per item and for only a limited 30 days use (for all cool items except for skin cheats which only need be purchased once).  What disappointed me quite a bit is the artistic license the devs decided to take with weapons whose character and standard configurations are sacred in the gaming community.  Everyone knows, for example, that the Steyr Aug's receiver casting includes an integrated 1.5x telescopic sight housing fitted for lenses made by Swarovski Optik.  We pretty much all know that the Aug sight contains a simple black ring reticle with a basic rangefinder.  Curiously, the developers of TI decided to remove the integrated 1.5x sight on the only Steyr Aug that you can acquire in-game on a permanent basis.  The REAL Aug equipped with the standard fixed optical sight can only be acquired when  on a temporary basis when playing TI, and this can only be achieved via a micro transaction of real cash - and you will have to buy said Aug as an item in a  weapons crate  containing a bunch of accessories you don't really need or want - tough♥♥♥♥♥♥- but don't worry about acquiring too much clutter in your arsenal cause all items you get in your crate somehow vanish after 30 days.  That's 30 calendar days, not 30 playing days. Makes me wonder why the developers didn't also program the cars to  transform into pumpkins  at precisely midnight, may as well have the VIP turn into Cindarella holding a mop bucket too.  Which midnight? Good question.  It's midnight once an hour somewhere on the planet.  Insideously,  armor cannot be permanently purchased ever.    What makes me start violently gnashing my teeth is when I am reminded once again --> the items which can only be permanently acquired via micro transaction of real cash are essentially game changing legal cheats.  Yes, I said it, cheats, which I loosely define as advantages that are not available to all players - unless they have cash they are willing or able to hand over via the micro payment system.  Thes advantages these items purchase give players an immediate decided boost, tilting the playing field dramatically.  I can hear many of you now, tsk tsk tsking me, come on now Attrition, do you REALLY want to call these guys out and accuse them of haxoring - they are after all, performing within the framework set up by the developers after all....come on now, I can't imagine it, please, Attrition, describe these cheats of which you speak.   Okay.  I'll touch on one (or two) -  Here's a no brainer: the alternate terrorist skins available for purchase only cause a terrorist appear almost identical to a CT.  Can you look me in the eye and tell me it's cool by you if you're playing as a CT and another CT appears on your screen, when you ignore them since they look like your own team mates and derp derp!! Dead.  You just got PWND. You must be a noob cause you got killed by the guy you mistook for a CT, in a skin that cannot be obtained by game points, only with cash - and once purchased remains in inventory forever.  How about a weapon cheat - you may not call it one but essentially it is when using the Super V SMG.  IRL, Kriss Corporation currently has only built the Vector Super V chambered in .45 ACP with a 5.5"" long barrel as the only length availabe in the automatic version.  Kriss says the effective range of this weapon is 45 yards, and even at that distance you're looking at a 37"" bullet drop.  In Ti, this SMG is more powerful at distances greater than you can accurately damage using the M4 or AK chambered at 5.56mm and 7.65 x 30 respectively.  The Super V feels as if it's about twice as powerful than the MP7 - and at close range that's understandable, provided the target is NOT wearing body armor.  However, in TI the MP7 doesn't penetrate body armor like the Super V does which makes absolutely no sense.  Basically there's no reason to buy any other gun than the Super V - and most likely one of the TI assbeef devs has a personal copy of the civilian model of the Kriss at home (available for only $599 in usa) where he keeps it in his closet, but at night he comes out of the closet with the proof of his virility and manhood, and  enjoys holding his own SUPER V in front of the full length mirror in his parents basement (where he lives) threateningly posed while admiring himself in the mirror while wearing only underpants and mirrored sunglasses.  Gotta be the reason it's so over powered. Gotta be.The Deathmatch I don't like at all, it's good for the mentally challenged who cannot put together two brain cells long enough to consider such a thing as team work...but at least the spawn points were well thought out.  In deathmatch the server ""admin"" gets to limit weapons selection - so you may be forced to play with only pistols for instance.  --->WHO THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO NOT ALLOW THIS FEATURE IN MISSION MODE?!?!?!  I OUGHTA SLAP YOU WITH A TROUT!!!! <---If  Mihn Le had been actually involved developing this game he'd have certainly pushed for a single one time purchase and let players earn perks that don't give them such huge advantages over other players, and he would have understood that the chat window should be easier to read must  stay open longer.  Mihn would have realized immediately how important community involvement is for the success and longevity of any multiplayer game, and this game would more interesting and attract more people for a longer time.  As it is there is zero community involvement because the Server binaries are not released to the public which means you're never going to run your own TI server where you'll be able to kick and ban the punks - an absolute requirement in multi-player online gaming enjoyment.  This also means that the degree of aimbotters and wallhackers has increased dramatically.  And why wouldn't it?  There's no VAC guard, as weak as that is, and no admins to kick punks from servers where they rack up scores of 44 and 0 AS A LEVEL 1 experience player.  WTF?  Really?  Last, the most egregious crap  in this game is the way teams become stacked all the timeand it's silly.  On just about every single room you'll notice one team has three players who have experience over level 25 with a few level 9 or 10 sergeants mixed in....and they're be playing against a team of all level 1 and 2 players who are just getting the hang of the game.  These poor new players get their asses handed to them round after round.  Don't you think you'd get sick of it?  Of course you would - and that, in a nutshell, is the reason TI is never going to be a popular game, never going to have a following greater than it currently does, and will never earn it's dev's a dime after all is said and done.  New blood feels the game is rigged against them - which is too close to REAL LIFE, ain't nobody got time for that.  It's an indication of how completely out of touch these devs are with the core market who support the MP/FPS franchise.  They aren't interested in dialog or communication with the communities of modders, map makers, server admins, and clans who make up the backbone of true blockbusters such as Counter Strike and Team Fortress.  That said, I gotta say, I enjoy the hell out of this game.			"

Posted: August 9, 2014
												I recommend this game to everyone, those who likes FPS games, and those...who don't. It's really fun if you want it to be. Can be a casual shooter game or a competitive one depending on how you wanna play it and who you play it with. Some may say it's not fun because it gets too hard for them, or just that they play with guys who are new to it or with those who just wants to fool around. Don't just assume it is not a fun game just after a few hours of playing it. It can take time for you to get used to. And even though T.I. is made by the same guys who made C.S., don't compare the two games. Just take it as a whole different game, or at least that's what I suggest.I like this game a lot. It allows you to get guns permanently, there are achievements that may take you a long time to get, a number of maps and modes to play (after the latest update), driving maps which quite a number of FPSs do not have, and also several skins you can purchase to have a different and a more badass look for your own character. To be honest, I got hooked on this game for months and I still like this game a lot more than other FPSs I have played before. T.I. is also not so much of a 'pay to win' game compared to some of those I have played. Yes it is true you can purchase stronger guns when you are only a level 1 with real cash, but even so, everything can be bought with in game money other than skins. So I personally wouldn't call that pay to win, since you are just buying things to have it faster. It's not like you bought a gun that's only purchaseable with real cash. But well, I respect the opinions of others if they do disagree with me.But of course, there is also the downside of this game.1. Little laggy.There are quite a number of players in this game that face lag. Even though there are players from all over the world, it is still kinda bad. But even so, if you are able to deal with a little lag, it shouldn't affect you that bad. And for those of who you gets really bad lag, like maybe around 20 FPS or lower, if you are using a laptop, try keeping it charged. That's what I do and the lag is gone. May only be for me. I don't know..Ohh. And if you are playing with lag, I suggest you to not play at driving maps that often. Can be chaotic..2. T.I. communityWell, just like in most games, there will be people you will meet who are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. There will be ragers, whiners,  trolls, etc. Just ignore them if you can't take this kinda crap. And if they annoy you over the microphone, just mute them in-game. Good thing they have that option.. If you are able to deal with them, good for you. If you can't, well....try harder..3. HitmarksAfter the latest update in July 2014, the hit registers have been screwed up. It's harder to land hits on target now that the hitmarks aren't as accurate compared to before. Not sure if this applies to all guns, but I notice this problem mainly for the assault rifles. Would appreciate it if this issue gets fixed quick, like say..to how it was before the update on April 2014? Then, the hitmarks were dead on.4. Game developmentSadly, there are only 4-5 developers working on this game at the moment. So, updates can take awhile. But when updates do come, it may not necessarily make the game a 100% better. Like from the latest update in July, it's good they brought in new maps and new game modes. But the hit registers also got messed with. It can take awhile for problems to be fixed and all, but it would be nice if there were more people helping out on the game development. More people to get things done, and more people to get to understand what people actually want to see in T.I and implement them. If things go well with the development of the game, and when more people start playing and supporting this game, the developers would get more income which would keep them motivated. Would be nice for both sides don'tcha think?Well, to sum it up, I recommend Tactical Intervention to gamers out there from all over the world. Yeah, there are problems here and there, but it's still pretty fun. And hey, it's FREE! Would call it a poor man's C.S, but it is better than it sounds, in my opinion at least. It would be nice to have some of you guys to volunteer to help out developing this game too. Also, from what I mentioned about the issues after some updates, don't be too disappointed from what you get as of now. It will be fixed and it will get better....hopefully..			"

												It's about as far as you can get from Counter-Strike's tense and tactical stand-offs (though maybe that's because of the lack of a 5v5 ranked adversarial mode), but Tactical Intervention still manages to offer satisfying and surprisingly fun action, with a unique blend of old-school mechanics and (for lack of better terminology) New Age multiplayer FPS sensibilities, offering the best of both worlds while steering relatively clear of the excesses of other games on the market...... except for its in-game economy, which borders on pay-to-win, and doesn't even seem to be doing the developers any favors, monetarily speaking. The starting weapons are decent, make no mistake, but all other weapons which can only be obtained through the in-game store are notoriously overpowered, and other cosmetic gear items provide similarly unbalanced boosts for a variety of stats (truth be told, they don't really seem to do anything either, which is even worse). You're expected to grind matches to obtain points in order to purchase items on a temporary ownership basis, as permanent gear can cost so many points that you'll likely be tempted to pay up with real money (which is probably the intention here).Still, Tactical Intervention is a game worth trying out, and it does have some value worth offering if you can stick with it. It also has attack dogs, and that makes it worth at least the hard-drive space, in my book.			"

												---THIS GAME IS FUN. 10/10 WOULD PLAY AGAIN---As of July 2014, this game is online-multiplayer ONLY. When you start, you have a stock set of weapons and no equipment. (Personally, I can use these stock weapons and WIN vs good players, just gotta aim!) You start with 50k in GP, enough for a good primary and secondary gun, with money left over. You will need to play or pay to earn GP and buy guns and equipment. Items like combat boots give a slight speed and stamina bonus. Gloves give more melee damage and item use speed. Googles protect from flashbangs... Plenty of other items to earn along the way.What I like about this game...-Simple controls, easy to customize button layout and HUD display-Small/medium sized maps with simple layouts for quick paced action, easy to learn-Several game modes (bombing, deathmatch, VIP escort, hostage rescue, driving, and more)-Teamwork is emphasized: Bonus points for healing team, aim bonus for staying near teammates-Small community of players, very friendly and funWhat I dislike about the game-Small community of players! We need more people playing this game!I know it's not much of a review... but if you have any questions, please add me on steam and ask!			"

												Imagine good old Counter-Strike on steroids...Maybe not polished as CS:GO, but it's free and can give you a decent amount of fun.Not every game needs to be a competitive type.It takes some time, but once you get used to it...Sit back, relax, and drive the VIP to the final destination. Or be a passenger, and help your SWAT team on the way, to protect the VIP... or be on the opposite side, and chase them, shoot them down and don't let them escape...... or just hop into a TDM or FFA if you just want to shoot and respawn quicker when you die.Not much players there, but if you have 3 more friends, it could be very fun playing 2 vs 2, in a private match.Remember, it's free. There are purchasable / rentable things in game (for in-game or real cash), but you can do good with the default guns too, so it's not a big deal... it's not Pay2win.			"

Now you're probably wondering what kind of game this TI really is, huh? Well let me try to explain it briefly: TI is the way the community always wanted it to be, a better and quicker way of playing where experience points is not required to unlock weapons only in-game credits which is given after every match played and that gives every new player a fighting chance. Below you'll find all sorts of information regarding the game, take a look you might find something helpful.[▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲]-=> Tips & Trix <=-Looking for a guide on how to play TI? Then you've come to the right place, just scroll down to the bottom of this page to find the guide. Hope that you find this review helpful and don't forget to press the: |LIKE| button above & spread it to your friends so more people get a chance to experience TI.[ Information! ]A super fast paced first person shooter that offers an intense adrenaline rush when playing ""Vip-Escort"" or ""Team Deathmatch"" whether it's in a car-chase, a strategic mission map or blood a splattering deathmatch, either way you choose to play you'll find TI insanely entertaining, every map offers it's own unique gameplay & strategic design and can be used to your advantage if playing tactically. This game is purely based on teamwork and staying close to your teammates will give you accuracy bonus and the possibility to get healed.[ Modes! ]Rating: (9/10)Bomb Plant, Hostage Rescue VIP-Escort including cars & Of course the classic Team Deathmatch. Feels great to have so many modes to choose from in the same game, it makes for a sweet rotation.[ Content! ] Rating: (9/10)TI offers a nice variety of weapons and equipment for customizing your character in many different ways, alot of new content is added frequently which improves it even further. The recoil system provided in TI is one of the most well balanced in any FPS game ever and it just runs & feels really smooth and it reacts properly. The characters are really well made and the weapon models binds it all together nicely, surely animations can be a bit slack but will be fixed in the future. The damage factor is properly divided depending on body part hit so shooting someone in their legs and feet will require many more bullets than shooting him in the stomach etc.[ Maps! ]Rating: (10/10)The maps surely are top-class and the environments are wonderfully crafted and we can barely wait to see the new maps to come in the near future that will be even better and offer even greater strategic gameplay. They feel really light and natural which adds a great atmosphere to the game and a depth not really found in other Source engine based games such as trees, rocks and rays of light. The textures are also very well made and unique in every map which is nice since it doesn't get so repetative.[ Personal Opinion! ] Rating: (10/10)Highest possible rating because of the potential & depth that TI offers and not what it currently lacks. It feels more alive and unique in it's own way than most games out there today and the future looks bright for TI. All the small details really binds this game together and it makes it feel personal. I used to play Counter-Strike since 1999 to recent times and pretty much all the famous FPS games ever released in between too, sure they we're great in their own way. Yet somehow this game just raised the bar to another level that is unmatched by most games today because it feels much more personal and not like mainstream crap made to suit everyone. TI offers hardcore gaming at it's best!>Absolutely recommended to be enjoyed with friends![▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲|▲]{ STARTER GUIDE! }To begin with you'll start with 10.000 credits and that will cover all the cost of the items to start with if used properly. It is wise that you don't use all of it right away or you'll regret having to use the lesser powerful starting guns when the ones you got expire. And it will only force you to stop playing due to rage. So I'm going to explain to you how to start your TI career properly. Read slowly and try to absorb as much as you can. I suggest you open this guide while in-game for a much quicker & easier access! A few more years and this will become a world famous game not a single doubt about that at all.

												I dont get it why people get all technical when writing reviews ? Half the stuff they write is already on google / wiki. The Kids reading these reviews get brainwashed into judging a game from someone else's perspective instead of experiencing it themselves. Its like hearing from another guy about how he felt when he kissed your crush lolAs far as the game is concerned there is too much going on at the same time in a single round. IT IS ENJOYABLE. IT IS PLAYABLE. But needs support from better servers which lag less, which is hard for the developers as this is a free to play. They really need to fix their ingame buying menu & need to make it more compatible with steam.The game does need a better GPU card if you are thinking about jumping into it straight from Cs1.6 or CsOnline.Apart from that the levels are drawn on the inspiration from Project IGI 2 and are really well designed. I would have enjoyed this game even more if it had a polished open world single player experience. The levels are that beautifully designed.			"

												The game has its ups and downs, but lets be honest, all games do. Yes the animation and graphics can be better, but it's not always about the graphics, its about the community and the gameplay. The game is not pay to win, despite what some people might belive. By the time you hit around level 30, you should have a main assault rifle, a smg, helmets, goggles, gloves, boots, and armor (optional). Even if lets say god forbid somebody buys a gun permanently, then so what? It's a fps game, it still takes skills to aim a gun. The guns are fairly balanced, even more so now that there is a recoil system now, you can't just spray and pray most of the time. I would say give this game a try first, it's free, and you start off with 50k gp which gets u a nice permanent assault riffle right off the bat. If you don't like it then fine, uninstall and move on. If I had read the reviews before I started playing, and if I had listened to them I would have missed out on an awesome game. The developers actually listen to us, they are currently planning a tournament soon it's starting on july 12. So come join us, and have some fun. "

												When Minh-Gooseman-Lee said that he made this game to be ""fun"" , he wasn't lying ..tactical intervention is a crazy fun multiplayer FPS , think CoD meets Counter-Strike and you got yourself Tactical Intervention , fun game modes like your usual TeamDeathMatch and the classic Bomb and Hostages Missions , to driving cars and going through an insanely fun mayhem with your friends down the highway in escort the vip missions ..tactical intervention is a game that has the soul of Counter-Strike , and the body of a fun,fast-based game , so if you have some spare time and you'd like a quick game that is absolutly free to play , where your skills are the winning factor and not your money , give this one a try and who knows .. you might get hooked for longer than you ever thought you would !The game is a F2P game that has in-game currency as well as real money , so you can buy 90% of the things with your earned in-game points and build your own character without paying anything , yes it takes some matches and wins to get more points but in my opinon it's done just right ...  for example , you can buy the best weapon in the game for 1 day with the points you won after doing a mission , or you can save up for a couple of weeks to buy it permenantly , it's always your call and you're never forced to pay anything ..Download size is about 3GBs so it's not really that big , system requirements are also low giving that the game runs on the old source engine , so most machines will have no problem running it , stronger machines will be able to handle the game at highest settings with no real problems and for a 60FPS , the game looks good enough for a F2P game that is made on the Source engine , it's not the best looking game out there but it still is pretty good in some places ..so yeah , give it a try , it's the kind of game that you either love it or hate it .. so try it out yourself and i hope you'll end up having alot of fun in it with your friends and buddies :) !

If you didn't like it before, I'd definitely recommend you give it a second shot. With a small development team and an active community, this game is a lot of fun. New content is being added all the time. Check it out and give the driving maps a go.			"

												This game is in my opinion: highly underrated. I tbh prefer this over cod because of its difficulty, immersion, and unique things you're able to do. Blind fire in an fps is actually awesome. This is just fantastic in my opinion and i recomend (sry for terrible english)			"

												Think of this game like the better graphics and the fast paced move of COD and Counter Strike (i think) put it on a blender and TA DDAAA.... Tactical Intervention, ironicaly its not very tactical. Anyway they are some good things: Free to play, car chase missions (Including on this missions drunk driving and fun), and a bigger amount of weaponry.Bad things: Bigger amount of weaponry doesnt mean that all the guns are good, about 2 or 3 are very good, the others are RUBISH, very weird shooting mechanics and very jerky driving mechanics. So, my conclusion? Its a good game, but it has a lot of bad things.6/10			"

												This was my favorite game for a while until they made every single gun suck. Hi.

Then you found it, when all the ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥who play this and don't ready up, it will make you wonder why you ever got ♥♥♥♥ing a computer. If you play this half the time your screen will be shaking, and the other half you probably have died from some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that buys every single item in the shop just to play one round and♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. When you get this game and ♥♥♥♥ing break your computer moniter, don't be mad, just uninstall the game, and find some other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game that takes up half your computer space that will probably give you a virus.

												What I'm about to give you is a near to honest opinion from a guy who's put about 51 hours into this. Alright, let's start off with the good that this game has to offer.+Car chases.*+Customisation.+Decent map design.... That's about it. Hoooo boy, the negatives. -95% of the community is♥♥♥♥♥♥-PAY TO WIN.-If you want to buy weapons with GP, you will need to grind for two whole days, approximately.-Hardly any updates or nerfs to anything.-That ""breaching""♥♥♥♥♥♥it tells you in the description? None here.-About as tactical as Call of Duty most of the time.-*Car chases are tedious as ♥♥♥♥ - you WILL need a good team or else you are screwed. -*Only thing that will grab you is the fact it has car chases involved.Overall: This game is wasted potential and just fell on it's♥♥♥♥♥ If it wanted to be tactical, it needed to feel tactical and not just be another lack-luster P2W game by slapping a pretentious title on itself. Should you need any ounce of tactical gameplay that's free to play and that requires more thought, just play Ghost Recon: Phantoms or something. Better yet, just ♥♥♥♥ing buy Counter Strike - any one of them will do (except Nexon).			"

												You like this game or hate it, I personally like it. TI does best in it's general gunplay It rewards Fast thinking and teamwork. Some people have said the game is very choppy, I have not experienced this [I have a great vid card] so I wouldn't know. The graphics are not amazing by any means but You can still tell what your looking at, the AS50 is a very overpowered rifle and shouldn't even be in the game,This is made worse by bad TDM spawns, Highway is the best mode in my opinion It was kinda fun driving around Trying to avoid terrorists. With a little bit more work this game could be great. Overall i give it a 7/10 Good to play if you want to play a free tactical shooter and don't care about graphics much.			"

												This game is really easy if you play FPS's. Apparently kids with no arms play this game.But really, this game has alot of potential and can be VERY fun if you play with a team that you can properly work with. It actually gets rather boring if you play against/with pubs because you just end up stomping if you have played an FPS before. I would say 85% of players cause the following gamebreaking issues as this game is all about teamwork, while the 15% are the heros in the match that do everything. PUBS DO NOT- Heal you- Stick together- Communicate- Follow the objective- Kill enemies you would assume would be an easy kill for themPUBS DO- Complain the game sucks because they didn't get a non default gun- Leave matches midway- Stand Still and watch enemies- Crash cars when driving. This game works best if you organize a match with people you know. It gets really fun when you actually start having to use cover properly and work with teamates when fighting intelligent enemies.*Recommend for groups of players, playing alone will only frustrate you*			"

												The game is pretty fun, and it's got unique ideas which I though were executed alright. There are deffinitely bugs in this game, mainly the Highway missions. It's deffinitely leaned to the tactical side, and staying next to teammates raises accuracy which can lead to a bit of teamwork, though not often. There are graphic issues that can occur when set to higher settings, may have just been me. I'd give the game about 7.5/10, so I do recommend trying the game.			"

SUCKSIt's recoil and the screen is just messed up in everyway possible when shooting!I'd rather buy 10 keys in CS:GO and give it to friends than play this because it's just gotten worse and worse.If you want to try it, i can't stop you.... but i can warn you for one of the most crappy gameplays ever if you like the CS series...No offence to the developers, but they really messed it up			"

												The game is pretty fun, and it's got unique ideas which I though were executed alright. There are deffinitely bugs in this game, mainly the Highway missions. It's deffinitely leaned to the tactical side, and staying next to teammates raises accuracy which can lead to a bit of teamwork, though not often. There are graphic issues that can occur when set to higher settings, may have just been me. I'd give the game about 7.5/10, so I do recommend trying the game.			"

												The game is free, giving a default loadout of an SMG, a shotgun, and a carbine. If you can host a game with friends, this game is definitely worth downloading.By owning all the twelve year olds and ragers, playing by yourself isn't that bad either. Tactical shooter that would be slow paced if the enemy didn't always rush your position just in time to get shotgun blasted.It also comes with enough in game currency to purchase a permanent weapon of your choosing. Be it standard AK, exotic SMG or sniper, etc.It's worth mentioning, I also have not seen any pay to win try hards at all.10/10 Would get blown up in hostage room again.			"

												Tactical Intervention is a quite intricate take of things on Counter Strike. Created by a co-creator of CS, I was quite pleased to see the changes they had made to it. With some smarts, and patience, one COULD get really good at it, I thought. To an extent, that may have been true. But I can't help but think the devs were a little too greedy with this game, and a bit unfair in other aspects, as well....First off, the game is a nice take of CS, with great features like rappelling, player VIP escort, drivable cars, breaching charges too! It all seems great, at first. You'll soon find out that rappelling is worse than useless, noob VIPs get themselves killed, thus ending the round, the cars mechanics are absolutely HORRIBLE, and the breaching charges are overpriced. Oh, did I mention that? EVERY perk, attachment, accessory, pretty much anything besides the actual weapons need actual $$$ to use, and most for only a month, as there is no perma unlock for them. I know, crazy, right? But hear me out.The guns themselves are decent, save for one. They can be permanently unlocked, but it is a pain in the @$$ to do when you only have the default guns. What's wrong with the default guns, you ask? They are significantly lower dmg, accuracy, and mag size. Useless. Good thing is, you can rent guns to get ingame money to payoff your rent and even profit, with the right application of use.This needs a seperate paragraph of its own. The Super V. Basically the Vector, it outclasses the M4, AK, G36, every other SMG and assault rifle, destroys shotguns and pistols, and snipers aren't even a challange, unless they have 50 meters on you. Even then, its anyone's guess. Accuracy, damage, RPM, this gun has it all. You can use it in a car, on land, in hell, anywhere. It will ruin the poor fool in front. Devs need to fix this, FAST, or this game could quickly degnerate into people relying on other people's sense of goodwill and benevolence.Honestly though, my take of this game is that it is very good. It has a small community really, so once you meet the right people, (the decent ones with hearts), you will be able to actually play with them, use some strategy, maybe. Strategy in this game, with a closely knit, communicative, strong team will beat almost any opposition out there. Maybe a rehaul in graphics, but that's a minor thing, definitely a change in the whole $$$ grabbing thing, though. Change the way you get the accessories, attachments, aesthetical changes, etc, and maybe TI will get a larger following. That, and a basic autobalance so that it isn't all lvl 40-50s on one team, and like 5 lvl 1-4's on the other. I still reccommend this game, because hey, if you don't give up on it, and you persist, it will quickly grow on you after a while. Then fall off. But let that happen later.			"

												I would recommened this game for the brilliant controls or the amazing mechanics... If it had any. This game is riddled with bugs and poorly optimized. It also has mechanics that are extremly clunky and not modern at all. The model is practically pay to win with the guns being more expensive then the engine it was built from. This game had a lot of ambition and had one or two good names behind it but when you reach for the stars, sometimes you fall and die. I would only suggest it to a blind person because then he cannot tell when I change the game he is playing to Counter Strike or I would suggest it to someone who wants to laugh at the baby of Counter Strike and a hooker it picked up behind the stripclub. Check out the WTF is that TotalBiscuit did and that is how I feel about this game.1 of 69 would totally bang.			"

												Look you'll get into this game and see there are no iron sights, its a bit buggy. But who cares? Its a free game that does what it says on the tin, allows you to drive, shoot and blow stuff up. Most of the bugs are caused by your ping so all of you noobs who complain about bugs i suggest looking at your ping. This game is deffently not pay to win, i have spent a little bit of money on this game yes but otherwise everything else i got was earnt, because you can earn GP to spend on guns. Just play for two weeks and you will be able to afford an smg permanently. So look this game is great for a free game it may not be as polished as battlefield and counter strike, but are you paying anything for it?			"

												I adore this game. It makes my life just turn into a blob of greatness. It has vip gettaways it has rappeling down buildings there are malls to run through while looking for someone to kill. Im just impressed by how its free to play. Its a game you will want. The only problems are maybe 1 or 2 things including crashing every now and then or maybe lag from a bomb. But otherwise the game offers you everything. Guns are realistic meaning its harder to kill someone. You can use a microphone to talk. You can drive cars and poke your head out of the windows. Its just plain amazing. Also its filled with multiplayer things. Im done spoiling. JUST GET IT ALREADY SO WERE ALL HAPPY!			"

												You take the developers of the two best tactical shooter games ever made, you spend eight ♥♥♥♥ing years making the game with more hype than any other game ever released, you add absolutely hilarious and incredible features such as playable dogs and gmod car racing and then you ruin it all within the last few weeks of development by making it pay2win and forcing you to install malware like pando media booster in order to play.South Korea is a cancer on this planet and it would benefit six billion people if north korea bathed it in nuclear fire.

												'Free to play'... Hahaha! Don't make me laugh. I just want to say that the starting weapons are♥♥♥♥♥♥ they are in tier -1 of quality, the kickback kicks you halfway across the map and i once got someone where it said:Hit them 7 times for 14 damageHit you 3 times for 99 damage and guess what, they'd paid for a weapon.

												After over 150 hours of CS:GO this game is possibly the worst way they could've attemted a f2p  clone of sorts. Extremly p2w and so clogged with mechanics that don't make sense that is it embarrasing. You may have fun playing it, but that is short lived when you realized how underpowered you are without any money (which you earn at an extremly slow pace in game.) If you own Counter-Strike don't even bother, and if you don't own Counter-Strike, you are better off buying atleast CS:GO.			"

												This game has a lot of good ideas, and some very cool features. However, I think the free-to-model kills it. Though the developers do give the player enough in-game currrency to buy at least one permanent weapon - choose wisely. Mission game modes are where you want to spend most of your time, if you're into tactical shooters similar to counter-strike. I didn't feel like its TDM mode was the highlight of the show. Actually it kind of feels unnecessary and thrown in for a particular crowd, maybe. Yet everyone seems to play TDM, and that is likely where all new players will start their experience. It is because of that that I don't recommend this game. However, I do recommend one tries the game playing Mission mode exclusively. I will have to play further to determine for myself if all the missions are worth the time, but I am turned off by the free-to-play model - which can be easily exploited for pay-to-win.			"

												Great Game, lots of fun.  It is like a mixture of Counter Strike and Team Fortress.  Things I like:- Gameplay- Missions- Great Multiplayer Fun (especially when you have 4 or more friends and can start your own game)- Items that can be purchased.- Different types of weapons (sniper/close combat/shotgun/etc)What I would like that is missing:- I would like to see more people play the game.- I would like a South African Server so the latency is lower - I would also like to see more ways to earn GP (In-Game currency)- Some items can only be purchased for 7 days, I think everything should have a 1 day option.

												UPDATE 1Many people compare TI to CS, which is understandable, because of the Gooseman’s legacy and that the TI “feels/looks” the closes to CS, but TI is not CS and that is the reason why people like me and all the rest of the dedicated TI players like the game. If I have to describe/compare with a single sentence both of the game I would say “If CS is like a professional boxing with strict rules and limitations, then TI is like MMA (Mixed Martial Arts).” CS is stripped from any kind of “tunings” except the bullet vest/helmet and the defuse kit, which is good for competitive/sport matches (you know what to expect). But in the other hand TI is more arcade, you can tune/create your own “class and style” of game play similar to Team Fortress 2, but without the limitations of predefined classes. You still need some skills to shoot precisely (deal with recoil), use tactics (communicate), use grenades, which I love how they behaves, not like in CS (in CS there are just two useful grenades, flash bang and smoke all the rest are joke), when you throw frag grenade, tear gas, smoke, flash bang you know what to expect and the other side have to get the hell out from there, if they want to survive and even so they still can be blinded for a while after or knocked down from the blast or have a blurred vision, smoke is passive grenade and the incendiary is more or less like the smoke to create a barrier, but not to kill. You can rush/run for your life or to attack, you can peak, you can roll, there is bullet penetration (although not always predictable and sticking guns from the glass walls make greater damage than no sticking, but hey no one is perfect ;)). There is a map and if you make noise (shooting, running or even moving will give your position away) good for ambushing campers. And if you get tired from all that bomb, rescue, escort game play, then you have cars :). There are plenty of weapons, gears and perks to choose from and you start the game with 50000GP enough to buy a decent assault rifle permanent or rent all bunch of stuff. Compared to all that CS is much more limited, plain and simple, which as I said, has its good sides.  TI compared to Call of Duty is still “realistic”, so no any air strikes, missiles etc, maybe just the dogs are that little “too much”, but there is match limitation for them, so it is so so bearable. Although TI is free to play, it is not (at least by my opinion) pay to win game, you can buy absolutely everything in the game with earned game points (GP) just by playing it, the only thing which cannot be bought with GP are the custom skins, which do not have any direct influence on your player specs.If you want to have a look at the rest of that letter and the current issues with tha game here is the link:http://steamcommunity.com/app/51100/discussions/0/46476145348892070/******************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************There are so many good and so many bad things, which can be said about this game and this review, can be really long, but no one will read it, so it is waste of time for me to write it in details. All I will say is:1.	I have bought CS:GO a week before I have installed TI and so far, I have accumulated 125 hours on TI, I am level 23 and I have bought quite few items (already have spend about 260,000GP) and I have accumulated just 6 hours on CS:GO and those are actually, because I have started to play CS:GO now/recently.2.	I am a real world, skill/tactics based, FPS fan and TI had it all and more than any other FPS, I have ever played, but all the romance disappeared after I started to notice some serious unbalance in the game and after a while it is not anymore that much about skills, than just, what gadgets/items you have equipped. From that point on, it will start to become more and more a rat race to gain more GP and buy better armor, shoes, gloves etc, because it will highly influence your success rate, mind you I am not talking about the weapons…. and it begins to feel more like a RPG game than a skill game.  When you win or lose, you know and the rest of the players know (even, if some of them do not admit it), that most of the time you win or lose, because of the better gadgets/items you or they have equipped and the skill factor and the satisfaction of winning are pathetic, if you have to be honest to yourself.3.	I do understand, that the game is F2P and the developers need to make money, but if I buy some DLC, I will become even more overpowered and it will be more like shooting fish in a barrel, than a fair challenge and satisfaction for all the players. I guess that is a common point for most F2P games and the main reason of their decease, which will be really pity for such a great game :(.			"

												Not sure what to write so here's some useless facts about algae:Algae is a one-celled plant that can grow in your pool if conditions are favorableThere are over 20,000 known varieties of algaeAlgae are mainly found in marine or freshwater environmentsAlgae produce oxygen which other aquatic life uses.Algae are important to humans in the form of food and medicine.Algae are vital in many food chains acting as the primary producer of organic matter.In some areas of the Indian ocean the sea surface lights up at night. It is so bright that one can read a newspaper. This light is caused by tiny sea algae, the Dino-flagellata. Sometimes the lightened surface has a diameter of more than 1.5 km.Algae are used in many wastewater treatment facilities, reducing the need for harmful chemicals, and are used in some power plants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.Red algae are important members of coral reefs. Red algae are unusual among the algae because they can include in their cell walls calcium carbonate which makes the plants hard and resistant to wear.Brown algae are found mainly in the tidal zones of temperate to polar seas, but some exist in the deep ocean. Among the brown algae are the largest and most complex of the algae; well-known forms include the giant kelp and the free-floating sargassum weed.Algae have chlorophyll and can manufacture their own food through the process of photosynthesis.Kelps are the largest algaes. They can be more than 200 feet.It is the major food for fishes.The oceans cover about 71% of the Earth’s surface, yet algae produce more than 71% of the Earth’s oxygen; in fact, some scientists believe that algae produce 87% of the world’s oxygen.They also help remove huge amounts of Carbon Dioxide.Oxygen was poisonous to the organisms that populated the early Earth. By producing oxygen, the first algae may have created the greatest toxic waste crisis in history.Fossilized Algae are used to make dynamite.Algae may be able to help save the planet.			"

												I've been playing FPS since Wolfenstein 3D...yes the original.  I'm old.  That said, when I beat FEAR 2 on my CPU while on a ""business trip"" I was looking for an online FPS to fill my time.  I tried CS and a few other Free To Play games.  I even tried TI and decided at first that I didn't care for it.  However, I realized that TI offered the ability to advance through earning levels and GP to purchase better equipment.  I began to play it more and more.  Once I picked up a few guns early on for cash, I improved a bit.  Then a bit more.  Then I earned enough GP in game to buy all the guns permanent.  My advice for new players.  If you like the game, drop $14 or so on it (1/3 of the cost of a game like CoD) and get a solid starter pack.  Then use your GP to buy all the rest of the guns.  Don't forget to outfit yourself with gloves, shoes and other gear to start too (much of which is in starter packs).  It's NOT a pay to win game, but paying a bit up front helps you get a better start.  I love TI.  It's the only game I play regularly any more.  It's a growing entity with so much to offer.  The community is pretty cool.  The developers are very involved.  It's just a ton of fun.			"

												I wouldn't pay much attention to the meta critic score any more or the older bad reviews for this game. Recently got into this game out of curiousity. I was bored and saw the game just sitting there as ""free to play."" So I said ♥♥♥♥ it, why not? I wanted to shoot something, and if it meant a Counter Strike kind of game, why not? I expected the bugs and glitches the game has, and visually a bit rough, because it's a source engine game made by a small group of developers. How ever I wasn't expecting the amount of joy I'd get out of playing this game. Just little things like rappelling down the side of a building to rescue hostages, or using a hostage as a human shield, or having my character followed by a trained attack dog. Though I think the games high light personally is the Car Chase maps. I think if the developers really wanted to change the game around and rake in cash, it would be by focusing on the Car Chase map designs. Barreling down a high way full of traffic, as terrorists and counter-terrorists alike shoot out windows at each other, trying to blow out a tire, or sending a RPG shrieking across the street to nail the VIP car, is by far the most fun I've had in a FPS in a long while. This is not just a positive reviews, but me begging developers to make more vehicular chase maps, by far the best part of the game. For both the action and hillarity.			"

												I only tried this game out as a bit of a joke as I saw a video and the gameplay looked hilarious. It was. I played through this game and I couldn't stop laughing at how legitimately bad it was, it's just not at all up to todays standards. The UI is horrible, the HUD is horrible, the graphics are awful, the gameplay is awful, it's as it was designed by five year-olds and it tries too hard to be something. Sure, it's free but I don't think it's even up to f2p standards to be honest. Oh and it's riddled with Pay2Win.Tl;Dr: I would rather eat a cactus.			"

One of the most fun, interesting, intense and awesomely frustrating games I have ever played. The community is pretty small so far so there are a bunch of really good people to play with but quite a few new players every week or so. For a free game I find it very balanced. The Pay-to-Play features with most free games is practically non-existent. The in game currency is so easy to obtain that anybody can buy anything in the game and be just as good as everyone else. You could spend real money to buy a gun or you can also play 10 games or so and buy it yourself. All real money is good for are buying cool skins, but even then the skins don't add or change the game play. All in all I would give this game a large thumbs up and recommend this game to anybody who wants a free, fun and fair FPS shooter. "

												Can be a very enjoyable game once you look past the dated graphics and dodgy game mechanics. For me my personal gripe is the community itself, it has an obsession with stacking rooms to the point its a complete walk over for the stacked team, for me this poses 2 problems, 1 . its not being very friendly to the new players. 2. even when its you on the stacked side its ♥♥♥♥ing boring to play. I just wish the community would try to balance rooms out more but I wont hold my breath.			"

												Tactical Intervention does look a lot like Counter Strike. Thsi is probably becausae it has been amde by I believe either the same company or developers that helped develop Counter Strike. I own counter strike and plodding through it I have to say I was not impressed. The one kill and you are dead during TDM (Team Death Match) was not fun as I constantly felt like a noob on it.This game is better than Counter Strike. You can drive cars in VIP Escort (CT Mission) Assasinate VIP (Terrorists), you have the basic hostage rescue mission like CS and bomb mission again like CS. You start with 3 choices of weapon, a Scorpion sub machine gun, a boklov shotgun and I believe an M1 rifle. All these weapons feel fairly light when going against enemys with xp paid/ premium paid weapons. Dont be fooled I have won matches where I was only team member against 2 other enemys with nothing but boklov shotgun. Give it a chance.Maps dont look overly pretty but they feel so much fun to blow apart as if you play Office map on TDM or FFA you can blow CPU and filing trays apart to give better view or hide behind. The game feels like you have more startegy. In an escort mission as CT do you zoom ahead and meet the VIP at the drop off point where you are ready to defend or smash terrorist off the road and just generally slow them down, or stick with the VIP car no matter what. Tires can be shot out and if your car gets trashed GTA mother**&&^^ andjust chuck a civilian out GTA style. Dont run them over though that cost you 80 xp points. Kills usually get you 20 unless its  a head shot 1 kill where you get 40 xp.The VIP looks liek an indavidual charchter he looks like a French Gendarme.Maps are varied and you have about 15 ounds 7 as CT and 8 as Terrorists. When you shoot a man at point blank range in the chest with a shitgun...he knows about it as bits of red meat fly over the map. So much fun.In short this feels an interesting look and very indavidual version of a fairly old format cops and robbers. If like me you see Battlefield Hardline but remember Origin wouldnt allow you to play your Battlefield 3 game because it asked for you to sownload plugin endlessly and nothing happened, just take my advice stick with tthis game. You can even buy a dog for 1000 xp if I remember correctly.May be a little more.All in all hillarious, and for the first 9 level you can play with players of the same level if you are like me and want to play European servers but its a day when not many playing go to USA 1 server up to 250 people playing on a good day and I find connection is ok.

Plus you getting much this value from the start of playing and you can buy whatever you need.2.Gameplay.Its like counter-strike with much attention to the details, extinguishers what can be used as smoke grenades, carrying a bomb makes you not so mobile and dangerous for enemy, etc.3.VerdictStill better than Counter-strikes by Gaben, but economics in game makes its look worse in players eyes, yes its bit frustrating, but not something bigger.

												Hmmm, I have an urge to bash this game and say it is a blatent ripoff off of Counter Strike. But in all honesty, that doesn't do the game any justice. It has the same features as Counter Strike but how you play and what you do will greatly affect your experience. First of all, Graphically, it uses the Source engine so the graphics are decent but defineatly not great. On my machine at max settings, textures have the same resolution as a Minecraft block. Furthermore, the animations are stiff and unrealistic. However, just like in Counter Strike shooting is good. You have 3 default weapons which are all good and balanced well and even the shotgun doesn't seem overpowered. The maps are fairly large with open space and little nooks and crannies. Most maps are designed for 6v6 gameplay although some maps are big enough to hold 24 players. There are the standard TDM but there is an interesting gamemode called Highway. As the name suggests you drive a car and shoot people in other cars and retrive the intel. Nothing in this game is unique but it is not supposed to. It is simply a F2P Counter Strike. However with all the problems the game has I would rather buy a $20 game like Counter Stike because it would provide a  better experience. Oh, did I mention the screen shake? But to be fair, you get enjoyement when you play this game, which is why my final veredict for this game is a 7/10			"

												This is a simple first person shooter that looks like Counter Strike Global Offensive on steroids, except that this game was actually made by one of the leading developers of Counter Strike before he quit, got drunk, and slept in a box on the sidewalk. But enough about him. Let's get right into the review.Straight foward, this is a fun game. It's absolutely ridiculous in some ways, but I mean it in a good way. You have highway maps where you can drive in a high speed chase down a busy city. It has a big veriety: Small maps or big maps, small guns or big guns, small objectives or big objectives, and small cars or big cars. And blood goes everywhere. Really. If you're under 18, and I'm not even kidding, this is as bad as the Killing Floor.Sadly, since this is a freetoplay game, that also means it's buy to win. But it's easy to get money, you just have to complete missions.Really, I love this game, and I play it often. I hope you download this, but don't take my word for it. Take the advice from the hobo hiding in a box on the side of the street that made this game in the first place. :)			"

												How to know when a game is bad - when you don't know what is happening. This game is so chaotic, and unplayable. The shop is impossible to understand, and anything related to to this game. Shooting a pistol hurts me instead of killing the enemy by making my head hurt with it's unusual pattern of the jerked up recoil. This game should be in alpha after all the bugs and broken features of this game. Just another poor excuse of free2play. 2/10			"

												Its hard to review a game like this. as theres alot of people trying to compare it to other games.Yes it is SIMILAR to counterstrike but it has a totally different feel to it.Firstly The Gunplay:The gunplay like CS does take some skill to get used to but you cant just spray willy nilly like CS if u know the spraypattern. TI requires precision aiming and burst firing that are different for every gun that makes them distinct. I personally like the feel of how the gunplay is handled and it feels very right with the other aspects of the game.next up the Movement.this is the part i love the most. In TI they have Dodgerolls to put out fire & making it harder to get hit. Stamina Cooldown. Leaning Left & Right for Peaking & a over head peaking. basically you have many aspects of being able to do things to evade & shoot that makes this very Tactical and helps the flow of the game.on the whole its a game where ull need to sit a few hours to get a real feel for it but its a great game if you take it as it is.be warned that you might get stomped as it has a skillcurve but thats just how it is. but if you put in 5 or 10 hours ull likely get the flow of it and it just keeps getting better from there.the items are fairly price and u start with a decent amount of ingame currency to buy a gun straightup if you want but its best to test them out nowadays to see if you like them.TLDR:Great game why arnt u trying it out already its F2P.if you got any questions just ask me.Teufel outtt			"

												Like a good sequel should, Tactical Intervention doesn’t ignore the formula of fast, fluid gameplay that has made the series famous, but introduces a unique new premise, unprecedented player personalization, and sweeping changes that breathe new life into the multiplayer experience. It’s over-the-top and at times unnecessarily complex, but serves both current and next-generation consoles with ambitious new ideas and tremendous replay value.			"

												This is the single most greatest game ever made. Skyrim needs to take notes. The gameplay is 11/10 and the graphics are astounding. This game is optimized for every PC, and has the greatest driving mechanics I've ever seen in a game. I feel like GTAV took the driving mechanics from this game. And better yet, it has a first person view. As a terrorist if you leave the area you'll get sniped, this further enhances the gameplay expierence by destroying the feelinf of exploration by trapping you in an enclosed area. This alone makes the game feel very alive.This game has no pay-to-win features and have completely balanced weaponry, with the exception of a few (evenly balanced) DLCs.Great game.			"

It does take a little while to get used to the mechanics but the most important thing you need to play this game is common sense and a little bit of awareness. Teamwork will get you far. As for the pay to win mentioned beforehand, the devolopers are only monetizing thier product, It is pay to stop being an inpatient git.			"

It is really Addicting as long as you have someone to play it with, its Easy creating lobbys and the game functions well in terms of Gameplay i have a couple of thoughts about the game Pros: You can Zipline,have pets, Get Riotshields, and There is a good variety of weapons.There is a LVL systemYou can obtain coins wich you spend on Gear in the game.The Animations are HilariousThe Civilian Voices are done by the Devs and are really funnyCons: The Game might seem a bit Pay to WinThere are alot of Bugs (Wich ofc. will be fixed)You cant Zipline with your Dog #SWATDOG.Controls are a bit Confusing from time to timeYou lose Exp for killing Civilians, Even if your on Terrorists.

												The does always impress me, from the beta, to now. I would rather play this than Counter Stike, no jokes... You go the legend creator of Counter Strike on this ship. This game is every unique, if you have a optimal graphics card, and not an intergrated one, than you experience changes. I got to play this game on my pc, with the update graphics card, man, it was a big difference, performance wise. I actually won the damn match, because of that. This is the most anticpaticated game of all time, from the trailers, to back when it was going to get released. Give them a break, for ♥♥♥♥ing sakes, its a f2p first person shooter, the guns in this game, don't define the person playing, it still takes skill to get someone.

												UPDATE: JIM ITS DEAD.. The games dead dont even bother downloading this. Only EU servers left and the admins dont give a fk anymore. After they changed (Now to FixGames, who apperently dont fix a♥♥♥♥♥♥.) it just got worse and worse. I got atleast 10 pictures of different ingame bugs and glitches. Ignore what is down below this. Its just dead.This game is.. a mixture of emotions. It is a pretty good game, i enjoy it when i game with friends and buddies. The mechanics are almost alright. The guns handle pretty... unique, though difficult for newbies and ameteurs alike (and im sure even some pro's will agree the handling is pretty difficult when compared to other games.) There is a shop that lets you buy things with In Game Points (GP), but most of the greatly customized things (permanent attachment guns are pretty rare and limited edition) and skins and playermodels are all bought with $$$. An offer that allows you to buy said customization would be great, also the option to buy attachments permanently rather than a 2 week rent would be great as well!The major complaints are the community. Its just as bad as CoD most of the time. High lvls are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s most of the time, especially since most of THESE people cheat to achieve such levels. The game lacks VAC, which makes hackers stick to this game like flies on honey. Not only do these ""High"" levels disorient new players to automatically delete this game (i could point out this could be considered cyberbullying believe it or not), but they also ruin the fun for other gamers who try play this game fairly. The voting system... well it sucks. It is completely broken and makes even kicking an obvious hacker a hassle since most of the time the voting screen wont pop up. All these, in addition to slow action from admins and well.. the lack of them (never seen an admin in my game time to be honest). The game quickly went from having over 600 players! 600 was plenty, always rooms to join, and places to come to and play. Poeple would join pretty quick (600 might seem insignificant, but in this game, where ya need a minimum of 4 players to start a match and max was 20, it was plenty. and im talking of the USA1 server alone). Now... barely 150 when the game is at its peak, and 100 barely most of the time, play this game usually. and the other servers are empty, so im talking literally 100 players playing all servers (USA1 is the only server used). Out of these 100 players, a vast mayority are hackers (im including aimboters to the term just for this review.) I have heard a lil rumor VAC will finally be enabled in a week or two.. but is it too late for this nifty F2P FPS game? or will it attract gamers back to this once wonderful game? Only the Developers will be able to save this game.Edit:I have seen cheats and have reported atleast 6 or 7 people. Not to mention the massive aimbot community.  The community is horrible a lot. (have images to prove that one actually) and well, there is some hope. VAC is coming to TI very soon (bout a week maybe i heard), but is it too late? The community ranges about an average of 110 players online at any time (pretty low considering the 600-700 players when i began at earlier stages). The guides are ok, but still not very helpful considering the weapons depend on your playing style (everyone has their own style). Also the ""pride"" high lvls have.. well kinda aholes if ya ask me. i seen unfairly balanced matches, all lv 1-5 in one team, and another team with lv 30-40 (several high lvls) just putting down new players making them hate this game to the guts. (an option to chose which lvls can join would be great).Always voting down when a vote for balance teams shows up (i also need mention, the game voting system is cmpletely broke. i have yet to see one day where it works).The need for 4 players min is horrible too. if i want to play with a friend, i cant since i need 4 players. making private 1-1 battles impossible. Also there is the vehicles and the lag these cause (barely anyone can drive those things without crashing. the vehicle engine (ragdoll effects and how it interacts and stuff) is pretty bad as well. my Car can drive over cars like a tank. the streest are really narrow, the stages feel cramped (try Office with 20 people for a size) and monaco is barely playable. its not all that bad, now attachments are rentable (next step, permanents), and the skins are more diverse (paytowin spoiler too), though impossible for normal players to get due to the $$$ cost rather than GP. Weapons (except snipers and shotguns) are a tad more balanced. (snipers are either OP or very crappy (like the initial sniper everyone gets.. i can get quicker kills with the initial pistol than with that sniper. and the AS50, the most OP gun in the world, especially for people with really low PING and FPS. *cough* or aimbots. Shotguns are all broken, the bullets dont spray much (especially on the autoshotgun) making it deadly and just ridiculously op to the point of making half a team quit and the other half quit due to being outnumbered (seen it). As mentioned earlier, bots would be a great addition, allowing players to practice alone at the cost of 0 GP (or maybe a GP reduction depending on the ammount of players on like.. maybe player kills count and bots dont or something) or to fill up stages (many cases of making a match when all are full and nobody joining). some more mechanics like this would be great. The recoil is still as high as ever, but i guess that is what makes the game somewhat (since there aint ironsights or anything). The game is ""alright"" but until there are more players and the VAC is set up, i would NOT reccomend this game myself. Kudos and hope someday TI will carry forward, right? Anyways.. thats more my line of thinking. The dev's aint to blame either, i think they done a great job with each update (really seen lots of improvement). Just hope the community gets looked over.UPDATE: JIM ITS DEAD.. The games dead dont even bother downloading this. Only EU servers left and the admins dont give a fk anymore. After they changed (Now to FixGames, who apperently dont fix a♥♥♥♥♥♥.) it just got worse and worse. I got atleast 10 pictures of different ingame bugs and glitches.

												Bit too laggy and still a little bit glitchy, wouldn't recommend this to people who expects furnished features like Counter Strike. I expect more from the future and this game have potential to be as good as Counter Strike if the developer gives more time to develope more content in the future. The game is great! Choose from TDM to Missions that require teamwork! I like it a lot but would be better if the prices were lower for everything or increase the game points you earn from matches.

												Hmmm, I have an urge to bash this game and say it is a blatent ripoff off of Counter Strike. But in all honesty, that doesn't do the game any justice. It has the same features as Counter Strike but how you play and what you do will greatly affect your experience. First of all, Graphically, it uses the Source engine so the graphics are decent but defineatly not great. On my machine at max settings, textures have the same resolution as a Minecraft block. Furthermore, the animations are stiff and unrealistic. However, just like in Counter Strike shooting is good. You have 3 default weapons which are all good and balanced well and even the shotgun doesn't seem overpowered. The maps are fairly large with open space and little nooks and crannies. Most maps are designed for 6v6 gameplay although some maps are big enough to hold 24 players. There are the standard TDM but there is an interesting gamemode called Highway. As the name suggests you drive a car and shoot people in other cars and retrive the intel. Nothing in this game is unique but it is not supposed to. It is simply a F2P Counter Strike. However with all the problems the game has I would rather buy a $20 game like Counter Stike because it would provide a  better experience. Oh, did I mention the screen shake? But to be fair, you get enjoyement when you play this game, which is why my final veredict for this game is a 7/10			"

Probably the reason why not many people play this game is because of the trailer. In the trailer they totally messed up on the music and everything, but if you just give this game a chance, I guarentee you'll enjoy it. If you're Asian and you live in an Asian family like me with Asian anti-video game parents like me, then this game is for you.

												I honestly have NO idea why people are hating on this game. Possibly because it's a ripoff of csgo, but I see that as a good thing. Probably the reason why not many people play this game is because of the trailer. In the trailer they totally messed up on the music and everything, but if you just give this game a chance, I guarentee you'll enjoy it. If you're Asian and you live in an Asian family like me with Asian anti-video game parents like me, then this game is for you. Or at least if you can't get csgo. 9/11 George Bush approves ex dee lol u wot m9 install now very gud			"

The amount of recoil on a rifle is ridiculous to the point where you literally cannot aim,  you have to guess where your bullets are going. I agree with a lot of the metacritic views. just seems unfinished and doesn't look as good as you think. There is a lot of Pay to Win. Don't play.			"

												Tactical Intervention is a mix of Call Of Duty, Battlefield and Counter-strike. It combines all the mechanics of these games to give a very nice experience. When you get a lot of gamepoints you can get weapons (Or just buy them with real money). So that's the BIG minus, because it's FREE TO PLAY!!			"

												This game is amazing just like counter strike it is hip fire and really well done. The problem is with this game is the lack of game modes but as patches for a new UI and modes with new maps (without DLC) this makes for a great free to play experince. Yet I'm a little mad at the devopers that they made better guns but having to pay with real money but it's okay because the guns are banlced. Other problems are that ingame money is hard to get but this also makes the guns less op yet it's still fustrating because the guns are just so good. But after all the problems with this game it's amazing and free so download it and be happy you did. (P.S. Careful Mac users your game will crash during loading maps due to the new update.)			"

												As i looked through the reviews before  i downloaded this game on my pc, i was a little turned off at the comments said about this game, but when i played all my doubts disappeard. Its true that this game does not have the best graphics, or the best engine in genral, but i think thats not a fair way to judge any game, what matters is the gameplay, and the concept. this game has a very simler feel to counter strike 1.6, but with a little more added features like the lean or the role, but ignore those details because those are things you need to try for yourself to understand weather you like it or not. The main issue that people have with this game is the pay for guns, where in order to buy guns you either play for a long time just to bearly make enough for one gun, or spend real money which is around a doller or two, but when you first start out you are givin enough points to buy any gun of your choosing, and you can afford just about anyone you prefer. I know the pay for guns is usually an issue for people, but remember this game is free, and the creators have to have a way to make money, and i think a doller for a gun you can own permenantly is a fair amount. This game has multiple modes: my favorite  is the vip escort which is where you have to escort a vip in a car and you get chased by terroists, you have team deathmatch, hostage rescue, and demolition. The other issue that people have is the small communtiy, yes it is very small, but enough for you to join a lobby, and play a full game with enough people, and the best part is the community in this game are pretty nice. over all i think that you should download this game, and give it a shot sense its free, and you can uninstall it anytime, but when you play, dont play with the mentalty of thinking your going to be the god of war, and then rage everytime someone kills you, but instead play with the intention to have fun, and laugh everytime you get a kill or get killed because i guarantee you'll see this game the same way i do.

I mostly play the car mission, those always make me laugh and are great fun. The other normal misisons i like are airport and highrise, other than that idk. I mean it is glitch and seems a bit werid, bu toverall fun. Btw work for a gun you want and buy it permantly, then you can work to buy other things permanntly or for a limited time, i know it sucks, but once you have a permant gun you want, then it seem as tough.

												Currently, I'm rank 16, and I've killed exactly 8712 other players, and have died 7622 times. I've won 196 matches, and have lost only 154 in comparison. The game in itself is strenuously challenging, but not impossible. I'm tempted to say that it's difficult to cope with at times, and is not for everyone. You need to be able to react fast, and build a common strategy as to how you'll get your next kill in. Spawn points are ridiculous, but it often favors random parties. Same goes to individuals, too. There's people who like to complain a lot by the way, about choice weapons, such as shotguns or the often spotted P90. It's mostly fun, though, to watch them ramble on and on about that last headshot you got in on them. All in all, noobs will be owned, but you can still easily work your way up with experience, and of course, the GP you earn with every match helps tremendously. Just be sure not to stray away from the shop. One can easily earn the necessary armor and weapons for more comfortable gameplay, or just flat out buy it with cold, hard cash, for not everything can be purchased with GP. At the same time, it doesn't take forever to save up GP either. As far as developing one's inventory goes, to each their own. One shouldn’t complain about another’s fix.			"

One can easily earn the necessary armor and weapons for more comfortable gameplay, or just flat out buy it with cold, hard cash, for not everything can be purchased with GP. At the same time, it doesn't take forever to save up GP either. As far as developing one's inventory goes, to each their own. One shouldn’t complain about another’s fix.			"

												This game is a giant parody of every ""serious"" FPS on the marketIt takes its art style from CounterStrike, adds the paid DLC that borders on ridiculous from CoD,and uses a few metric tons of nonsense from Battlefield Hardline.Almost everyone who didn't recommend this game either expected something similar to one ofthe annual Treyarch games or is merely trolling.If you demand being able to 360noscope, rek scrubs, or are just a gigantic tryhard in general, look elsewhere.If you want a game you can hop in and play with your friends at 2 in the morning and laugh at the insanity,this game is for you.It's like the party game of the FPS genre. 8/10			"

												I hope this review is seen by T.I,This game has a wealth of potential, its Highway mode map is very fun and I am not going to lie, I have laughed my♥♥♥♥♥♥off at the randomness of it and the physics.. I am actually laughing now because it is so .. over the top.But there are moments when you are driving, pursuit, leaning out of the car window and feeling so damn cool.. But then it all goes to hell quickly.Things I would like to see improve are:1. Ingame menu. This could use a complete visual update, it looks like it has not been developed.2. Animations. The animations are quite cooky. A lot of jumping around, hopping about and while I appreciate that enemies should animate to represent low health.. I would like to see the pantomine jumping/hopping redesigned... It is cringeworthy.3. Physics and speed. The game feels very raw, especially when leaving a car or crashing etc.. The speed of it all is way too unpolished and could use some more realism overall.4. Textures, the guns are nice. (The fantasy knife is silly though). But if the car dashboards could be made to look nicer this sort of stuff would improve the game inmeasurably.. There are a lot of pointy edges on textures which is really wrong in a game made in the 2010's and onwards.. If the textures and models could get better updates to look much better then this would rocket with users.Basically the cringe worthiness would be reduced .. I say start with the ingame menu and spectator like stuff because that would be easiest? quickest and most effective as the current score card system looks like it was left to rot in a basement and forgotten about.Will download this and play again as I want to support this project, it has so much potential.. CS and Cars is EPIC and FEELS EPIC... Time to polish the chassis now and tune up the suspension I think lads!Catharsis			"

												I have only played this game for 17 hours(currently as of writing this), but I can say that it feels like a lot more! Tactical Intervention is a Free-To-Play game running off of the Source engine, the same engine that runs Counter-Strike, Team-Fortress, and other multiplayer Valve games. When playing Tactical Intervention, you can tell that the game's developers were inspired by Counter-Strike. You will however run into small bugs and glitches while playing, but Tactical Intervention is still receiving updates. I recommend this game because it is fun to play and it still gives off a nice, overhauled Counter-Strike feel!			"

												In my opinion, Tactical Intervention is a very good and detailed game. It offers you to challenge the terrorists while being the police and the same about being a terrorist. From a variety of gamemodes and missions, you can choose to protect areas, people and things to trying to get as many kills as possible in a TDM Match. All of this is offered for free with no sort of in game payments. Ofcourse, you can skip a few hours of trying to unlock a weapon by simply paying £2.The overall system of the game is very good. Obviously, because this is an older game, the graphics aren't great. The game ""hawken"" surely can't be beaten in graphics by any game. Even a game as good as this.The buttons are fairly easy to get used to with the default keys to move as ""W,A,S,D"" and the mouse to ""aim"" and ""fire."" In my opinion, after a year of playing Minecraft, i changed the shift key to the crouch button because its my natrual idea for crouching and my natural movement od my hand when attempting to crouch. To roll out of an enemys line of site press ""x."" The roll key is very useful when trying to get out of any line of site but also is annoying when you jump of a 1ft tall wall and you automatically roll into an enemys sniper bullet.Being a huge Call Of Duty fan, i am used to ""annoying"" snipers and trickshotters, slowly swarming over the Call Of Duty franchise. The only game that wasn't as bad was ""World Of War."" In this game, snipers can take up to 4 bullets to kill. Exactly like ""BattleField 2-3."" I like this aspect because its real war and it matters how good you are; not how lucky you are.Overall, this game is very good. I give it an 8/10. If the graphics were improved in a newer version, im sure this could be a competition for some well-know franchises.- Mason Firman | CEO Of Many Websites.			"

												Not bad game... some different style is in this game compare to other similar games.Just like defence the VIP car... like that and one amazing thing is also exist.The Korea map is in this game which is my country O_o나쁘지 않은 게임입니다. 그리고 좀 색다른 스타일도 있어요. 예를 들면 VIP 자동차 보호하기 같은거랄까요. 놀라운것은 한국맵이 있습니다 무려... ㄷㄷ 외국게임인데 일본 중국도 아니고 한국맵이 있네요... 한번쯤 해보시길 한국분이시라면 ㅋㅋㅋ 또 FPS 게임 좋아하시면 말이죠.

												Many people may say this game sucks, or that they play it for the ""lol's"", and I really don't see what they mean. It might not have the best graphics, and some things need to be balanced, but overall this has been an awesome and very fun game. My favorite gamemode is ""VIP Car Escort"" which is present on 3 maps (Play Monaco, Innercity or Highway on Mission), but is sometimes boring when you get in a car with a sucky driver. It's a fun game that requires some thinking.			"

												While this game wasn't a big hit, it has a certain charm to it that has kept me coming back. A friend recommended it to me and I was skeptical at first, but after playing a while I found I really enjoyed it. I also found out that a lot of what people say about it is wrong. First, it is not pay to win, and the grinds for guns are hardly long at all, compared to other online games.Secondly, I realize that it is fairly cheaply made, but for free? You can hardly beat that. The only things that cost money only are skins, which do nothing. I have not spent a cent on this game, and yet I am just about to purchase the most expensive weapon.Thirdly, the gamemodes are fun, especially the vip escort missions, which usually end up looking wacky and hilarious. Their is a moderate team element to this game as well, so that is always nice to know.Lastly, I was looking for a simple mmofps that wasn't pay to win and consistently fun, this was it.The only downside to this game is that it is filled with children who spam the mic and complain, but you can always mute them, and airheads who think they are immortals among men. However, these problems typically pollute every online game. Overall, it is a fun, free experience, and I intend on playing it for a long time, try it before you judge!			"

												In my opinion, Tactical Intervention is a very good and detailed game. It offers you to challenge the terrorists while being the police and the same about being a terrorist. From a variety of gamemodes and missions, you can choose to protect areas, people and things to trying to get as many kills as possible in a TDM Match. All of this is offered for free with no sort of in game payments. Ofcourse, you can skip a few hours of trying to unlock a weapon by simply paying £2.The overall system of the game is very good. Obviously, because this is an older game, the graphics aren't great. The game ""hawken"" surely can't be beaten in graphics by any game. Even a game as good as this.The buttons are fairly easy to get used to with the default keys to move as ""W,A,S,D"" and the mouse to ""aim"" and ""fire."" In my opinion, after a year of playing Minecraft, i changed the shift key to the crouch button because its my natrual idea for crouching and my natural movement od my hand when attempting to crouch. To roll out of an enemys line of site press ""x."" The roll key is very useful when trying to get out of any line of site but also is annoying when you jump of a 1ft tall wall and you automatically roll into an enemys sniper bullet.Being a huge Call Of Duty fan, i am used to ""annoying"" snipers and trickshotters, slowly swarming over the Call Of Duty franchise. The only game that wasn't as bad was ""World Of War."" In this game, snipers can take up to 4 bullets to kill. Exactly like ""BattleField 2-3."" I like this aspect because its real war and it matters how good you are; not how lucky you are.Overall, this game is very good. I give it an 8/10. If the graphics were improved in a newer version, im sure this could be a competition for some well-know franchises.- Mason Firman | CEO Of Many Websites.			"

												I have played alot of first person shooters, when I say one is bad, Idk if it can get worse then this. It is not Tactical, rather a arcade shooter. I do like it though. It may be a poor mimick of counter strike, but it is a free one. The  graphics are good. The weapon buying system is okay. Its more like COD then Counter Strike, but a arcade shooter is fun. Yes, I do recomend this game, but it is not everything it seems. Over all, 8 bullet holes out of 10.			"

												     It's really fun, though there are a lot of things that they need to fix. Let me show you the reasons of, ""I like this"" and ""They need to fix this.""I like this:1. It's really fun once you know the controls2. VIP Escort.3. Awesome firstperson view4. The DLC, you don't have to buy it. There are GPs (Game points) that you can get for playing.5. Dogs. (Sadly, Husky's only in the DLC ;-; Why...)They need to fix this:1. VOICE ACTING.2. In VIP Escort, as a passenger,  Very buggy when someone's driving3. Models and Graphics could be better, they look like they're from CS:S4. Who makes a trailer that looks like it's awesome?     So, it's fun (What I think.). Think about it, besides, your not wasting any money by buying this. Hope this was helpful!			"

												i just tried hard to like this game.. but it had nothing tactical and certainly nothing to do with cs. i was thrown in some kind of shooter game, where everyone seems to be your enemy and friendly fire even gives you some extra points.. just shoot at all and everything that moves. can't see anything tactical about this. and not very satisfactory to me, like there won't be a yes, we are a good team and that's why we won this round. why are there teams at all to start with? maybe i just got to the bad servers over and over, but everywhere i joined a game, it was like that. just because it's free doesn't mean it hasn't to make sense.. deleted from harddisk.. will certainly drop by again in future, maybe the name of the game will swap over into actual gameplay. however i prefer to stick to cs for now. and yes why not, payday.. those games actually let me feel that i'm playing a real tactical game. as said, i don't condemn this game, maybe it will become better, but for now it's even worse than team fortress (which i actually had paid for before it became free), at least there you have teams and also get that sense of running around like mad funny chickens shooting at all your enemies. still you've got a team and you can win, what actually gives you a sense of acomplishing something.

												this game is simultaneously bad and goodits a free to play lobby based korean counter-strike clone (pretty much CS:GO except with a 1.6 feel)good because of its simplicity and rewarding gameplay; you shoot a guy, you get a pleasant THUD sound of it hitting their body, and people generally die when you get the drop on them. its a game that rewards fps experience, instead of trying to pull the rug out on you. this is also a source engine game so the engine physics should be familiar to anyone who has played counter-strike. bad also because of its simplicity, because really, it looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ the animations are silly as ♥♥♥♥, the interface is amateurish, the whole thing seems janky and held together with duct tape--- but it works. it's just not that polished AAA visual experience that all modern shooters strive to be these days. also the playerbase kindof sucks. being a free to play game its plagued with underexperienced and underaged kids and you often find yourself on a team full of them. also you only get to pick from 3 guns at the start. everything else you have to purchase with ingame earned points or cash money. (which really isnt a problem since ttk is low enough nothing really feels unfair)i have fun playing this stupid game because its a fun stupid game. why dont i just play counter-strike? i dunno, im kindof burned on counterstrike and you cant HOLD YOUR GUN IN THE AIR ABOVE YOUR HEAD like you can in this game. that feature aloneALSO YOU CAN DRIVE CARS AROUND PWSSH CRASH BOOM BAMtldr play this ♥♥♥♥ing game i dont care if you think it looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥its better and more fun than planetside 2			"

												This was my re indoctrination to pc after I went to consoles in 2004. And man I am glad it was the game to bring me and my shiny new pc. So your a console noob I hear you yell. My answer, was. So what gives me the right to tell you about this being a good game and definitely worth your time? Well the 440 hours as of current, the fact I learned how the hell I am supposed to use all my fingers but my thumbs, a polar opposite to a controller which is both thumbs n two fingers. And finally the fun and laughter I have shared with this great games awesome community. Now I'll be honest my view on this game is bias because if you spend 440 hours in something of course you defend the reason. So yes I have on my rose tinted glasses. But I will be honest about the game to the best of my ability. So I got my new PC and spent way too much on it. So now I look at the game distribution platforms and I know steam to be the biggest and most well know. Downloaded. Next what can I afford on steam? Shakes out pockets... damn no money. Ah a free to play tab, now we are talking. Scrolls through a small list... hm Tactical Intervention. Downloads. Installs. Boots up. Play button. Server browser,  EU 120 players excellent.  Now I sit in a lobby presented with two options. Mission or TDM. Well I wasn't a fan of call of dutys TDM so ill go mission sounds interesting.  Whats WASD? Fk me my♥♥♥♥♥was handed to me so many times by some germans who were high rank with damn good guns. But I get the odd kill and have a good laugh and my shizness at keyboard, failing to hit keys, missing shift and control. Over the next month of November I practise and learn and well I also found driving maps. BEST TIME I EVER HAD! Seriously if you get this game just for the driving its good. Any way as December came I was a adept keyboard user. I could control everything confidently and I had reacged out from driving to bombing and hostage rescue. I was noob no more being on posotive k/d s and man skyrise is fun rapelling with my hard earned p90 I got from driving. TI was good. A few months down the road EU 1 was a barren wasteland and at 11pm GMT it was a ghost town. So I reached out to the 250 in USA to get my drinvg fix and around feburary I had run across some TI regulars by the names of Waxychicken and greengo. Im level 20 at this point with 120 hours on record still doubtful of my skill on a keyboard and let slone gameplay. However they had the lobby down to four on four. And they suggested a scrim with me against them with the 3 I didn't know. I thought we were doomed.  However to my surprise through hard work learning keyboard controls and through are somehow coheasive team we manage a draw. Suddenly I feel at equals to some of the best players on the game.Throughout the next year of 2014 we met up at around 1am gmt and play mission modes, meeting the wider ti community from the expanse to gamer junkies, ger-ti, aq to name a few clans out there with me still popping in to the now 90 EU1 when available. Now this is what made TI great. It always provided fair fun and amusement to me. And so here is my intro for PCNow here is why I recommend it:1. Free to play, and easy to get you started on pc games in the future2.good mechanics and a solid game3.is updated and still with developer support which would be omega and cohort. 4. The community is active and very friendly5.plenty to choose from. Now 5 modes with corrosponding map variety. 6. Doesn't require a pc as expensive as mine to run7.  Most importantly it damn good fun!Now of recent its run into the odd issue like only EU/RUS servers and the performance issues for weaker pcs im told. Obviously not everything can feel balanced, the graphics aren't that of a AAA title (I think it gives it a unique charm tbh) the voice acting is weak for some voice packs but great for some, please jump off a building and laugh at that screaming asthey fall its just 10/10. Unlike the im dying and certain hostage talk. Though there statements are funny.Any way try it its free. The only thing you stand to loose is shizzle loads of time. Comfortability as you laugh so hard it hurts, maybe the odd £ $ ¥ € ₩ etc if you buy a skin pack to look badass and maybe your dignity as you crash into every damb lampost as we yell at you for being a bad driver while taking a terrorist car to the♥♥♥♥♥:D			"

												This game falls into that mystery relm for me where I would much rather pay and get a full deal game than get a free experience with missing parts, then end up paying more in the long run to get these parts. This feels more like a pay to win game due to how much real life money I have to pay to get a single weapon that is signifigantly better as a whole for a short period of time. Thats right kiddies you pay real money for a temporary item. Also, game play isnt that bad but the system for weapon collections is ridiculous.			"

												It's got potential, but I'm not seeing it at all right now. It's a ""Pay to Win"" kind of f2p game. I come from a TF2 and Dota 2 background where you don't need to spend any money at all to be good at the game. The fact that I have to pay tons of games to earn game points, only to realize that I can only have that gun for a week just sucks. Everything costs so much, and requires dedication to play this kind of game, All mannerisms of customization is cool, but when those customations actually alter gameplay aside from the guns bothers me. A guy who's really good at the game gets rewarded, whereas other players who aren't the best get punished by low gamepoints, leading in no helmets, guns, kevlar vests, or even a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dog. I'm still torn on this game. It's kind of fun, but I'm still not seeing it as the next Counter-Strike.			"

No, but really, this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ It has crappy control, it's pay-to-win, and it has very outdated graphics for when it was released. It's however very hilarious when in a lobby with friends.

												This game is the typical generic FPS we all love and hate at the same time. Some maps are nicely done, but the weapon recoil is really unpredictable and hard to control, so gameplay can become frustrating. You can roll in any direction to evade shots, explosives, etc, but it feels really weird and sloppy. The default weapons aren't balanced at all, they are very bad, like usual with F2P games. The good thing is that you can buy permanent weapons with in-game currency, but assuming you don't play 6 hours a day, it can take a long time to get enough money to buy a single weapon.The only interesting thing are the driving maps, but again, they are not well executed. The driving is cool at first, but it gets annoying fast, because car controls and physics are awful. The rescue missions are fun and the rappel and dog mechanics are nice additions, though. There are ""kill streaks"" too in the form of special grenades. It's always fun to burn multiple people at once with an incendiary grenade you just got magically. XDI would only recommend this if you don't own Counter Strike yet, because it's a superior game in every way.			"

There is no tutorial or some♥♥♥♥♥♥that explains you what is happening, you just jump into the middle of a game, and you can't even figure out what really is the mission, you get shot by a random dude in the first 10 seconds of the match. It didn't really make me to want more of it.			"

												I cant say its Amazing game.. And I cant say its Bad or wrost game I ever played.Its good war game bettween tourrists and FBI-Police. Chooce a side you want to play If the FBI you need to protcet clivines-hostages and to prenvet that tourrits will put thier bomb on some where place.And if you the tourrists you need to put the bomb.Its like on counter strike but I mostly like more counter stike then that.Its have a good multi- you can play whit your firends. but its have alot of cons that I hope they will fix.So I recommned you to play on that game if you want to take a part and play this shooting- war game between 2 groups.Annnd do not forget to HAVE FUN MATE!

												This game is so unique but all goes that,its too old.Cause this game might be my favorite F2P games,but instead of most of items was Pay 2 Win mechanics.Its overused.The game Mechanics are kinda a bit serviceable,gameplay looks Counter-Strike :)But Team-Deathmatch looks less fun than Counter-Strike offered.There`s 1 Mode where you protect the VIP while Driving to the Checkpoint,and its demand the replayability of the game.And.........Thats it.Lol.The Bugs,as you can tell,its way too many,network connections are more than 300+ ping,no asia players played this game,really shamed :/The weirdest part of bug is when you died when chasing/Protect the VIP,you will be follow the Camera of ""Anything"",No Border,Every Civilians,Every Cars,Helicopters (Best Bug is when helicopter hits the building,its start Glitching up,like something that Helicopter feared to get crashed but not crashed xDGraphics,well i can tell it was ""Portal 2"" Source Game Engine Version,but its really dated,its not worth maxed about.Thats all i can said.In my final opinion,this game doesn`t seem worth to download,but i enjoy only Chasing VIP or stuff like that,others are forgettable and buggy.And don`t remind me this as Counter-Strike because its complete opposite.Rating - 5.0/10			"

This game is alot like Counter-Strike. No, forget that. It IS Counter-Strike! This game is so much like it, I could remove that CS game from my wishlist. This game was $0.00. However, the game on my wishlist (CS:GO) is $19.99. IT'S THE SAME GAME, so I would rather this game and this is why:StoryGameplay: 8-10This game has a built-in radar system that detects moving enemies. It also has a cool feature to highlight who your friends are (yellow) and just ordinary players (green). The mechanics of the game run fairly smoothly on the lowest res and graphics and also the rolling mechanic is a dream if you want to relocate efficiantly and quickly and as a followup, you can lean and blindfire. Which blindfiring can get you killed more easily and I never use it. A flaw of this game is it's squeakers. And squealers. This is multiplayer and this flaw falls under gameplay because you get killed when squeakers rage on the mic. And♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if squealers rage on the mic.  Graphics: 9-10It COULD be a little better due to the source-like graphics content. But it is a great look. This game allows you to immerse yourself into the tactical methods to take out your enemy. I have every thing punched and wound down in the settings though because I'll lag otherwise. But I'll take your word for it in the comments if any graphics are suitable. I will change the rating accordingly. Controls: 9-10I would give it this score except for one flaw: The talk key is bound by default to... gawsh can't even THINK about it... ""k""! OH MY GOD! WHO WOULD REACH THEIR HAND WAY THE **** ACROSS THE KEYBOARD TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR FRIENDS?! I have no clue WHY I am *****ing about this because you can change it. Also, I recommend that you bind Primary to c, Secondary to V, Rolling to X, and knife to Z. This way, you don't have to reach the # keys. And you know which one's which. There's also a range of stuff up in the gameplay stuff too that are controls worthy but I won't explain them. Sound: 10-10It sounds like an actual warfare/counter-terrorism act. This will also help immerse yourself into this. The weapons sound fairly... worn in sound to put it mildly (that's badish). The rolling sounds awesome though. And, when you hit someone, it makes a gibblet bursting sound (if you don't know what ""gibblet"" is, look it up). It's really nasty. Replay Value Overall Rating Value: 9.595-10This game is a cool game and is JUST LIKE CS. So I would reccomend this to my friends and to anyone who reads this if you are the one to take up the Tactical action (no pun intended). Also, Bewary of the squeaker that thinks he's the best at TI. I have him linked in my group in trollable people. So just have fun.			"

												As a game that was created by ""Gooseman"", one of the co-creators of Counter-Strike, you'd think a mind like his would spawn something as fun and challenging as said game... Well, you'd be wrong.The game in its current state, with the old F2P cliche of being handed the worst guns in the game and a not-at-all outstanding gameplay despite the creative and often-tactical features (such as rappelling or using an attack dog), is absolute garbage. I'd recommend staying away from the game unless you're thinking of forking out some money to skip the rage-inducing starters. Money that'd be better spent on something else.			"

												It's very mediocre at best.-Hit detection is shoddy.Your chance to hit someone is pretty rare unless you are in melee range, and even then it is a crapshoot whether or not your 30 round clip will register a single solitary hit against your enemy.-Damage you do seems to be completely random.From what I've seen, the difference in how much damage you do per shot fluctuates randomly, you can fire at an enemy from a certain distance and kill them in a couple shots the first time around with headshots, and the next time you see them you can hit them an upwards of 5-9 times from the same HP to actually kill them as opposed to the 2 needed before, there is no consistency (Tested with standing targets at the same distance with the same health, and the same weapon with similar latency between players)-Paying to unlock items way beyond your level that can still be used against new players.Not going to say Pay to Win nescessarily, however it is a definite advantage over anyone using the lowest tier or starter weapons with absolutely no accuracy or damage output Vs. Mid to high tier weaponry (Provided the RNG damage is more likely in their favor)-Level designs are all over the place.Not to say they are horrible, just that they are a little too asymetrical. One side almost always has a clear advantage in terms of manuvering, cover and objective placement.-Highway modeIt's a fun gimmick, but ultimately with the rest of the mechanics of the game the driving novelty wears off once people have to start shooting again.Most I could rate it on a numerical scale would be 4/10It isn't Obscenely horrible, but it was a decent idea executed poorly.

												Ok, so I have 7 hours on record on this game, but I should only have 30 mins of it. The reason was that my friend kept on asking and pestering me to download and play this game! I had fun on some matches but most of the time, i hated the game. Why you ask?  -menus are hard to use -Gameplays werid (I switched from Call of Duty (and games like COD) to CSGo and I came 3rd on the leader board. On this game, I quit)-The driving is terrible-the rent system is good, but it still costs too much, yet alone perming a weapon-Graphics suck. Worse that CSS in the modern day-sights are 1,. hard to use and 2. you cannot perm sights.-Rounds are way to long-Not even good for starter gamers.Now, I know that the game is still in beta (I think, I havent played this game for a long time) so things may have changed but this game in my opinion sucks. Try it for your self! You may like the gameolay but you will be stuck in the starting menu for ages before getting into a game. The procedure is too long for this review so just Google search or go on youtube to find it.

												The Desert.  Lost.  A familiar shape glimmers at the horizon.  Cactus?  Mirage?  A daunting march toward answers.  If real you could go blind slaking your thirst on its sap; you could die.  You might die before you reach it.  Will you die with dignity?  Desperation.  You approach the cactus and see that it is formed of old feces and the spines used needles.  A small clearing surrounds a slit on its trunk: a sap hole?  You grip carefully around the stained hypodermic barbs and, regretfully, push your tongue gingerly inside.  Something unusual--should this taste metallic?  As you recoil to inspect the area you notice the slit has relaxed; opened wider, you spot a glimmer inside and pull disquisitively at the opening.  Red and amber circles overlap above a narrow metal opening.  ""Please insert card to purchase one squirt of sap.""  And now... the choice.			"

												When you first look at this game, it looks very promising. But when you download the entire thing? It's filled with Pay to Win! And for a game on Source, it's poorly optimized. Just get Counter-Strike. You'll have more fun there. (Best part about this game: The uninstall works :D)			"

												Everyone has an opinion and interests in different games/genres but in spite of that, I have to give this game a definite thumbs down. Without some ridiculously large updating for basically every aspect of the game, I cannot reccommend this game to anyone....ever....period. I will hit on a few points that I think apply to any gamer regardless of preferences in game genres.GRAPHICS- Absolutely ""so-so"". Nothing beautiful or fancy here, regardless of the rig you might be equipped with.GAMEPLAY- Fairly confusing (especially to newcomers), annoying controls...not at all user friendly-even with a gamepad. STORYLINE- What storyline?CUSTOMIZATION- Mediocre at best, and thats only if you wanna pay for in-game items (IMO: seriously overpriced).UPDATES- I see that the developers have recently done some maintenance, after quite a bit of time. Regardles of what changes were mad, I don't believe there is any saving this game. OVERALL-It just doesn't have anything really good going for it to counteract all of the ""bad"" surrounding it. It would take a serious change for me to ever recommend or even play this game again. The bugginess and overwhelming amount of problems will keep me far far away from this title probably until it is put in it's well-deserved grave IMO. I would encourage you to make your own opinion, especially as this is a Free-To-Play game.			"

												The game is ment to be another Counter-Strike game and does furfil that promise, but nothing else.Games are laggy and teleportation often even when people have pings lower than 120 which is acceptable. The driving mode is unplayable. Cars pop in and out of view crashing into anything and everything. The other game modes cater to the high ping players making them bullet proof. The GP rate is much lower than it was in beta making buying perm weapons impossible, from 1000 GP to 150 GP that gap is massive.The game is also horribly optimized. At low settings i hardly scrape together 45 fps. I do play Mechwarrior Online, Left 4 Dead 2, Warframe, Combat Arms at decent settings and keeping above 50 fps with my budget video card. STEER CLEAR of this game until they fix it. Or better yet just get play a diffrent tactical game, this game is far from tactical.			"

												This game, though new, and basically a more modern take on counter strike (not surprising as the creator also work on CS), is  a good shooter. With two kinds of game modes, mission, which basically follows the same kinds of missions in CS, and a TDM mode that can sometimes make for good pick up gameplay & crazy fire-fights. Fighting focuses more on using cover and has leaning in it. Guns (aside from default ones) must be bought with Game points though, which is a downside. These and experiance points for the ranking system are gotten through gameplay, so the game is better for those who are dedicated gamer. Still is a great game, and is free, so I would  recomend a try out.			"

												Tactical Intervention is basically a free version of Counter Strike. But not as great, which is to be expected. This game is fully centered around multiplayer with several maps from cities to construction sites. This game also features abilities like hijacking a car, scaling down buildings, and my favourite, using innocent people as meat shields. There are many weapons throughout the game, most of which are unlockable through in-game currency. The thing is you can pay 1500 for a p90 for a day, or you could pay 35000 and get it permanately. Money is not hard to get, so 35000 is not some large impossible number to get to. I would definitely recommend this game for people who want a free CS-like game.			"

												I honestly wanted my review to be positive. after the new update i just can't. In short, this game used to be awosome. It wasn't new players freadnly, but that was part of the fun in the game. crazy respown system that has it own laws. team death match or objective play. It was a far beter vertion of cs. you had more untilites and it didn't focus on skins. even the starter guns are preaty powerfull. however i wrote that it used to be. after the new update i just lost all hope on the developers. YES it is a free to play game. but the isues the game have such as unbalnced wepens (after the new update, they made the shotgun not only powerfull but with beter accracy. ""Yay""), remake of good maps that ruins part of the fun (ofice was edit 3 times!!! 3 times a big edidt. now it is far more ""tactical"" or in other words alow newbies to survive without understanding they need to take cover), one of the funnyests objects with cars is more lagy them ever (been like this for a while), the ""Balance system"" is working ""as goos as ever"". sure they add game options to make it more reasltic, and they upgrated the grafic, but seen my avatar dies by lag in good garthics or by shotgun becouse a noob was lukky to spawn bhind me isn't what i ask for. if you wan't to argue with me DON""T MAKE ME START TALKING ABOUT THE ASSO (thats for players that play the game). so if you intersted in the game, forget it. until you will get the tactics for the map perfectly and practice with your fav wepen, you will end up learning it all over agean... p.sWHY YOY NEREFED MELE? IT WAS FINE, IT WAS, THERE WERE MATCHES JUST OF MELE IN THE PAST AND YOU KILED IT!it is beter to relode and shot if you are out of ammo them to use a knith.. or mele.... i might played 425, and i can say i enjoyed most of it, but now it just ruind all the good memories.

												This game, though new, and basically a more modern take on counter strike (not surprising as the creator also work on CS), is  a good shooter. With two kinds of game modes, mission, which basically follows the same kinds of missions in CS, and a TDM mode that can sometimes make for good pick up gameplay & crazy fire-fights. Fighting focuses more on using cover and has leaning in it. Guns (aside from default ones) must be bought with Game points though, which is a downside. These and experiance points for the ranking system are gotten through gameplay, so the game is better for those who are dedicated gamer. Still is a great game, and is free, so I would  recomend a try out.			"

												This game is amazing.Unlike most other Free 2 Play games with a shop system, you can actually be good at the game WITHOUT having a full wallet. You get 50k GP for starting out (the game's currency) which you can spend on guns, and equipment. The only item you have to buy with real money are character skins, which are useless and don't do anything, so it's optional.Unlike most FPS games where you can just run around and shoot, here you can run around and shoot, but loyal to the game's title, it is Tactical. You can roll (though it makes anyone dizzy) by pressing X, lean around corners by pressing Q or E, or press both to enter blind fire mode.Also, it's an FPS that supports teamwork. How? Being near your squad (you can pick either Alpha or Bravo, doesn't do much difference besides the fact that you get the following bonuses:) increases your accuracy, compared to if you're a lone wolf, and you can heal... other teamates. You can't heal yourself, which supports teamwork, as you'll need to be near teamates in order to stay alive.The game is pretty gory, which is nice, however, if you're a big baby who cries everytime they see pixelated blood in a video game, you can turn it off.Also, you can pick up fire extinguishers and blind enemies with them. 10/10 would play again			"

												I actually enjoyed this game to some extent. Putting aside it's near enough pay-to-win aspect, horrible texture qualities, bad weapon handling etc, it does provide you with using hostages for cover, rappelling into buildings, driving at high speeds to fire upon other vehicles and other cool things. Sure enough, there are other games which have this and most likely better made than this BUT you can play this for free - kinda. With a little work and less of the need to have to pay for your equipment, this game could actually be great. But for now, we shall stick with this.			"

												Everyone has an opinion and interests in different games/genres but in spite of that, I have to give this game a definite thumbs down. Without some ridiculously large updating for basically every aspect of the game, I cannot reccommend this game to anyone....ever....period. I will hit on a few points that I think apply to any gamer regardless of preferences in game genres.GRAPHICS- Absolutely ""so-so"". Nothing beautiful or fancy here, regardless of the rig you might be equipped with.GAMEPLAY- Fairly confusing (especially to newcomers), annoying controls...not at all user friendly-even with a gamepad. STORYLINE- What storyline?CUSTOMIZATION- Mediocre at best, and thats only if you wanna pay for in-game items (IMO: seriously overpriced).UPDATES- I see that the developers have recently done some maintenance, after quite a bit of time. Regardles of what changes were mad, I don't believe there is any saving this game. OVERALL-It just doesn't have anything really good going for it to counteract all of the ""bad"" surrounding it. It would take a serious change for me to ever recommend or even play this game again. The bugginess and overwhelming amount of problems will keep me far far away from this title probably until it is put in it's well-deserved grave IMO. I would encourage you to make your own opinion, especially as this is a Free-To-Play game.			"

												I believe T.I. is essentially good a Counter Stike rip-off, however i think most people who play this, myself included, accept that it is such and continue to have fun with it because we're a bunch of stingy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who have trouble taking the padlocks off our wallets.  That said, T.I. does incorporate some interesting features that C.S. does not have such as (correct me if i'm wrong) driving and everything having to do with driving gamemodes, rappelling, leaning around corners, and lets not forget the ability to ""do a barrel roll"" to name some.  One more criticism is that the in game currency takes ages to earn (its slightly pay to win).  I've played for many an hour and only managed to rack up enough moolah to purchase an smg.  To be fair, weapons can be rented for cheaper.  Also, recoil is a bit high, but i've grown to like it.  I would rather fire a weapon in a video game with realistic recoil than one that has been dampened to almost none *cough cough C.o.D*.  In all, I think T.I. does have its downfalls, but it includes enough new and interesting aspects of gameplay to make it a worthwhile, fun way to waste time and keep in mind, its pricetag is $0.00.

												This game is amazing.Unlike most other Free 2 Play games with a shop system, you can actually be good at the game WITHOUT having a full wallet. You get 50k GP for starting out (the game's currency) which you can spend on guns, and equipment. The only item you have to buy with real money are character skins, which are useless and don't do anything, so it's optional.Unlike most FPS games where you can just run around and shoot, here you can run around and shoot, but loyal to the game's title, it is Tactical. You can roll (though it makes anyone dizzy) by pressing X, lean around corners by pressing Q or E, or press both to enter blind fire mode.Also, it's an FPS that supports teamwork. How? Being near your squad (you can pick either Alpha or Bravo, doesn't do much difference besides the fact that you get the following bonuses:) increases your accuracy, compared to if you're a lone wolf, and you can heal... other teamates. You can't heal yourself, which supports teamwork, as you'll need to be near teamates in order to stay alive.The game is pretty gory, which is nice, however, if you're a big baby who cries everytime they see pixelated blood in a video game, you can turn it off.Also, you can pick up fire extinguishers and blind enemies with them. 10/10 would play again			"

BAD CONTROL ON CARS , WEAPONS ETC.2. CAN BECOME LAGGY SOMETIMES . I HAVE A 2 MB INTERNET ( LESS BUT ... STILL ) AND  MY PING IS SOMETIMES 1000+MS.3. ITS BASICALLY CS, JUST WORSE . 4. HARD TO LVL UP.

												Free to Play, Asian style. That's how you sum this game up.Do not get it mixed up with ""Pay 2 Win"", if you work hard and save, you get to sit back and enjoy. Don't buy the silly temp rentals. Save, and buy perm weapons and items. Boots, holsters, ""pets"", skins, weapons... All of them can change the game play.Maps are tactical, charging in doesn't work all the time. Knowing how other people play, that's what makes you win.If I had to hand out ""best free military fps"", that would be TI. Nothing comes close for military FPSes. Being on Steam is a big bonus. No launchers or other junk!7/10			"

												I've played the game for a couple of hours. I started it because I heard it was made by a previous dev of Counter-Strike. It's not quite the same as CS which isn't necessary because it has some innovating features. (Like a fire extinguisher which is actually useable.) In fact the game isn't all that bad but it's really not that well optimized. There are a lot of glitches. I still want to give it a thumbs up for creativity. It really didn't deserve the 47 metascore. It could easily get 55+ as some people like the game. Don't listen to the people in the customer review section, go check out the game yourself! Then decide wether you like it or not. ~Mr			"

												Whacky♥♥♥♥♥game that runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥but the gameplay is good and is fun. Here are some suggestions,bugs - 1) Plese add Asia servers in the beta. I lag like hell currently in the game. 2) In the beta, after 15-20 minutes my laptop HEATS UP SEVERLY and shuts down on its own which could end up ruining computers. 3)You guys REALLY need to decrease and improve the recoil of ALL the guns. Every time I shoot a gun I feel like I am some kind of a terminator who has gone full retard and on steroids. I can't shoot at a thing properly withou shooting something else. So PLEASE decrease the recoil. It is the only problem in the gameplay :/4)When I set the resolution to any other number, I can't see the votes in-game and the text is very small that is hard to see. I will give it a  7/10 Would act as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terminator again...			"

												Tactical Intervention is refreshingly different from most team based FPSs out there. It has a strong emphasis on team play and can be very rewarding when working together with friends and others. The veteran FPS players will find many familiar aspects with new, unique twists. While offering many game modes that each offer unique experiences, my favorite at the moment is the VIP car escort missions. For me, driving in TI with friends can be as satisfying as playing pocket Medic in TF2 with some friends. There is a great sense of comradery and enjoyment that surpasses the competitive aspect of it and really shows what these types of games are about.I encourage all that appreciate team cooperation and coordination to give this game a go, you are bound to find players that share the same passion, and if you are looking for such players hit me up to give it a go :D			"

												Pretty fun game. It's somewhat Pay2Win seeing as how it takes forever to earn in-game currency and seems like there's those few people who spend $20-30 just to get some of the most powerful weapons in the game. But aside from that, all guns and most equipment can be purchased with the in-game currency. The game is pretty unique in how there's leaning, rolling and a radar based on sound made in a radius around your character. The game is also rewards you for sticking with your team as it gives you better accuracy/stability when near teammates. Also not the mention the Highway level which is a car chase. (Kinda hard to explain it, But it's really fun.) I would recommend giving this game a try, it can be hard at first but once you get the hang of the controls and get used to using lean and rolling, it can be a very fun game.			"

												I was planning on writing a long, drawn-out review for this game. Instead I'll just give the TL;DR version.Pros: There are definitely guns. Uninstall may just work.Cons: Clunky aiming. Clunky movement, and useless sprint. Weapons have absolutely no weight or feel to them. Default weapons are awful. The gore is used horribly. Animations are stiff. Sound-design is sketchy. Sometimes locks you out of certain graphics options. NO FOV SLIDER (Seriously) No Dubstep during combat. No bikini-clad women running around the maps with dragon-painted AK's. Cannot turn off bloom/HDR/other lighting devices. I have not seen a single Gooseman yet. Actually made me use humor in a review. Ew. You have to buy helmets for operators (who should--presumably--have them standard issue). No. US. Servers. Bland design. Guns feel like they should all have ADS, but they shoot like they shouldn't.

												So, here is the successor to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive from the developers of the CS series themselves. In short, I don't think so and here's why:- the quality of the game feels a bit underwhelming like it was given a low budget to work with ranging from animation, sound, voice acting, and graphics (don't really mind the graphics that much)- controls feel a little bit clunky, but I usually get used to games with clunky controls for some random reason (unless it's at the point where the game is considered to be unplayable)- in addition to clunky controls, the recoil of the guns are pretty strong to the point where it gives me a headache when I hold down the trigger of an assault rifleSo, those are the main reasons why it feels like a Half-Life 2 mod to me, but here is why I think the game is still fun regardless of how bad it is:- the stupidity: what I mean is that on how bad it feels, especially the voices coming out of their mouths is pretty funny for me if not annoying for most people- the VIP Escort mode: arguably the best game mode in the game because of how ridiculous the driving is- they did add in a couple of mechanics like leaning and combat rolling for your pleasure, even though I forget it exists for some odd reason All I can say now is that this game is not the true successor to CS: GO, but it's still fun regardless of the negativity people say.

Posted: August 1, 2014
												This game is very intriguing to me.  It starts you off against other players. Sometimes those players are very good, you will curse 50 times or more in the same match and you will call people hackers.  I've been there.  The intriguing part about this game, I think, is the rank system.  It is a very good measure of your skill, assuming you arn't a veteran with a new account. My point for bringing that up is if you play for the first time and you don't like it but you don't have the patience to learn the game and gradually get better then this game is definitely not for you.So instead of telling you all the great things the game has to offer, let me give a couple tippers that has helped me along. Finding the right gun for you is very important. I went the easy route at first and just looked for the most expensive items, then I got a little more interested in weapons with better stability, because those guns arn't going to bounce around quite so much when you shoot them. Crouching improves aim, shoot in sperts- particularly when aiming far away, and be mindful of your cross hairs. They will help indicate how accurate you are going to be (Without the scope attachments). Another big thing I find incredibly helpful: Play with earphones, keep your area as quiet as you can, and listen for the things your radar does not pick up. One more: Sneaking helps a ton; obvious, I know.  Run when you need to get from point A to B quickly, but when you know or even just suspect that someone might be around the corner, sneaking helps.  You might be able to throw them off your trail and get the jump on them first. It won't always work, but it will help you considerably in staying alive and even get you a little oomph in your accuracy.So this game has a lot of potential, and they are still adding stuff to it.  We got a new beta map and a couple new beta game modes just a week or two ago from this review. Most of the community is pretty cool too, and I will look forward to seeing you play.  = )Hope to see you there. "

												First of all, if I wanted to play a game like this that not only has the same everything (minus the fire extingusher, dogs, ect.), but actually runs on my Vista at more than 10 fps, I'LL JUST THROW IN THE $19.99 FOR CS:SOURCE! Hell, I could buy CS:GO for $14.99....Pretty much what this is is a F2P, P2W CS:GO made to look pretty. Same weapons, models, even still goes by the Source physics engine. Plus, you could either pay the 14 dollars up front for CS:GO or pay the same amount just on weapons so you don't die every 5 seconds from people who have put $100+ into the game.In other words, don't waste your time. Go play one of the CS games. They're better.			"

												Pretty fun game. It's somewhat Pay2Win seeing as how it takes forever to earn in-game currency and seems like there's those few people who spend $20-30 just to get some of the most powerful weapons in the game. But aside from that, all guns and most equipment can be purchased with the in-game currency. The game is pretty unique in how there's leaning, rolling and a radar based on sound made in a radius around your character. The game is also rewards you for sticking with your team as it gives you better accuracy/stability when near teammates. Also not the mention the Highway level which is a car chase. (Kinda hard to explain it, But it's really fun.) I would recommend giving this game a try, it can be hard at first but once you get the hang of the controls and get used to using lean and rolling, it can be a very fun game.			"

												I MEAN WHILE IT HAS SOME HIGH POINTSthink of this title as a free to play call of duty, not even 5 seconds into the match and the other team was already ontop of our spawn, the weapons are used on a timed basis after purchase. for example after you save up all this meny for the best gun you can only use it for 48 hours after you purcahse or keep it via microtransactions. wwhile this game provides some fun if you get over the call of duty-esque style you can have some decent fun overall 5/10			"

												this game is amazing, have you ever played call of dinky or battlefilled? can you roll in those games? i dont think so. you can roll in tactical intervention. it also has the name of the #1 sniper in cod history. coincidence? i think not. think of it this way, this game is a mixture of call of duty and battlefield. thats two games in this review we're talking about 3 games 3-2 is 1. there is one eye in the all seeing eye of the illominatery. 3 games = 3 sides. 3 sides=triangle. triangle = the way our faces are made (eyes make triangle with middle of mouth). faces = there are many in the game. game faces = america football. america football = lesser rugby. rugby is originated in ugly teeth land aka great britain. great britain = part of europe. europe = communism. communism = vladimir putin. vladimir putin = illominatery.this game is illominatery cunfirmed			"

												Tactical Intervention is refreshingly different from most team based FPSs out there. It has a strong emphasis on team play and can be very rewarding when working together with friends and others. The veteran FPS players will find many familiar aspects with new, unique twists. While offering many game modes that each offer unique experiences, my favorite at the moment is the VIP car escort missions. For me, driving in TI with friends can be as satisfying as playing pocket Medic in TF2 with some friends. There is a great sense of comradery and enjoyment that surpasses the competitive aspect of it and really shows what these types of games are about.I encourage all that appreciate team cooperation and coordination to give this game a go, you are bound to find players that share the same passion, and if you are looking for such players hit me up to give it a go :D			"

												Whacky♥♥♥♥♥game that runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥but the gameplay is good and is fun. Here are some suggestions,bugs - 1) Plese add Asia servers in the beta. I lag like hell currently in the game. 2) In the beta, after 15-20 minutes my laptop HEATS UP SEVERLY and shuts down on its own which could end up ruining computers. 3)You guys REALLY need to decrease and improve the recoil of ALL the guns. Every time I shoot a gun I feel like I am some kind of a terminator who has gone full retard and on steroids. I can't shoot at a thing properly withou shooting something else. So PLEASE decrease the recoil. It is the only problem in the gameplay :/4)When I set the resolution to any other number, I can't see the votes in-game and the text is very small that is hard to see. I will give it a  7/10 Would act as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terminator again...			"

												Whacky♥♥♥♥♥game that runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥but the gameplay is good and is fun. Here are some suggestions,bugs - 1) Plese add Asia servers in the beta. I lag like hell currently in the game. 2) In the beta, after 15-20 minutes my laptop HEATS UP SEVERLY and shuts down on its own which could end up ruining computers. 3)You guys REALLY need to decrease and improve the recoil of ALL the guns. Every time I shoot a gun I feel like I am some kind of a terminator who has gone full retard and on steroids. I can't shoot at a thing properly withou shooting something else. So PLEASE decrease the recoil. It is the only problem in the gameplay :/4)When I set the resolution to any other number, I can't see the votes in-game and the text is very small that is hard to see. I will give it a  7/10 Would act as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terminator again...			"

Along with the fact that you don't get to do much before a high level wins and you sit on cam for the next 9 hours as the guy that got you is now having a ring-a-round-the-rosey party with your final team-mate.But as far as ive seen everybody is taking this game as a joke.

												If you like wasting your time and paying $86 for a handgun that lasts two weeks, then yeah sure get this game! But if you're sane and don't enjoy paying for EVERYTHING in a game then don't get it! There is no reason at all why you should even consider this game! This game is a pain to new players and is almost unplayable! There is no balance at all! Crap/10Get this game if your bank account is inifinite. "

												I sexually identify as the FitnessGram Pacer Test. Ever since I was a kid I dreamed of being an multi stage aerobic capacity test that progressively get more difficult as it continues. People tell me that a person can´t be a school fitness test but I don´t care, I´m beautiful. Every morning I wake up and tell myself ""The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds"". My running speed starts slowly but gets faster every minute. In school, every time I hear the bell I think ""A single lap should've been completed, and if It isn't completed twice the test is over"". From now on I want you guys to call me Fitness Gram and respect my right to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. If you can't accept that I am a aerobic capacity test then you're a testophobe and you need to check your running privelage. Thank you for being so understanding.			"

												I started playing it about two months ago and so far I have had more fun than any other shooter recently. It feels solid and I like the driving missions and being able to use my dog in certain levels as well. I went ahead and purchased all the DLC because I believe in the game and want to support and I like the custom accessories. All $76.39 well spent. I would recommand the game to anyone and I have been telling the members in our gaming community about Tactical Intervention. The only thing I wish would change(and has nothing to do with the product you put out) is the competition is most mostly a joke. I'm not talking about being average gaming joke. What I'm refering to are people who don't even know how to play video games it seems. I notice players asking how to get out of vehicles and some that don't even know what the WASD keys are for. If you want to have a good time with friends and enjoy Counter Strike style games than this is a title you can be prould to add to your library. The few times I do get some competition the game shines.			"

												A poorly executed game that claims to be ""Counter-Strike's Superior"" but nooooooo, this game has several flaws in it and here are the reasons why I hate this game:Pay To Win (P2W): Are you %!@$ing serious!? This feature has gone too far to the game itself, I don't want to waste my money over a gun that can kill almost anything but not a guy who have a LOT of stuff. It should just use the traditional $ to buy weapons via Buy Menu like in the Counter-Strike series...OP Shotguns: Am i playing CoD right now? AM I!? okay, here is the point, Ive seen a dude almost get a K/D ratio of 67/39 using a shotty itself, which is ridiculous. And for the fact that the pumping animation is SLOWER than any FPSes I've ever played, it took me about a second to fully pump a shotgun before returning fire.Laughable Animations: Heh, the player animations in this game are so laughable, they run like crabs with guns, the reloading animations are okay though, just the running and crouching animations are just meh, but this is just my least problem about the game.Characters look ugly as hell: ???, why is everyone look outdated and just retextured? Can't they just make a single character without looking like.... ripped off from a old game? Again my least problem from these reasons.Gameplay itself: Worse than idiots running around with shotguns in the game itself.Spawns: Oh hell no, TDM got the spawns similar to CoD's spawns... take this as an example: 2 Guys spawned, then a enemy spawns right behind them and he mowed them down using its OP Shotty or a powerful weapon...Weapons that obscure 50% of your screen: ""Oh look, my gun is so big, I can't see♥♥♥♥♥♥on my screen, I'M DEAD!"" Seriously, they just make the guns hideously giant to obscure your screen just to admire what your gun looks like, they should just make it smaller and less obscuring-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------And the only thing I like about this game was the:Gore: Hey, despite I don't like this game, they made the gore look satisfying. Instead the character's head stays there when it gets headshotted by a powerful weapon, it bursts into tiny pieces with blood all over.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pros and ConsPros:  Captain Obvious much? Better than CoD          Good Maps          Gore Simulator with CTs and TsCons: Again, Captain Obvious. P2W          Bad TDM Spawns          Ugly looking characters          Animations that are the most laughable than any game.Overall Score: 15/100			"

												I have a more honest review than others have provided. This is not the poorest game I have ever played. I am also very sure....well wait a second. I have Goat Simulator. It is exciting and demanding and stressful like TI. I guess considering I have played Barbie Live while playing Goat Simulator maybe it is the poorest...well wait a second...I also have Grow Flowers Simulator and you know how difficult that can be. So considering my strong miltiary experience and game ownership...TI may well qualify as the worst. I guess the individual cost we all experience to obtain TI should reveal the overall value.

												From the moment I played this game I felt like ripping my hands off and shoving them into a blender to then sell to African stalls as a cool refreshment because I know theyre into that stuff. I also bit my feet off to feed to the local homeless community as they would like my feet. The pay to win aspect is like paying your sister to take pictures of yourself in the shower while you cry about the game and shampoo your pubes into oblivion. My condolences to the families of the creators of this game as im now coming to rip their heads off hide theyre bodies in a trash bag then let my friend Pakalo Papito feed them to his 654 pound daughter Juanita Sanchez Albright.

												Reminds me a lot of those tactical mutators for unreal tournament 99 and it plays like one too.Graphics: Would have looked dated in 2004, doesnt look like a source game or take advantage of the engine.Audio: Meh, didnt leave much of an impression but wasnt noticeably bad either.Gameplay: Some of the gimmicks (human shields and vehicles) are interesting but poorly implemented, There is nothing particularly ""tactical"" about this game, its predominantly run and gun with no iron sights.Overall, a weak CS clone 15 years too late. Its free, but I dont consider it worth the effort when there are for more polished ftp multiplayer shooters available.			"

												tactical intervention has lots of pontential, it just doesn't live up to it. it's a really fun game, but the controlls are awful. driving is so sensitive you usually get into a embarrassing crash that makes you  lose 15 seconds into getting into the car. the only 3 things i like about the cars is that they're stylish, you can break into pedestrians cars just like GTA only easier. and the third reason is that when you force pedestrians out of their car, they get to the ground with their hands over their heads. i usually kill them when they do that. also, you don't want to know how many times i entered a game so glitched that i slid (not walked), i stood still (while i slid) and i couldn't use any of my weapons. the game also has good things about it. it's really gory, and it's free to play! i'm talkin' gory-er than GTA! the fact that you could use people as meatshields and you could lean and shoot out of cars really got people exited, but there's draw-backs.for the meatshields, it doesn't protect your whole body, so you better hope your enemy isn't an accurate shooter. for the cars, your driver usually squishes you against a wall and kills you any way. the last thing is the shop. if your thinking about getting the game, listen to this before you waste your MB's and GB's: you can't buy things, you can only rent them. i mean you CAN buy things, but it costs 3 times as much as renting it, and even renting costs alot. i give a 8.5 out of 10. if you want to get a better free to play fps expierence, go for team fortress 2 ( i made a reccomendation for it. chek it out).

												I downloaded this game when the ""Free to play"" part of steam showed every F2P game on steam and not just a short ""Highlight"" list of games. I dug through the fps section untill I found one that looked like CS:GO, and this game was just what I wanted. I don't really remember much about this game, but I believe there was a mode where you could shoot you'r team mates, and thats all I did, can't really say much else. I did like the graphics, but that was about three or more years ago, and the guns and such looked pretty cool. All and all I'd r8 this game pretty highly, but I refuse to become a cleshay and as such won't give every game a ""something out of ten"" r8ing. I do would  recomend this game, but it really needs a ./dance command, like WOW.			"

												Please read this review all the way through to understand why I don't recommend it.I heard about this game first on MMOhuts F2P FPS games on steam. Its main claim to fame was the fact that Goosemas one of the guys who worked on the original counter strike had helped create this. I looked trough some reviews (not Steam reviews) and thought it looked good so here were my first impressionsThe Technical stuffThis game runs off the source engine as you might expect. It's not breaking any grounds in sound design or its graphics. Gameplay offers a little variety with a mechanic that allows you to lean in an out of cover and to ""blindshoot."" If their are hostages on the map you cna use those as shields whitch is kinda cool. Stuff I like I like the roll and leaning mechanics and the guns are fun to use. Stuff I don't likeThis game is definitely pay to win and you can tell who dropped some cash in this game. The recoil shakes the screen LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BElIEVE. Hit detection is super hit and miss. The hud can be a littled cluttered at times and the community is hard to bear. I wouuld recommed this game to some one who wants to get ""counter strike"" but can't afford it. If you already have counter strike or don't want to bear a grind I DON'T recommend it. Sorry Goosemas they can't all be winners. "

												I honestly think that if the devs were to retitle this game as ""Hollywood Car Chase Simulator 2014"", this game would sell like hotcakes. Dead serious.Anyway, let's get on to the actual review: Tactical Intervention is an FPS that is quite ironically the least tactical game you will ever play. But does that make it bad? Of course not. Tactical Intervention has quite a few charm points, which I genuinely think you should try out at least once.THE GOOD:As stated in the title, Tactical Intervention features a car chase game mode, in which the Terrorist team is given 1-3 cars to chase after a Counter-Terrorist VIP, who is also in a car. The mode is hilariously glitchy, but in an incredibly fun way, as referenced by STAR_ in his ""Tactical Intervention 1.6"" video.Another thing I genuinely appreciate from the dev team is their attention towards the playerbase. A lot of people (myself included) complained about the recoil system in that it was too spazzy (your screen would literally shake up and down frantically as you fired). Within a month, they fixed the recoil system, so shoutout to FIX Korea for their totally bro devs!The guns in this game are something which I feel more game devs should take note of. All of the guns are very well balanced (with 1 or 2 outliers, but you can't be perfect), and each have a role- Sniper/Marksman Rifles are for Long Range, Assault Rifles are for Mid Range, SMGs are for Close Range, and Shotguns are for Point Blank. The guns have a customization system, allow you to purchase silencers, optics, compensators, flashlights, and weapon camos.Oh, and did I mention that this game does a great job of the whole F2P thing? The in game economy is similar to TF2, in that the only cash-only items in the game are character models and weapon skins.THE BAD:You probably only heard of Tactical Intervention because you clicked on the ""Free-To-Play"" section in the Steam Store. Well, that's another problem with TI. The playerbase is very, very, very small. The number of concurrent players is literally smaller than the entire population of Vatican City. Go ahead and take a moment to Google that if you wish. It's not uncommon to meet the exact same people day after day, and that means that if you happen to come upon a toxic player, guess what? You're probably gonna see them again before the day's over.I did say that most of the weapons in TI are well balanced, but there are some outliers. And quite frankly, those outliers are really damn powerful. The AS50, a semi-automatic .50 caliber anti-material rifle, has the ability to kill a player in one shot- yes, you read that correctly- to ANY part of the body (unless you buy armor, but most people don't know about the existence of armor). Sure, it has a ton of scope sway to compensate, but you can noscope with it very easily, making it a threat in CQC. Another unbalanced weapon is the M4 STAR 10, known commonly as the M4 Super 90. The Super 90 is a 12 guage, semi-automatic shotgun with a very high rate of fire, and an uncomfortably long range. Its running accuracy is damn high, too, meaning that you can literally bumrush a group of people face first, and probably kill them. All of them. What makes it worse is that all the guns in the game can be bought with IGC (in game currency), so your average noob can buy a Super 90 literally the moment he boots up the game (all players start with $50000, just enough to buy a Super 90)THE UGLY:As mentioned in the Bad section, the playerbase is very small. And I really don't mean to make fun of anyone by saying this, but 90% of players literally have no clue what they're doing. Like, if you go into an S&D server, you'll see people shooting at the bomb. Even if you tell them to hold down F. Which is another problem with the game- since its F2P, the vast majority of players are from BRIC (Brazil/India/Russia/China), or some equally foreign country like Poland or Peru. I don't know if it's out of ignorance or hatred or both, but pretty much no one speaks English, and some people will even go as far as to make fun of you for doing so. Which is ironic, since everyone plays on the AMERICAN servers. Speaking of servers, why do the non-americans play on American servers, and then complain about all the lag?!?! Like, go into your average lobby, and I guarantee at least 80% of the pings will be above 100.CONCLUSION:Don't take the game too seriously (or seriously at all, for that matter), and you'll be just fine. TI is a nice game to blow off some steam, but just like Quake, it's a minimalistic game, meaning there's no unlockables or anything like that, so don't be surprised if you quickly decide that you're bored of the game.6/10			"

												This is a very well thought out game. It is so bad, that it makes you come back to play it after experiencing one of the most horrible gameplays you can. It was a good distraction when my girlfriend broke up with me and it helped me appreciate everything in life since I can always play this game when I am depressed. This game is for depressed people.

												I downloaded this game when the ""Free to play"" part of steam showed every F2P game on steam and not just a short ""Highlight"" list of games. I dug through the fps section untill I found one that looked like CS:GO, and this game was just what I wanted. I don't really remember much about this game, but I believe there was a mode where you could shoot you'r team mates, and thats all I did, can't really say much else. I did like the graphics, but that was about three or more years ago, and the guns and such looked pretty cool. All and all I'd r8 this game pretty highly, but I refuse to become a cleshay and as such won't give every game a ""something out of ten"" r8ing. I do would  recomend this game, but it really needs a ./dance command, like WOW.			"

												tactical intervention has lots of pontential, it just doesn't live up to it. it's a really fun game, but the controlls are awful. driving is so sensitive you usually get into a embarrassing crash that makes you  lose 15 seconds into getting into the car. the only 3 things i like about the cars is that they're stylish, you can break into pedestrians cars just like GTA only easier. and the third reason is that when you force pedestrians out of their car, they get to the ground with their hands over their heads. i usually kill them when they do that. also, you don't want to know how many times i entered a game so glitched that i slid (not walked), i stood still (while i slid) and i couldn't use any of my weapons. the game also has good things about it. it's really gory, and it's free to play! i'm talkin' gory-er than GTA! the fact that you could use people as meatshields and you could lean and shoot out of cars really got people exited, but there's draw-backs.for the meatshields, it doesn't protect your whole body, so you better hope your enemy isn't an accurate shooter. for the cars, your driver usually squishes you against a wall and kills you any way. the last thing is the shop. if your thinking about getting the game, listen to this before you waste your MB's and GB's: you can't buy things, you can only rent them. i mean you CAN buy things, but it costs 3 times as much as renting it, and even renting costs alot. i give a 8.5 out of 10. if you want to get a better free to play fps expierence, go for team fortress 2 ( i made a reccomendation for it. chek it out).

												VERY FUN!  This highly addictive FPS from the creator of the Counter Strike Series is like the spiritual successor to the original games.  There are the classic game modes we know and love: Bomb Defusal and Hostage Rescue.  However there are several new gamemodes: VIP Escort (Drive the VIP to an extraction point), VIP Escort On Foot (Lead the VIP to the extraction point on a close quarters map on foot), Team Death Match (10 second respawn close quarters combat), and the newer hostage rescue which is the one I mentioned above (Capture hostages as a Terrorist for a few rounds and then contain them or capture hostages from the Terrorists and attack as a COunter-Terrorist).  This game has many features the old Counter-Strike did not have like: RPGs and M320 Grenade Launchers, cars, new loadout and purchasing systems, fast roping down the sides of buildings, levolution when a bomb detonates, new guns, pick up ammo off of a dead teammate or dead enemy, heal your teammates, new knife, new player animations and new NPC animations and AI, the ability to look down and see your legs, better graphics, more video display options and power saving options, perks, kill streaks, attack dogs, character customization, new maps, new voting systems, private server creator and much more!  All in all, this is a very impressive game, all we need are more amped graphics while the current graphics are good and the ability to aim on all weapons since technically this is not Counter-Strike and it helps bring a whole new level of skill to the game.  So in the end, YES! I would recommend this game.			"

												I would much rather shove a knife up my @ss than play this again.This has got to be one of the worst games ever. Horrible textures, unbalanced weapons, stupid systems, the list goes onFirst off, the game looks like shjt. Literal shjt. I've seen better out of Roblox. One of the things you'll notice is that the weapons are horribly unbalanced. there is very little way your skill can really affect how you perform. After deciding to buy one of these OP guns, i noticed the purchasing system was the worst i've ever seen. You can choose to either buy for 1 day, 7 days, or permanently. And there are options to buy with either in-game points, or real money. REAL MONEY. A lot of items such as crates are only obtainable through purchasing with real moneyThe layout of the shop screens and all that is quite confusing and cluttered. Its hard to get used to where everything is, how to set profiles, and equip items. One thing that i can't get over is the lack of aiming down sights. This isnt an issue in games like CSGO because you can fire accurately by simply standing still. In this, its hard to kill someone across the room with most guns, as well as the fact that its relatively fast paced, so you cant stand still. Controls are a little strange, the Q and E keys can be used to lean, but are awkward and unnatural to press, cause you cant have your finger on W at the same time. Pressing Q and E at the same time enables blind fire mode, letting you shoot from behind cover without exposing yourself. And to top it all off, I had numerous connection issues, causing me to get kicked out of the game.This game recieves -6 Golden Bananas+ out of Shigeru Miyamoto1/10 wouldn't bang    -IGN22/500,000 super shjtty    -Destructoid0/5 Massively ♥♥♥♥y and Bad    -Me			"

												if cs go and supra mayro krat had a baby and they both had different numbers of chromosomes, then cs:go was pushed down the stairs and beaten severly (although domestic abuse is no laughing matter). The baby would still be a better game than this one. But you can go ghetto and so for that reason alone square root of -1/10			"

												Being able to glitch into an enemy and kill them while then glitching into a car and flying into the sky makes this the most hardcore tactical game you will ever play. 2/10 would play again.			"

												Are you in a multiplayer rut?  Has it been more then 100 hours since you last played something different?Tactical Intervention breaks the mundane cycle of only playing one title allowing you to spend your first 30-60 minutes setting up individual character slots with weapons/ammo/gear.  You then join a game and are immediately faced with the realization that all your weapons in every slot have been restricted by the server.So?!  This is how it goes down:  You hit that submit button and knock every level-16 badass unconscious with the single pistol the server so thoughtfully allowed you to have.  Will open review again pending the next 100 hours in Left4Dead2.			"

												This game is like a free version of counter-strike with a few major differences. Don't expect a super serious fps with a moody teenage fanbase, instead expect a crazed frenzy with a few blokes with good senses of humor. I love this game, even though it is hard to make credits and has a strange hiring sytem. With a few shoutouts this game has the potential to be very popular indeed.  10/10 Stonngly reccomended Edit: Looking at most of the negative reviews for this game one will observe that they seem to nitpick a lot and all seem to say things that are not helpful at all, mostly things like: dear developers, eat♥♥♥♥♥♥ Please stop this, these comments are NOT helpful and just add negative hype to a (in my opinion) rather good game. If you are thinking about getting this game and spending time please dont listen to the stupid, spammy, negative reviews that tis game seems to get so many of.			"

												The game plays relatively smoothly and seamlessly, but there are several problems with it.First and foremost, there's the problem with the hit detection and damage counter. When you die, you often see things like ""You were hit 2 times for 165 damage. You hit them 12 times for 40 damage."" It doesn't take a genius to determine that that's just not feasible. Sometimes, I even ""get hit 0 times for 100+ damage"", proving that there is something seriously wrong with core mechanics in the combat system.Second of all, the weapon balancing for certain weapons is absolutely broken, especially concerning the AS50 rifle and the M4 STAR 10. The AS50 not only deals 2.5 times as much damage as the maximum health of a player, it is essentially a substitute for short-range weapons like shotguns, which is highly uncharacteristic of a sniper rifle and frankly ruins the game.Speaking of shotguns, the M4 STAR 10 semiautomatic shotgun is also extremely overpowered. Its one-shot capability and blistering rate of fire make it virtually unbeatable. Anyone who uses either of these guns frankly takes all the fun out of everyone else's experience.The game has potential, but the inherent flaws in the combat system and overpowered weapons completely ruin the game.
