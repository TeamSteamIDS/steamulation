												I expected very little of Swords and Soldiers (S&S), as it was an extra, unknown game in a Humble Bundle that started its life as a console game. I was pleasantly surprised!S&S is a curious blend of two genres I don't usually enjoy: 2D side scroller and RTS. However, five minutes into the game, I could see through the cutesy graphics and I found a game of surprising challenge and deep gameplay. S&S is now available for tablet play, but it's far more challenging than the average casual tablet game.Without going into the game mechanics, I'll briefly say that the challenge of S&S is about recruiting the right balance of each unit type into your army to make your forces competitive in groups. Also, staying focused on the big picture while also assisting your units at the strategic level. The game plays at a very brisk pace, which makes it difficult to manage all aspects of your forces at once.The levels are bite-sized; about 5-15 minutes each, perfect for a game that was born as a mobile app. But the levels become increasingly more complex. A couple of hours into S&S, and you'll find a staggering number of things that you have to manage simultaneously. You have to juggle more and more types of units and one-off attacks to reach victory in each new level.S&S also includes an online mode for playing competitively against friends.If you like RTS games, give this a go. It's a pretty good game at a budget price. As for me? Lesson learned: Play every game. I expected little, but Swords and Soldiers impressed me.			"

												I got this from someone, as a trade. Totally worth it. I'm a indie lover and this is exactly what I love. It's simple, really cartoonish, and you don't get bored fast. The price I think is a little too big. Just wait for a 50-75% off and buy it. Achievements are challenging, which is great. Not too easy, not too hard.There aren't so many players who still play this game, but at a reasonably hour, you usually find a guy after a few minutes. They always beat the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me.No cons.9.7/10.			"

												I really enjoy this game. It's simplicity I found was very... Enjoyable. It is incredibly fun, and feels very rewarding when you defeat the enemy. Even if you discover the best techinque for victory, the game will change slightly and force you to adapt your strategy little by little. The challenges that the enemies pose are also very fun to oust. The story and characters are hilarious, and they make the campaing a lot of fun to follow. Vikings chasing pirates around the world because they disrupted a barbaque, for example. I would seriously recommend trying Swords and Soldiers.			"

												Swords and Soldiers HD is another of these mobile-like games that's made it onto PC and it's immediately apparent when you play it that it was not created for any kind of sophisticated controller. Even this incredibly simple gameplay is in sore need of a keybinding or two. That being it's not a terrible game. The simplicity does have some advantages and the cutesy humor helps you endure it. It is however, not a game I'd recommend anyone buy at anything remotely close to what they're asking for it, it is basically a flash game made with the simplest of tools and there are many better alternatives in actual free flash games and mods for various strategy games.

												I think this game could potentially be racist based on the representation of races/nations? Anyway, it's a cute compact version of the RTS genre. I played the singleplayer exclusively which gave me a couple hours of fun but nothing too extensive. As everything else with AI there's a skirmish mode so you can just play a regular game against the AI. I found some of the difficulty balance was a little off. Most levels were easy enough but the hard ones were extremely difficult. There were only one or two of those, though. Overall I had a good amount of fun with the singleplayer. It began to become a little repetitive after a while as some missions were just ""kill the other guys"" but I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in playing it.			"

												This game is nothing more than an over priced flash game. For the campaign the AI doesn't even count it's gold income so you can suffer from a lack of gold, but the computer never will.

												This game has some serious pacing and balance issues. Some levels are so easy they can barely be considered entertaining, others are so hard you're left wondering if there's some hidden mechanic you're missing that's necessary to play the game. Also the enemy in Story mode doesn't seem to follow any of the same rules the player is forced to in terms of gold or mana accrual. Even if you kill all of their workers they seem to have no trouble finding gold to spawn new units as quickly as possible (unit cooldowns also don't seem to apply for them). What this means for gameplay is that you have to follow the pattern they set for you or you're quickly overwhelmed. Which makes this not a game. It makes it a set of instructions. The graphics are pretty but not particularly so. The music is fitting but not particularly so. The story is amusing but not particularly so. Pretty much the entire game left me with that ""Yeah, and?"" kind of feeling.If you're a superfan of tower defense games or really simple strategy toys, consider picking this up during a sale for at least 80% off of it's retail price (9.99 as of 7/7/15). Otherwise, I'd avoid this title completely.Disclosure: I did not buy this game directly but instead received it as part of a Humble Bundle. This is not the sort of game I would typically consume, so I may not be the most reliable reviewer.			"

												Opening this game for the first time I was greeted not with a main menu... but with a popup for dlc...I was most confused upon closing the window steam poped up wanted to charge my credit card £3.99.As if it was a shoddy tablet port? Nooo... Whole UI is driven by the mouse with awkward touchscreen buttons, lacking any keyboard bindings or control, aside from typing your name the game regugatates back at you during dialogs.The mouse has imense input lag, mainly to both vsync and tripple buffering being forced on.Gameplay is enteraining for it's simplicity, but slowly devolves into rushing 10 miners and spamming units as fast as possible.

												Swords and Soldiers is a goofy 2D real time strategy with simplistic gameplay and dead multiplayer.You can play as three races: the Aztecs, whose leaders have awesome names like “Fulthrotl” and “Luvsbatl”; the Vikings, who can summon Thor; and the Chinese, whose melee unit, swordsmen, yell “ayyyy chop chop” when spawned. I laugh every time then feel dirty afterward.The graphics are sprightly and pleasant. The music isn’t annoying—an important consideration when you must listen to the same set of tunes all game—and even catchy at times. The sound is funny—ayyy chop chop, damn it. The gold gathering units are all women whom are referred to as “gold diggers.” I giggled.I feel as if I’m listing bullet points. I feel as if this stinks of dysphemism, as if I’m hedging my honesty though I’m not. One of the reviewers states that he has nothing negative to say about Swords and Soldiers; this is true for me too, but I also can’t find any salient positives. The game’s aesthetic, especially the humor, is its greatest boon. The gameplay is a bit shallow which betrays its mobile roots. I ENJOYED playing through the campaigns, but I also don’t desire to ever replay the game again.Swords and Soldiers is simple: you gather gold to purchase units and spells, and units move ever forward until they’re destroyed or demolish the enemy’s base. Spells use mana, which replenishes at a steady rate which can be increased via upgrades, when cast and make up half of the S&S’ complexity. All “skill” in this game culminates in your ability to spawn or spam the rights units while using spells correctly. That’s essentially it; as long as you can spawn units with minimum deference to insuring the units work together (i.e., not spawning ten of the same unit but you know, mixing it up a bit!) and not spamming your spells so that you aren’t left high and dry to an ayyy chop chop invasion, you pretty much win. The campaigns squelch this flaw by hamstringing the player in some way. Objectives are often more than lolsmash the enemy to pieces. The story mode is entertaining because it works against the shallow gameplay.Hence my conundrum. I enjoyed the handicaps and weird objectives of the single player, but without the constrictions as an impetus, Swords and Soldiers isn’t all that fun. Essentially, it’s the prototypical mobile game: fun in short bursts as the medium requires but without any staying power.			"

												Swords and Soldiers is a ton of fun. It combines simple base building with fastpaced action. Your units have to fight incoming enemies and, most commonly, destroy the enemy base. You can't control your units yourself, but you can aid them with upgrades, spells and other specials. Things get intense pretty fast and it really keeps you on your toes, though it never gets unfair. The cartoon style and the humour add to the fun atmosphere of the game. Check it out, it's worth the money!			"

												More Reviews @ TheVideogameBacklog.comHaving played the sequel on the Wii U at PAX 2014, I was excited to see how Swords & Soldiers HD held up to its younger brother. It’s not as fancy as the sequel, but still has all of the charm that grabbed me when I played Swords & Soldiers II. The factions feel different from each other and each need their own tactics to be played well. Without anymore babbling on, let’s get into it!The Swords & Soldiers series come off as basic and cartoony. It’s almost a little too basic to grab my attention if I had just seen a video. This is another example of why you shouldn’t base your opinion on a game solely on looks. (I’m going to have to get over that since it appears that I’ve said that a lot lately.) I know it’s getting harder and harder to do with how graphics are shaping up these days, but with all this good content out there with simple graphic schemes, it’s important to try a game out before one blows it off completely.So without all the fancy-schmancy HD-ness of its sequel, Swords & Soldiers HD focuses on fun gameplay with some deep gameplay/tactical decisions. You’ve got to carefully manage how you work your available options because the slightest misstep could cost you the game. (That sounds overly dramatic, but it has happened to me.) Do you need to create more gold miners or get some research done to build some fighters to apply pressure onto your opponent. What type of unit do you research first? Want a slow heavy-hitter or a ranged (but low HP) user? Eventually you’ll have everything researched, but you may find it in your best interest to not do everything up front lest you find yourself with all the options in the book, but no money or defenses when the enemy comes a-knocking.All of the factions feel completely different and I like that. As impressed as I was that the sequel not have reskinned armies with the same abilities, the same applies here. You’ll obviously have a few units that play similar, but with enough differences to make you wish that your unit could either poison others or rush into fights. It’s give-and-take all while each army has their appeal and that’s what’s so great: having options. Not only are the units available different, but how your basic game mechanics work are also different. Everyone has passive mana regen, but how you get more differs from faction to faction.The Aztecs have to sacrifice units in order to gain more mana faster. Personally, they are the hardest to play. I just can’t seem to strike the balance between building my army/defense and figuring out how to get the 350 mana needed to pull off my super move. I’m also not used to sacrificing my own units. The Chinese run almost similar to the Vikings except they abandon defensive towers in favor of towers that help regen mana quicker. I get it, and I’ve actually won matches as both factions, but two out of three factions just don’t do it for me. I’m not sure if it’s the fact that the Vikings look like Dwarves or that they are simple in execution. The Vikings are pretty straight forward: economy, defense, damage. I know that tends to be my thing, but I do believe no single game has pigeon-holed me so well into one specific faction.Score: Gewd.Swords & Soldiers HD is a solid game. All three factions offer distinctively different ways to play the game and that’s very cool. The fact that I can’t very well play two of them is more on me than it is the game itself.  I know this is more of a multiplayer game for those competitive sorts, but the campaign does offer a good fun story packed with humor and is worth the purchase in and of itself. While the game is pretty good, it’s getting older now since the sequel is coming out and having played both, Swords & Soldiers II will probably be the favored son. I’d recommend picking Swords & Soldiers HD up when it’s on sale to play it as well as support a good developer.			"

												I got this in an indie game pack, expecting it to be little to no fun: a simple iPhone port.  I tried it out because I needed something to kill five or ten minutes here and there and, lo and behold, it's actually a fantastic little game.The gameplay is simple enough and the game never becomes too challenging (there is one level that gives me trouble), but it's quite a bit of quick fun.  It plays somewhat like an RTS (in that there are miners and you use those resources to create units), but also like a tower defense game (destroy their tower before you lose yours).  While this may seem like a limiting factor in how the game plays (my original impression), it actually creates for quite a bit of strategy.

												The mechanic in this game is really simple.  You purchase units, and once they're purchased they go off in a linear fashion to do whatever it is they do.  You have very little control over all the action.  Still, that simplicity is hidden behind some really good art direction.  It is funny and maybe even 'cute'.  In the end, this is a good one to pick up from the $5 bin.			"

												Polished, would be one word I could use to describe Swords & Soldiers.Along with horrifingly addicting, as well as just sheer awesomeness.You play three highly unique classes, the Vikings, the Aztecs, and the ChineseThe motivation behind them is ridicolous from winning a chili contest, to acquiring said vegetable for BBQ sauce. Swords and Soldiers is not something I would call the next stage in indie development. However just a well-honed game, and enough tweaks and tiny additions, gives the euphora you are playing something new, and yet so familiar at the same time. 9.3/10			"

Features a scoreboard to compare with other players.Overall: 6.5/10(8/10 if it was longer)1/10 online(...pretty much dead, would've been fun otherwise)			"

												Great, but sometimes, frustrating game. It's a 2D tower defense where you basically select which units will spawn, and the game will do the rest. That means walking and fighting. You can help your units by casting spells on friendlies or enemies as well. Like I said, sometimes it's frustrating because the AI seems to play unfair every now and then by spawning enemies endlessly. But the missions can all be completed, it just takes a little longer than expected when this happens, making the game a bit unbalanced. There are three factions, all with their own unique units and they're really fun to play. They all have their own playstyle and about 10 missions each.The artstyle is awesome by the way, I really liked the sharp and cute graphics.[Rating: 79/100]			"

												Very interesting take on the RTS genre. Simplified down to 2D side scrolling. Send your guys out from your base, and they fight your opponent's guys until they die. Use mana to cast helpful spells to aid your guys and hurt your enemies. Much less decision making to do than other RTS games, but just as consequential when you do it. Suffers a fair bit from balance issues in PvP but that is almost to be expected. The humor is nice, but not exactly side-splitting. 4/5			"

												Another one of those casual mindless 2D scrolling click-click strategy games. This one is actually done pretty well providing a decent assortment of different troops and upgrades. It's much better than Alien Hallway and actually requires some mild strategy as opposed to just speed building. Although once you figure out how to swap gold for mana, you pretty much just roll over the enemy--literally. A cute story also adds to the entertainment factor. The campign chapters are just about the perfect length to stop and take a break since the fun starts to wear down quickly if you play any longer.			"

												Although I like the work Romino games has done with Awesomenauts, this one missed the mark for me. The game was designed for consoles and mobile devices but unlike some other games from that arena, missed the mark for me on the PC. Although there is undoubtedly strategy involved in sending your minions strolling along the path to the enemy, I, for the most part, still seemed to just be spamming guys along. Just had to be a little careful in what I spammed. As with a lot of my other not-recommended games, if you're looking for a simple game to have some fun or kill some time, there are much better games available than this one.			"

												Tug of war style game where you mine gold with builder which you use to build units to send down to destroy the enemies base and defend yours.  You can't directly control your units but you can use mana to cast spells to affect the flow of battle.  Units and spells must be bought first with gold before you can use them.  There are 3 diffrent races with diffrent units and spells to use.			"

												SaS to taki dosyć nietypowy RTS w sumie. To znaczy powołane jednostki same lezą w wir walki, albo wydobywają surowce. Gra jest w żartobliwych tonacjach, ładnie rysowana. I nawet fajnie się gra, też ją kupiłem za 20zł i nie żałuję. Natomiast fajniejszy od głównego trybu rozgrywki jest tryb bonusowy, gdzie idzie jedna postać, a gracz czuwa nad jej drogą rzucając odpowiednie czary w odpowiednich momentach.			"

												A fun side-scrolling strategy game. You don't build any buildings (besides towers) so it's all about building units and research. There is a story mode that teaches you how to play and how to use the different units of the game. It's shown in a cartoony manner, with over-the-top characters fighting over stuff like a giant pepper. The different races can play very differently so that adds some complexity to the game. But at its core the gameplay is simple and straightforward. Combat units automatically march towards the enemy base and will engage the first enemy they meet. You can gain magic skills that allow you to interact more directly in the combat. So managing which units to build, which things to research, and which spells to use is how the game plays out.A fun game with quick little missions that can entertain strategy game fans.			"

												Swords and Soldiers HD is essentially a simplified 2D RTS game. Rather than having to also micro manage your army, the gameplay revolves around the macro aspect, in particular producing worker and units, using global abilities, and researching. It's a fun time-killer and can be surprisingly difficult at times while playing the campaign.  The only downside is that the campaign isn't long, but it has replayability in skirmishes and multiplayer mode. Overall it's a recommended game for those looking for a simple game to play in small bursts.			"

												I only wanted to try this game in case I would prefer a refund, and after a few minutes playing, I really thought it wasn't worth the price and strongly consider it. Still, playing brought me almost at the end of the second campaign after two hours of pleasant playing -so that refund is now out of question. Is it good ? That's not so easy to tell. It feels like a mobile game, and it is quite simplistic. You click on units to spawn them, and they walk relentlessly towards the enemies coming from the right. You can use spells also, which are crucial to succeed. In the campaign, there are two major kinds of goals: Hold on for some time as your base is continually attacked, or destroy the enemy base. There are three available factions: Vikings, Aztecs, and Chinese. All of them are quite different and you have to adjust your gameplay, which is a good thing for sure. However there are not many different units per faction, but the fun is they are all different enough, so I guess it's okay. Overall, it is fun, missions are less than 10 minutes long, which I deem as an advantage. Achievements also are creative and not so easy to unlock (there are not basic grinding or ""end the game in difficulty mode i"" for i from 1 to 5). CONCLUSION:Don't spend the full price for it, it's not worth it. But in sale, you might want to consider adding it to your library, as it is nice, fun, casual, and yet challenging enough.  "

												Swords and Soldiers is a simple point and click lane based strategy game.While there is no micromanagement on multiple resources and buildings,there is the strategy of time and space on deployment of units and powers that can change the tides of a battle.There is 3 playable factions with one campaign each,the 3 campaigns feel like extensive training sections to each faction with some twists thrown on the middle,story wise there is some jokes here and there but nothing complex,it is somehow entertaining with its light humor.Each faction has its  mini tech tree and focus on a different  playstyle: the Vikings focus more on resistance and strentgh of units,the Aztecs focus more on devastating powers and the Chinese on counter attack units.The multiplayer online,while a wasteland,you can wait the game search for an oponent,while enjoying the single player content.Some battles can end on a overwhelming defeat if the player doesn't have quick  thinking,making online matches sometimes not enjoyable.There is also 3  challenges that you unlock throughout the campaigns that can hook the player while he tries to improve his personal score,don't bother with the online rankings though,they are  completely broken. Overall a good looking and challenging indie game.Its DLC contain an extra campaign that,while use the core faction as the vikings,it is very varied putting the player on different situations while controlling units/powers from the other 2 factions,the DLC also contains a harder version from the boulder challenge,I recommend the DLC too.

												SaS to taki dosyć nietypowy RTS w sumie. To znaczy powołane jednostki same lezą w wir walki, albo wydobywają surowce. Gra jest w żartobliwych tonacjach, ładnie rysowana. I nawet fajnie się gra, też ją kupiłem za 20zł i nie żałuję. Natomiast fajniejszy od głównego trybu rozgrywki jest tryb bonusowy, gdzie idzie jedna postać, a gracz czuwa nad jej drogą rzucając odpowiednie czary w odpowiednich momentach.			"

												2D RTS. Limited map pool and some questionable balance. Fun and fast paced gameplay. May or may not be racist.			"

												An iOS port as it seems. Controls work fine on Mouse&Keyboard, but the game lacks depth. It's still an enjoyable experience for a short period of time, as levels don't last longer than a few minutes. Fight for food !!!			"

												A fantastic casual RTS game that's frantic fun with solid visuals and controls, there’s many classes to choose from that have unique abilities and an easy upgrade system that won't give any self-respecting gamers any headaches.			"

												RTS with platform view. Different idea but it works really well. You should buy this game, it has online play too. Go and buy it!			"
