												Here is a game that loses its appeal in about 30 minutes. Sure, the first 5 or 10 minutes you think the game is kinda cool, but by minute 15 you will have decided the game is a bit boring and repititous, by minute 30 you will have decided the game is no longer fun to play, and after 2 hours of game play you will think there are far better uses of Harddrive space than AaAaAA!!!  - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity.

												This game is like crack......not for everyone but if it's your thing you're gonna have a hard time stopping.I get the negative reviews for this game; it has indeed been superseeded by an improved version, (but if you're limited by  old hardware like I am this version has lower system requirements), and yes it is in a sense repetitive.... but it's a base jumping game, I honestly don't know what more people were hoping for. You jump off things, gravity takes over and you steer, as with actual base jumping.This game isnt rocket science, but it is challenging and although as stated above, it is the same basic action and objective in every level. However, the levels are massively varied and theres a few extra things thrown in, (hand gestures and spraypainting buildings with the mouse). Above all else this game is immersive and a huge ammount of fun, one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a long time.			"

												This is one of those games that you probably pulled out back when Steam used to do their sales events. Then you put it back away for a very long time. I don't blame you. It's fun for about 15 minutes, but then you just keep doing the same thing over and over again. There's only so much fun you can have in a game about jumping off buildings. Well....maybe that's not true, but there's only so much fun you can have in this game.You start each round by jumping off a building. Points are scored for getting close to objects without hitting them, interacting with people (thumbs up or flipping off), flying through certain gates, and sticking your landing. This gameplay can only interest you for so long. The controls work well enough while falling, except controlling after deploying your parachute can be a little awkward.The visuals are bright and intense, but not all that interesting. There are lots of flashing lights which could be problematic to some people. The music is fast and somewhat entertaining. Maybe the best part of the game.I could not recommend this game for more than a few minutes playtime. Fire it up if you got it in a bundle, but you will quickly put it back away.Grade: D+			"

												I really enjoyed this game, mostly because of its originality; most games aren’t about skydiving off buildings. I’ve come back to play it for a while, I want to say I’ve got about 2 hours into it. At this point, I need to replay some levels to get more points to unlock more stages, so I doubt I’ll play it again and beat it, but it was fun for the low price of whatever I got it for. Overall, I would recommend this if it’s cheap enough.			"

												An extremely simple concept, which often leads to very addictive games. Short description, you jump of things and try to hit the landing zone in one piece. Doing that is generally achievable. Doing it with high points, a bit more tricky, and therein lies the fun. It's kind of hard to describe, look at their promo stuff, they're not lying, it is a fun game. For the price, definitely worth it.			"

												Clever title, clever mechanics, clever bits of story/extra material. There isn't too much more that's good about the game. While it's fun to play for a bunch of the levels, it slowly decends to a kind of perfectionist/point ♥♥♥♥♥ style of gameplay where you can only advance if you play previous levels to excess to get more teeth (in-game currency) and allow you to unlock more levels. I wouldn't mind so much if the teeth values for most levels were significantly lowered, but having to play and 5-star the easiest level 200 times to unlock the next level is tedious. Other than the occasional ARG content, it's not worth playing past a certain point mid-way through what's available and leaves much to be desired.If you really want to play it: unlock all the little extra videos/audio content first, then see how far you can get. The extra little tidbits are genuinely hilarous by virtue of surreal humor. Generally: give this a miss.			"

												AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! – A Reckless Disregard for Gravity is a game in which you play a virtual basejumper who jumps through a series of maps attempting to rack up points by staying close to obstacles, spray-painting buildings, flipping off people who dislike you, and breaking plates with points on them while still landing safely. The levels are mostly very stylized (with a few which are meant to mimic natural landscapes). The game is very entertaining for the first bit, but is best experienced in bite-sized chunks. Once you've done a few levels, take a break and come back later - it can get repetitive rapidly, and while the later levels definitely add a lot more to keep track of, the core mechanics remain consistent.It's a pity, because the later levels are the better ones in the game, but ultimately, since the replayability is based off of the levels you've unlocked it doesn't feel like there's a great deal of depth beyond what you see on the surface.I had a good time with it. However, I've only played about 5 hours and I feel ""done"" with it - I don't have any particular desire to go back into it. If you're looking for a neat, stylized experience? Hard to do any better. Just don't expect a whole lot of play time for your dollars.			"

												accurate and heart-wrenching videogame adaptation of The Bridge, a 2006 Britsh-American documentary film by the acclaimed visionary Eric Steel. in AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity the player takes the role of an unnamed jumper reliving his leap off of the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge in purgatory, unlocking his way to heaven by falling down stylized levels while flying near buildings (hereby believed to be the game's way of portraying the monumental, almost skyscraper like undertaking of preparing for death) and flipping off spectators (perhaps a representation of the filmmaker's own Jungian psyche) among other objectives. It is the deepest game of the 21st century and is easily the greatest example of storytelling in any medium, the Citizen Kane of videogames, proving that interaction fiction can truly become art. Robert Ebert once remarked that this game made him reconsider his views on mortality and also jumping off of buildings. playing his game was a life-changing experience and immediately after playing i conspired to jump off a building with a parachute while trying to flip-off everyone i see on the way down.10/10 it's ok			"

												First of all: The title is awesome and it's a great example for the kind of humor that Dejobaan Games stands for. Now, what is this game about? There's no real story to speak of. You are some guy, who does BASE jumps from very large buildings. Don't mistake this game for some sort of simulation though, you don't just jump off of real skyscrapers, but rather interesting and fictional constructions and there is quite an array of things to do on your way down. The game is very highscore oriented, so the most replay value comes out of reaching the best score you possibly can on each level and while that could sound dull to some, I really enjoyed playing it.

												My Take: A frantic paced game where you attempt to reach perfection on each level and will not rest until you have five stars. Rude gesture to all the protesters out there.	Graphics: Simple polygons, but everything is distinctive enough that you can make out what's what during high speeds.Sound: Enough entertaining noises to distract you from how annoyed you are.Music: Not good enough to listen to on its own, but well suits the pace of the game.Controls: Standard look and movement bindings, but I should figure out better bindings for the other actions. I end up accidentally pressing a wrong key at inopportune times.Did I Finish It: Not 100%, but I got to the end.Will I Play it Again: Depends on how much content is in AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!, which I have yet to play. It's is supposed to have the same levels remastered, so I'm going to say no.Should You Buy It: If the above holds true, they're the same price so don't bother.			"

												Great music, good idea behind the game but hard to master.Why? Because if you want to make good scores, you have to be precise and avoid crashing on the buildings.This game is about jumping from the top of a building (or a mountain or anything else) and to pass near  every obstacle, to make a tag, to flip the bird or to make a cool gesture, to break plates with points on them, etc etc..The graphics are good but the real strong point of this game is the music. Dat soundtrack.Anyway, I really enjoyed that UFO from Dejobaan... if anything, it's thanks to Aaaaa that I played other games by them like Drunken Robot Pornography or The Wonderful End of the World.Really recommended for fun.

												AaAaAA!!! is a strange and unusual game. The premise being simple, score points by being wreckles while you base jump from floating structures. The gameplay is simple enough, control your decent, gain as many points as possible by ""hugging"" and ""kissing"" strucutres, hitting scoreplates and flipping off protesters.Part of AaAaAA!!!'s charm is that it's completely tongue-in-cheek as far as ""the man"" goes. It's a strange game that no one else has really managed to pull off with a correct mix of apathy for political agendas.Even the title theme gives a good hint as to the attitude of the game. While it may be oler, it's still a great experience to hop on every once in awhile and stands out as a shining unique experience.			"

Despite being palpably absurd, the aesthetic of the game manages to be believable in its own right, in a vein similar to Death Race 2000, perhaps, or Hackers.  In an alternate timeline where the fluke discovery of ""polystructures"" has radically changed human technology, culture, and society, the jaded and apathetic Gen Y crowd (undoubtedly much more so in this parallel world) apparently go in big for hurling yourself off of buildings and navigating floating metropolitan structures, all at risk of death.  Easy to lose yourself in, highly recommended.			"

You score more points by hanging close to buildings. You can also high-five admirers and give thumbs down to detractors as you fall down (if you see any).

												I had already played this game a bit before the Potato Sack promotion, but due to said promotion, I have finally had a chance to put a decent chunk fo time into it to make a recommendation. AaAaAA is a pretty fun - if sometimes frustrating - game which involves BASE jumping from the tops of skyscrapers, floating platforms, mountains and more. It is not a ""realistic"" BASE jumping simulation, though. The levels are crazy-insane and the game is rife with a twisted sense of humor, which all comes together to make AaAaAA a very unique experience. While some levels can be extremely challenging, failure usually leaves you with a ""just one more time"" feeling, rather than outright frustration. I thought AaAaAA was well worth the price of admission, and recommend it if you are looking for something completely fresh to kill some time.			"

Hope you're proud of your perplexing design decision because it ♥♥♥♥ed me up.As for the game itself, some levels have a bit of a super meat boy vibe of short levels with challenging manuvering, but sometimes they make the levels long so it's hard to practice them, especially the end of the level because it's hard to get to it.  Also it's a little needlessly unforgiving, such as falling on a 1 degree plane counting as falling onto flat ground, and catching the very corners of things should damage you sure but it just anihilates you instantly.Another really messed up thing is that they're offering a one-time-only achievement.

Motion sickness, the game.The title of the game is accurate. There's not a whole lot to say here - it's a well designed, simple concept that's extremely fun. I don't see myself playing this to the point of obsession, but I will definitely play until I unlock everything and see what else I can do with it. For those of you who are like me, and entirely too afraid to actually participate in extreme sports like base jumping, this will confirm your belief that you're really not cut out for it. You will be perfectly satisfied to sit in your chair, breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth, and imagine yourself floating to the ceiling. A fun little game that doesn't take itself too seriously, and has enough silly humor to make you smile - note that you won't laugh uproariously, but I don't believe that was the point of this, anyway. Gameplay is top notch, soundtrack is fun and funny, and I will definitely enjoy any time period in which I play this game, but I seriously doubt I will get addicted to it. One of those rare gems that's worth anyone's time, even iff you just have a few minutes to kill. I, personally, enjoy games that don't require a huge time investment in order to understand what they're about and have fun with them, and this is definitely the type where your boredom will die for a bit. Plus, after you play for an hour or so you'll exit and still feel like you're playing it. Neat. 8/10.(Small edit: I mean it's not very addictive. I meant to say that it was fun, but I don't see myself getting addicted to it. Fixed.)			"

												""A Reckless Disregard for Gravity"" is a game based on a simple concept: jump off a high point, do some sick tricks to earn points, and land on the ground safely. Despite many positive aspects, the game is marred by several technical and aesthetic choices made by the developers.The Good:* Unique use of humor.* Excellent sound track and sound effects.* The base-jumping mechanic is a new, innovate way of playing games. It is a joy to jump from your starting point and hear the rush of the wind blow across your avatar's ears.* Flight controls are good enough to seem realistic but forgiving enough to let you make a few mistakes and have fun. * Plenty of unique ways to score points: getting close to objects, staying close to objects, giving spectators a thumbs-up or an obscene gesture, and spraypainting graffiti were all things I found within my first hour or two of play.The Bad:* For the world's first base-jumping game, the game feels remarkably NOT like base-jumping. Rather than zooming along the side of tall skyscrapers and landing on the ground, the player instead navigates an obstacle course of abstract, floating blocks that stand to ""represent"" buildings and lands on a final circular block that is meant to represent the ground. If the player overshoots ""the ground,"" he continues to fall. Yes, you can actually miss the ground. Interestingly, the levels that feature base-jumping off a mountain feature a well-modeled and detailed mountain that actually resembles something like a real mountain. (If you are going to use aestheticized shapes to represent real-world objects, why not do it consistently?)* Every aspect of the game, from the UI to the action portion, looks and feels like a first-generation iPhone game. From the big, finger-friendly buttons conveniently placed on opposite corners of the screen, to the simplistic level design, to the generic graphics.* The simple level design gives the game a very low difficulty level. I understand the point of the game is to score points and not just to reach the bottom of the map, but I wish there were a few more levels where it would be a challenge to reach the landing pad.* Although there are several dozen levels (80), the variety of them is lacking. Each level is essentially the same as the last; none of them seem more or less fun than any others.* No backgrounds in any level. Every level has a simple color gradient for a background. How about at least a simple sky wallpaper?The Ugly:* The game has a horrible name. There is no way I am going to talk to my friends and be able to mention this game by name, which hurts word-of-mouth recommendations. It's as if the developers chose this name because they wanted to come first alphabetically, and then later released  ""1...2...3... Kick It"" when they realized that numbers precede letters in Steam's alphabetizing system.Verdict:Watch a few videos of the game online. Wou will have more fun watching other people play the game than doing it yourself.			"

												A lot of people seem to like this. I have no idea why. It a freefalling game where you have to do 'stunts' to gain points really. Except, it doesn't look like a freefalling game. Yes, you have the feeling you're falling down, but that's it really. It's all in first person perspective so there's no actual character involved as well. The idea is cool, but its execution is kind of poor. It would've been so much cooler to have a realistic freefalling game. Like the realism of Mirror's Edge and the freefalling/parachute gameplay of Just Cause 2. But that's all just in hindsight. So all in all; it's ok. There aren't a lot of games with this sort of gameplay so I can't really recommend any better alternatives.[Rating: 70/100]			"

												Very quicly loses its appeal. Nothing stands out in terms of gameplay, sound, graphics or replayability. Gameplay is even fickle at times, it's tough to say what will cause you to lose the level or what you will ""bounce"" off of. Played for as long as I did to try and unlock all the levels, but I had a really hard time trying to force myself to play. Not willing to go back to previous levels to get more in-game currency to unlock variations of the same mechanics copy and pasted across a wall of cubes. Not even sure if the game is ""beatable"", I'll be placing this title in the ""abandonware"" category of my library.			"

												A freestyle falling game where you're trying to score points by getting close to (but not running into) buildings. There's some interesting hidden things in some of the levels that you can try to collect, and the speed and difficulty increases as you unlock more levels. It's sort of mindless and you can zone out while playing. I wouldn't call it a stellar game, but if you have a few minutes to waste then this can work well enough.			"

												Only got this game mainly because of the competition, but its actually pretty fun. The basics is you use the wasd to controll your characters while hes falling and you do stuff during the fall to gain points before you get to the end and land...The design is strange and the presentation sucks, but the core gameplay is actually fun and you unlock new ""abilites"" during the way to keep the core game interesting. Add to that you can unlock any level you want from the level select screen you wont get bogged down on one level you cant get through. Gain rank in a level, 1-5 stars, gives you ""teeth"" points and these points are used to unlock new levels. The concept  works.The resolution could have been better, but I recommend it while its on sale at 75% off and the competition level is the first one to the left you can unlock next to the introduction text boxes. The ach is pretty simple and you can also view it on Youtube if you serach the level ""Mash Face Against Mountain"".			"

												Not bad. Fun for some mindless time filler.Also, pretty amusing and clever level names and descriptions.In short:You fall off buildings and--on the way down--try to score as many points as possible.You get points many ways...the main ways being ""hugging"" buildings (AKA flying close to them), ""kissing"" objects (AKA, touching a building), and landing within the outlined circle.Not hard to learn, but a little tricky to master.

												It has an awesome name.  What more do you need?This is a game for people who are obsessed with maximizing their score and topping the leaderboards, or at least topping yourself.  The game is entirely about navigating an artistic representation of an impossible city as you jump from the tallest building and weave your way through the concrete maze to land safely at the bottom.  On your way down, you'll collect bonuses for staying close to buildings as they whizz by and smashing through targets.  That's about it.  As you unlock more levels, the challenges get tougher, but this is a pretty fun distraction if you've got a few minutes to spare.			"

												Forever at the front of alphabatized gaming lists, AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA! has no genre.  It's radically different from most games, even other indie titles, and plays its individuality well-enough to actually be a good game.  At times, the game feels a bit repetitive, but that's negated by it letting you SKYDIVE FROM FLOATING SKYSCRAPERS.  This game induces adrenaline rushes at times, which is far more than can be said for a lot of games bar intense multiplayer games.  Give aaAaAA a shot, even if you don't like it, you'll never experience a game that tries to do what it succeeds in doing.			"

												They made a game about falling with style. The idea is simple, jump off a building and grab as many points as you can before pulling the chute. Unlike many games now that give you trivial goals to win, this game demands that you take the most exciting and dangerous route to the bottom. You won't get anywhere by taking the easy way out, you have to earn those five star ratings. Falling through the air is very fun, many levels are amazingly hectic, and getting five stars for a perfect fall after struggling through a challenge is extremely rewarding. I've had a ton of fun with this game.			"

												I know this Dejobaan game came before Drunken Robot Pornography, but I played DRP first, and amazingly, that game was actually easy compared to this one. Despite the fact that this game is frustrating as hell, it is still amazing. Graphically, right from the first spit second of the menu screen, this game is a thrill to play. Unlike DRP, this game says exactly what it entails, and that is the sound you'd be making if you were the protagonist in this game. You jump off a building, you scale buildings for points, you meet score quotas to earn stars which, in turn, earn you teeth which you use to unlock new levels. Again, like DRP, Dejobaan proves that you don't have to be complicated to be an amazing game. Just pair stunning visuals with great music and COUNTLESS levels. I've been playing this for a hours and i still haven't unlocked them all. And for a game where all you do is fall, that's pretty damn good.			"

												I know this Dejobaan game came before Drunken Robot Pornography, but I played DRP first, and amazingly, that game was actually easy compared to this one. Despite the fact that this game is frustrating as hell, it is still amazing. Graphically, right from the first spit second of the menu screen, this game is a thrill to play. Unlike DRP, this game says exactly what it entails, and that is the sound you'd be making if you were the protagonist in this game. You jump off a building, you scale buildings for points, you meet score quotas to earn stars which, in turn, earn you teeth which you use to unlock new levels. Again, like DRP, Dejobaan proves that you don't have to be complicated to be an amazing game. Just pair stunning visuals with great music and COUNTLESS levels. I've been playing this for a hours and i still haven't unlocked them all. And for a game where all you do is fall, that's pretty damn good.			"

												This game is good for people that really enjoy the indie game genre. When you look at the title ""AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity"" they aren't kidding. This game has an amazing techno - trance/rave soundtrack that always keeps you on the tips of your toes. The fact that this game puts you in the shoes of a free faller is great, and this is by far one of the most classic and memorable indie type games ever!			"

												Dejoban games offers a humorously refreshing look at the concept of ""video games"" and what they are meant to be as both a product for enjoyment as well as how they reflect upon the rest of the medium. This, in particular, chooses to parody the social core of video games while at the same time successfully offering an entertaining skydive simulation experience.TL:DR = Worth playing if you appreciate art.

												This is a really goofy game, with very... interesting humor. I thought it was pretty funny, at least.Basically, you jump off of a floating building, and try to get as many points as possible as you weave between buildings and through point squares. The game is an interesting balance of risk vs. reward... you get lots of points by doing one of several possible risky maneuvers, but doing them might send you to an untimely death.The idea is cool, but I got tired of it pretty quickly. Once I explored most of the levels, I really never felt like revisiting this game. I picked it up on sale for $2, and it was defintiely worth it for that price, but I couldn't recommend it at its full price of $10.			"

												This fast-paced game will keep you on the edge of your seats and your eyeballs screaming for moisture. In this game, you are basically free falling from the sky, down towards a small landing pad in which the journey from point A to B is littered with obstacles that you must maneuver to obtain massive points by scoring tricks.Controls are a little tough since even the slightest movements will crash you into the side of a building or you'll end up faceplanting some random obstacle at terminal velocity. There are plenty of levels and challenges to do so this game should keep you occupied for awhile. I'd say the difficulty of this game is up there and frustration is inevitable for certain challenges.

Watch the videos to get a better feel of what it's like.The content in the game is Hilarious, some of the comedy is on par with Napoleon Dynamite for just plain idiotic banter (and i love it!).This game will actually make you feel to go base jumping 75 years from now when cities look like those ingame.

												AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity is an average game built on a fairly unique concept of doing tricks while falling off fantasy suspended structures.  While the game does feature a wide variety of playmaps and modes, and the unlocking and teeth currency system are welcome, the game has some pretty noticeable flaws.  First and foremost is the lack of controller support, which given the twitch nature of the gameplay seems like a must.  Secondly, the game does not feature any interesting music and the sound effects particularly for the parachute are quite poor.  I had fun with this title for a few minutes, but the tedium grows as these flaws repeat over each game session.  I would recommend this game only to action fans who want a novel concept but caution others to stay away.			"

												A dropping/dodge buildings game. As you fall you must move out of the way of the buildings while collecting various items. Not much to this game but is extremely difficult due to the amount of effort required to move. Taking cures from gravity and such, pushing in one direction will slowly move you that way. The longer you push the faster you will move and the longer it takes to stop or change directions. Game mechanics work well if you know that you just cannot move around like other dodge games. Other than that, there is nothing more to this game.			"

												If you've ever wanted to base jump off a huge building than this again for you. It puts creativity to falling from the sky. The graphics alright. The music is really unique. It just has a charm that keeps you coming back for more. While falling you can give gestures to onlooking fans or give the bird to onlooking protesters. You can spray paint buildings on your way down. It's a very enjoyable game to relax to. The levels are very unique in style. There is much humor in this game and if you enjoy these type games then you won't regret buying it. A must-have for any wannabe skydiver!			"

												A skydiver's dream game.  Base jumping with points.  Easy to learn and controls are straight forward using WSAD. You're given a first person view of falIing.  As you fall you're able to guide yourself through point panels... through tunnels... building structures... and then you reach bottom and you must parachute into a large circle to complete the jump.  The jumps get progressively harder as you can imagine, and having a wide screen monitor or running Steam in ""big picture"" mode on your wide screen TV almost makes for some virtual reality feel to the game.  I wouldn't mind seeing a multiplayer mode for this game... or coop with both players competing for the points on the jumps.  Nice game... on sale.			"

YouTube™ Video: AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity PC Steam Review 

			Views: 648		

			If you rolled the skydiving game from Pilotwings in LSD and sent it hurtling into the future, you'd surely end up with something similar to A Reckless Disregard for Gravity.		

If you rolled the skydiving game from Pilotwings in LSD and sent it hurtling into the future, you’d surely end up with something similar to A Reckless Disregard for Gravity. The game is set in a psychedelic, alternate-reality version of Boston, Massachusetts in which buildings are nonsensically scattered throughout 3D space. This convoluted landscape provides the perfect playground for base jumpers with a reckless… you know. You play as one such base jumper from a first person perspective. Each level sees you taking a leap of faith from the tallest building, navigating your way through an architectural maze, then gracefully landing on a platform at then end. On your way down you rack up points by maneuvering dangerously close to obstacles and smashing through glass panels. As you progress you’ll unlock other abilities such as flipping off protesters and giving your fans a thumbs up. Snaking your way through a deadly obstacle course while chaining together the appropriate gestures is incredibly satisfying. It takes some time to get used to the controls, but the payoff is worth it. I would have liked to have seen joystick support, and the menu system could use some serious work, but otherwise A Reckless Disregard for Gravity is a clever game with a fun sense of humor that will leave you itching for one more jump.

												This game is more fun than it should be.  The game mechanic is unlike almost anything out there, the levels are similar to each other but with enough differences to keep it interesting, it offers high score challenges to accomodate any level of player and the humor and ""story"" of the game are all enjoyable.  Even the progress system as you choose levels and unlocks is fun and how often do you ever hear that about a game.			"

												Game aims to recapture extreme skydiving. It fails. Game gets the silly idea that skydiving would be more interesting with floating buildings... it just makes the game seem less immersive. The graphics heavily distract from the game, and don't add to it at all. They tried too hard to look hip, anot not enough time trying to be good. Game would have been significantly better if instead of going through the tricky level design, if they had just grabbed some 3d data of the world and made base jumping in famous locations. I can see their reason for their ""floating cities"" (to make their base jumping take longer) but if they're going to try that, they should at least make their floating cities look like floating cities above distant ground and not shipping containers being thrown at you by a wall of neon lava.I'm not normally one to complain about graphics (look at my other reviews if you don't believe me) but the graphics and level layout in this make the game horrible.

												Dejoban games offers a humorously refreshing look at the concept of ""video games"" and what they are meant to be as both a product for enjoyment as well as how they reflect upon the rest of the medium. This, in particular, chooses to parody the social core of video games while at the same time successfully offering an entertaining skydive simulation experience.TL:DR = Worth playing if you appreciate art. Still worth playing if you don't. A short experience either way.			"

												This fast-paced game will keep you on the edge of your seats and your eyeballs screaming for moisture. In this game, you are basically free falling from the sky, down towards a small landing pad in which the journey from point A to B is littered with obstacles that you must maneuver to obtain massive points by scoring tricks.Controls are a little tough since even the slightest movements will crash you into the side of a building or you'll end up faceplanting some random obstacle at terminal velocity. There are plenty of levels and challenges to do so this game should keep you occupied for awhile. I'd say the difficulty of this game is up there and frustration is inevitable for certain challenges. Overall though, decent game to have. Grab it when on sale.			"

												I dislike Dejobaan games, very much. They feel cheap and ill-maintained, as well as little consideration to practical functionality. On the other hand, that can all be overlooked with this one. Sure, the menu system is terrible, sure it takes too much effort to organize - but what a fun little game!The objective is basically to hug buildings, survive and land well; in that order. Hugging buildings is very fun - it can get tricky at times but that's the challenge really. The levels are a little short and I haven't unlocked the bigger, harder (?) ones - but for now i'm satisfied. Surviving is however easy to make it for yourself; those high points only come from kissing/hugging buildings (their terminology, I promise you). It takes some practice and a few quick-thinking moments but you can rack up those numbers. There's even 'bonus' things to smash.Lastly is landing safely; relatively easy to get it into the landing area.In summary - a great little mini-game, lazy developers.			"

The game mechanic is unlike almost anything out there, the levels are similar to each other but with enough differences to keep it interesting, it offers high score challenges to accomodate any level of player and the humor and ""story"" of the game are all enjoyable.

												Game aims to recapture extreme skydiving. It fails. Game gets the silly idea that skydiving would be more interesting with floating buildings... it just makes the game seem less immersive. The graphics heavily distract from the game, and don't add to it at all. They tried too hard to look hip, anot not enough time trying to be good. Game would have been significantly better if instead of going through the tricky level design, if they had just grabbed some 3d data of the world and made base jumping in famous locations. I can see their reason for their ""floating cities"" (to make their base jumping take longer) but if they're going to try that, they should at least make their floating cities look like floating cities above distant ground and not shipping containers being thrown at you by a wall of neon lava.I'm not normally one to complain about graphics (look at my other reviews if you don't believe me) but the graphics and level layout in this make the game horrible.

												One of a couple of base jumping games available on Steam. It's nothing special, fall while scoring points by staying close to objects without hitting them and trying to pickup extras where you can.

												There isn't anything in this game to hold your attention for an acceptable amount of time. It's fun for a brief few moments, but you'll just be doing the same thing over and over again. It's one of those games which doesn't really grasp the concept that fun isn't enough to support an entire game. Its entire draw is that the core gameplay is fun, but everything else is utterly lacking. There's no story and nothing to hope for as you progress through the game. You won't find yourself wondering if new game mechanics will be added. You won't find yourself wondering if a new upgrade will change how you play the game. You start the game, and then you have the option to keep playing forever. If you're a REALLY big fan of the engine and place no value in your time, then you might get more enjoyment out of this game than me. But it's 10 dollars! Don't spend that much money on a game like this! I can personally recommend a dozen flash games that will give you a more rewarding experience. Especially considering that they released a better version of this game which COSTS THE SAME AMOUNT!!They're trying to fleece you. That's the best way to describe this. You're given a little bit of fun at ten times the price it should be. The product that you're given isn't meant to stand the test of time at all. It's only meant to be good enough to keep you from complaining.			"
