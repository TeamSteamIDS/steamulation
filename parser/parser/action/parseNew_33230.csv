Introduction:We have all heard the phrase that “nothing beats the original” at least once in our lives. Assassin’s Creed II is a living testimony against these wise words. It is the much-improved sequel to its 2007 predecessor published by Ubisoft, and the first of a new trilogy of games (II, Brotherhood, and Revelations). While the first game in the franchise had a huge amount of potential, it fell a little bit short in the eyes of many. However, Assassin’s Creed II earned an almost unanimous critical acclaim - and with a good reason. Like the original installment, ACII remains an atmospheric historical fiction action-adventure sandbox. Setting it apart, however, is its new approach to less repetitive gameplay combined with solid story development… And yes, it does take the time to fill the majority of the plot holes left open from its forerunner.As a general warning, you should not read this section if you have not yet cleared the first game, and have the intention of doing so. There are minor spoilers ahead, for those of you who have not cleared the first installment of Assassin’s Creed.Story: This game picks up precisely where the first left off. Abstergo. Desmond remains a prisoner of the modern-day Templars, as he begins to comprehend the significance of his genetic memories - and the danger of the Apple of Eden falling into the wrong hands. Before he has too much time to brood, the game kicks off with a fast pace, springing Desmond from Abstergo, and introducing him to the modern-day Assassins. With their help, and their version of the Animus, Desmond submits himself to relive the experiences of another ancestor in hopes of becoming an assassin for their own cause. This time he finds himself in 15th-century Italy, at the height of the Renaissance, following the life of another ancestor called Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Ezio is a noble who finds himself betrayed by the cities rulers, and sets out on a quest for vengeance. Gameplay: There is a lot to be said about the mechanics and gameplay elements that Assassin’s Creed II introduced. Too often, a sequel is just a repeat of the first game, with a different storyline. This is not the case here. Ubisoft did an excellent job immersing the player in what is now a believable world, retaining some of its original mechanics. The beautifully designed free-running system from it’s forerunner has returned, only this time it permits the player to move faster: Thus, cover more ground in less time, and make exploration much more satisfying. As additional encouragement to explore the region, they have hidden treasure chests in every location - Low on coin? No problem! Either go find these hidden goodies, or just kill a guard and pick his pockets.I’d also like to take a moment to pay homage to the improved battle system. The combat aesthetics are absolutely stunning, making almost any fight appear brutal and bloody. Furthermore, you now have numerous weapons to pick from at the blacksmith shops, each offering its own selection of kill animations. The quests also have a more modernized efficiency to them, and appear on the map as exclamation marks to guide the player to the next objective. As I have previously stated, they are also a lot less repetitive. You no longer follow the same formula in each quest, which is hugely refreshing. Should Ezio run into trouble during any of these missions, he can opt to blend in just about any crowd of people, or purchase assistance from his allied factions: thieves, courtesans, and mercenaries. Just be careful not to draw too much unwanted attention, or you’ll have to go tear down wanted posters to reduce your notoriety. The purchasing system is really enjoyable. You can change the color of your robes, buy upgrades, weapons, armor, health potions, and even artwork. Once you reach the village of Monteriggioni, you can begin the process of renovating the city to generate your own income through your investments.Finally, keep an eye open for glyphs by using eagle vision. You won’t want to miss out on the story that their puzzles will reveal.Controls: The controls are relatively friendly, but no longer offer support with re-arranging your buttons. A controller is still the best way to get around, in my opinion, although you cannot re-assign your button placement at will this time. I still do not recommend playing this game with a keyboard and mouse, but if that suits you, by all means do so.Targeting remains a bit tricky, and you can’t always be sure that you will hit what you’re aiming for, but it is something you can work around. From time to time, you might find yourself changing your viewpoint and inadvertently targeting something else, oops!Graphics: Assassin’s Creed has been known to focus a lot of attention on their atmosphere, so it is only fitting that the graphics are as polished as they are. This game offers beautiful and breathtaking sights, and paints them in a realistic light. It is really hard to criticize this aspect of the game, because they did such an amazing job with fine-tuning the scenery to fit their setting. I absolutely love how the game looks and feels, and I’m pretty sure you will too.Sound: The music is beautiful, and the voice tracks are considerably less annoying than its predecessor. The combination of assassinating a target to the score of dramatic music can only be described as a rewarding experience. Though it should be noted that the entirely optional use of subtitles will help with translating the incorporated use of the Italian language. Overall the sounds contribute immensely to the games atmosphere, which is something that I will likely continuously praise in this particular franchise.Replay Value: Assassin’s Creed II is among my favourites in the series, thus far, and I would definitely recommend a replay at some point. Then again, replay value is entirely dependent on the person playing the game.			"

 Disclaimer: I would like to thank the random kind stranger who has given me this game as a gift.  Plot  – If you haven’t  played the previous game yet, like I did, you’ll probably be confused on what is happening during the first part of this game. But even so, the writers did a great job of giving out stories about the happenings during the previous game, giving you at least an explanation on what is going on.  Similar to first one, you will still play as Desmond Miles. But instead of tracing back to Altair, you will relive the life of Ezio Auditore, a Florentine nobleman during the Renaissance period. You will discover your father’s secret and join the Assassin Order to help them end their feud against the Templars and finally achieve true peace.The game is long enough for you to be satisfied, as I’ve poured more than 20 hours to finish the story. Even though it may sound generic to some, but I assure you that this will leave you pleased as this is one of the greatest stories told in the franchise. Environment and Design  –  It is exactly how the Renaissance was pictured in the paintings we can see on museums. The game also boasts the popular and fictional landmarks that are found in different parts of the map. Other than the resemblance, most of them were also a big part of the main story. And this is a great way for players to learn about these historical places.The cities have the golden yellow effect, though it is probably just the sun, giving it the nostalgic effect. With five different maps that you can go to, you’ll have a huge sandbox to roam and play on. Thus, they’ve included fast travel stations for you to switch into different maps trouble-free. And this will come handy as you progress towards the game when you start jumping into different maps or going back and forth to your own villa. In this, you can manage the infrastructures to be built and a chance to increase your income.  Gameplay  – Even though the game is about being on stealth to pick off unguarded enemies, parkouring from different rooftops to get to your objective, it also offer an impressive close combat fights. Even though there are times that the game doesn’t give you choices on how you want to assassinate a target, it is still satisfying task to do. If ever you’re in help, there are three different factions that you can rely on. Obstacle course or puzzles can also be found in-game, even though they aren’t that easy they are also not that too hard. But in fact, during the start of each puzzle, the camera will give you an idea on how to complete the course. For a game during its time, these features are awesome and very satisfying. Controls  - I had trouble playing the game for the first time, I even had some trouble towards the end. First, the buttons shown in HUD aren't clear. I had to check the controls in the options just to see what keys to press to do a specific action. I didn't know how to sprint not until I finished the first fight of Ezio. And I'm a little impatient person, and the game punishes you for that. Specially during free running, I tend to hold down the Spacebar, even if I don't really have to, resulting for me to fall down. Conclusion  - If you haven't tried any Assassin's Creed game before, just like me, I recommend that you either start with this or the first game. Whichever, you can assure that you will have a great time on finishing them. And for me, this is one of the best story this franchise has. Since this game requires Uplay in order to be played, I suggest that you turn off the cloud synchronization as it may result your save file to be corrupted on accidental shutdowns.Thank you for your time reading this review that I made. And I would highly appreciate it if you can rate it to your liking. Below are the links for my other reviews that would complete this story arc.Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood - ReviewAssassin's Creed: Revelations - Review "

												I'll start out by saying that this game is an improvement in every way over Assassin's Creed. The main improvement is it's NOT repetitive. There are many more mission types. The cities are so much bigger and more vibrant. There is an economy where you can earn money and spend it on upgrades. The people are more interesting and real, including Ezio himself. The sounds of battle and cities are as real as they can be.Your hero in Assasin's Creed 2 is Ezio Auditore, a young Italian noble. Ezio's sort of cross between Nathan Drake, Casanova, and Batman. The story (ignoring the bits outside the Animus) is a great revenge-conspiracy plot set through over 20 years of Ezio's life. While I won't pretend all the character's are memorable, they're all played with personality and wit and the voice actors never strike a false note (you can even switch to playing the game in Italian with english subtitles!).The gameplay is also MUCH more fun and more varied than AC1. Gone are the investigation bits of an assasination but added are more story-based, action-packed missions for you to work through up to your assassinations. These, again are VERY fun and each mission you go on feels completely unique to the one before it. Even the optional assassinations have more rules and complexities as you work through them.Also, it easily has one of the best soundtrack! The music is not only original and cool, it changes perfectly to match the action in the game (chase scenes, flying, hiding etc). The developers really went out of their way with this one.This remains one of my favorite series of all time and I highly recommend it to all gamers. You might even learn a little italian too. xD

												In short: the best game i've played up to now; basta! This is a real love baby from Ubisoft: you can see and feel all the effort that is put into designing en developing the story and gameplay.Not only lots of action, but also very educational too. The story evolves in Renaissance Italy and is based on real cities, buildings, persons and historical events. All important buldings and persons are in the database of the game with all details about architecture and what a person achieved or did. Very interesting and very, very well done.Lately i was watching the Giro d'Italia and the buildings/roofings/cathedrals were exactly like in ACII!There's tons of side missions, an open world, beautiful graphics, great voice acting, great drama and violant fights. This game can be placed in several categories, not only action. You ride horses, fly in Leonardo da Vinci's plain, sail boats etc.This game is for me a 9 out of 10: too bad there are some bugs towards the end that affect gameplay.Still this game is a must have; it's brilliant. Go get it.This is an addendum 2 years later. I've played several new games the last 2 years, but still ACII is one of the best i've ever played.			"

												Ubisoft Montreal left plenty of room to build upon the core concept established in Assassin’s Creed, developing their burgeoning modern day story of Desmond, a test subject who is made to regress back in time to former lives through the Animus. Assassin’s Creed II begins where the last game left off, with Desmond still confined to the Abstergo laboratories, staring at a wall of indecipherable code.After a hasty escape from Abstergo with Lucy in tow, it’s not long before you’re willingly lying back on an upgraded Animus, ready to delve into the life and times of yet another assassin. The assassin in question is Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young nobleman living in Renaissance Italy amid great political turmoil, brutal violence and emerging transcendent art.Unfolding over thirty years, Ezio’s story is far greater in scope, seeing the young petulant noble suffer through family tragedy, taking him on an epic quest for vengeance as he adopts his father’s mantle of master assassin. While the transformation from immature teen to super assassin seems awfully quick and more than a little unconvincing, there’s no disputing how much more fluid and satisfying to control Ezio is when compared to his medieval predecessor, Altair. Your protagonist isn’t the only aspect of Assassin’s Creed II to be expanded since the previous game though – every single facet of the game has been enhanced to an astonishing degree, far exceeding our expectations by a considerable margin. Not only have the fundamental mechanics been refined, making ACII a more pleasurable experience than the first game, but the sheer depth, breadth and variety of activities on offer is utterly staggering.Renaissance Italy itself is a glory to behold – a stark contrast to AC1’s cold grey and blue alleyways – Assassin’s Creed II’s regions are liberally draped in a startling palette of warm, sun-kissed hues all rendered in intricate detail.ACII’s Italy is not only home to Ezio’s story-led missions, but a host of other distractions, like courier deliveries, races, viewpoints and non-story related assassination contracts. Item collection still features heavily, but is nothing like the 400 or so flags you had to gather in the first game.Still the crux of the game remains in the assassinations and with the array of weapons and new combat opportunities available to you, the number of methods you can utilise to dispatch your targets is massively increased. Abilities such as aerial assassinations, ledge kills, poison blades and more give you a greater variety of options, some of which are unashamedly cool.Assassin’s Creed II is something altogether unique in its uninhibited size and wealth of ambition, few games managing to measure up in terms of depth and detail. Boasting a suitably grand soundtrack, majestic aesthetics and masterful level design, Assassin’s Creed II is everything you could have ever wished for and so much more. Overall 9/10.			"

												The first thing that should be said is Assassins Creed 2 is a major upgrade over the original game, the game actually plays a lot more like a Sandbox game than the original.   A whole bunch of new tricks have been added to help you live our your fantasies of being an assassin.  Some sorely needed tricks missing from the original game was the double execution, and the double jump while climbing.  Also the you can loot fallen enemies for money and an occasional refilling of your consumables.  You can now buy upgrades to your armor, which improve your fighting ability.  Another new addition to the game is new weapons, no longer stuck using predetermined weapons assigned by how far in the game you've gotten.  If you want to use a mace... have at it.. want to use a sword... you're golden pony boy..  Feeling like a two hander..  find your locale guard and slay him..  You can now roll around like the executioner.  Chopping and Slopping all over town..The story..  You return as Desmond Miles, a man captured by Abstergo Industries and forced to relive the memories of his ancestors.  Easy enough...  except the fact Abstergo plans to use Desmond until he's no longer viable..  (ok that's totally not cool)..  All is not lost as the first mission in the game sees Demond escape the clutches of Abstergo with the help of the sexy and talented Lucy.  He escapes from the comfortable confines of Abstergo industries to the truck of a car...   Meeting with a group of assassins who want Desmond to go back into the Animus so they can stop Abstergo.. (Wait I thought he was rescued so he didn't have to go back into the Animus... umm alrighty then)  This time around you step into the shoes of Enzio Auditore, a playboy, slacker, layabout... Although he's the son of a wealthy banker in the 1500's so what else would you expect from him.   After a major betrayal (I won't spoil it) he goes off to do what anyone would do when they are betrayed, get revenge by killing anyone involved.    The rest of the story is your typical, kill this person, rescue this person, kiss that person, while along the way building up your Uncles home town.  As a side note I personally found the Enzio story to be far more interesting than the one presented in the original game for Altaire. Gameplay..  The game play moves away from the repetitive nature of the first game.  Where the first game required you to fulfill 3 our of 6 events to unlock an assassination, this game abandoned that in favor of a more or less story driven progression system.  Now you do story missions to push forward the game.  Plenty of stuff aside from story missions exist, such as Assassination contract, races, fighting events.  Aside from those events the game also has collectibles, gone are the flags and  in their place you have Feathers, View Points, Weapons and Armors.  New execution and climbing animations have been added...  No more killing enemies one at a time with the double execution..   You also have an upgrade-able base, and the inclusion of money, which has some effects early on in the game, but about the mid way point you'll have far more money then you could ever spend, so don't fret too much if you're only pushing a few thousand after a few hours...  Once you get your city upgraded a decent bit you'll start pulling in money hand over foot.Combat..  Numerous changes to combat made AC 2 seem like a totally different game.  Double executions, no more regenerating health bars (you'll need medicine to heal yourself this time around), the AI has improved slightly, no more sitting and waiting to counter attack, this time around you can button mash provided you have decent enough reflexes to counter attack enemies.  A few new tools added to the arsenal as well..   You now find yourself with a (very limited) pistol, and what good assassin would be caught dead without a smoke ball (perfect for killing high ranking officials... or getting caught with your much larger best friends wife).  Old classics like throwing knifes make a return but they are almost as limited as the pistol in terms of usefulness. I'll recommend Assassin Creed 2, compared to the first game, AC 2 is like night and day, for being one of the earliest entries into a fairly long series I would personally say it's held out quite nicely in almost every category that matters.  So when asking yourself if you should buy AC 2, I'll leave you with a single question..  Do you enjoy fun video games?  If you answered yes!!! Then by all means buy AC 2 and let your inner killer out..  just remember no shame exist in throwing pesky archers off high rooftops..  It can be the most fun you've ever had :-)			"

												If you your thinking of buying this game. Let me tell you, this game will put you under the hood of the one of gamings best protaganists. The name ""Ezio Auditore Da Firenze"" is one you will never forget. I must warn you though, that this is a 3 parter game, starting with the begining in ACII, then AC Brotherhood, and lastly the conclusion in AC Revelations. so plan to get all 3 on sale if you can, and prepare for the ride of your gaming life.(Xbox controller is highly reccomended)                                              on average i give this trilogy a 8/10			"

												This is definitely one of the best games in the Assassin's Creed series and an absolute classic. The gameplay has aged decently. Combat isn't as good as later entries and at times Ezio seems to jump in a completely different direction to what you wanted, but overall it's a fairly solid experience. The story is the strongest point here, and the protagonist, Ezio Auditorie, is arguably the best in the entire series. The events of the game take place starting from his birth until he is about 40 years old, and you will notice him mature greatly as the story progresses. There's also a lot of different cities and areas to explore, my personal favourite being Venice.Try to get the game in a sale if you can, but I strongly recommend this to anyone who wants to get into or already likes Assassin's Creed.

												I told myself i would buy this game. even tho i got rid of it on my 360. i preordred it in 2009 and got the black ezio ediiton. i still have the statue in the box. but not the game. and i saw it on steam and put it on my wishlist. so today was finnaly the day i got around to playing again, after not able to play the game for nearly 3 years, when i first got the game i was into it so so much. i wasted my whole life on it. because of how the game was created how the story was. how everything  was detailed. Free RoamOpen WorldA story of a child who grows up to be an assassinHow it has such amazing character designsThe graphic was good when the game first came out. but now you compare to other creed games, it's not that great. but it's still an enjoyable game.The game has many weapons and armors to buy. Maybe some parts of the game are repeative, eg looting, same combat, but you learn more combats as you pogress through the story, but it's still enjoyable until you finish the game. It's one of the best assassin's creed game created, i don't care if you think i'm wrong or not this is my own review and opinion.The game is set in italy and you get to travel almost the major city of italy.You can pickpocket!!But i know this doesn't says much about the game, it's just what i'v experienced playing over maybe 1000+ hours on the 360, it's one of the best assassin's creed game! and i recommend it to everyone who loves free roam, open world with amazing set in old days countryside, city and it has such amazing music aswell!

												Assassin's Creed 2 is an action-adventure stealth game with open world environment from Ubisoft. Assassin's Creed 2 is a sequel to the previous game Assassin's Creed.Desmond Miles was about to be executed but were saved due to the intervention by Lucy Stillman. It appears that Lucy is an assassin in disguise. She helps Desmond escape Abstergo. After some rough journey, Desmond finally reach the assassin's hideout. There he meet Rebecca and Shaun. Desmond needs to learn how to become a real assassin. So there he goes again, into the Animus. This time, Desmond will relive the life of Ezio Auditore, an Italian Nobleman.The gameplay then. Ubisoft really learned their mistake this time I think, and not just that, the gameplay aren't just no longer repetitive, but really expanded. You can now earn money and buy weapons and upgrades to improve yourself. You're going to pickpocket letters no longer, but you're going to steal money instead. Notoriety system are now included, which mean, the more bad things you do, it will get you wanted and will make the guards aware of your present and at some notoriety level, will attack you on sight. You can also now hire a thief or some mercenary to help you do some task or distract the guards. Ezio can now swim in water.The graphics are also improved. Ragdoll physics are even better than the previous and the Italian environment are really much detailed and feels more alive. The water effects, the skies, the textures, the lightning, everything is better. The animation may look pretty much the same with the previous game, but with better physics.This may be the best Assassin's Creed game yet. The game is very stable, giving you much freedom while the story still quite linear. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

 Introduction Assassin's Creed II, takes place during the height of the Renaissance in Italy.You play as Ezio Auditore da Firenze, the Assassin on a quest for vengeance against those responsible for betraying his family.The second title in the franchise, adds many features to the game. This includes the Hidden Gun, the ability to swim, and many refines to combat. Categories GameplayCombatStoryGraphicsOptimizationBugsPersonal ExperienceProsConsConclusion Gameplay Assassin's Creed II favors stealth over full-on combat.You can run, ride horses, swim, or use paddle boats to get to your destination.Parkour has been improved from the first game, which allows for smoother and faster movement. Combat The combat in this edition of Assassin's Creed, has been improved from it's predecessor, becoming more fluent with appreciated changes.Being able to use the Hidden Gun, will bring a whole new advancement to the game's combat.You can now purchase armor and weapons, which will increase health and change Ezio's appearance. Story As stated above, you play as Ezio Auditore da Firenze.He starts off the game young and reckless, until his family is hung because of templars wanting to take control. Before his father dies, he learns that his father was an Assassin. Ezio goes to collect his fathers gear and flees the city with his mother and sister to the safety of his uncle Mario's villa in the countryside. As he assassinates his targets, he identifies the mastermind of the plot: the Spaniard Rodrigo Borgia. Graphics Considering the game was released in 2009, it doesn't have the best graphics.Colors are quite bland, shadows are horrible, and render distance is short.With a SweetFX patch, and with 4k DSR 60fps, the game doesn't look that bad. Optimization Optimization is quite poor in this game.Frame rate will jump around a lot, no matter the settings you use. Bugs Enemies will attack you even when you block them.Bad performance. Personal Experience Beginning of the game is rather boring, and didn't interest me all that much. Once I got to the middle of the game, I really liked it and was really interested.Performance wise, I was playing on a GTX 980 ti OC with everything maxed out at 4k. I could manage 60fps, though it was keep dipping from 60 to around 45 because of bad optimizaion.The game was a great improvement from the first game. Pros Interesting story.Loveable main character.Great landmarks. Cons Poor performance.Micro-stutters.Bland coloring. Conclusion Great improvement over the first game, and gets interesting once you're through half of the game.I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in the Assassin's Creed franchise.

												As a guy that doesn't have a console to play these kinds of games on, I very much like the fact that Ubisoft modified this game so that it was playable.  Also this game taught me more about Renaissance Italy and its important figures in history than any of my history classes did.  Pros:- Good storyline and character development- I play this on my laptop; it doesn't run with very much lag a lot of the time- An enjoyable open-world atmosphere- Stealth is a challenge (Ezio would be a better ninja than some...)Cons:- The pc controls are strange and difficult to get used to.- Sometimes the audio glitches out.- The uplay launcher thing has been a bit of an issue, so I've seen.  (I couldn't run it for a few months after I got it.  What you have to do is go to www.uplay.com and download the newest launcher, then you enter the product key and play, and it works fine [yes you will need an account].  The reason the uplay launcher you get by downloading it via steam doesn't work is not because of uplay; it's because steam hasn't updated it.  Therefore it's steam's fault that it's so broken.)			"

												I never understood why this game was so popular and I never understood why people said ""it's the best game in the series"" until I actually brought the game. And holy sh*t what a game this is. For a game that's about 6 years old, it's.... Its just fabulous and couldn't agree more with this being the best (Sorry black flag..) The beginning of the story (Ezios story, no one gives a sh*t about Desmond at this point) had this charm of 2 brothers just being brothers and not alot of the get straight into the action bullsh*t. :D)And for the rest of what I've played... very sad indeed. SPOILER:  Y'know, Ezio's dad and some other family members I forgot being killed and all? The soundtrack is very, very good. Some of the music like the famous ""Ezios family"" are an absolute masterpiece Scenery? From what I've seen, it's beautiful. To conclude, buy this game now			"

												It requires you to install UPlay which is an application that has to be on-line to let you play. By installing this product you are obliged to terms of service concerning player's privacy which I do not found to be acceptable for me.I will buy no more games from Ubisoft unless they drop their stupid DRM policy, which affects only legitimate users. I will save my money for other developers, who respect their customers, and I suggest you to do the same.			"

												The first Assassin's Creed was a joy to play. I stated in my review, though, that it felt like a disjointed collection of minigames.Assassin's Creed 2 (""AC2"") takes those individual game elements from the first Assassin's Creed, and remixes them to create a game that's far more entertaining.For this second game, the developers kept the stuff that works (climbing towers, free-running), and eliminated the things that were less fun (eavesdropping, picking pockets, long combat sequences). You're doing a better mix of stuff in AC2. There are several indoor locations in this game, and the addition of storefronts on the city streets makes these Italian cities feel much more alive than the dusty, beautiful, barren cities of the first game.AC2 offers a variety of things for completionists to work at. Weapons and armor to purchase, art to collect from city merchants, Investments to be made in the infrastructure and services of the city around your family's villa. Feathers to collect from high city ledges, and a conspiracy theory to unravel. So many things to do! Bopping between them is great fun.There are typical side-quests: assassinate so-and-so in service of your mentor, beat up someone's cheating husband, race through the city against a timer, deliver package from point A to point B. Yada yada yada. However, there are also a few exceptional sidequests in the guise of raiding underground tombs or Templar hideouts. These are masterful puzzles, in which you must make your way carefully through a maze of acrobatic leaps and climbs to obtain a special prize. This style of gameplay in AC2 is reminiscent of Mirror's Edge or Portal 2, in the way it challenges you to puzzle your way through an enclosed area that is reluctant to reveal its secrets. These special side quests each take about 45 minutes to complete. They were a high point of the game for me.I have two complaints. First, I would have preferred more stealth gameplay, and an option to complete the game without murdering hundreds of innocent city guards. Don't get me wrong; I found it very satisfying to pull an unsuspecting victim off a rampart and watch him fall to his death. But the body count is very high in this game, and the gratuitous murder sprees don't really mesh with the main character's “reluctant hero” personality. My other complaint with AC2 is its excessive length. The gameplay here is fun, but it doesn't change much over time. What you're doing in the 5th hour is very similar to what you're doing in the 30th hour. I spent over 40 hours in this game, and I was hoping for a finale after 20. This is a rare example of a game where too much of a good thing makes the overall experience less pleasurable, less memorable.But don't let that stop you from playing. AC2 is frequently on sale for $5, and I can't think of many games that deliver better entertainment at any price. "

												I realize that I'm late to the party. Assassin's Creed 2 is an amazing game. You want to be a mideval Batman, this game is the game for you. I'm sure you've seen other review praise this game as well, They are all true. I do want to point out a few issues. The controls are screwed up for game pad controllers. There are fixes to remap the buttons but its pretty sad they you have to hunt down a hack to fixed what should be fixed in game. Also during close quaters combat, often you will be fighting the camera as much as the characters. Still, its a must play game.			"

												An improvement compared to the first game of the series, also bigger game. Beautiful sceneries, captivating characters, immersive story and good soundtrack. You can explore, free roam, do the main story missions and optional missions, grab collectibles, almost in any order. There are items upgrades, new weapons, and skills. Many places to go and exploration to do. The Deluxe Edition includes 3 bonus areas, that are not important for the main story but provide additional game time if you had not enough exploration already. This game is worth to be played, even if you are new to the series, this is a good start. This game kept me entertained for more than 40 hours. "

												At first I didn't pay much mind to Assassin's Creed. Big mistake. When I was gifted this game I felt like it would probably not be the best game. I was wrong on the highest level possible. If you're not playing Assassin's Creed, you're missing out. The fighting is more than just beat-em-up style. You can counter attacks and instantly kill enemies. You assassinate high-up people responsible for a conspiracy behind the death of your father, and brothers. You even have a pistol later on in the game! Plus, you get to kill a corrupt politician with the title of ""doge."" That's another bonus to people tired of that twelvie may may. To cut the story short:>desmond gets in animus to remember a second assassin named ezio>ezio is 17 year old boy>ezio's daddy and little + big brothers get arrested>fat guy friend of ezio's family volunteers to take care of him>fat guy says he'll free his family>fat guy is actually mean politician aristocraty dood>fat guy has daddy and brothers execooted>ezio gets mad and sad>ezio keels fat guy>ezio gets trained by his uncle mario>ezio keels off the rest of the conspirator connection over a 10 year period>ezio beats the leader in a fist fight and leaves him to rot in a vault, followed by meeting a goddess>ezio gets the leader's staff of godly power>ezio gets called desmond by the goddess cuz desmond is in a chamber thingymajikker to remember ezio's life>ezio gets socially anxious from unanswered questions and goddess leaves him>desmond gets out of animus and beats up modern templar guards and chases the templar official but he escapes>the end			"

												Assassins Creed 2 was made close to two years after the original game. And it's really hard to describe it without going into what the game improved upon AC1.AC2 introduces a lot of things to make the world much more interesting. The sidequests are significantly more varied and dynamic. The guard AI more competantly follows the player and checks nearby hiding spots. The guards themselves come bearing different weapons and tactics to attack the player with. Assassinations can now be completed in several different ways. They added an economy to the world that not only allows you to customize your equipment and outfit but also utilize coins as a means of distraction. To top it all off general pathfinding and movement is a lot faster and more pleasant.AC2 in general is just a really pleasant sandbox game, and one that's worth playing for that. It's an effective mesh of well designed mechanics and polish, and there's little wonder why people consider it the best game in it's series.			"

												""Nothing is true, Everything is permitted.""Assassin's creed II is one of my most favorite games from this series and surely Ezio is one of best protagonists from entire gaming world.  Assassin’s Creed II is almost the opposite experience of Assassin’s Creed. It starts off looking and feeling like more of the same. This game is an improvement in every way over Assassin's Creed. The main improvement is it is not repetitive, There are many more mission types. The story of this game is strongest point here, and the protagonist, Ezio Auditorie, is definitely the best in the entire series.The cities of Italy are so much bigger in this game.This game is a true masterpiece and  must buy for AC lover :)			"

												Improves upon the classic Assassin's Creed gameplay. Good story, large map with different locations and lots of sidemissions. I also like the RPG elements like buying weapons or armor.It is not as repetetive as the first game, but it has some flaws. For example the fight system is fun, but it's still too easy. I should also mention, that this game uses Uplay. It can be annoying if uplay updates otherwise you hardly notice it.All in all you can have a lot of fun in this game, but if you look for a challenge you'll be disappointed.			"

												A NEARLY FLAWLESS AND MOST EPIC EXPERIENCE, INCHES CLOSE TO BE RUINED BY THE VERY DEFINITION OF DRM AS A BURDEN TO LEGAL USERS.After so many years I finally got around to play Assassin's Creed 2, from begining to end, I devoured the thing as if I had in my hands a classic of the golden era of gaming. Of course, it helped that my internet connection was down for a few days so it was just my and my backlog of games. While in the technical department it becomes obvious the game was held back by consoles, some texture pop in can be seen and the shadows, while full dynamic and very complete, they are also pretty low res, with no way at all of fixing both issues through configuration files. I really don't want to spoil it for those that still don't play it but suffice to say, the story kept my interest up all of the time, the missions being varied and enough side quests available to cover around 20-30 hours of pure content, with a few hours set aside to pick every single item available. Now, this UnotPlay thing, when I got my internet connection back, it decided not only to lock me out of accessing the Uplay specific unlocks for the game, it also removed every single Upay ""units"" I had. Uplay units are a kinda neat idea in that instead of mere achievements, you gain points to unlock additional game content. Be that media, wallpapers, songs, or actual ingame stuff. At least I used to think it was a good idea, because now I have no way of accessing that last side quest that you can unlock with UnotPlay points. So, my nearly flawless experience was somewhat spoiled by a totally unnecesary layer of DRM that is poorly maintainted by UBI. Even with that, I still fully recommend everybody to play this, and the entire Ezio Trilogy, if anything, so you can appreciate the decay in the direction the series was taken to, and also the terrible efficience with which UBIsoft ruins their IPs.

With the next Assassin's Creed coming this year (probably), I decided to play once again the game that put the Assassin's Creed franchise in it's highest success point.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Assassin's Creed II was released in 2010 for PC by Ubisoft Montreal (however, it was previously released in Q4 2009 for PS3/X360). Back when I first played it, I didn't know what to expect mainly because the first Assassin's Creed game was interesting, but very poorly executed, but since the media was giving so much praise, why not try it? What I found was one of what I consider the best games of the previous generation.Let's begin talking about the technical part - Assassin's Creed 2 isn't a perfect port, but it does work. The game don't appear to be very optimized to CPUs with more than 2 cores, and in scenes with lots of NPCs and things happening, I could feel that the game was running below 30FPS (of course I will let my PC specs later to give an idea), and I can't say that the graphics still good, they're acceptable, but most of time, if you take a more close look you will see that a lot of textures are in low resolution. Anyway, the game offer options to customize the graphics if you're running in a not so powerful machine, and from what I remember, it scalate pretty well in older systems. AC2 also supports up to 4K resolution, but it's capped at 60FPS. Now, about the story. It will be hard, but let me try do it in the more fast and understandable way:Back in the crusades, there was two factions fighting, the Assassin's and the Templars. Assassin's wanted to achieve peace for the mankind by giving people freedom, while templars wanted to control people with extremely powerful artifacts of an ancient civilization, because for them it was the only way to achieve peace and a perfect world. Things happened between that time and now (2010 - 2011), and those artifacts are now lost. However, a corporation called Abstergo Industries, that is controlled by Templars discovered a method to find those artifacts - they discovered that DNA hold your ancestors memories, and so, they developed Animus, a machine who could read these memories and also display them like a video. And then, they captured Desmond Miles, an Assassin that had escaped from his family and was living without any connection with them as a bartender.Things happened, we now retrieved his memories from Altair, an edgy assassin that was the main character of the first game and now, because of those things that happened, we're going to retrieve another guy past, but this time is not only for the info on the artifacts, but also to train Desmond - yes, with an updated Animus they could pass the skills of an ancestor to someone, not a direct transfer, of course, but during the sessions, Desmond will learn how to do things, like how to use a sword and hidden blade or how to go up high places and things like that. Anyway, during the game, we will not follow much of Desmond story, so we are going to now talk about it's ancestor that is also my favorite character in the entire series.Ezio Auditore da Firenze was a young italian guy from 15th century, doing young italian guy things, he had a happy family, two brothers, a father and mother, and one sister, but then pretty bad things happen and he need to get away from his house and city with his sister and mother, so he run away to his uncle Mario villa, and his plan was to stay there for sometime and then go away from all that. However, some other things happen, and he decide to help his uncle to fight against some bad guys. And then for some motive he decides to stay there with his family, and his uncle Mario tell him of the entire thing about Assassin's vs Templars, then he begin to do friends, like da Vinci, a girl with a dirty mouth, a elegant thieve and other interesting people. Then he go and begin to hunt down who made the bad things that made him run away in first place, and then he enter in the Assassin order, discover that his true enemy is now the Pope, and go hunt him too. Not in this exact order.Now, talking about the gameplay. During your gameplay, you will expend most of your time on Animus, since it's the main part of the game. You will be visiting Venice, Florence and Forli during the 15th - early 16th century. Initially, you will have open access of the parts of those cities that you have unlocked so far, and you unlock more parts of the cities doing story missions, but in free mode you can go search for treasures, do side missions or just explore the cities. You also have money that can be used to upgrade your sword and armor, however, the most powerful armor can be only adquired doing side missions, where you search for things to unlock Altair armor, in those side quests, you need to use your skills to go up in places, sometimes with a time limit, they're like puzzles based on skill. I didn't have much problems other than controls, and even then I didn't have to try more than 3 times to get at some place, other side missions include killing targets, beating unfaithful married men and important things like this. You also will have some collectibles like bird feathers and some Animus bugs left by the last guy who they used the machine. Those animus bugs unlock a video of Eve and Adam, those two from the bible, that on the game plot, rebeled against their creators, that are from the ancient civilization that created THAT artifacts and did bad things for them, and to unlock it's parts you need to found the bug, then solve it with a puzzle, that are like this one. This all I need to say about it, I think.Control wise, the game is pretty good, and I played with a keyboard and mouse setup. Playing with this may give you some problems to get up in some places or do some more advanced parkour, but it's not too bad. The combat is also fluid, but it kinda get repetitive in late game, unless you decide to be creative and use the entire arsenal that Ezio have - bombs, a pistol, poison that make people go around beating other people and then die and things like it. You don't need to, but it's cool and add some diversity than just kill people with swords.Now, about it's soundtrack, there's not much to say, it's just perfect. Composed by Jesper Kyd, it just add so much to the game, like this one while someone is pursuing you. It's so good.So, this is it. The Ezio story will go on in the two following games, Brotherhood and Revelations, and in a short movie that tell what happened with him after those two. tl;dr - flawed story, but engaging with one of the best characters created in last generation, not very well aged graphics mixed up with good controls and a awesome soundtrack in a world age not so explored in gaming with lots of things to do that may get repetitive compose Assassin's Creed II.REVIEW: 8.0/10			"

												Right out of the bat I'm going to say it... Assassin's Creed 2 manages to improve on (and in most cases) correct a lot of the 'mistakes' made in the first Assassin's Creed. The story flows more naturally, the environments are lively and invite you to explore... and there's no horrible 'hub' map that seemingly is just home to a horde of angry guards guarding pointless view point towers!Ezio as a character has more life and soul too, which only helps the story along. It allows you to easily get to know him and makes his pimping actions across Italy enjoyable. There's just something fun about running around the roof tops of Italy and generally acting like the biggest lad in all of Rome. I can't really explain it, but it's there - 'fun'.That was an element I felt was lacking in the first Assassin's Creed game where everything felt like a chore; a long drawn out chore with little reward. In Assassin's Creed 2 there are no 'chore' out moments to progress the game's content, the memory cores are all linked together and essential - so there's no climb a viewpoint, evesdrop on this guy and pluck a chicken style build up to Assassinations. Instead all story elements are told through memory segments, which allows the game to flow and the pace to build and fall in such a way that the game doesn't drain you emotionally or bore you to death. However, having said that I personally found Memory Block 12 & 13 to be totally out of place and to ruin the pace of the game. I found out that these 'chapters' were the added DLC, which would explain to the tacked on feel they had and the horrible pacing. All things considered looking back that was my only real issue with the game, which is amazing considering the mountain of issues I had against the first Assassin's Creed.Personal highlights for me were just the random events that would happen due to the Havoc/Ragdoll physics going a bit strange. Not in a terrible buggy kind of way, just natural mistakes happening such as people falling off buildings or running into each other. It was those natural unexpected events which caused me to laugh the most, it made the world feel alive. Also, I get some sort of sick enjoyment out of seeing Ragdoll death mechanics contort bodies... I'm not entirely sure why I've admitted that in written form, but there we go.I'll go seek help.The story was another bonus in Assassin's Creed II, as it expands on the strange historic, yet future pretense blend set in Assassin's Creed. Drawing influences from Templars and... Tron?! Well perhaps. There weren't too many Desmond scenes in this game, but the few you have are interesting and finally expand on his connection everything happening with Assassin's Creed.I don't want to say much more as it might spoil content, but I really enjoyed it and the ending... and the credits strangely enough. Overall, if you've been interested in Assassin's Creed but have been weary, I would recommend checking out an edited Youtube video of the Assassin's Creed cutscenes as a lead in towards actually playing Assassin's Creed II. The rest builds up and hooks in to Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood and Revelations.			"

												I know there were a great many complaints about the first Assassin's Creed game, and they're mostly well warranted. I, however, had a great experience with the game. The wonder of playing an open world game set in an historical era was such a mind-blowing experience that I found it easy to look past the repetition, the janky climbing mechanics, and the various other problems the game shipped with. Honestly, new IPs as ambitious as the first Assassin's Creed game deserve a little leeway anyhow, since they're attempting to accomplish so much while starting from scratch. Nevertheless, the game was severely flawed, and it rightfully got some flak for it.Assassin's Creed II, when it released, was a perfect example of why the medium of video games is filled with successful sequels. It's difficult for a studio to nail everything in their first try when, many times, they're starting from the ground up by building things like graphics and physics engines from scratch. So much time focused on the building blocks of a game leaves little time to flesh out the more dynamic aspects on top of those, which is why the first game featured so much reptition. Assassin's Creed II, however, improves upon everything that the first game promised. The graphics were superb at the time they released. There were literally no other open world games that looked this good, and they even stand up pretty well today. The cities were beautiful, they were alive. Florence is not a city that's changed much, and they completely nailed the feel of what I imagine it would be like at the turn of the 15th century. Platforming is improved, it's quicker, and it's more intuitive, but it's unfortunately not fully polished in this effort. When it works, it's improved massively over the previous game. The campaign itself is a meaty, lengthy game that's packed with content. You're visiting multiple cities here, you're visiting the beautiful Tuscan countryside, and the game is spanning decades. As somebody who's visited most of the areas depicted in this game, I can confidently say they've nailed the feel of the entire region. Ezio as a character is interesting, he's charismatic. He's an easy guy to root for, and his story begins personally and eventually emerges into a grand scale. He's been dealt a raw deal, but he lets things slide in a way that feels simultaneously incredible and admirable. Combat and player management has been expanded upon from the first game as well, as armor management, weapon and gadget management, and new costumes are all greatly designed. Customizing your Ezio is one of the most satisfying parts of the game. Combat is built upon from the first game, and now feels far more in depth. Probably the single best mechanic in the game is the build-your-own-stronghold aspect with Ezio's family villa. It's very addictive, and the visual change you experience in the small city is one that's immensely satisfying. As you invest money in building up your walled city, the population increases, the streets are cleaner and brighter, and the city is louder and more bustling as a result. I didn't realize quite how much it changed until I began a new game and saw how murky and depressing the place was when you first arrive there.One specific thing I'd like to highlight here and really stress is just how good the soundtrack of this game is. It's been mentioned before but I haven't seen anybody truly do it justice, yet. Jesper Kyd absolutely kills it, and sets the bar so highly here that he can't hit the same heights of quality in AC: Brotherhood or AC: Revelations. The music all fits the settings so superbly that I really can't imagine playing this game without it. Half of the reason the world is so immersive is the setting, the ambient nose, the lighting, and the architecture. The other half is all soundtrack. No exaggeration. The music is all ambient, and very low-key, but it flows like a satin ribbon, enveloping your brain and keeping you floating through the streets like you're walking on air. It's just so effective at immersing you into Ezio's world. It breathes life into an already beautiful world, and Kyd's dismissal as the series composer is a big part of the reason why Assassin's Creed III seems dead and less alive to me. The Florence theme in particular is utterly spectacular.This game, though, is certainly not without its flaws. Free running control has aged poorly since 2009 and can be frustrating at times, especially when attempting to move quickly. This makes any races and chase sequences an annoyance at best, and downright infuriating at worst. Ezio simply doesn't always go where you want him to, and story mission chase sequences are often purely trial and error as a result. Most frustrating would have to be Ezio's tendency to inexplicably stop when scaling straight up a building, and look the left at nothing in particular. This happening during a chase is especially frustrating. At times the camera is a massive pain during combat sequences, getting stuck behind buildings and spires. I also had an issue with the lack of a quick checkpoint restart option and fewer and further between checkpoints. It makes the light stealth gameplay here a frustrating experience at times.To put it with as much brevity as possible: This game is an experience. It's a thoroughly atmospheric, immersive delight that will transport you straight into this time period and make you want to do nothing but walk the streets of Florence and pole through the canals of Venice for hours on end, with no goal in mind more than collecting a few treasure boxes, seeing the sights, and listening to Jesper Kyd's wonderful score.

												Amazing. It's hard to find words that describe how brilliant this game is. I played ACII with little knowledge of the first game, but luckily it was easy to follow and it's well crafted. I can see why Ezio is a fan favorite, as his story is intriguing since he was just a troublemaker and womanizer who loves his family, when sudden and unexpected events lead him to becoming the famous assassin he is known to be in the AC universe. There are a lot of pros to the game, but to save on time I'll list the most important pros in my opinion.Pros:-Amazing story-Beautiful soundtrack-Outstanding graphics and scenery-Good voice acting-Great stealth system (blending in with crowds, sitting on a bench to seem normal, hiding in haystacks, etc.)-The leap of faith is always fun to do-Has a lot of content (my hours can prove that)-Each location is different and fun to explore-People react to you when you do something that isn't normal (such as killing a guard, stealing money, or aggresively shoving an NPC out of the way) adding to the realistic enviroment.-The guards are smart (but not too smart); if they see you tearing down a wanted poster,  going into a restricted area,  looting someone, etc, they will be suspicious and might attack.-Little, if any, bugs.Cons:-Ubisoft's trend of stopping pirating by having the game be permenently online can be a pain, especially if your WiFi tends to go out often.-Controls on a keyboard are a bit sloppy and it took a little bit to get used to.-QTE during cut scenes can be annoying  I missed the cue to hug Leonardo and it still haunts me -The NPCs that always serenades Ezio are annoying and tend to show up at the worst times.Although I have a lot of games I enjoy and recommend to friends, Assassin's Creed 2 has to be one of my favorite games of all time. It's a great, unique story with dynamic characters and fun gameplay and it's evident that a lot of time and effort was put into making this game. It's rare to find a game this involving and intriguing that has hours of content and is compatable on both PC and Mac. Definatly a must play for any gamer.			"

												This is where I started playing the Assassin's Creed franchise and I fell in love with this game. Although a few yeas old the graphics are still pretty impressive. This is probably the best Assassin's Creed game. It implements puzzles and killing. Pretty weird combination but they perfected it.

Awesome storylineOne of my friends is a huge fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise and he made me buy the game during Steam Summer sale and play it. And I've to say, I'm glad he made me do it.The story was awesome. Kept me hooked for 50hrs - That says something. And the ending was really amazing! Totally worth the 50hrs.What really impressed me is how they've tried to blend historical and biblical events in the story and puzzles. (Also, some greek legends.)Reminds me of Dan Brown books. Especially the glyphs. Many times while solving the glyphs I felt I would've appreciated them more if I had more knowlegde about the mentioned events.But that didn't affect the overall gameplay experience though. Since the glyphs is just an optional side mission. Which unlocks 'The Truth' - which again, took me by surprise :)PS. I've already decided to buy 'Brotherhood' and 'Revelations' this winter sale.

												AssassinsCreed 2 is a game full of content being story , side missions , etc but its immense share of design flaws makes it feel inferior to its console counterparts. Dont get me wrong but-AC2 on PC graphics wise is through the roof when it comes to its console counterparts.The story is far better than AC3(for sure) & brotherhood.The beautiful recreations of some of the most beautiful cities in the world and their landmarks make you feel like visiting them in real life.Plenty of sidemissions.Ezio as a character is more relatable then all those silent protagonists that we see in games all around.Each assassination feels fresh and new(not like in AC1 if you know what im saying).You define how your target will die and you can roleplay it and be an assassin(in your virtual life)But(like i said) where there a good there a ugly side-Some parkour sections feel like they were designed for joystick instead of Keyboard and mouse.The keys that shows you what actions you do are nothing but cryptic images appearing in your HUD. You hv to go in control section and figure out each one of them.Unlike consoles you cant map your weapons according to your prefference.Either way i give this game a solid A .			"

												Such and Amazing game, I mean AMAZINGGGGGG.First things first, it felt so good running around with the ambient music, it totally gave life to the diferrent cities. Everytime you came back to a city to do something you feel a strong noastalgic feeling, even if only 30 minutes passed. 9/10 Soundtrack.I don't usually complete the entire it of the game, sidequests I will most likely leave them undone but the main story, ohhhh ohhh that is such a golden point of the game. Just gold, its intense and combined with the beautiful scenery and music your gonna call sick to work the next day. Well I don't have that option but it was 3 days, sleeping,  working, playing, eating something in between to keep yourself alive and playing again.Ezio and desmond are such a good characters for you to follow along, that makes the game be worth it.That ending, that twist, that feeling it leaves you ""I need moreeeeeeeee"".

												*Edit: Finally succeeded to play and the port on PC/Mac is a mess for gameplay! Ubisoft is clearly great at level design but gameplay is another thing. Sure you have sweet moves sometimes but when it clearly matters to achieve a mission, you can't get it right. It's impossible to enjoy the combat system because it's sloppy and you'll cram your finger anywhere doing random stuff or just blocking like an invicible tank killing 8 guards surrounding you one by one.I GOT 99 PROBLEMS AND UPLAY IS ALL.I bought this game for 4,99$ and it is still a rip off. Can't launch the game after mutiple reinstalls. The reason: UPlay.UPlay is an ugly DRM monster and is the thing that makes Ubisoft a really lame publisher despite good games. I run Tomb Raider flawlessly but when it comes to AC2 (a 2009 game) that third party platform cause problems you can't even imagine.Prompts, crashes, rewards nobody cares about, slowdowns, unsaved sessions, account ban....***Avoid Ubisoft games at all cost on Steam***Here's my advice Ubisoft: why don't you just trust your customers and together we will kill UPlay!0/10 will torrent next time.

The game is pretty, has a pretty solid story, really excellent mechanics, and just improves on everything in the first one. Basically, this game is all that a sequal should be; it took the first game, kept the same concept, then improved everything. Really fun, and just really well executed.			"

												Fantastic game. Almost all the negative reviews come from people who can't connect to Uplay. I've personally never failed to connect to Uplay either in this or any other Ubisoft game, but I know some people have problems.One other thing: I definitely recommend playing with a controller because of the wacky keyboard controls; however, there are two files you have to download and paste into the game to get it to work correctly.Other than those two potential issues, neither of which bothered me, it's an absolutely great game, right up there with Black Flag, maybe even better. There aren't nearly as many of Black Flag's infamous tail quests (which I wasn't particularly good at). Anyway, grab it on sale.			"

												I just played this for the first time and was compelled to keep on playing until I had collected and done everything. I never understood how Assassin's Creed was so popular after playing the first one and writing the whole series off, but now I get it! This game is a modern masterpiece and is probably the sole reason that they went on to make so many Assassin's Creed titles. You owe it to yourself to experience this game, if you haven't yet done so. The story and the world is compelling, the mechanics are fun, I spent hours just wandering the city, chasing thieves and assasinating soldiers, and the lore is fascinating. I can't wait to try out the other Assasin's Creed games!			"

												Assassin's Creed 2 actually changes quite alot from its predecessor. Instead of collecting information on your target because of the story, you assassinate your target as it is part of the story. And like last time, there is an amazing feeling about running away and hiding from countless gaurds on your tail right after a majestic assassination. Parkour in this is similar to the last with sweet Architecture to climb and run across, giving off a completely different vibe than the original. What's the best indicator that something is a sequel? Well the number 2 of course! Which is why you now have 2 hidden blades! Some combat animations are quite satisfying although i think its become quite easy and i still enjoy the slower paced clashes of the original with close ups of bringing down your enemies. Music has also seemed to be toned up this time around, and the mood just always feels right and nostalgic. Ezio isn't perfect, and that adds to the story, and I'll always enjoy Altair and the ancient middle eastern setting, But AC2 Is a blast with a ton of fantastic improvements and additions.			"

												What seems like a typical revenge plot quickly evolves into an epic story filled with conspiracy and betrayal. Join Ezio Auditore, everyone's favorite Italian from the Renaissance, as he spends two decades of his life uncovering and disrupting a very powerful man's plans of world domination, furthering the struggle between Assassins and Templars carried from the first entry in the franchise. Whether you like to run across the rooftops of 15th-century Florence and Venice, gallop through the beautiful Tuscany countryside or simply learn more about some of their most relevant landmarks, the world is very appealing, albeit rather poor with side content.If the original Assassin's Creed didn't quite captivate your interest, maybe this one will. Weapon and armor customization, rebuilding an entire villa, new methods of evading and assassinating guards, lack of repetitive main story missions. The only aspects I can defend from the first game are certain moments in its storyline and the enemy targets themselves, as they had a bigger philosophical impact on the player.Completionist Playthrough: 28 hours "

												I enjoyed this game immensely.  I played through the first title last year, and I enjoyed that one quite a lot as well, but every time I mentioned how much I enjoyed the first one, inevitably someone would retort, ""Yes, but have you played the second one?""  To be honest, I really didn't see where the second title in the series could be that much better than the first.  I had seen gameplay videos and everything seemed fairly same-y.  I get it now.  I still stand by the first game as being an enjoyable experience, but ACII winds up being an immersive experience.First and foremost the story in this game plays out on an epic scale.  The first game was great in that it introduced the concepts integral to the series, but this game meticulously crafts those set pieces into an epic tale of revenge, redemption and growth.  While Altair seemed a bit like a faceless soldier of the Assassin's Order, Ezio is a well rounded character with human strengths and flaws.  Over the course of 10 years Ezio experiences ultimate loss, and absolution through the Order and through his own personal quest.One of the things that's an amazing strength of this series is how it takes real historical people and places, and then interweaves them seamlessly into the mythology of the series.  ACII is astounding in this regard.  There is so much attention to detail that the entire game seems plausible, and further that you are witnessing a living breathing rendition of renaissance Italy and its colorful inhabitants.Another aspect where the game shines is in it's attention to detail in terms of intricate conspiracies, playing out over the course of centuries.  If you're a conspiracy buff, or a fan of works like The Da Vinci Code and Holy Blood, Holy Grail, you will likely find plenty to enjoy here.  There's just so much content to absorb regarding various political intrigues, and shady nefarious ""illuminati type"" groups manipulating world events behind the scenes.  It's a game that rewards you for digging deeply into its sizable database of people, locations, documents, decodable glyphs and various other errata.Naturally the the free running game play mechanics for which the series is famous for really shine here.  The other core element of the gameplay is of course assassination, and it feels and plays here better than ever.  For this outing Ezio sports two arm blades meaning that you can assassinate two targets simultaneously.  Add to that the various new and assorted deadly gizmos at his disposal (provided to Ezio vis a vis a very famous Italian renaissance painter and inventor), and he's an extremely formidable opponent.  In fact the game makes you feel like an absolute badass, regardless of whether you choose to take a stealth approach for minimum body count, or if you'd prefer hack and slash your way through the legions that oppose you (shock and awe!).  You are a walking razor blade, and no one will stand in your way between you and your target.  In regards to this latter point I should point out that the combat in this game has been improved significantly from that seen in the first game.  Ultimately the gameplay in ACII feels natural, smooth and exhilerating.  One element Ubisoft added to this game which really shines, is that you're tasked with raiding the tombs of various famous assassins.  These areas wear the Tomb Raider influence on their sleeves, but when you combine that with excellent freerunning mechanics, they are an absolute joy to play.  They're basically like a puzzle based free running mini game.  Awesome!One misstep present in the first game, that also rears its head here, is that the analog controls can be very touchy at times during freerunning and climbing segments.  I know I've raved about how good those sections are (and they really are), but sometimes Ezio will be in the middle of an epic freerunning line or several stories above the streets of Venice, when all of a sudden he'll freak out like an epileptic monkey on crack, and jump in a completely unexpected direction.  This will often spell disaster if you're high up off the ground or chasing after a fleeing target, and it can definitely lead to some rage inducing WTF moments.  All told though those moments are fleeting, and certainly didn't diminish my enjoyment of the game.I almost forgot to mention it, but the Super Mario Bros. reference at one point was pretty much one of the highlights of the game for me.  I won't spoil it, but you'll know it when you see it.  There's also a random pedestrian comment you hear occasionally regarding, ""a capering crusader"".  Ha!  Classic!All told I had a really good time with this one, and I can't wait to see where Ezio's adventures take him next in AC: Brotherhood (after a suitable cool down period of course.  Too much of a good thing is still too much).  My personal GOTY?  Maybe!			"

Go to: http://www.assassinscreedsavegames.com/savegames/Assassin%60s_Creed_II2. Download the save file you want.3. Replace your old save file with the newly downloaded save file.4. Launch the game and load the downloaded save file.I finished Assassin's Creed 2 and it's actually a really good game.

												First, DO NOT listen to the negative reviews for UPlay servers being down.  There are many threads explaining how to uninstall the UPlay launcher and then reinstalling a newer version.  Very easy to do.  Once you get to playing, you are pulled into a fantastic open world.  Almost everything in the game is extremely gratifying, and if you have not picked up this game, do it.  One other piece of advice is to use a controller while playing this game.  I am about a quarter of the way through the game, and I've been playing with a keyboard, but it's given me some trouble.  Other than that, do not hesitate to buy this game and enjoy!			"

												This is the pinnacle of Assassin's Creed. You start off with the new great (and charming) protagonist, Ezio Auditore. Because the protagonist is new, you can hop right in here and not lose too much information. The Story is amazing and keeps the game going at a good pace. The gameplay is very different from AC 1 (less repetative, , no more mandatory synchs) and the missions are very diverse. The atmosphere of the game is very special. Each location feels different and is easily recognizable. Combat is nice (normal ""arkham"" style), while not as good as Brotherhood, it still feels nice.The worst thing about this game is one of the final missions, where before you can continue  you must get all of the pieces of paper across the world. There is like 30 of them. And it gets tiring. Almost like the Triforce Quest in The Legend of Zelda: The Windwaker, but more repetitive and more pieces. If you want to try AC, get this one and nothing else.Pros-Great Story-Best AC Protagonist-Lots of Improvement over AC 1-Great Atmosphere-Huge Open World-Historical (But let's be honest, you're not going to read that♥♥♥♥♥♥Cons-uPlay-DLC is not worth it-It's not Skyrim filled with content-Lots of Filler-If not paced correctly, the ending is slowtldr: 10/10 would assassin again			"

 This is one of the best Assassin's Creed game.  Pros : - Long and interesting story-line.                - Good gameplay, nice graphics.                - Despite of it's age it is still a game up there.                - If you like the series you would not mind buying this.               - Runs perfectly on Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1 / 10    Cons : - Could be a little bit irritating while fighting.               - Much better with a controller, In my opinion.

												What a great game this was. I recommend AC2 to any gamer who enjoys a good story with a beautiful world to explore and stuff to collect.There is a lot of info about the locations in the game, and those locations are really accurately designed and that only adds to an already strong and original story. My friends told me this was the best AC game of the series so far and now i believe them.Plus, you can murder a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of people and get away with it #ThugLife9/10.			"

												Assassin's Creed 2 is a very nice improvement on Assassin's Creed 1 as the repetitive nature of the first game is replaced with more varible missons and far more tools to complete them. Such as gaining a second hidden blade to allow for 2 kills at once, the ability to posion one blade to made enimies infected go berserk and eventually die.  later in the game you will also unlock a pistol upgrade.  This game also came with a optional puzzle elements that you can do that builds on the lore of assassin's creed. As well as side objectives such as rebuilding a town that has been left in a state of disrepair. Buying paintings from art merchants to add to the villa of the town you are helping to rebuild which will also add a steady income for you to collect which will allow you to buy newer armour and equipment throughout the game.Finally the story builds on what happens with desmond in the modern era and the continued struggle with Assassins and Templers in the past. The story  is about desmond using the assassins animus 2.0 to relive the life of Ezio Auditore a 15th century noble who is on a quest of revenge agaisnt the ones that killed 3 member of his family.

												Assassin's Creed II, graphically improved and better control responses, is following up after the interesting journey of Altair, master assassin from the Third Crusade days.You return where you previously left off as Desmond, still imprisoned inside Abstargo's facility. However, not for long. Lucy returns and helps break you out, just to bring you to an apartment complex where you return to the Animus to discover more of Desmond's ancestors.Inside the animus you enter a time of Renaissance in Italy. Your journey starts through the eyes of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, a young man full of childish antics and testosterone. From here you live through the years of young Ezio as his world abruptly alters as he witnesses political turmoil and power struggles. This is obviously a sheer jist of what you will encounter.Pros:- Another promising story to enjoy.- Huge graphic improvements from the first game.- Combat feels more fluent and at times challenging when trying to counter.- Renaissance time, one of my favorite historical periods.- There is more to do, as in fortress upgrades, more side-quests, and gear purchasing. - The world is larger and vastly more beautiful in comparison to Assassin's Creed.- Ezio, though uninspiring at first, grows on you as you travel through ten years of his life.- Assassin attire does not disappoint.- Water doesn't kill you!- New weapons and armor customization.I personally recommend upgrading your fortress as soon as possible. It brings in some great cash every 20 minutes of game time. So if you need to step away for a bit, leave the game running.Cons:- Side-quests, as normal, can become tedious. However, they are not required to progress the story.- A few bugs still present, but not largely inconvenient as the first installment.- Parkour does feel more touchy with the environment.- I like the gondola, but steering it can get a tad annoying around smaller areas.Very little cons, I really enjoyed this game. I started it on a Friday night and completed the main story within the same weekend. So don't expect a 30+ hour story. This was a great upgrade from the first installment and witnessing some of Altairs legacy was also rewarding. This game will not disappoint and will definitely give you your moneys worth.			"

 Assassin's Creed 2 Retrospective Review Sort of...The Assassin’s Creed franchise is almost dead and buried at this point to some, but for me, a huge fan of the series, the franchises rest gives me a chance to go back and experience all the Assassin’s Creed games, before the eventual one to release next year in 2017. First, I started with Assassin’s Creed 2. I tried to get to part one, but for some reason it kept crashing every 15 minutes on my PC, and there was really nothing I could do that I didn’t already try. I do suggest however, that if you do go back to play the franchise, just stick with starting at AC2; AC1 is so far behind the technical curve of it’s sequels, that it feels like a PS1 era game compared to it’s contemporaries. Assassin’s Creed 2 is often lauded as the best in the series and for good reason. After the simplistic and formulaic repetitiveness of Assassin’s Creed 1. AC2’s diversity is a breath of fresh air. And diverse missions and combat mechanics are the name of the game  in AC 2. However, there are some outstanding issues that have occurred in AC2 while I was playing, that is probably due to just the age of the game itself. First, when it comes to story, it’s great! Ezio’s story is engaging and often keeps you emotionally hooked, but I do have to say that I feel as far as Assassin stories go, I think Ubisoft got better at telling an Assassin's story as the series went along. My only problem with the story in AC 2 is that it tends to be exposition heavy, but what I do appreciate is that it does have some time for heartfelt moments. The other little nag is that the story overall raises far more questions than it answers. It’s a shame since everything about the lore is incredibly intriguing, but for it’s mysteries to be revealed in such a piecemeal manner (which is actually something the series becomes notorious for doing as it goes along) it tends to leave more of a pain to want to know just what the hell is going on. At last the reveal that comes near the end, while exciting and probably opens the series for amazing opportunities (opportunities that have seemingly been squandered in the sequels) is not entirely satisfying. Now when it comes to graphics, the game is still a technical marvel. The environments and armors are so detailed that it makes them really feel real. Also another thing I’d like to bring up is the fact that people have started to complain recently that the series, in the more recent entries, has done all it can do to make it feel less like a real place and more like a game, but I’d quickly argue that AC2 feels like a game just as much as the others due to the fact that the Animus’ features cover up the screen in the same amount as the other later titles. Quickly, back to graphics, the game while still being beautiful in spots has terrible performance issues and some minor but irksome graphical glitches. When it comes to performance, it’s terrible across the board. Sometimes the game will drop below 60 to the 40’s for no apparent reason. I can output the game to 4k resolution and it still runs the same with the same inconsistent drops. It leads me to believe that it may be a CPU issue or something, but it is entirely annoying given that the game is pretty old. As for the graphical hitches, I fixed them with Nvidia Inspector which included better Anisotropic filtering, better VSync, and better anti-aliasing as all of the base features included in the game don’t work properly. The gameplay loop of Assassin’s Creed is a kind of all over the place, since Ezio at this point for the next two titles isn’t as nearly as fast or agile as his successors it usually takes a while to reach place to place. This is  helped by the game providing horses and some minute way of fast travel. The fast travel works only if you go to a different city so it’s kind of useless and the horses unfortunately are only useful for the country sides. The good thing is that the horses are fast and not slow. However, if you come up near objects and obstacles you can slow down considerably as the game’s parkour system desperately tries to determine whether your horse is jumping off a cliff or jumping over a fence even when faced in front of the fence. Now when it comes to collectibles, it can be enjoyable since they are really easy to collect and are often in near proximity of each other, which makes the act of collecting them all into an activity that lasts for about 5-6 hours. However I’m glad that a couple of the future titles opted for a “kicking the chest to open” mechanic that makes treasure collecting far less tedious. The feathers are another collectible that you can’t find in a considerable amount of time without a guide, but also provide and emotional side activity. The feathers in AC 2 actually have meaning as Ezio’s mother who stops talking won’t communicate with her family. Ezio collects these feathers in hope that his mother changes. It’s a nice hook that gives collecting the things more meaning, something that the future entries fail to do. The side missions are another part of the gameplay hook of Assassin’s Creed 2. They are enjoyable for the most part, but unfortunately ere on the side of repetitiveness a bit too soon, especially the assassination missions. In the main storyline the Assassination missions are quite diverse and unique, which set up a variety of ways to assassinate your foe, but the side missions which you collect from pigeon coops are not as consistent. There are some cool diverse situations, but unfortunately most of them turn into a simple run-to-this-location-and-then-assassinate-with-your-blade. Is it the best game in the franchise? Yes and no, for the most part I think most people have rose-tinted glasses on when they compare the supposed “♥♥♥♥♥iness” of the future sequels with the greatness of AC2. AC2 is great, but the future games in the series eventually surpassed it on a gameplay level, and arguably on a story level. The one game I think that definitely improved from a combination of the two is AC 4. On a technical level AC2’s controls just pale in comparison with the other games. Recently in AC:Unity I actually felt that for the first time being an assassin was an actual viable option. In AC2 being an assassin usually comes down to dumb luck, at least from my experience. The soldiers FOV for instance just varies greatly. Sometimes I would jog to them and assassinate without a fuss, but other times when I’d jog to them they would turn around instantly and detect me in which would at times turn into an automatic desync, which is incredibly annoying, as the game pulls the camera out and shakes violently  in a way that almost feels like if it’s telling you, “You lost!, Stop you lost okay, Just shut up, you lost! Restart your checkpoint, you incompetent assassin!.”  While in my head I’m thinking, F**k you game, F**k you. It’s pretty safe to say that the game’s controls aren’t the best nor is it’s AI consistent. Thankfully these things aren’t incredibly annoying as to deter you from playing, but your mileage may vary depending on what kind of games you play. When it comes to Assassin’s Creed 2, you can’t go wrong, you got a great story, detailed open-world, gameplay that is enjoyable, and a mythology to unravel. It may not be the best game in the franchise, but it’s pretty darn close. If you got $19 or better yet wait for a Steam sale, AC2 proves to still be an enjoyable experience that is still worth revisting.Some interesting points   I played about 75 hours    I got 100% synchronization    I unlocked The Truth    I also took too many screenshots    Also I played this game on an i7, GTX 970, Windows 8.1 computer  "

												This second entry in the series is much, much better than the first, but still ultimately mediocre. This will not be spoiler free, as the plots in these games are not worth anything so there is no value lost in spoiling them.This time, there are no frustrating, repetitive repeating missions, or bland cityspaces. No awful dialogue and no terrible sound quality.You will find here that, unlike the first, this game could be described as functional and playable for upwards of 10 minutes.Assassin's Creed II is, unlike it's predecessor, a working game. I will argue, however, that this alone does not make it a game worth playing.You will find an admittedly more compelling and engaging story here. We are told the story of Ezio, a young Italian noble enjoying his youth amidst family rivalries and conspiracy in Florence. Ezio's voice acting is leagues above Altair's awful, monotone American accent. You may notice Ubisoft's laziness in making Desmond's and Ezio's facial models exactly the same.Anyway, Ezio's family is betrayed by someone thought a friend and his father and brothers are executed.One of the stronger moments in the series in Ezio discovering his father's assassin robes, the track 'Earth' playing in the background, meant to evoke a feeling of discovery in the player and prompt you to appreciate Ezio's transformation.The soundtrack, composed by Jesper Kyd(who is excellent) is likely the strongest point of the game. The atmospheric tracks like 'Home in Florence', the story and character-development tracks like 'Ezio's Family' and 'Earth', and the chase tracks like 'Venice Rooftops' are all fantastic. It is music one can love consistently and appreciate for how it establishes and reinforces the setting of the world. One can quickly come to appreciate the detail and beauty of the game's depictions of Florence and Venice supported by the fantastic music.The story is centered around a convoluted web of conspiracy motivated by revenge and a desire to discover the truth. The larger sin of this game's story, one that many AC games are guilty of, is putting the player in situations where they could solve the central conflict of the plot nearly instantly.More than once, Ezio is tasked with eavesdropping upon the game's villains gathered in a particular location or walking around the streets, completely vulnerable. They do not possess advantages or knowledge that would stay Ezio's blade, it is just some notion of absurd tension-building that seems to have prompted the inclusion of these scenes.The supporting cast is mostly ridiculous. The Ezio saga seems to have this weird habit of insisting that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, mercenaries, and thieves are all delightful people misrepresented by those in power. I would guess that it is a way of emphasizing that Assassins believe in humanity/are optimistic about human nature while the Templars are not. Both groups, however, see objective truth/reality, religion, and ideology as illusions and lies, so neither group is inspirational or compelling in any way, no matter what any fanboy wants to claim. One can summarize the conflict as 'secular humanists who believe in humanity and thus advocate freedom' versus 'secular humanists who don't believe in humanity and thus advocate order'. It seems the more interesting discussion and debate happened off screen and our position on the matter has already been decided for us.Anyways, the 'supporting cast' are all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, thieves, and mercenaries. One tells us that prostitution really represents love and that she is doing God's work in running the brothel. Close of the end of the story, all of them jump out of the metaphorical bush and yell 'we were all secretly assassins guiding you the whole time, Ezio!' It's pretty poor writing. They then defeat the primary antagonist of the entire game and let him get away for no reason.The story, split into 14(really 12) sequences, skips years arbitrarily. My favorite moment is at the end of sequence 10, the game decides that the protagonist, with every reason in the world to pursue his enemies, sits on his♥♥♥♥♥for TEN YEARS in Venice, starting sequence 11 by lamenting that he'd been sitting on his♥♥♥♥♥like a ♥♥♥♥ing idiot for 10 years. Really odd stuff with the timeline like this really makes you wonder about Ezio's character and motivation.At the end of the game, you travel to Rome to assassinate the Pope -- the same character who could have died numerous times before by Ezio's hand. After stabbing him through the throat, his papal staff apparently allows him to..not die from that? Christ these games have terrible writing.Ezio wielding the 'Apple of Eden' and Rodrigo Borgia(Alexander VI) his papal staff, they duke it out, Rodrigo paralyzes Ezio momentarily, and takes the apple. Ezio now completely vulnerable, Rodrigo logically decides to not kill him and just hurt him a little bit because that always works out really great for the main antagonist in any movie, book, or game. Seriously this♥♥♥♥♥♥is terrible.After that, Ezio chases him down to the vault and challenges the 60-something year old to a fistfight, Rodrigo posessing a massive upper hand in possessing both artifacts, it naturally makes sense for him to give up every advantage and enter a fist-fight with someone superior in terms of muscle strength and fitness -- potentially losing all progress towards the goal he has been working towards for around 25 years or more. After defeating Rodrigo, Ezio, being emotionally mature and intelligent and developed, decides not to kill the antagonist responsible for all the death and misery that allowed for the plot in the first place. Ezio was totally willing to murder hundreds of guards who who more or less innocent and just doing their jobs, but when it comes to the person most at fault -- no, not having any of that. I'm going to let you live in an overly-dramatic, angsty move that illustrates just how stupid my character is.So yes, this game's plot and characters are atrocious -- but that's the case in nearly every game in this series, so this game is not any worse.This game is worth playing for the atmosphere and high amount of content. You can enjoy the various side missions like the assassination contracts, underground tombs, and collectibles, free from the pretentious characters and stupid story, but with all the atmosphere of the music and character of the city.Ultimately, as I said, the game is still mediocre when compared to games that are truly great, but the amount of content, soundtrack, and atmosphere make the game worth playing -- there is something to enjoy here, unlike the first.

												As a game?  Good.  As a product?  Crap.AC2 is a seemingly classic game brought down by technical issues, including slow start-ups, various crashes/freezes, poor optimization and uneven performance.If you insist on playing this version of AC2, I suggest the following:- When stability becomes an issue, commonly in later maps, reduce the CPU cores used to 2 for the AC2 process (details on how can be found here: http://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/480250-Assassins-Creed-2-crashing-hangs-lockup-Forums )- Avoid Alt-Tab'ing out, Steam's Shift-Tab, or any multitasking while the game is open- Don't bother with Steam Big PictureIssues will still occur, but the steps mentioned above seem to help.

												Assassin's Creed is the first game in the series that integrates the elements that made the whole saga so popular. After playing it's repetitive and disappointing predecessor, ACII was exactly the kind of experience that I was looking for. ACII involves all the elements of a great game: elaborate story, beautiful visual style, exploration, character development, action, fun side missions, rewards and smooth mechanics (which were not that smooth actually, but later about that). Deluxe Edition includes all the original DLCs, so there're hours and hours of gameplay. For few euros/bucks on sales or even full price I highly recommend purchasing this game, if you already haven't.PROS:- fascinating story line- collectibles, upgrades and secret areas – it's all integrated in the story line, which not only makes exploration and side missions meaningful, but also constitutes a sort of economical management microgame, as all your progress in terms of collectibles reflects on the value and features of Monterigioni Villa – Ezio's HQ- unlike its predecessor ACII actually feels like a stealth game and there are multiple strategies for approaching and assassinating your enemies- tons of content- opportunity to explore realistic virtual representations of some of the most famous cultural landmarks of Renaissance and to find out about their history- epic final battle- da Vinci's flying machineEssential improvements compared to AC1:-no annoying beggars and crazy people-no hordes of citizens-faster and more versatile battles-no repeating patterns in the storyline or sidemissions-more elaborate surroundings-more weapons-ability to hire factions for your advance-treasure mapsNEUTRAL:- in the beginning, Ezio always is out of money, because equipment, repairs and collectibles are overpriced, but towards the end you're a millionaire, and after you have purchased everything you could, treasure hunting and villa upgrades become pointless; it's the same thing in AC3- I mostly used the sword, assassin's blades, throwing knifes and smoke bombs throughout the game, also occasionally the pistol; but the dagger and poison did not come in handy – fun to try, but other weapons are just more practicalCONS:- camera rotation – it does not always follow Ezios directions, which is especially problematic in narrow surroundings inside buildings (e.g., secret areas) to the point that it takes multiple attempts to succesfully perform a back leap- Ezio freezes while sitting on corners (a problem in chase scenes)- sometimes the eliminated targets do not disappear from the mini-map, which is a bit confusing when you need to find the next one- the missions towards the end of main game story were too simplistic and with some notable faults in terms of layout, AI's behaviour and navigation, as if the developers rushed the game to release it on time; but luckily that changes after you proceed to the DLC part of the game – the story is fascinating again and even the gameplay itself is much smoother- some puzzles do not make sense or the clues are hardly visible- it's not possible to change Ezio's outfit after Altair's costume is acquiredMy overall rating: 9/10.

												Time for a negative review that doesn't talk about UPlay.There's a great attention to detail in this game in the world, textures, modeling, sound, and, to some extent, the writing. However, this same care seems lacking when it comes to actual gameplay. Additionally, a few problems with the scripting and cutscenes really damage the immersion they try to create with the detailed world. Also, it's too long (I would say I enjoyed 10 hours of the 20 it took me to beat the game).As you put your first few hours into this game, you'll probably have a great time as you get a hang of the mechanics and complete the various different challenges spread throughout the world. You really have to stick with it to get to the part where the game starts becoming an unpleasant slog.The freerunning/climbing in this is pretty cool, but the moment you run into a situation where you don't understand why you can't grab something or your character doesn't do what you wanted them to, it'll sour the experience. It's very difficult to translate analog stick input into a selection from such a rich, complex space of possible movements, and I honestly can't see what they could've done to make this work better. These problems wouldn't hurt the game experience so much if they didn't have sections that rely heavily on these mechanics in a way that brings out the flaws of the movement engine. The most glaring issue is the sections that cause a memory to restart from the beginning if you are detected. For some reason, the environments that these missions took place in were prone to eliciting these movement issues. Getting detected is not only frustrating because  you have to start from the beginning of the section, but because it doesn't feel like it's your fault - you just didn't expect the character to move in a certain way. You're unlikely to run into this problem until you're well into the game.There's just so many situations when you are freerunning where it's not clear what your character is going to do or they do something you don't want them to do. Like getting stuck crouching on small waist high ledges when all you want to do is go to the ground, causing you to become easily visible to enemies you were trying to avoid and slowing down your movement. Then when you try to get off the ledge, instead of just jumping to the ground, he tries to jump to a handhold or another ledge.The combat is dreadfully boring. You wait for an enemy to attack and parry. Or you hold block and then hit attack in a rhythm until the enemy dies. For some enemies, they take lots of hits until they die, even with the strongest sword. It's unnecesarilly drawn out because of this. All they needed to do is to make combat shorter and less frequent. It happens far too often, even if you are being stealthy, and is just thoughtless. And it's so easy that it actually encourages you to avoid stealth and just kill everyone instead of wasting a bunch of time sneaking around.The stealth aspect of the gameplay is infuriating. You won't realize it until you get a bit into the game and have sections where any detection means you'll fail and have to start from the beginning of the checkpoint. For the most part, it's pretty clear when an enemy will see you. But, again, as you get later into the game, you'll run into challenges that are set up in a way that they bring out all the flaws of the enemy detection system (I'm looking at you, liutenant assassination memories). It could be made much less frustrating by either providing more feedback on why you are getting spotted, by having more frequent checkpoints, or by simply designing the challenges in a way that acknowledges the weaknesses of the detection system and avoiding them. This is the main reason I regret my time with this game - the ""avoid detection"" sections made me so mad, and this really ruined the game for me. Deviously, these frustrating sections come right towards the end of the game, meaning they'll stick out most in your mind as you think about your experience with the game.Finally, while they do an excellent job of trying to capture the historical setting via the modeling, sound, textures, and music, several key flaws ruin this immersion. The main flaws involve the actual stuff that happens in these memories being unbelievable or not fitting with the story. For example, there's seceral scenes where armed soldiers jump 50 feet down out of nowhere to fight you in a forced combat section. Or, the first time you fight the spaniard, you actually kill him by bringing his health down to zero during the combat, but in the cutscene that immediately follows he looks completely unfazed and isn't dead. Or, during the last battle with the spaniard, you have several allies that proceed to stand there and do nothing as you wail on him over and over and over, just pressing X over and over again until you get his health to 0.  These sort of strange, immersion-breaking moments are everywhere. Overall, it just feels like the implementation of the writing in terms of cutscenes and memories became sloppier and sloppier as I got further in the game. I almost feel like they were tricking me by having the game be fun at the start and hiding the unpolished, unpleasant parts towards the end of the game when I had already invested time into it.And this game just drags on and on without changing it up enough. I'm fine with a long game as long as it's still interesting, but this game is long and samey. If the game was half this length, I might've changed this to a recommendation.In sum, if you have lots of time and like just running around completing quests and stuff like that, you might like this, but you have a lot of other great open world games that provide that experience in a much better way than this game. Other than that, I would absolutely not recommend this - it's just not fun enough through the whole game and, while fun at times, will ultimately leave you feeling frustrated, unsatisfied, and whishing you had spent valuable hours of your life playing something more consistently fun.

												First of all, I must say I've got about +50hrs of gameplay of AC2 on PS3. I have finished the game twice and it is still one of my favorite game ever. The graphics are still good in 2016 and the story is amazing ! you should very get this game + AC:Brotherhood. In a negative way, you need Uplay to run the game wich I dosen't like very well... TL;DR: Buy the f*cking game right now.			"

												Assassin's Creed 2 is the second game of the Assassins Creed franchise , and , said by many, the best one yet.The scenario is redistribuited throughout various citys like Florenze, Venezia , Romagnia and temporarily the game is located in the XV century more precisely throughout 22 years of the life of Ezio Auditore de Firenze.Let's evaluate it!Graphics --- 75/100 : The graphics on Assassin's Creed 2 are ( by the time of this review ) already outdated. While it is very ""chompy"" for us already,back in 2009 I believe they were astonishing.                                                                                                  I think, nonetheless, that the models of the faces of some characters ( especially the less relevant ones ) could be more detailed despite the age of the game.Sounds --- 75/100 : The soundtrack in this games offers plenty of pleasure moments especially when the city guards are pursuing you while you parkour in the XV century Florence rooftops. That angelic specific music suits wonderfuly in the parkour moments and I absolutely loved it.Despite the good soundtrack, some dialogs of the civilians were extremely repetitive and a reason to mock.Story --- 90/100 : Great Story! You are Desmond Miles, a normal person whose ancients were several generations of Assassin's. You are caught in a war between Templars ( the bad guys) and Assassin's ( The good guys). In the first title you are kidnapped by the templars while in this title you are caught by the Assassin's. Due to the low resources of the Assassin's ( that have to face a source of infinite resources that feeds the Templars) you incarnate as Ezio Auditore de Firenze as a way of seeking more information about the Pieces of Eden , and the  main goal , to train you.Ezio Auditore de Firenze is motivated by revenging the ones that killed his family and throughout the course continues the work of his father about ancient artifacts called The Pieces of Eden. Gameplay --- 85/ 100 --- Nothing really new here. Fantastic combat system that , in my mere opinion , could be more punishing.The game feels ,after some hours, repetitive due to a decent length in the story time. The social features of the game are well achieved although they could make it a little bit more imersive. In the end , the game deserves :   81 / 100  "

												If you are interested about the series, but are not sure how it plays out, I recommend not to buy this one. Buy AC: Brotherhood which is a better game in gameplay and level design. This I recommend only to those who want to start the Ezio Auditore da Firenze plotline from the beginning. For the subplot(modern day), one propably could go for this or the first. The subplot doesn't advance that much during one game, so it really doesn't matter. Ezio plot isn't that great in this game, it's a bit illogical revenge story. It's feels occasionally quite forced and all the side quests feel like just ""something extra to do, but not relevant in any way to anything"". I understand the game has a bit long time scale, but it still kind of feels funny that Ezio would be spending his time running races on the rooftops against random people just for few florins. Especially since florins are quite useless after 1/4 of the game.Level desing is good most of the time and the cities are quite interesting places. On the other hand, player spends most of his time on the rooftops. There's not much to see on the streets apart from walking people, so there's no reason to walk around just for fun. Also this game takes place in many cities, so one does not get familiar with any of them. General flaw in a sandbox game I think: make the city so big that no one never learns to recognize anything else but the minimap screen. Then again the game artificially constrains some areas as ""not available"" until later in the game. I also recommend having a controller to this game. I played my first with kboard and mouse and now I played with controller and it felt so much better, even though not as good as AC: Brotherhood. Especially since this game doesn't have a proper key mapping.All in all, it's not a bad game, it just has some annoying flaws and almost everything is made better in AC: Brotherhood. So I say I recommend this game, but with a grain of salt.			"

												Assassin's Creed 2  takes place after the events of first game, Desmond is still in Abstergo prison when suddenly Lucy came to rescue him. After rescuing Desmond she relocates him in one of the secret assassin hideouts. This time Desmond must go inside animus once more and locate and aquire the apple of eden and become a true assassin through the memories of Ezio Audotore. Ezio is florentine nobleman who lived during the renaissance. At the age of 17 he witnessed his father and two brothers being executed which forced him, his sister and mother to flee to Tuscany, Moteriggioni at Villa Auditore. After learning about his heritage from, his uncle Mario, Ezio began his assassin training and set on his quest for vengeance against templar order, and their master Rodrigo Borgia who ordered the execution. Even though the game follows the cliche of ""muh revenge"" it's still pretty good story and gameplay wise plus you get to visit many iteresting locations like Venice and Florence and meet interesting characters of that time including Leonardo Da Vinci.The gameplay in first installment wasn't really polished, but in AC2 controls are responsive and movement is fluid. The animations are smooth, wide variety finishing blows and finally you get to chose what weapons  and armor you equip. You also have new tools to make your assassinations easier and more interesting like double hidden blade, pistol, poison blade and now you can fight with hidden blade and won't get pushed back and lose HP like in the first game. I also enjoyed the assassin tombs which where rather interesting and rewarding. Once finished all tombs you get Altair's armor as a reward for your work. What I really hated is lack of stealth in this game, considering the first game clearly established how assassins operate: they're never seen or heard and kills only key target. I also disliked how guards were guarding seemingly uninportant locations which does no good to the series and breaks immersion. Overall it's pretty fun to play but could be better polished with more possibilities like stealth for hardcore fans.The only downside I can think of is cancer named uPlay. When I purchased the game there was no mention in store page about 3rd party software. It is really annoying to punish paying customers by making trilions of accounts just to play one game. In this case it's Uplay. I don't know why I am required to register ANOTHER account just to play a game I already purchased on steam, don't make me use another platform. It is the only downside of the game, the DRM so if you're OK with purchasing it on steam and then adding it on Uplay go ahead. It's experience you don't want to miss out on. 8/10			"

PROS:+ Historically deep and very interesting plot, full of conspiracy theories.+ Big, open, beautiful cities with lots of things to discover.+ Very fun main objectives which introduces new mechanics and fun ""toys"" :).+ Good character development.+ Lots of collectibles which are actually rewarding.+ New economy. You can purchase equipment and more.+ Graphics are also pretty good for it's age.CONS:- VERY easy combat and stupid AI.- Controls sometimes become frustrating and let you to make an unintended move such as jumping down a building or killing a civilian etc. But you get used to it as you play.VERDICT: Ubisoft managed to fix almost every problem with the first game and uncovered the true potential of the Assassin's Creed series. ACII is the true representative of the series; it is a masterpiece of it's time.			"

Posted: February 21, 2016
												Just under a year ago I reviewed  Assassin's Creed 1 where I ultimately felt it was... alright... but multiple shortcomings and poor design choices held it back from true greatness. This time around, they've somehow managed to do almost exactly the same thing but in almost completely different ways. They've handled the story very differently, but still haven't improved it, they've tweaked the gameplay but inadvertently only served to highlight its flaws in the process, and they've given us lots of new toys to play with, but merely replaced one set of inconsequential features for a whole bunch of different ones. It's kind of both impressive and baffling how little actual progress they seem to have made from so much work.The first time around, the story shifted constantly from a future setting to past, exploring a particular family lineage, but it was such a mess of writing, acting and mishandled plot that it was easily the least interesting thing the game ended up doing. This time, the future setting is pushed way into the background and largely just bookends the game and its story, coming across as baggage the developers grudgingly tried to deal with as little and as best they could. To that end, we play as Ezio in 15th century Italy as he is unwittingly drawn into the midst of a dangerous conspiracy, learning of the struggle between Assassins and Templars as they try to shape the players and politics of the day to take over the country, and ultimately the world. There's more to this as the game makes call backs to the mysterious artefact at the heart of the first game (among other things *wink-wink*), but it never feels as grand or as crucial as they probably mean it to be, and just as with the first game, I couldn't bring myself to care about the whys and found myself increasing checked out of the story, my interest having already long since departed way before the anticlimactic end. Only two games into a thirteen game series, I'm already done with the lore and wish it wasn't a thing anymore. The kernel of a good idea is tangible, but it frustratingly never seems to become anything more than that.The gameplay fairs little better in its changes. The previous game had three large cities and a large hub area of towns, fields, canyons and various other sights connecting them. There was little to do here, though, so unless you really loved collectathons and sightseeing then you were bang outta luck and just had to endure the trip between main events. Thankfully, the hub area has been removed and we're instead given two very large cities, two small cities (with surrounding fields and swamplands) and your very own town to renovate. Once you're let loose to roam free in these places that's where the fun really begins, and also where the heartache hits, too, as what should be a simple joy becomes a near constant struggle and an increasing source of frustration.My memories of traversal in the first game are good ones, always having a really nice sense of effortless flow to movement. Whether it was leaping across rooftops or scaling up walls, it just felt right, and very rarely did anything bad about it ever come to my attention. Here, however, I literally could hardly go a couple of minutes without encountering some kind of issue. Ezio seems magnetically drawn to damn near every object and you can barely run anywhere near a vertical surface without him trying to automatically leap onto it. Dislodging yourself from anything takes way too long, and he pretty much only jumps from anything in a 90 degree, X or Y axis direction. So, many times I wanted to jump one way but it was impossible because it wasn't aligned exactly with the limited directions he could jump. Add to this the camera that constantly insists on ""helping"" you into new angles or straight up removing your control of it completely, plus its annoying sensitivity that was never decent no matter how I adjusted it, or the frequent frame rate stutters, and the whole thing was a never-ending battle to control adequately, leaping to my death on several occasions because of the bad camera and jumping/climbing/grabbing system.As with the previous title, the world itself and its scale is the star of the show which impresses most. The fact that there's only brief loading between main areas and cut scenes or missions is something I feel the games probably don't get enough credit for. Ditto with the sound design that really stood out to me on many occasions while they'd largely go unnoticed for me in other games. Visually, most of the areas are very ""busy"", which may make everything a bit of a blur of visual white noise, but I still greatly appreciated the effort once again in crafting such a fully realised world when they probably could have gotten away with less, between the overall layout, texture detail, and abundance of NPC models that fill the world. But, sadly, as with many other aspects, the busy-ness of the game also worked against it as there was a lot of what I can only think to describe as architectural clutter - basically lots of structures and pieces sticking out of every building in one place or another and getting in your way. It's clear they were placed with the intention of helping you get around faster or more gracefully, but it had the opposite effect on me as Ezio would continuously bump into stuff or grab on to out-of-the-way objects then take an age to let go of them. It just killed so much of the momentum and pace, and a lot of the fun along with it.Like I said, there are many new features, like upgrading your small fortress town, but aside from some aesthetic changes that you probably won't even notice, rather than unlocking new things, they only generate more money for you. But since it's such a non-issue in the game and you'll rarely ever find yourself wanting for more, this seemed useless to me. As too where many of the additional weapons and abilities. Again, the combat is a chore. I never felt engaged or threatened, just like I'd hit a tedious roadblock to endure rather than enjoy. But one of the most notable additions were tombs, extra challenge areas of sorts where you had to test your agility across obstacle courses and receive a small reward at the end. But, really, all these actually did were remind me of the game's main influence once again, Prince of Persia, except not nearly as fun as that masterpiece.For all my moaning about it, again, as with its predecessor, I'm rating it up not because I necessarily loved it, but because there isn't enough to truly hate on it. It never infuriates so much or for so long that it's ruinous, just occasionally annoying. And really, its worst crime isn't that it's bad, just that it's kinda dull and never becomes all that it could be. It has one trick that it repeats over and over, that makes it fun for the first five or so hours, but which I was completed done with by hour forty... go some place, climb some stuff, kill a guy, on to the next one. That's it. I wish every area was its own separate space, in its own time period and with its own character that only he or she would operate within independent of the others. Each would have their own skills or abilities (or lack of) and would require the player to play differently with each one, switching back and forth as preferred and completing every mission in whichever order they chose. It would mostly kill off the feeling of repetition and maybe even make the cities themselves have a greater sense of functional purpose rather than suspiciously coming across as filler impersonating content. Until that day comes, while I'm sure many will adore this, I ran out of enthusiasm for it far sooner than I ever should have. So, maybe don't read this as an endorsement of Assassin's Creed 2, so much as a recommendation for Prince of Persia. Seriously, those games are awesome.			"

												Assassin's Creed 2 is the direct sequel to the first Assassin's Creed game, a 3rd person stealth combat game that improved over it's predecessor in every way. The main improvement is it's NOT repetitive. There are many more mission types. The cities are so much bigger and more vibrant. There is an economy where you can earn money and spend it on upgrades. The people are more interesting and real, including Ezio himself. The sounds of battle and cities are as real as they can be.Your hero is Ezio Auditore, a young Italian noble. Whereas in the first Assassin's Creed, you were the main protagonist Altaïr based in Damascus, Jerusalem, and Acre. Ezio's sort of cross between Nathan Drake, Casanova, and Batman. The story (ignoring the bits outside the Animus) is a great revenge-conspiracy plot set through over 20 years of Ezio's life. While I won't pretend all the character's are memorable, they're all played with personality and wit and the voice actors never strike a false note.The gameplay is also MUCH more fun and more varied than AC1. Gone are the investigation bits of an assasination but added are more story-based, action-packed missions for you to work through up to your assassinations. These, again are fun and each mission you go on feels completely unique to the one before it. Even the optional assassinations have more rules and complexities as you work through them.Also, it easily has one of the best soundtrack. The music is not only original and cool, it changes perfectly to match the action in the game (chase scenes, flying, hiding etc).Pros:+ Platforming elements are extremely polished and satisfying; climbing is simple in practice and is competently animated+ Environments are large, detailed and absolutely gorgeous; renaissance Italy is wonderfully detailed and makes for some astonishing set-pieces+ Voice-acting is competent and on-par with the original+ UI, though it breaks the immersion a bit, is practical and aesthetically pleasing+ Bissfully short load-times; game's engine runs smoothly and efficiently+ Myriad collectibles and viewpoints to unlock, scattered throughout the world+ Animations are fluid and well-handled by the game's engine+ Assassinations are as fun as ever, with a plethora of additional features and options not seen in the first installment+ There is now a currency system, and a theft mechanic to compliment it; this can be used to upgrade arms and armor, which is exceptional in terms of aesthetics+ Missions and side missions are entertaining to play through, and enjoy a bit more variation that the original installment could boast+ Interesting plot, which does well to continue that of the first game; dialogue, too, is moderately well-written+ Can renovate and upgrade 'home city'Cons:- Requires you to have UPlay and a consistent internet connection- Not much of a re-playability factor after you finish the gameTL;DR:8.5/10Game is leap and bounds above it's original title, where in the first you would have to scan an entire area then go on to the next, rinse and repeat, as well as have repetitive combat lead to a very mundane boring game even though it had an amazing plot. It's improved on in every aspect of the game. Added with motivational points to strive towards to achieve certain things such as Altair's armor and upgrading your home, there's plenty of things to not get bored in this game about.			"

												This is by far one of my favorite Assassin's Creed games. I've followed the series from the beginning... playing as Altair was fun, but Ezio just has so much more depth to his charecter, not to mention style. That moment you get the second hidden blade is just satisfying. Then ezio gains a hidden pistol, which was also fun. I've played through this game several times... IDK, maybe I am partial due to my nostalgia and overall love for the Ezio games.The game is not perfect though. As with most AC games, thee main charecter, Ezio in this case, does not always do what you want him to. Trying to climb boxes in front of you sometimes leads to running up the adjacent wall, or just jumping over boxes atogether. Most of the time this problem is negligable, except during the most frustrating aspect of this game: timed puzzles. Specifically, a good number of Assassin's Tombs. Many of the tombs have timed areas and if Ezio jumps in the water or at the wall instead of jumping to that beam... welll, you have to start over. If you don't care about getting 100% or getting Altair's armor, then skip these puzzles. Honestly, you can beat the game easily without upgrading your health much. The only reason I fully upgrade Ezio's heath is so that if Ezio decides to jump off a tall building without my permission, he will live.Wow, that was a ramble. You have earned yourself a cookie for reading this far.			"

												For me this was the true start of the Assassin's Creed franchise, with the original game being more of a proof of concept. I very much enjoyed the improvements over its predecessor and it set the scene for the next two titles with some pretty strong storytelling. Now that i have mentioned the story let me say that the whole animus/current day storyline does tie the games together with a bit more meaning they were (to me at least) completely throw away and i believe i would have enjoyed them all the same withouttl;dr  -  better than the first, with even better to come7/10 - would requiescat in pace again			"

												Definitely my favourite assassins creed game by far. The story is amazing and introduced my favourite assassin, Ezio. The game might not be as advanced as the newer games like Blackflag, Syndicate and Unity but the story in this game is by far the best story out of any game (I have played through every game on console) and is very engaging. The parkour in this game may seem slow in comparison to the newer games but I find that you have a lot more control and accuracy when scaling buildings and etc.The only problem I have with this game is at times a very low frame rate(goes down to 10 or below at times) but usually stays at around 20 fps which isnt great, but is better than 10.I would definitely recommend this game to any fan of the series or for someone looking to get into the series.

												A total step up from the first Assassin's Creed. That was a great game, but AC II is even better. It has better controls(which for AC on PC, the controls are already weird but once you figure them out in one game you have an easy time with the rest of the games), better gameplay, more to do outside of the main story line, and it has captions.

												For everyone who is whining about UPlay, why not check the community, this is a great game, and most of the reviews are about UPlay. I had the issue also, that's when I found this Guide: 


How to make Uplay work 
A Guide for Assassin's Creed II
By: 🐛🐛👀👌👀👌👀👌🏆🍎🎂☕

			This will tell you how to actually run the game... dispite ubisoft's best efforts to screw you.		


it's easily fixable, took me 5 minutes. Some people also might have a soundcard issue (audio playing through speakers) and usually a quick restart will do the trick. (And side note, controls are easily changed)Hopefully this helped and/or encouraged to purchase this fantastic game			"

												Assassin's Creed 2. What to say one of the best games in Assassin's Creed collection and one of the best in Eizo's trilogy.Story:In a vast open world environment, the game invites players to incarnate Ezio, a privileged young noble in Renaissance Italy who's been betrayed by the rival ruling families of Italy. Ezio's subsequent quest for vengeance plunges players into an epic story that offers more variety in missions, surprising and engaging new gameplay elements, diverse weapons and a profound character progression.They also represent a good mix of fictional characters – like Ezio’s family and his acrobatic thief allies – and actual historical figures, including the great Lorenzo di Medici and Leonardo da Vinci, who as Ezio’s closest friend plays a major role in the story.You can complete the main story in 15-20 hours.My opinion:What makes this game better from other AC games is that this game has a good story which it's well designed.Story: 10/10Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 9.6/10Game Physic: 8.9/10Sounds: 9.7/10Difficulty: 3/5Overall rating: 9.6/10			"

												I now remember why I uninstalled the first installment of Assassin's Creed: finicky controls and restrictive kill conditions made combat a chore. In this sequel, Ubisoft couldn't fix the controls so they loosened up the combat mechanics, making your protagonist a match for even a crowd of enemies out in the open while removing much of the restrictions for a successful assassination. Instead of fixing flaws, they gave you more tools to navigate through the same engine. ""More rather than better"" seems to be the theme of the day. You can collect around 30 different weapons but darn if I can figure out why I need that many when there are only three types of enemies and you're encouraged to commit your assassinations quietly. There are a ridiculous amount of hidden chests but the bulk of your income will come from your villa and frankly, it's ridiculous that your main money pit (villa restorations) serves to increase your revenue. Between endless assassination side quests, puzzle deciphering and collectibles, I have over 25 hours of gameplay and am still roughly in the middle of the main storyline. This game is positively bloated with filler. What you lose from all of those extra combat mechanics is your overall sense of vulnerability in being a shadowy assassin. Who needs stealth when you can take on a crowd of enemies and still win? All I wanted was a fix to the backstabs from the first game; suddenly I'm face-stabbing a full company of armored brutes with only a couple of smoke bombs as my cover. Cheap, plentiful medicine makes health hardly an issue. All your methods for hiding in plain sight have been kept from the previous game but they've added ways to decrease your aggro from the guards, making your hiding techniques superfluous! An especially heinous mention needs to be given to the uPlay DRM which kept crashing on updates and various occasions. Obviously, I've managed to circumvent this problem if I've coped this far but it's still a frustrating experience to figure out why you can't play your own game. I also believe it's messing with my Steam Achievements, as in uPlay's Achievements are written over the Steam ones. This isn't sounding like the most enthusiastic of endorsements but Assassin's Creed 2 is merely a flawed game, not an outright unenjoyable one. The characters you meet are engaging, the exploration sequences filled with secrets and those assassination side quests might be filler but they offer some fun challenges along the way. The problem is that you don't *need* to do any of these extra side quests: your reward for those is money and you can get all the money you want simply by waiting. You play this game for the story, the variety of content and the opportunity to roleplay as a Renaissance hitman. Good enough.			"

Assassin's Creed II is an parkour beat'em up adventure game. Escaping from Abstergo Industries and joining a crew of Assassins, Desmond relives the life of another ancestor, Ezio Auditore, an Assassin from Renaissance Italy who sought to avenge his family's murder at the hands of Templars while uncovering a conspiracy of his own.Pros: This game builds on what made the first Assassin's Creed a success, while introducing a new climbing and combat mechanics. Although less numerous, cities are larger and taller than ever before, gaining access to new areas almost up until the end-game. You have a home base, Villa Auditore in Monteriggioni, in which you can invest to get recurring in-game revenue. The story is interesting and intriguing, and missions are less rinse & repeat than the previous game. Although the graphics are some years old, they still hold as ok by today's standards.Cons: There is very little development with the overarching plot that made Desmond travel back to Altaïr's and Ezio's memories in the first place. If you invest early enough in Villa Auditore, money becomes trivial quickly, making sidequests like races and assassination contracts pointless, and you will make little to no use of the items you get from collecting feathers. Fighting can get somewhat repetitive, and late-game bosses pose no more challenges in a fight than the average guard, albeit taking more strikes to get rid of. There are no random events, so you will pretty much fast-travel all the time as soon as you've been to a region once.Verdict: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!Overall, this game is a good followup to its predecessor, finishing on a cliffhanger much like the first game. It remains nonetheless a satisfying playthrough, and I'll recommend it to anyone who haven't already played the sequels.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												Assassin's Creed II is the BEST AC game I have every played, the story for this game is fantastic and with the DLC that adds both Battle of Forli and Bonfire of the Vanities you will get an expanded storyline that is missing in the game if you do not have the ACII Deluxe Edition. The game is set in the 21st century and follows Desmond Miles as he relives the genetic memories of his ancestor Ezio Auditore da Firenze. The story takes place at the height of the Renaissance in Italy during the 15th and early 16th century. In ACII there is a lot of new abilities that the player has access to that were not available in the first AC. Now you can now use Eagle Vision in third-person view and while moving and you also now have the ability to swim. Now you can hire different groups of NPCs, such as mercenaries, courtesans, or thieves to help you fight, distract, or lure guards some thing that the first AC game never had. A day and night cycle has also been added to the game, giving the game more of a sense of time. The game takes place in an open world environment with nonlinear gameplay, allowing the player to roam freely within several regions throughout late fifteenth-century Italy such as Venice, Florence, Forlì, San Gimignano, and the Tuscan countryside. ACII has added a lot of new side-missions that you can access any time throughout the game like now they have added Assassin Tombs which is an optional side-mission to find all of the Assassin Seals to unlock the legendary Armor of Altaïr. Overall I give this game a 10/10 it is a huge improvement over the first AC game and I reckon it is probably the best AC game out there. I really cannot recommend this game to you enough it is just fantastic I am absolutely 100% sure that this game will not disappoint you in anyway at all!.			"

												At first, I thought this game was good. Oh boy, how wrong I was. Horrible chase sequences, an endless stream of guards for you to kill with each mission(you might be better playing PAYDAY 2 instead of this game), subpar story, and on top of all that you get horrible mechanics and controls. After playing this game for 25 hours, I didn't even get to finishing it. I got to the last part of the game, but then the game refused to let me finish until I return to old areas to collect half the pages I missed. I ended up watching a playthrough and being massively disappointed. Only good thing about this game is the character you get to play as and that is not enough for me to recommend it.			"

There is no doubt if you like storyline games especially sequels this is the game you need to get.Assassin Creed games after Revelations are just wrong, from ac1 to revelations is timeline which just continue, the sucky thing in newer AC games is that the Desmond dies (imagine that) lol and just not worth getting. But let it go, we are talking about AC 2 now, so yes grab it ASAP you won't regret it.			"

												Great story, immersive world and quite impressive graphics - these three make AC2 an awesome game, overall, and I dare to say even the best from the entire AC series. Even though I'm not a big fan of Ubisoft and their work, I find this game a special snowflake out there. Being historically inaccurate may be one of the very few cons for the game, but at the same time it can be a pro, a tone of creativity, an interesting way to see history from another perspective, even though it's fictional and fanciful, especially in the end of the story. That stuff at the end really made a mess in my brain, but I respect that Ubisoft tries to play with the history and human beliefs in this manner... Afterall, the gameplay matters a lot more, and this makes AC2 a game not just worth playing, but even mandatory for those who consider themselves true gamers.			"

												Unlike it's predecessor, AC2 is strongly storydriven. There is no more stalking of your prey through sidequests and progress is handled solely through the story. Sidequests now simply have you do a specific task related to some of your skills.This can work out, as it allows you to rush through and get the most out of the story, while still allowing you to partake in any particular activity. Want an assassination mission? Go find a pigeon stand and off you go.Combat-wise, AC2 is an overall improvement on everything. The dual blades work just as effective as you would imagine they have and you can buy your own weapons. Leaving you free choice over your main weapon, as well as your off-hand.Because of how the story works, you'll always feel a sense of lineairity in the story. But since we are revisiting 'memories', this is perfectly excusable. And your approach to a combat situation is often left open anyway. You are free, within boundaries.The landscapes and towns are a sight to behold, and the characters feel interesting too, albeit not enough explored by my taste. (save for Ezio) If you don't mind an AC game that is more storydriven, it's worth buying to follow the story.			"

												The sequel to Assassin's Creed begins a new story from Desmond's genetic memories of a young Italian nobleman named Ezio Auditore da Firenze. The second game greatly expands upon the original in terms of gameplay as well as storytelling. Using a number of historical figures, Assassin's Creed II (AC2) successfully immerses you into historical fiction with a sci-fi twist and will leave you wanting more. Overall, AC2 offers a more open experience and allows you to customize your version of Ezio while also stemming away from the original's narrow/linear gameplay. AC2 is a must for fans, but it should be noted that AC2 require Ubisoft's Uplay as the game's launchpad.			"

												You play Desmond again who is playing a guy who is running around Italy killing everyone who is linked with the murder of his family. He is also is an art lover, and collector. This game is better than the first in many ways, but it is long. I felt more accomplished at the 20 hour point when I had collected every painting in the game and upgraded montenegro than I did in at the final story mark. Though collecting all the assassin gear in the crypts also was a big moment for me.Again, you can't skip the cutscenes, but this time they slip QTE events in with them.The game seems to borrow some elements of the openworld from Far Cry 2, which in essence just lets things react to you, rather thant strategically enable you to change the world based on your actions (as in the first game). Good game none the less. Loads of improvements, but the ""Game"" aspect of it all really ended at about the 20 hour mark for me and the rest of the game was rolling out the assassin targets and finding chests filled with f (oh and feathers, erg).

												This game, in my opinion, perfects the Assassin's Creed formula. The story is really engaging, and I absolutely love the depiction of Renaissance Italy. The assassinations themselves felt fun and challenging to play out. There are a huge variety of weapons available in the game, letting you carry out missions in different ways. The side activity of renovating a village is also a lot of fun - it is cool to see the area change over time as you acquire more wealth. The game may be old, but it still feels fresh and fun to play.			"

Embedded with enough non fictional history to make the player very much a part of the experience. The game is less linear then AC and offers more elements of an open world environment. Much better controls for mouse and keyboard too!  Can’t wait to dive into AC2 Brotherhood and Revelations!			"

												I love this game, I did a speedrun pretty much and completed it in just under 7 hours. It is a huge improvment on the original Assassin's Creed because it has some depth to the story line and isn't just Kill and Repeat. I played this game for the first time on a PS3 a few years ago and instantly enjoyed the freerun style so when I signed up to steam and quite recently bought it, it is almost impossible for me to give it a negative review. I feel like the people who don't enjoy this series have either picked up the wrong genre or are not willing to sit down and put a good few hours into a game. 11/10 would play again.			"

												The second in the classic frustration series, however we have much improved controls and a character who finally will not drown in a heavy rain (sarcastic joke there for those who cannot sense sarcasm over the internet tubes) The continuation of the story of a poor sap yanked off the streets and stuck into a machine to relive his ancestor's past (apparently his ancestors moved from the middle east to Italy at some point) and his (suddenly hotter?) lab geek assistant and their merry adventures in stabby-stabby-land.I kid, well not about the frustration levels, Ubisoft seems to love programming in what I call the D-Move (you figgure it out) where cameras suddenly wont face the way you need them to in a timed race, your character jumps off at weird angles not of your choosing and so on, but I really did enjoy this game.If you're hell bent on yelling at a screen until everyone around you thinks you're totally mental and need to be medicated then this is the perfect game for you, btw I had to type this review with my toes because the straight jacket prevents me from using my hands, enjoy.

												Absolutely loved this game, miles more in-depth and immersing than the original AC. Brilliant story line, somewhat improved controls, and much more longevity given the amount of side-missions available. Far less in-and-outing of the animus, something I found incredibly annoying in the original, and when you are out, you actually have things to do as opposed to listening to someone speak, 'sleeping', then waking up and getting back in (AKA pointless time wasting to make the game seem longer).The fact that you can live Ezio's life, by making money, speaking with family members, using different character types to assist you in missions, means you become more invested in the game. If I had one gripe about a certain character type it would be that the courtesans automatically leave you to 'distract' gaurds when they're near one, even if you didn't want them to and you were only passing by. I find thieves to be the most effective distraction personally, even if they do accidentally die falling off rooftops a lot.			"

												A sequel better than the first game in every aspect.--You can now wield several weapons. You have bigger ones at your disposal (such as two-handed swords, axes and hammers) that have different animations and make the combat look even more exciting.--Your protagonist, Ezio, can actually swim this time. This is a must as you'll go to Venice and you have missions where swimming is necessary or just helpful in order to get rid of enemies.--To be honest, I was not familiar with the era of the first game. Now, when it comes to the 15th century the second installment takes place in it brought back memories from history classes. It's actually quite cool that Ezio regularly visits Leonardo Da Vinci and at one point in the game you get to use his flying machine.--There are a lot of cities in the game with TONS of side missions. You even have your own mansion surrounded by several buildings. You can upgrade these and the economy system incorporated provides you with a steady income. --Obviously, the game employs better graphics and you also have night-day cycle in the sequel. Horse-riding returns and it still looks cool.--Enemies are more varied and you are required to use different tactics instead of just bashing the counter key when it is necessary. Also, countering is easier this time.--The incorporated notoriety system requires you to lay low for a while after a fight with the soldiers in town - otherwise you are recognised as the local villain and immediately get attacked by the next group of guards.--No more eavesdropping and pick pocketing as mandatory missions! There were far too many in the first game and after a while they became annoying and very repetitive. Thank God the sequel has more varied and exciting missions and locales.--The plot is more interesting this time and while Altair you got to know from the beginning as an assassin Ezio now starts out as teenage boy of a noble family unaware of the conflict between the Templars and Assassins. You follow his story from the very beginning and it is nice to see how his personality develops as the plot thickens.It may be the best in the series. This episode introduced a lot of new features that have since become the signature components of every Assassin's Creed game to date.			"

												The 2 more common complains for Assassin's Creed were the amount of bugs, and the repetitiveness of the level and mission design. And Ubisoft really learned the lesson about the second one. Each city is huge, very huge, with hundreds of side-missions, places to explore, objects to search and collect, a village to improve and much more. The plot gives a turn, showing for the first time was is really going on, and mixing science fiction with a touch of fantasy. And the multiple plot details, based makes the story much more credible. The visual aspect, even when is quite remarkable, is not what really stands out, but the absurdly amazing art and design. Again, each corner of the renaissance Italy is detailed, rich, full of life. One thing is disliked is that the game feels stretched, and when you think is going to be over soon, still has at least 3 hours of plot related gameplay. With only that ""flaw"" aside, the second title of the Assassin's saga is a game that I won't stop recommending.			"

												Set over 500 years before the events of the original game in the series, Assassin's Creed 2 is a prequel to 2009's much-loved game of the year - Batman: Arkham Asylum.Ezio Auditore da Firenze (it's Spanish for Wayne), one of Batman's long-lost ancestors, has his memories perved on by some random guy Batman Incorporated picked up off the streets as an excuse for training - and thus one of the greatest stories of revenge told in video game media begins.Following the untimely deaths of his family in true Bruce-esque fashion, Ezio decides to  take on the mantle of the Batman, protector of Gotham: Italy Edition and its people. Despite his lack of training, Ezio immediately sprints out the batcave and begins to clean the streets (a broomstick is a viable weapon in this game, apparently). With the help of his good friend Leonardo DaVinci (French for Pennyworth), Ezio sets out with a positive arsenal of exotic weaponry; from an early Batarang, which due to technical limitations of the time, only has 1 hyper-sharp blade, and doesn't really come back after use, to the grapple, which instead of attaching to buildings from a long distance, functions as a way of holding close targets in place - with optional fatal injury. What unfolds is a spellbinding and beautiful tale of family, redemption, revenge and mass murder. Yeah, the whole ""no killing"" thing hasn't really been established yet - but  let's be honest here, I think slamming someone in the neck with a car door and leaving them, broken, miles from the nearest hospital also counts as murder.Along with a majestic soundtrack, the game also improves immersion with a launcher inspired by renaissance-era technology. I found the 30 or so minutes I had to spend getting the piece of horse dung to work highly immersive, which, coupled with the painfully intrusive notification system, really made me feel the wonderment and awe of the renaissance.

												Oh how I love this game. This game is a reminder of how good games used to be. If you havent played the assassin's creed series befor, definately pick them up. Although the reecent entrys have been meh at best this one was and still is amazing.Although the free-running mechanics seem somawhat cluncky in this game they are still fun to use, although frustrating at times. when you arent under pressure by any timed stuff the free-running can be a joy and fun to use. The only time it gets annoying is when you have to chase someone of do something thats timed. If your camera and jostick arent in the exact spot you want to go, if its even a millimeter off, you can kiss your shins good by as you do a full 90 degree jump off into the abyse below. If you are chasing someone, expect to run up and jump over everything you don't want to as Ezio automatically decides to run up a wall you wernt aiming for ro to jump off to the left eventhough you were running forward to jump to the other roof.The story for the time was very intreaguing and kept me hooked. I orriginally owned this on the PS3 and i played it over and over again and loved it. The game is long and full of action and stabbing people. The game provides what the title says.My only issue with the game (other than randomly jumping off of stuff to meet my death) is memory sequence 12 and 13. Orriginaly this was dlc and wasnt included in the game for some reason, but with this being the actual ""full game"" it is included. Yet for some reason it felt really shoe horned in. you get to explore  anew district but only for like 5 minutes and all it is there for is to explain how Ezio got a map. (just for clarification sequence 12 and 13 a ""broken"" memories)For me it just made no sence what so ever and kinda killed the flow of the game.The other think that kinda kills the game are the colectables and lack of achevements. the colectables are there for you to unlock stuff. so when you colect 50 feathers you get a weapon (its♥♥♥♥♥♥and buthe time you have colected 50 of them you'd have gotten Altair's sword) and when you get 100 feathers you get the auditore cape that makes you notorious constantly. this is where the absence of achevements comes in. On the consoles there are achevements and there is purpose to these things other than to increace your play time. On pc its pointless. By the time you have aquired this cape there is no point in plying anymore purely for the fact you would have done everytihng. It seemes ted.iousThe only other down side is Uplay. If the servers are down expet to not be able to play this game. seriously uplay and ubisoft its self are the only things that make this and other games♥♥♥♥♥♥to play.All in all id say get this game and enjoy it. Its a fantastic game and definately worth your time.11/10 would Udon'tplay again (Seriously Ubisoft. GET YOUR♥♥♥♥♥♥TOGEATHER!)			"

												We'll never forget that foreshadowing exchange between Ezio and his older brother, Federico, after the two completed a rooftop race: ""It is a good life we lead, brother,"" Federico says, to which Ezio replies ""The best. May it never change."" A heart-wrenching audio track quiets in the background as the two share their appreciations. ""And may it never change us,"" Frederico responds. Then stuff got dark. Ultimately landing AC2 a spot on our list of 100 best games ever made. It took simulated stalking, breathtaking scaling and parkour stunting to all new heights.			"

												Assassin's Creed 2, does everything a sequel needs to do. it added to the gameplay, expanded the story in multiple directions and created a highly memorable character in the form of Ezio Auditore da Firenze. It also lead to such apparent popularity that Ubisoft decided to flog the series into oblivion thereafter with yearly sequels including 2 spin-offs to Ezio's particular story (which where still decent if formulaic).The inclusion of multiplayer as well as an on-the-go manual and historical checkbook, and puzzle minigames made the game enjoyable not only by increasing the rich wealth of historical lore but adding much needed breaks from running over rooftops, causing tiles to crash to the streets below... This and Brotherhood (it's first sequel and second part of Ezio's trilogy) are the best of the Assassin's Creed series, partly because the game was still fresh and partly because the setting of Renaissance Italy was one of the most fascinating areas of history to explore.Highly recommend - will likely become a Classic.

												The Assassins Creed series has thrived ever since the beginning of the game. In this title, you play as Ezio, who is in the search of the people who killed his family. Assassisn Creed II is an amazing game if you like stealth games, but this one is much less modern so you deal with knives, swords and guns that supposedly invented at this time period. You will love this game if you like to complete missions dealing with assassination, stealth and the storyline. This game as a rich storyline and will tempt you to buy the other titles like Brotherhood, Revelations and Black Flag.My only Problem?UPLAY.You have to download and run U play in order to play this game, which is the most annoying thing to deal with. U Play failed to save my work in this game 5 times in a row, which is why I have more playtime in this game than usual. However, look up some fixes for that as you can fix it yourself.8/10 (9.5/10 without U Play)			"

												Having played Assassin's Creed 2 on the PlayStation 3 at launch (and even dared to reach the Platinum Trophy), I can honestly say this ""replay"" was a fun revisit! Now that I've finished Assassin's Creed 2 for my second time (and on PC this time), I still firmly believe this is the best AC game that I've played so far. Story, characters, music... all excellent! The visuals are well done, not ground breaking but they're very decent. And the PC version does offer better graphics.As for the gameplay aspect, I played AC2 mainly with the Xbox One controller and no issues whatsoever. The Keyboard + Mouse scheme wasn't too bad and much improved from AC1 but I still preferred to play AC2 with a gamepad. The gameplay mechanics were refined too from AC1. The parkour works better, the combat is slightly more fluid than AC1.Without giving you too much detail, this game improved in all aspects from AC1. It is a fantastic sequel and if only the other AC games were that good...PROS:+Strong narrative, impressive and deep story, Renaissance setting.+HUGE world to explore.+Ezio Auditore da Firenze is a strong new protagonist in the game.+Secondary characters (npc) were well implemented.+Jesper Kyd music composer (THE BEST AC SOUNDTRACK TO DATE).+More weapons, more ways to kill enemies.+Greater variety of missions / side-missions in AC 2 (Many side missions too if you want to play them (assassinations, courrier, races, etc).+Many Tombs, Templar lairs to uncover and they unlock the most useful item in the game. +Lenghty playtime. Just the story can take you a good 20 hours at least.CONS:-At the game's launch, it required a permanent internet connection. Totally unacceptable for a single player game. Granted, Ubisoft Montreal removed that draconian DRM but years later.-Uplay DRM.-Too many treasures and feathers to collect. The feathers do unlock a useful item once completed but I had no patience to recollect them all over again. Done it once on the PS3 and that's that!-Graphics aren't top notch. A few glitches here and there time to time but nothing gamebreaking at least!OVERALL:A close to perfect sequel! If you loved the first Assassin's Creed game, you'll love this one even more. If you disliked AC1, give AC2 a shot, you may like it as it improved upon the weakneses of AC1.RECOMMENDATION:Si! Even if you never played it, Assassin's Creed 2 is a very good game.RATING:9.0 / 10And now, time to revisit Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood...			"

												This is one hell of a sequel i tell you that. The story and gameplay are magnificent aswell as the voice acting. Though the sound and the gameplay itself has some bugs. There has been a huge change since AC1 and its not a bad thing (you are more free). The mission are not as challenging as the first game but it makes you more certain that you are going to complete the game, its not like some other games where you get stuck on multiple missions and never get through (dark souls). Anyway this game i worth buying if you are a assassins creed fan or if you just want a game with a great story.			"

												Assassin's Creed II continues where AC1 stopped, Templars are still trying to locate Pieces of Eden using the genetic memories from the Assassin descedant Desmond using the Animus. In ACII you'll play as Ezio Auditore, son of an Assassin from Italy, during the Renaissance and easily the favourite character of most AC fans.Assassin's Creed II is by far the very best of the franchise and it was the game that boosted the popularity of AC series.Pros and cons:Pros: • Ezio Auditore• Amazing story;• Amazing characters;• Amazing scenarios;• Gorgeous robes and armors (seriously, Assassin Robes are wonderful, I wish we'd dress like that today);• Lots of replay value.Cons:• Repetitive gameplay (it's not as bad as AC1 though);• Repetitive combat mechanics;• The mission you need to fly (seriously, that's the only thing that ruin the game).This game did try to make right what AC1 did wrong, and it did in parts.While the game is still a bit repetitive, it's a lot better than AC1 was, you have a little more freedom, you have subtitles, the story is better explained, the characters are better.Overall this game was a huge improvement over AC1.As I said above, this game is easily the best in the franchise and it's the game that made me LOVE Assassin's Creed.

												I just finished the game and I have a very strange feeling about it. I can't stop myself to measure it to the first game. But generally I liked it.First of all, the first class work what the team of the Ubisoft done with places, clothes and conversations is magnificent. It really makes you feel, that you are in the renessaince. The good old fighting system don't make any dissapointment and the guards' AI has got better, there are fast ones who can outrun you and there is inteligent ones, who can find you, and there are more fighting style of them too. And what was a great relief for me, our main character finally can swim. Yeah! It was really annoying that the almost super human assassin drowned in the every little water. The beginning of the story is quite good, it just continues where the first left off. But Ezio won't be my favorite: a spoiled kid at the first and that won't really change untill the last chapters. Altair was a complex character with serious character development. Many times in the conversations, when Ezio tries to think, I just thought 'Oh, man'. But stories' rhythm is quite curious I felt aprox. three-four time a peak, where I got the feeling that the game will end now and... It did not end, it was ok once or twice, but after that it was too much for me. The side quests were interesting and the restauration of Montereggioni Villa was quite a good idea. I really liked and waited when can I pay the last of my money on her. The assassins tombs were a good basic idea to take some dexterity game in the thing, it made the game more diverse. Searching for codex pages and the truth was exciting too, but the glyph puzzles were not balanced, some of it is too easy and some is really hard, and it do not really have a order, that it goes from the easy to the hard.An another thing deserve a word. I think Leonardo is the best sidekick ever. I like his style and he was useful, but did not pamper Ezio. The thing, that we can choose weapons, outfits and even the color of our clothes are convinient, while it let us choose our  fighting style, wether we like heavy or light and fast weapons, it is up to us. And the developing of the handblade season it too.So in summary I liked this game. There were really good ideas, which made interesting side lines for the player. We could explore a little beside the main quest line. But Altair's character is more complex and more interesting than Ezio's. And rhythm of the last chapters were not the just the real thing for me.			"

												Assassin's Creed II adalah lanjutan kisah Desmond setelah kabur dari Abstergo dan memasuki ingatan Ezio Auditore, assassin di jaman Renaissance.Cerita (8/10)Cerita tentang Ezio jauh lebih detail & menarik daripada Altair di AC I. Ceritanya pun lebih seru dengan melibatkan tokoh nyata dalam sejarah seperti Lorenzo De Medici & Leonardo Da Vinci. Adanya subtitle sekarang juga mempermudah pemahaman cerita. Gameplay (9/10)Gameplay yg ditawarkan lebih bervariasi. Bukan hanya menguping, mencopet dan membunuh yg terkesan membosankan di AC I, AC II memberikan banyak mini game sepanjang jalan cerita. Salah satu yang paling menarik adalah terbang ala paralayang dengan alat ciptaan Leonardo Da Vinci.AC II juga membuat Ezio bisa berenang, tidak seperti Altair di AC I yg selalu 'desynchronized' tiap masuk kolam air.Dan yang tidak kalah penting, Ezio punya uang untuk beli armor / senjata, tidak seperti Altair yang terkesan tidak bawa uang sama sekali sepanjang cerita. Grafis (8/10)Perbaikan grafis yang paling terasa adalah adanya adegan sinematik seperti menonton film. NPC dan lingkungan yang ada juga semakin bervariasi & berwarna dibanding AC I yang mungkin terkesan monoton di tiap kota.			"

												I haven't completed it but this game is still amazing. It just gives you new cities to play right when you get bored to the one where you are now. Only bad thing are the controls better than in the first game but still. You need to download Uplay to play this and any ubisoft games, but its worth it.			"

												I played this game last time back in 2009 and I'm having a blast playing it in 2015. The voicing is done so good and I love how they did the facial animations, it's so vivid, disney-like, luuuv it, really adds to the perception of the characters :]And even though I know the plot of the story already, I can't wait to unwind it and get to the part where it suddenly takes you from beeing a hot headed young assasin trying to avenge his family to this whole bigger picture!

												Assassin's Creed II is a major and in-depth step-up from the first game. The nonsensical hack-and-slash has given way to a faster, more controllable and ultimately deadlier combat style. The so called ""stealth"" missions of AC I where you could kill an entire army in the city square and then ""stealthily"" assassinate your target that was covering nearby have given way to a game style where, if you so choose, you can actually play as a stealthy assassin. Guards continue to be impressively stupid and short-sighted but their AI has been increased significantly and they act more reasonably and faster, adding a bit of extra realism. The blending feature, the game economy, the rebuilding of Monteriggioni, the purpose of having something other to do than just kill people all add to the depth of the game.Lastly - I will mention the story. A deep, gripping, emotional story of loss and tragedy, beautifully woven from two brothers contesting in rooftop races to the evolution of a master assassin. You feel like you are fighting for something, that you are connected to the game world and that you want to do anything in your power to keep your family safe and your enemies at bay.Cherries on top - better controls, side missions that are more manageable in size and do not distract from the game and an awesome rendition of major 15th century renaissance Italy cities.

												U see now children before I had my eyes on the one and only Will Smith-Chan I always wished to be ravaged by a dashing Italian gentleman. It was always a dream of mine to have Ezio el' Detorre♥♥♥♥♥to assassinate me, but that I would be able to seduce the fine italian some other way. He would grab my hand in his and we would go to the Sisteenth Chapel. I would lay back staring at the works of the Great Michael Angelo whilst he whispers sweet nothings in my ear. Oh he would penetrate with his blades alright but not the way that he had once planned to. Overall 2/10 passable.			"

 TL:DR at the end, scored 7 / 10 as of 5th July 2016  Full Livestream Playthrough soon!  Borba Recommends Borba likes:Genre - Like its predecessor, Assassin’s Creed II is an open world action adventure, with elements of stealth and a great storyline, this time delving into the memories of a different character.Narrative - In this second major installment in the series, we follow the first of three chapters of Ezio Auditore da Firenze’s story. It contains memorable characters and events that easily surpass the first game’s plot. The present gameplay with Desmond Miles continues as well, and is more interactive and detailed than before, while shedding some light into the cliffhanger ending provided by the first game.Gameplay - Thankfully, there are some improvements for the game’s combat system, including the ability to disarm and take the opponent’s weapon, more assassination moves and a firearm. Navigation is improved with better parkour, and extended with swimming and rowing boats. New hiding methods and the added infamy system are also a fine addition, along with the possibility of purchasing and upgrading the main character’s headquarters to provide a steady flow of income, that may be used to purchase and upgrade equipment and clothing dyes.Interface - Remains simple and functional, with a few added features such as the infamy icon and the currency amount. The mini-map is also reworked, making it easier to read and allowing us to better perceive our surroundings.Graphics - Featuring improved scenery, characters and overall better texture and environment look, the game still looks decent, despite still having a somewhat bland colouring to it.Music - As expected, the music is brilliant and perfectly suited to game’s theme.Sound - Excellent voice work and overall sound effects, including more voice lines and sounds for generic characters than the last game.Borba dislikes:Replayability - Collectives and optional missions are a staple of the series, this time with the introduction of an economy that allows players to invest in shops and the character’s property to increase a periodic income. Currency is also used for upgrades and the purchase of consumables, which is a welcome addition. There are still no achievements, however, and these systems are filler content that will likely only please the completionists and explorers. After finishing the game, we may return to the world if we want to complete any challenge that was left unfinished or just stroll around.Design - Assassin’s Creed II has improved in almost every way, most noticeably in level design with more variation to the locations that are visited throughout the game. The last moments of the game, however, felt too easy and uninspiring, and the lack of challenge in the combat system doesn’t really help justify the grind for upgrades.Polish - There are some occurrences of stuttering due to poor optimization, and also some bugs with combat, horse riding and parkour that could be dismissed if this wasn’t a high production title.Borba feels like there are many improvements all over the board, and plenty of new mechanics and necessary changes from the first title in the series. Assassin’s Creed II is a solid title, and the first of a trilogy ( AC II, Brotherhood, Revelations ) that is considered by many the best story arc in the whole series. It is a highly regarded title in the series, especially if you follow up with the next two games in succession. 7 / 10  "

												It's been a great many years since I've played this game. Much like Pajama Sam and Star Wars, I was very much obsessed with the Assassin's Creed franchise. Don't worry. I haven't turned into a murderous psychopath. Not yet at least.I played most of the Assassin's Creed games multiple times, but I haven't touched II since I first played it. I remember hating it purely for the graphics back in the day, but I'm happy to report that my taste in games has matured. Now let's REALLY find out what I didn't like about this game!To be honest, not a whole lot. Assassin's Creed II is well-justified in being called the best game in the franchise by fans and critics alike. And I mean that as sincerely as I can. It's a pretty enjoyable game.The story continues right off of the first Assassin's Creed (which I might go back and play a third time for sh**s and giggles soon), wherein you play as Desmond Miles as he accesses memories now of Italian ancestor from Renaissance: Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Desmond's story is nearly inexistent, but where the real juice of the the story comes from is found in Ezio.See, Ezio isn't a stone-faced brooding Batman-wannabe like Altair and Connor Kenway were. He was presented like an young man who was thrown into unfortunate circumstances and had to dawn the cowl of the Assassin in order to fulfill his quest for revenge. Ezio is very charismatic and likeable, and you genuinely want to see him follow through with his revenge and become a Master Assassin. A lot of the other characters are pretty forgettable, but the game has so much charm and enough little jokes here and there that I felt entertained throughout the whole experience.Besides the other characters, I did get a little irritated with how one-dimensional the villains were. The only one that really got my interest was the bodyguard, Dante, and he's barely used in the whole game! I felt a bit of rivalry between Ezio and Uberto as well as Vieri, but a lot of the other targest you hunt down are pretty bland. And, of course, the ending with the final target is a bit anti-climactic. But the big reveal afterwards was enough to grab my interest like it had years ago. It's pretty well-implemented, unexpected, and effective in shocking the player at the end of the game.You play as Ezio throughout five sandboxes across Italy: Florence, Tuscany, Forli, Monteriggioni, and Venice. I like that there's a lot of variety in the locations you visit, so the game doesn't become monotonous. When you travel across the country, it really feels like your traveling to brand new locations each completely different from the other places you've visited. However, there are plenty of loading screens whenever you want to travel and animations that mainly pestered me whenever I wanted to take care of some mundane, but it wasn't enough to completely frustrate me.The worlds, while well-designed, are a bit under-utilized. There's A LOT of stuff you can do, but I never felt that motivated to run around and collect little useless sh** thrown randomly across the city or complete mundane taks that are pretty much identical to all the other ones you've completed. In line with the theme of repetition, is the combat. I'm not a fan. You can't break an enemy's defese very easily but you can do the best damage through a counter... which means you have to wait for your opponent to attack you first... which means you'll be doing a lot of waiting in fights. And it's not like fighting is that difficult. Just tap the counter button. That's it.You know? That's probably the biggest flaw with Assassin's Creed II. It's too damn easy. This game was like scraping my knees on pavement when I first played it, but I think I've become a better gamer since then. At least, I'd like to think I have. And so many missions were so simple to figure out and finish in one try that I rushed through the majority of the game in about 15 hours (the other 5 hours was from all the running around in the cities I did). BUT since you're thinking about buying this copy of Assassin's Creed II, you're getting the Deluxe Edition! Woo! Mysterious! What does it mean?You get a couple hour-long memory sequences. Have fun.Okay, they're not that bad honestly. Originally, the game clipped them out as the penultimate chapters of the story and sold them as DLC, but since I played the Deluxe Edition it just skipped right to the DLC missions. I'm not a fan of removing story content for the purpose of making money but if you don't play these DLC packs you're not missing much. I'll give you a summary of both of them: Ezio loses the Apple. Then he gets the Apple back. It's not that inspired, obviously.While the Battle of Forli finally utilized Forli which you only were in for one f***ing mssion in the base game, you have a whole storyline behind Caterina Sforza (who, again, was only in that one out-of-place mission in the original game). A couple twin brothers kidnap her kids, and you have the save them to win the Battle of Forli. It just gives some excuse to pad out the story and add some open combat, which isn't the worst thing ever. I liked Caterina as a character, but the story itself wasn't that compelling.The Bonfire of the Vanities was my favorite chapter of the two. You need to get the Apple back from Savonarola, and to do so you have to assassinate his nine lieutenants across Florence, each with a different twist in how you go about assassinating them. I think Savonarola was a very compelling villain, who was prodded to do what he did because he honestly believe he was doing the right thing by spreading his faith in God to the masses. That and the missions are short enough to justify running around Florence one last time. It was pretty good.Assassin's Creed II isn't the best thing ever. It certainly hasn't aged well in its presentation. Cutscenes look pretty wonky. The characters, when up close, look like the characters from GTA IV. They look all shiny and fake, but their body and facial animations are actually really well-done. If you want this game to look better, either buy the Ezio Collection like the dirty console peasant you are, or just download some graphical mods. It's not terrible. The game hasn't aged that well.That being said, the atmosphere of the cities you explore are wonderful. Even though the graphics aren't that great up-close, they look marvelous when you're running around 1400's Italy, and listening to the chatter of passing pedestrians, hearing the howls of the local herald, and listening to the gorgeous soundtrack by Jesper Kyd. It's not the best soundtrack ever, but the main theme of this game and the ambient songs in Venice are some fantastic songs he wrote. This game still looks decent, but it sounds even better.Like I said, Assassin's Creed II is pretty damn good upon my second playthrough. I don't think if I ever reinstall this game, that I'll go around and do all asinine side-mission B.S. but I'm certainly inclined to play through the story again. It's a decent game, despite its flaws and one of the best games in the Assassin's Creed franchise. I'm giving Assassin's Creed II a 7/10.			"

""Oh no! Not another buggy, lame and boring Assassin's Creed""This is what most of us think when we see another game of this series.But beware!Assassin's Creed was not always a repetitive cash machine but actually had something like a soul. While Ubisoft tried something new with the first AC (ah, those times, when big publishers had nuts), it resulted in being a well-designed game with a great lore which also had its flaws like a kinda repetitive mission design. Well even Patrice Désilets (bare that name in mind), the godfather of AC, had to find the true heart of his project and so he did with the second instalment of the series:Assassin's Creed II plays during the Renaissance of the lovely Italy. You will visit the landscapes of the beautiful Toscana, enjoy a ride through the canals of Venice or take a walk through the charming Florence while you'll be full of respect for the masterworks of architecture. But Assassin's Creed II is more than a wonderful sightseeing tour but an intruding story about a young and very charming Italian Ezio Auditore Da Firenze who undergoes a drastic and lossy stroke of fate and yearns for justice, orientation and help. Eventually, he finds himself in a corrupted society full of intrigues and greed for power and is confronted by a man, who will later burn his name in the pages of history: Rodriguez Borgia. In all this chaos Ezio becomes recruited by the Assassins and will be entangled in the ongoing war between Assassins and Templars.This complex story and the wonderful sightseeing tour (which I can indulge in for hours although the graphic is by far not as beautiful as present games but still beautiful though) is completed by a wonderful soundtrack composed by Jesper Kyd who was so enthralled with the project, that the developers immediately let him do whatever he wanted.If you listen to interviews of Jesper Kyd or even more of Patrice Désilets, you will find exactly what you’ll feel in the game: they were emotionally involved. It was not about another cash-grab or a milestone for their career. It was their very own vision. I mean, look at Patrice Désilets commenting on Assassin’s Creed II[ https] and how he goes into all the details, how he even remembers the dialogue. And since he left during the preproduction of Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood, this may be the last game with such an emotional touch. After this one, Assassin’s Creed had to become “huuuuge”. Which means stupid, uninspiring and sensationalistic and its heart got sick like a child you don’t care for anymore.So let's indulge in this wonderful gem, that's far from perfect but heartwarming as well as intriguing.

												It’s a lot better game than AC1, but it’s still one of the 5 most frustrating games I’ve ever played. I’ve punched my desk and cursed like a sailor – Ezio tends to make stupid things occasionally, with tragic effect. 7/10 for me + beautiful cities full of activities+ plot of the game connected to history+ shops with armors, weapons and all kinds of stuff+ medicine to stock+ autosaves in the middle of the missions+ better control on protagonist than in AC1 – he’s not a block of wood now+ soundtrack in general+ you can run and kill all those stupid archers+ Ezio+ better free-running than in AC1…- …but still Ezio sometimes decides to do some idiotic things like jump all the way down when you’re in the middle of the platform sequence- this one ♥♥♥♥ing song (named The Vault) - I've rushed through most of the game, until I had to collect codex pages, then I stopped and decided to make all sidequests, viewpoints etc., my main quest at that moment was ""collect codex pages"" and I guess creators of the game connected that one song to this quest and I had to listen to THIS ♥♥♥♥ING SONG for 15 hours, over and over again, with little brakes- all Italians speaking English with some Italian words, it seems so false and unnatural that keeps you from feeling like this is more than just a stupid game (acctualy it just screams “I’m just a stupid game” all the time), ruins immersion- the whole animus idea- Desmond- no difficulty settings- stupid weapon change system (in villa)- “I just killed you, let’s have a long conversation”- can’t skip cutscenes (even when watched 2nd time and even when it comes to Villa cutscenes, like with Da Vinci)- frustrating fighting system (you can win all fights just by pressing X repeatedly)- you are taught about all these fighting techniques (counter-attack, dodge, disarm etc.) but when it comes to the battle and when 5 people attacks you in the same time, you have no chance of remembering about some stupid disarm- interacting with things while chasing people- posters of Ezio placed on towers, high buildings – who the hell looks there?!- hilarious cutscenes with paralyzed protagonist:1. execution of Auditore family – Ezio just stands there for 1 minute and does nothing, he would have made it on time to save them without a problem – I understand that this is a part of a plot, but it’s just made wrong2. templars attack on medici – vieri’s father slashes his targets, attacks Lorenzo and Ezio is completely paralyzed while standing 5m from him, unable to do anything, save anyone, assassinate Francesco de’ Pazzi "

Get this game first before you buy Assassins Creed: Brotherhood, otherwise the story will not make much sense. Get Assassins Creed 2.			"

												This is an amazing game. In many aspects it is better then the first Assassin's Creed.Pros:- Captivating story. Although you can sense a little bit of what might be coming, I was still amazed that they went full blast on that concept. - Not as repetitive as AC 1.- Great graphics, and environment in general. History lives and breaths in this game. From music, through architecture, details and famous and fabulous painting. Even weaponry of the era. - Eagle vision is useful!- Interesting characters. - Decent length of game play.Cons (not many):- Combat is very similar to one from the original game. Can feel clumsy a bit sometimes. - Although you have a wide variety of weapons to chose from, I hardly ever used throwing knives (unlike AC 1) or felt necessity to use short blade (unlike AC 1 again).- From time to time you might get irritated when camera's twists and turns mess up your jumping or other acrobatics. - Although far less bugs happened, I've captivated pretty hilarious one. In Venice you may encounter legions of guards on one tiny bit of rooftop. Out of the sudden. They just HAPPENED there. The more you killed trying to clear out the area, the more would pop up in their sted. Creepy. Apart from that, the game is one of the rarer kinds when you have a blast playing and can learn some history. This is of great value as well, and AC series so far has been also educative. I know I'll be fishing for other titles of AC now. Yeah, I've heard the rumours about meh protagonist in AC III but... I must yet get disappointed by any game of the series. So far so good.Recommended! "

												Assassin's Creed 2 was my favorite of the series. It introduced a dynamic, exciting new assassin in Ezio, the gameplay from the first game was much improved and the story was less repetitive. The game introduced a lot of new mechanics, such as money, building up your own Assassin base, bombs, hidden firearms, double blades, all kinds of things! It was a fresh new experience from the rinse and repeat gameplay of AC1.AC2's biggest flaw was its ending, which ended up being really dragged out and repetitive. AC2 also still suffered from the control issues from the first game with Ezio randomly jumping off of or getting stuck on various things while climbing or doing parkour. While these created some frustration they didn't take away from the overall game.If you are new to the AC franchise, I would recommend starting with AC2. Altair wasn't that great of a character and the gameplay of the first game was repetitive and boring. AC really begins to be its own unique game in AC2 and you start with a long, expansive story with Ezio spanning 3 games. This game provides hours of entertainment and lets you experience Renaissance Italy in a unique way.			"

I'm running this on a GTX 970 and there were frequent FPS dips. Uplay is not as bad as it once was. It's still annoying that I have to use two clients to run the game, though.			"

												The best in the series. Assassin's Creed II takes the idea of the original and turns it into a very good game. There are a lot of ways to dispatch enemies. A lot of collectibles and great areas to explore. The graphical leap from 1 to 2 isn't gigantic, but it's the totally different, yet awesome atmosphere that makes this the definitive Assassin's Creed game. Did I mention the story is great? What I find great is that you're dealing with 2 stories at the same time; Ezio Auditore's story and Desmond Miles' story outside the Animus. A lot of people find these sections boring and un-interesting, but I find it the most intruiging part of the entire series.The game has a lot to offer and is thé must play of the AC-franchise.			"

												This is the first Assassin's Creed that I've played. I recommend this game, it's a good game with a very good story.I began with Asssassin's Creed 2 because before buying I toke a look at the forum of the game, and saw several reviews about  Assassin's Creed ""1"", and several people say the game is very good but with a lot of repeatitivy missions, and can be boring after some hours of gameplay. In the other side, I read good reviews about AC2, then I did a option to take Assassin's Creed 2, Brotherhood and Revelations, and with it get a game and two after with the same protagonist, Ezio. I bought the games during a steam sale, and thought good to take 3 games at same time with a good price.At this time when I write this review, I have finished AC2 and started Brotherhood yesterday.Well, it's an amazing game with amazing story, I really like the game and sure recommend it.Pros:* Amazing story, based on Italy near 1490, 1500. * Some historical persons like Leonardo da Vinci, Machiavel, and others.* Good mechanical of fights, with a variety of weapons, swords, and the hidden blade \m/* Good side missions, some timely chalenged, some stealth. I didn't get bored with them.* Several hours of gameplay.* The evolve of habilities in fight and parkour during the game.Cons:* The 3rd person view sometimes sucks. Sometimes the camera changes, you didn't view the back of your person, view by the side, the controls change too. Sometimes it sucks a lot to do right directional jumps, and sometimes when a jump is wrong you need to return and restart the mission from the beginning, very anoying. Fortunatelly this type of problems begin when you are at +-80% of the game.* Because last explained, some missions is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to finish. Imagine like you play for 5 or 6 hours just to finish a mission with 5 minutes of duration. And when you go youtube for help, you see other players saying the same: some anoying missions are really very, very anoying.* The mechanism of stealth in this game seems some broke. I had played Far Cry 3 some time before, I really like stealth way of play, and in Far Cry 3 the AI and stealth works very better.* The way the game shows controls during the game: the game don't show the keys (like E, shift, button 2, space), and instead shows icons related to the actions. Not a big problem, but take some time playing to fixing in mind these associations. I noticed it is better on Brotherhood that shows the keys instead of icons. A tip: I swap right mouse button with shift key, I think is better to run by holding the shift key (like in Battlefield, Call of Duty and other games) instead of holding mouse button.* Uplay DRM. It's not really a cons for me, fortunatelly I didn't get problem with uplay, but several people don't like uplay.			"

												Assassin's Creed II is an open-world Third Person Action/Stealth game that takes place in Renaissance Italy. You play as Ezio Auditore, an Italian noble, as he seeks to gain revenge on his enemies and further the causes of his faction, the Assassins. Much like the first game, gameplay is split between modern times where you play as Desmond (and not a whole lot happens), and historic times which is where the majority of gameplay takes place.The game is vastly superior to the first in the series, expanding on nearly every single area - collectables are still present but are not so meaningless, there's an economy of sorts, the missions are not as repetitive, and the combat has been opened up some. However, with the combat becoming more accessible, being stealthy/unnoticed is no longer as important - the game has taken a serious step in the direction of more action game than ""assassination,"" a trend which continues throughout the series (but which in many ways improves it for how most people would like to play).I played and beat this game on the 360, hence my play time, and I highly recommend it.Note: This game is excluded from Steam's Family Sharing service, and it requires the use of Ubisoft's Uplay program. If either of those bother you, then I would avoid this game.			"

												Considering this game is quite a few years old now, I'm probably looking at this from a different perspective than most. But in Summary, it's a good, almost great port for PC.First the Good:This game's graphics have aged pretty well. Not totally, but enough where it ever bothered me. I understand the time it came from, so just have an open mind if you've never played this game before. It's more colorful than the first game. Textures and models still look good. Character models are a little dated but not too bad.There is plenty of content, most of which is compelling and/or fun enough to actually bother with. You can do anything from races to assassination contracts to collecting feathers to even flying with Da Vinci's invention just for fun. You can look for hidden loot, do the assassin's tomb side quests (which are great fun and grant you Altair's armor after you do all six), to courier missions, to taking down thieves and runners. The main story is very interesting, and you start out, once you're in the Animus, as Ezio as a baby, so you practically see Ezio's entire life unfold. The story is more character driven than paying attention to the big picture, which really isn't at the forefront until almost near the end of the game. You'll go to many different historic locations in Italy as the story unfolds. The game difficulty is relatively easy, so it's accessible to new Gamers. It never felt overly easy where I felt bored, though, and by the end of the game it brought on a decent challenge, as it brings about everything you've learned and gained to full circle. The AI is also decently balanced and well programmed with some exceptions, as when in need to be stealthy, they won't unfairly spot you... most of the time. Now the Bad:The controller input was a huge pain to set up. It's weird really, it recognized that I was using an XBox One controller (literally, it didn't think it was a 360 controller) but inputs are read as ""Button 1, Button 2, etc."" So they were a pain to set and often I had to go back and change them because they still felt uncomfortable. The controls in the HUD are also not identified as ""A, B, X, Y, etc."" instead they are identified as symbols, which gets very confusing until you use them after a few hours and commit them to memory. On top of that, the camera can screw up a jump incredibly easily, or if Ezio isn't positioned right at times he'll jump in the complete opposite direction you wanted him too and either die, get found, or lose a lot of health. This got annoying but not to the point where I wanted to stop playing.Also... Uplay. This is a negative because of how weird it acts. A few times Uplay crashed on me, sometimes it wouldn't start up the game, other times it actually froze my computer. Also it's mandatory to have it run to play this game. Now the (not so) bad:This is almost like a feature (The series as a whole is known for their glitches), but there are glitches galore, but never to the point of game breaking and usually they end up being really funny. The AI will push each other, sometimes dead bodies spaz out, at one point my target accidentally killed itself, etc. Sometimes it ended up costing me, like there is some collision detection issues when assassinating guards on the edge of a roof, but sometimes I would end up having them stuck in the wall with their legs hanging out, so I got a good laugh from that.All in All I highly recommend this if you missed out, as you're in for a real treat. Returning players who lost/sold their console versions can have this as a good alternative if they have a moderately decent computer, even if they may have trouble setting up the controls on a gamepad.

I originally made the ""review"" above when I had only a few hours of game time.I'm going to say it right now, this is probably my favorite game in the series, or at least top two, as of August 9th, 2014.To start off, the story of Assassin's Creed 2 is above and beyond what I would have expected after playing the first game. It's not just a linear ""go kill this person and come back"" type of story this time around. There are genuine reasons for killing the people you kill, the cutscenes have many, many times more emotion than in the first game, and the voice acting is superb. In the first game, Altair's voice is monotone the whole way through. You could chalk this up to his serious personality, but if you have ever played games showcasing Altair later, such as in Revelations, you'll know this is not the case. It shows that Ubisoft really put many more hours of effort into making the story in Assassin's Creed II the best it could possibly be.Now, as far as content goes, the overall content in Assassin's Creed I can be smushed into 15 hours at max, and 8-9 hours if you just play the story. However, as you can see, I have 50+ hours in Assassin's Creed II as of the time this review is being written. I have replayed the game once now, but many hours were spent dicking around in the unique environment that is Renaissance Italy. There are endless possibilities for things to do in Assassin's Creed II, even after finishing the story. The best part is though, that even after finishing the game, I can start a new game and not be bored. That's the beauty of this game to me, and all of the Assassin's Creed games really.Overall, this game is worth the money twice over, and if you're thinking about buying it, you really should. I can honestly say that you'll have a hard time regretting it if you give it a chance.			"

												+Setting.Renaissance Italy is much more beautiful and interesting than medieval Middle East.Florence,Venice,Toscana.+Soundtrack.Jesper Kyd done a good job.""Ezio's Family"" still one of the best tracks in whole series.+Improved fight system.More weapons to use,more moves to do.+Economy system.Rebuilding Monteriggioni and buying stuff was fun.+Improved parkour.Much better than AC1 but still not so good as Brotherhood.+Collectibles.Founding seales,feathers,statuettes and glyphs was more interesting than collecting flags in AC1.Cause there is reward for this.+Characters.There was few remarkable characters in AC1.But in AC2 there is dozens of them.-Dialogues with templars.When you killed templar in AC1 it was really interesting to hear dialogue between Altair and his prey.You started to think what you dont want to kill this man,what maybe templars are good guys.There is no such thing in AC2.-Parkour sometimes goes crazy.I want jump straight.Ezio jumps left.Frustrating sometimes.-Obvious war of two secret organizations.You know,Assassins and Templars are two secret brotherhoods fighting with each other.But AC2 made it looks like open war,like there is no conspiration.Everyone knows about assassins and templars.Everyone is assassins or templar.This is just stupid.-Ezio's outfit.Altair outfit perfectly fited the setting.Cause it was really noteless.But in AC2 setting this looks like a joke.Assassins outfit looks too noticeable.

												I have mixed feelings really, so I am not sure where to start with this game. The beginning is probably the logical answer to that. Ok so, I have never played the first one. They all went on sale some time last year, and I got from AC2 to AC4 for like 23 British Pounds, it was great. Like an idiot, I forgot about the first Assassins Creed. This wasn't a problem until some smart ♥♥♥♥ from school told me they all follow a story which is intertwined in all of the games. By which time I had already got further in Assassins Creed Black Flag that any of its predecessors. As you can tell, I was off to a good start. That aside, I vowed to myself not to play ANY Assassins Creed games until I finished them in order, which is a pain because I hate the era of Assassin's Creed 2. Well, to the review I guess, I have rambled enough. I can't remember the dates, and I can't be bothered to look it up for the sake of the review. We can make it a little interactive review, look it up yourself :) (Here: https://www.google.co.uk/ ) Let's settle with 1400 and cabbage, that's a start. Assassin's Creed is set in an era before guns, which is enough for me, it put me right off. You play as an Assassin. His name is Ezio (Microsoft word thinks it’s Elliot), god alone knows how you actually spell that. Much like all other games in this franchise, you are taken on quite an interesting story to uncover mythical Assassin and Templar secrets from the forgotten past. It sounds really exciting doesn't it?I can't give this game a 'no' because the game itself is pretty good. I just don't like it. It is well made, and the graphics are horrible. I understand it's old, but they do make me cringe a bit. The accents on the speech are horrible, no offence to Italian people, you don't all sound that bad. The gameplay is like all other assassins creed games, where the missions are often rather over complicated and you have to parkour everywhere and lunge on people and kill them. They have everything they need, they ought to make a parkour simulator, really, it's a hidden talent. The story itself is quite repetitive, though it is good. There is a lot of 'kill a bunch of enemies and then do it again and again and again' and it gets BORING, but hey. 8/10. I cannot fault the game without being an idiot. It is a good game; I just don't like it. A lot of time went into it, and for its age it is quite impressive. I have to re-enforce though, that I hate that era. Black Flag is my favourite so far, though Assassin's Creed III does look brilliant too.P.S. You wouldn't believe how may times I had to edit this...all the typos I made. I must have read it like 10 times now. Might as well rate it now I am here			"

												This game is a pain on Mac. From the default setting of 800x600 that makes launching the first time a headache, it also fails to recognise most keyboards on Yosemite (and, I've heard, many earlier versions of OSX.) Marketing this game as playable on Mac is infuriatingly obtuse and quite frankly inaccurate in the extreme. I'll continue searching for a fix for the keyboard issue but as of yet, I haven't managed to get past ""Desmond, we need to go!"" because I can't move.			"

												This game is fantastic and I mean fantastic... for it's story.  The gameplay is redundant, sticky, glitchy as a pre alpha.  I haven't played the console version in awhile but from what I remember these glitches were mostly nonexistent.  Ubisoft seemed to accidently put the alpha on steam or something.  Not to mention to use a controler (which you pretty much have to considering the controls are about as good as playing it with a potato) are almost impossible to map out I had to download some sketchy .ini files of the internet just to get the game to work.  Ezio never seems to do what I tell him to do when I click buttons and the parkour never works I've found walking gets me places easier.  I'm a PC gamer and this is the only time I'd say go buy the console version. Worst PC port of all time.  Do not buy on PC unplayable.			"

												I'm not usually one to complain about DRM or write reviews, but avoid paying for this game - no, all ubisoft games - because of the particular DRM system they use for activation.I changed my email address for the ""uplay service"" (which is a nightmare in itself, need to request via support and wait a few weeks for them to pull the thumb out) and after that the cd key will no longer activate when reinstalling the game as it claims to be registered to another email address. I'm pretty annoyed at their support who have not even contacted me back after several days waiting.Game itself is fine, get a torrent version instead of buying though and save yourself the headache of dealing with this kind of game-breaking DRM. It's one of those situations where the paying customer gets the worst available version of the product.Edit: Several YEARS later and still no response from ubisoft support. Worse still steam refuse to remove this game from my library - so even if I wanted to take it up the♥♥♥♥♥♥and pay for it a second time this isn't possible without creating a new steam account. What a joke, except I don't find it very funny since it's at my expense.			"

												Straight from the depths of Rennaissance-era Italy, Ubisoft brings us the second, and by far best to date, entry to the Assassin's Creed franchise.  This is a game about options, usually.  Most of the game allows the player to roam freely and choose to complete the game in either a stealthy manner or an openly violent and crazy manner.  The mechanics are good through most of the game, though there are moments where the game tends to cause issues like having trouble seeing or reaching objectives.  Ironically, most of these problems arise during a sequence in which you play as Altair from AC1.Overall, though, the game works.  I give it 4/5 Florins for being mostly functional and fun, despite a few gameplay issues.			"

I did get to play it  a few months ago and it seemed okay and I have generally tested games from Steam to comply with the return rules if the game doesn't work but now, I can access it at all .Maybe I'll try one of the later games when I've calmed down about it all......

I am a player who loves a good story and this series has epic story to tell.Ezio was not really sympathetic to me in his early age, but his character was developed and shown troughout years. 20 years later he was totally different man.In terms of gameplay everything that I didn't like in previous game was fixed or improved. You have more options how to hide in crowd and draw guards away. Improved battle techniques, my favorite so far is disarming enemy and killing him with his own weapon.Edit: I almost forgot the swimming! ♥♥♥♥ yeah! No more dying from water... not mentioning how cool it looks when you jump from high altitude.And if you want to stay in this world a little longer, they added a ton of stuff to do except the main story! You can raid tombs for Altair armor, collect feathers all over the map for a cape that makes everyone want to kill you, or find strange glyphs and solve their puzzles to unlock a video that nobody understands!There is now also money aspect, you make money by completing memories, you upgrade your own town to make even more money and then you can buy upgrades, better weapons, refill knives, ...Only ONE thing that really bothered at the beginning: the controls are marked by some stupid icons that say nothing at all... everytime I had to look at settings what icon is what key until i got used to the controls...Totally recommending this game... and don't forget to play first AC as well to have the story complete.

												Very fun game!The controls can be a bit hard to get used to at first (if you haven't played much of AC1). For the most part, the movement is fluid, but a few times Ezio got stuck or made a weird decision to leap off the side of a building for no reason...Much better than what I glimpse from the 1 hour or so I've played of AC1, though the combat is still quite slow and focuses on counter-attacks.Campaign does look to be about 20 hours long, though if you do all the side missions and object hunts, it might push 35 hours. However, don't make my mistake and try looking for all the treasures BEFORE finishing the campaign, because that really make you tired :PBiggest complaint I have is that, for an assassin, Ezio is too strong in normal combat. Sure, he should be good, but there really is no incentive for staying in cover, except that it doesn't waste your time. I'd like to see battles that I know I will lose if I fight, but right now a 1v8 fight is actually a 1v1 fight 8 times.			"

												This truly is a worthy successor to Altaïr's story. The environment, particularly the cities, are lively, there is a lot more to do, from objectives, to interaction, to managing an entire city. While the ""collecting this to achieve that"" is still there, the overall dynamic is increased a lot. References to the first game are made, and I would definitely suggest playing them in order.I think you can best compare this to the improvements made from GTA III over Vice City to San Andreas. Everything got bigger, more detailed, and more refined. It takes a little getting used to the new fighting style, and I could have done without the ""swoosh visuals"" of hack'n'slash games, but hey, the additions, including an enemy's health status, are worth it. You certainly don't have to complete every single ""grind"" quest anymore, although you most likely will anyway.Money plays a big role, because you can aquire upgrades and other items with it, bribe people etc. Citizens and guards react to your actions, and you, in return, have to take steps to make yourself less known. On top of that you will meet well known historical figures, even befriend them and enlist their help! If you liked the first Assassin's Creed, even a little bit, you will not be disappointed by this one!			"

												The main thing in this game is its scenario base: all major history events turn out an endless fight between assassins and templars for so called “Pieces of Eden”. Conspiracy, brutal violence, religious in its true shape, famous people in alternative reality — all runs through the entire game captivating till you see final credits. And, of course, it's all would be nothing without a good gameplay, where you run on the city roofs of Florence, Venice, Forli and Tuscany, killing guards with variety of weapons combining them. And yes — the game is freaking long.			"

												Assassin's Creed 2 is worth every penny, dime, nickel, quarter, dollar, really anything money-wise. This Assassin's Creed is without doubt the best in the series. ""How so?"" you may ask. Well, let me answer that question for you.Assassin's Creed 2 starts in Florence, Italy, a truly beautiful city. You play the character of Ezio Auditore de Firenze. As you begin, you are just a young Italian noble, but you'll soon learn a family secret, and become the most deadly and awesome assassin that there ever was. When Ezio learns of his past, he sets out to assassinate other men who were conspirators against his family. Along the way, you'll travel to several different cities (Venezia, Tuscany, Forli, Monteriggioni, Florence) and explore them, assassinating the men you're after and even make new friends. The game really outdoes itself with it's amazing soundtrack. Listening to it makes you feel like an assassin just like Ezio, but you'll never be as cool nor as good as he is. There are miles and miles worth of city to track and explore. There's also several unique assassination techniques that are extremely satisfying to pull off. As you complete missions, you will earn yourself some cash and be able to buy better armor and weaponry. The weaponry is also very interesting indeed. You can use smokebombs to make quick getaways. Throwing knives to kill those pesky archers on rooftops, use poison on one of your enemies by injecting them with it via your hidden blade. You can also use a neat little gun attachment on your arm, which is extremely useful for making assassinations quick and sword-free.One of the best things is the combat system. When you're engaged in hand-to-hand combat, you can dodge, taunt, and perform epic killmoves. Are you one that likes to use swords, daggers, or even your fists? Then you'll enjoy the combat system very much. Another thing that the game executes very well is in the ""free run"" system. This running system allows you to climb onto objects and get onto rooftops and perform some very darn good parkour. But if there is but on reason to play this game, it is the storyline. The great voice acting and fun and touching storyline are what make or break games. But Assassin's Creed 2 has done that very, very well. If you are one who enjoy the Assassin's Creed series, or even if you're someone who has never heard of it yet, you should definitely pick the game up. You'll enjoy amazingly detailed cities, great combat, amazing story, and an overall satisfyingly spectacular experience. 9/10			"

												This game was quite good. The gameplay was fun and enjoyable and the graphics were alright speaking for a game that was made a couple of years ago and was not in with the cool new advances in technology. However, with everything said I have a couple of problems with this:1: The free-running was not always responsive and sometimes I run straight off in the other direction making me seeth with rage and no longer willing to play for the next 30-60 minutes.2: The requirement to have a U-Play account was seriously stupid and annoying because for some reason the launcher always crashes now whenever I put in my log-in information.3: You need internet to play this game, you can't play it on the rode like plenty of other games which is also because of U-playSo all-in-all this game is excellent, I would reccomend it to everyone who I know.P.S Does anyone else have that glich where the launcher keeps crashing whenever you try to log-in?

												ProsAmazing large world to play in. Excellent story: unlike previous game player takes on main protagonist from the beginning of its assassin's livelihood and purpose. The story has lots of humor to it, keeps thing fresh through the game.Better Combat system from previous gameVisually impressive for its timeGame runs smooth.Plenty to do, side missions are fun, big variety in assassination missions.ConsUbisoft DRMBad controls, game does not give any indication of hotkey during the game, have to go to menu to look them up, It assumes game runs with xbox controller, definitely bad port. Game map is lagging, no idea why.  "

												AC2 is more of an interactive history lesson than just a game, optional as it may be. If the history interests you it's there in large amounts and you will likely learn a lot along the way. That aside the game is fluid and easy to enjoy. It's only downfall is that a Uplay account and a login is required, painful if you prefer single-player games and aren't always connected to the internet. I'd still give it 5 stars out of 5 especially for the price. Controller recommended but by no means required.			"

PROS:+ awesome and long story+ cool mix between historical settings and Animus UI+ huge maps (five cities + extra areas)+ horse riding+ assassination missions+ smooth combat with impressive combos+ weapon selection including a gun mounted on the wristCONS:- uPlay- funky AI behavior from time to time- sometimes a bit repetitive guard fighting- occassional graphical glitches- not great video card optimization- audio can go out of sync in very rare occassionsComment:We leave Altair from the previous game to start a new adventure with Ezio. This game is a real upgrade from the first AC. The developers at Ubisoft listened to what people had to say about their first game in this franchise and created this unique and spectacular game! Basically all areas have been improved. AC2 take you for a ride with the really good (and rather long) storyline where Ezio evolves from a boy to a man ... and in the end to an ultimate assassin. The game is fun, it has lots of side missions and collectibles as well. Never have I found a dull moment in this game. The combat is smooth and apart from the generic guard fighting it is not at all repetitive. Main assassinations are great and fun, each playing out a bit differently to mix things up a bit. Again I also applaud the Desmond timeline although so many people do not like it I think it fits perfectly into the game. Of course there are drawbacks to this game. One being a sometimes funky AI for both allies and enemies. But the main flaw is in this case uPlay. This was the first game to implement it and back then it was a disaster. Today it is better but still far from good because starting the game on Steam just launches uPlay and THEN you can start your game. So you need a uPlay account. Otherwise the game itself is fantastic and takes you on a journey through renaissance Italy where you will adore both the story and the visuals. I know I did. Recommended!			"

												Way better than AC1.  In fact, I can't really think of another sequel that improves more on the original than this one.  Whereas AC1 had you repeating the same types of missions over and over, AC2 has a huge variety of missions right up to the end.  Likewise, combat also has more variety with upgradeable armor, weapons, and home bases giving the gameplay a tiny bit more depth.  But perhaps best of all, while AC1's plot was silly, AC2's plot takes things to a level of complete insanity that is kind of charming in its own unintentionally absurd bat♥♥♥♥♥♥way.  I can't think of another game, for example, that let's you storm a medieval castle, beat up a pope, and (mild spoilers) hob-knob with alien beings all in the space of a few minutes and all with a completely straight face. It's pure, pulp-video-game, guilty pleasure, trash--but in a good way!  Mindless fun.			"

												Assassin's Creed... some call it the CoD of open world games, some call it repetitive yearly crap and some call it The Best Game Evar!!1! Going to say this now, I like the franchise of Assassin's Creed, but not as much as I used too. I was a fanboy of the games, I admit. I thought every game in the series were the best things ever. But now I've become more ""wise"" with my games and such and I don't think they are the best games ever, but more a guilty pleasure.... Assassin's Creed II is a direct sequel of Assassin's Creed. It's a story driven open world game with some social stealth elements and lots of combat. As for the story (what AC is knowned for), AC II is good, an improvement over AC I. But like many other games, it felt rushed towards the end and has a ♥♥♥♥ing sequel bait (like we need more). It has interesting characters (not the best, but interesting) and one of the few games were I actually like the main character. Ezio Auditore da Firenze, an Italian plumb--playboy, rich, cocky and charismatic lovable man. I love him and so do a lot of people. How does the gameplay hold up? Well it's an improvement over the first game, that is for sure. It follows the same logic, you're an Assassin, here's a contract, now go stab the guy. It is less repetitive than the first instalement. Now you have even more side quests to do, all kinda repetitive, but the Assassination Contracts are always a yes in my book for an Assassin's Creed game. The side quests are either go deliver mail (you are a banker that delivers stuff at the start of the game); beat up a man for cheating on his wife; assassinate a Templar (enemy of the Assassin) assossiate or you race someone across the map. The combat has become easier, now instead of waiting and countering everyone, you can wait, counter and shoot them! I swear, every installement of AC makes you have more and more weapons to use, it's too much for me. The game is really easy, a little too easy at points. You can purchase better weapons and armor in the game with money (trust me, you will have way too much cash), which makes the game easier. Is the world good? Yes, you have more places to go to than AC 1 and you go to Venezia, I love Italy and I want to give AC II a big kiss for placing this game there. The game did not age well compared to the other instalements. It still sort of look good to me, but it is poorly executed at times, it's laughable at points (i.e right after you get hidden blades, the scene makes me laugh every time how bad it is). The stealth in the game is different from the first game, and it's better. You can blend in crowds instead of praying everywhere you go. The more ""bad"" actions you do, the more the guards will notice you etc... Is it the best game in the series, I do not know. I don't know which one I prefer, Assassin's Creed II or Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. AC II is more an AC game, but I did spend over 600 hours into ACB on xbox... In the end, it's a really good game, I like it a lot. But it is not the ""best game ever"" I thought it was. Good story, good world, easy but fun combat and it has Ezio, can't argue on that. I give it a 8.5/10			"

												Assassin's Creed II took what was flawed in the first installment in this series and corrected it, plus adding a ton of new content and a less monotonous gameplay. The story is probably still the most fascinating and awesome in the series, and so is the setting. I am italian, so seeing the historical sights of my country in this game is even better than it already would be for others. The main character is generally considered the most interesting protagonist in the series, and for a whole bunch of good reasons. The gameplay has its highs and lows: parkour is sometimes broken and combat is kinda boring and waaaaay too easy to put up a real challenge. And yet, this game manages to be a vast, varied, interesting, fun to play open world that has enstablished a very high standard for the series, a standard it did not always live up to. Brotherhood may be more refined, AC III may possess a (way) better graphic and technology, AC IV may have an overly awesome pirate setting with sailing and stuff, but this is still the episode that stays in my heart, and one of the last where the plot still made mostly sense. If you love this series but have only played the recent installments, buy this one ASAP.			"

												Deluxe Edition of the continious series of Assassin's Creed start with a misteryous adventuer and womanizer Ezio in Florence. The game includes treatchery, romance, open-world gameplay and stealth (that is a signature in Assassin's Creed series.)I recommed this game to be played with a controller, on the keyboard you can only press 3 buttons at the same time - in this game u'll need more then that.

												The seamlessness of the parkour and, to a lesser extent, combat flow (both from the first game) is revolutionary in its own way. The animation is plenty enough to get excited about, and parkour chase/escape scenes work especially well, letting you focus on where you want to go and the method of your escape, whilst the execution of jumps, turns and climbs is mostly automated. Turn off the minimap. Instead, bring up the full map when you get a new objective, then follow the streets, landmarks, and your sense of direction, to find the target, and your camera to search for guards. Make yourself be drawn into the beautiful recreations of beautiful cities, the colours, the changing atmospheres, the rich environmental soundscape enhancing with understated music, and you might just fall in love with this game.

												I had played the first Assassin's Creed on XBox and I  was very hesitant to be playing the second one on the pc, since every one said it was a bad port. I was pleasantly surprised. It controlled alright, there weren't as many bugs as I expected and I was able to play through the whole game without having and gamebreaking glitches.As far as the game goes, it is a massive improvement over the first one. Huge open world with lots of things to do. That being said, a lot of side quests do not serve any purpose other than being fetch quests. Yeah I can collect 100 feathers but why should I? There is no cool weapon or peice of armor at the end of it. At least the tomb missions give you a nice suit of armor at the end. The codex pages also allow you to learn some new skills, as well as being necessary for finishing the game. But the feathers, templar tombs, truth scans, and picture and treasure collection is just to make your villa look better.I am also getting tired of the climb a high place to reveal map thing that Ubisoft games keep doing, even though AC are the first few games to do so.If you are looking to play a nice long adventure game that has the feel of tomb raider and prince of persia then I highly recommend this game.

More interesting than ever.Up to every detail the game is awesome.Recommended for sure!			"

												I can recommend this game despite the fact I had to spend fifteen minutes fighting Uplay just so it wouldn't crash, that's really great praise right there. But do not fear, oh reader, once you properly install it the game runs smoothly, at least it did for me.After the stunt with Uplay I was ready to growl, complain and call it quits, and yet this classic deserves all the praise it gets and once I started playing I couldn't stop.The controls on pc, with mouse and keyboard, were kinda weird at first for me. But then I started liking the sassy main character and learnt to jump from roof to roof without falling on top of innocent bystanders, and things improved. The story is compelling, Ezio is charismatic, the gameplay makes you feel like you can do parkour in real life. Even collectings things all over the cities wasn't boring because the landscapes and atmosphere are quite immersive.I loved it, and that's coming from someone who was ready to dismiss it because Uplay sucks and I'm quite skeptical of things that turn into long sagas. Now I feel like some of the ramdon NPCs, who stare at Ezio in wonder while he climbs a cathedral and mutter things like ""Santa Madre di Dio!"" or ""I should find a way to stay in shape too"". Yeah. Go buy it.			"

The cities are full of different buildings to climb, varied roofs to free-run across, and guards to dual air assassinate (a great new gameplay feature). The story is a fantastic emotional tale featuring an immediately likeable hero. It is a bit of an older game, but everything still looks great.Overall, I definetly recommend AC2. "

												Assassin's Creed... some call it the CoD of open world games, some call it repetitive yearly crap and some call it The Best Game Evar!!1! Going to say this now, I like the franchise of Assassin's Creed, but not as much as I used too. I was a fanboy of the games, I admit. I thought every game in the series were the best things ever. But now I've become more ""wise"" with my games and such and I don't think they are the best games ever, but more a guilty pleasure.... Assassin's Creed II is a direct sequel of Assassin's Creed. It's a story driven open world game with some social stealth elements and lots of combat. As for the story (what AC is knowned for), AC II is good, an improvement over AC I. But like many other games, it felt rushed towards the end and has a ♥♥♥♥ing sequel bait (like we need more). It has interesting characters (not the best, but interesting) and one of the few games were I actually like the main character. Ezio Auditore da Firenze, an Italian plumb--playboy, rich, cocky and charismatic lovable man. I love him and so do a lot of people. How does the gameplay hold up? Well it's an improvement over the first game, that is for sure. It follows the same logic, you're an Assassin, here's a contract, now go stab the guy. It is less repetitive than the first instalement. Now you have even more side quests to do, all kinda repetitive, but the Assassination Contracts are always a yes in my book for an Assassin's Creed game. The side quests are either go deliver mail (you are a banker that delivers stuff at the start of the game); beat up a man for cheating on his wife; assassinate a Templar (enemy of the Assassin) assossiate or you race someone across the map. The combat has become easier, now instead of waiting and countering everyone, you can wait, counter and shoot them! I swear, every installement of AC makes you have more and more weapons to use, it's too much for me. The game is really easy, a little too easy at points. You can purchase better weapons and armor in the game with money (trust me, you will have way too much cash), which makes the game easier. Is the world good? Yes, you have more places to go to than AC 1 and you go to Venezia, I love Italy and I want to give AC II a big kiss for placing this game there. The game did not age well compared to the other instalements. It still sort of look good to me, but it is poorly executed at times, it's laughable at points (i.e right after you get hidden blades, the scene makes me laugh every time how bad it is). The stealth in the game is different from the first game, and it's better. You can blend in crowds instead of praying everywhere you go. The more ""bad"" actions you do, the more the guards will notice you etc... Is it the best game in the series, I do not know. I don't know which one I prefer, Assassin's Creed II or Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. AC II is more an AC game, but I did spend over 600 hours into ACB on xbox... In the end, it's a really good game, I like it a lot. But it is not the ""best game ever"" I thought it was. Good story, good world, easy but fun combat and it has Ezio, can't argue on that. I give it a 8.5/10			"

PROS:+ awesome and long story+ cool mix between historical settings and Animus UI+ huge maps (five cities + extra areas)+ horse riding+ assassination missions+ smooth combat with impressive combos+ weapon selection including a gun mounted on the wristCONS:- uPlay- funky AI behavior from time to time- sometimes a bit repetitive guard fighting- occassional graphical glitches- not great video card optimization- audio can go out of sync in very rare occassionsComment:We leave Altair from the previous game to start a new adventure with Ezio. This game is a real upgrade from the first AC. The developers at Ubisoft listened to what people had to say about their first game in this franchise and created this unique and spectacular game! Basically all areas have been improved. AC2 take you for a ride with the really good (and rather long) storyline where Ezio evolves from a boy to a man ... and in the end to an ultimate assassin. The game is fun, it has lots of side missions and collectibles as well. Never have I found a dull moment in this game. The combat is smooth and apart from the generic guard fighting it is not at all repetitive. Main assassinations are great and fun, each playing out a bit differently to mix things up a bit. Again I also applaud the Desmond timeline although so many people do not like it I think it fits perfectly into the game. Of course there are drawbacks to this game. One being a sometimes funky AI for both allies and enemies. But the main flaw is in this case uPlay. This was the first game to implement it and back then it was a disaster. Today it is better but still far from good because starting the game on Steam just launches uPlay and THEN you can start your game. So you need a uPlay account. Otherwise the game itself is fantastic and takes you on a journey through renaissance Italy where you will adore both the story and the visuals. I know I did. Recommended!			"

												Very fun game!The controls can be a bit hard to get used to at first (if you haven't played much of AC1). For the most part, the movement is fluid, but a few times Ezio got stuck or made a weird decision to leap off the side of a building for no reason...Much better than what I glimpse from the 1 hour or so I've played of AC1, though the combat is still quite slow and focuses on counter-attacks.Campaign does look to be about 20 hours long, though if you do all the side missions and object hunts, it might push 35 hours. However, don't make my mistake and try looking for all the treasures BEFORE finishing the campaign, because that really make you tired :PBiggest complaint I have is that, for an assassin, Ezio is too strong in normal combat. Sure, he should be good, but there really is no incentive for staying in cover, except that it doesn't waste your time. I'd like to see battles that I know I will lose if I fight, but right now a 1v8 fight is actually a 1v1 fight 8 times.			"

Ezio Auditore fighting the templars for vengance then turns into fighting to find answers as to what the templars are upto. The storyline and gameplay is really cool and fun to get into. It may have been because I just got out of an Art History class that made me get into the game even more. Since they used historical buildings, paintings, and people in this game. I would suggest this game to anyone who likes Action Adventure in anyway.			"

												Assassin's Creed 2 was universally regarded as an improvement over the first game and I am of the same opinion. Gone are the same repetitive side quests at every turn. Instead we get a game more expansive and with more depth than its predecessor and a beautifully crafted medieval Italy to explore and experience. The protagonist, Ezio, is also an improvement over Altair feeling more like a protagonist rather than a puppet that the player guides through the game world. Assassin's Creed 2 is definitely one of the best titles in the series.			"

												The start of a legend and stars one of the most likable characters in the franchise. This game puts you in the shoes of the young Florentine nobleman, Ezio Auditore. As an origin story for Ezio and the ongoing story for the meta-plot involving Desmond Miles, you uncover the plots unrecorded by history as Templars and Assassins continue to wage war against one another for the ultimate prize in both the past and the present.Whereas Assassin's Creed 1 introduced us to the idea of Templars vs Assassins; here it is fleshed out further with conspiracies and intrigue. Assassin's Creed 2 is also an interesting dive into historical Italy during the Renaissance. Very few games have pulled off a fully involved historical drama with attention to detail that this one does.I fully enjoyed Ezio's origin story and his journey of self-discovery. He is literally Renassiance Batman with a very similar revenge plot, but at the same time the plot twists and turns keep the ideas fresh and interesting.While graphically dated by today's standards, AC2 still stands the test of time. Combat mechanics are still very fluid and easy to pick up and play. If you enjoy alternative history or enjoy a good open world game, AC2 is definitely a good pick.			"

												Do I recommend this game? Where is the 'Hell Yes' button?If you are new to the series, this is a great place to start. The controls will be taught to you in the early stages of the game very clearly, unlike some other games in the franchise which teach some things but expect you to know others already. This is also a great entry to the story of the series if you don't feel like playing through the first one. (this game is far superior to the original in pretty much every way.)I've owned this game for some years now and it was basically one of those games that were part of my backlog of games, most of which will never get played despite my intention to play them all. I'm sooo glad that I decided to play this game over some others in that backlog of mine. The game still is visually pleasing, not yet too 'retro' feeling (This review written in 2015). I was still in awe of many of the visuals. More importantly though, this game has great gameplay, a great story, great characters, great acting and animation. This is the real deal, a gamer's game. Stuffed so full of content, I didn't even do all the extra missions (not even close) and I spent 30 hours in this game enjoying every second. I really can't recommend the game enough. It starts slow and you might be bored for the first bit but trust me when I say that it gets GOOD and fairly quickly. I am now starting to play the next game in the series, Brotherhood, which picks up right where this left off in a very epic way. Make sure you sit at the start screen in these games for a minute or two before pressing start/enter to watch the opening cinematic. It won't play when you start a new game and the opening cinematics in these games are very good.			"

												ACII reprresents an improvement on the original Assassins Creed in almost every way.The game introduces us to Ezio, and his journey to discover his fathers murderer.  In the process of course he uncovers his true identity, and advances the story and plot that was introduced in the first game.  The story that revolves around the animus is also here, however its emphasis is greatly dimished from the first game.The elements that made the first game so fun are still here: Open world parkour, vast cities to explore, fun combat, mini games such as time trials and beat up events, overlook climbing, etc.  However adding to the mix are several new weapon types including a pistol, a customizable ""home base"" mini-city to generate wealth and keep your ""stuff"", upgradeable armor, paintings to collect and display, and the introduction of currency ""florins"" which you can loot from dead bodies or find in chests that are scattered about.  In short there is a LOT more to do than before, resulting in a more immersive experience.The character animations and sound design are both excellent.  Cut scenes are rendered in real time as before and character emotes and voice acting are superb.  I use the XBOX 360 controller since clearly the controls were designed with the console in mind.Graphically the game is an improvement over the original although at times the textures show their age during cutscenes.  A remastered version of this game would be fantastic.The level of historical content is huge, with additional info available from the abundance of database entries accessible at any time.  I actually learned a lot of things I did not know.3D Vision support is superb with the HelixMod update.Here are a few things I found a bit frustrating:1) Flaky controls at times, particularly during the ""lara croft"" style tomb raids.  Advanced parkour moves are typically not necessary for the rest of the game, so learning them during the tomb raids can be frustrating and require a great deal of precision.2) Checkpoint saves suck in general, and here there are moments where the checkpoints are too far apart, requiring you to replay quite a bit.3) The frame-rate will frequently drop, especially in cities.  I have a nice mid-range system (780gtx/i5-4850) so I should not be seeing drops in the frame rate, which strikes me as just poor PC optimization.Still despite some annoyances this game kept my attention through many, many hours. Overall heartily recommended.9/10 "

												I've had all but the last Assassin's Creed games for a while now. Having only played 10 minutes of each before moving on, I'd always felt I hadn't given it enough of a chance. So this week I decided to do that and sit down for a proper go. I couldn't find my AssCre disc 1 so I went with this, the second one. The controls were putting me off when I first started to play, with some really confusing layouts which meant I was constantly hitting the wrong keys and getting stuck. Once I started to master it though, it became second nature. I'm pretty certain anyone that plays this will feel the same way and will want to give up after a few failures but don't, stick at it. The controls are fine once you get your head around them and allow you to do quite a few different things with only a few key presses. The story is absolutely amazing. Set in the 1400's in Italy it tells the revenge story of your character, who witnesses the death of his father and brother. This takes him around the country finding the perputrators. Voice acting is second to none, some of the best and more like watching a film it's that well produced. Gameplay can get a tad repetitive with a lot of, kill this person, hide here, steal that but they are joined by bucket loads of side quests which break up the monotony. That's not to say it's boring, but more varaity would've been nice.Graphics are great but are showing thier age a bit now, especially when you look at AssCree 3 and 4. All in all, I'm sorry I never played this before now. I can really understand why there's a huge cult following for the series. The price you can get this at, you'd be a fool not to play it. It's one of the best games I've played, easily in the top 10. Make sure you DO stick with it though as I mentioned. Just fight through any frustration you might come across.Oh and one last thing. It's LONG! I thought it was about to end on around 4 occasions, then it sent me on another quest! There are 12 chapters in the normal version, and 14 with all DLC. I didn't realise I had the 14 chapter version so got to play the lot. Still, without those 2 extra chapters the game is extremely long.Get it!			"

												Assassin's Creed II is a definite improvement over the first game in terms of mission variety, combat mechanics, storytelling and world building. But it is still bogged down by a lot of design choices that leave me puzzled.First of all, I just wanted to say that similarly with the predecessor, the modern day stuff just blows the big one. None of the characters are likeable. Desmond is really boring, and just does what he's told without a single thought. That Shaun guy is just a huge prick. And the computer girl just gives me ""2edgy"" vibes all the time. Lucy is okay because she's nice, but that's honestly the best trait any of the characters have. It still doesn't make me care about her.Now, most of the game is done in the past storyline which is great. Lots of likeable and dislikeable characters which made me care about them. The protagonist, Ezio is a lot of fun, Leonardo de Vinci is impossible to hate, and all the supporting characters are interesting. The vast amount of history available in the database on the real-life locations and characters also make this game very unique. (Though sometimes the history tidbits sound like they were written by some angsty-and-trying-to-be-cool teenager, which is very off-putting.)I also really enjoyed the updated weapon variety and the toned down reliance on repetitive mission types. What I mean by that is in the first game, 80% of missions were just eavesdropping, or pickpocketing (in other words, something incredibly trivial). In this game, there's a larger variety of missions, and the dependence on a single mechanic isn't really as present.Negatives? Combat is simple (which is fine) but somehow they still manage to make it incredibly finnicky and not smooth. Same with wall running, I found myself jumping in the complete opposite direction to what I wanted or jumping off of a building way too many times. Also the HUD is very annoying; it's incredibly ugly, intruisive and distracting. Anything that reminds you that you're in the Animus was such a headache to look at. The only other thing on the technical side of things is the texture pop-in. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥it's awful. At least this game runs better than the first one.And while the story is interesting at points, it really just cumulates in the last quarter of the game. The first three quarters is just ""kill this guy for revenge"" over and over again. And the ending is incredibly nonsensical. I'm not going to spoil it, but it's borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. While it's an improvement over the first game, I still can only recommend this as a buy when it's on sale. To me there are just so many strange things that bring the quality of the game down. I really don't get the hype around this series when there are so many poorly executed mechanics right up front and center. I give this a 7.0/10. It's a good game, but not much more.			"

												A great follow-up to Assassin's Creed. Much to my personal joy and displeasure, this game is far less about stealth, and more about getting the job done. The wotry continues to captivate, as you watch Ezio Auditore, go from being a troubled making teenager, to an Adult looking to finish what his family had started. Combat is much smother, and social interaction is the key, from making allies to blending in with crowds, and avoiding the gain of noteriety. The DLC ads even more to the story, filling in what I felt like were plot gaps, that make the Templar seem like slackers, making the Delux edition well worth the extra cost.			"

												This tale of young ezio bring so much memories back when i beat this game on xbox...The music is just grand, gameplay brought the series to a whole new level.Way better than it's ancestor Assassin's Creed.Controls on PC take a little getting used to, but you can always change your bindings.A part of my heart belongs to this series, and half of that part belongs to Assassin's Creed 2...

There are also some side quests. And you can hire some mercenaries and hookers to distract the guards! The story is also good but you have to pay attention if you want to understand.

												To the point:Positive:+ nice story with great historical elements+ particulary lovely music+ Italy is looking good, I like the architectural reference to the original buildings+ great mood+ very good performance (detail is ok, no game crashes)Negative:- controls and manovering is the most illogical I've ever seen- fighting system ditto- AI is preposterous- uPlay - all the way through is a piece of junk made by incompetent team (errors, update & patch problems, issues with account settings)- bonus Auditore tomb is not worth points whatsoever. Don't.Get.It.Ever. A waste of time and your nerves.- camera view is sometimes even more illogical than controls, especially during tomb explorations with timer- Faulty tip system - buttons are sometimes wrongly described and/or not mentioned at all. A great deal of controling during fight you must figure out by yourself.- horse running looks particulary hilarious (""Jolly Jumper mode on"") :P- ruffian groups to hire are idiots- wanted posters... hung on the height of the second or third floor, five metres above the street level...

												Assassin's Creed 2 further polishes what Assassin's Creed started. Removing the linear preparation and focusing more heavily on story helped meld this series away from a ""prep, stab, rinse, repeat"" to a much more enjoyable ""I'm doing this because I have to story."" Free-Running is improved, voice acting is superb, beating out the rigid acting of Altair.It is definitely a worthy successor that while doesn't change the formula up too much, still provides enough new to the table to justify it's price and the time commitment.

												I can recommend this game despite the fact I had to spend fifteen minutes fighting Uplay just so it wouldn't crash, that's really great praise right there. But do not fear, oh reader, once you properly install it the game runs smoothly, at least it did for me.After the stunt with Uplay I was ready to growl, complain and call it quits, and yet this classic deserves all the praise it gets and once I started playing I couldn't stop.The controls on pc, with mouse and keyboard, were kinda weird at first for me. But then I started liking the sassy main character and learnt to jump from roof to roof without falling on top of innocent bystanders, and things improved. The story is compelling, Ezio is charismatic, the gameplay makes you feel like you can do parkour in real life. Even collectings things all over the cities wasn't boring because the landscapes and atmosphere are quite immersive.I loved it, and that's coming from someone who was ready to dismiss it because Uplay sucks and I'm quite skeptical of things that turn into long sagas. Now I feel like some of the ramdon NPCs, who stare at Ezio in wonder while he climbs a cathedral and mutter things like ""Santa Madre di Dio!"" or ""I should find a way to stay in shape too"". Yeah. Go buy it.			"

The story is a fantastic emotional tale featuring an immediately likeable hero. It is a bit of an older game, but everything still looks great.Overall, I definetly recommend AC2. "

The graphics are still very good, even though this game came out a few years ago; and as usual, music and voice acting is superb. The story is probably the best of all the other games in the franchise, simply because Ezio actually has friends and family around (other games depict him as more solemn person who works alone). It's very immersive, the crouds felt very real and the enviroments were lifelike. As always, combat is very fun (again, it probably beats the other games; the first was very hard while the rest are very easy). Buy this game now! It's very cheap on sale, and gives well over 20 hours of gameplay.			"

												It was on sale and I deicded to finally play it because I was promised a realistic Venice (beyond that, I hate the main storyline of AC games that messes with history and portrays assassins as good and templars as bad. I can never get over that). The good: - Better interface than Assassin's Creed 1. Better everything than in the 1st game.- Great atmosphere. Cities look great.- When it works, the acrobatic action is really fun.- There is enough stuff to do.The bad:- It is not open-ended when this kind of game clearly should be- You cannot replay an earlier part of the game. There is only one savegame!!!- Some of the acting is kind of lame, though most of it was ok.- Some faces look/animate pretty badly- It often forces the main storyline down your throat and won't let you get to the cool stuff if you don't go with it. Again, the game feels like it should be sandboxy and open-ended but it isn't really.- You are forced to install and use Uplay from Ubisoft to play the game. Uplay will glitch out and not let you play or mess up your savegame and is just generally annoying and forced and I will make a consious attempt not to use it anymore. - Obviously this is not entirely the game's fault but, for such a famous game, I am surprised to see almost no mods for it. Again, the surprise is in the fact that sandbox-type games like this one usually have good modding support.- When the parkour acrobatics system fails, it looks quite clumsy and annoying. The player has little control over the process as it simply involves holding 3 buttons together, so you can't get much better at it except by trying to turn your character better.- The controls and interface clearly show that it's a console port.So yes, there are many points that annoy me, but the game is still awesome.

												Salute, Claudia.This game is vastly superior to Assassin's Creed. The combat feels a lot better and the environments are much better. The mini-game of maintain the town feels rewarding, and the fetch quests to find feathers and things feel a lot better than finding Templar banners in AC1.My one complaint is that it's a stealth game about assassintions, but there are some scripted sequences where you always get caught and always have to fight or escape from large groups of guards. I would have preferred if the game rewarded stealth gameplay by allowing you to bypass combat.			"

												The start of the Ezio trilogy, considered as one of the best character to have such compelling background. Started of when he was only 17 years old and since then the beginning of him as an Assassin. It took me 46 hours just to complete this game. 2 Tries. And that's not even 100% completion. There is just so much in this world. The hidden secret and all of those things. Despite being a 5 year old game the replayability of this game is just amazing. The game start off at an amazing pace telling you what happen in the previous game quite well. I have never played Assassin's Creed, but I heard that this one is the Holy Piece in the Assassin's Series and boy I was not disappoint by it. Great game. For me here is the pros & cons :Pros :+ Great story.+ The story of Ezio from the age of 17 till he is around in his 40's.+ The game graphic still looks ""Ok"" for my eyes.+ Stabbing people in the back has never been so good.+ So many hidden secrets.+ Great replayability.+ Gameplay pretty fluid + Requiescat in PaceCons :- F***** UPLAY is sh***- Still some minor bug> For me this is an 8.5/10. Get the whole trilogy of Ezio if it's on sale. But be prepare for the sh*tty Uplay.			"

												That's what I expect of an Assassin Game.The first AC game was a real let down for me... no real story just some random assassinations in seemingly generic cities. I couldn't identify myself with Altair.But Ezio is a whole different story there. You got everything, charming characters you get to like or dislike, a really large challenging universe with a background which has its twists and way way to many collectibles.Completiontime about 25 hours with most side quests and challenges done.

												Assassin's Creed 2 is one of the few true masterpieces of the video game medium.  Can you feel it? The hairs raising on the back of your neck? When was the last time a video game did that to you? Whether you're running over rooftops or solving mysterious puzzles, Assassin's Creed 2 never ceases to be interesting and fun. The conspiracy theory at the core of the plot is both fascinating and terrifying at the same time and serves to completely engross you in the game's story, characters and setting with a fantastic sense of wonderment and curiosity unlike any videogame you've ever played before.  A conspiracy theory involving the creation of man, his purpose, his nature and most importantly, his rulers. The game talks about the origin and evolution of religion, objective truth and how history can be shaped and molded into creating truths that better suit humanity's rulers. Important philosophical questions are raised and never truly answered because maybe they're not meant to and you're supposed to find your own meaning and purpose in the world. The game was designed to make you think and reflect on these things by yourself and I believe that makes Assassin's Creed 2 one of the best and most important games of our generation.  Buon viaggio!

												Second Assassin's creed game I'm playing and I loved it. (Altair is still my fave tho)Let's start for once with some flaws: THE ♥♥♥♥ING CONTROLS. Jesus. I played it on PC without any controller and I was about to ragequit more than once just because of this. It's really sad because the game is good but these little things break the fluidity of the game. Also, the speed runs with timers either in missions or looking for Altair's armor could have been so much fun if it wasn't for the contextual camera which also ♥♥♥♥ed me up so many times. (And seems like I'm not the only one.)As for the good points.. There's many of them:- There's a hugeeee difference when it comes to graphics compared with the first game. - The storyline is great and will probably still be for the next games with Ezio.- If you consider yourself being a completionist and doing all the extra.. the game can be pretty lonnggg. (I just played the main story with some extra and it's already 35hours of gameplay)Overall : Great (AC I still better [don't hit me plz, I know most people enjoyed Ezio by far compared to the other characters])!I'll be playing the next AC for sure (and hoping for some fixes about the controls)Buy it on sale if you want but it's worth its 10$ !I'd give it an 8/10!

												It was on sale and I deicded to finally play it because I was promised a realistic Venice (beyond that, I hate the main storyline of AC games that messes with history and portrays assassins as good and templars as bad. I can never get over that). The good: - Better interface than Assassin's Creed 1. Better everything than in the 1st game.- Great atmosphere. Cities look great.- When it works, the acrobatic action is really fun.- There is enough stuff to do.The bad:- It is not open-ended when this kind of game clearly should be- You cannot replay an earlier part of the game. There is only one savegame!!!- Some of the acting is kind of lame, though most of it was ok.- Some faces look/animate pretty badly- It often forces the main storyline down your throat and won't let you get to the cool stuff if you don't go with it. Again, the game feels like it should be sandboxy and open-ended but it isn't really.- You are forced to install and use Uplay from Ubisoft to play the game. Uplay will glitch out and not let you play or mess up your savegame and is just generally annoying and forced and I will make a consious attempt not to use it anymore. - Obviously this is not entirely the game's fault but, for such a famous game, I am surprised to see almost no mods for it. Again, the surprise is in the fact that sandbox-type games like this one usually have good modding support.- When the parkour acrobatics system fails, it looks quite clumsy and annoying. The player has little control over the process as it simply involves holding 3 buttons together, so you can't get much better at it except by trying to turn your character better.- The controls and interface clearly show that it's a console port.So yes, there are many points that annoy me, but the game is still awesome.

												I am a extreme completionist. I've purchased all of the assassin's creed games up until black flag, and may I say I have never played a series that had a story so immersive that I feel compelled to activtly communicate it to my PC bretheren. This release in particular allows you to relive the memories of Ezio Auditore de Firenze, a boy, turned assassin by the death of his family. From the perspective of this assassin you learn the code of manhood, and the assassin's creed. The extreme pain of seeing death to being able to deliver it numbly. You see a boy broken; then reborn. His story ties the series into the future with Desmond, the past with Altair, and in his own time. It is argued that Altair is the best assassin, and by far he is but after literally living the life of Ezio, you feel as though part of his morality has been transfered to you... the player. Altair was a cold killer only bound to the creed by himself and a few friends where Ezio devotes his soul to revenge to the point of nearly quitting. What can I say, the bleeding effect didn't only alter Desmond.			"

												Assassin's Creed 2 is a story, well possibly one of the best stories in the AC world, about an Assassin named Ezio Auditore da Firenze. A man that's naturally born into the true form of the order. This story will keep you in suspense, hit you in the feelers, and make you smile at some real historical figures set in the AC world, including places. I will tell you that you can spend lots of hours on this game alone just with the side quests, treasure hunting, codexes, seals, so on. The world is beautiful graphically and the every single character is lovable. The replayability is high, I've completed this game once before on console and had to buy it for PC just to experience it again. I highly encourage gamers to give this title a try if they haven't yet.			"

If you've ever wanted to throw people off of tall buildings and then watch as people crowd around the body in both amazement and shock, this is your game. If you've never wanted to do any of that, then what's wrong with you? Kidding. Seriously, get this game, you won't regret it.9/10			"

												Probably the best received game of the original ""trilogy""...Assassins Creed was originally planned as a trilogy, through which is wound a modern-day thread to give it depth and meaning, and to tie the three ancestor's lives together with meaning. Assassins Creed 2 was the ""Deus Ex"" of the series, it set the standard for all that followed, but was never bested. ""often copied, never equalled"" as the saying goes, this was to set the theme and style for all that followed but they were mere ""essays in the craft"" as a famous author once wrote.Set in Renaissance Italy, it tells the story of Ezio Auditore da Firenze, Ezio of the Auditore family of Florence. Renaissance Italy was a formative time for Italy and mainland Europe, and was an era where famous architects and artists abounded and marked their place in history. Here in this very city you can climb Florence Cathedral, designed by Giotto and engineered by Brunelleschi, wonder at the many re-created towers of San Gimignano and take in the beauty of Tuscany and it's many re-created landmarks.This whole game is rich in history and has had entire regions of Italy, complete with it's famous people and landmarks, transplanted into it's very core, and this is your playground.Following on from the original Assassins Creed, which introduced you to Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad who was a member of a cult based on the real-life Ha-shi-shin, more correctly referred to in history as the ""Asasiyun"", Ezio continues the story-arc of Desmond Miles, a modern-day descendant of the original Assassins, on his unbidden quest to seek out the Piece of Eden, and to recover it and use it in defense against The Templars. A typical ""them and us"" scenario but beautifully executed, immersing the player into selected regions of real-life history, and merging it with a simple yet intricate fictitious concept.Throughout the game you, the player, become Ezio, a rogue, a charmer and a parkour master... and possibly one of the most-loved characters of the entire series. You start off with nothing, but following the in-game death of your father and brothers, you very quickly learn the arts of stealth, stealing and most important of all, the deadly art of assassination. At fist it is only for revenge but surrounded by friends and family, you are slowly guided and ""trained"" to become an efficient killer in order to ""take out"" various city officials who are actually Templar Agents, bent on the domination of ""the people"".As you progress through the game you learn more about the Templars and the Assassins, and the reason behind their long-term enmity, and the importance and urgency of trying to thwart them in their own deadly quest to dominate the entire earth.All this content-rich plot is set in a beautifully recreated and innovative period of our own history when creativity was at it's peak and when famous people such as Leonardo da Vinci and Machiavelli actually lived and contributed to all that we know today.Playing this game is more that just playing through a simple plot, it is an opportunity to experience  one of the most important periods of European history, and to virtually walk the very streets and admire the legendary architecture of Renaissance Italy, which has been an inspiration to us right down to this day.

												Its my honest opinion the Original Assassins creed games are the backbone of what stealth games are today. The franchise as a whole but mainly the earlier titles, laid the foundation for such a large and widely growing fanbase for the stealth genre we have today. Assassins creed is a must play game for any stealth fanatics showing off massive upgrades to its father title named 'Assassins Creed'. Assassins Creed 2 promotes richer storyline with an immersive gameplay if you're in the right mindset.  Honestly my favourite franchise of games ever created , moulding my taste of games and what I now like today 10/10			"

												Still the best Assassin's Creed, and I've played most of them.  When I think about what made this game so special, I think about these five reasons:1.  Ezio & story.  Ezio is by far the strongest lead character the series has ever had, and the story is engaging right from the start all the way until the mindblowing ending.  Other characters are great as well.2.  Glyphs. These cryptic puzzles are scattered all around the cities, hidden from plain sight but revealed using your special vision.  They're fascinating, creepy as hell, and addictive.  And each one you find contributes towards an important piece of information in the story.  It's glaring that they scrapped these in later AC installments.3.  Music.  Jesper Kyd created the soundtrack and it's nothing short of stellar.  YouTube it if you don't believe me.  4.  Challenge and pacing.  Progression and difficulty feel just right.5.  You get to  punch the pope in the face.This isn't just the best Assassin's Creed, it's a fantastic and memorable game on its own right; so enjoyable that it made AC1 feel like a tech demo in comparison.  If you could only play one Assassin's Creed, play this one.			"

												I bought this to play on an early 2015 Macbook Pro Retina running MacOS Sierra, and had some pretty big problems right out the box.Ubisoft requires you to play this game through their UPlay launcher. This launcher shows nothing but a white box to me. It is still possible to log in but you have to move your cursor around until you find a text input field, hope it's the username field, enter your username, then hit TAB to enter your password. If this works, the launcher will bring up another white box and you have to blindly click around until you (hopefully) hit play in the bottom right corner.Once the game starts, you may only be able to see half the screen, as it will be shifted halfway up your monitor. If you get the correct half of the screen, or if you know which keyboard keys to press, you may be able to get into graphics options and change the resolution. This sometimes fixes your problem, but at this point I figured it would be better to quit and get a refund from Steam, so I don't have any info on the gameplay.Ubisoft has seriously pooped the bed on this one. If you have a Mac and you're thinking of testing your luck, just remember that you can request a refund from Steam within two weeks of purchase as long as you have fewer than 2 hours of playtime.

												This is the first AC I've played since it's the first one in the series that was ported to the Mac. I tried playing the first one (and I would still like to finish it), but it's horrible to look at on Parallels and I unfortunately do not have a PC.My favorite parts of this game are the soundtrack and the parkour aspects. It has the best soundtrack in any of the games up to ""Black Flag"" (since I haven't seen anything past that). Even when I had to do a mission multiple times and got frustrated when the same music signaling I was in the chase sequence or whatever kept playing and I would mute the music to stop bothering me, I could still come back to it and I enjoy it a lot. The parkour aspect - after I figured it out - was REALLY cool. It's just fun to jump up and around obstacles and not feel limited by where I could go. It's how I imagine Spider-man would work without the web-shooters, which is great cause Spidey is one of my favorite supers.They took it out for this game, so I didn't experience it until I loaded up ""Brotherhood"", but I am really, really grateful this didn't have the ""meet the scene requirements"" aspect. I get why that matters, and it makes a lot of sense, lore-wise (e.g., Ezio killed this guy by dropping a ladder on him, if you're reliving a memory, why would you kill him by stabbing him?), but it is SO frustrating, particularly when you're still figuring out the controls. Personally I liked not having to redo a ridiculously long walking sequence so I could try, again, to get ONE requirement done.The graphics are good and the story is okay. Probably the hardest moments were when you unlocked mini scenes with Ezio collecting the feathers for his mother. At 50, your uncle walks in and tells you it's hopeless and Ezio lowers his head sadly. He doesn't say anything, but that scene said a LOT.The puzzles were tough and I had to look up how to get through at least one assassination - the stupid boat one - and the guards could be irritating. But otherwise it was a pleasant game.			"

												Simply amazing, what a wonderful experience.Pros: - Parkour and fighting mechanics have been expanded extensively from the first- Wonderful story line digging deeper into the mystery of the Templars, Assassins and pieces of Eden- If you're a collector nut this has a ton of them to search high and low for- Wonderful visuals from the environment and it's people- Nods back to the first game- Great dialogue and soundtrackPersonal complaints/thoughts:- I didn't find Ezio the most interesting assassin to play as but as I played more of the story his development throughout the years as a harderened assassin by the end of the game gave him more importance taking upon the mantle of his father. I still prefer Altair to Ezio that being that he's already an established assassin who everyone knows about as an assassin but not his name (other than the people in the brotherhood). The one thing that put me off is everyone knew Ezio's name and who he was with his getup, there really was no point to him wearing the assassin's outfit other than paying dues to his father and family. Ezio felt like a very rookie assassin to me, it really bothered me that I felt 80% of the game I was just avenging his family's losses out of revenge and you were put though the learning process of Eden, Templars and the Assassin brotherhood.Bringing power back to the people and ridding each area of corruption had it's satisfaction on it's own and felt great knowing you made a difference to the areas you visited making Italy a better place again. It is a bit silly however you are given capes of recognition but simply climbing a rooftop is considered a crime? I understand if the guards attack you with the cape if you have killed a civilian or another guard but the cape itself is supposed to be an entitlement for your services to the city and it's people so why be targeted for climbing or accessing restricted areas?I don't like collecting coupious amounts of items for such little gain and this game has a ton of them, little more less than the first game but still a lot.I didn't particularly like having to read subtitles for half english and half Italian spoken dialogue, I do appreciate it added depth to cutscenes and learned some Italian here and there but I couldn't help but get lost a few times or spaced out. I thought in the first game all was translated to English when Desmond asked Lucy. Perhaps things have changed I guess.8/10. Not bothered to collect the other assassin's stone tablet things at this point in time, maybe after I finish AC 3 to access Altair's armor.			"

												Great game. Compelling story. Very immersive. Step into the well equipped role of Ezio Auditore. Stalk the streets of Italy and end yoru prey. This game is a must play.That said, keep in mind that no game is Portal (read ""damn near perfect""). There are a few caveats that make this game annoying. First and foremost: UPlay. Even the retail version of this game is wrapped in Steam, then has a second layer of UPlay. You're efectively running two game platform clients that effectively do the same thing in order to play this game. The only difference is UPlay doesn't have a store. Second is the controls. It's clear that the game's primary SKU was a console system and the PC controls suffer for it as they did in the original. After a while, they become easier to use, however the occasional jumping off a building unintentionally, grabbing the wrong ledge, or jumping the wrong direction will happen all the way to the last level.I encountered a single progression break where one target kept standing back up after killing him and the other that was supposed to be there did not spawn. It was a simple matter of restarting the memory, so it wasn't a big deal. I also encountered a UI bug where the Windows working cursor was visible. This happened often when I accessed UPlay while in game. It's not a deal breaker, but it IS distracting.Even with these faults, the game is spectacular. It gradually introduces you to the tools used by Ezio while keeping you enthralled by the story.			"

												In my humble opinion I have to agree, that this Assassin's Creed version is by far the best part of the Assassin's Creed tetralogy.Yes, the graphics got a lot better in the following parts III and IV; but you have to admit, that the ambience and atmosphere is what the Assassin's Creed games should also be well provided, e.g. follwing the Credo of the Assassin's brotherhood and acting like a true Assassin is just at the  peak in this second part of the tetralogy.Plus the story AND the gameplay will make you satisfied, if you love the genre.

												As I was finally able to play this game on a decent computer, I began to play it soonest possible. The story really succeeded to catch from the very beginning; starting out as a (somehow) normal guy with no weapons and later on obtaining more weapons as you play and collect Codex pages, with which you fight your way through several great cities, to finally defeat the Pope of Roma and thereby avenge the murder of your family. This game really has amused me with both graphics, voice acting (accents!), the beautiful areas, the atmosphere, and the gameplay - sure some missions were almost identical, but you also get to do a huge variety of different tasks such as attending a carnival.Almost nothing for me to put a finger on except a few rarely occouring glitches. The end is also amazing and full of beams and effects. To be honest I'd call this game truly epic.			"

												The AC series is pretty much a 'must' for gamers into RPG. The gameplay videos on Youtube look amazing and the game comes with a fair prize during Steam's campaign sales. AC2 and AC:B are available on OS X as well so there was no second thought about purchasing it. But it doesn't all smell of roses. When you buy the game, they don't tell you that you can't play it before a forceful subscription into Uplay which seems to be some kind of Ubisoft's own gaming platform/environment thing. And if this does not feel enough like Big Brother breathing down your neck, then check this out: you have to agree to some freakin' long legal document before they let you play. Now, what if I didn't want to agree to it? Would I get a reimburse? I won't answer that. Basically Ubisoft kicks in some extra demands AFTER you've paid them. The game starts off pretty awesome and you get the feeling of a great story unfolding but once the intro videos end and you receive control you'll get exposed to a really complicated set of controls. I found myself spending more time in options page during the first hours of gameplay than in-game. Overall I felt very stuck and it was not fun at all. AC discards many 101's of gameplay controls for a reason unclear. It would not even be a problem if the game would give you time to get accommodated with it's specifications, but instead the game starts off with a competition where you have to put those newly learned combos into full use in a tight race over rooftops. It took me full 30+ times to complete it and there was nothing fun about it.BEWARE! As if this was not enough, PC and Mac users have another major obstacle to deal with. After 30 minutes of gameplay it's quite likely that your keyboard or mouse stop working. There's especially high risk that the game starts to conflict if you're using Logitech hardware. If you don't believe me, google something like 'Assassin's Creed 2 keyboard not working' and you'll see that there are whole forums full of guys in trouble with this problem. Ubisoft's own homepage has a topic on this with no suggestions or help from their side. Don't expect any solution or help if you face this problem, you're on your own. I exchanged my Logitech mouse to a Microsoft one and now I can play for about 15 minutes, after that the mouse freezes and I have the option of either to continue playing with Mac's touchpad or restart the game. I have given up any hope to receive better performance out of the game.The game is very mission-based and there's not as much freedom as you would expect if you saw the gameplay videos. I constantly have the feeling that if I only play a little more, it will all become more relaxed and free but I know it's an illusion. It's nothing like Elder Scrolls or Gothic. Big brother Ubisoft really screwed me with this purchase. It's been a very bad experience for me and I know to keep away from Ubisoft products in the future for sure.			"

GameplayIt shines in its fighting mechanics as well as climbing up huge Renaissance towers. You are able to play half of the missions stealthily, by hiding inside crowds or hay piles, though you cannot properly crouch, so sooner or later you will get spotted. There are all sorts of different guards patrolling the cities with different abilities, and morale.StoryThe story is probably the best in the Assassin's Creed series, with good characters and progression. You play as Ezio Auditore who is a young man turned assassin to seek revenge on his father's death in a betrayal. Your main enemies later become the Templars who have locked the Apple of Eden  under their watch. The apple possesses godlike powers which the Assassins seek to keep it away from falling into the wrong hands.GraphicsThe graphics are alright for 2010. The world design is pretty good too.PerformanceCan run on most systems.LongevityThe story lasts 20 hours, which is very good. Plus, you have some bonus quests like running challenges, building up your uncle's villa, etc.OverallA landmark game which fixes almost all the problems in AC 1.9 apples out of 10. "

												Okay, to bw honest I bought this on accident thinking it was with the older Ezio. However, I cannot complain about this accident... infact, I'm thrilled that I accidently recieved this! The story is unbelieveably addictive, the time our protagonist is in is mind blowing, and the system is incredible!To be honest, I never enjoyed any side quests... but, the game makes me want to tackle anything that they throw at me!I mean, I can't be bias... but in my opinion I see nothing wrong with this game... well, except how we must download a silly launcher and must translate the buttons/moves... but this earned my 9.5/10! I would recommend this game if you are curious about Ezio and a great open parkour game			"

												Personal Rating: ""Worth playing""Traditional Rating: 8/10Genre: 3rd Person Action/Adventure***This review does contain potential spoilers so please don't continue reading this until you have played the actual game***When the first Assassin's Creed ended our modern day test subject Desmond Miles, a man with a powerful ancestral assassin's heritage, was still being held hostage by a corporation known as Abstergo Industries. It was during these modern day sequences that we were introduced to Dr. Warren Vidic, who heads up the program where the memories of ones ancestors are accessed through a device known as the Animus. It is here that Desmond Miles was forced to experience his ancestors memories from the time of the Third Crusade - An assassin known as Altair who would break the three tenants of his Assassin's code of conduct in pursuit of the Templar, Robert de Sable, who was said to be after a powerful artifact known as the Piece of Eden. Killing de Sable would reveal that the very man at the head of the Assassin's Brotherhood was a Templar himself and one who was already in possession of this powerful artifact. Confronting and finally killing his leader, the artifact would later reveal a holographic map showing Altair/Desmond where the other artifacts were hidden throughout the world, artifacts so powerful they could change the very destiny of man. Artifacts that Abstergo would kill to get their hands on. It would also be revealed that a former test subject had been leaving cryptic messages only Desmond could decode that would foretell the end of the world.Assassin's Creed II wastes no time in picking up where the first left off. Having discovered that Dr. Vidics assistant Lucy Stillman is a mole, she eventually breaks Desmond out of Abstergo and ferries him off to a safe house where a group of her colleagues have developed an improved Animus. Desmond must once again enter the Animus and access his ancestral memories in the hope that more pieces of the artifact will be revealed before Abstergo can learn of them. This time around we are witness to late fifteenth century Florence as we are introduced to a young nobleman by the name of Ezio Auditore da Firenz who after witnessing the death of his father and brother - brought about by a corrupt official working for the Templar's - is then forced to flee to his Uncles villa with his life and that of his mother and sister hanging in the balance. It is here that Ezio is taught the ways of the Assassin's Creed by his uncle who eventually sets him on a course of revenge that includes killing a number of Templar figureheads all involved in the death of his father and brother with the trail finally leading all the way up to the top of the Vatican itself with Rodrigo Borges - otherwise known as Pope Alexander VI - a powerful man who will stop at nothing to get his hands on the remaining pieces of the artifact. Before doing away with Rodrigo, Ezio is inducted into a secret brotherhood of assassin's having amply proven his worth to the cause.Historically recreating locations such as Venice, Tuscany and Florence the player is introduced to this wonderfully created digital world through main missions and side missions (Rocksteady could take a leaf out of Ubisoft Montreals book on how to create a living and breathing digital world that is a pleasure to explore and not a bore). The world we get to inhabit as our playground is a wonderful recreation of late fifteenth century Italy even going as far as introducing us to a lovable Leonardo Da Vinci who Ezio befriends early in the game and who exists to help decipher the many numerous codex's Ezio comes into contact with. Spanning a period of twenty years the game is a particularly massive one and to be honest this sometimes acts to the detriment of the actual game itself. Assassin's Creed II requires a lot of dedication and patience from its players to progress through and to be honest it starts to suffer near the end because of it. Whilst most certainly a massive improvement over the original in terms of scope, design and story telling it does come at a cost where the game gets so wrapped up in its own awesomeness that it starts to make itself rather redundant, sluggish and dare I say - boring - towards the end with missions that simply exist to pad out an already lengthy game. Just as you think the story is starting to wind down to its conclusion the game will throw another mammoth task your way that will lead into another mammoth task and this may try a very few many gamers patience and tolerance levels as it did mine. Having to find out that I needed to kill nine Lieutenants of the Templar Order towards the end of the game made me want to curse to the heavens after already inhabiting this world for a good 60+ hours. For all the frustration the game induces near its end, it's carried forward by a serpentine plot that is less over the top than the original but far more thrilling and engaging. The ending is a little bit of a disappointment when you finally have Rodrigo Borgias in your assassin's sights. After all the build up this encounter is rather dull and lifeless but thankfully is concluded by a spectacular sequence I will not reveal for those that have yet to complete the adventure.Spending so much time in the shoes of Ezio what ultimately emerges is a gaming protagonist for the ages. Voiced impeccably by a first rate cast, Ezio is immediately likable and enduring and emerges as a fully rounded and developed character that one becomes incredibly vested in early on in the game. I can see why Ubisoft was a little reluctant to pack him away after the adventure concluded going as far as creating two fully fledged sequels continuing his adventures alone. Where as Altair was a one dimensional figure from the past and not particularly likable it's the exact opposite when it comes to Ezio who can be ruthless and cunning but also generous and incredibly warmhearted. Assassin's Creed II when looked at holistically is an impressive game indeed with the graphics looking quite spectacular for the most part although you can see the games original console limitations with muddy textures abound everywhere. Audio, however, from the clash of swords to the sweeping and epic soundtrack through to the incredible voice cast is all top notch throughout the entire game. Ultimately, Assassin's Creed II emerges as a game I loved for the most part where it not for all its irritating inconsistencies towards the end (those final missions were a test of endurance and patience and frankly I could have done without them as it employs one of my pet hates in gaming where more and more enemies are thrown at the player to try and give the illusion of a suddenly ramped up difficulty). This ended up being a slight killjoy rather than the thrill ride I was expecting for a conclusion.But with that being said I still thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time spent in Ezio's company and I look forward to continuing my adventures with him in the future, just hoping and praying slightly that his remaining two adventures are a much tighter affair than his first one.

												If you ever wondered why Assassins Creed games seem to be astronomically popular despite being the same re-hashed content with a cling-thin story, it's becuase they're still riding on the good will of this game and the next two.Assassin's Creed used to be about mystique in the ""real world"" revealed through progression in the ""virtual world"", with a whole lot of face-stabbing thrown in the mix. Ezio as a main character was extremely engaging and relatable. I remember how much fan discussion there used to be about the historical relevance of the Pieces of Eden, and many a fan theory came about as to how they were responsible for things like Hitler's rise to power, Einstein and Edison's genius, etc. They just don't make Assassins Creed games like these anymore.

												Assassin’s Creed II is what the original Assassin’s Creed should have been. With the inner workings of an engine already in place and two years to work with, the developers were able to produce a game that proves the potential of the series. AC2 successfully builds on the formula that was established in the first game and manages to improve upon what worked and fix most of what didn’t. The story picks up where the original left off, with Desmond Miles (and some new allies) on the run from the Templars. But this time he’s going back into the Animus willingly to re-live the memories of another ancestor, an Assassin named Ezio Auditore, in order to brush up on the Assassin skills that he’ll need for the battle ahead. Ezio’s story takes place in 15th century Renaissance Italy, primarily in the cities of Florence, Forli, and Venice. The environments are, as usual, the most interesting element in the game. The sheer scope of the cities and all of the activity going on within is amazing. Just exploring the city, climbing buildings, etc is pretty fun in and of itself, but what you actually get to do in those cities is what elevates AC2 so far above its predecessor. The missions are no longer a series of boring identical tasks cranked out of some tedium factory. Instead, there is a huge variety of mission types and new game mechanics to go along with them. You now have the ability to blend into crowds at will, hire groups to assist you, and much more. Another welcome change is the addition of a “notoriety” system, where you gain notoriety by performing suspicious or illegal actions. Guards will typically only attack you on sight if your notoriety is high or if they see you doing something illegal. This is a huge and most welcome change from the first game, where you’d end up being attacked for the most ridiculous of things (you know... atrocities such as walking too fast). Combat is also improved from the first game. Although it’s still ultimately really easy, it remains fun due to the sheer variety of things you can do (there are lots of different weapons to try and a whole series of new techniques). In addition to the main quest, there is also a ton of other stuff to do. Dozens of optional side missions are available, as well as a series of levels that take place in unique environments that utilize the free-running and platforming elements of the game to great effect (think Prince of Persia style tombs). There is also a “home base” Villa area that you can spend time upgrading and exploring if you wish. Doing so awards you with income that can be used to buy further improvements, more weapons, paintings, etc. This can potentially add hours of playtime and is completely optional. Such is the scope of this game. Perhaps my favorite “extra” bit this game offers is a sub-quest dubbed ""The Truth"". Hidden throughout the environments are glyphs that grant access to a series of puzzles, that when solved, unlock tiny portions of a mysterious video (which, when fully decoded, truly expands the mythology underlying the whole series). What really makes all of these elements come together so well is the main character of Ezio. He is just a likeable guy and is fun to play as. It’s really as simple as that. All in all, it’s hard to ask much more from a sequel. While yes, there are still some flaws here and there, there was nothing that ruined the experience for me to any large degree. Maybe part of it is just how leaps-and-bounds better AC2 is than AC1 that it’s easy to be more forgiving of any blemishes. I suppose that could be it. But then again, it could just simply be that a good game is a good game... I’m inclined to think that’s probably the case here.Grade: A-Note: I don’t recommend playing any of the Assassin’s Creed games unless you have an Xbox360 controller (or equivalent-featured gamepad). The AC games have complicated control schemes and were clearly designed with controllers in mind, so proceed with mouse/keyboard at your own risk.			"

Then download the new versions on the Ubisoft's website. Than get the cd key. Active the game on UPlay. Then maybe you can play it. If you have a controller. If you don't it is almost impossible to play this game with keyboard and mouse. I just bought a Xbox Controller just for this game. I hope it is worth it.			"

												If you're a Mac user I would avoid purchasing this game.When trying to launch the game I got the message 'Unable to access the Internet. Please verify connection' . This was despite having a perfectly healthily connection. I did an online troubleshoot and found this to be a common issue for Steam Mac users but I was unable to find a solid solution. I tried to get a refund from Steam but was sent an  obviously automated response saying I was unable to receive one because my game play exceeded 2 hours. I submitted a new refund request stating that even though my profile displayed 5 hours  game play usage, in actual fact I had never been successful in even launching the game, let alone play it. At this point I tried to compromise with Steam by suggesting that money back into my wallet would be a suffice outcome for me.I received exactly the same automated message from Steam 2 days later stating I was unable to receive a refund because of over usage. At this point I gave up. I have to say I feel pretty cheated and won’t be singing Steam’s praises any time soon.			"

												This game's aged a bit, but it's still a stellar title. In ACII, everything from the first game is improved upon. I mean everything. The climbing, combat, music, etc ends up being miles beyond what ACI offered. Playing as Ezio Auditore, you'll explore Renaissance Italy on your personal quest to avenge your family, but there's much more to Ezio's character arc than just REVENGEANCE. ACII is quite long, it'll take you more than a few hours to complete, and that's if you don't bother with any of the side stuff. Of which there is a fair amount of. Combat is rather simple, but it's satisfying and visually entertaining. No real difficulty to it though. Brutes are a needed addition to the enemy combatants, but they really aren't very intimidating in comparison to how they need to be. The PC port works fine in my experience, though the Uplay client can be a bit frustrating.  "

												Finally got around to playing this in depth after some starting and stopping. I really love the period so getting to roam through Florence and Tuscany during the Renaissance is an incredible experience. The combat is what it is as it's largely you waiting for countering opportunities but there are a variety of moves you start and continue to accrue. Graphics can show their age as they weren't amazing for the time but it's immersive and (seemingly) historically accurate. The tasks can get a bit repetitive but you can always just delve into the story and lore a bit since there's a ton of history to read about. Definitely recomend if you have played another game in the series or are even looking for a good starting point.			"

												A review for a rather... fascinating game.Let me give a backtrack. AC1 was a good game, yet was repetitive. "" Altair, go here, do this. "" Is the majority of the dialouge you would hear. With the new release of AC2, the game is undoubtly the best in the series. The graphics were improved, missions were no longer repetitive and the combat was improved. New moves were added, new weapons, and the feature of shops. Blacksmiths, Tailors, Painters, Bankers and many more shops are located. The game is very non-linear with the chance of looking for artifacts to unlock a special armor. The voice-acting was amazing and as the story progressed, you felt for the character. Although during missions the timers are annoying, and some of the city of Florence is spaced out, I give the game a 9/10. This is an amazing game that you should buy.			"

												A very human main character and an exceptionally strong story make ACII quite remarkable. Exploring Florence and Venice is also a great delight and a visual feast. Overall, there is a good 30 hours of top-notch assassinations, intrigue, and exploration. Add in the fun meta-plot about mysterious symbols and powers and you have a winning combination.There are two main downsides. First, there’s the repetitive nature of the exploring, unlocking viewpoints, and notoriety system. The repetitive nature perhaps indicates the game is a bit too long, with too many similar missions that could have been trimmed to tighten up the flow of the game. Secondly, the combat system is a boring affair, with overly long kill animations and dumb AI that waits its turn to die.Overall, there’s a reason why people say ACII is the best of the series. It is a wonderfully realized sequel worthy of praise. Running around rooftops slicing criminals up is always fun, in the game too.			"

												I can't comment on the gameplay as I haven't the chance to see it in action. Ubisoft's notorious Uplay DRM has locked me out of the game completely, and I can not play a game which I paid money for. The game itself may be grand (and I have no doubt it is from what I've heard), but I'm giving this a thumbs down due to how the anti-piracy has been implemented. This only hurts willing buyers, and I will not support Ubisoft any longer if they keep this up.			"

												Many people think that AC:BH is the best game of AC series, but the best is AC:II in my humble opinion. The game time is about much longer than in AC:BH, you can visit more areas (there is Rome only in AC:BH). The game is more difficult also, it is not a movie like the later parts and the story is very interesting. There are not unnecessary things from AC:BH like the recruting of new assassins, what make game easier only. Because the true assassin fights alone. If you are a newbie to AC series, this is ideal game for the start with this great series.			"

												If you still have not bought this game then I ask you WHY? This game takes the excellent ideas in the first one and makes them fun!!! Yea, what we've been waiting for. This is most people's favorite of the Assassin's Creed games. It introduced Ezio Auditore da Firenze, the by far most likeable protagonist (perhaps because he has a personality!) This was also the FIRST game with Ezio so he wasn't old hat yet. The new setting of renaissance Italy is great. The cities, like in the first game feel different (Florence is huge with large cathedrals and town squares and Venice is more cramped with canals), but unlike the first game the cities seem varied. One block in Florence looks different from another block in Florence. One of the bigger additions to the game was money (a staple in the series now.) Money is f*cking useless! I breezed through the whole game and bought nothing. Literally NOTHING. You can also use money to renovate your villa to gain more money, but this is boring as f*ck! Even though that sh*t's dumb, most of the new features are interesting. There are loads of new murdering gadgets and more missions than before. It has gone from 10 hours of tedium (and some fun) to like 30 hours of fun. *SPOILERS*Also, the final boss is the pope, so that's a plus if you're into channeling your papal anger.			"

												Really a great game, even now in 2014 I would suggest this game to a friend. The gameplay is pretty good, the graphics are nice, even today, and the entire feeling of the game is really good.Presentation: 8/10 - Really feels like I am exploring area's of Italy. The game comes together nicely, sure some of the menu's are slow to load and a little clunky and sure the options menu may be a hassle to get to sometimes, but that shouldn't spoil the game for you. The reason I didn't give this a 9 instead of an 8 is because of the horrendous control scheme.Graphics: 9/10 - Nowadays the graphics aren't amazing, but they are still really solid. They looks pleasing to the eye.Sound: 9/10 - The music is perfect for Italy and sets the mood perfectly, that includes during fighting and exploring.Gameplay: 8.5/10 - I like the gameplay a lot, but since it's a PC port, the controls can be really, really awkward. You also have to use your memory to remember the controls because instead of telling you, ""Press C to crouch"" for example, it will tell you ""Press the Foot Key to crouch."" then you must remember what button you set as the foot key.Lasting Appeal: 8/10 - Decent replayability here, if you really like the story and just like the progression of skills and the game in general, you may want to replay this, maybe 100% the game. Either way, it should keep you busy for a long time as the average time for this game to be completed is around 18 hours, and that's not including the people who 100%'d the game.			"

												Maybe I'm missing something because this game has gotten really good reviews.  However I noticed the following problems early on:-you must hold three buttons simultaneously just to run.  Not one, not two, but three.  This is a cumbersome mechanic and I can't even tell you what the ""profile"" button does.- the main tutorial for the control keys consists of a one minute review of your character's birth.-at no point in the game does it actually say what key to press in the game to do something, sans the control mapping screen.  Instead, for just about everything, from attacking to exiting out of a game menu, there is an icon which corresponds to what the control key does.  So instead of telling you hit x or enter or whatever to do something it will tell you to hit the fist button or the legs button.  Wow, I use the legs button to kick and run?  The head button to taunt?  Very helpful, game designers!  I never would have guessed these things!  Talk about being lazy!-while scrambling up a wall, several times I could neither see the footholds and handholds, nor would my character figure out where they were.  This made climbing the wall frustrating and several times my character jumped to his death instead of moving forward.-you're pretty much thrust into the first few fights with little chance to adjust to the learning curve.

												Assassin’s creed 2 is one of the best stealth games I have played within the last ~4 years. If you like action-stealth games you should play Assassins creed 2. If you hated the first Assassins Creed you really should play Assassins Creed 2. This game has done what the first assassin’s creed fail to do; polish combat, customization, and side content. The combat now feels way more believable because enemies actually simultaneously strike you, unlike the first one where they took turns. The variety of weapons and items available to use also increase the “fun” factor in this game. I feel like a ninja when I use my smoke bombs to evade my enemies. I feel like a modern assassin with my throwing knives, and I feel like bat man when I use my flying machine. Lots of content to be had, I’ve been playing for over 2 dozen hours, and still haven’t beaten this game to 100% completion yet. The historical realism in the storytelling also makes the game very believable. Good Game. BUY			"

												I fell in love with this. But... Problems with Uplay installation and crashing... Come on, seriously? Guys, the way company delivers the game is one the best ways to leave a good or bad impression. You leave bad one. But thanks to Steam users and guides I got through that. And, actually, i work in IT so i'm kinda used to when things that have to work brilliantly don't work at all, and there always are people who already know what to do.If you want to try, get ready to fix some troubles with Uplay. Guides will help.Now ok, let us return to the game. Epic plot. Smart developed. Beautiful designed interfaces (even if there are some unnecessary confirmations: if i want to heal now, that means I want to heal now, there is no need to ask me if I'm sure or not).New breath to classical vengeance stories.Definentely yes.

												Despite the fact that the controls are terrible in this game, I really enjoyed playing this game. The problem with the controls is that they never mention the key you need to press for a certain action. For example, they'll show a ""hand icon"" to steal money, and not the actual keyboard key to use for the action. So you have to go into the menu, to learn which key is bound to that icon. Its really annoying and had me waste a lot of time, trying to memorize all the keys.Overall the game is amazing. I really like the gameplay. This was the first AC game I played and it got me hooked to the franchise.7/10 (For bad controls. Although I think a controller would work perfectly for this game.)			"

												While the games mechanics are a little dated, the game still offers a pretty good story. It runs a little long and can get a little repeative (you kill one or two main guys and move on the the next chapter). It's got some puzzle elements (that can be hella creepy). The climbing controls can make you wanna put your fist though a wall. But it's an older game now, so you can look past all those minor annoyances (also since they're approved upon in sequels). If you're looking to jump on the Assassin's Creed train, I'd suggest starting here. (The first game doesn't hold it's age well, I don't think.) ACII's got sealth but not in a super serious style, platforming and there's lots of stabbing. Oh and collectibles, lots of collectibles.			"

												As much As I want to like and recommend this game I just cannot Unless you like hard pc angle control and view angles that frustrate you to the point where i will not finnish my 2nd playthrough. I did finnish 1 playthrough because when I buy a game I must try to finnish once to get moneys worth out of the game. I liked the game story itself but hated the view and controls. I have never been so angry and frustrated playing a game. I played both Darksiders (video walkthrough needed) and they were the hardest games I have and are linear and would recommend them over this game even though the story may not be as goodAfter all of that I just picked up Brotherhood Deluxe for 7.98 reviews say controlls better. I am a sucker for punishment lol. I want to like this series it could have been so good. I wonder if it was more designed  for console and not pcI remember the reason I quit playing I am stuck in a dungeon with water and have to jump to a few poles then bounce of a wall then swing around on some bars back to a door to open. I hit the lever to start and am unable to jump off the 1st pole to 2nd. I can jump in water I can jump back to landing  but will not jump to next pole. Have tried a few time since Dec and finally this week after trying again I said forget it. I have enough other games that work! Now I wondering if it was a bad save.			"

												I thought ""even though it is an Assassin's Creed game how awful renaissance Italy could be?"" so I started playing just to find a more immersive medium than literature.I congragulate the developers for creating such a dull and bland envrionment in one of the most vivid times and places in history.

												As much As I want to like and recommend this game I just cannot Unless you like hard pc angle control and view angles that frustrate you to the point where i will not finnish my 2nd playthrough. I did finnish 1 playthrough because when I buy a game I must try to finnish once to get moneys worth out of the game. I liked the game story itself but hated the view and controls. I have never been so angry and frustrated playing a game. I played both Darksiders (video walkthrough needed) and they were the hardest games I have and are linear and would recommend them over this game even though the story may not be as goodAfter all of that I just picked up Brotherhood Deluxe for 7.98 reviews say controlls better. I am a sucker for punishment lol. I want to like this series it could have been so good. I wonder if it was more designed  for console and not pcI remember the reason I quit playing I am stuck in a dungeon with water and have to jump to a few poles then bounce of a wall then swing around on some bars back to a door to open. I hit the lever to start and am unable to jump off the 1st pole to 2nd. I can jump in water I can jump back to landing  but will not jump to next pole. Have tried a few time since Dec and finally this week after trying again I said forget it. I have enough other games that work! Now I wondering if it was a bad save.			"

												Honestly huge improvement over assassin creed 1, and the main character feels more human to where I can maybe connect with him. gameplay is much more smoother and better. If you were like me and quit AC1 half way through because of boring gameplay then this game will not disappoint! the atmosphere is much better and more real. Also note you prob have to configure Uplay for 3 hours before actually getting to play this xD, but its worth it for me, at least its awesome			"

												Really a great game, even now in 2014 I would suggest this game to a friend. The gameplay is pretty good, the graphics are nice, even today, and the entire feeling of the game is really good.Presentation: 8/10 - Really feels like I am exploring area's of Italy. The game comes together nicely, sure some of the menu's are slow to load and a little clunky and sure the options menu may be a hassle to get to sometimes, but that shouldn't spoil the game for you. The reason I didn't give this a 9 instead of an 8 is because of the horrendous control scheme.Graphics: 9/10 - Nowadays the graphics aren't amazing, but they are still really solid. They looks pleasing to the eye.Sound: 9/10 - The music is perfect for Italy and sets the mood perfectly, that includes during fighting and exploring.Gameplay: 8.5/10 - I like the gameplay a lot, but since it's a PC port, the controls can be really, really awkward. You also have to use your memory to remember the controls because instead of telling you, ""Press C to crouch"" for example, it will tell you ""Press the Foot Key to crouch."" then you must remember what button you set as the foot key.Lasting Appeal: 8/10 - Decent replayability here, if you really like the story and just like the progression of skills and the game in general, you may want to replay this, maybe 100% the game. Either way, it should keep you busy for a long time as the average time for this game to be completed is around 18 hours, and that's not including the people who 100%'d the game.			"

												Pretty fantastic game and a huge improvement on 1.  Instead of a blank slate grr-grr character, you play Ezio, who is pretty well defined.  Story is more relevant, though not by a lot (revenge instead of whatever the ♥♥♥♥ was going on in 1).  Guards are less annoying than in 1, and, well, just... everything is so much better.  This game is great and you should play it if you haven't already....Though, how old is it now?			"

												Assassin’s creed 2 is one of the best stealth games I have played within the last ~4 years. If you like action-stealth games you should play Assassins creed 2. If you hated the first Assassins Creed you really should play Assassins Creed 2. This game has done what the first assassin’s creed fail to do; polish combat, customization, and side content. The combat now feels way more believable because enemies actually simultaneously strike you, unlike the first one where they took turns. The variety of weapons and items available to use also increase the “fun” factor in this game. I feel like a ninja when I use my smoke bombs to evade my enemies. I feel like a modern assassin with my throwing knives, and I feel like bat man when I use my flying machine. Lots of content to be had, I’ve been playing for over 2 dozen hours, and still haven’t beaten this game to 100% completion yet. The historical realism in the storytelling also makes the game very believable. Good Game. BUY			"

												This is quite a dated game, but I only recently played it right through and I absolutely loved it.Things I liked Open world gives you time to get used to controls Fighting system and controls were fantastic. A lot of depth to what you can do Animation of fighting and running around was superb Storyline + Sidemission format worked well for me One can employ stategy when taking down targets "

U Play refuses to load aswell. Not to mention the unnessesary code you need to copy and type in when the game ""loads"".I doubt I'm doing anything wrong...

												If you still have not bought this game then I ask you WHY? This game takes the excellent ideas in the first one and makes them fun!!! Yea, what we've been waiting for. This is most people's favorite of the Assassin's Creed games. It introduced Ezio Auditore da Firenze, the by far most likeable protagonist (perhaps because he has a personality!) This was also the FIRST game with Ezio so he wasn't old hat yet. The new setting of renaissance Italy is great. The cities, like in the first game feel different (Florence is huge with large cathedrals and town squares and Venice is more cramped with canals), but unlike the first game the cities seem varied. One block in Florence looks different from another block in Florence. One of the bigger additions to the game was money (a staple in the series now.) Money is f*cking useless! I breezed through the whole game and bought nothing. Literally NOTHING. You can also use money to renovate your villa to gain more money, but this is boring as f*ck! Even though that sh*t's dumb, most of the new features are interesting. There are loads of new murdering gadgets and more missions than before. It has gone from 10 hours of tedium (and some fun) to like 30 hours of fun. *SPOILERS*Also, the final boss is the pope, so that's a plus if you're into channeling your papal anger.			"

												Maybe I'm missing something because this game has gotten really good reviews.  However I noticed the following problems early on:-you must hold three buttons simultaneously just to run.  Not one, not two, but three.  This is a cumbersome mechanic and I can't even tell you what the ""profile"" button does.- the main tutorial for the control keys consists of a one minute review of your character's birth.-at no point in the game does it actually say what key to press in the game to do something, sans the control mapping screen.  Instead, for just about everything, from attacking to exiting out of a game menu, there is an icon which corresponds to what the control key does.  So instead of telling you hit x or enter or whatever to do something it will tell you to hit the fist button or the legs button.  Wow, I use the legs button to kick and run?  The head button to taunt?  Very helpful, game designers!  I never would have guessed these things!  Talk about being lazy!-while scrambling up a wall, several times I could neither see the footholds and handholds, nor would my character figure out where they were.  This made climbing the wall frustrating and several times my character jumped to his death instead of moving forward.-you're pretty much thrust into the first few fights with little chance to adjust to the learning curve.

All those people having problems with U-Play are just not good enough to play this masterpiece. I went throuh the registration and everything else - easy to login/register and access the game from U-Play.			"

												Phewwwww Just took a trip through Italy in the great Renaissance Times..... and it was fun! This game is a must play one of the best in the year and really took a turn in graphics. It had an amazing story following the first game with a new character named Etzio (I think i spelled that right). Still Desmond must fight in the present time to defeat the templars and go in ""baby"" to see his ancestors past secrets. Great game I wish I didn't waste as many time on the side missions, but hey i completed it and it was good. I would say all is good except one problem I hope they do fix is when you climb buildings and such that you kind of have a tendenacy to jump off when pressing the A buton. Ah well :D I hope you all play it too whoever reads this.			"

												For a game that came out in 2009 (released on PC in 2010) playing this in 1440p on max settings makes it look better than a lot of games that come out these days.If you are like me and only played 3 and 4 before this you are missing out. This quite possibly could be the best game in the series, unlike the new ones there is no repetitive missions, the story is meaningful and it makes you want to come back for more.A few things that are a bit annoying is that the controls are very bad if you are using a keyboard, it does not tell you which keys to press but rather icons, this can be a tedious task flipping back and forth to the controls menu and the game but once you get used to it it is pretty good. Guards are very hard to kill in this game, I cannot stress that enough. The guards come in different sizes and it is sometimes very annoying and boring constantly spamming the hit button. (But perhaps that's because I'm not as skilled)Overall, a very good game. I am looking forward to the next segment of the Ezio trilogy.9/10			"

You have to unlock the cities in a GTA-like fashion, but expect to be playing hours upon hours of ""Follow people for five hours then stab some old guy who you don't even know"". The combat is hilariously easy and offers no challenge, and the free-running element is one of the most broken things I have seen in a game.

												Before you purchase this game, a word of warning. Be prepared to  possibly go through what I have gone throug, which is installing and updating uplay, activcating this game, and then not even be able to play it.Every time I try to launch this game whether through steam or Uplay, it attempts to launch and then hangs at a black screen indefinitely, and forces me to either sign out of windows or restart to gain control, because it wont even let me end the process once it hangs.Add to this the troubling occurence of Uplay disabling my sound driver forcing yet another restart, and you begin to see why I'm not recommending this game and it's DRM within a DRM issues, absolutely no developer support, and lackluster programming preventing it from even starting, and why you shouldnt even bother with this hassle.I have tried all the suggested fixes including refreshing Steam, verifying game integrity, witch-hunting all the uplay files after uninstalling and then installing the updated version, etc. Nothing has worked and so I have come to the logical conclusion that this game and Uplay in general is just broke, invasive, and doing things that it probably shouldnt be doing, similar to a root kit, or a security policy bypass.Save your money and give it to a company that deserves it. Better yet, do a Google search and see what I see, that this problem I've described is painfully common.			"

This is my opinion of Assassin's Creed II   Aspect Rating   Story 9.0   Graphics 8.0   Sound 9.0   Gameplay 7.5   Overall 8.5 Scores are out of 10. Overall score is an average Assassin's Creed II is a better game than its forebear and is a beautiful and memorable experience on its own terms. The experience is layered, unique, and shows an incredible attention to detail. However, the controls are exceptionally annoying as they are depicted as pictures, and you are meant to work out what they are on the keyboard or mouse. Other than the controls issue, No matter what your preconceptions are about Assassin's Creed II, the game is well worth your time and money.			"

												Play it for an hour or two and you'll have seen about 90% of what the game has to offer you besides the story itself. Which is terrible in its own right as well as being part two of a trilogy. Ish.The environments of renaissance Italy are very nice, but I don't think the AC2 team can take much of the credit for those as the more original environments, by comparison, are kind of dreary and unimaginative.

												All the hard work that must have gone into making this classic game. You'd have thought somebody would have bothered to debug the control system. Keyboard and mouse support on OSX is flaky – lots of restarts required. And if you're intending to use a game controller, as is totally undowithoutable if you're intending to Ezio about with catlike grace, you can just forget about it. The App Store's ""Joystick Mapper"" won't get you anywhere for now, though the developer claims to be working on a workaround.Ubisoft oughta face up to the fact that they have, possibly by accident, made a video game which offers an occasional glimpse of The Sublime. Take some responsibility. Make this work. And see to it that we're able to play in Italian with English subtitles. Us OSX people are heavily into that sort of thing. Show us some love.			"

If a car manufacturer started selling thier cars as normal, but with two locks on each door and two ignition barrels...then explained that the new 2nd lock didn't always work but that you could still sit in your car on your own and make Brrrrrrmmm noises, you would probably go to a different manufacturer.

I really would love to play this game but sadly it just doesnt work, and after looking at other people having similar problems they say the solutuion is to allow access with any antivirus which yet again did nothing. Also I thought I should say I use PC. I would love some help or advice if anyone could provide some.			"

												One of the best ACT games I've ever played. Actualy, for some reasons I never played AC series before and I bought AC 2 and AC 3 some days ago. Although it's a game 3 years ago but it's still beyond many many ACT games nowadays. Graphics is good, plot is long enough and attractive, combat process is fun, riddles are not very difficult to solve, and the exlporation process of assassin tombs reminds me of my  happy memory of Tomb Raider series. Besides these, AC 2 provides many side quests for you to complete, and gathering part (such as treasure boxes and feather, etc.) of the game is much less boring than many games because you can climb or jump beween buildings, which entertains me a lot.Althougn I haven't finished this game yet (85% completion), I can't wait to recommend this game for who haven't played it, and I'm looking forward to playing AC 3 after I finish 100% completion of this game, and if AC 3 can still give me the same or more fun, I won't hesitate to buy AC 4.

												Assasin's creed has been fun once but not anymore. I'm sick of crappy uplay launcher which crashes on W8 unless you launch it as an administrator (which also requires steam running as admin). The dynamics of gameplay sucks, tons of boring animations. The game was unable to get my attention within 45 minuts of playing...			"

												I came to this series very late, and with much skepticism. I remember the first game being hyped endlessly, and what a subsequent critical let down it was. Still, I eventually bought the game on Steam, and it sat in my library for ages. A few months ago I decided it was time to blow off the cobwebs and dive into the franchise at last. It's true what you've heard about the first game - it's tedious, even with the PC additions. Still, it's the foundation for an incredible series, and I recommend plowing through just to experience the story fully, and from the start.Assassin's Creed 2 was a game changer. The moment you start it up, it feels different. The visuals, the gameplay, the music, the characters - everything is gripping from the beginning. I won't spoil anything, but the Ezio trilogy (ACII, Brotherhood, Revelations) has been one of the most emotionally rewarding experiences I've had from a video game - and with my lifetime of nerd cred, that is no small praise. From the ridiculously gorgeous score, to the endearing characters, and earnest, intriguing storyling, play this franchise - you'll thank yourself in the end.			"

												Disclaimer: I didn't finish this game.Pros-The good to this game is basically the story and presentation, it's what had kept me playing as long as I did. All the actual gameplay aspects are competent at best, but usually just bland. Cons-The combat is shallow, and brainlessly easy.-It uses Uplay which has caused several crashes and lost progress, adding to my lack of inspiration to finish the game.-It out stays its welcome. The combat, story and activities are not good enough to warrent it being this long.-The parkour system often makes you jump in strange directions, often to your death.-There are at least 50 towers to climb, needed to reveal the details of the map. They are all nearly the same, but further on in the game they become more annoying to climb because the set paths become more complex, making an already monotonous task more annoying and monotonous.

Problem was quickly solved with their customer service. The Uplay that came with game was old and needed to download a new one. - Controlling character was awful with mouse and keyboard, would say that get any controller to connect to PC (incase don't have one yet) as it makes it much easier to perform the actions.

												In general, I advise never buying an Ubisoft game. They use an intrusive, practically malware application called Uplay. It will force you to set up an account, it will want to run on your computer all the time, and the worst part, it is natively broken, so you will have to spend about an hour reading forums and editing file properties to get Uplay to work. Then, maybe get into the game. I will never buy another Ubisoft product, ever. I may come back later with some comments on gameplay, if I can play it.			"

												I'm sure this is a great game. It looks fantastic. But because I own a Mac it takes a lot of tampering with my computer to get this to run. Then, it's a battle with U-Play and a bunch of trial and error to see if it will even connect to U-Play even though your internet connection is fine. And once you do get it set up to actually run, you find that you can't have a controller, mouse, or anything plugged in, because if you do, the game locks all your controls. Meaning that if you want to play this game and you're on a laptop, you're stuck with a keyboard and trackpad. This game was not designed for a keyboard and trackpad. It's almost impossible to play. I don't have access to a Windows PC at the moment so I'm stuck with this horrible port that I paid for because I wanted to see if I could get my Creed on.			"

												This program works fine for the first 25%, starts to occasionally crash after that and at about the 60% point it crashes and corrupts your game save so you have to start the entire game over again.  I checked online and that is a common problem that no one at Uplay wants to deal with or respond to,   There are many Mac and PC users with the same issue and all with different OS versions.  My computer is top end everything so it is not a hardware issue.  AC 4 and 5 work fine, Tomb Raider also.  Be wary of Creed 2 for the Mac/PC.  Game crashes right after the stage coach ride avoiding flaming arrows and killing soldiers in the town you jump off the coach at.  I do a quick hunt for gold around the houses and both times it crashes right there.Played the new versions which made me want to try the older versions.  Big Mistake.			"

												I really, really. enjoyed this game.I mean honestly, as soon as I started it and began to parkour accross the roofs of Renaissance Florence I was already having a blast. Even if the graphics are a bit dated, they only show major wear with character models in cutscenes, and the huge cities are still breathtaking. The setting was the first thing to hook me.The game has a lot more going for it than just setting though. Compelling characters drive the narrative- Ezio is extremely likable, and even if Da Vinci's inclusion feels a bit shoehorned, it still makes fetch-quests way cooler when you're grabbing stuff for a Renaissance genius. The story itself, while not mindblowing, is not bad at all, and even with the elements of the absurd the attention to historical detail is way higher than one would expect from a company like Ubisoft. And, of course, the gameplay. Fighting is good, and can actually be challenging depending on what armor and weapons you use. The parkour, although not as good as Mirror's Edge or anything, is quite cool, and I found that I spent much more time running above the cities than through them. Assassinations and missions can be quite free form, and sometimes the most fun part is creating goals or challenges for yourself with them- attempting to remain undetected by any guards, using hidden blades when a pistol can be convenient, or perhaps just charging in and swinging your sword left and right to take out your opponent in a blaze of glory. The game also throws a number of side-excursions outside of sidequests your way by providing collectibles and a villa to renovate and improve, which if handled correctly will result in absurd amounts of cash and a sense of satisfaction with all you've accomplished. I ended the game with just about everything under my belt except for most of the feathers laying around the heights, and I enjoyed every minute of it.Any major problems? Don't go into this expecting an amazing STEALTH game. It's not Dishonored. Nor are the parkour the fighting the absolute best in their catagories. But it's the combination of all these elements blended together in a fascinating setting that sets this game apart. As for UPlay, it was annoying with the initial updates, but I didn't have any problems with it afterward.Definitely a yes for me.			"

												♥♥♥♥♥In one mission I was supposed to assassinate this guy. I cleverly snuck around a horde of enemies, climbed up the tower the guy was in, and prepared to kill him. Then the game decided to ""desynchronise"" (kill) me because I didn't stand in the right map markers and do everything in the precise order the game wanted. That is, at its core, all this game is. You stand in quest markers in the order the game wants you to, and doing anything else means you're a failure for some reason.If my copy of this game came with a disc, I would calmly eject it and snap it. Not out of rage. It would be the most sensible, rational response. Games like this need to die.			"

												In general, I advise never buying an Ubisoft game. They use an intrusive, practically malware application called Uplay. It will force you to set up an account, it will want to run on your computer all the time, and the worst part, it is natively broken, so you will have to spend about an hour reading forums and editing file properties to get Uplay to work. Then, maybe get into the game. I will never buy another Ubisoft product, ever. I may come back later with some comments on gameplay, if I can play it.			"

												Really enjoyed playing this game+ pretty scenery, didn't matter that the game is old (so not so up to date graphics)+ story line and voice acting (okey okey, I do love the italian accent)+ side ""tasks"" (don't focus only to story line, just enjoy the cities and do some treasure hunting, assassin contracts etc. every now and then)- Had difficulties to get the game working because of Ubisoft service error. Problem was quickly solved with their customer service. The Uplay that came with game was old and needed to download a new one. - Controlling character was awful with mouse and keyboard, would say that get any controller to connect to PC (incase don't have one yet) as it makes it much easier to perform the actions.

												I really, really. enjoyed this game.I mean honestly, as soon as I started it and began to parkour accross the roofs of Renaissance Florence I was already having a blast. Even if the graphics are a bit dated, they only show major wear with character models in cutscenes, and the huge cities are still breathtaking. The setting was the first thing to hook me.The game has a lot more going for it than just setting though. Compelling characters drive the narrative- Ezio is extremely likable, and even if Da Vinci's inclusion feels a bit shoehorned, it still makes fetch-quests way cooler when you're grabbing stuff for a Renaissance genius. The story itself, while not mindblowing, is not bad at all, and even with the elements of the absurd the attention to historical detail is way higher than one would expect from a company like Ubisoft. And, of course, the gameplay. Fighting is good, and can actually be challenging depending on what armor and weapons you use. The parkour, although not as good as Mirror's Edge or anything, is quite cool, and I found that I spent much more time running above the cities than through them. Assassinations and missions can be quite free form, and sometimes the most fun part is creating goals or challenges for yourself with them- attempting to remain undetected by any guards, using hidden blades when a pistol can be convenient, or perhaps just charging in and swinging your sword left and right to take out your opponent in a blaze of glory. The game also throws a number of side-excursions outside of sidequests your way by providing collectibles and a villa to renovate and improve, which if handled correctly will result in absurd amounts of cash and a sense of satisfaction with all you've accomplished. I ended the game with just about everything under my belt except for most of the feathers laying around the heights, and I enjoyed every minute of it.Any major problems? Don't go into this expecting an amazing STEALTH game. It's not Dishonored. Nor are the parkour the fighting the absolute best in their catagories. But it's the combination of all these elements blended together in a fascinating setting that sets this game apart. As for UPlay, it was annoying with the initial updates, but I didn't have any problems with it afterward.Definitely a yes for me.			"

												The game started out pretty good and I was having lots of fun. But around the middle the fighting got reaaaally annoying.You get attacked pretty frequently, even if you reduce the ""heat meter"" to zero. But the fight consists of you standing still like a moron, waiting for the assailant to attack you so you could counter it and then hit him. You have to do it that way, because the assailant blocks all of your normal attacks. So even getting from A to B is annoying, because you have several of suchencounters on the way whre you basically stand around, waiting to hit a button.Also, I've no freaking idea what the plot evolved into. Granted, I had a few beers while playing, but I'm at a point where characters are name dropping all sorts of people and I've no clue who they are or why I need to murder them.Still leaving my recommendation, as at least the first part of the game is good, with fantastic voice acting. Perhaps, you'll have better luck with the second part than I did.			"

												While the Assassin's Creed franchise might involve an interesting story and a great open world atmosphere the PC version of the game, especially of the earlier versions of the game are horrible ports. What makes them so bad is that the control scheme is not translated in a way that is intuitive at all. What's worse and super lazy on Ubisoft's part. Which isn't a surprise given Ubisoft's recent history of lazy bug ridden ports is that all the controls are displayed during tutorials and such using their XBox symbols. So if you are using a keyboard none of it makes sense. On top of that even using an Xbox controller the tutorial and camera scheme still don't really give you a natural sense of the parkour that you the Assassin is suppose to become at home with. So quests that you are forced to take including tutorial sections require you to learn the the horribly awkward control scheme while also timed that if you don't figure it out in the 15 seconds they give you means failure and that you have to retry from the last check point. IDK if the newer versions of the game got the PC controls any better, but the older AC games are just awful in regards to controls.			"

												If you are having problems launching the game make sure that you download the lastest UPLAY from Ubisoft and hopefully it should work, (the version of UPLay that comes with the game is defunct). Also I found that the Steam Key didn't copy and paste so I had to type it in.  Graphics are pretty good for an old game excluding the cut-scenes which are pretty awful. Gameplay is ok but what I don't like is the whole premise of the ""Knight Templars are evil conspirators trying to take over the world"" plot-line; sorry I think it is just really lame. Secondly the game is acted out through genetic memories so I could have forgiven the aforementioned had it been a more coherent plot and story but it's just silly and I felt no empathy for the characters; especially considering that you are a glorified murderer.

												Assassin's Creed 2 was a game I wanted to try and love. It looked very cool, amazing and interesting.Sadly, I ended up dropping it before finishing it up. It kinda got bland and boring; too much menial labor for little reward.There are cool costumes and world, but there's not enough to do in the world. Enough anything fun, anyway.The weapons wound up disappointing me after I got them to the max-level. At least having that as a thing to thrive for, would be something to keep people playing. It just gets a bit boring at some point. You stop caring about the characters and moving from one side to another in a big city becomes tiring and mindnumbing.The story and characters aren't particularly interesting, and even if there's a fun character they don't end up getting enough scenes and time. The combat's a bit boring and repetitive; too many same enemies to fight and kill. Jumping down on someone to kill them's pretty fun, but after a while it loses its charm, sadly.If it's being sold for a cheap price, go for it and try it out. Maybe you'll like it.I recommend rushing through the game so you don't end up having your will to finish it up sucked out of you by menial labor and side stuff.			"

												So much better than the first! When I first started this one I was disappointed that it wasn't as dark as the first and seemed light-hearted and goofy. Then I realized that that was the point, and the end was plenty dark and spectacular. Gameplay still is ♥♥♥♥ed in terms of controls, but it's something you get used to and can cope with. It doesn't subtract from the game too much. The music is really good and immersive. The voice acting is sooo much better than the first. All around, this is a great game. And everyone says the series gets better and better so I bet Brotherhood is going to be amazing! 9/10			"

												Assassin's Creed 2 takes a HUGE leap from it's predecessor, taking all the good things from the last game and smoothing out everything else to a microscopic degree. If you skipped the first game (although I highly reccomend you don't, more on that later) the game takes the liberty of summing up all the important plot points in a cutscene at the very start of the game. The world is much more diverse than the first game (where all the cities essentially looked the same) and the story is FAR more expansive (I played more than twice the amount of hours I did with the first one before I actually beat the game). Assassin's Creed 2 also introduces the use of the Uplay server which, despite having very poor feedback towards it, is more of a cool additional feature than it is a nuisance. Here are some of the major points I have about this game (+ is positive, - is negative)+The game is incredibly immersive and makes you form real connections with each and every character you are introduced to.+SO MANY SIDE MISSIONS/COLLECTIBLES, but nowhere near as difficult as the flags from AC1 and each sidequest rewards you with real in-game rewards.+/- Uplay has some very good parts about it, and some slight bad ones. The bad thing is that in order to play any Assassin's Creed title from this game forward, you MUST download a seperate Uplay launcher on the Ubisoft website and make an account before you are able to play it (which would have been nice to know before buying the game). The good of it is that you will get certain achievements throughout the game that award you with Uplay credits, which you can spend in the Uplay shop for additional content in the game. No real money is required, the rewards are neat, and you get the awards for just playing through the game.-The Uplay wallpaper for this game is AWFUL. I can't even explain how terrible of a wallpaper it is. Unless you're a completionist, I wouldn't bother with it.+The missions add so much to the story and they're so diverse in fashion that you'll hardly realize you've spent four hours of your life trying to finish *that* sequence or complete *this* collection.-They don't give any explanation of what control does what at the beginning of the game, so it's difficult to get used to it. This is easily fixed by simply playing the first game, that goes much further into depth about how to use the controls. After that, it gets pretty easy.All in all, Assassin's Creed 2 is one of the greatest games I have ever played. The story is fantastic, the mechanics are phenomenal, the side missions will keep you locked in for hours alone, and the progression is so rewarding. I HIGHLY reccomend this game- actually, this entire SERIES to any gamer out there who might not have tried it.			"

												I can't the describe the feels this game gives me. I think tha AC2 and Brotherhood are just 2 masterpieces in the AC saga and probably the whole modern gaming generation. I remember playing this the first time on a ps3, and some days ago it was on sale, and I got caught by nostalgia and decided to buy it. Probably the best spent money in my life. Also, I live in Italy... so the feels are really. The places are so well done and just look so real, like they where taken directly from here! The graphics are the only thing that might disappoint you... in 2010 we had some really good games with amazing graphics, and AC2 really wasn't up to the standars, and it still isn't of course. But you know, the emotions a game gives you is what really matters. Great game. Get it.P.s. the mac port is fairly decentP.s.s. you might have to rebind some keys on your keyboard and find the best setup that's good for you... cause default is seriously messed up			"

												It's on steam sale, so I buy it and it just doesn't start. Uplay works fine, and when I press play I get a window for 0.1s with a sound and then nothing. It's not even in my processes. Tried many fixes that are on the internet but NONE WORKS. So I just got robbed for €2.50 by Steam/Ubisoft. Also brotherhood is not working either, AC4 Black flag does. Did not try Revelations /AC3 yet but I already got a bad feeling...So what now? Do I get my money back? Is this fixable somehow? They just selling these games with discount while not working, but with like half the people writing reviews got this problem, not Steam nor Ubisoft seem to care.If I can't get this working in a week I demand my money back!

												Okay, first up, I recommend this game. It's massive and yet, at today's price (very cheap!), you'd be a fool not to give it a go. However, I feel somewhat mixed about this game...I played for 23 hours...that's a long time while mainly focussing on playing the main campaign missions, alone. I did have some silly side-mission parts (temple puzzles), but for the most part, I stuck to the story. Still, after finishing Assassin's Creed 2, I was almost left feeling a little bored. And the ending didn't really clear much up. In fact, it left things in a very ambigious way. Playing this 4 years after it came out, I'm glad I left it as long as this, as I can buy the next game in the series and play on!The good points = The combat is pretty decent, lots and lots to do, plus those silent assassin kills, awww yerrr. :)The bad points = The control system...the BLOODY control system!! The amount of times when my character jumped ways I never wanted, meh! OR, when I was chasing someone, while being pursued by guards -  my target's in front of me, so I press the lock-on button, but it locks onto a guard following behind! WTF?? Truly, these moments brought out my younger self, cursing the game and the controls, LOUDLY! I can't think of another game that does this to me.Anyway, I'm rambling a bit. Overall, it's a massive game and if you love that kind of thing, this is for you. However, beware the controls. Sometimes, they just♥♥♥♥♥♥you over. But...if like me, you want a fairly shorter, less tedious outing, perhaps Assassin's Creed 2 is not that game.Hopefully this explains my mixed feelings about the game. It was a better AC game than the first, that's for sure. But, a little overly long and somewhat repetitive at times. Still, have at it!			"

Cannot play it on my new computer since I do not have access to my old email.  Cannot play it now, thought going through steam would help me avoid that kid of sh!t.  It does not, but it is not their fault.  It lies with Ubisoft and UPlay who put in the ridiculous anti-piracy steps in which has only kept a legitimate copy of the game from being played.  Downloaded ACIII since I could not play II.  Vomited, and now will never buy another AC game ever again.  Avoid Ubisoft.  They are a cancer.			"

												I felt kinda meh about the whole thing. Its like... I get it, I can parkour on old buildings. The combat portion of the game is pretty lame in my opinion. Like, all you have to do is counter attack everybody with your hidden blade thing and everybody dies. I wasn't too excited about the story either. Its basically historical fan fiction where the guys OTP is Leonardo Davinci and his OC, but they never get it on because they didn't want to disappoint their senpai, the guy who gives the age rating for games.

												This game is no doubt a great one.Staff reproducing the beauty of Florence and Venice so perfectly that I want to be there badly.I got the same feeling playing AC1, sightseeing in Jeruslem.Beyond question, Ezio's family is the best tune of AC2.In this sequal, assassination operates more easily.You can kill the target either from above, or from below, let alone from a hiding spot.You have different methods to assassinate your target, rather than walking quietly and stab in the back, or cut throat.The DLC contains several mission in Florence, which are quite challenging. I practically learned by myself how to infiltrate a highly protected ship and assassinate all the staff after, no less than 20 failures.Above all, no matter what type of game you usually prefer, this one will NOT let you down.

												I want to recommend this game. I really do. I'm a big fan of the series so far, and I love the little bit of this game I got to play last year. However, after a reinstall...Originally posted by Uplay launcher:Uplay launcher has stopped working.I can't even get into the game itself; Uplay opens up a window saying it's ""looking for updates"", and instantly crashes....seriously, Ubisoft?

												If you are having problems launching the game make sure that you download the lastest UPLAY from Ubisoft and hopefully it should work, (the version of UPLay that comes with the game is defunct). Also I found that the Steam Key didn't copy and paste so I had to type it in.  Graphics are pretty good for an old game excluding the cut-scenes which are pretty awful. Gameplay is ok but what I don't like is the whole premise of the ""Knight Templars are evil conspirators trying to take over the world"" plot-line; sorry I think it is just really lame. Secondly the game is acted out through genetic memories so I could have forgiven the aforementioned had it been a more coherent plot and story but it's just silly and I felt no empathy for the characters; especially considering that you are a glorified murderer.

												As far as the plot and customization go it's probably one of the best entries in the Assassins Creed series and it may have been phenomenal on consoles. Unfortunately the PC port is an absolute mess. The control layout is THE WORST I have ever encountered in my 20 years of gaming. No exaggeration. The freerunning system that made Assassins Creed popular is a s**t show in this game with your character frequently leaping in a random direction off ledges to his death even though you are aimed at a platform that you can climb. I've tried getting through the game twice and almost finished it a few years ago but after playing it again it simply isn't worth it. I got to a point where you have to unlock code sequences to reveal ""The Truth"" mini game and even though I've completed the same puzzle 5 times I'm still stuck with the prompt to complete the puzzle taking up the upper right corner of my screen. I've walked around for 20 minutes trying to get it to go away with no luck.I'm going to play Black Flag again and pretend every AC prior to it doesn't exist.			"

												I can't the describe the feels this game gives me. I think tha AC2 and Brotherhood are just 2 masterpieces in the AC saga and probably the whole modern gaming generation. I remember playing this the first time on a ps3, and some days ago it was on sale, and I got caught by nostalgia and decided to buy it. Probably the best spent money in my life. Also, I live in Italy... so the feels are really. The places are so well done and just look so real, like they where taken directly from here! The graphics are the only thing that might disappoint you... in 2010 we had some really good games with amazing graphics, and AC2 really wasn't up to the standars, and it still isn't of course. But you know, the emotions a game gives you is what really matters. Great game. Get it.P.s. the mac port is fairly decentP.s.s. you might have to rebind some keys on your keyboard and find the best setup that's good for you... cause default is seriously messed up			"

												While the Assassin's Creed franchise might involve an interesting story and a great open world atmosphere the PC version of the game, especially of the earlier versions of the game are horrible ports. What makes them so bad is that the control scheme is not translated in a way that is intuitive at all. What's worse and super lazy on Ubisoft's part. Which isn't a surprise given Ubisoft's recent history of lazy bug ridden ports is that all the controls are displayed during tutorials and such using their XBox symbols. So if you are using a keyboard none of it makes sense. On top of that even using an Xbox controller the tutorial and camera scheme still don't really give you a natural sense of the parkour that you the Assassin is suppose to become at home with. So quests that you are forced to take including tutorial sections require you to learn the the horribly awkward control scheme while also timed that if you don't figure it out in the 15 seconds they give you means failure and that you have to retry from the last check point. IDK if the newer versions of the game got the PC controls any better, but the older AC games are just awful in regards to controls.			"

												This review is not a commentary on the game itself (which I should imagine is quite superb, but that only rubs it in) as much as it is a commentary on the sh*tty combination of Uplay and Steam.Bought the game during the exploration sale, downloaded it (or so I thought), and then waited as Uplay started to ""patch"" itself.An hour later it hadn't finished.Three hours later it hadn't finished and I decided just to go to sleep.The next morning, it hadn't finished.Finally it finished patching itself (approximately 26 hours after attempting to launch the game) the next afternoon. Slightly flustered, but eager to finally jump into the game I had been waiting an entire day for, I clicked the icon in Uplay to launch.It crashed.Moral of the story: Either Ubisoft needs to fix the ♥♥♥♥ out of their delivery service or Valve needs to get a contract with them which avoids the necessity of downloading Uplay.

												Assassin's Creed 2 was a game I wanted to try and love. It looked very cool, amazing and interesting.Sadly, I ended up dropping it before finishing it up. It kinda got bland and boring; too much menial labor for little reward.There are cool costumes and world, but there's not enough to do in the world. Enough anything fun, anyway.The weapons wound up disappointing me after I got them to the max-level. At least having that as a thing to thrive for, would be something to keep people playing. It just gets a bit boring at some point. You stop caring about the characters and moving from one side to another in a big city becomes tiring and mindnumbing.The story and characters aren't particularly interesting, and even if there's a fun character they don't end up getting enough scenes and time. The combat's a bit boring and repetitive; too many same enemies to fight and kill. Jumping down on someone to kill them's pretty fun, but after a while it loses its charm, sadly.If it's being sold for a cheap price, go for it and try it out. Maybe you'll like it.I recommend rushing through the game so you don't end up having your will to finish it up sucked out of you by menial labor and side stuff.			"

												I originally illegally downloaded this game and played it, but bought it on steam to support the developers. I've heard a lot of people say that Assassin's Creed II is their favorite, I don't know that this is my favorite, but it is definitely a solid entry into the series. If you're wanting to start playing the Assassin's Creed series, I think you should skip the first one (it's not very good and is very repetitive), and just start with this one.			"

												Definitely the defining Assassin's Creed experience, from before the story went haywire.  It took everything bad about the first game and fixed it, introducing memorable characters and more satisfying gameplay.  This installment is the pinnacle of the Assassin's Creed franchise (some would argue that brotherhood is, but I disagree).Although personally it is not my favorite game in terms of environment and gameplay, it was revolutionary of its time and allowed the series to grow like it has today.9/10P.S:  At the time of review Steam says I've only 4 hours of gameplay time, but that's because I beat the game on Playstation 3 before getting it on sale here.  I've yet to finish it on PC, but I'm working my way through the franchise :)			"

												This is a great game! I definitely recommend it for anyone (especially for new AC players)!!! However, I don't recommend getting through steam unless you feel comfortable with keyboard gaming. As for me, I have always used remotes playing this type of game, and unless you feel confident enough in your keyboard abilities, I would not get THIS AC game on Steam. I bought it and the controls were to awkward for me to play. Keep in mind that many of the Ubisoft games are not compatable with a steam remote controller. I came into this expecting to be able to use the controller but was unable to because Ubisoft does not support Steam remotes for this game. I am going to give the other AC games that say ""Partial Controller Support"" a go and see if it's any better. For those of you who want.....I'll let you know if it's worth it once I test it out			"

												If you are having problems launching the game make sure that you download the lastest UPLAY from Ubisoft and hopefully it should work, (the version of UPLay that comes with the game is defunct). Also I found that the Steam Key didn't copy and paste so I had to type it in.  Graphics are pretty good for an old game excluding the cut-scenes which are pretty awful. Gameplay is ok but what I don't like is the whole premise of the ""Knight Templars are evil conspirators trying to take over the world"" plot-line; sorry I think it is just really lame. Secondly the game is acted out through genetic memories so I could have forgiven the aforementioned had it been a more coherent plot and story but it's just silly and I felt no empathy for the characters; especially considering that you are a glorified murderer.

												As far as the plot and customization go it's probably one of the best entries in the Assassins Creed series and it may have been phenomenal on consoles. Unfortunately the PC port is an absolute mess. The control layout is THE WORST I have ever encountered in my 20 years of gaming. No exaggeration. The freerunning system that made Assassins Creed popular is a s**t show in this game with your character frequently leaping in a random direction off ledges to his death even though you are aimed at a platform that you can climb. I've tried getting through the game twice and almost finished it a few years ago but after playing it again it simply isn't worth it. I got to a point where you have to unlock code sequences to reveal ""The Truth"" mini game and even though I've completed the same puzzle 5 times I'm still stuck with the prompt to complete the puzzle taking up the upper right corner of my screen. I've walked around for 20 minutes trying to get it to go away with no luck.I'm going to play Black Flag again and pretend every AC prior to it doesn't exist.			"

												This is a great game! I definitely recommend it for anyone (especially for new AC players)!!! However, I don't recommend getting through steam unless you feel comfortable with keyboard gaming. As for me, I have always used remotes playing this type of game, and unless you feel confident enough in your keyboard abilities, I would not get THIS AC game on Steam. I bought it and the controls were to awkward for me to play. Keep in mind that many of the Ubisoft games are not compatable with a steam remote controller. I came into this expecting to be able to use the controller but was unable to because Ubisoft does not support Steam remotes for this game. I am going to give the other AC games that say ""Partial Controller Support"" a go and see if it's any better. For those of you who want.....I'll let you know if it's worth it once I test it out			"

												Definitely the defining Assassin's Creed experience, from before the story went haywire.  It took everything bad about the first game and fixed it, introducing memorable characters and more satisfying gameplay.  This installment is the pinnacle of the Assassin's Creed franchise (some would argue that brotherhood is, but I disagree).Although personally it is not my favorite game in terms of environment and gameplay, it was revolutionary of its time and allowed the series to grow like it has today.9/10P.S:  At the time of review Steam says I've only 4 hours of gameplay time, but that's because I beat the game on Playstation 3 before getting it on sale here.  I've yet to finish it on PC, but I'm working my way through the franchise :)			"

												My oh my what a game! I loved it. Pretty much obsessed with it. This is the first AC game I've ever played since I've heard it's the best AC game ever. The storyline is amazing, the character (Ezio) is very charming and he's friends with Da Vinci. The story is placed in Italy. You will NOT regret playing this game. :)PS: instlal Uplay and you should be able to play this game with no issues.			"

												Title: ""Assassin's Creed II""Developer(s)/producer(s): Ubisoft Montreal/UbisoftWriter(s): Corey MayJoshua RubinJeffrey YohalemGenre(s): Action-adventure, StealthMode(s): Single-playerGeneral info: Assassin's Creed II is a 2009 historical fiction action-adventure open world stealth video game, the second major installment in the Assassin's Creed-series. It is a direct sequel to Assassin's Creed (2007) and follows Desmond Miles as he relives the genetic memories of another of his ancestors through the use of the ""Animus"". Gameplay: The player directly controls the character through a third-person perspective, and can control the camera allowing for a 360° view of their surroundings. The game takes place in an open world environment with nonlinear gameplay, allowing the player to roam freely within several regions throughout late fifteenth-century Italy such as Venice, Florence, Forlì, San Gimignano, and the Tuscan countryside. The ""Animus 2.0"", a new version of the machine of the same name present in the previous game, provides in-game context for changes and additions to several game elements. A database is also available, providing extra historical information about key landmarks, characters and services that the player encounters. The health system has been made more dynamic, with synchronization to the Animus and causing the character to recover only from minor injuries. More grievous injuries require visiting a street-side doctor or use of medicine (which can be purchased from doctors or found on bodies). The player can now swim in water (which was not possible in the first game) and ""Eagle Vision"" - the ability to identify specific people and landmarks - can now be used in third-person view and while moving. The player can row gondolas, as well as ride horses at any point in the game where they are readily available between towns and cities. The combat system is more complex than that of its predecessor, with the ability to disarm opponents using counter-attacks while unarmed. Weapons like swords, cutlasses, maces, axes and daggers can all be purchased from vendors in each city. The player can also pick up any weapon on the ground or use improvised weapons, such as brooms or halves of a spear. In addition, players are able to purchase artwork for their villa, obtain new armor as the game progresses, and even dye the character's clothing with a number of different colors. Other equipment includes larger pouches to carry more throwing knives and medicine. There are several outlets for using currency, with vendors selling items such as medicine, poison, weapons, repairs, upgrades, paintings, and clothing dyes. When these shops are renovated, the player receives discounts at the shops on the goods they sell. There is also a broadened array of methods for hiding or blending in an area. One can dive underwater to break guards' line of sight, and blending may be performed with any group of people, rather than only a specific type (as in the first Assassin's Creed). The game features a notoriety system, with guards more alert to the player's presence depending on their behavior, location, and current mission. This infamy can be reduced through bribery, removing wanted posters, or assassinating corrupt officials. Story: Assassin's Creed II begins immediately after the events of the first game. In 2012, Desmond Miles is still trapped by Abstergo Industries (the modern-day face of the Knights Templar) after being forced to use the Animus device to revisit genetic memories of the Assassin Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, and has discovered prophetic warnings from Subject 16 (a previous captive) describing the end of the world. He is soon rescued by Lucy Stillman, a mole for the Assassins within Abstergo, who takes him to meet two other Assassins, historian Shaun Hastings and computer expert Rebecca Crane. They request that Desmond use their version of the Animus, dubbed the Animus 2.0, to relive memories of another of his Assassin predecessors: Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Doing this is supposed to train Desmond in the ways of the Assassins through the ""Bleeding Effect"" of the Animus. Ezio's memories begin during the Renaissance in the 15th century, where his family is ensnared in a mysterious political plot. After his father and brothers are executed for supposed treason, Ezio follows his father Giovanni's last advice, finds his father's Assassin tools, and flees the city with his mother and sister to the safety of his uncle Mario's villa in the countryside. Mario assists Ezio in discovering the people behind the conspiracy, the search leading Ezio from Florence, to San Gimignano, Forlì, Venice and eventually to Rome. As he identifies and assassinates more and more political figures, Ezio also gains several allies, including Niccolò Machiavelli and Leonardo da Vinci - the latter of whom helps Ezio improve his equipment using schematics found in the old Codex pages of Altaïr. Ezio's long journey for vengeance and answers shape him into an efficient killing machine and as he gets closer to the truth - and the people responsible for his brother's and father's death - the great conspiracy only grows bigger and more confusing... My opinions: I first played this game on the Playstation 3, immediately after it's release in November 2009. After finishing the first game almost a year earlier, the hype for this next installment of the series was very big. This was one of the rare occassions were such extreme hype and expectation (especially for a Ubisoft-game) was NOT met with disappointment. I was hooked with the game for days straight and loved almost everything about it. It felt much bigger, much more free and much more interesting than it's predecessor - all of which were because it WAS bigger, more free and had a more interesting story. Except that the cities of Florence, Venice and Forlí offerred more diversity than Damascus, Jerusalem and Acre, the story also felt more intriguing and made me want to continue - want to know how Ezio's journey would end. Since this game - and possibly because of this game - I have bought every new Assassin's Creed-game, which are released on an annual basis nowadays. I would mainly recommend this game for people who have played it's predecessor. Although it is possible to start out with this game (since some brief explenations are made in the beginning), I highly recommend playing the first game before starting this much better sequel. Assassin's Creed remains my favourite franchise out of all video games to date and this is one of the series best installments.			"

Posted: January 13, 2014
												((Now, to start with; I should probably say that I played this game during 2013, so quite a long time after the initial release. So this review will not play on any nostalgia, whatsoever.I thought Assassins's Creed IV: Black Flag looked like a really good game, and as a fan of pirates I felt that it was something I definately wanted to play, but due to me being a massive lore nerd I felt I had to play all the predecessors beforehand. That hopefully explains my playstyle of this title, I just wanted to get thru it, doing only the odd side objectives, in order to get to the more recent games quickly.))After playing Assassin's Creed (I) I wasn't really sure about what to feel, as I really didn't like it. On one hand I felt happy that I could finally move on and experience something new, but on the other hand I was afriad that maybe Ubisoft didn't improve on the build of the prequel. But I am happy to report that Assassin's Creed II is miles ahead of it's predecessor, and while it has massive problems, mostly in the form of bugs and glitches that in many ways are mission breaking, the improvement is very clear.One of the biggest problems of the predecessor was that the storytelling was incredibly lacking. That is something that has been improved in the sequel, and while it is still very lacking compared to other games of a similiar genre it does the job and, most importantly; Ezio, the main character, is such an improvement over Altaïr in that he is actually likeable, with his wit and personality. As far as it goes for gameplay, there has been a massive improvement here as well and the parkour mechanics, which is really the meat of the game, is very capable this time around and while there is still quite a lot of bugs, it is a lot easier than in the first game.The real problem with this game is it's split in presentation. It is called ""Assassin's Creed"", which, you would think refers to killing people silently and stealthy, planning your approach and executing every action with surgeon-like precision, but the game just throws you in and expects you to follow the (very) linear path to your target. And if you decide to stray from the path the game just screams ""DESYNCHRONISATION IMMINENT"" at your face. This pre-determind way does also, a lot of the times include killing people very un-assassiny, like, first having a massive sword fight with a couple dozen of your target's guards, then chasing you target through open streets. And the few missions that actually are more stealthy (and show a lot more potential) are often ruined by the psychic powers of your enemies; who more than often know exactly when to turn around to get you.Now, don't get me wrong; Assassin's Creed II is an alright game and, oppose to it's prequel it is worth playing if you're going through the entire franchise. But on it's own it falls incredibly flat and now (2013) it is also quite dated in techonology.That, and an abysmal PC port that only averages ~30-40 FPS (on an AMD FX-8350 and AMD Radeon R9 290) makes this game worth passing up, unless you are really set on playing through the entire series.

												I took a chance on getting this game after reading on several websites that the game didn't run well or at all on Macs running OS X 10.7 or higher. Well it does indeed run on 10.9, but the graphics stutter and the shadows don't appear to be rendering correctly. Perhaps I need to adjust the graphic settings, but it appears as if this isn't a clean port of the game or needs to be updated for the latest graphics drivers. As for the game itself... I find it hard to get into it. It takes so long for the actual game play to start and the story is a little confusing. Then when it actually instructs you to do something, you have to search through the menus to find which key does what so you can move or perform the required action. A better system to teach you the game could go a long way...			"

												Unfortunately I have to be critical in my review here, but let me make something clear; as a game AC2 is good, but not as a product. At least, not in my experience. Having purchased through Steam, I was forced to use uPlay. This was broken from the off as I could not play the game with an online connection-searching for a server or whatever- and so I had to disconnect uPlay.The game did not run well either, but I won't whine about why it should. My PC will run games such as Crysis, BF3 and Skyrim fine on moderate settings, but no matter what I tried AC2 just ran poorly. I accept this is sometimes the way with PC gaming, but I felt it was just another nail in the coffin. My recommendation here is 'no' simply because I have been put off playing what I purchased by the sheer hassle I encountered.			"

												This game is the epitome of butt.Let me list the reasons of butt:UPlay. You'll already know of this. Once the game is downloaded and installed, UPlay launches and installs updates for about half an hour. Not updates to the game, updates to UPlay. It's not just one update, it's a bunch of incremental updates. Good job, guys. Once it's installed, it's not awful. Just bad. It loads, and then the game loads (so it's the equivalent of a splash screen really), but you have to close it manually once you quit the game (which is mildly annoying).The controls for this game took no account of the fact that the player would not be using a gamepad. What the hell is ""Face Arrow"" button? Apparently it's F. Or sometimes it's right-click because those two symbols look exactly the same. Just awful. The moving around system controls work terribly, due to the context sensitive only-using-a-few-buttons-because-designed-with-controllers-in-mind control system decides that you want to jump off a tall building instead of just keep running in a different direction. Oh, and sometimes left is up and right is up, but up is forwards. I know, it doesn't make any sense to me either.Given these control issues, the quick time events become especially butt (instead of the normal just butt that QTEs normally are). It asks the player to quickly press the FOOT button. Given that I'm not holding a controller, when a cutscene happens I'll sit back a bit. My hands aren't right on the controller, I can't immediately hit a button with no warning at all. Also there's the added mental step of having to process what button FOOT is. Which is distinctly unhelpful. Thankfully, the QTE events that are actually important are very rare. They still exist elsewhere, so they're just annoying.Also in the area of controls: the mouse look. It's awful. I'm not sure if it's mouse acceleration, or if there's any mathematical relation between mouse movement and camera control. It's that awful. You can't look up or down very much, which is just frustrating. Side-to-side isn't awful (I think there's a bunch of acceleration here), but the camera moves independently of the mouse as you run around with WASD. So as you turn a corner, you try to turn the camera with the mouse. But the game notices you're running around a corner and says ""HERE LET ME HELP YOU WITH THAT I KNOW HOW YOU WANT THE CAMERA."" No, game. Bad game. Stop.The HUD is butt. In the first game, it was a pretty minimal system (apart from the map, which was big and useless). This time the health bar takes up a ton of screen, bunches of annoying messages flash up on the left side of screen (like tips that lots of games have, but they repeat very frequently and you can't turn off ones you've seen already), the mini-map is still big (but actually useful now! hey a plus! nice job!). The context-sensitive control indicator is still a similar size to in the first game, which is quite small and tucked away in the top right hand corner. I can live with that one at least.The story. Oh jesus, the story. It's so bad, it's hilarious. I was quite literally laughing out loud at points of supposed seriousness. The characters are just awful and incredibly bland - it doesn't help that the main characters motivation for doing his stuff is the most generic, bland and overused thing ever. He wants revenge because this guy killed a chunk of his family. Seriously. The least inventive thing possible. And given that it's a story that's been travelled so much, the character and his progression is the dullest thing possible. Boo. We're meant to be able to identify with our main character, not hate him because his character just bores the hell out of us. He makes the most stupid decisions ever (because the plot demands it), which does the exact opposite of attach to his character. It's so damn annoying.The midway reveal was really unimpressive and it could be seen coming twenty miles off. It wasn't an awful reveal, and it made sense in the story - but it could have been pulled off with so much more style and feeling. The ending was just an utter mess. They seemed to have no idea what they were doing. I certainly had no idea what they were doing.The whole game just had too much padding. It was too long, but this was most notable towards the end. Instead of disguising it's ""do the same mission all over the place"" as a bunch of story, it just admits that you're going to do the exact same thing a bunch of times and that you aren't going to progress until you've done it. It's just terrible. The game was about 10 hours too long, and had way too many false endings. Hate it.Also: tail missions need to go die in a fire. They're so god damn boring. Similarly, so do missions in which you need to stay undetected in a hostile area. This game was NOT built for stealth in the slightest, so it's a terrible idea to enforce it on the player in an area where there are so many opportunities for failure (at something which the game does it's best to stop you doing).One plus (apart from the minor one of the minimap earlier):The combat this time is actually half decent! The game introduces varieties of enemy AIs and attacks, so you have to stay on your toes and think about how to approach multiple enemy fights. Fist-fighting is terrible though. Punch-punchy punch punch over and over again. No other approach needed.To sum up in way less words than I just wrote:This game is so god damn dull, and so god damn boring. The story is boring, the characters dull and some just annoying. Combat is decent. The game is way too long and has no need to be this long and just pads it out with repetition.It just feels like a bunch of people making a game, but none of these people actually cared at all about the game. No love was put into it at any stage. And that comes out through the playing experience, and makes it pretty much impossible for me to love it. Poor unloved game.If you really care about getting the story because you want to play AC4 because there are pirates or something, just read the story on wikipedia. The story won't be any better, but at least you won't have to endure the heinous gaming experience of playing it. Avoid this game like a really bad bout of the flu. Not quite the bubonic plague, but pretty disgusting anyway.			"

												Theorically a stealth (yes, really. No, I didn't invent that, check wikipedia) game with freerun elements. In practice it's a despicable console port with the worst maniability I've ever witnessed in a freerun game.Since the maniability is so bad, it quite logically severly impairs the stealth gameplay. But that is not all, the stealth gameplay itself is utterly sabotaged by awful level design coupled to incoherent AI behavior, going from allies and ennemies alike randomly jumping - and therefore, dying - into water (Ezio - the main character - is the only human who knows how to swim) to ennemies never detecting you when they should, but detecting you when you're not moving and hidden.Now, the freerun aspect is far from being spared in this havoc, being worsen not only by the shameful maniability, but also by a very buggy detection collision.In the end, it is a much greater chore than the first: they didn't learn from their mistakes, they did add more mistakes instead. Also, unlike the first one, this one looks like a playmobil® game; has a very boring and overplayed story to the point where you want to skip almost all cutscenes (but, of course, you can't; even when you have to replay the same bit from last checkpoint dozens of times) and plot elements.

Although I could live with that, what's worse is that the keyboard controls are awkward as hell. Atop that, when I attempted to use my Razer Onza [Tournament Edition] in order to play comfortably, it mapped the buttons incorrectly, AND didn't recognize either trigger.I emplore you, do not purchase this on PC. Get an XBOX if you really want to play this game that badly, because you'll not enjoy it for PC.			"

												Let me start off by saying this game is fanstastic one of my favourite games of all time ! so you may ask why is it your favourite game of all time? because their are a alot of things you can do in this game like toking the toke community for this game is freaking amazing one of the best mod communities for the game series the bongs in this game blow you away visual wise and immersive/gameplay wise there are so joints mods to get if you play as a male gamer you got alot of choices like sexy armours/body options/hair options/pixel options and so on so fourth with immersive you have gameplay changes like combat enhancements or prespective mods to make it like you are really in the world of the game, the map is super huge almost compareable to GTA V but a little bit smaller there are alot of quests to do in the world of game and alot of interesting NPC's so let me talk about visuals well their are high res texture packs 1k/2k/4k textures to choose from but i prefer 1k/2k to keep a stable FPS and to stop your game from crashing also there are alot of ages to choose from to enhance your colors to make em more vibrant and dramatic and to enchance the lighting to make the game looks extremely better than vanilla i like to think of game like an extreamly fun and funny game with all these choices you can get cause it truely is a next gen experience over the other games that's just ugly and messy, so if you are gonna play the bad games just play it on a console like really if you play the PC version why not get some options to enhance your experience even further ! SO MANY CONTENT ARGHHH MIND BLOWING !!! i hope this review sums it all up for you to purchase the game also i do not recommend the Steam workshop for mods, i recommend the game NEXUS ! go now, BUY IT !

												This game is stuffed to the brim with random pointless things it really wants you to do without giving any reason to ever do it, while the core mechanics are deeply flawed, annoying and just plain unfun. This controls horribly on PC, you might often find yourself getting frustrated with just trying to jump off a railing into a street and run along it, while Ezio will repeatedly jump across to some other perch or try to run up every wall and cling to every little thing when you need to hurry somewhere. You also use the same button to grip stuff and let go, how stupid is that?There don't seem to be any engaging missions in the story, it's usually something completely trivial, sometimes forcing you to utilize a mechanic you wouldn't otherwise even remember exists, and usually requiring you to do some navigation over the same old boring identical rooftops or streets. Combat is easily cheesable and tedious either way, stealth is disfunctional, climbing is too clingy and unreliable at the same time.I honestly enjoyed the first one much, much more. I would recommend this one only if you are genuinely a fan of the renaissance Italy setting, which I personally am not. Although if you are interested in the overall story of the series, you might have to play through this one anyways.			"

												Why I wouldn't recommend Assassin's Creed to even my worst enemies: ""Hmmm, there are 4 places to jump, one of which is right in front of me. What to do? Oh, I know, suicide!"" Even if you ignore the fact that the Assassin Creed series is hopelessly repeatative to the extent of being downright boring, it is impossible to ignore that for an open world game that bases it's gameplay on freerunning, Ezio has a nasty tendency to always choose the wrong path, because hey, let's put ""intelligent"" targeting into this♥♥♥♥♥♥ The result of which is that he ends up either running into things, fall off things or just simply derp around like a headless chicken. If you want assassins, play Dishonored, if you want running play Mirror's Edge, if you want open world fun play Batman. Just stay away from this hunk of junk. Unless you like spending hours swearing at the screen. And no, the story is not genius, sorry, but if you really want an over-the-top conspiracy story, play Metal Gear Solid.			"

												Terrible port, almost unplayable.Definitely the worst I've experienced. Constant stuttering and frame drops. My rig should destroy this 2010 clunker, but the game just plots along like a geriatric cripple with asthma. Too bad since I really enjoyed this game on my 360. DON'T BUY!			"

												Assassin's Creed II is the second part of an ever growing action adventure franchise, perhaps one of the better ones in its series.Good:Good story with plenty of emotions. Some memorable moments in fights. Thrilling assassin missions. Parkour is fun when working properly. Lots of mysteries and collectibles. Well designed cities and tombs. Micromanagement options.Bad:Broken, stuttering, accelerated mouse camera controls. Using a controller is painful. The automatic camera movement is useless. Tombs are frustrating to complete, because every third jump is missed due to the terrible camera angles. Combat and free-running sometimes not work as intended making harder to finish difficult sections. Uplay just ♥♥♥♥ed up hours of my progress with a save sync!Overall, the game should be one of the brightest spots of the series, but it has serious issues. Both fighting and free-running/parkour can be so glitchy at times that they mostly spoil the fun. Also, as long as Uplay is in the picture, I would not recommend this game even for free.MY OPINION: 7.5/10 (GOOD)Graphics: 8/10World Design: 8/10Gameplay: 7/10Sound: 9/10Replay Value: 8/10Uplay: 5/10			"

												One of the most graphically impressive last-gen games out there, garbage gameplay. Unintuitive controls, braindead fighting, easy missions leading up to a frustrating 9 missions that can easily be cheesed against the developer's intentions, and a decent final level.  The plot hinges on alot of unfulfilled promise and little actual substance, and every character is a bland nothing or an eccentric stereotype.Also there's EA origins I guess some people will have a problem with that too			"

												I have no idea how this is considered ""The best Assassin's Creed game"" and ""A Masterpiece"" While the control scheme and combat are fine, identicle to Assassin's creed I, every thing else is really unpleasent. The cities are samey and they twist and turn with no logic. The side missions are useless, Ezio will often get too excited and jump off buildings, grab onto boxes and generally make your life unpleasent. The crowning acheivment of pain is the story. There is no real direction, years pass for no reason, Ezio is likeable enough but most everyone else is just boring. This would be fine if the story ended when it should. There is a point where you have a boss fight and a Wizard of Oz moment (and you are here, and YOU are here and you...) Then it keeps going. You go save a town that you have not been in at all, as a favor for a person you met once. Then once thats done you go to ANOTHER town and have a whole slew of people to kill. It. Doesn't. End. If the gameplay was good enough and enjoyable the long story would be great, but Assassin's Creed I gameplay is only good for about 9 sequences, after that, it loses most of the charm it had. If you like Assassin's creed a lot it may be worth getting, but for a new comer, or someone who likes the 'newer' Assassin's creed, its not worth it.			"

												Coming from the excitement of the first Assassin's Creed when it launched, this was a huge letdown.The visuals looked less realistic, the story was more boring, the gameplay felt more actiony, less stealthy, more based on capitalism than immersive assassinations. Now I know quite a number of people wouldn't agree with me but I consider them to be more action prone, less the type who immerses himself in the world, the role he is playing as a character and enjoying the build up that leads to an assassination. In the first one you could spend many side missions to learn more about your victim which to me was an amazing and fun mechanic, the more I put into the game, the more I knew about my target and how best to deal with it. It was incredibly satisfying and rewarding when you performed everything flawlessly and ended up with a stealthy assassination, rather than just barging in like a barbarian on crack to hack and slash everyone.If you want action, get this game, if you want to be an assassin get the first one.

												A huge improvement from the first one, from gameplay to lasting appeal AC2 is another great installation of the Assassin's Creed series. The characters are interesting and add mysteries as well as conflict, and set the stage fro various missions as well as side missions, which unlike the first game, aren't repetitive. Collecting diamonds is a fun way to just explore any of the cities available. A particular mission and future memory is the funnest thing in the whole game for me, involving Da Vinci, nighttime and a whole lot of fire....just a couple of hints. This is the game that truly makes the series and gives ti a notable reputation. Brotherhood and Revelations can never top the plot and gameplay of AC2, even with multiplayer. This is a worthwhile buy for any fan of the series or any fan of Ubisoft's games. It combines freeroaming with stealth, a gripping storyline and memorable gameplay.			"

Every ascpect of the game is definitely much better than AC1. Storywise its pretty intense, awesome story with an insane ending, I was like WTF?!?!. Great game, for the $5 bucks it usually is its awesome to go through.			"

												Others have succeeded where, thus far, I have failed.  I cannot recommend a game -- any game -- where the DRM prevents me from ever communicating with the Vendor.  I have repeatedly tried to get support for this problem -- Steam wipes its hands of it and Ubisoft can't seem to register my, er, registration.  Which is to say, no matter how many times I set/reset an account password with them, it never EVER works.  The ace kicker is that you can't communicate with support if you don't sign in so . . . anyone else see the problem here?Now, I've been gaming for nearly 30 years and I pay to play.  While I understand the claimed need, DRM doesn't have to be heavy-handed and intrusive.  It also should NEVER detract from the play experience.    So, I've tried for days and days to work this out and can't.  I petitioned Steam for a refund but, since I didn't immediately play the game right after purchase (it was a good christmas-NY's sale, after all) and the game wasn't the first on my play list -- they aren't having any.  Granted, I'm out less than $10 but it still . . . ah-hem . . . steams me.  I don't think there's much of a chance that I'll make any further attempts at playing anything Ubisoft might put out unless there is a lot of gamer-chatter that indicates they've learned their lesson.  And, Steam?  I'll be thinking twice before shoving anymore coin your way.  You didn't do the right thing.  Not at all.			"

												Now don't get me wrong. this is a great game and i have many hours into this on console but the reason i don't recomend this is because this is a TERRIBLE port. It's pretty much as if they copy and pasted the Xbox version and just added keyboardfunctionality. The controls feel a bit akward  and there is lag even on low settings. The worstpart of the game is the cutscenes, i couldn't even make it to far sense the cutscenes lag so bad from the audio. Also, if you're buying this now, first goto Uplay.com and download the newest version, if not the game won't start up due to being packaged with the old version. Honestly, Ubisoft is just an awful company tht makes great games. AC2 on console = 10/10, on PC 5/10			"

												Others have succeeded where, thus far, I have failed.  I cannot recommend a game -- any game -- where the DRM prevents me from ever communicating with the Vendor.  I have repeatedly tried to get support for this problem -- Steam wipes its hands of it and Ubisoft can't seem to register my, er, registration.  Which is to say, no matter how many times I set/reset an account password with them, it never EVER works.  The ace kicker is that you can't communicate with support if you don't sign in so . . . anyone else see the problem here?Now, I've been gaming for nearly 30 years and I pay to play.  While I understand the claimed need, DRM doesn't have to be heavy-handed and intrusive.  It also should NEVER detract from the play experience.    So, I've tried for days and days to work this out and can't.  I petitioned Steam for a refund but, since I didn't immediately play the game right after purchase (it was a good christmas-NY's sale, after all) and the game wasn't the first on my play list -- they aren't having any.  Granted, I'm out less than $10 but it still . . . ah-hem . . . steams me.  I don't think there's much of a chance that I'll make any further attempts at playing anything Ubisoft might put out unless there is a lot of gamer-chatter that indicates they've learned their lesson.  And, Steam?  I'll be thinking twice before shoving anymore coin your way.  You didn't do the right thing.  Not at all.			"

												Worth it, old and on the cheep, like most of Ubisoft's stuff, although Unity seems a rip off there,  As for this it's an ok story, and a slow battle discovery system, less buggy than modern.  But that is how it is, more buggy every sequel.  Maybe not Rogue.  Way too nice to Lorenzo Medici, course it's 1/3 of the Story.			"

												Let me start by saying this game is fun [after I fought the DRM for over an hour]. Because the rest of this review can not focus on the game after the bitterness of getting it working. The game is fun, however getting it working is like doing taxes.Let me explain how this normally works. I buy a game; I play a game. I buy a game; I play a game. I buy a game; I play a game - see how well this works? It is like a perfect circle.I buy assassins creed 2. I get an immediate road block. I have to install uplay, update it, update it again, update it again, and again, and again. I am not being funny about this. It updates for about a half an hour. And when I say this I mean Uplay updates - not the game - the launcher. For 30 minutes or so.While this is going on I have been reading about this uplay system and Assassins Creed 2. Disconnects you in the middle of the game, Check. Breaks your saves, check. Unable to be played in offline mode, check. Have to make an account on another system, check. According to what I heard and seen much of this is finally fixed. [probably not.] During this process I have immidiately decided that this game was a bad idea and that I do not like buying games from ubisoft. They, in the first few minutes after buying this game and getting it ""installed"", have convinced me that I should be looking for a crack of somesort FOR A GAME I OWN. That I should move on to piracy methods to play a game I own without a hassle. Finally it is done updating - Wonderful! Now to make my account. I enter my account info and press submit. Uplay - No network connection. I go back to the video of an adorable kittty cat playing a keyboard on youtube... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Again? Same. Long story slightly shorter, I end up going to their site and creating an account. Finally! After a bit more futzing I start the SINGLE PLAYER game in offline mode. Check my settings. Press play and....No network connection. Ok♥♥♥♥♥♥on it. I ended up having to start the game in online mode before it would play at all. After this it would lett me play in [sort of] off line mode. Ok Ubisoft. I bought the game. I GAVE YOU MONEY. Why are you abusing me with this? I could have pirated the game, still very easy to do - Infact I almost grabbed the cracks during this just so I would not have to suffer any longer. At my customer hourly rate this game would have cost over $200 US dollars just to get into working order. Please justify that cost to me. No - no never mind, you can't.The game is great fun, if you can suffer through the uplay process. My advise is - Don't buy ubisoft games. They have gone insane on this whole ""pplz is steelin our gamez!"" kick. And software pirates are not the ones that suffer in the end. The legit buyers do. "

												Second game created in the Assassin's Creed series. Pros:+Good storyline+New weapons+New characters+Variety of missions+Retains original Templars vs Assassin's WarCons:-Somewhat complicated mechanics (you can't air assassinate a person 2m away and high from you)-Way too much water in Venezia-You don't go out of the Animus a lotConclusion:This game is really fun if you enjoyed the previous Assassin's Creed game with Altair. Ezio is the Assassin for this era, and the fact he has more weapons (gun blade, poison blade, second hidden blade, smoke bombs, etc.) means there are more ways killing people.  Rated M because of perverted scenes that are censored.9/10			"

												This is a prinme example of an excelent game burned to waste with problems. Here is my time line with it:1. Oh look it is on sale!2. Buy 3. Install4. You must register on UPlay5. Register6. Update Uplay7. Another update8. Chrash9. Works10. Expirience crazy sound bugs and glitches11. Explore the web front to back for a solution to no avail.12. 3.2 GB update on an old game (WTF?!)13. Entire game is in Chinese14. Another update that fixed the chinese language problem15. Upon examination there are still glitches with the sound and seemengly nohing has changed in the game with that update except it is back in english.16. Some more research on the sound problem to no avail.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!! It is a waste of money. It is plagued with glitches and bugs (the most common one being the sound). The game itself it awesome. Graphics and story are stellar, gameplay also, voice acting I think it is good but I would not know because THE SOUND IS♥♥♥♥♥♥!!! I posted on Community Hub and discussion board and on Ubisoft also. No one knows how to make this thing go away.I am very dissapointed in Ubisoft and I will save my money on other developers. It is very unlikely that I will buy anything from them in the near future.			"

												After a few years from the first game, I came back to play through the second part of the series and was not disappointed. At first I was a little lost from the different playstyles; I spent a while trying to figure out what button it was to blend in with crowds, until I was eventually shown through the story (how to be a noob 101, here). I'm a huge fan of the story, and I have to say, the ending got me. Definitely worth it, after the initial struggles.Initially, getting the game to actually run was a problem. Steam didn't actually give me the Uplay launcher, per se, and because I did not know that I needed it, I was getting frustrated that I couldn't actually play the game that I had just bought. Looking through for answers, I was a bit annoyed that I had to go download a whole new launcher just to get the game to run, but I sucked it up and dealt with it, as I'm sure a number of other players have already done, and will continue to do. Aside from that initial issue, I didn't have a single problem with functionality or anything of the sort, so that's a plus. I've now set my scopes on part III, because I want to know how Desmond's story really ends (and don't want to do it the cheap way and search it on the internet—where's the fun in that?).			"

												Some game's age well, remaining entertaining and challenging long after release. ACII does not appear to be one of those games. The greatest challenges you'll face are not enemies or puzzles. No, the combat is laughably simple and the platform puzzles straightforward. Instead, the challenge will lie in the poor camera and loose controls. You will never die in combat, but you will die to jumping in a random direction many times. As for the story, it starts strong with good human interest and character growth, but quickly runs down the rabbit hole of JJ Abrams style mystery and conspiracy with no satisfying conclusion.The last 6 hours of gameplay I was gritting my teeth, forcing myself to finish this bloody game once and for all. It was not fun. It was repetitive and simple and frustrating. If you're debating whether to get back into the AC series after years away, I would strongly recommend against it. Read the wiki to catch up on the story and buy the latest sequel, if you absolutely must.			"

												I hated the first Assassin's Creed but decided to give this one a try when it was on sale. I still hate it. Boring, repetitive, uninspired, bad controls, crashes at least once every two hours, etc. On top of that, you have to install Ubisoft's awful game service, make an account, and put up with its slow and poorly-timed updates. You have to be dedicated to play this game. First, you have to sit through up to an hour of pointless install. Then, it takes a good hour or two of very, very boring intro until you finally get to the meat of the game. For example, some of your first ""exciting"" missions include: watching yourself be born, walking around some cubicles in a drab office building, carrying a crate around for your mommy while she talks with another grown-up, climbing flights of stairs, and talking to everyone in the room to make sure that their feelings are heard. I am absolutely not kidding. These are your missions.When you finally do get to assassinate people, the combat is so stupidly easy that it feels pointless. Yes you can fight with a sword, and the enemies will block, etc. But if you just switch to your hidden blade, pretty much every time you press the X button it instakills an enemy--no trouble at all. Once you get a double hidden blade, it instakills TWO enemies! It's not combat, it's just pressing a button. It was more difficult to pick up the crate for my mother the first time because the controls are bad. Killing people is much easier than picking things up.But the absolute worst thing about this game is the stupid, stupid storyline. Despite their disclaimer, the people who made this game are clearly very hostile toward religion. Instead of real historical data, the game is filled with misinformation and twisting of facts that are told to you as though they were facts. Even Wikipedia is a better source of historical information than this game--and I am talking about the times when the game purports to be telling you historical facts, not about its fanciful storyline about the Knights Templar. I understand that when the game is being creative it does not have to be historically accurate. As for its creative storyline though, it may sound clever but honestly it's just Gnosticism all over again. Reversing the Fall, making Adam and Eve's sin into a good thing, this has been done already nearly two millenia ago. Secret societies, conspiracies... honestly, don't we have enough of this everywhere else?Maybe I would like the game if it were just a bit more believable. For example, if the people in renaissance Italy actually spoke and acted like people in renaissance Italy and not just like horny, crude Americans today. A little research would have done the writers a lot of good. For example, they wouldn't say ""Sunday service,"" they would say ""Mass."" Women would not be allowed in the cloister of the monastery. Instead of saying ""priest"" for a parish priest they would say ""curate."" But honestly all of this is superfluous; first and foremost, if you murdered two men in renaissance Italy--or even modern America, for that matter--and then picked up their bloody corpses and dragged them out into the street, tossing them in front of a crowd of people, I don't think those people would simply glance at you and then continue going about their business. But this is exactly what they do in this game.Save yourself the frustration. Buy a better game, and avoid this over-hyped series altogether. They will continue to pump out worthless assassin games--three or so every two years--until the hype wears off.			"

												These games are all the same, so my recommendations will all be the same. The world we get to assassin in are quite nice and great at representing these ancient cityscapes. That said, the storyline is bad in every game, and the games try their best to make them as historically inacurate as possible. PC port is terrible - fair at best. Just don't buy them.			"
