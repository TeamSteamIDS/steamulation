												Prototype is what happens when you combine the urbanized open worldness of GTA4 with the plot of Crysis 2 (except the virus is a Left 4 Dead / Resident Evil-esque virus instead of aliens) with a protagonist that is essentially a cross between a biological human T-1000 and DC comic's Parasite (he consumes people to gain abilities, knowledge, skills, etc). The superpowered gameplay is definitely my favorite part, there are many ways to win the major story battles and sidemissions with the various moves at your command. As Alex Mercer, you can either pick up guns and rocket launchers or become a weapon yourself by shape shifting your body into claws, blades, bludgeons, whips and even a cannon ball move that launches you toward your target with enough force to blow up armored vehicles later in the game. Speaking of armored vehicles, you can hijack tanks and skyjack helicopter gunships (and this even looks exactly like that scene in T2 where the T-1000 gets on that chopper and tells the guy to get out LOL). When on foot and exploring Manhatten you use your augmented abilities to parkour the landscape, at full upgrades you can leap over 5 story buildings easily and glide / airdash through the air very similiarly to how mario from Super Mario World glides with the super cape. There is an element of Metal Gear Solid in this game too since you can shape shift into other people that you consume, ie soldiers or pedestrians in the street in order to blend in since the military is constantly looking for you. The story mode is pretty unique: your character wakes up having exactly the same knowledge the player does as to what is going on, and through a mechanic known as the web of intrigue you eventually come to understand the game's story and background on everything that is going on around you. As you explore Manhatten you will find people with the Web of Intrigue icon over their head indicating that they can be consumed by you to learn what they know in connection to everything that happened. This game features sidemissions that show up on the game's minimap that will showcase your skills with the various abilities you acquire and see how fast you can be parkouring from place to place and get bronze/silver/gold/platinum medals depending on your 1337ness.I started playing this and finished it in about a week, making sure to get every sidemission completed on platinum. Because the plot is advanced through Web of Intrigue it is possible to finish the game without getting every bit of story out of it so I did a new game+ to find the remaining consume targets to get the whole story. For the most part the main story missions are easy with some tricky boss fights that really make you use all of your abilities to some degree, the most challenging aspect of this game is definitely getting platinum in every sidemission (think classic NES game level challenging). Overall I give this game a solid recommendation for its fluid gameplay (I love the parkour!) :) "

												I like the concept of the anti-hero. You play as Alex Mercer, an infected, who unlike other infected people turned to a superhuman with extraordinary abilities. You can run, jump at high speed. I almost said you can also climb but that is not true as you simply run on the side of multi-storey buildings. Everything is easily accessible. You have the usual action-adventure free roaming concept here: beacons indicate the starting points of missions so once you approach them a cutscene continues the story and your mission begins. Other than that you go wherever you want and whenever you want. And where? In New York. There are recognisable landmarks and as you can guess the map is quite huge - in fact, certain parts are only accessible at a later stage in the story.There are many collectibles and you also gather experience points for everything you pick up. This enables you to purchase further upgrades and the stronger you get the more exciting each battle is. Upgrades usually mean a new method of transformation - your arms become tentacles and you can smash or slice everything up. Certain enemy types can only be defeated by certain melee methods so there's variety here and the game is challenging as requires your attention.The only issue with Prototype is the places where you are indoors. The ceiling is high up as they want you to be able to jump equally high as outdoors but due to the limited space in the rooms / halls fights are usually difficult in these places. Other than this Prototype is a very interesting, action-driven TPS game that delivers an excellent shape-shifting combat and your protagonist's agility makes free-roaming very exciting.			"

												Yet another gem in my Steam Library. In case you should have a god complex, this game is made for you - If you don't.. it still is! Basically you slip into the role of the more or less anti-hero Alex Mercer in the city of Manhattan that was infected by some kind of Virus and is now being controlled by Elite Soldiers called ""Blackwatch"". Once you hit the button ""Start new campaign"" you get thrown right into the Open World with just a few background infos concerning the upcoming story. All you know is that you are Alex Mercer, who has been shot down and fatally wounded and later on got infected by a virus that somehow revived you and gave you shapeshifting abilities and superpowers. Now he is trying everything he can to find out how all this happened, where it will be going, and how he could possibly end all this by ""interrogate"" the ones responsible. Making your way through the story you get sucked in by a good load of interesting twists, challenging bossfights and tons of upgrades for Alex that make him the toughest enemy ""Blackwatch"" will have to face during the whole infection. There are plenty of Sidequests to be done - some of them nice and some of them just to keep you busy finishing the game 100%. But if you focus on the Story Quests alone its possible to finish it within ~12 hours on a medium difficulty. It can be frustrating at times (not just because of the AI) but because of overpowered attacs or wrong set ""Mission Failure"" parts, but once you've beaten the game it feels really satisfying even without Steam Achievments or cool costume unlocks for Alex Mercer. The gameplay itself is (to me) almost flawless and the possibilities endless due to Alex' powers and the maybe best looking armor in 2009's video games. With this being said I'd like to leave you the decision if you should get this game on a sale for 5 bucks or just let it be, all I can do is just highly recommend it to everyone who loves a good classic and a game by 'Activision' that is not ""Fast and the Furious"" nor ""Call of Duty"" but actually a GOOD game.A point some people might find interesting- the graphics are not horribly bad but neither outstanding for 2009...something in between should describe it precisely. If graphics don't bother you its a perfect game for a casual afternoon when you are off work and just want to relax..in case you do love good graphics take a look at Prototype 2 ..it has all the features 1 has to offer and even more - will write a review to part 2 aswell once I finished it on Steam.*Note* I wasn't experiencing any performance problems on my nvidia card but I know that there are massive problems with all AMD cards... and they wont ever fix it I believe so in case you don't have a Nvidia graphics card you might want to play this one on a console. As always I hope that my review was helpful and written understandable and made it easier for you to decide to buy a game from 6 years ago that is still more foward than todays releases...			"

												Truly epic game, the free-roam mode is what makes it best, you really feel badass jumping skyscrapers and watching entire US Army trying to stop you and fail miserably. RPGish progress where you spent evolution points on power upgrades and new tricks is well done. Surprisingly the story is pretty good as well, and there is a decent plot twiss. The graphics were dated when this game was released now they are pretty crappy but that does not take the awesomeness of the game. Flaws? Well the graphic for one, bad side-missions, repetitive NPC models making you feel like in clone wars. Nothing major.The combat can get a bit repetitive if you don't mix things up. Great game.			"

												Prototype is one of the best games to release in 2009. Outside of the lackluster stealth and disguising mechanic, the brutal combat, huge open-world, varied challenges, and utterly satisfying gameplay makes this a must-have title for any serious gamer's collection. Although it’s beset by blandish graphics and wickedly uneven difficulty, Prototype delivers a fast-paced, relentlessly amoral and wonderfully brutal sandbox adventure in a detailed city filled with cool things to see and do.This open-world action game set in Manhattan is proof that even viral outbreaks can be incredibly fun if they're done right. A dark and brutal superhero-comic come alive. Prototype offers more than enough room for criticism due to its simple mission-design, unlovely graphics and boneheaded AI. Nevertheless it also copes with creating the intensive atmosphere of a city on the brink of disaster and of the player being the ultimate superhero, therefore resulting in a gameplay experience that is by far greater than the sum of its parts.If you’re a fan of superhero games or just love gratuitous violence, you can’t go wrong with Prototype.I wholeheartedly recommend it, with a small caution sign reserved for the little ones, because the game is violent on quite a large scale.

												Honestly, this is probably one of the best open world games made to date. Even though the graphics are slightly dated it doesn't detract from the experience at all. You play as Alex Mercer, a man who woke up in a morgue with little to no memory of who he is or what happened to him. The entire story isn't handed to you by playing through the main missions, in order to fully understand what's happening to you and New York, you will need to seek out certain key people marked as Web of Intrigue targets. Hunting these people down and consuming them will give you pieces of the story, this method of storytelling is pretty interesting and made me want to keep searching just to figure out what the hell happened. By consuming powerful enemies you add new powers and abilities to your arsenal. I don't think there are many other games that can make you feel like an unstoppable badass that leaves a trail of death and destruction wherever you go like Prototype does. Just to clarify, you won't be so overpowered that you'll never have a challenge. As you progress through the game, the military will adapt and start making things a bit more difficult for you. They have viral detectors that can see through your disguise, supersoldiers that can match your strength, and there are times when your cover is blown and you'll end up fighting multiple tanks and strike teams of apache helicopters, so it can get pretty hectic if you don't know what you're doing. However, if you manage your powers pretty well and know what situations to use them for, even if♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan and you're under attack from all directions you can still come out on top fairly easily. Especially with the use of devastator attacks that have a large area of effect and can quickly turn the tide in your favor.TL;DR version: You're a badass with a lot of powers and you can do a lot of cool stuff. Overall I give it a solid 9/10. I highly recommend you get it if you see it on sale.			"

												Prototype is a game that I mostly consider very underrated that has unfortunately been long forgotten by the press and players alike. It's a very good example of a game that comes across as very generic but subverts your expectations.You play as Alex Mercer, a man seemingly infected with a virus that allows him to shapeshift and consume people. He starts out having amnesia and for the first half of the game comes across as extremely edgy. The characters and dialogue are very hamfisted and the scenarios the game throws at you are ridiculous to the point of being absurd. However during the second half the writing starts to become more clever. The protagonist has a very noticeable character arc that I grew to like, and the general progression of the game from this seemingly pristine city to a demonic hellish Manhattan really gripped me a great deal. This weaved very nicely with the gameplay.Prototype isn't a game that aged very well, and was pretty antiquated even when it first game out. Realism is thrown completely out the window as you regularly fly across cityscapes, run into npcs and absorb them into your body, and grow giant swords out of your arms to destroy tanks. It also hasn't aged very well graphically. However the controls are very flowy and I greatly enjoyed exploring the world. I also enjoyed how the player's powers upgrade gradually as you consume more people and found it appealed to my very morbid sense of humor. It also features a neat New Game plus mode.Regardless, I recognize a lot of what I like Prototype for is very subjective. Objectively it's a very average game, and not one people are going to really remember 10 years from now. But it's still a game I like, and if you can find it for very cheap on sale you'll find a very charming sandbox game. Not the best but certainly not the worst.			"

												In Prototype, you're not a man, you are not a god, you're not even a person, you are ""The Prototype"" a Biological Experiment released on the American city New York. It's the year 2008 & life as the American population knows it is in chaos as a biological weapons experiment gets released on the population in an experimental test to see what happens to humans when they're consumed by the disease.You play as Alex Mercer a Lab Scientist who has become infected by the disease known as ""The Mercer Virus"" & you are hunted down because of how powerful you're becoming.Throughout the progress of the game you are encouraged to go out on your own & start experimenting with your powers by destroying ""Zombie Hives"" or by consuming the physical form of Blackwater Mercinaries who're out to hunt you down for your genetic DNA codes.While experimenting with your powers you're granted EP Points in which you can use these points to unlock new abilities & morph your body to become even more powerful, so it's always suggested to get out there and explore this wonderfully designed map & do all the various side missions & quests in order to rack up those points & upgrade your abilities.Prototype is a VERY well designed game by all means it's an excellent game for those who're big fans of Sandbox Style gameplay and for those who enjoy games such as: Crysis. Assassin's Creed. Grand Theft Auto.Prototype combines the feeling of these games and a few others in the form of making you feel like a super human. It's a pity that this game received such poor sales & the company had to cease it's production of Video Games.However i can definantly recommend this game with a solid: 8/10It has received such a great score from me because of some of these factors:I'm a huge fan of open ""Sandbox"" games, i love to explore & i love to not be told where to go & what to do while i play games. I also very much enjoy going about this game and unlocking more abilities by completing all the various side missions and seeing what kinds of chaos i can unleash on the enemies.Although this game is great, it does contain some very common bugs but they're not game breaking or bad in any way so i recommend you give this game a buy or at least a try.

												Still a great game, but it is basically unplayable on modern systemsHere's how to fix that:1) Deactivate all HID devices in the device manager to get stable FPS.This is a common problem with many old games. At first i was reluctant to trying out this fix in fear of screwing up external or internal devices. Now I've had them deactivated for months and haven't noticed any difference.2) Unlock the game's graphics setingsPrototype can only address graphics cards up to 2 GB properly. If you have more than that, your graphics settings will be automatically limited. To fix that, follow this link: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showpost.php?p=23539057&postcount=6As for the game itself: It may not be as long-term motivating as GTA, but while there is still something to do / explore / destroy, you're gonna have a lot of fun. Another plus is that the game's internal Vsync actually locks it to 60 fps instead of the usual 30, which makes for a smooth gameplay experience. If you like causing mayhem and don't mind the little bit clunky mouse / keyboard controls (you can use a controller though), then you should try this one out.			"

My small, sociopathic mind always dreamed of running around, shapeshifting, and casually dismembering people with my badass claws or sword arm or whipfist. It's the offspring of gore, action, openworld gameplay, and glitchy stealth that was greatly improved in the second game. I enjoy it.

Yet it can be rewarding to know the story.Controls can be clunky on the keyboard coz it's not fully optimized for pc however the keyboard controls are still good.All in All it's still a good game to have.Grab this game on SALE to have MAXIMUM FUN and LESS WALLET GOUGING!

												Really good game. Not as unknown as it was when I bought it because of its sequel, but still quite underrated. It has a decent story, despite it's about a failed experiment/mutated people/zombies.I really liked that, unlike the other games about that topic, you are an infected one, and not a survivor, but even the infected ones tryto kill you. Basically, you're a solitary overpowered mutant that everyone wants dead and doesn't remember who he is and has to consume targets that have memories about that to remember it.It has a quite good graphics ( considering it's a 2009 game) and a good gameplay.The only thing, it gets quite repetitive when all you have to do is to infiltrate in military bases, destroy zombie hives and machines that emit poisonous fog, but at the start and at the end the missions are more interesting.On easy it's reaaally easy, as you are an overpowered mutant capable of regenerating consumating people or infected ones, taking other people's appearence, running on walls , making your limbs become weapons, stealing tanks, ecc...After you have completed the main quest if you want you can play another time without having to unlock everything you unlocked during the first time.

Really good fun.I spent most of my time picking up a taxi and running down the street seeing if anyone needed a ride. Most people within close range died due to oncoming traffic. The oncoming traffic being me.All in all I would give this game a Cherry flavoured flamingo out of 10.			"

												Story's great, but the cutscenes are short and explicitly to the point. Also, the game can be very unforgiving at times, and the first playthrough can be a hassle even on the easiest difficulty.Overall graphics are okay, but it takes somewhat of a penalty because you could probably count the amount of different generic NPC models on two hands.However, what makes this game worth the 20 bucks is the sandboxing. Plug in some headphones and just parkour around Manhattan, consume an army man and help take down an infected hive, hunt for collectibles, go on a zombie killing spree, play fetch with living people, troll the military, invade a base stealthily or guns blazing, go postal with a rifle in a civilian zone, hijack a helicopter and shoot at tanks, hijack a tank and shoot at helicopters, whip out your claws and slice people in half, eat living things until your hunger is satisfied, or do various ""events"" around the city (races, gliding to a specific target, war events, and just flat out murder events). There's no shortage of fun to be had.This game is amazing for killing time AND blowing off steam. You can play it for 15 minutes at a time, or 5 hours at a time. It's the kind of game you can't really ever get tired of.My only real qualm with the game is that there's too many tanks and helicopters that spawn in. You have to be extremely careful about screwing around on foot, especially after you've beaten the story, because tanks will spawn wherever you are and even if they're far away on the minimap, they'll converge towards you and wipe out what little fun you thought you could have. And don't even think about taking on the tanks, because that'll just make more of them spawn, and a strike team is almost guaranteed to be called in as well (and another one, and another one, if your wanted level persists). Then if you want to hijack a tank, you'll get to enjoy it for maybe a minute before enough hostile tanks have chipped away your health. Likewise with a helicopter among other helicopters. Basically, vehicles take away the fun from the game and I wish there was some way to disable them, but unfortunately there isn't.			"

												Rating: 7/10Overview: Open World Action AdventureThe Good:+ Traversing the open world city is amazing, probably one of the best in any open world game. You can easily run up buildings, jump off to great heights and then glide very seamlessly. + Side activities are very fun ranging from running obstacle courses hitting checkpoints, killing a certain number of enemies using certain powers etc. Using helicopters/tanks to kill enemies. Every activity has a bronze, silver and gold medal depending on how well you complete it. + Gameplay mechanics work well, you are given several different powers/abilities to kill enemies, + Completing main mission, side activities reward you with experience to upgrade your character. The Average:+/- Bland graphics even for an open world game. Granted, the number of pedestrians, vehicles, enemies, explosions etc. on screen is very impressive so have bland graphics is easier to accept. +/- A decent story that is told both through cut-scenes and consuming enemies/people. After consuming a person, you are treated to a short video of their memory. A cool way to tell the story and mix it with the gameplay.  The game is all about getting you in the action as fast as possible so the story takes a back seat to everything else. +/- The main missions are fun and are somewhat varied but most of them feel like you are either killing tons of enemies or running around chasing somebody. The Bad:- A technical mess to put it mildly. Very limited resolution and a framerate that barely hits 40 fps regards of your specs. - Given the vast number of objects on screen at any given time the targeting system seems to target everything except for the one thing you want it to target. - Boss battles create a frustrating difficulty spikeConclusion:A very fun if not flawed game. If you feel like running around and killing things with crazy powers and watching a lot of things explode, then this may just scratch that itch.			"

												Plays a little like you're a bossfight from MGS. Don't bother watching the cutscenes, the story is nothing to write home about, but otherwise Prototype is a load of fun. Pick up a pedestrian, any pedestrian. Run to the top of a building. Throw your pedestrian as far as you can, see if you can land exactly where they do, before they do.Fans of the Hulk games on PS2 and XBOX will note that in terms of mechanics at least, this is a colossal rip-off. People who have an aversion to being giant and green will probably prefer Alex Mercer's agreeably-generic appearance. And if they don't, they can pick up an old lady and turn into her, then punch helicopters out of the sky.Slight caveat - last time I played this game from Steam, all the sounds were playing in comical fast-motion. So if you can get it to work, it's fun. Otherwise it's unintentional hilarity.			"

They can hide.But they cannot conceal themselves from the rage I have inside.They will all soon pay for what they’ve done.Tremble in fear and see the monster I’ve become.﻿This pretty much sums up Alex Mercer.

												Right, so after reading all of the reviews where they say this games buggy, borken and horribly ported over, I went ahead and bought it anyway. I played it on the Xbox 360, and loved almost every minute of it. This PC port isn't anymore buggy than the 360 version but it looks a bit better, with faster load times. Im running Windows 10, with a i3 from a couple years ago, with 12 DDR3 GB of Ram, and a EVGA GTX 760 SuperClocked (which I love) Honestly, I havent found all these game breaking bugs other people have, so im just gonna enjoy it for what it is.An absolutely hilarious romp in NYC, with incredible movement and the freedom to trash an entire city block. Just have fun and buy it on sale, its fun if your not whiny about ""realistic graphics"" or comparing it to Infamous (which was nearly perfect) "

												KILL KILL KILL KILL MAIM KILL BLOOD DESTROY EAT CONSUME DESTROY!*Ahem*That is what playing Prototype is, if you are mad, kill something, if you are sad, kill something.I originally played this on the PS3, because I'm also a console slob alongside a PC player.How does this game translate over in the dimension of the PC?Is it still playable?Does it hold up today having been out for so long?Well...This game makes a surprisingly smooth jump over to the realm of the PC, with very little in the line of new problems plauging the game... except it's new controls.This game requires you to have a controller in order for it to be even remotely worth trying to play, since the keyboard controls are mapped to function buttons and unless you want to go through the trouble of shutting those down just to play one game, buy a controller.This leads me to the topic of if it is still playable. Yes. Yes it is.This game hasn't really changed in its playability. I'm running it on a typical laptop with no issues to speak of hitting me.Does the game still hold up?Well.. This is where the game might not be favored by some people. Long ago, a game was released called the Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction. The game was made by Radical entertainment. The game had you running around a city killing and maiming anything that moved as the titular Hulk.I bring this up because Prototype borrows HEAVILY from that game, like word for word basically. Only now, instead of playing as an angry asparagus, you play as Hatred's main character with far better personality... though he still broods quite a bit. The game is hard, stealth isn't easy to pull off either so most fights devolve into slap fests between you and whatever you're fighting. The early game is awful as you have no power for much of it, but after a certain story event you become broken and overpowered. In other games this would be an issue but here, it's just fun. Ripping shreds through everything in sight, be it infected zombies or people that are just standing there is incredibly fun to this day, and the story missions manage to be engaging and entertaining as they have you face off against some pretty crazy enemies from time to time. This game holds up quite well.9/10			"

 BEST PARKOUR SIMULATOR 2009 No, honestly, it has great parkour moves!This game is what started my obsession with the computer and the video game industry. One of my first games, it did not fail to make me interested in it. I have finished this game twice since I first played it in 2010, but sadly I was a pirate. Tbh, I feel it's kinda pricey being at 20$[MUST BUY IN SALE] but it's worth the cash!It might look outdated but for its time, it's pretty awesome! Story is all over the place, whereas the gameplay is frigging fantastic. In its prime, the game proved that  Alex Mercer = Hulk. Maybe even better? You have amazing abilities!I love the little stealth options they put in the game. Or you could just f**k♥♥♥♥♥♥up and boy, do I mean F**K THINGS UP. There's a great fix for the resolution cap of this game, in the guides which I used. Finally, what else do you need instead of a badass hero and abilities like being able to f**king pull a helicopter to the ground with bare strength? Oh, also his jacket IS available on Amazon ;D10/10{P.S- use Ctrl button to make Alex walk, do that in a crowd and watch him push/slap people off like they're trash, lol at hearing them whining like a bi*ch, I pushed a police officer and became most wanted in 2 minutesORconsume a high ranked official, in disguise bully your noob juniors repeatedly while walking casually and pushing them off}			"

												Rather than adopting the typical structured format for my review, I'll instead just explain why I can't recommend this game. First off, this game has consolitis. Hard. Maximum resolution is 1280x800, it can't be run in a window without ""unexpected results,"" and it ended up crashing my computer while attempting to play it. Twice. I think I will end up getting it on console, but I just can't recommend it for Steam. Apparently Prototype 2 is a worse port, which completely blows my mind. Anyways, this port just isn't worth it. It's buggy, locked down to hell, and is actually more expensive than just getting it for the 360 or PS3 off of eBay.			"

												Prototype is a game that accepts the fact that Open World games are defined by their movement mechanics, that much I learned from parkouring through the streets and over cars, running along the sides of buildings and gliding from the tallest skyscrapers.The story and characters has a certain grey mentality to it that just appeals to me. You're not a hero. You might not be the big villain either but you're certainly not a good guy either.The gameplay, besides running around Manhattan, revolves around using various evolved weapons to kill enemy soldiers, tanks, helicopters and mutants of varying sizes. The weapons are defined enough to keep you entertained even if you will find a favorite rather quickly, for me it was the whipfist.Graphically the game is not impressive but the backdrop of a destroyed city where constant battles between the military and the mutants take combined with a decent view distance makes this acceptable.One of the best open world games I've played.

												A great free-roam game,  Able to jump buildings and completely obliterate the military. Having evolution points to spend on power upgrades and trying to combine them to a combo is what makes this game interesting. There are also checkpoints where you can go and do some mini-games. The game does get repetitive or rather boring when you keep doing the same thing which is getting chased by the military on the same town (If you provoke them). The story on the other hand is really something, we get to see Mercer being known as the victim through all this when in the end that is not entirely true. Won't go to details but i really got somewhat hooked to the story.Heard alot about the port on this game, and i have to say they are not unfixable. So i recommend to not take curator ""PC Port Info's"" review lightly. Although there are things wrong, it works great with my AMD Radeon 7970, The Audio can be fixed also by changing the Sample rate of your speakers to 48000 or 44100. Only thing is that you can't put it in windows mode. "

												On one hand, humans are trying to kill you because you're a mutant. On the other hand, mutants are trying to kill you because you're a human. So there is SO MUCH TO KILL YOU CAN EXPLODE.This is a great action-RPG. It has a cool skill system that really changes the way you fight and gives you new ways to kill whatever you see.The battles are epic - soldiers and policemen with their guns and rocket launchers, tanks and helicopters from every possible direction. In the same time, gargantuan mutant beasts are chasing you trying to beat the crap out of you. You can throw people and cars at other people and cars, you can take over tanks and helicopters, you can grab military guns, and of course you have an arsenal of your own mutant-weapons. All that in a sea of panicked civilians (that you can eat to regain health, of course). A complete chaos of blood and explosions.If you like action-RPGs, get this game!			"

												First of all, I have been absolutely addicted to this game. I even found myself drooling in the intro. If you've watched Fringe or the X-files, then you should love this game. I must admit, there were some minor silly parts in the game that made me wonder, but overall, the game is great if you're like me. I even had writer's block when I got the game, and now I'm right back to writing, and not doing my homework. I've been back to waking up early in the morning just to play this game and see what's next. The main character, Alex Mercer, is very unique in many ways, and I grew very attached to him. Very.I am very thankful that I got this game and not the sequel, Prototype 2, which as far as I've heard, is a piece of crap in many different ways. (Not to mention that our beloved Alex is the antagonist there. Oh man, I'm gonna lose it again...)(Sorry, I forgot this review was for the first game)Noice game. Really. It's not as stupid as I thought. *Cough* I can relate to it.Not to mention that Alex Mercer is a trustworthy role model when it comes to treating strangers on the street with kindness.

												Pros:Transformation and being able to play the game stealth or full on badass.Combat makes you feel like a god and shape the city around you in destruction.City slowly decays as you get deeper in the story as you watch infected areas start growing out into a giant mess. Beautifully chaotic. Lots of upgrades for your character and ability to choose any build path you want.Unique specific weapon transformations for different situations and enemies.FPS was good for me and had no problem running it on an above average gaming laptop.Cons:Game isn't very challenging and throughout the game you feel like you can't die. (At least on Normal mode. This isn't a bad thing, just different experience if you want a game that's fun and just want to kill stuff).PC port mouse movement controls feel wacky. I honestly like the movement of using a keyboard to move and the simplicity of using your left and right mouse buttons to do combos; however, the camera movement with mouse for this port is just noticeably bad. After a while you get a little used to the jerkiness of the camera movement, but it feels like it should have been done a lot better.Another thing to go along with this is the mouse movement for switching powers with the cycle select. I really don't like how this was done in the port. You basically have you push your mouse as if moving it across the entire screen just to switch powers using the cycle select and it still feels hard to aim fast accurately, affecting the gameplay for fast reaction gamers.Game can get a bit repetitive quite fast for some people. General Game Rating: 9/10PC Port: 7/10I would recommend getting this on console if you have one. I'm normally a PC gamer, but once I played this PC Port after playing it on console you really notice how bad the mouse movement with the camera controls and even general menu selection was done. Still an amazing game if you can get past those notes though and just want a fun super badass button masher to play.			"

Prototype is an openworld game. You are mutated into some kind of super immortal mutant. There is a nice story of how got mutated and what happens to you thoughout the game.Tha game mechanincs are fluid as it should be in this kind of free roaming game. Moving and running through buildings and crowd does not require much effort  cuz you are a super mutant. But combat has a lot of variety.The best thing about this game is you are a multifunctional mutant and have a hammerfist or a blade arm or tendrils or claws. the game utilises all of these mutant properties in combat. And this brings confusing key combinations. but once you get the general idea, combat becomes incredibly fun.There are tanks and helicopters to hijack and drive or fly. Many side activities and challenges to spend time and collectibles that completes the background of the story accross the map. Even after completing the game, you might wander around destroying military or infected buildings or just creating massive chaos for fun.Visuals are state of the art back in the day it was developed. The map of the game is big enough i guess. Not like Farcry or Tomb raider but big.I am having audio and resolution bugs but if you can solve these issues, this game is so fun and playable.			"

												Right. For those that don't know, this game is an action-You sort of play a-It's got sort of... RPG-Okay, I got this. Remember that Godzilla film that came out about 18 years ago? Godzilla shows up and attacks New York? Gets killed on the Brooklyn bridge? Everyone hated it but you loved it because you were 7 and you liked Dinosaurs?This game is basically that film, except Godzilla is 5' 11"", wears a boss ♥♥♥♥ing hoodie, and doesn't die like a ♥♥♥♥♥... Unless you're really♥♥♥♥♥♥at the game. And I mean REALLY♥♥♥♥♥♥ You're basically unstoppable.Did I mention the hoodie?			"

												The whole story and feel is edgelord and a bit tryhard, especially the protag, but if you don't mind that it's pretty fun. Even if you don't know what the hell is happening, you can hijack a tank and blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up for kicks. Lots of fun mechanics to mess with. 6/10Originally played this on PS3. Most of the characters are an undefined mess, which you could chalk up to Mercer's unique existence/mind or them mostly being cannon fodder and written to be distant/vague/unrelatable, but I think it may just be lazy writing. The focus of the story is the virus, how it came about, what it does, and is now doing. This mostly involves collecting memories conspiracy-theorist-style and smashing a ♥♥♥♥load of helicopters. The web of intrigue surrounding it is pretty interesting and sounds plausible (even if the biology is not), which is saying something given this is a game about a guy with crazy superpowers fighting viral creatures. Mercer himself is either eyeroll-worthy or hilarious depending on how you look at him, but you will see hints that the whole ""powers"" thing has made him a better person. If you get that far, you can reflect on why this is funny.The OST suffers from LAIR Syndrome, being kinda bland/samey and nothing stands out, which is a shame since it sounds like they had an orchestra helping them. The visuals are nothing to write home about and the game hasn't aged too well; if you're walking down the street and not focusing on taking something out, you may find the repetitive NPCs and questionable AI to be immersion-breaking. The color palettes start to blend after a while as does everything else. The real joy comes from actually playing the thing and using the powers you unlock. Sneaky sort? Got you covered. Like to be a tank? That's there, too. Ranged? Yeah, kinda. Wanna just slice♥♥♥♥♥♥up with a giant blade arm? There's a military complex, go nuts. Timed challenges? They're kinda crap, but they're also there. There's so many ways to just screw around and make things go smash and boom that even though it's kinda lacklustre, I still keep coming back. People like to compare [Prototype] to inFamous due to release dates and themes. This one is darker and more bland, but the powers are way more fun.The game opens with you in a scenario where you can wipe out city blocks of military personnel with ease and elbow-drop tanks, so if that sounds good to you, try it out.

												Totally, hands down, recommend this game. You're a killing mention, unstoppable, that's what the city of New York sees you as, but that isn't all. The character you play as, ""Alex Mercer"" has some secrets, those secrets were within his memory until he's been exposed to a virus, known as the Blacklight virus. Play through the game to discover what has happened to you; ""Alex Mercer"".The virus you've been exposed to has taken over your brain and body and is now ""you"". You can kill and ""consume"" any person you see, after killing and consuming you can shapeshift to the person you've last consumed. That includes civilians, military, and important military officers. When you shapeshift into them, you can ultimatly sneak through areas you ""Alex Mercer"" cannot. When you kill and consume the person of your choice, not only do you shapeshift into them, but you also get their memories, and skills. For example, if you kill and consume a helicopter poliot, you will gain the knowledge to operate a helicopter. Ultimatly this can be played as a sandbox game, this game never forces you to do objectives, you can always roam free in the city of New York. Quick thing to add, I have a 1920x1080 16:9 monitor, and this game doesn't seem to have that high of a resolution, so you'll have to search up a quick fix for that. "

												Imagine playing GTA or Saints' Row, except you're an infected, murderous shape-changer. This game puts you into a simulated city, controlling a character with strange abilities, and proceeds to turn you loose. You, Alex Mercer, are a science experience gone wrong, worthy of the Umbrella Corporation, and you will have to bust some heads to get to the bottom of it. The game is slightly dated, but provides a really unique and enjoyable experience, thanks to the active controls of your shape-changing powers, and a new perspective on the 'mutant infection' story.

												Prototype 1 is vastly superior to its sequel prototype 2. It has a few more powers, and abilities, and COMBOS. In prototype 2 it felt as though all your attacks were just spam the stab button, there weren't any differentiations of moves, only one chargable thing per power. Prototype 1 was harder (in a good way). When trying to comsume something, you could be interrupted by a missile/ mutant. Prototype 2, is a cakewalk. You had upgrades that made it too easy, like the one that makes all normal bullets bounce off, meaning the only way to get hurt, is from a missile or mutant, making all footsoldiers useless comsumables. You can't be interrupted when you consume something either, meaning health is stupidly easy to get back. Then there are the devastator attacks, spikes, tendrils, and a death wave of mass (there might be more, I haven't unlocked everything yet). In prototype 2, you have the tendrils, and the ability to call in mutants to fight for you that have the dummbest AI and don't attack what you want them to.Only thing prototype has better is the map size, It nearly trippled the size of the first.The first may look a bit worse compared to the second, but trust me, if you are debating over which to get (get the first).

												TL;DR (even though it's a quick review): Purchase this if you appreciate open world, fast-paced storylines with no restriction of smashing skulls and being properly badass, as Alex Mercer, the prototype.An intriguing storyline collates with a self-explanatory prototype human being resurrected into life, or exploration of death rather; with powers unheard of - to create a vast mess of gore and chaos.I didn't even take any notice of the graphics because I focused much on the storyline to genuinely optimize my knowledge of the graphics. The game is captivating enough to draw me away from sensing if the graphics are too minimal or too maximum. I ran mine on the lowest settings I could acquire as I have a simple HP laptop, and the game looks incredibly smooth.gr8 r8 4 dis m8 11/10 would play again[ Edit: I now have an actual computer and not the laptop mentioned in my review - I still play this game from time to time as it's just fun to go back to - the story is repeatable and the gameplay is fluid. ][ Second edit: I can still verify that this is true. I don't get addicted but I can play and relive the nostalgia as easy as clicking your fingers. ]			"

												This game is no masterpiece, but it sure as hell is fun. The game itself feels somewhat like a Grand Theaft Auto/Assassin's Creed clone since the protagonist, Alex Mercer, does a lot of hijacking, and stealth is involved in a lot of missions. However, it is still fun and takes a different approach by making the main character a shapeshifter with a motive that seems more anti-hero than heroic.Pros:-Fun mechanics-Awesome upgrades/powers (my personal favorite is the Claw power)-Has the unique ability to allow you to shapeshift into anyone-Decent story-Doesn't hold back on the gore-Some missions are challenging but not impossibleCons:-Missions can be repetitive-Voice acting is a bit stale-Graphics are dated (it's not unplayable but if your looking for graphics as good as The Witcher 3, Rise of the Tomb Raider, or recent GTA games, you may want to lower your expectations)-A lot of escort missions involving tanks... need I say more?-Achievements would have been a nice add since collecting the landmarks/hints and doing the challenges don't really feel satisfying enough (just a personal prefrence).All in all, this game has it's flaws but if you're having a rough day and want to kick back and beat the crap out of some zombie-like creatures, or if you just enjoy parkour and stealth games in general, this game is for you. I would just like to add that I recommend buying the game during a sale, as $20 is a lot to spend on this game. I bought it on sale for $4 and it was totally worth it.			"

												For me, a good sandbox game must have several things to be good:1) A variety of side missions to do in between story missions.2) Story missions that vary greatly from above mentioned side missions (lookin' at you, Ubisoft).3) A fun way to get around the city (web-slinging, parkour, good variety of vehicles).4) Plenty of upgrades that help you not just get around the city, but destroy enemies.Some of my favourite sandbox games are all these and more. The Batman: Arkham games, Infamous, Shadow of Mordor, Saints Row (especially IV).Prototype fills in my criteria very well. The story is largely forgettable, but the action is solid and the powers at your disposal are varied and fun as hell. I've actually re-played this multiple times: once on a friend's Xbox over a week, several times on PS3, and now on PC.I've heard some people have had technical difficulties and that it's not the best port. Speaking as someone who's played it on two different consoles, I can say I haven't run into any difficulties. Not yet, anyway.Is it the best game out there? No. Is it the best sandbox game out there? No. But it's a lot of fun and worth getting on a discount.			"

												Prototype is very addicting, as it uses a upgrading menu to keep you playing. This game is identical to Saints Row IV, only this was realised before hand. If you want a game where you can't stop playing, I recommend checking out Prototype. The story is ok, but the gameplay is very fun as it involves the use of abilities such as disguises and a wide variety of weapons for your character.			"

												A fantastic sand box where you can DIVE KICK helicopters and troll the military NPCs by subtly pushing large objects to obscure their vision and make them glitch hilariously (as with any joke military group).Hmmmm...where to start?  The Difficulty!It can range GREATLY across all pre-set difficulties.  Even on easy, enemies can bum rush you like no business and just bombard you with rockets, bullets and the explosives of the army kind.  Hunters can just wipe your health bar away if you don't act fast enough.  Even your standard army mook with a rocket launcher can be a pesky jerk, especially when there is more than one.  You gotta be on your toes or the bad guys will utterly destroy you.The lock-on system...bleh.  I dread it.  It's just...eugh.  The camera is just ruined everytime I lock on, and it doesn't help when so many people just zerg rush you to hell.  Gee, I want to turn the camera to better see the environment! OOPS!  It instead jerks around to the only other enemy and just disorients me.  Maybe it's just me...not being used to any sort of lock on, but I'd rather set the lock on to target the biggest threat or the mission objective (be it a foe) while keeping the camera semi loose so you can still keep situational awareness and don't get blasted to Timbucktoo.Of course Radical Entertainment is about as dead as every helicopter I've encountered.The Story...um...it's nothing to really to talk about.  Other than some of the missions being BRUTALLY hard, even bordering on unfair, and with the final boss being a good stomp to the nuts.  The vehicles kinda feel like a joke or just some plain therapy.  In combat their about as flimsy as a deck of cards, but just for roaming around, running over random cars, it's pretty neat.  Helicopters are just...no.I've only encountered one crash so far, and that's after almost 6-12 hours of play.  The game's graphics are...OK for it's time, it's (probably) just a cut above Goat Simulator.  The max resolution is quite limited, and the amount of options there are for fine tuning your performance...well...it's nothing to talk about.  Just like this game's story.Regardless...this game is a gem in the rough.  If you just want to beatdown enemies so strongly that they just gib, collect goodies that are scattered all around NYC, and do little side missions, don't be afraid to take a second look at this.

												Even if it's been 8 years since this game released, I cannot deny that it's a great game to play, it's a lotta fun, it's the kind of open-world game I love to play because of how much freedom has been given, much like Crackdown (which is sadly not available for the PC). And I've already played the game before. And everything seems to be the same with the game, save for a few things ... Gameplay:It's a third-person action-adventure open-world game, taking place in a quarantined NY, in which you take up the role of Alex Mercer, a man who woke up in a morgue only to find out he's got superpowers (although it's the nasty-yet-cool kind). You have total freedom to do what you want - sprint around endlessly, jump over buildings, scale them, kill and consume the good guys and the bad guys, disguise as them... it's very similar to Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction and Crackdown in terms of gameplay. But neither of them have the raw violence in it as this game does, which is what enhances the fun factor of playing it. You also have sprint trials, endurance rounds, and collectible tokens scattered around the city, so there's a lot of replayability to it. And some will definitely fall in love with the very open-ness of the world, so you will come back to it again and again just to have fun running and flying around with sick parkour skills, or slicing your way through a crowded area (personally, I racked up hours and hours mindlessly killing NPCs in the non-Steam version). Story:This is one of the greatest parts of the game. It's the story filled with deception, revenge, and a whole lotta searching. You play as an amnesiac superhuman who woke up in a morgue, and is now on the run to find out who he was. The story is the only fascinating part of the game, because if you can see through the glitches, and bugs, and the ugliness of the graphics, you'll find yourself playing one of the coolest, even if it's not one of the greatest, stories made for a game. It's a very grim, and a very dark tale, so don't expect jokes, or funny scenes. There's not a single one present in the game. Only buy the game if you can take the completely dark tone. Mechanics:The designs of the game are very straightforward. Go to A to do this. Go from A to B. Protect A. Reach B until time runs out. So, there's not much you can expect from [Prototype] when it comes to originality. Like Apple. The stealth mechanics were a joke. It's too easy to work around it, and even if it wasn't, the AI is dumb as hell, and very unreal. It's bad to the point that you might as well fight your way through, because sneaking around feels like things are being dragged. What do I like about it is what you can do with some of your abilities, for example, if you were disguised as a high-ranking officer, accusing fellow soldiers of being the enemy was really fun to watch. But again, that's an ability that was flawed, because of how overused it can get. And considering the AI, you'll never be ""caught"". Funny thing I noticed about the game is that the civilian population exists mostly on the footpath, like they were an abundant pack of wolves. I seldom see one of them cross the road, or even be on the road. The programming really sucks. So, in short, the core mechanics of the game were pretty half-arsed.Plays well with a K&M, too. I tried it with an X360 controller before, the experience wasn't as great as I expected, due to weird button layouts (as I play third-person games constantly with a controller, although with the PS controller). Visuals:Maybe, back in its day, it looked nice ... wait, no, I take that back. There are many games released back in '09 that looked better than this. The visuals are literally boring to look at. You'd wanna take a deep breath and wish for something better than yellow taxis, grey buildings, and crimson enemies. It's like eating a smoked chicken breast with absolutely no salt or pepper - Bland as hell. And the models look like they were made with clay. It was horrible to look at Mercer's mushy, gooey face. The ugliness is very visible when you see his jacket up close. It's like it was made out of stone or something. Regardless, the final product was visually less than mediocre, considering how this game is of Activision blood (but that's what we kinda expect from them now, friggin' Call of Duty butt-kissers).Steam Version Problems:First time I tried to boot the game up, an error occured saying ""Prototype failed to start (error code 53)"". This ticked me off. But, I googled the problem, and all I had to do was delete the recently created appmanifest.dll file (not all, the one created at the time of the game's installation completion), and then relaunch the game. Then, I had problems with the resolution not being detected, and so I used a link to fix the resolution problem. For those who have the game, and are looking for a solution, here's your time saver: Prototype Resolution Fix (It's a Steam link, so no worries).I've also had problems with the non-Steam version of the game before, when it suddenly crashes, or if it suddenly stopped working. I have not had those problems with the Steam version yet, but I am definitely paying very close attention to it. I would expect a game like this to have problems running. So, if you find yourself buying this game, do not keep your fingers crossed - it's a matter of time when you will have a problem with it. I have trouble exiting the game at times, so when I do quit, it's a black screen, and everything freezes. It froze like three times, prompting manual rebooting that many times. And I seldom do that. Reboot bad. Very bad.  Verdict:I really wish Steam implemented a ""50-50"" button like most people would say. But, if you are willing to work around the problems stated above or the problems that may or may not occur, then the game is a must-buy, but only during sale. Since I did work around these problems, and I am currently having fun as I overlook the bugs in it, and just enjoy what I used to with the non-Steam version, I'm giving this game a thumbs up.Just be aware of the fact that you're buying a game that's been released almost a decade ago. Their company is now a subsidiary developer, no updates, no glitch reporting, every problem must be dealt with yourself.			"

												The controls can be tricky to learn and master, but the story is really interesting, and the gameplay is lots of fun with a variety of choices in how you go about combat. There are plenty of upgrades and side-missions/achievements in-game to keep you occupied and rack up that experience when you find youself struggling. Visually, it's... not the reason you're playing the game.			"

												I recomend this game. First, the combat; true the combat could be better, it would be nice if there was a more stratiegic way to dive into the combat, but it makes up for the lack of difficulty with a lot of heart-pounding, edge of the seat action. The combat animation in this game is beautifuly gory, and well animated, and brutal and it makes you feel like a walking weapon. However, an open world is only as good as the way you travel through it, and when you move through this game you feel like a SUPER HERO. A mix of parkour and power-based traversal it is so, so satisfying. As is the open world, a sandbox is only as good as the contents of the world. The map is filled with these little side missions that are a good distraction for about a minute, but going on a masacre and slaughtering the militery makes up for that. As far as the story goes, it's...okay. Now I'm only about two hours into the game, and there are some aspects of the story that I love, however the game makes me hate those. I want to unravle the mystery surrounding the main character's past, but there's this infection spreading through out the city, I'm just gonna go deal with this and...oh wait, no I'm not. That aside I do LOVE this game and I can definety reccomend it for $20.00. I'd say it gets an 8/10 - a great game.			"

												Running up the side of a building and catapulting yourself over roofstops and between structures while gunships and hunters chase you down.. Dropping from the top of a skyscraper and leaving an impact crater as you strike the enemies below... Jamming your blade arm repeatedly into the face of a soldier, then slicing him in half... Taking a gunship out with a car.... hijacking a gunship mid-flight or on the ground disguised as a soldier, then turning on his friends... spinning in circles wielding blades, slashing hordes of infected...  leaping in the air and unleashing a tentacular harrage, killing everything.... jamming your claw into the ground and sprouting thick tentacles beneath a tank....

												What may seem like your average game is in fact a New York City simulator from 2009.As any New Yorker would, you can:- Chase taxis- Elbow black people- Dismemeber minorities- Get shot at by law enforcement- Fall out of tall buildings- Get run over by tanks- Get minimum wage slave labour in clearing bright red boils off of buildings for the military- Get shot at as thanks for saving lives- Run across a shrunken central park- Flee from flying things- Vandalise water towers- Beat back mindless, diseased hordes in times square- Sniff out tourists to devour- Catch leprosy- Forget that Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx existAnd this only scrapes the surface! This game finally fills the gap in the need for a good game that simulates daily life in New York City. I'm glad the American goverment shows the world how it deals with Swine Flu			"

												This is an early impressio of the game, I've unfinished my first playthrough.-This is now a review based on a finished playthrough on Normal.For other notes, I'll list my system specs below.Pros:-The game runs great! (on my system)-For seven years old, this game has aged great-Keyboard/mouse and controller functions smooth-Straightforward upgrade system-Fast paced gameplay-Promotes diversity of powers, can be a real challenge-MurderfestCons:-In spite of smooth controls, there are times when movement can feel a little clunky-Resolution issues with vanilla game-Difficulty curve hops around early on-The AI spawn system can get almost to frantic at times, creating almost unreasonably challening missions-Story is pretty bland and exposition is mediocre at best-Resolution for modern monitors is pretty limited unless the game is modified or files are editedOn the whole, Prototype is a solid game with plenty of great and fairly well executed ideas. Though at times it's age stands out a bit in terms of some clunky combat; but is more than made up for in some fairly memorable experiences. The games bosses do what a game boss should do, test what you've learned so far in the game and forces you to explore available powers. Battles are intense and the overall sinking feeling of insanity as Manhatten island slowly turns into an outright murderfest.Oh and the game runs great on my system which is running the Windows 10 os.I've give it a solid 7/10.System specs:MS-7850Intel Core i5-4670k @ 3.4GHz (4 CPUs) overclocked @ 4.3GHz12288 MB RAM (12 GB RAM)EVGA Nvidia GeForce 960 4GB RAM ftw editionModded game to run at native resolution of 1600x900			"

												This game isn't for people who like A LOT of blood.  There is no possible way to make a blood less playthrough.  With that out of the way, this game is bloody fun.  Open world slaughter with a decent story.  This is like the ultimate super hero game is super heroes killed everyone and just self centred.  The powers in this game is awesome, a sword and tons of other weapons at your disposale to kill and do anything in this world.  Yes this game is really cool, but there are a few bad things.  It's too easy, it takes one hit to kill almost every single person, the only ones that can take 5-10 hits are the infected, but even then they are a bit too easy.  You will die once in awhile if you decide to attract too many soldiers at once you will get surronded and get shot.  Also sometimes when running if there is a bit of a dip, then you won't be able to climb the building unless you jump.  BUT overall this game is amazing,  I can't wait to buy the second game in this series.  I would rate this game a 8.5/10			"

												I'm mildly upset; I've owned a copy of this wonderful game on a console before, and it was just fine. Great, even, I've had a fantastic experience. It has pretty good gameplay, not much in the way of story, but enough fun to leave a nice impression on you. The reason I'm leaving a negative review is because the PC port is horribly broken right off the bat. It's the sound. The god-awful sound.  it feels like it's been revved up to x64 speed. Do yourself a favor and don't buy the port.			"

												This game... cures angry thoughts... by releasing them. :3First time I played this game, I completed half of the main story stabbing, slashing and smashing sh*t in one night.You play as Alex Mercer, a powerful shapeshifter who was infected with a virus that grant him the use of INSANE powers and abilities in order to fight off those who are not and those who are like him. He gains new abilities thoughout the game and upgrades to enhance survivability and damage in order to survive the post-apocolyptic New York City. While running around, you also have the opportunity to complete events to earn extra EP to spend on powers and upgrades. Also, comsuming specific people will unlock memories that sums up on what the hell is going on to the world around you.-The story has its twist and turn moments that'll leave you at the edge of your seat. -In order to love this game, you HAVE to love the protagonist! -Controls are alright, as you are forced to mash every button to use an ability successfully. >.>-Characters have their intense moments as some are worth betrayal and some worth supporting Alex Mercer.-Gameplay and environment brings out the intense destruction of the situation you're witnessing.  Anyone who favors open-world, hack-n-slash, sadistic destruction, anti-hero with a badass jacket: this is your game!10/10 ABSOLUTELY recommended!			"

												Yet another underrated game. I’m starting to wonder how the major reviewers make their reviews: it seems that most games to receive good reviews are sequels to existing AAA titles, specifically shooters or RTS games. Anyway – back to the recommendation. Prototype is basically what you would get by mixing GTA3 and Spiderman, with a lot more superpowers, with an original but forgettable government-zombie-virus plot. The gameplay is fluid-smooth and the camera is /usually/ pretty good (especially using an XBox 360 controller). Both gameplay and story have a very good pace, and the difficulty is spot-on, where it ramps up but is rarely too easy and uncommonly frustrating. The only issue I had with the game was the repetition in side-missions and a /few/ usless powers; otherwise this is one of my favorite games this year.			"

												I liked Prototype but it is aging and I hope the sequel fleshes things out further. For once the storytelling makes up for the problems with the story; I had fun and looked forward to seeing the events happening.  The game has great mechanics. Alex truly feels powerful which reduces the army to mere hurdles to overcome. I loved the variety of powers and their destructive finesse. Unfortunately the missions boil down to the same things over and over and I would have liked to see more variety in this sandbox New York like what was available in GTA4. The visuals are good, but nowhere near the levels of GTA4 and Just Cause 2; -if that level was matched this would have been tremendous.  The gore and visuals really sell the creepy tone.The item collection gets boring since you only stumble upon them... no hunting possible. Recharging your health in the giant fights at the end is annoying, but early in the game is so easy there's not too much challenge.$20 or under is appropriate.			"

												Great game that I've finished at least 2 times outside of Steam.The gameplay is pretty nice, the enemies are nice to fight against.The map is small but fun to play (some locations are real nice like the building in progress, infected and the blackwatch (militaries).The story is awesome but uncompleted, there could be more (even with Prototype 2 It is not enough), the game is pretty much about conspiracy which is pretty fun.The game is really awesome but there should be more, a lot more.If you like open world and action games you will love this one, you'll love Prototype if you like games like Saints Row: Gat Out of Hell, The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction, Just Cause 2 but instead of using just guns you'll be mostly using your shape-shifting abilities which are truly awesome even If i wish there would be more sort of infects and maybe a bigger map or 2 maps (or more) in total.8.5/10It's all about destruction and chaos.The port isn't so good though but at least it's a good game and it's playable, there are fixes for almost everything.

												it's a super villian sand box game (shut up, he's totaly a bad guy)your options are, generally, kill every body, or kill every body then eat them, and the plot is >.> well it's pretty ♥♥♥♥ed, so much so theres a whole sub quest devoted to eating the people that know what the hell is going on.but shoving the mess of a plot aside, its pure genocidal fun. there are LOADS of fun ways to kill people from just grabbing them to verious shap objects to tanks and helicoptors, even the stealth missions, which are mostly side quests, are fun (and involve killing a AT LEAST one person) case you haven't noticed, killing people is pretty much the whole point, and if you need a game for that this would be it, if you want a plot you can understand and a touch more in objectives then 'kill everybody' well not for you then.also, the last boss can ♥♥♥♥ him self for being boring as hell			"

												Realy fun game, if you like open world combined with beat em up, this is the game for you. It isnt GTA-Like though, all you cant buy stuff or anything.... if id have to compare it to games, i would say Infamous on PS3 is very similar...  Story isnt realy big unless you do all the assimilation thing. Yeah so i feel its worth giving it a try, on my side, i liked it a lot but PC controls arent so good (read under) ""Cons"" - Mouse and Keyboard controls are♥♥♥♥♥♥ they lag for some reason (and im using good material, W8, I7 core, 12GB ram, 1To Disc Space, Good graphic card. Gaming mouse and  Gaming Keyboard + Headset.), they wont stop you from playing but will hinder your experiance a bit. I then  decided to use a Gamepad, it worked realy well and felt like the console version. You can either use an Xbox 360 controler, or use Motioninjoy's DS3 Tool (which i was using) to emulate a 360 controler with your PS3 controler, you probably could use a logitec controler or something like that but im not sure.

												I like the concept of the anti-hero. You play as Alex Mercer, an infected, who unlike other infected people turned to a superhuman with extraordinary abilities. You can run, jump at high speed. I almost said you can also climb but that is not true as you simply run on the side of multi-storey buildings. Everything is easily accessible. You have the usual action-adventure free roaming concept here: beacons indicate the starting points of missions so once you approach them a cutscene continues the story and your mission begins. Other than that you go wherever you want and whenever you want. And where? In New York. There are recognisable landmarks and as you can guess the map is quite huge - in fact, certain parts are only accessible at a later stage in the story.There are many collectibles and you also gather experience points for everything you pick up. This enables you to purchase further upgrades and the stronger you get the more exciting each battle is. Upgrades usually mean a new method of transformation - your arms become tentacles and you can smash or slice everything up. Certain enemy types can only be defeated by certain melee methods so there's variety here and the game is challenging as requires your attention.The only issue with Prototype is the places where you are indoors. The ceiling is high up as they want you to be able to jump equally high as outdoors but due to the limited space in the rooms / halls fights are usually difficult in these places. Other than this Prototype is a very interesting, action-driven TPS game that delivers an excellent shape-shifting combat and your protagonist's agility makes free-roaming very exciting.			"

(well graphics are really cool on cutscenes but in free roaming it doesn't..srsly it doesn't sucked that much so don't take it the wrong way )P.S: Buy Prototype 2 after you've done everything (everything : upgrades, events, missions)			"

												I really enjoyed this game, the chaos, transfermations and storyline were great aspects of this game. If I had to rate it; pretending that I was writing this when it first came out I would easily give it an 8.5/10. The reasons it didn't deserve a 9 or 10 is simply because of the bad pc ports of which I was getting 55fps with a gtx 760 and an i7 4790 another reason is because of it's outdated graphics even for 2009, this doesn't bother me that much but for some it might and finally it begins to become repetitive after playing for over an hour. Over all I really enjoyed this game and it had a lot to offer and I strongly recommend it.			"

												Great game. There's so much to do, so much to collect, so much to... kill. I do wish it had more detailed graphics but I guess it only makes sense since there are literally hundreds of characters on screen sometimes. It plays great with a controller. Consuming enemies just feels so right. I love taking over choppers, running on rooftops, taking over military headquarters. There are no limits. The bossfights are pretty epic, sometimes even hard. Also, there are tons of moves. So many that I don't think a lot of people will even try them all out, or even unlock them. It's a great first game and I can't wait for the second one. But I do hope they'll improve the graphics. And I hope they leave the consume ability fully intact (sounds and the way you have to pull it off). Fun fun fun ![Rating: 88/100]			"

												well this game is combo between platformer and extreme action style , the story was sort of weak and predicted , graphics are not bad not good , gameplay is smooth no glitches or complications , it has plenty of side missions  besides the main story , this game could've been better if they spent more effort on the story but in overal its an ok game 6.5/10 ( not worth the full price , buy it during discounts only )			"

												Until now,Prototype is still my favorite video game.When I was 11.I played this game at my friend's home.I think it's interesting.A man with awesome virus weapons:Knive, claws, hammers, whip, fists.Running around the city,killing zombies,climbing walls.When I got home,I can't wait to play it.So I downloaded form Internet.Then..I loved this game,I loved Alex Mercer,a virus,a bad guy.So I bought the game in Steam.This game, is my childhood,is my memories.My name is Alex Mercer.I am the reason for all of these.They call me a killer a monster a terrorist,I'm all of these things.Few weeks ago someone released a lethal virus in the Pennsy station.I woke up in the morguenow I hunt I kill I consume I become..

												Immersive should be the word to best describe Prototype. This game is different because it allows you to morph into a killing machince (A government experiment gone wrong). There's so many killing moves it's ridiculous. You skill up your abilities as you gain xp. You are a super mutant, so basically you can jump super high, fly, destroy tanks and attack choppers. The story is okay, but trust there's a lot to do and see. On bright side as well....there's zombies and monsters. The brutal blows you deliver in this game is mind blowing. You have to add this game to your library. I had to buy it 3x already. Yes, I like it that much. Yes, I'm a knucklehead. Prototype ♥♥♥♥♥, holla! 9/10			"

												The game goes out of its way to give a bad first impression --if your graphics card is half decent/recent, the game will get confused and think you can only do ridiculously low resolutions. So you fix that by installing some stuff.Next, the sound is ridiculously quiet. So you fix that by installing some stuff.Then, the game drops you into a scene with no background or context, which is bad in itself, and the visuals are really pathetic at that point (I think it's because there are many yellow cabs in that scene, and cars are the single most♥♥♥♥♥♥♥looking things in the game) -- which is misleading, as all in all, the graphics aren't great, but serviceable and quite acceptable for a game of that vintage. Oh yeah, and you can't pick your character, so you're stuck with one who looks like a dork (all of the time) and acts like an♥♥♥♥♥(half of the time).So, the first big challenge then is to make it past the first 30 minutes. After that, it's good fun for a good while. An open world and Awesome Powers(TM) go a long way, and the game is good fun for a good while. Eventually though, the missions get a bit repetitive, and starting about 2/3 into the game, it's usually not the missions that are the problem -- getting to the mission is (travel basically implied the choice of not using powers, in which case you'd get swarmed by zombies, ragdolled by soldiers using rockets and artillery on the zombies, and it would generally take forever, or you'd use your movement powers to speed things up, in which case you'd probably get detected, and take just as long trying to shake off those pesky strike teams. It sounds like a good, ""realistic"" idea in theory, but in practice, it was nothing more than a nuisance).That said, it's not a bad game if you can get it really cheap, but one that overstayed its welcome a bit and would have benefitted from having 1/4 - 1/3 of its playtime cut. (Or, as the more expensive option, have that additional playtime be made more varied and interesting -- something that largely succeeded in Prototype 2.)Pet peeve: The protogonist doesn't have that many voiced lines; he (as well as his sister) has a unisex name, depending on whom you consume you may run around as a woman anyway, and pretty much everybody else calls him ""it"" anyway (on the grounds that he's an evil infected commie mutant), so their dialogue wouldn't even change. At that point, they might as well have vastly improved the game by giving you a choice of character, at the cost of adding character creation, and a few dozen voiced lines for the protogonist (much more easily so than in P2, for a start, which has more story, and more dialogue -- even so, Saints Row IV, which rips off Prototype mightily, runs circles around both installments in that regard, just like SR3 ran circles around GTA).SO, DO I NEED TO PLAY THIS FIRST IF I WANT TO PLAY [PROTOTYPE2]?You know, I can't say with certainty. While P1 is summarized at the beginning of P2 (incompletely, and colored by the agenda of those doing the summary), you'll need P1 for the full story -- while P2 has a new protoganist, it continues the same story in the same setting, and certain key characters of P1 return. As P1 feels like it has a simpler, slightly less engaging story than P2, with less ""story per hour"", it's hard to say whether it'll be worth it when you really just want to play P2 and are only playing P1 for the additional background. That said, if the P1/P2 package deal is cheap once again (making P1 £2 or so) and you actually have the time for both, give it a shot -- if you really hate P1 two hours in, you can still fast forward to P2.THEREFORE,Qualified recommendation for the B- list P1 (decide whether you can stomach the somewhat retro look), recommendation for the A list P2 (whose only faults are that you have no choice of protagonist, and that it plays a somewhat cliched evil-corporations-and-uncaring-government plot straight, if rather better than P1 did).

												In this game, you play as a complete monster who spends his days killing countless people and/or stealing their memories by eating them. Yes you read that right. You are a psycho in this game and you have a big open world to play around in. So the story is a bit meh, filled with government conspiracy cliche mixed with evil science experiments, but it's not bad enough to ruin the game. And it is made up for by a stellar combat system and plenty to do in the game. Besides... sometimes it's fun to just cut loose and play a bad guy with unnatural powers.WARNING: This game is also buggy. A particularly nasty bug I ran into was  that everytime I started the game, then tried to load a save, the game crashed. My workaround was the start the game, start an all new game, and THEN to load my save file. Figured I should put that here in case someone buys this game based off this posting only to run into this particular bug.But if you don't have such troubles or can get around them, have fun!

												A fun and challenging game, if you can look past some mildly annoying to very irritating deficits.First, there's the story. It isn't terribly innovative, and it greatly depends on whether the subject matter is your thing. The narrative pretty much consists of the elements ""military blackops dealings"", ""bio-weapon research"" and ""ugly mutants by way of doomsday virus"". I happen to LOVE these tropes. Aside from this, the narrative suffers from a fractured nature and sacrifices character development for spectacle. The latter is to be expected, but Prototype takes it to extremes. Don't expect anything more than cutout labels like ""sister"", ""ex-girlfriend"" or ""ruthless military leader"". Regarding the ""fractured"" characteristic, there seems to be a strange divide between story cutscenes and gameplay missions, which I can't really explain except for diagnosing a distinct lack of flow. Now, this all may sound pretty negative, but what Prototype does, it does well. The scenario of New York going to pots and turning into a warzone is beautifully realized. The story is also more grounded in reality than, say, Resident Evil, which deals with similar themes. There is also a nice optional gameplay aspect called ""Web Of Intrigue"", which is for everyone who wants to delve deeper into the world of Prototype. By assimilating certain individuals, you unlock small story snippets connected by a network representing the individuals and their relationships. While this is really cool, there is also potential for future improvement. Why not, for instance, sort these cutscenes by theme and, once you have collected all scenes for a theme, unlock an option to watch a small movie combining the footage into one coherent story?Gameplay-wise, the game is a very fun power fantasy and, at times, exhibits a great flow. Parkouring through New York is exhiliarating, and once you experienced escaping from your exploding helicopter just to hijack the attacking chopper in mid-air, you'll know how great the gamplay can be. HOWEVER, there are two things that made it difficult for me to throroughly enjoy Prototype. The first one are the so-called ""Events"", which are nothing more than challenges spread over the city. I don't like challenges (or challenge maps, for that matter), as I think they are lazy design choices disconnected from any immersion and only present to shoehorn more content into a game. You like them? Well, great, you can scratch this caveat! Unfortunately, my second gripe transcends individual preferences. This big fun-killer is the atrocious lock-on system (INFO: I played this game with a XBox 360 for Windows Gamepad). There simply doesn't seem to be any logic or prioritizing behind it. It does not really work. Actually, it has no right to do so, as you frequently deal with dozens of enemies simultaneously. But the problem is that the gameplay depends on it. Most of the time, it's just mildly annoying as you have enough time and leisure to rectify any mis-selection. However, during the final act of the game, missions require you to constantly be on your toes and perform difficult tasks under time pressure. You are chasing over the rooftops of Manhattan in desperate pursuit of a chopper you have to stop before it leaves the area? Well, the lock-on doesn't care and prefers to select a tank roaming the streets twenty meters below you. You really, REALLY need to keep track of a powerful boss rampaging through the area so it cannot charge at you like a Chihuahua on meth? The lock-on decides that a common soldier strolling around somewhere requires your immediate attention much more. I can't remember when the controls of a game have infuriated me so much. It renders you and makes you feel helpless.Yet, I recommend Prototype. It features a competently realized and atmospheric scenario, and the gameplay makes even menial work fun. Menial work such as the Events, which can even be circumvented by grinding. However, you should be prepared to get frustrated in the later sections of the game.			"

It's like they couldn't be bothered when it came to the PC, as it seems just about everything is linked to the E button (when there are so many other keys...). I'm trying to do my stun attack when instead, my character is trying to get into a tank (this happened 2-3 times in a row before I just decided to change attacks). Also, I'll often run up walls when I'm trying not to, pick up the wrong objects in the middle of a fight, target the wrong enemy... feels like it's a console game lazily ported to PC.

												WARNING - HEAVY SPOILERS AHEADSo, I've just finished playing Prototype and I'm going to give my review of it.You play as a bloke called Alex Mercer, well, a shapeshifting sentient virus that took the form of one of it's first infectees and the person who released it, the sociopathic scienctist Alex Mercer. The game is fun, the graphics are good but some of the boss fights (Elizabeth Greene I'm looking at you.) are extremely hard if you don't use certain combinatons of abilities or stratedgies against them, the AI can be somewhat dumb at times but it's just fun to run around New York as a super-powered ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who dresses in an edgy black jacket and an untucked shirt with a high collar, like some demented hipster who can make his arms into blades among other things.Overall the game is rather fun to have a♥♥♥♥♥♥around in with the wide arsenal of abilities you have, ranging from being able to run up the side of buildings, automatically vault over cars, use people as skateboards or just go to town on the corrupted military disguised as an old woman after absorbing all her aged memories by eating her. The story's a bit bland and the protagonist is your average brooding white guy who doesn't seem to be able to grasp the concept of expressing the emotion in some other way than shouting someone's name or making snarky comments but that's besides the pointThe game's worth getting if you're looking for a somewhat cheap♥♥♥♥♥♥around sandbox game with a side of story but otherwise it's somewhat boring.

The only big sigh for me is that  Activision let the development team behind the franchise go so there probably won't be a prototype 3.			"

												This game took me by surprise. Most of it's parts work well, including the story, that will make it an intriguing journey along the curiosity that will spike you about how cool will be the next power you unlock. Game is very reponsive and character is very powerful and versatile, plus he is brilliantly animated. Gameplay for the most part has a strong connection to the setting: you're powerful, almost unstopable, but enemies will threath you that way: they mercilessly try to level you with tanks and missiles. If you wondered how cool would be a GTA with bllody responsive and excellent combat, get this.			"

												Awesome. It's nice to be the bad guy for once. I wanted this game from the moment it was released, but back in the day I didn't have a computer that could actually handle it. Now that it was on sale, I grabbed it. Great game. I do not understand all the negative reviews, I've had no issues whatsoever. Controls are fine, once I configured them, the resolution the game picked is the resolution I usually play games in and I had no issues with cutscenes etc.Sometimes it's a little hectic (e.g. when you have to try and take a military base down early on and are constantly assaulted by creatures), but, it's all doable. Definitely an awesome sandbox game that closes the gap between other, similarly impressive sandbox games. You can be a superhero, but don't have to care. It's great fun!			"

												Prototype's major boss fights will make you scratch your balls furiously with frustation for their tedious strategies and length.Now that I got that out of the way, I really enjoyed Prototype, I must say I'm surprised at how fluid and ridiculous the combat was. I mean, your character, Alex Mercer, can transform his arm into a giant blade, a giant hammerfist, huge muscles, a sort of sling whiplash and much more. On top of the sweet combat, the exploration is awesome. Running up skyscrapers, airdashing, and gliding across Manhattan sounds awesome on paper, and plays awesome in the game. The gameplay is clearly where the developers spent the most time, as other areas were lacking.I know the game was released in 2009, but if I compared it to other games released from 2009, or even 2008, the textures and models are put to shame, even the special effects, i.e; explosions, smoke, water, are kind of bad. There is little reaction in the water when you fall in it, when things blow up, the explosions are weak and not very volumetric, and the smoke within the explosions are unnatural. I'll take back that last one, considering how unnatural the game is, involving a virus that genetically changes people into super monsters.The story wasn't bad, but it really wasn't that much to talk about. A lot of military conspiracy, which has been done several times, but at least there were twists in the plot and Alex Mercer, as a protagonist, is awesome and kicks♥♥♥♥♥Play this game for the fun combat and gameplay, maybe for the story, but the graphics are certainly the weakest part.8.3/10			"

												Best Five Bucks I Ever SpentThe graphics are outstanding if your PC can run this game. The gameplay and story I was already familiar with from playing on the 360, but the graphics on the PC version are superior. Still worthwhile at asking price for the depth of the gameplay and intrigue of the game's well-written story and dialogue -- It casts a spell. The game has been stable so far with no crashes. Fresh from Steam, the game does not support many resolutions, but a fix is available on the hub. After installing that patch, I run the game in 1360x768 with an average between 45 and 55 FPS (High Settings)			"

Pros:-Open world exploration-Adrenaline packed gameplay-Massive variation in fighting styles-Interesting plot premiseCons:-Somewhat linear story-Repetitive gameplay-Difficult to master all fighting stylesOverall: Prototype plays a little bit like GTA, if GTA focused more on mass carnage and less on story missions.  While there is something to be said for killing everything you come into contact with, the characters have little true interaction with the world outside of missions and events.  That said, the missions and events are compelling, and gathering memories is addicting and is a clever use of the collectible side quest mechanic.The varying powers and abilities are where this game shines.  By the end of the game, you'll be doing so many different things its great.  Each ability has different uses and vastly different combos, and swapping abilities leads to very different feels.  It takes a while to master each one, but the game certainly gives you plenty of targets to practice on.  In fact, the repetitive gameplay is fixed a bit by all the different abilities you unlock - killing things is fun again when you can do it in fun new ways.All in all, it's certainly worth the price.  It's an action game.  The plot is there to give reason to the carnage, but the carnage is the main draw.  And on that front, the game definitely delivers.Bottom Line: Worth it at full price, but goes on sale frequently enough to merit waiting for one.			"

												One of Activision's (if you want to get technical, Radical's, but since their out of buisness, we'll be calling this Activision's game) best game in ages, it's from 2009, and it still hold's up today.The story is solid, it will leave you wanting more and more answers as you progress, and it throws a real curve ball at you when you learn the truth. There's also a ton of extra bits and pieces you can find by seeking out and consuming (more on that later)  certain people, called ""Web of Intrigue"" targets, and my hat goes off to the people who made those cutscenes, because they looked pretty painful to make. But there are a few sections in the story where you'll be left confused, and with no answers, none. So for the story, 8/10.The graphics are a bit dated, but can look pretty good in some parts, especially on the PC. And you'll encounter little to no frame rate issues, or crashes. And the animation is quite nice as well. But there are a few audio glitches, especially in the cutscenes. 7/10The gameplay is amazing, it's hack and slash for some parts, and beat them to a bloody pulp for others, and there are so many combos in the game, an astounding ammount. You're also going to want to use a controller if one is handy, I felt the game didn't work well for a keyboard, and was glad I had my controller with me. But consuming is really quite interesting, you can grab a target and more or less ""eat"" them, but you gain their form, memories, etc. etc. etc. But the boss battles felt painfully OP, and I was playing on normal for my first time through. I had the most trouble with the last boss, as he was a damage sponge, there were other people attacking me, and if that's not enough, there's a timer. His attacks also did an insane ammount of damage. Gameplay earns a solid 9/10So, the story is great, one of the best one's I've experienced in a while, close to the level that the original inFAMOUS gave you in terms of depth. Still, it has verry odd bits and pieces missing from it that could of easily been included. Graphics could of been better (i.e. inFAMOUS was released around the same time, and look at how it looked) and the gameplay is awesome. So my final score for [PROTOTYPE] is an 8/10, pick this game up, it is a must have.			"

												OkayGame play wise, its okay. Nothing to freak out about. I mean you got your destroy everything, but since thats basiclly all of todays games in general there's nothing special about it. As far as story goes. Ive seen games like this all the time, your some guy who gains powers of incredible poportions and you go to seek revenge against the bad guy yada yada yada. If you dont belive me look at the games such as, Infamous (the whole inteir series), Dishonerd, Bioshock infinite, and so on. So as far as story wise, its pretty basic.This game is nothing to aw at, but that does not mean you shouldn't get it (well at least while its on sale)My Gaming Score5 Hungry Alexses/10			"

												Prototype reminds me bit of The Hulk : Video game, same concept except, can not destroy buildings. Gameplay is decent (what do you want more besides smacking or consuming people and blowing up armored vehicles) even tho game itself counts as open world it does not have any side missions just challenges and searching for collectables. Story wise, not bad could excite new players. Find what happened.... What actually happened to Alex Mercer.Game does work on W7 64bit.			"

												This is an extended review about Prototype, so before starting, let me sai it short. This is a very cool game, but full of bugs and glitches in the Steam version. I bought it on sale, and I suggest doing the same thing. Now, let's start with the extended review.STORY/GAMEPLAY: This is a sanbox game. very unique in its kind. In spite of being the typical delinquent who wants to rule the mafia, the main character is a human infected by a special virus that allows him to absorb other living beings, and mutate part of his body. There are a great deal of ""natural weapons"" to use, and also the environment is pretty much destroyable, with the exception of building. The story in my opinion is the shining point of this game, and the funny thing is that it's not explained at all in the beginning, but it's revealet little by little through special events (that last far over the ""main story"", if you want to collect all pieces of it).The free roaming is quite good. It's cool being this spiderman-like character, and desn't get boring over time.GRAPHICS: Graphics are average. The main character and the cinematics are quite pretty, but the rest sucks pretty much. There are 10 to 15 ""characters"" in the game, so the world feels pretty monotonous and dull. The building are quite monotonous too, put together with a little variety. Despite this you can feel some slowdown when there are many enemies on the screen, even if you have a last generation video card.BUGS: If I understand correctly, this is an xbox/ps porting, so it's full of bugs and glithces. Looking on the internet you can manage to fix pretty much everything, but still sucks having to ""open new game > return to main meny > load saved game"", or else the game crashes.AI: Artificial intelligence just sucks. After just a couple of hours of game you can perfectly predict what will happen, even what moves your enemies will do. I think that you can pretty much expect it from a sandbox game, but the overall scarce variety of character is quite dull.I think that's all. To sum up, this is a short list of pros and cons.PROs:- very good story- feels incredibly cool- complete it 100% is quite challengingCONs:- bugs- AI- graphics (i put in the cons because of the overall effect, and the slowdowns)That's all. Hope this review is helpful.			"

												Prototype reminds me bit of The Hulk : Video game, same concept except, can not destroy buildings. Gameplay is decent (what do you want more besides smacking or consuming people and blowing up armored vehicles) even tho game itself counts as open world it does not have any side missions just challenges and searching for collectables. Story wise, not bad could excite new players. Find what happened.... What actually happened to Alex Mercer.Game does work on W7 64bit.			"

												This is an extended review about Prototype, so before starting, let me sai it short. This is a very cool game, but full of bugs and glitches in the Steam version. I bought it on sale, and I suggest doing the same thing. Now, let's start with the extended review.STORY/GAMEPLAY: This is a sanbox game. very unique in its kind. In spite of being the typical delinquent who wants to rule the mafia, the main character is a human infected by a special virus that allows him to absorb other living beings, and mutate part of his body. There are a great deal of ""natural weapons"" to use, and also the environment is pretty much destroyable, with the exception of building. The story in my opinion is the shining point of this game, and the funny thing is that it's not explained at all in the beginning, but it's revealet little by little through special events (that last far over the ""main story"", if you want to collect all pieces of it).The free roaming is quite good. It's cool being this spiderman-like character, and desn't get boring over time.GRAPHICS: Graphics are average. The main character and the cinematics are quite pretty, but the rest sucks pretty much. There are 10 to 15 ""characters"" in the game, so the world feels pretty monotonous and dull. The building are quite monotonous too, put together with a little variety. Despite this you can feel some slowdown when there are many enemies on the screen, even if you have a last generation video card.BUGS: If I understand correctly, this is an xbox/ps porting, so it's full of bugs and glithces. Looking on the internet you can manage to fix pretty much everything, but still sucks having to ""open new game > return to main meny > load saved game"", or else the game crashes.AI: Artificial intelligence just sucks.

												The only flaws I have with this game are the controls at some points, and the graphics, other than that you should totally get this one. Plus it runs well on crappy computers. The storyline isn't that good either though, I just found myself having a good time creating chaos through each mission.			"

												In Prototype you play as a man named Alex fighting against a shadowy government entity that he’s very mad at for giving him godlike superpowers. I would try to explain the plot further, but I honestly can’t. The volume drops inexplicity to whispers in all of the game’s cutscenes - it’s as if the voice actors themselves are embarrassed at taking part in this travesty.You’ll battle the government and the plague monsters infecting an island that looks as if someone attempted to draw Manhattan without ever having been there - or even Googled it to see what it looks like. Fortunately, you’ll have a lot of cool powers at your disposal to help you. Unfortunately, thanks to Prototype’s overly complicated control system, you won’t figure how out how to use half of them. It doesn’t help that, despite Alex’s ability to hijack a helicopter in midair and bodyslam a tank, he can’t properly block. This becomes a problem as the creators of this game think that the way to make Prototype’s later missions be more challenging is for them to simply throw thousands of enemies at your face. The longer the game goes the more frustrating it becomes.Ultimately, Prototype can be a fun way to spend a few hours, but you’ll quickly question why you keep playing it.			"

Posted: January 20, 2016
												TL,DR: Great idea, terrible implementation.There is nothing that disappoints me more than lost potential. When I heard about this game, I loved the premise. Be an evil god! Leaping through the city, unleasing your unspeakable power on the hapless citizens! And sometimes, that's what I got. Most times however, what I got was a buggy, lazy, difficult-to-control mess.I have some ideas what happened here. 1) The open world's so big, and there's so many missions and events and kaka, the designers didn't put all the effort they should have into polishing and playtesting. I can't help but contrast this game against something like Portal, that's small but perfectly tuned. I didn't expect THAT from Prototype, but I would have happily swapped a few missions and events for more time taken working the bugs out of the others. 2) From what I've read of other people's complaints, this is a really lazy port. The fact alone that this started as a console game explains some of my frustration, as there are simply too many options mapped to too few keys, leading to frequent raging when I meant to do one thing and something else happened.I did finish the game. I finished nearly all of the events. And I'm not just calling a game bad because I sucked at it. In events where I actually felt like I was fighting NPCs instead of gameplay and glitches, I did fine. I got gold in most events, some on the first try. My frustration wasn't from lack of skill, but from things like...*There are kill missions where you are supposed to use a certain weapon or power. Half the challenge is keeping the game from defaulting to kicking and jumping attacks that won't count towards your score.*Sometimes no matter how much I selected the whipfist, I wouldn't transform into it. No other power had this problem (Until the final boss, where I kept getting locked into previous powers and being unable to change them for a minute or so).*I beat an event with four seconds clearly left on the clock and it said I'd failed it.*Watching my character destroy infected water towers, yet the game says they hatched before I did.*Game gives you incorrect advice on how to proceed with a helicopter mission: ""Hold TAB and flick mouse to select another detector""*I lost track of the number of times NPCs killed off a Web Of Intrigue target before I could get to them. I lost an event MULTIPLE TIMES because of this.*A Consume Event icon on my map; no event or marker in the area when I'm directly at the spot. Followed by a Consume Event marker floating in midair with no corresponding event.*I consume a target in an event, the game says the target died and doesn't count it. I was IN the animation of consuming it!*Accidentally hit escape during an event; this aborts the event instead of pausing the game.*Targeting is gambling. Most of the time my attacks would hit just fine, but sometimes the game would decide that I'd much rather punch a helicopter than the Hunter I targeted.*Sound was really low, even at the highest volume.*Was supposed to protect a tank. Control was taken away from me while the game played a cutscene. During this cutscene, hunters attacked the tank and crippled it. I had absolutely no way to stop them.*Boss battle against a Supreme Hunter. Suddenly ""Objective Completed"" without me having done anything, leaving me feeling cheated of a good fight.*I had to kill 100 enemies for an event. At 99 kills, the game stopped producing NPCs so I lost the event.*Timed kill event located in an area with tons of low fences, preventing me from getting to enemies or enemies getting to me.*Frequently getting stuck inside tanks despite clicking 'E' tons of times.*Lost a Movement event twice because the game suddenly put me in my armor, which meant I dropped out of parkour and lost precious seconds trying to get the armor off.And you know what? I could forgive all of that, but the final straw was how TWO CUTSCENES THAT OCCUR DURING MISSIONS WILL CRASH THE GAME, MEANING YOU WILL HAVE TO START THOSE MISSIONS ALL OVER AGAIN AFTER YOU RESTART. The cutscene plays; fade to black; game is completely frozen. And it wasn't just me: I saw many, many people on many different websites describing the crash in The Stolen Body and Men Like Gods. Supposedly it's a corrupted audio file. It's unforgivable that this hasn't been patched by now.So yeah, there were moments of occasional triumph. I liked a lot of the powers, the whipfist especially. when the game worked, it actually did feel pretty damn great. But those moments were rare. This was a game where 'flow' should have happened way, WAY more than it ever did. I got this for five bucks during a Steam sale and feel ripped off.Also, I'm gonna be hearing those bedamned military alarm sirens in my sleep for weeks.			"

												Well what can I say? It honestly pains me to write a negative review as I truly lovvve this game! I've even completed it several times on PS3 and was hoping to do so right here on PC however, there is ONE MAJOR PROBLEM...The game crashes during the loading screen when either selecting ""New Game"" or ""Continue""Now, I wouldn't make such a big deal of this if there were some way around it, but there's almost NO solutions out there... No patches by the community OR the developers to adress this issue, but instead, I've read several times to disable hyper-threading in my BIOS. Now I'm 100% certain I'm running on a system MORE than capable of handling a game of this sort. To be bluntly honest here, it is BAD programming and poor decisions of which have caused this problem and it is rather pathetic that the devs or publishers have allowed this to drag on.			"

												The only reason I am not recommending it is because it's broken.Start up the game , press play and it crashes. No chance of a fix = broken & waste of money.[edit]Someone in my comments got butthurt and tried to blame me for this problem.It is a development issue , not a user issue. When your system is "" 1 x Gigabyte Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070Asrock x79 Fatal1ty Champion socket LGA 2011Intel Core i7 4930K Hex core Ivy Bridge-E32gb Gskill RipjawZ 1600mhz ""and the only way to resolve the problem is dumbing down your system by "" lowering the hyper thread in bios ""  ..... THE GAME IS BROKEN. It is a development problem. It is a waste of money if you are running anything better than a toaster.So save your butthurt for your mother , because I don't care to hear it.The only problem here that is mine is I wasted my money , and I'm trying to save other people from wasting theirs too.

												Prototype is weird. But I guess in a way a lot of that weirdness is due to the fact that it's been out for a while.The start is weird. The plot moves very quickly, characters act rashly, Alex feels very slippery to control, and there's quite a few things to keep track of.The middle is weird. The plot slows down to a crawl, things get really confusing and characters suddenly drop off the face of the earth, but it's about this point where everything starts coming together combat-wise and you feel pretty damn powerful.The late game is weird. The plot remains sporatic, everything feels sporatic, and suddenly it becomes very difficult to do things you once found easy because there are little things that chip away at your health EVERYWHERE. It's hard to figure out just how to do what the game wants you to do.The end is weird. Things finally speed up again but go a little too fast and suddenly you're at the end after long stretches of feeling that you were lingering around the middle, the final boss comes out of nowhere after a pretty awesome sequence that manages to avoid some of the game's earlier annoyances, just in time for a weird final boss fight.Plus you always have to move around everywhere along a large open area, one end to the other. While this is encouraged by lots of little things to do inbetween so you can upgrade your skills, I felt like a lot of skills were just plain unnecessary. A LOT of things felt unnecessary. But ultimately I left sorta positively with this game? I mean I played it enough to finish it and I found it somewhat solid, though now slightly dated. It does give you a great feeling of empowerment while covering you with challenge, it's just still very weird.About 11 hours of weird with lots of highs and lows deserves a recommendation I guess. Just note that what you're doing in the beginning of the game won't change much even towards the end.			"

												This game's biggest problem is the checkpoints which can require hours to get thru if you die plenty of times and the game crashes too often, having to repeat the same missions over and over.  It can be unfair at points, like supposed allies crashing helicopters into yours, and there is no way to skip over stuff you've seen over and over.  On the other hand, it is decent enough thru the story and there are plenty of side challenges to occupy your time, even if you give up achieving the highest rating on all of them.  8/10			"

Too Buggy Can't play in 1080p because of a bug where it doesn't detect over 1.5GB of VRAM Sound on cutscenes is weird. The music stutters, but there are certain sounds, like the bullets impacting the creatures, that  remain clear. This may be caused by the audio sampling rate Very low fps (15 fps), which may be apparently caused by a bug pertaining to HID devices that aren't being usedThere's a whole host of other issues reported by other users. Even when others have fixed the above issues, by replacing a .dll file here and there, adjusting audio rates, temporarily disabling input devices, etc., they are then left with new errors and bugs, one of the most infamous is when the audio becomes high-pitched, like a chimpmunk. Some have also mentioned twitching mice. It very obviously is a port, and it is an extremely bad one.  I have a PS3, this is an old game and I'm not putting this much effort into putting my PC in a weird, temporary, ad hoc state just to run this game. I've never seen a game that has had multiple bugs and that are this extreme. The developer doesn't exist anymore, so there doesn't seem to be any support available. Looks like a great game, and I really liked the first few seconds immediately. The bugs can be fixed, and this game can be put into a playable state on PC, with some effort and problem solving, because it seems to depend on the hardware one has. It also works with an Xbox controller (so also PS4) even though it says it isn't made for controllers. I'll enjoy playing this, but on PS3.Good luck to anyone who attempts to get this game running in an acceptable state!			"

												Dumb as ♥♥♥♥ AI completely breaks immersion and makes the game completely unplayable for me.For the best example: As a  wanted man with superduper powers you are able to survive a fall from the tallest skyscraper towards the crowded street but nobody cares about the fact you has just made a 5 meters wide concrete crater just by falling on the ground and you are fine after that. However when you slightly punch a car you are immediately identified by cililians/military and an entire city is after you. WTF?I don't know who the ♥♥♥♥ even allowed for this flaw and what he even thought... that it would make this game more accesisable for consumers ?			"

												Take on the role of Alex Mercer, a man who has no recollection of what’s happened to him or why, or how he came to acquire the shape-shifting powers he now possesses. Find the people who’ve done that to you and make them pay.The game -action, adventure, open worldish- sounded fun and looked fun, and I was very hyped to play it. I was also very disappointed when I finally did. Controls, though a bit wonky, are not difficult. You can change your body “at will” to attack enemies and destroy things, and when I say “at will” I mean you only have so many things you can change into. I think the most fun aspect of the game is the fact that you can ‘consume’ random people and then turn into them, and run/jump your way around pretty freely. I’d say the graphics are dated, but it’s an oldish game, so it gets a slight pass for that. What it doesn’t get a pass for, however, is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance. For a 2009 game that should run like a charm on my computer, it sure worked like crap even at the lowest settings, lagging worse than Assassin’s Creed III - and at least that one had a reason to lag (no “low” video settings, hey). I’m also not particularly fond of the reddish/orangeish filter they use on later cinematics and gameplay time, I find it bothersome to look at. Your character is overpowered, which is not bad in itself if you like an easy game, but it does make things boring after a while as it’s all the same; to tell the truth, it reminded me a little of God Hand for some reason, only that one was actually fun to keep playing. With Prototype, I did the first few missions and was bored out of my mind - that along with the slightly eye-hurting graphics and slight, random spikes of lag made the game truly disappointing. The gameplay is pretty repetitive otherwise. Fight a bunch of bad guys, have them call in tanks and an airstrike, be chased, shake them off, rinse and repeat with a moderate variety of enemies and mutants to fight against. It’s not a completely unplayable game, mind you. If you’re extremely bored and want to play something that doesn’t pose a huge challenge, it’s not a bad game and could even be considered entertaining. I liked the city, the chance to explore it some, the general idea of the game was good (though the story was a bit hit and miss with me), but the execution left a lot to be desired. Perhaps if the game had lagged a bit less I would have enjoyed it a bit better.I wouldn’t recommend this game, but I would certainly not tell you to steer clear from it either, as I feel it could be a lot more fun if you can actually play it sans the lag.

												If there is such a game that can represent me, then that has to be Prototype. The reason is kind of simple. During the winter time back in highschool, I always wore a black jacket and a white hoodie inside, and blue jeans (In fact, I still wear them today), making myself look like Alex Mercer in a way. Did I wear like that so that I can look like Alex Mercer? No. I wore those even before the game Prototype was announced, so basically I felt that I had to give this game a try, as it looked as though the main character himself was myself. And basically I beat this game on 360 a long time ago, and I remember myself having a real great time with it. And recently I bought myself the Steam version and have to say, the game is still a good ol' Prototype. Basically you are Alex Mercer, who is almost like a superman. The helicopters, tanks and tons of military men try to kill you all at once, but no worries, you are Alex Mercer, you have the ability to heal yourself by devouring zombies or people and no one can match your running speed and power. It is also possible to upgrade your powers and purchase new skills so that you can unleash extremely powerful move against your foes as well. But because of the fact that Alex Mercer is so overpowered, you better be moving fast otherwise, you may die quickly. I remember the game being pretty challenging back in the days, and even though I already beat it once, I still kind of feel some parts are still somewhat challenging. Overall, great action game. 10 out of 10.			"

												A very awesome game to buy. This game lets you do something that every gamer has ever wanted... Free roaming... And it's also a stress reliever.Seriously though, get this game. When I first heard about this game, I felt like it was just GTA all over again. Well, I was wrong. This game lets you consume anyone at anytime and disguise as them. You also consume whatever is a part of them, like their memories. But this game isn't all about cannibalism, it's about fighting for what you want... To legally eat people and infected monsters...When the whole military is against you, what are the odds that you'll survive? The truth is... You won't. Not unless you're Alex Mercer, who can shapeshift into various weapons, has super strength and super speed, and parkour on buildings. Practically, he's a walking war machine. I promise this to anyone that they will enjoy Prototype since the story also helps contribute to the game.			"

												This is a great game good story line, fun gameplay and awesome abilities. I only have a few complaints one that the soliders are stupid it was humorus and that the dialouge is EXTREMeLY QUIET even at full volume but other than that it's a great game and im suprised for all that the makers made in the game at the time. Now Prototype 2 may fix my complaints but playing the first game will most likely let you know  the villain in Prototype 2 better and feel more remorse for him. Anyways in all if you find interest in the game or idea im only saying it's a damn good game.			"

												Clearly say's i don't have many hours on this game or none at all when i wrote this recommendation (And steams 5 minute gameplay before posting review) however i had quite a bit from when i played this on the PS3 which i don't have anymore so i am happy to have found it on Steam If distruction and choas and some funny achivements (Which i noticed after writing this review that it does not have achivements for the PC version it seems) is your thing than i highly recommend this game What other game let's you drive tanks in new york running over cars and flatining them like pancakes or drive a bonus tank that shoots shells that act like a mini nucular bomb while watching cars and people go flying as a resualt or flying attack helicopters and being able to highjack them while they are in the air.Being able to jump redicuoles distances and throwing cars like your a mini version of the hulk Also turning yourself into a human tank (Though i wouldn't classifie Alex Mercer as human) and plowing through anything in your path (minus buildings) running up the side of sky scrapers and much more The story line i found was actually good not really any games i play just for the story line however i found this one to be an exception My personal preferance for games are open world racing games and simulaters or games like GTA seriesThough this game doesn't let you drive civilian vehicles i'm alright with the fact they let you drive tanks and fly helicopters But to each there own.The graphics are good at least to me they are.It's open world which i like though i wish you could explore all of New York like outside the quorinteen zone controls are easy though going from the PS3 to PC could be interesting Least it gives a tutorial on the controls at the begining of the game Well guess if you find my recommending usefull then you can find your own impression of the game Have fun.

												Prototype is a third-person apocalyptic open-world type of game. It has an interesting plot even if it can be a little bit confusing at times, especially since Alex Mercer wakes up with amnesia and there's a virus spreading. It turns out Alex Mercer also has gained some special powers. By consuming certain people you can find out a bit more story and fit some of it together throughout the game.The side-events/missions aren't very special and I found myself skipping most of them in the end because they felt repetitive and the points you earn to upgrade your abilities can be earned most of the time through other ways. After completing the game you gain access to free-roam mode (and New Game+), where you can complete all the challenges if you'd like to. The gameplay is great. I loved running, jumping and soaring around the city in a fast pace. Almost everything earns you points that you can spend on unlocking abilities and upgrading almost everything you can think of. Some upgrades, like weaponry, do require that you do certain side-events but they're not really something that you'll need to use much. In the end Alex Mercer seems almost invincible. Some parts of the game requires a little bit of ""stealth"" and some parts require that you get things done quickly. It's a nice mix.The game came out a few years ago but it has aged well, in my opinion. Sure, it's not the greatest looking game compared to some of the current AAA titles - the important thing is that it's not ugly. Alex Mercer's movements are smooth and detailed compared to the rest of the NPCs, but it's to be expected. What's rather nice with the visuals are that as the infection spreads, more and more of the city will look infected, it adds to the immersion.I can really recommend this game, especially if you like open-world games. It's a great game that I had a lot of fun with.			"

												In Prototype, you play as a successful scientist named Alex Mercer, who one day wakes up from a coma to find out he has shapeshifting powers, and has lost his memories. He also finds out that a mysterious infection has broken out in NYC, causing people to become mutated into a zombie like creature, and they just want to kill everything that is not them. So, as Mercer, you try to find out what has happened to you and NYC, but then, the military comes to ♥♥♥♥ your♥♥♥♥♥♥up, due to unknown(BUT OBVIOUS WHEN YOU PLAY) reasons. So, as Mercer, you get tired of everyone's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and decide to ♥♥♥♥ everyone's day up. You can eat someone, grab them with your rope fist, and throw them across the town. You can use your Hammerfists to smash them into paste. You can use your Armor to cover yourself in BioMaterial, and slowly walk towards them, just taking all of their shots, and then stomp them to death. Basically, you have lots of options.6/1o, because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story missions that feel the same, and once you get every power, the game isn't worth coming back to.			"

AI is crapshoot: civilians run straight into your tank to die, and the problem expands in the escort missions.Gameplay is fun, but they throw way too many new moves at you expecting you to pick up the various key combos instantly. Game gets repetitive after a while, and side missions are neither fun nor necessary.The most common mook has high health and is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to fight.Story and characters are a jumbled mess. Apparently Alex wants revenge on the military for giving him superpowers.If you know me, you know I love movement-based gameplay, and the heavy free running focus is definitely great, but even after a while running around the city to the next mission becomes a chore.On top of that, animations are jarring because it was designed with analog stick in mind.Afaik, Radical mainly deals in movie license games.

												A worthy successor to Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction. There is something incredible when you get in the infected zone and sweep away dozens of mutants and slow-mo into a tentacle devastator. Moves are too cheap and then you have a couple missions before 15 upgrades become available that either cost marginally more or several times. Side missions are not so creative and having 10 times the amount of soldiers can mess up your destruction derby too quickly.			"

But also tells you core upgrades which you will NEED to have to complete the missions with ease. The story is easy even on the hardest difficulty, but this is what makes the game fun. Cutting down whole armies and simply throwing people across rooftops makes the game fun, and an overall pleasure to play. 9/10 would buy			"

It's pure carnage on a whole new misanthropic level.  Having just completed the campaign the whole White People Are Evil™ theme they used kind of pisses me off...

												What an unexpected gem this is. Though I'm a sucker for games telling a decent story, I just wanted something casual when I was starting [Prototype]. Well, this game is both. The story is interesting enough (nothing exceptional but works anyway) and free roaming inbetween missions (which is the ""casual"" aspect of the game) is enjoyable. When I'm tired of free roaming or when there's nothing else to do, I return to main missions. A fun game which will last a lot longer than I expected.			"

												Imagine a game where you play as a slightly more bad♥♥♥♥♥variant of the president from Saints Row IV, now imagine that the storyline makes some sense and on top of that is a zombie game that is genuinely fun to play where you actually care about the story.You play Alex Mercer, An ex-human self modifying virus that seems to be a genetically engineered evolution of humanity who has lost his memories after dying before the game even began and you want answers, Technically the bulk of the game is just the player reliving what has happened since he woke up on a slab leading up to the games present day.It's the kind of game where within the first hour you've gained giant claws that you can use to tear people in half and the ability to take the shape of those you've killed, You admit you're a terrorist and despite being what many would see as evil you are the lesser evil, or are you?10/10, hope like hell someone picks up the franchise at some point and we can see a [PROTOTYPE] 3 some day.

												First thing first, I had absolutely lots of fun with this game. Just the sheer amount of destruction you are capable of doing is incredible. The hero has so grossly overpowered he literally rips to shreds everything he encounters, from regular people, through tanks and helicopter to disgusting and huge mutants. Action is satisfying and story, B-rated as it is, has a nice twist at the end. The reason I must say no, is that the game has some technical difficulties and it took me a few hours browsing through internet discussion and trying a lot of things to get it run normally on more than 3 FPS.

												Well, the gameplay itself is like a newer Hulk: Ultimate Destruction. That's great and all, but I ran into a terrible bug with the sound. All the sound effects and music are sped up when you're in the levels, and it's horrible, squeaky, and it's impossible to tolerate. If there's ever a patch, I'll re-install this game in a heartbeat.			"

												Imagine a game where you play as a slightly more bad♥♥♥♥♥variant of the president from Saints Row IV, now imagine that the storyline makes some sense and on top of that is a zombie game that is genuinely fun to play where you actually care about the story.You play Alex Mercer, An ex-human self modifying virus that seems to be a genetically engineered evolution of humanity who has lost his memories after dying before the game even began and you want answers, Technically the bulk of the game is just the player reliving what has happened since he woke up on a slab leading up to the games present day.It's the kind of game where within the first hour you've gained giant claws that you can use to tear people in half and the ability to take the shape of those you've killed, You admit you're a terrorist and despite being what many would see as evil you are the lesser evil, or are you?10/10, hope like hell someone picks up the franchise at some point and we can see a [PROTOTYPE] 3 some day.

												I enjoyed this game for a while, but it became far to frustrating to actually enjoy.  The premise is interesting, and the gameplay can be very fun, especially with the power to bounce around manhattan and wreak absolute havoc.  But there are points in the game that are so frustrating that they simply make the game unenjoyable.  I don't want to spend an hour doing the same repetitive pop in, blow something up. run away, fight off 10 helicopters, go stealthy, start over thing with every damn task in the game.  it just stops being fun. when the game glitched at the end and I can't get past a specific cut scene, I simply gave up.  It's not even worth even finding out what the ending is, because the game is so frustrating and repetitive.  I don't say this often, but I just didn't this game that much.  Interesting and different, but repetitive and frustrating are the bottom lines.  The controls can be a bit aggravating as well.			"

This fun is, however, very shallow and does not sustain itself for very long.

												DONT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET SCREWED!!!!!!First off, these games have ENORMOUS FPS issues. I managed to fix them for the first installment, but I shouldnt have to(it should have a patch!!!!)Secondly, I cannot get Prototype 2 to work. Where it used to crash within 2 seconds of executing the application, I got past that and now its THE MOST INTENSE FPS ISSUE IVE EVER FACED.......Activision, you blow, suck, squeeze, bang, and blew your load in our mouths for the prices you charge for these installments that DONT work. If you are going to port a game over to PC....Atleast have the decency to patch problems that come along with it. DONT START A PROJECT AND NOT FINISH IT!!!!!ACTIVISION: Until you patch these AMAZINGLY CRAFTED titles and make them run as they should for the prices you charge since they are NEVER on sale, you as a company will NEVER see my business again. My wallet has bigger and better things to empty itself on than to invest in the worthless stock of infected ignorant brain matter that you refer to as your product.Sincerely,VERY♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥OFF X-CUSTOMER...........

The story is interesting enough (nothing exceptional but works anyway) and free roaming inbetween missions (which is the ""casual"" aspect of the game) is enjoyable. When I'm tired of free roaming or when there's nothing else to do, I return to main missions. A fun game which will last a lot longer than I expected.			"

Product received for free
												I liked this one more than the second one but I can't recommend it. If you really want it, just buy it for PS3 or 360. The only way I could ever get it to work was to turn off hyper threading in my BIOS. I'm not going to do that every single time I want to play the game and reset my computer to turn HT back on when I'm done playing. Lucky for me I got this game for free for buying Prototype 2. Activision never had any intention to have the devs fix the problem and the devs never cared to make it work right in the first place. Activision kind of doesn't care about PC gamers. I'm genuinely surprised at how many good reviews this game has with such a widespread problem. There are countless forums littered across the internet with countless people that can't get the game working.			"

												I orginally played Prototype on the 360 back in the day and enjoyed it, although i remembered there being really stupid parts that I didn't enjoy. Either way, I decided to beat the main story once again, but in a single sitting because I didn't expect it to take too terribly long. (about 8 hours).Everything went as I expected it would, It's a fun game to play when you want to goof off and free roam. You can endlessly kill pretty much anything and you have a lot of ways to do so. That's the good aspect of the game.The bad comes in during the boss fights, the most effective way I found to kill the bosses was using the muscle enhancing power to increase the effectiveness of objects you throw and to continuously run around finding anything laying around to chuck at the boss. This becomes a very long, drawn out, and boring process, being repeated about four times during the course of the main story.All in all, I DO recommend Prototype if you'd like to have a game where you are all powerful and just want to run around and break stuff.

												This game is a prime example of what happens when people that think game consoles were a good idea try to develop video games. Apart from the usual UI horrors (lengthy, yet unskippable ""presented by"" sequence at every start, ""do not turn off power while the game is saving"" notice at every start, extremely inaccurate mouse tracking, etc.), the aspect ratio is messed up (huge black borders; I've seen others complain about this on the forums, so it seems it isn't just me), the controls are clearly geared towards (gag) gamepads and the list goes on with all the classic nonsense that happens when a game is developed for consoles and then back-ported to PC.What really tipped the balance is the fact that the performance is completely ruined by what, judging from what I read on the forums, is likely some severe issue with detecting the controls. After having spent days getting Final Fantasy XIII (which exhibits a similar issue) to run halfway decently, I frankly can't be <kinsoku jikou>ed to find a series of hacks just to circumvent this ridiculous performance hit. Even on a state-of-the-art PC that runs all other (properly developed!) games smoothly on high quality settings, this game can only be described as ""unplayable"" on PC. While there might or might not be ways to fix this up (apparently involving downloading hacked versions of game DLLs from shady one click hoster sites -- DO NOT DO THIS, you'll be inviting viruses, trojans and whatnot onto your system!), it can only be said that the average Joe (as in, somebody that isn't a computer expert) would have little chance to get this game to work properly (without blindly following quite dangerous instructions off the internet, anyway, cf. the bit about the modified DLLs).On a more technical note, apparently there is a cap on the amount of video memory and exceeding this cap restricts the quality settings severly. The very fact that this cap is 2 GB rather than 4 GB (i.e. the so-called engine uses a signed integer to represent memory size) is quite indicative of whoever wrote this game not knowing anywhere near enough about programming to even think about making video games. I'm sorry, and this is not supposed to be flame bait, nor an insult, nor to be taken personally, but the preceding is simply a fact.Bottom line: Unplayable on PC; cannot, in good conscience, recommend.

												The Unreal Engine 3 is pretty standard fare but it's definitely not been fully utilized. Will add more later. It's worse than Prototype 2 but that's a given. At least some parts are more realistic. E.g. The viral detectors are far more sensitive in this version.PROS1. Good storyI like how it goes. I'm quite curious as to how the story ends.CONS1. Movements are clunkya. You can only run upwards on the walls, not sidewaysb. If you run upwards into the rafters, you flip backwards2. AI is dumbIf you land from a 50-storey building in a black ops disguise, no one seems to be suspicious.3. Combat is horrendousYou can't fix onto a single target enemy and you swing all over the place. Swinging would be good if your reach was far enough but it's so pathetic. You tend to punch instead of using your claws as well.4. Combat is lameCollecting genetic materials was so lame. You are basically running around a zone collecting shiny bubbles. You are a living weapon not a bubble collector.5. FlashbacksIt's basically cheap voice acting. The images are re-used over and over again.			"

												Simply moving from place to place is fun because the character will basically jump over, crush, slap aside, and bowl over any object between him and where he is going without slowing down. The camera is done perfectly and the controls are great.Your character's super powers are a mix of Spawn, Venom, and the Incredible Hulk, all at the same time and in concert. One errant swipe from one of your several melee weapons will completely eviscerate someone, causing onlookers to beg for their lives, spontaneously vomit, and instantly lose their sanity forever. One purposeful swipe will dismember a crowd of people. Simply wading through crowds and annihilating defenseless people becomes like a work of art, since there are so many ways to do it. If you get bored of using super powers, jump in a tank or helicopter (it's very easy) and crush everything. One of the special attacks is to impale everyone within about sixty feet on giant stone spikes, leaving behind a mound of ruined corpses.			"

												This game is possibly the biggest influence for Saints Row 4, however, I'd say it's not anywhere near as good. The story is hard to follow (might be because the voice acting is terrible, could also be because the story is kinda really very boring).For a 2009 game, the visuals are really horrible. Lighting and shadows seemed a little closer to 2006 levels (I was playing with everything maxed out)The controls were alright, though it wasn't anywhere near refined enough so the game felt cluggy from time to time.The game most likely requires some work to get running well. With Nvidia cards, it's less of an issue, but almost everyone seems to suffer frame rate issues of some sort. If you are running with the an Nvidia card, I'd suggest leaving Vsync off in game and use the control panel (This should really be standard practise).			"

												Hell no.Only thing better than the second game on here is the story, and Alex as the character. Which you can get in the second game, so really only the story is better here.The combat is♥♥♥♥♥♥Why target any of the 30 enemies infront of me, when you can target a broken, unthreatening tank behind them?Why grab the enemy infront of me when you can turn to the left and grab a giant rock or car?The absorbing is so ♥♥♥♥ing slow. Second game, you grab a dude, jump, slam him down and instantly absorb him. Here, he has to do some long fancy move first which is EASY stopped if you are even tapped.Their idea of challenge is put you in a small location where YOU are the target of everything. First you fight humans, who half have grenade and rocket launchers that bounce you everywhere when you are trying to fight. Then are blessed by large monsters that are fast as hell and can easily throw you around too. Which they find then a equal hate for just you, and you then have 40 enemies to then deal with.Bravo! :DI honestly see 0 playing value in it. Even for 1 more second of my time. It is among 1 of the worst experiences with a game I had to deal with.I am just sad I can't still get a refund and buy something worth the money.I played games with bad stories but the gameplay kept me coming back. But this has a ok story with god awful gameplay. It can be fun, until you keep getting long repetitive missions over and over.Here are 90% the missions:*Destroy 10 of these acrossed the map.*Guard this for 20 minutes.With the every so often:*Kill this guygame is like a 4/10 for me. I envy the people who couldn't get it to run for them. They atleast could get a refund.			"

Good luck using the dash dodge when you can't see anything around you either. This will be important as everybody will gang up on you all the time. Also, despite supposedly being a living god the only real strategy is run away and throw things. Aside from that the story is pretty meh. The cutscenes are truly awful although I did like the whole ""web of intrigue"" idea. Some of that stuff was genuinely chilling.Play Saints Row 4 instead, different feel, more fun.			"

												This is generally an ok game. Wouldn't say it's amazing or well worth the money. It's fun to be strong enough to lift tanks, nab pedestrians by the neck and run around the city with them flailing about. Oh, and did I mention that we get to drive tanks and pilot helicopters?Well, those are basically the only good parts of the game other than being able to shape shift and have claws for hands or hulk arms. Then there are the issues of repetitive missions and AI drawing. The missions are like I said, repetitive. You either infiltrate a base, consume some target or just blow things up. Also, enemies instantly respawn right in front of you like poof and then proceed to bomb you for all your HP.So yeah, grab it if it's less than 5 bucks IMHO.			"

												The world is pretty large and varied and the powers are fun as hell. But the combat in the game is just abysmal and you will spend 90% of all boss fights and large encounters stun locked. About the worst thing you can do to a player is not let him do anything in combat except be ragdolled around because literally every enemy down to the smallest soldier has a gigiantic aoe attack that stuns you. Hope you like getting chained down 100 to 0 over and over again. Unless you like running in hitting one punch and then jumping away to heal 70% of your health for 1 minute so you can jump in and punch once again. Just painful and slow. It may have fine in 09 when this came out on console but it has not aged well. Story is good at least.			"

												I haven't even gotten into the game yet. But there is this incredibly stupid glitch. That the dev's haven't even bothered to attempt to fix. The games resolution will be stuck at a max of 1280x800. In order to get around this, you have to do a ton of messing around with files (potentially downloading a .dll file to replace theirs, so that you can get a full 1080p resolution.) There are some simpler solutions, that have worked for some people. (Lucky them.) They haven't worked for me yet. I haven't even succesfully gotten the game to work yet. I shouldn't have to spend this amount of time to get it to work though. Especially when I paid for the game. This will stay a ""NOT RECCOMENDED"" review, until someone fixes this bug. Which I HIGHLY DOUBT will happen, since this game is flat out too old to be worth their time to fix it. It's a bummer this bug is here. Because it is preventing people from enjoying this game.EDIT: I fixed the resolution issue... but the .dll modification I had to make, doesn't allow for any AA. Which is total bullcrap in my opinion. 1920x1080 is an incredibly common resolution. The game dev's should have made this game fully functional with it, before release.			"

												Bought this during the recent sale (May 2015), and definitely cannot reccomend. Game has been abandoned by the developers, had horrible crackling audio (fixed via lowering sound card freq settings to ancient standards),  and it won't run above 720p (at horrible frame rates even so).I'm just so tired of buying an older game on Steam just to find it's broken and I've wasted my money. Vote with your wallets, and avoid this one.			"

												This game is the definition of mediocre. It's like if you took the most frustrating moments you have in Saints Row 4 and made the entire game out of it.The soundtrack is forgettable, the graphics are very bland (you'd think the blood and gore would be more vibrant), the gameplay is repetitive. A lot of the upgrades on your powers, and your powers in general, are useless when you either A. get a better power or B. find out that the best course of action in every scenario is to use the military weapons.I think that's what ultimately killed this game for me: you have such a variety of moves and powers to use, but in the end it's best to keep it very simple and straightforward.And one more thing: nobody in this game will ever SHUT UP. I was uninterested in the story as it was, but I had to go and mute the dialogue completely to stand the rest of this game. It would still make the master volume quieter when someone was supposed to talk, which was incredibly annoying too, but it also made me think to myself over and over ""Why would anyone be speaking right now?""

												Playing Prototype was a red haze. The games protagonist Alex Mercer is an unrepentant sociopath and embodies the Prototype worldview. Mercers obsession with vengeance leads him into mass murder, which in turn makes it impossible to root for him. He actually uses civilians as ""medi kits"", absorbing their bodies to replenish health. One of the primary quest givers is Mercers sister, and not killing her seems to be Mercers most humane act.  In fiction, the most obvious way to justify the anti-hero's acts is to make the villains even more evil in comparison. Prototype is not afraid of the obvious, and the military and the private sector seem to be psychopaths to the last man. The gameplay is OK but unspectacular, with Mercer having access to various powers but gaining upgrades at a very fast speed indeed. The speed of Mercers movements is very fast too, and going from place to place is actually well made. The typical activities (obstacle courses, kill challenges etc.) do not fit the game, at all. Prototype is nasty and nihilistic and I cannot recommend it to anyone. Prototype fans were somewhat disappointed when Mercer returned as the primary villain in 2, but that is what he was all along.

												I don't know what the big fuss is about; I do not like this game. I realized very quickly that this game is just a rehash of that old open-world Spiderman game. They just replaced Spiderman with Alex. Not to mention that I feel extremely overpowered and I am not that good at video games for the most part (50+ hours spend only on the first level of Demon Souls before I switched to PC). There's also the fact that the cut scene audio clips and cuts out constantly even when I turn down the settings. I bought Prototype and Prototype 2 and now I am out $20 because I am most likely not going to ever play them again.			"

												Prototype Pros and Cons-------------------------Pros- stealth and some creative ideas like patsy and consuming people to gain upgrades and fun to run up wallsCons-Frame rate dips constantly to single digits from 20-30, story is confusing and badly told; to many powers moves give wired button layout. Collectable will not show up till you get close and no way to track them, city layout is boring and really poor dialogue; Alex in cut scene sounds like an everyman that got a short deal, but then goes and kills hundreds of people, gameplay-combat gets frustrating and traversal gets boring, auto lock-on is not helpful "

												Boring and repetitive gameplay. Twitchy camera that loves to jerky around, making it tough to  track your targets. Weird sound bugs that cut in and out during the ""story"" segments, which mean you can't understand what's being said; very annoying. I completed the game, so my total is about it for length, unless you want to do all the side missions, which are even more boring and repetitive then the main story; add a few more hours if you do.  Combat is fun for a bit, but the game loves to spawn stuff in the moment your back is turned, literally, which kind of makes it pointless after you shred your 10th helicopter in a row. The only way to end it is to fly away, where they lose interest in 10 seconds, after you killed 100s of their men. Also, the combat take a dive towards the end when you fight the super solders; QRTs every time you fight these guys, and if you miss it, it will really hurt. On top of everything else coming at you (there is ALOT), these guys really ruin the flow of the combat, only way to beat them beyond shoot/throwing stuff at them is the QFT; pretty bad in a game where free flow combat is the main draw. Additionally, weapon balance is poor, why use anything else after you get the sword? Yea, unless you looking for absolutely mindless slaughter, and can tolerate the camera, you should probably pass.			"

												I can't really comment on it fairly. For me it doesn't work without going at about 15fps. Which is odd considering I can max out crisis 3 on ultra setting without a hint of slowdown. I've tried getting it to work but no joy. So it will be relegated to never seen again. Apart from that, I remember it being pretty good on the xbox 360. Time has not been kind and it hasn't been updated. Highest res is limited and as I side it was choppy choppy choppy. I cannot really recommend it, but remember it might just be down to my crapness with making software work.I am just one of those types that likes it to work without needing me to hunt through forums and get in touch with long lost relatives.

												Bought this game during this year's SSS, completely worth it (IMO)I read the reviews before buying and saw a few saying it isn't compatible with Windows 10 and that the game isn't the best on PC, so I was biased on buying it, but I did anyway, and I regret absolutley nothing.I've played roughly 16-18 hours of it on PS4 and I think I'll be close enough on the PC*Actual review time*I absolutley adore this game's gameplay (Way more than Prototype 2's gameplay) and characters (specifically Alex Mercer), but the PC version still has some problems that bug me specifically (and the game itself)Yes, I know the game was released in 2007, but I mean, they could've made the graphics at least A BIT better. I mean, after all, CoD4 for was out the same year, and the graphics on it are amazing (again, IMO), but the game itself runs amazing on my PC, so that makes up for it.Now, the actual game...Personally, I've never been interested in the main story of games (with a few exceptions), but the story for this game could've been alot better (not that it's bad, it actually is pretty decent)Pros:+Decent story+Way better gameplay than Prototype 2's gameplay (Once again, IMO)+Characters are interesting and make you want to know way more about them (especially Alex Mercer)Cons:-Story could be better-The graphics could/could've improved-Controls are....ehOverall, it's basically Hard-core Kirby, so it's a 9/10 from me "

												At launch you already needed third party fixes to make game playable, now few years later they still haven't fixed it, talk about lazy developers, so disrespectfull, you pay them money and don't even bother to fix the game even after so many years, don't buy without doing research on issues to make sure you can fix them on your own, if you cannot fix it on your own then don't bother at all.

												Prototype is a really good open world PS2 game. Yes, it was built for newer consoles, and on PC it should look even better, but for some reason it just feels like it's a Playstation 2 quality game. Every task feels samey, the enemies are boring, and the acting feels like it did before anybody with any decent acting ability would voice characters in a game. I find it impossible to care about anything that happens.Despite all that, if this game actually had come out for the PS2, or for the PC at the same time as, say, Star Wars Battlefront, it would have been amazing. I would have loved it, and I would have played it for hours on end. Now, however, it's just filled with that sense of disappointment you get when you go to play a game from your childhood that you loved (GTA3, for example) and it's just terrible by today's standards. For a better super-jumping, punch-exploding open-world experience pick up Saints Row IV when it's on sale. It's better on every possible level, unless your only deciding factor is whether or not a game has zombies.			"

												I liked playing this game until I discovered how repetitive the missions were.  That was the first issue, but I decided to cut it a little slack since it’s a slightly older game now.Then I found that you won’t learn the entire story unless you hunt down specific people running around throughout the city.  This irritated me and I wound up using a guide to find them all.On top of that, unless you complete a whole lot of side missions, there is no way you’ll ever come close to upgrading all of your powers.Halfway through this game, I felt like I just wanted it to be over with so I could move on and play Prototype 2.  FYI, I finish that game before I wrote this review and I found P2 much better than this one and you don’t really need to play P1 to understand the plot in P2.My biggest issue in this game was how frustrating combat is.  You are supposed to be able to dodge roll, but I could never get that move to execute, and then when I died, the death screen you give me the “tip” that I should dodge roll…  Then there are the creatures that start smacking you around, chain stunning you, from one creature to the next.  And finally, I don’t know how many times I was running around in combat, trying to swing at something, and instead I do a flying kick in a different direction.  Again, P2 is better because it fixed this with the ability to counter and dodge.Rating  4/10I would not recommend this game unless it was heavily discounted.  Instead get P2. "

												The visual engines of both Prototype games behave in a strange manner:1. They need to run at 60 frames per second on 60 Hertz to have smooth motion, were it not for the insane amounts of stuttering. This stuttering looks very much like an extremely severe case of microstutter, yet I only run a single GPU setup (1 x GTX 780 TI).2. Running the games beyond 60 fps (either through disabling the vsync or running at higher Hz) make them look like a 30 fps game. It looks like the engine repeats every frame even though any framerate counter will state that the games run smoothly at any Hz rate the monitor is set. (eg. 100 fps on a 100 Hz display, but it looks exactly like running a constant 50 fps on 100 Hz.)Both engine faults give me a headache when I try to play the games.I've tried every ""fix"" I could find on the internet (including disabling all HID devices, running at the lowest in-game graphics settings, adding command line parameters, setting processor affinity, using the resolution fix .dll, etc.) and none worked for me.So I know this isn't much of a review of the game itself. It might be good, but I never got to experience it myself because of these technical issues which I admit being sensitive to. Therefore, I can hardly recommend the game, now can I? I did, after all, not have a fun time playing this game.As such I feel I need to not recommend it. You might not have issues with it however, so keep that in mind. Yet, I still wanted to write these words of warning to those few people who might have issues with this game if smooth motion is kind of a must for them, or to those who loathe bad PC ports in general.

												I was pretty excited about it based on reviews and what I heard from friends, and the intro section was a lot of fun, where it gives you all sorts of ridiculous abilities and lets you just run around destroying things for half an hour to learn how the game works. Unfortunately, immediately after that it takes away every single one of your fun toys and makes you start over with absolutely nothing. ""Here, go play a completely different game that isn't any fun at all instead for several hours and earn the right to have fun again,"" it says. I slowly started unlocking some of the neat things I'd enjoyed playing with in the tutorial, and it got a bit better, but it was too little too slowly, and I got bored five hours in before it was able to recapture that initial excitement.For random comparison's sake, it feels a lot like a single-player version of DCUO to me, only with  tighter controls and a much less interesting, less colorful world, with a fairly bland story and unlikable characters. The gameplay probably would've been enough to save it if it hadn't completely turned me off by taking away all my fun I was having.			"

												I equate this game to herding a bunch of sheep into a very small corral and then squishing them all at once with a giant hammer.  That may sound weird but its the way it is.  This game story makes no sense and all of the npc civilians just wander around waiting to be mass squished.  They dont even react to whats happening in their environment in any logical way(I mean, at least sheep would try to run away in real life).  Anyway, on metacritic I notice its mostly young guys who give this game high marks.  Guys who get a kick out of squishing mass quantities of npcs for no particular reason.  If thats what you're looking for then buy this game!  If you prefer a story behind your squishing, or a story with a hero you can relate to in some way, or ANYTHING else to go along with your squishing, DONT buy this game.  You wont be happy.  Gameplay is fun for about the first hour and then you realize you are doing the same thing over and over and over and none of it makes sense.			"

												The good thing of Prototype is that you are a superhuman that can destroy/slice/throw everything you see but that is pretty much it. Graphic aged badly, the combos available are too much in number and it's easy to screw up when you need to use a specific attack, the autoaim is slow and if you don't use it it's easy to dash in the wrong way but the worst thing is the story. It's undeveloped, told in a messed up way and full of plot holes, easily the worst I ever seen in an action game and one of the worst ever. Even for 5€ you may don't want this game...			"

												Was a terrible game, you basically start off as your end game there is no feelinging of progression or accomplishment. Story is very linear and boring. For a game made back in 2009 it looks like it was made in the year 2006. You can more or less completely obliterate anything that is an enemy and makes it feel WAAAY to easy you can't even play on the more difficult settings until you've completed the game once. So it's a peace of cake until you've played it at least 3 times through which makes it more boring then the previous 2/3 times you've already played it... In conclusion don't buy this game go buy something better save your money just don't buy this game. "

												At least they got the name of the game right! This is just a Prototype, you start the game and it plays a intro movie and thats it you can move or do anything its not even a game in its current state its a bunch of bull. How does this have some many good reviews when you can't even play it? I really think the other reviews are fake to trick people into buying the game its a big scam and i am feed up! I talked with brother who took a law class in High School and he said it was ""BullSh!t"" so if hopefully this will change your mind. The intro movie is still really cool i just wanted to play something and not watch something so i will give it a 9 out 10 but still not recommend because it isnt a game.			"

												This game was a mess. The controls were really touchy and the lockon system was completely counter-intuitive and made it almost impossible to lockon the the target you really wantedmaking it feel like you pushed the buttons first then crossed your fingers and hoped your character moved the right way.  The main character's powers were mediocre when used in battle, it was better to just steal enemy weapons and vehicles to fight with giving the feeling that his powers were more why he was hunted than what made him cool. The characters were unrelatable and the story , while it had a good premise, felt poorly executed.  Add on that a half-dozen of the side quests were broken in an amazingly frustrating fashion and I have to say I'm suprised I finished the game at all.			"

												if you have played the second game then you will appreciate what this was trying to be, but wasn't.The main problem is the ""double tap"" to initiate free running which somehow just doesn't perform as it should, and given that you need to move fast when the helicopters descend, it just raises the anger level.I also found that the character would lose punch ability and a restart was needed to regain  it and also sometimes the ""exit vehicle"" option didn't seem to work.The second game is a classic but the first is not really worth the money, even if you want tpo see where it all started.

The pros : The gameplay is seriously amazing, even if surreal. The open world is really nice. The possibility to absorb everybody is kinda cool too. The cons : The storyline is boring. The militaries are such noobs it's amazing they are still in the army. The final boss is not reachable (see my first paragraph). You cannot possibly love the main character (you do however can like the other characters, it's not a problem).  The dialogues are soooo basic.What is not a pro nor a con : You can kill everybody if you like. The violence really graphic and clear in the game. Not really safe for work.			"

												Looking at this game, you're probably wondering...""Should I buy [Prototype]?"". It depends. Prototype is a basically the definition of a murder simulator. All you do in this game is kill and attempt to hide.The AI is crap, the locations are meh, you see the same civilian about a billion times in the same area you are in, the missions have barely any variety (other than kill more people and run up a building) and Alex Mercer is so emo its not even funny. So should you get this game? The only thing [Prototype] has that GTA, Saint's Row, and Just Cause don't have is extreme gore and constant killing in grotesque ways. If you want something with a bit more depth than that, I would advise you to look somewhere else. Otherwise, welcome to New York, Mr. Mercer.Verdict: PASS			"

												I had this game on the PlayStation3 and it was kinda enjoyable. Ripping and tearing apart innocent citizens and soldiers alike, destroying everything, ellbow-slamming a tank - there will be gore and explosions everywhere. Sounds decent, right?A little.Only problem is the controls where a bit clunky (even on the PS3) and I had massive problems focussing and attacking the enemy I actually wanted. Another funbreaker is the fact that you're easily being bounced back, even by small and weak enemies. It's even worse when stronger enemies and helicopters chase you. Sometimes you're feeling like a ball in a pinball machine.This game has so much potential and with proper implementation this propably would have been the best anti-aggression-game and there is. I mean, you have all those amazing powers! From disguise to running at super speed to hammerfists (lets you smash tanks), clawhands (rips and tears everything apart), whiplash (for taking down distant enemies), superjumping, semi-flying (gliding). You can even throw buses into helicopters and stuff, the list goes on and it's awesome.But you're almost not able to live it up.The story is ok and acceptable. The missions are way too hard and not fun at all (I'm not a good gamer, though). In one mission you have to flee. Excuse me? I'm a godlike creature and can destroy a tank with a single blow with my ellbow, why the heck should I flee?That's boring and uninspiring. It's like getting a Lamborghini in a racing game and the game tells you to drive not faster than 30 miles per hour. Unfortunately, I didn't find any cheats or mods for this game. I think with a little effort like removing all the time based missions and the bouncing this would be just awesome.If you can get this game for a decent price (it's under 10 dollars mostly, on Humble Bundle even cheaper) and if you do like gore, GO GET IT and happy ripping and tearing bodies apart for a while.  I really hope you could do an devastator attack on some people out there who are wasting so much potential. It hurts, especially as a creative person.			"

												The story is uninspired and the main character is as bland as stale toast. The camera and the targetting are on the same stick so you will constantly find yourself in situations where you have to choose between panning the camera or getting a lock on something - only to have that target switch to yet another unlabeled target whether you have line of sight or not. You'll be ragdolled out of maneuvers constantly. This includes ""consuming"" people to restore your health. This means you'll grab someone, start to eat them and have the animation interrupted by one of the dozen (at least) incoming attacks. Maybe it's a bulky melee hunter, maybe it's splash damage from the thirty-five missles and tank rounds, doesn't matter. Trying to restore health anywhere near an active battle (and the battle will follow you around corners, onto rooftops, and also see through your disguise instantly once the Super Soldiers enter the fight) is literally setting yourself up to be mauled. I'm lead to believe the studio that created this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥went out of business. With the design decisions they made here I have to say everyone who plays videogames is better off.			"

												Let me start off by saying that the concept of this game is amazing.  Who doesn't dream of having super powers?  Being able to run, jump, and glide across city blocks in the blink of an eye is quite the rush.  On top of that, being able to shapeshift at will (as a disguise or to transform your body into devestating weaponry).The problem for me is after about 10 hours of playtime, why am I struggling to find the will to continue playing?There's a story, but it feels like a narrative that I'm unlocking rather than experiencing.  It's completly mission-based.  The game quickly turns into a free-roam-the-city-to-start-x-event.  To become more powerful I destroy and kill everything.  To complete missions I destroy and kill.  To learn more about the story... destroy and kill.  Let me put it another way... you get reports on how many kills you get and how much money you cost the military, and the higher these numbers are the better your score is.I could really only reccomend this game to people who:a.

												Prototype has its ups and downs, but more downs that ups.  The main character has some super fun super powers that allow you to do some really crazy things as you fly, jump, or run (horizontally and vertically) through the city.The game also looks pretty good.  The story seems really fascinating as well, but that's about where the good ends.     First off, the city gets pretty boring pretty quickly as there is nothing really unique about the city that makes any part of the city look any different from another part.  I found myself just following the quest markers on the mini map and not trying to learn the city at all.  I never knew where I was unless I pulled up the main map.  There are lots of cool powers, but when the fights get going you are so busy running around trying to stay alive and kill that you never really get any time to really bask in the fun of watching a cool ability when it is triggered.     The main negative is that it appears that the controls for the PC port didn't translate properly.  The keyboard presses are super sensitive.  I've been using this keyboard for a few years and dozens of games, so I am comfortable with it, but I never had such problems with the keyboard in any other game than I did with Prototype.  To top it off there was no sweetspot for mouse sensitivity either.  Either it took HUGE hand sweeps to turn left and right, with the mouse, or my camera would go sitr crazy at the slightest twitch when trying to adjust the sensitivity.  Also y-axis sensitivity was way more sensitive than the x-axis.       As a result, I could barely control my character as I bounced off walls, hitting things, or attacking things except the actual mob I had selected as my target.  My character looked cool going bat crap crazy all over the fight zone, but if this game had been real life, the people I was fighting would have thought I was an idiot as they easily gunned me down, which is what happened during game play very often.  I eventually got so ultra♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at the lack of character control that I finally quit and removed the game from my system.  Experiencing the story wasn't enough of a draw to make me spend many frustrating hours getting killed constantly and wander through a boring city.  I'll read the story on Wikipedia or something.			"

												I really want to like this game, but can't. The idea is great and your ""super powers"" are awesome and so fun to use. But the difficulty level is all over the place, some missions are extremely simple while others are extremely hard. And the combat... Everytime you take a hit you get stunned for a while, so you often find yourself taking a chain of hits which you can't do anything about. It makes some missions extremely frustrating.Try Saints Row 4 instead. It has taken the super powers from Prototype but removed the frustrating parts of the gameplay.			"

The game would boot up at the wrong resolution, being a tiny box in the corner of my screen, with no way to make it fit despite my fiddling with the resolutions. So many things wrong with this game, I can't possibly type it all unless you want a  page-long review. it runs SLOWWWWWW and just basically unplayable. Terrible purchase choice.

												I managed to get half-way through PROTOTYPE and ended up writing over my save file in an act of confusion, all because the developers made one of the worst PC ports I've ever played. There's no chance I'll be playing through all of this again anytime soon.Here's the main issues I had with what would be an otherwise fun and enjoyable game:• Shadows are completely nonexistent for those who have AMD graphic cards.• It's impossible to continue without having the game crash. In order to fix this you need to start a new game with a new save, quit back to the main menu after the first cutscene, and then load your original save file. This is where I got confused, after not playing for so long, and managed to save over my old file.• The volume in this game is extremely low. I play with headphones, for almost every game I'll usually set the volume to around 40% through the little controller on my headset. I find it hard to hear at 100% with PROTOTYPE, there's no other way to increase the volume.There are no fixes for these issues, there's no FOV slider which would help with how claustrophobic the screen is. The developer went bankrupt and no one gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the people who bought this in such a broken state, so I insist you not waste your time and money or you'll only end up as frustrated as I am right now.

												Buy Prototype 2 instead.  The original is a terrible game - as the game progresses, they use more and more cheap methods to prevent you from getting your attacks off - interrupt upon interrupt upon interrupt.  Your targeting seems to target the WORST possible targets, no matter what weapon you use.  Again, this happens more and more as the game progresses.  This game sucks.  Prototype 2 on the other hand, is a fantastic game.Don't buy this stinker.  Save your money, and use it to buy Prototype 2.			"

												Don't buy this. Lots of consolitis in this one. A camera that wants to do its own thing and frequent slow character animations that take you out of the gameplay. Third-person platforming. Enemy AI is terrible, and enemies just spawn around you rather than following a sensible path through the city. There is no persistence to the game world, making the missions to clean up the city completely pointless. The missions themselves are repetitive. Ends in a frustrating final boss fight,			"

												Would be a decent game if the bosses weren't ridiculously overpowered, the game has many bugs one being that it crashes A LOT. Meaning you have to restart A LOT of missions because you can't save during them.I appreciate it's an old game but come on, it can't be this bloody awful.			"

												Boy oh boy does this game♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.I'll start with what limited positives there are.The game is very open world and its fun to explore the city. With plenty of buildings to jump off of and obliterate the civilians below.If you get bored of 'gliding' arround you can nab a helecoptor and actually fly around and blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up.If you get bored of sprinting, hop in a tank.The gameplay is uneque (well kinda, saints row 4 kinda borrowed some elements of this game later on, so its a little less uneque now.) You have an array of powers at your desposal and you can ingest old people, what more do you want??Thats it. no more good points.The graphics look.. alright I guess. The mane protagonist makes oblivian look photo realistic.The ai is wonky? from what I have seen they sot of spazz a bit? if you do a little jump, every one screams and runs off. EXURSIZE ISNT THAT SCARY! if you murder some one in a crowd, only 2 or 3 people will scream? Is America actually like this or?The enimies... all I can say is stun lock. everything you do can and will be canceled out. wanna attack? stun lock. wanna heal? stun lock. wanna run off? stun lock. This method alone has killed me more times than anything elce. I am currently on the final boss fight and guess what, as soon as the intro for the boss finished. Stun locked to death. wanna use a devistator attack? Well ♥♥♥♥ you cause your gonna get hit by some random thing you didn't see. Why does sothething that can save you live take a full 3-4 seconds to do? There is no point in having it. Its like saying ""you have the cure for canser but in order to cure your self, you have to die of cancer."" Its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I know you can spam the attack if there isnt a delay, but it isnt even that op. you can spam it after any way, just eat a couple people. what is the point in having it, if it takes so long to do, and it can be canceled out but some random civilian taking a cheep shot? SLAPS AREN'T THAT HARD!Your attacks feel less than super human. even upgraded. they barly do damage against the bigger enimies and thats if you can actually land any of your hits. The game discuises this by giving you 'different' abilities to 'mix' togeather to do 'devistating damage'. Devistating lossly translates to in this game as; a teeny bit more damage than befor. at no point in this game did I feel super human, strong, or remotly dangerous. If anything, the people running arround were more thretaning that you are in this game.The sprinting in the game feels like a non-shalont jog and is hard to controll. Jumping doesn't seem all that good either, it doesn't feel as strong when you jump up buildings or jump from building to building as it does when you just stand still and jump. The gliding might as well not be there at all. 2 seconds of horisontal movement then its a plumit back to earth. you can dash in mid air, but even that feels half harted and doesn't always push you farward. The movement feels extreamly sluggish. I have seen more movement in stephen hawking than Mr mercer.sprinting and climbing up buildings can be an♥♥♥♥♥to deal with. So any time have I been sprinting up somehitng for mr mercer to fling himself off for no reason. So after this happens a few times, I decided to sprint round buildings. Nope, just as annoying. Mr mercer decides to jump on buildings willy nilly, flip around and be un helpful in general. The pre alphaa parkor of assassins creed would get you round faster and more efficiantly.The plot is meh... Virus.. you want to stop the virus, ohhh but then you don't.. ohh then ""drama"". About half way thrugh the game *SPOILERS* your sister gets kidnaped by a massive brute like enimy. I couldn't give two flying ♥♥♥♥s. I was only told that she was ""my"" sister, no other relationship building at all. She is only there to tell you information to further the plot. I really didn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥when she got kidnapped at all.Oh, and, I musn't forget to say this. There are escort/protect missions. YAY -_- the game gives you someting to protect, then flings 6 brutes at it at one time, so you have one of three options.1. attack the brutes head on, get stun locked by them, explotions and everything elce then die.2.nab a helecoptor that looses the 1000% acuracy that the NPC's get when they fly it, and shoot at the brutes that way. (Oh and you do damage to the thing you are supposed to protect so you aren't furthering your own cause here.)2.Pinch a tank, and to the same as the helli but with a little more acuracy and you are on the ground. If you go for option 2, good luck with that. See in order to actually get in a helli, you gotta launch yourself at it and press 'E' (for the PC of cource.)((and this is if you can find a hellin on the floor nicely wating for you)) but even if you hit the helli and press the aformantioned 'E' button, 75% of the time nothing will happen. So have fun jumping arround whilst the thing you are supposed to protect is taking 15% damage every 2 seconds.All in all the game is meh.... or even less than that. If you want to get this game, get it on sale. (I normally say cause everything is great on sale, but seriously, it isnt worth £15.)-11/10 would get stun locked so much that I have to pay for a neew monitor and apologise to my gf cause I got so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off the HULK ain't got nothing on this again.

												Great game, tons of fun when I played it a long time ago on a rig with Windows Vista. But if you have Windows 7 or later, forget about this game because it will be nothing but god awful trouble getting it to run, which is why I voted to not recommend it. If you do, have a xbox 360 controller to play this because if you use a mouse and keyboard it stutters horribly. If you have Win7 or higher, go for Prototype 2. And use a wired xbox 360 controller for that too because using keyboard and mouse also causes stuttering in that game as well.			"

												Welcome to Manhattan Island, New York. Your name, Alex Mercer,  protagonist.  Roaming the city with a fractured memory, he finds himself not quite what he used to be. Infected with an unknown virus and hunted by the Marines & an insidious Lab called Gentek Alex must survive in order to learn what happened to him. As he progresses throughout the infected city, he learns that the pathogen quickly assimilates every living cell in the human body, even the clothes he wears which makes him virtually the perfect shape shifter. He tracks down his sister &s an old girlfriend who helps him along the way only to find out he does not like what he remembers. In this game you’ll be able to disguise yourself and infiltrate Top Secret Military bases, gain control of Massively Armored Thermobaric Tanks & Fully Weaponized Air Gunships like the AH-64D Apache. Customize Melee/Combo attacks, Upgrade weapons and body armor, this game a lot to offer.			"

												While I do love the detail put into the dismemberment and gore of this game, the story falls short and well, to be honest, some things feel weird.I know, I know... ""It's an old game."" But that's not an excuse for the cars to seat deformed polygonal people inside. Some little things like that broke the inmersion and overall experience for me in big ways.I'd say check out Saints Row 4. It's this game on steroids but add some personality, mature comedy and a slew of mini-games as well.This isn't a terribly bad game, there's just better alternatives that are now available on the Steam market and well, this isn't worth the asking price. A fair price for this game would be 25% of what they are asking for.			"

												I honestly believe Radical Entertainment though up this game, went around to other developer studios learning what they did wrong and right in games in the past, took the 'right' pile, tossed it in the toilet and flushed it down, and started building the 'wrong' pile into some unholy altar.Seriously. EVERY... SINGLE... THING... in this game is a TEXTBOOK example of ""what NOT to do in video games"" that you'd get in a 101 class.Terrible controls. Terrible plot. Terrible music- maybe. Sound was INSANELY LOW compared to everything else on my computer- even when maxed. I literally had to TRIPLE the volume of my speakers to be able to hear it at a decent level. Terrible graphics. Terrible controls. Oh wait- I said that already. Well it's important to re-emphasize because the controls and mechanics made the game BORDERLINE unplayable. And I use that world with the utmost intention. If it had a SINGLE thing worse with it's controls- it would have been straight up unplayable. The game until a certain point was so easy it was impossible to enjoy. Then after that point they cranked the meter up to 11 to the point it was entirely unfair. Permanent stunlocks. ONE HIT KOs that you CANNOT avoid.NEVER. EVER. EEEEEVER... buy this game. EVER.I got this game at 75% off on a sale. I feel like walking up to the developers studio and demanding that 25% I paid back as a refund, then the 75% I didn't added on to compensate for my pain and suffering. This game was THAT bad. I've only ever quit one other game in my entire LIFE- witcher 2. And that was because it was LITERALLY unplayable due to issues with the port to PC. At least I knew within the first 3 minutes of witcher 2 that it was going to be nothing but pain and suffering and I didn't actually suffer through the ENTIRE thing.I played through the game start to finish (as quickly as humanly possible...) so no one can say I didn't give it a chance. It had it's chance 100 times over as far as I'm concerned. I am unfortunate enough to have bought prototype 2 at the same time as part of the franchise pack when the game was on sale. Needless to say- I will not be installing that any time soon.			"

												Prototype is an action-adventure open world game.You are Alex Mercer, a man without memory armed with amazing superhuman powers and the option to go most anywhere you like and do most anything you want once you get there.A virus outbreak has claimed Manhattan, forcing the island into a military quarantine. The infected citizens turning the population into mutants.The main story path is entirely linear. The missions are a sloppy mix of poorly paced ideas. Long missions involve simply going from one end of Manhattan to the other, while some of the short missions are climactic sieges and battles. Missions can be brutally challenging, often because of the uncooperative auto-lock system. Boss battles are much longer than they need to be and more often test your endurance rather than your skill.As you work your way through the game, you will earn experience points that can be used to unlock new and ever more exotic powers. Experience points are also the only thing you get by finding collectibles.The graphics are not the best, buildings and environments are ugly, so the world is not a place you want to explore. All in all, the awful boring and repeating missions and linear gameplay ruins the overall experience.Sounds 5/10Graphics 5/10Gameplay 6/10Atmosphere 5/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												i was told this game was similar to the infamous series and while they werent wrong, it feels like activision just played infamous and tried to make a knockoff version of it. both games were made during the same year and yet prototype feels cheap and lazy with the graphics of something id expect to see on a much older console. There's no atmosphere and the main character is very two demensional with the sole goal to kill everyone that experimented on him.			"

												This game sucks.Want an in-depth review why this game sucks?  I found the sound messed up really hard so I could barely hear the dialogue when there was any.  It didn't stop me from understanding the story, but it did♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.  The story is boring.  It's a typical amnesiac with super powers trying to figure out the past.  I liked it better when it was the Bourn Identity.Gameplay started out funny but immediately got stale.  I really don't care for stealth missions and I didn't see a need for them in this game, but it went ahead & gave me stealth missions anyway.  The whole thing felt poorly balanced.  You're this super ultra killing machine and there's always a seemingly infinite number of soldiers on the screen all spread out shooting at you at all times and you're trying to kill enough guys to keep regenerating health.  Then they introduce these mutant alien things that take for god damn ever to kill.  I got really tired of fighting those things after about the 28th time.You can steal vehicles, but it wasn't really adding anything to the gameplay.  About 8 or so missions in, I just got bored of the game and decided this wasn't worth finishing.  I was on normal and I started out laughing like ""hahaha this is so easy"" to having a heart attack trying to finish a mission.  I get that there were more super powers to upgrade, they seemed mostly useless from the description.  The novelty of the game wears off after about half an hour or so.  It just didn't seem like it was worth finishing.			"

												I remember this was my 2nd game for my PS3 that i have had when i first got it and boy did i enjoy this game. This game has a very touching story and the combat system is very good. The soundtrack keeps the tense in the battle very nicely. And this game is very good for whenever you are bored. When I do not have any games to play I just sit down to play good ol' Prototype and start destroying military bases and disembering people. This is rare for me to say but it is one of the best games that i have played in my life and it deserves a 10/10			"

												If you are an Infamous fan, this is a really good pickup.  There are many similarities between Infamous and Prototype that made me feel like I was back in Empire City (at times).  The overall feel of the game is a lot like Infamous.  While the storyline is a little less intriguing, the free play in a lot more enjoyable, something you and a friend can do for fun for a long time.			"

												Hey, very good game for this price (5 €) ! The first hours of discover are so pleasurable. It's a little bit repetitive once you understand the mechanics, yet graphics/sounds/musics are very good and the scenario is exciting. You have full liberty in the way you advance in the story. There's a lot of side missions available beside main ones. The whole city of New-York is modeled and you can find missions everywhere in there. You can spend a lot of time before getting bored, but ... some could get bored before finishing the main scenario. A little bit repetitive I told you ;)Whatever, for the actual price, it's a must have. I may not have been recommanding this at 60€/$80, but at 5 €, there's absolutely no reason not to jump on it very fast.			"

												This is only a first impression, but from what I have played, this game is what you get if you take the concept of Kirby and suck every last ounce of innocence out of it. Not to mention adding a whole lot of bloody mess rather then clean 'inhaling' as it were. Its -kinda- typical third persion actiony title, but the fact that you're a Parkour People Eater (My offical term for Alex Mercer) gives it that different edge that keeps it interesting. The fact you can be jumping from rooftop to rooftop one moment, to sneaking past security by eating someone with the right clearence the next, and then hacking your way through horrible monstrosities with your giant claw arms after that keeps the game interesting and enjoyable.

												This game....is one of the few AAA titles that rolled out in its time that was not only difficult (to a degree), but wasn't awful.   Sometimes I still install and play me a little bit of Prototype.  Unfortunately, the IP has been cancelled for all further sequels; Prototype 2 was barely able to release, as this decision occurred before Prototype 2 went for sale. Prototype 2 is a nice conclusion and I suggest picking up both games.    This one, however, has you as Alex Mercer, and as you go through the plot, you find you can ""play the villain"" recklessly and enjoyably to kick off your after work stress.			"

												  To start, the port of the game is acceptable. The game's highest resolution setting is 720p, and the graphics certainly aren't very impressive for a 2009 PC game. InFAMOUS looks better on PS3 really, and it came out at the exact same time. I played this game with a controller, so I can not tell you if the mouse and keyboard controls work well. The controls with a controller are alright. They aren't as precise as I'd like, but their good enough to keep the gameplay enjoyable. I experienced a couple crashes, but the game was fairly stable overall.  The gameplay is better than the port and is a nice bit of mindless fun. You can slice, throw, crush, and consume people by the dozen. The homicidal maniac within the player will have a blast butchering helpless soldiers for quite a while. However, eventually your inner homicidal maniac will realize there's nothing else to do but kill kill kill, and he or she will begin to grow tired of the indiscriminate mass murder. You'll probably reach this point before you finish the game, especially after half the enemies become super soldiers, large mutants, tanks, and various other enemies that will knock you about stunning you constantly and throwing you around like a baseball among a group of American children. Getting around the city is quite enjoyable. There's just something satisfying about jumping 50 feet into the air and gliding around New York, but this also begins getting old with time.   The story is forgetable, but if you're buying a game where you play as a superpowered mass murderer for story, then you're clearly looking in the wrong place.  This game fills a good few hours with hack and slash joy, but outstays its welcome. I'd recommend you get it on sale.			"

												This is only a first impression, but from what I have played, this game is what you get if you take the concept of Kirby and suck every last ounce of innocence out of it. Not to mention adding a whole lot of bloody mess rather then clean 'inhaling' as it were. Its -kinda- typical third persion actiony title, but the fact that you're a Parkour People Eater (My offical term for Alex Mercer) gives it that different edge that keeps it interesting. The fact you can be jumping from rooftop to rooftop one moment, to sneaking past security by eating someone with the right clearence the next, and then hacking your way through horrible monstrosities with your giant claw arms after that keeps the game interesting and enjoyable.

												one of the best open world games i have ver played aside from just cause 2.Your a god with the powers every human has ever wished in a massive open world new york city,Well at least thast what the box says,in reality your alex mercer a normal person abducted by genko as one of there test subjects and you gain powers that in my opinion are great but you do have to unlock evolution points to get most of the weapons/powers that you have.As you progress through the game Alex becomes more powerfull and does awesome moves,which isnt a bad thing but by that point your as they said on the box:a God so that is the only issue i have with this magnificent game overall,8/10.I would reccomend this to all gamers.

												This game....is one of the few AAA titles that rolled out in its time that was not only difficult (to a degree), but wasn't awful.   Sometimes I still install and play me a little bit of Prototype.  Unfortunately, the IP has been cancelled for all further sequels; Prototype 2 was barely able to release, as this decision occurred before Prototype 2 went for sale. Prototype 2 is a nice conclusion and I suggest picking up both games.    This one, however, has you as Alex Mercer, and as you go through the plot, you find you can ""play the villain"" recklessly and enjoyably to kick off your after work stress.			"

												Played the game, beat the game, what do I think?My Pros,Driving story, excellent open world motion, you wouldn't believe how fast you can hoof it from one end of the city to the other, and I love the feeling of being just plain unstoppable.  The game still had moments where I had to run, rethink, and try a new angle, so this isn't blind button mashing.  Some good challanges for practice, or just a break between missions is nice as well.My ConsI'm not a fan of the harsh language, i.e. get ready for a lot of military speak.  And the stealth parts feel a bit easy, especially with the stealth consume perk.  Thank goodness stealth is not what this game is about.  More like a little seasoning.My Overall feeling.Loved the game for that satisfying ""Unleash the Beast"" feeling.  Definite recommend.			"

While the storyline is a little less intriguing, the free play in a lot more enjoyable, something you and a friend can do for fun for a long time.			"

												Meh. So I got this game on sale and I guess it is worth it but proceed with caution. This game is hard as hell. It's also very repetitive. People who say this game is a GTA game on steroids, are very wrong. This game is nothing like GTA. Far from it actually. The games glitches are constant, the story is pathetic, and the gameplay has some getting used to. It's a fun game but only for the beat down part. The sandbox element is there but don't expect much from it. If you're playing for story, look else where. The story is stupid and the missions are sometimes so unbearable. Here's a run down of a typical missionGo to doctor*5 minutes laterDoctor wants to to kill♥♥♥♥♥♥for him *45 minutes later of contantly getting blown up by tanks and helicoptorsDoctor tells you he can't help you*MISSION COMPLETEDThat's a majority of the story and the game itself. So overall, this game is passable but if it's on sale, get it. You may find yourself enjoying it more than I do.			"

												Overall: not a bad game, but has many annoyances that will add up and impair your fun:-several sections of the game are just plain obnoxious (getting swarmed with enemies that knock you down every few seconds EACH)-due to above obnoxiousness, standard strategy is to /not/ use your mutant ability arsenal and instead steal a tank and fire from a safe distance.-Web of Intrigue is cool but no way to tell where targets are unless you are very nearby, so getting a full Web means running on foot through every street.-Abilities are interesting but only 2-3 'modes' are well developed-events are repetative and bland (kill x within y, time trials)-City is big and parkouring is fun, but its visually boring.-On the plus side, the stealth AI is hilariously inept. You can literally drive a tank down the streets, mowing over civillians and cars, and still be completely undetected.			"

												The chief theme here will be broad strokes, which is what Prototype has. It's got the framework of a bunch of cool stuff, and it works to an extent, but there's ample room for improvement in everything. Take for example, the movement. You can climb and jump around most anything, and going in a single direction feels awesome most of the time, you can glide and dash and leap to your heart's content. But, if you're trying to get a tricky collectable from atop an antenna or building, Alex will often tweak out and flip over and around everything in sight, and it's quite a job to wrestle him into precise movements. Want to turn left or right? Hope you've got a few seconds cause unstoppable forces don't turn on a dime. Another example: Do you hate collateral damage? Don't even, cause there is nothing you have that won't wipe out a 90 degree arc about 10 feet in front of you at least. You're going to be smashing civvies and other innocents all the time, and the game gives you a nice running total of how many families you've ruined after each fight, so good luck sleeping I guess.The actual in-game storyline is, nyeh? It's okay, it gives me an excuse to destroy all this junk, and it joins up all these events just fine. There were a couple of standout moments, but ultimately it was pretty by the numbers. It does tend to wrench control out of your hands to show you things during missions, or straight up transport you across the map afterwards, which can be annoying. The Web Of Intrigue though? That's some good stuff right there, loads of dropped hints and filling in the gaps, much speculation and other really cool junk. I spent ages just cruising the city looking for targets cause they were so interesting. Word of advice though, never skip a target movie, cause good luck remembering the name and then finding it in the hundred-something strong web.Combat: Losing relies chiefly on some very dubious things: Unavoidable chip damage, homing attacks, and super-damaging stunlocks. It's not that it's not challenging, cause you will die if you're not paying attention, but it's really going through the motions of action/reaction to the above three. Some cooped-in boss battles can make the game feel hard, and especially early in the game when you're not very powerful. Oftentimes you'll find yourself cheesing fights by staying on the move and chipping at stronger foes from range, because moving in for actual damage provides them with too many opportunities to stun/grab/hit you and it's not worth the risk. It makes fights more of a chore than fun sometimes, and that's not so great. Health is relatively easy to come by, by grabbing and eating mooks, but it makes every mistake another chore, since everything big hurts you so much you'll have to find and consume 2-3 of the little guys safely before you can re-engage. It skews the pacing and atmosphere of fights quite a bit, and it's often more advantageous to just bug out. Unless, of course, you're doing a scripted story mission or event that requires you to clear an area, in which case hunker down for the long haul. The AI isn't very smart, not at all, but they are numerous and widespread. It's not about outsmarting them, it's about outsmarting the group and learning to play the way they work to your advantage. Stealth isn't, really, but it does what it needs to and works within the larger framework. Many of the stronger enemies are niusances rather than challenges, but again you gain the powers to gib them or to lose them fairly early on, so it's not really too big of a deal.Speaking of powers, those are pretty cool. You get a bunch of different arms, some defensive stuff, some supports, and they all have a use. You'll probably find yourself favouring one or two though, since there's quite a bit of redundancy between them. I'd have liked to see some more differentiation, but only a small fraction are mandatory so I guess not having everything must be allowed for. There's lots of stuff to spend your money on, special moves for each power as well as ones for plain old fisticuffs, movement and health upgrades, super moves, the store really does overflow with stuff. The movement too, once you figure out how to do it right, it's a joy to traverse the city and the challenges become simple matters of route rather than speed. You can fly and dash and grab walls and leap and dive, there really are a lot of things you can do and that's great. Also, when you enter the power radial selection everything slows down for a second to let you pick, and that's awesome.While it's not perfect, Prototype has one excellent quality: Not many other games make you feel this powerful, this badass, all of the time. You have a couple of dozen ways to destroy the dude that's ineffectually pinging at you with his rifle, and you have so much health that you can afford to decide. If he brings ten friends, it still doesn't really matter cause you can just nab one and chuck him at the others and then elbow drop the rest before zipping up a building and being five blocks away before backup even thinks of arriving. If some tougher guys decide to chase you, you're stronger and faster than them so just hit them with a ventilation unit and disappear, because you can. It broaches on God Game territory sometimes, but you're running around on the ground being all-powerful, and that feels really good.+Fun as all hellOodles of powers and upgradesFeels godlike, manOptions, options, options-Poor PC controlsCombat can be cheap at timesShowing it's age graphicallyIn the end, Prototype was worth the time I put into it, and despite the above tirade, the good outweighs the bad. Much of it is just frustration about what could have been great but ended up being just good. But, that still leaves you with a good, fun game, with tons of things to do and stuff to see, and a lot of extra storyline junk for those interested.			"

												Okay this game is good now i say that as in its not bad, but could be better. And how they couldve improved on that is the story. Now the story to me its not quite clear what your main objective is because might i say Alex is a bit of a dumba$$ but we will forgive him,  buit not knowing exactly what your main goal is, is...just not quite right but its still okay and pretty interesting of course leaving out the part of alex being an idiot. But then there are the cutscenes, the cutscenes with alex in them makes them confusing, not complicated just confusing because alex has the IQ of a rock his dialog is......not on the inteligent side making it hard to follow the storyline now for JUST THE STORY i would give it like a 7 or a 7.5 strictly because of how dumb alex is. But at this point youd be like ew bad story i dont want to sit through that. Well learning the fact that after you beat one mission you get more bada$$ powers drives you to want to play the story more. So if you want this game buy it more in the idea of your going to run around and kill people with awseome powers and upgrades not in the aspect of the story that much. My opinion but had to point it out.			"

												This is the first superhero game to make me actually feel like I'm playing as a superhero.Well....maybe super HERO isn't the right word considering most of the game involves slaughtering as many innocent people as possible, consuming their bodies, and assuming their identities as you elbow-drop tanks off of skyscrapers and hijack helicopters with your tentacle arm.This is the first superperson game to make me actually feel like I'm playing as a superperson.Oh yeah, and it’s much better than inFamous.

												Insanely fun game, I love devouring people and becoming them aswell as upgrading and unlocking new powers its so badass, graphics arnt the best but I'm not bothered about it because as long as it runs I'm fine. I wanted to game a couple years ago when I watched theRadBrad (Youtuber) play it and now I finally got the chance to grab it myself and I love it. Literally the perfect game for me, the violence, open world, third person, a good varity of powers/abilities, shapeshifiting. Did I mention that you can throw people at helicopters and watch them explode.. no? I highly reccomend this game and would love to get Prototype 2 some day.(Wish it had windowed mode though. cri)			"

												BEFORE I REVIEW! If you are having FPS problems. Try this.1.) Open Device manager.2.) Start DISABLING, and not DELETING your HIDs. (Aka the ones that look like ""HID-compliant ~etc)3) Re-enable them after you stop playing. This fixed my issue. Hopefully it fixes yours, should you have it. <3Review:Pros:+ Combat is absolutely brillaint. + Gameplay feels smooth.+ Things despawn at a very slow rate. For example: You can set a helicopter down at one end of the map. Run to another end and back and find it right where you left it.+ You have character appropriate abilities.+ Violent, and gory. Very, very graphic. (If you enjoy gory games.)+ There's an option to replay the campaign with previous campaigns unlocks. <3Cons:- Graphics are a little dated. Max resolution is 1280/800.- Story is short, and a little lacking.- Entire game is essentially a copy of Radical's: ""The Incredible Hulk. Ultimate Destruction.""- Very gory, and violent. (If you dislike, or are disturbed by gore.)- Voice acting was bad. (Though better than the second game, I will mention.)- End game feels repetitive. You run around killing the same hunters, soldiers. Destroying the same bases, and hives. After you're fully upgraded. End game Prototype feels a lot like endgame GTA. You just run around and kill things.If you played the Hulk Game I mentioned in the Cons. Then realizing the fact that it was essentially copy pasted from that game will ruin most the experience for you. Though if it is on sale. I would pick it up.			"

												Bought this on sale and let it sit a year in my library before finally installing it. Sadly, I have the opening cinematic crash problem others in the forum have mentioned experiencing (game crashes to desktop upon starting a new game). Don't know the root cause (the game being six years old at the time of writing may be a factor, I'm sure), but for me at least the game is literally unplayable. Obviously. there's no patch ever coming. Pity! I was looking forward to finally sitting down with this game. Hoping for better luck with the sequel...			"

												Ok so I've grinded out Prototype on my laptop whilst on my holiday and I can say it is W-I-C-K-E-D. The open world is huge with events where you can take on the military or the infected- which you can complete whilst playing through the story or save for the end. Now this review is late- like several years late- I tuned into the prototype franchise only very recently as I saw that it being an older game- would run smoothly on my crummy laptop (@2.00 GHZ Intel i7 with Intel HD 4000) on the go. And after completing the campaign- all I can say is: 8 HOURS WELL SPENT!!!! The game, despite its unoriginal ""no memories- imma kill everyone and get revenge"" adds a delicious twist to the topic by giving our protagonist shapeshifting and disguise abilities that totally spin the game off in another direction I wasn't expecting. The story chases down Alex Mercer's Creators, all whilst mixing a powerful combat element with a more stealthy concept. There are only a few things that I noticed which should have been ironed out in development:-Civilian NPC variation: in some parts of the world I encountered mobs of civilians with identical skins O_O-Military Stupidity: When I disguised myself as a military commando and entered the bases, doing flips running at super speeds and stuff- all the military can say is ""Hmm.. We should check that out"" all whilst the suspiscion meter remained static.That's all I have to say. Recently a prototype 1 & 2 next gen bundle popped out on console and I have yet to crunch through James Heller's Story in Prototype 2. I bet it'll be a blast!!!!Final Verdict 8/10 "

The powers are so cool and the disgiuse ability is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing but the side missions are nothing special here besides the base infiltrations but even that can get kinda repetitive but its still a fun game to play. Boss fights are also cool and even fun to play. The web of intrigue is also cool and interesting. Once you start to get more powers you can start going crazy around the city. Story is also interesting but the missions can kinda get repetitive. Do not miss out on a game like this. If you like the idea of an anti hero and the fact that when you kill someone you have no consequences buy this game!			"

I highly recommend this game, it has so much content and fun sandbox features and if you're a fan of games like Saints Row, InFAMOUS or Just Cause were there is lots to do in the open world and just create havoc, destruction and just have fun in a large world of freedom, definitely buy this.

			Santa meets Eggzilla. SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/AdultSwimSubscribe About Aqua Teen Hunger: Aqua Teen Hunger Force is almost assuredly the first thing that you'd identify with Adult Swim.		

Pros:♥♥♥♥♥♥looks like Guyver+I loved John Carpenter's The Thing+Zombies+Immersive world+Side quests are rewarding+Meaty body giblets+Has a Story Mode+Cons:-Story can get confusing-Where is Dana?This is a fantastic biopunk game, which simply must be played. Of course, Activision's ""sterling"" reputation in previous years has been a warning for most of there games, but Prototype seems to be an exception. Although I played this game a whole SIX YEARS after its release, this is still a solid game. It deficiencies in quality graphics are more than made up by the ground breaking world design and ai for its time. What feels like a hundred different cars, zombies, soldiers, and civilians in an ever changing map runs very smoothly. Now this isn't much for the standard computer now, but just how all these actors interact is astounding. Cars will swerve away from zombies and have car crashes while helicopters swoop by over head and the distant gunfire of a soldier can be heard. When playing this game I couldn't help but get immersed.9/10 -It's like those really good spiderman games turned spiderman into The Thing, make him wear a leather jacket, and fight zombies. "

												I've played this game before I play Assasin's Creed or Batman series. So this is the game that makes me love third person, action genre. You play it as Alex Mercer, a ""Prototype"", a victim imo.I won't give any details or spoils but even after years, I remember most of the keypoints at the story, so its pretty solid.Also has nice graphics and performence for its release date, even that its dated still nothing really disturbs you. Additionally pretty good controls especially with an xbox controller.Some missions and events might be boring or feel like grinding, but generally its really a good mix between disguise and fighting in chaos by using your powers and hijacking vehicles.Grab it on sale if you have any doubts but you love the genre. You won't regret.			"

												Quite a interesting and different game compared to alot that I own on steam. If anyone has ever played any of the Infamous games and enjoyed them, you will like this, has a similar feel to while not being the same.  The Story is quite interesting where it starts out towards the end, and alot of the game is basically you playing flash backs (although most if not all game is during those ""flashbacks"") leading up to the ""beginning"", and the end of the story.  Even when not playing missions, there are side activities to do that will help you obtain upgrade and have fun. Outside of those, there is still sandbox style fun to have throughout the city. In some ways, progressing through the story makes the game more fun (upgrades, new/more enemies), but at the same time some makes it a little less fun (Hunters all over, military uses more heavy hardware, less neutral zones.). The only thing that I did not like about the game, was the difficulty of the final boss. Overall a good game though.			"

												I thought at first the powers thing was just another gimic that will get old quick and leave me with another bland gaming experience that I just want to get over with.  Out of curiousity I picked it up when it went on sale and was blown away.  I've never been so wrong about a game.  Sure the powers are an obvious and major aspect of the game, but there's lots of them and though they're a bit tricky to get used to, they're well worth it and fun to use.  The game is a good length and the story evolves.  There are other aspects to the game as well, consuming characters to get their memories and various skills-testing events.  Probably the biggest thing is the endless waves of infected you get to mow through.....absolutely priceless.BUY.....THIS.....GAME!			"

The main protagonist is a completely uncaring sociopath (think♥♥♥♥♥♥Cheney, but badass,) who thinks nothing of riding a tank through Central Park mowing down infected and any uninfected schlub that happens to get in the way. But he loves his sister, regardless (and probably is nice to his mother and randomly stops the carnage to pet puppies and kittens, or something.) In short, the perfect protagonist for an apocalypse.			"

												The game is pretty average. Graphics are not the highest quality and it has poor characterization and i never felt connected to characters throughout the game. However the weapon variety was fun and kept me playing. The open-world is also fun, running around destroying everything in sight is always fun. The storyline is pretty boring, but is a good length. Gameplay however is extremely fun and one of the reasons it was a good game. 7/10- great gameplay,♥♥♥♥♥♥storyline			"

												This game was... alot better then I expected! I'm usually not keen on the whole ""invincable killing machine"" but this one was really fun. The powers worked though I usually prefered to use military weapons over them usually but thats just my preference. Theres alot to do but its its not too impossable which I like. The story is ok but you really don't get very interested in the life of Alex Mercer. Still, I really enjoy the fact that there are so many cutscenes! I have never seen a game with so many mini cutscenes. So this game is loads of fun and I can't wait to play the next one! This is a must play!			"

												Prototype is the kind of game that shows how bad and destructive one can be. As some type of genetic superbeing, you are free to explore the city of New York any way you like. Have fun killing people, destroy the bases of the police/military or just look around for sidemissions and things to collect. In between you do a story mission to advance the plot and gain new abilities. By the end of the game you are almost unstoppable. The free world to explore, the many sidequests, awesome powers and interesting story with some twisted elements make this game a solid title.			"

												Now then, where to begin:TL;DR: get the console versions, the PC port is not good at all, but the game is good.The PC port is not optimised, so the frame-rate will chug when smoke &/or particle effects are going on, there is no option to play it in windowed mode and the timers in the PC version seem to be lowered for no apparent reason. Many cheap deaths as well from enemies you couldn’t see doing huge attacks. Also the lock-on system is garbage since it only shows priority targets one should remove first rather then what the player wants to target.All that said the game is good. The different attack styles one can use to kill enemies are really visceral. But what I will praise to the end is the movement system. If you play this game you will feel absolute joy just running amok on Manhattan Isle, mainly just running around like a mad Sonic the hedgehog killing NPCs as you please.I will say now I haven’t finished the final boss battle. The last segment of the battle is timed and because the timers are lowered on the PC version you won’t have enough time to actually finish it.So get the console versions: either the Xbox 360 or the PS3 version. The PC I don’t recommend either way. But it’s worth experiencing the pleasure of the movement system alone for the game.			"

												The chief theme here will be broad strokes, which is what Prototype has. It's got the framework of a bunch of cool stuff, and it works to an extent, but there's ample room for improvement in everything. Take for example, the movement. You can climb and jump around most anything, and going in a single direction feels awesome most of the time, you can glide and dash and leap to your heart's content. But, if you're trying to get a tricky collectable from atop an antenna or building, Alex will often tweak out and flip over and around everything in sight, and it's quite a job to wrestle him into precise movements. Want to turn left or right? Hope you've got a few seconds cause unstoppable forces don't turn on a dime. Another example: Do you hate collateral damage? Don't even, cause there is nothing you have that won't wipe out a 90 degree arc about 10 feet in front of you at least. You're going to be smashing civvies and other innocents all the time, and the game gives you a nice running total of how many families you've ruined after each fight, so good luck sleeping I guess.The actual in-game storyline is, nyeh? It's okay, it gives me an excuse to destroy all this junk, and it joins up all these events just fine. There were a couple of standout moments, but ultimately it was pretty by the numbers. It does tend to wrench control out of your hands to show you things during missions, or straight up transport you across the map afterwards, which can be annoying. The Web Of Intrigue though? That's some good stuff right there, loads of dropped hints and filling in the gaps, much speculation and other really cool junk. I spent ages just cruising the city looking for targets cause they were so interesting. Word of advice though, never skip a target movie, cause good luck remembering the name and then finding it in the hundred-something strong web.Combat: Losing relies chiefly on some very dubious things: Unavoidable chip damage, homing attacks, and super-damaging stunlocks. It's not that it's not challenging, cause you will die if you're not paying attention, but it's really going through the motions of action/reaction to the above three. Some cooped-in boss battles can make the game feel hard, and especially early in the game when you're not very powerful. Oftentimes you'll find yourself cheesing fights by staying on the move and chipping at stronger foes from range, because moving in for actual damage provides them with too many opportunities to stun/grab/hit you and it's not worth the risk. It makes fights more of a chore than fun sometimes, and that's not so great. Health is relatively easy to come by, by grabbing and eating mooks, but it makes every mistake another chore, since everything big hurts you so much you'll have to find and consume 2-3 of the little guys safely before you can re-engage. It skews the pacing and atmosphere of fights quite a bit, and it's often more advantageous to just bug out. Unless, of course, you're doing a scripted story mission or event that requires you to clear an area, in which case hunker down for the long haul. The AI isn't very smart, not at all, but they are numerous and widespread. It's not about outsmarting them, it's about outsmarting the group and learning to play the way they work to your advantage. Stealth isn't, really, but it does what it needs to and works within the larger framework. Many of the stronger enemies are niusances rather than challenges, but again you gain the powers to gib them or to lose them fairly early on, so it's not really too big of a deal.Speaking of powers, those are pretty cool. You get a bunch of different arms, some defensive stuff, some supports, and they all have a use. You'll probably find yourself favouring one or two though, since there's quite a bit of redundancy between them. I'd have liked to see some more differentiation, but only a small fraction are mandatory so I guess not having everything must be allowed for. There's lots of stuff to spend your money on, special moves for each power as well as ones for plain old fisticuffs, movement and health upgrades, super moves, the store really does overflow with stuff. The movement too, once you figure out how to do it right, it's a joy to traverse the city and the challenges become simple matters of route rather than speed. You can fly and dash and grab walls and leap and dive, there really are a lot of things you can do and that's great. Also, when you enter the power radial selection everything slows down for a second to let you pick, and that's awesome.While it's not perfect, Prototype has one excellent quality: Not many other games make you feel this powerful, this badass, all of the time. You have a couple of dozen ways to destroy the dude that's ineffectually pinging at you with his rifle, and you have so much health that you can afford to decide. If he brings ten friends, it still doesn't really matter cause you can just nab one and chuck him at the others and then elbow drop the rest before zipping up a building and being five blocks away before backup even thinks of arriving. If some tougher guys decide to chase you, you're stronger and faster than them so just hit them with a ventilation unit and disappear, because you can. It broaches on God Game territory sometimes, but you're running around on the ground being all-powerful, and that feels really good.+Fun as all hellOodles of powers and upgradesFeels godlike, manOptions, options, options-Poor PC controlsCombat can be cheap at timesShowing it's age graphicallyIn the end, Prototype was worth the time I put into it, and despite the above tirade, the good outweighs the bad. Much of it is just frustration about what could have been great but ended up being just good. But, that still leaves you with a good, fun game, with tons of things to do and stuff to see, and a lot of extra storyline junk for those interested.			"

												Activision's prototype for a game with no play-testing.  Controls are sloppy and often confusing.  Difficulty curve is all over the map: some ""hard"" events are trivial and other ""easy"" ones are nearly impossible.  Story had real potential but is too fragmented by the sandbox gameplay constantly disrupting it.Worth maybe $2.50 or so if you can grab it on sale, but really...just get Saint's Row 4 instead.  They took all the best and fun movement from Prototype and un-f*cked the rest of the game so people could actually enjoy it.			"

												Gameplay works, it's fun as hell and the powers are inventive. Your effectly ""The Thing"" you able to perfectly replicate any person and your body can be shaped and twised into devestating weapons on the fly.  Along with that, Movement is smooth and responsive, besides a few hiccups, it was after all one of the games that defined the super hero sandbox. The story, though bland gets the job done, but it's what had me stop playing. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game and worth the 20 bucks if you buy it not on sale, it's just I could not buy the protangoists ""anti-hero"" angle the story was trying the sell me...which causes the rest to fall apart as they attempted to make the enemies you fight ""Blackwatch"" so sterotypcially evil might as well give them snidely whiplash mustaches and kick puppies. To be fair I am only 13 hours into the game so I don't know how far I got into the story, but still..I am recomending it as game to buy..just that little problem I had with the story stacked up enough to where I didn't want to play anymore.

The specs are Intel Pentium D 3.5 GHz, 3.5gigs of ram and an Nvidia GeForce 9400 GT card.There were audio problems that I could not get rid of during cut scenes but otherwise the audio was fine during gameplay.Overall despite the bugs I really enjoyed the game and I think it is great considering when it was made so IF you have the computer specs to get Prototype 1 to work I would recommend buying it on sale. I also highly recommend Prototype 2 as it is the best open world chaos and destruction game I have ever played.			"

Also, when you enter the power radial selection everything slows down for a second to let you pick, and that's awesome.While it's not perfect, Prototype has one excellent quality: Not many other games make you feel this powerful, this badass, all of the time. You have a couple of dozen ways to destroy the dude that's ineffectually pinging at you with his rifle, and you have so much health that you can afford to decide. If he brings ten friends, it still doesn't really matter cause you can just nab one and chuck him at the others and then elbow drop the rest before zipping up a building and being five blocks away before backup even thinks of arriving. If some tougher guys decide to chase you, you're stronger and faster than them so just hit them with a ventilation unit and disappear, because you can. It broaches on God Game territory sometimes, but you're running around on the ground being all-powerful, and that feels really good.+Fun as all hellOodles of powers and upgradesFeels godlike, manOptions, options, options-Poor PC controlsCombat can be cheap at timesShowing it's age graphicallyIn the end, Prototype was worth the time I put into it, and despite the above tirade, the good outweighs the bad. Much of it is just frustration about what could have been great but ended up being just good. But, that still leaves you with a good, fun game, with tons of things to do and stuff to see, and a lot of extra storyline junk for those interested.			"

												I love this game so much, I didn't play it as soon as I got it and I completely regret it, the gameplay and story are amazing but I had the sound issue where I couldn't hear anyone talk, I had to download a sound program and put on different headsets just to hear them talk. I swear all the pc ports of this game are ♥♥♥♥ed we need more support from Activision, I know Radical Games went under but Activision still owns this games and they should be doing more to fix this.

												Pros: Great (anti) superhero-like game. Gameplay is fun, combat is good, and storyline is so-so. Cons: Fun game but one play-through is probably enough, so get on sale. Storyline is blan, but the gameplay makes up for it. Characters seem blan as well, but definately worth a playthrough.6/10 (Kinda reminds me of the Hulk video game on PS2)			"

The story, the characters, the pain that drives Alex Mercer to be a killer. It's amazing. it's beautiful. and you get to watch him grow. ♥♥♥♥. Yeah. Maybe the graphic options could use some work, but at this point, I don't care. It's Protoype. buy it.			"

												Now then, where to begin:TL;DR: get the console versions, the PC port is not good at all, but the game is good.The PC port is not optimised, so the frame-rate will chug when smoke &/or particle effects are going on, there is no option to play it in windowed mode and the timers in the PC version seem to be lowered for no apparent reason. Many cheap deaths as well from enemies you couldn’t see doing huge attacks. Also the lock-on system is garbage since it only shows priority targets one should remove first rather then what the player wants to target.All that said the game is good. The different attack styles one can use to kill enemies are really visceral. But what I will praise to the end is the movement system. If you play this game you will feel absolute joy just running amok on Manhattan Isle, mainly just running around like a mad Sonic the hedgehog killing NPCs as you please.I will say now I haven’t finished the final boss battle. The last segment of the battle is timed and because the timers are lowered on the PC version you won’t have enough time to actually finish it.So get the console versions: either the Xbox 360 or the PS3 version. The PC I don’t recommend either way. But it’s worth experiencing the pleasure of the movement system alone for the game.			"

												Finshed the game and wanting more. 9/10 for great gameplay, I really liked the powers Alex Mercer has especially that whip power. The whip power gets me to helicopters, and gets me to attack far away enemies. The parkour also looked great, but I've seen better.  6/10 for the story, I wasn't that clinged to the story. I didn't even watch the scenes. I just waited for the objective and do it, no questions asked.It's really an old game but it's really entertaining because of the open world and killing lots of civilians for no good reason. I recommend you t buy this game when it's on sale. I think I bought mine with the Prototype 2 which I'm gonna play some time after this. To sum up, 7/10 for the game, buy it on sale along with Prototype 2, so you can continue the story or like me just play another open world game and kill lots of people.  Again, 7/10, and buy it on sale. :D			"

												My oh my so much blood! Prototype is by far one of my most favorite games of all time (and despite what critics say, i look forward to playing the next one once it comes out on PC o_o). To make this review short and sweet, i will just explain the basics- The Incredible Hulk for original Xbox on steroids o___________o. Turn your every body part into a blade of somesort and raage an immense open wolrd New York with your hellish fury after a long day at work. With more dismemberments then a SAW film, if your twisted (like me) you may get a giddy school girl laugh every time you watch a sliced in half torso fly through the streets. Speaking of flying, you CAN fly in this game (Sort of, its gliding but it means the same thing i guess). You can consume ANYBODY in the game and become them to evade from the nosy police and the Marines. Did i mention blood thirsty zombies and huge mutants? I didnt? Well they are trying to kill you too.

												The story is kinda cool and it would make a good movie if it was done right. but the thing that makes this game so addictive and awesome is how well the unique concept is carried out. It's just... simply... very ♥♥♥♥ing cool and loads and loads of fun. The character upgrade system is also well thought out and you get upgrades at a pace that fits mastering each new move and/or combo. The action is intense and gets even more intense as the game progresses and the stuff you can do is really awesome and fun. I should probably play through again and use the heli's less, but they were so much fun!!!One thing that's weird though in the game is the AI. While half of the city is in chaos, the other half of the city is just gingerly getting on with their days, oblivous to the other half being infected by hideos mutants tearing people limb from limb and infecting those that don't escape. I suppose though, that this is comparable to good old GTA where hiding from the cops for 5 minutes makes them forget that you've commited genocide and burned half the city down.			"

This game pretty much let you do what you feel like, wether that acting like a total loony and just kill everything in sight, or run around and do missions. I myself is a mix of both, plus I also like to be creative when it comes to throw things after other things. Ever tried throwing a car at a helicopter?

												Overall a fun game.  The story is basically resident evil.. virus outbreak although unlike it you are insanely overpowered even on hard diff..   I like the fact that you fight both the military and the infected however the AI on the military is just sad you can literally do the most insane♥♥♥♥♥♥right in front of them and they won't react never mind the fact that you are obviously not human or that you are supposed to be a ""priority target"" even if you do get in trouble you can kill all of them or evade them without much of a struggle.    The infected are even less of a threat then the military. Once you learn the move set of the enemy they become closer to tedious then to a challenge including what is supposed to be bosses which just take more time to kill and are still easy to evade sins you are extremely fast.   Apart from the protagonist characters somehow don't feel complete.  The gameplay is pretty cool. Basically you are very fast and agile. Most of the time you will be jumping from one rooftop to another. Has a good variety of weapons and powers and you can even steal tanks and helicopters from the military and use them to your advantage. The stealth system is just about the only thing i dislike in the gameplay sins all the NPC's are blind, deaf and suffer from a rare disorder in which their mind goes blank and forget everything every 5 seconds or they might as well be in a coma.  I'd go ether way with the recommendation depends on what you want to play.  Even with all the issues it has it is still fun to go fight endless waves of enemies and see how long you are going to last. That is until you learn how to heal up fast and that the waves are not actually endless...			"

But is poor on the story, and amazingly for a game that lets you elbow drop onto a tank from a skyscraper, it does nothing to embrace it's emergent capabilities. And once the novel factor wears off it turns repetitive. The game deserves a premise for that single novel factor, though don't expect nothing after groundbraking, or surprising. Missions are too long and repetitive and the  characthers are there to fill in the gaps.Also there's zombies.			"

												Fun game, played it on all systems it was released for and PC is by far my favorite even with the graphics bug that is present in the game. Overall a fun experience with an interesting story, and mechanic of unlocking the story, that builds up to a natural finale. While the characters are sometimes bland and the main is a bit of an emo crybaby at times, the gameplay is still very interesting and is greatly improved upon in the sequel despite the story taking a turn. Overall it's a good game but I wouldn't hold out for it being ground breaking or revolutionary.8/10Pros:Fun gameplayLarge open areaInteresting storyCan throw old people at helicopters.Cons:Bland charactersMain character is a literal god (his codename is Zeus) but acts like he's powerless for the first bit of the game.No replayabilitiyCollectibles (unless you're into that)			"

												The story is kinda cool and it would make a good movie if it was done right. but the thing that makes this game so addictive and awesome is how well the unique concept is carried out. It's just... simply... very ♥♥♥♥ing cool and loads and loads of fun. The character upgrade system is also well thought out and you get upgrades at a pace that fits mastering each new move and/or combo. The action is intense and gets even more intense as the game progresses and the stuff you can do is really awesome and fun. I should probably play through again and use the heli's less, but they were so much fun!!!One thing that's weird though in the game is the AI. While half of the city is in chaos, the other half of the city is just gingerly getting on with their days, oblivous to the other half being infected by hideos mutants tearing people limb from limb and infecting those that don't escape. I suppose though, that this is comparable to good old GTA where hiding from the cops for 5 minutes makes them forget that you've commited genocide and burned half the city down.			"

												It's the kind of gameplay you want to insert into various other Sandbox - Games like GTA. It has an incredible story to follow with each new milestone in the game, and with every new discovery you make you're able to use more abilities in your combats with the in-game militia and/or the several mutants.I'm looking forward to the sequel, mainly because of the story, the gameplay is as it is already one hell of a fighting simulation :D			"

												The chief theme here will be broad strokes, which is what Prototype has. It's got the framework of a bunch of cool stuff, and it works to an extent, but there's ample room for improvement in everything. Take for example, the movement. You can climb and jump around most anything, and going in a single direction feels awesome most of the time, you can glide and dash and leap to your heart's content. But, if you're trying to get a tricky collectable from atop an antenna or building, Alex will often tweak out and flip over and around everything in sight, and it's quite a job to wrestle him into precise movements. Want to turn left or right? Hope you've got a few seconds cause unstoppable forces don't turn on a dime. Another example: Do you hate collateral damage? Don't even, cause there is nothing you have that won't wipe out a 90 degree arc about 10 feet in front of you at least. You're going to be smashing civvies and other innocents all the time, and the game gives you a nice running total of how many families you've ruined after each fight, so good luck sleeping I guess.The actual in-game storyline is, nyeh? It's okay, it gives me an excuse to destroy all this junk, and it joins up all these events just fine. There were a couple of standout moments, but ultimately it was pretty by the numbers. It does tend to wrench control out of your hands to show you things during missions, or straight up transport you across the map afterwards, which can be annoying. The Web Of Intrigue though? That's some good stuff right there, loads of dropped hints and filling in the gaps, much speculation and other really cool junk. I spent ages just cruising the city looking for targets cause they were so interesting. Word of advice though, never skip a target movie, cause good luck remembering the name and then finding it in the hundred-something strong web.Combat: Losing relies chiefly on some very dubious things: Unavoidable chip damage, homing attacks, and super-damaging stunlocks. It's not that it's not challenging, cause you will die if you're not paying attention, but it's really going through the motions of action/reaction to the above three. Some cooped-in boss battles can make the game feel hard, and especially early in the game when you're not very powerful. Oftentimes you'll find yourself cheesing fights by staying on the move and chipping at stronger foes from range, because moving in for actual damage provides them with too many opportunities to stun/grab/hit you and it's not worth the risk. It makes fights more of a chore than fun sometimes, and that's not so great. Health is relatively easy to come by, by grabbing and eating mooks, but it makes every mistake another chore, since everything big hurts you so much you'll have to find and consume 2-3 of the little guys safely before you can re-engage. It skews the pacing and atmosphere of fights quite a bit, and it's often more advantageous to just bug out. Unless, of course, you're doing a scripted story mission or event that requires you to clear an area, in which case hunker down for the long haul. The AI isn't very smart, not at all, but they are numerous and widespread. It's not about outsmarting them, it's about outsmarting the group and learning to play the way they work to your advantage. Stealth isn't, really, but it does what it needs to and works within the larger framework. Many of the stronger enemies are niusances rather than challenges, but again you gain the powers to gib them or to lose them fairly early on, so it's not really too big of a deal.Speaking of powers, those are pretty cool. You get a bunch of different arms, some defensive stuff, some supports, and they all have a use. You'll probably find yourself favouring one or two though, since there's quite a bit of redundancy between them. I'd have liked to see some more differentiation, but only a small fraction are mandatory so I guess not having everything must be allowed for. There's lots of stuff to spend your money on, special moves for each power as well as ones for plain old fisticuffs, movement and health upgrades, super moves, the store really does overflow with stuff. The movement too, once you figure out how to do it right, it's a joy to traverse the city and the challenges become simple matters of route rather than speed. You can fly and dash and grab walls and leap and dive, there really are a lot of things you can do and that's great. Also, when you enter the power radial selection everything slows down for a second to let you pick, and that's awesome.While it's not perfect, Prototype has one excellent quality: Not many other games make you feel this powerful, this badass, all of the time. You have a couple of dozen ways to destroy the dude that's ineffectually pinging at you with his rifle, and you have so much health that you can afford to decide. If he brings ten friends, it still doesn't really matter cause you can just nab one and chuck him at the others and then elbow drop the rest before zipping up a building and being five blocks away before backup even thinks of arriving. If some tougher guys decide to chase you, you're stronger and faster than them so just hit them with a ventilation unit and disappear, because you can. It broaches on God Game territory sometimes, but you're running around on the ground being all-powerful, and that feels really good.+Fun as all hellOodles of powers and upgradesFeels godlike, manOptions, options, options-Poor PC controlsCombat can be cheap at timesShowing it's age graphicallyIn the end, Prototype was worth the time I put into it, and despite the above tirade, the good outweighs the bad. Much of it is just frustration about what could have been great but ended up being just good. But, that still leaves you with a good, fun game, with tons of things to do and stuff to see, and a lot of extra storyline junk for those interested.			"

												Meh. So I got this game on sale and I guess it is worth it but proceed with caution. This game is hard as hell. It's also very repetitive. People who say this game is a GTA game on steroids, are very wrong. This game is nothing like GTA. Far from it actually. The games glitches are constant, the story is pathetic, and the gameplay has some getting used to. It's a fun game but only for the beat down part. The sandbox element is there but don't expect much from it. If you're playing for story, look else where. The story is stupid and the missions are sometimes so unbearable. Here's a run down of a typical missionGo to doctor*5 minutes laterDoctor wants to to kill♥♥♥♥♥♥for him *45 minutes later of contantly getting blown up by tanks and helicoptorsDoctor tells you he can't help you*MISSION COMPLETEDThat's a majority of the story and the game itself. So overall, this game is passable but if it's on sale, get it. You may find yourself enjoying it more than I do.			"

												Now then, where to begin:TL;DR: get the console versions, the PC port is not good at all, but the game is good.The PC port is not optimised, so the frame-rate will chug when smoke &/or particle effects are going on, there is no option to play it in windowed mode and the timers in the PC version seem to be lowered for no apparent reason. Many cheap deaths as well from enemies you couldn’t see doing huge attacks. Also the lock-on system is garbage since it only shows priority targets one should remove first rather then what the player wants to target.All that said the game is good. The different attack styles one can use to kill enemies are really visceral. But what I will praise to the end is the movement system. If you play this game you will feel absolute joy just running amok on Manhattan Isle, mainly just running around like a mad Sonic the hedgehog killing NPCs as you please.I will say now I haven’t finished the final boss battle. The last segment of the battle is timed and because the timers are lowered on the PC version you won’t have enough time to actually finish it.So get the console versions: either the Xbox 360 or the PS3 version. The PC I don’t recommend either way. But it’s worth experiencing the pleasure of the movement system alone for the game.			"

												Amazingly fun game. The graphics aren't great even on full settings, the plot is entertaining but on a B movie level, but the actual gameplay more than makes up for both of these flaws. It took me a good 15 hours to beat the main campaign but I spent a majority of that time trying to get gold on every little side mission in between the main mission, all of which I found incredibly fun. There are few games that will make you feel like more of a badass and give you more choice with how to accomplish a task. One of the boss battles was ridiculously boring, and the combat can get a bit repetitive if you don't mix things up. Great game, would play again.			"

												Prototype is a game about being the worst human being to ever walk the face of the planet.It is a game about pulling people in half,  turning your arms into sledgehammers and making a street full of chunky salsa, and carrying pedestrians to a rooftop to surf their bodies into freefall. You'll walk away. They won't.My favorite thing to do in Prototype is infiltrate a military base and slowly walk through it, using my protoplasmic tentacles to absorb and devour soldiers unseen. When there's only me and one other guy left, I drop my disguise and slowly walk towards him while he screams and shoots wildly. It's like being the monster in a horror movie, except most of them cut away before the final victim gets shredded.In the late game there are some seriously hard boss fights that will stop your progress dead unless you're an expert at hit-and-run. I have not finished this game, but I don't really feel like I needed to.There's a sequel coming. I can't wait to be even more of a♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

There's a good variety of weapons, some of them (the ones growing out of Mercer) have very wide move sets, which expand as the game goes on. The combat overall feels tightly paced, what with all the recovery animations and slow-mo, but I never really felt it was overdone. There's a nice bit of escallation, too, with both the mutants and the army getting a bit sillier with every chapter, and you getting new powers to deal with them.			"

												Good stuff. Some of the boss battles were pretty tough, especially the last one. I like the protagonist of the first game much more than the second one, but the government conspiracy story about viruses is good in both of these. I'd say Umbrella has something to learn from Gentek if you know what I mean.			"

												Want to become a super-villain terrorizing a city full of civilians, military personnel and infected? Want to hijack choppers mid-air and blow up some hives and military bases? Want to park near Central Park with a tank/apc and kill everything in sight? Want to pose as a military officer and just shoot infected while civilians run like scared little children?If you answered yes to any one of the above questions, you should get this. If you didn't, you are not fun at all and you should read Fun Manual 101!			"

												Let's just get this out of the way now, the graphics, could be better, and there's not a preferable amount of resolutions, now if you are still reading, GOOD, if not, shame on you! This game is immense amounts of fun to play, you are this super powered, amazing guy named Alex Mercer, you get a good amount of powers, and there's a nice story to go with, AND an open world, what more could you ask for?Beter PC preformance, that's what. This game is...eh...on a 6GB AMD dual core @ 2.70GHz, But still palyable, just have to make it look like, well, crap.9/10, Really fun, but graphics are, less than preferable.			"

												I'd been unable to finish this game years ago but finally got around to finishing it and, you know what? It was the greatest feeling in the world. This game ROCKS, even with the bugs it has here and there. Honestly, I love this game WAY more than I like Prototype 2. That being because, (SPOILERS), I feel Alex Mercer is a wonderful protagonist that teeters on the edge of both hero and villlian, yet openly chooses to do more heroic deeds for the safety of New York. This in itself is a great build for him that I like much much more than his totally evil version in the second game.I'd definately recommend this game to anyone like me that just wants to to parkour like a godamn demon velociraptor around NYC without a care in the world.FYI if you're thinking of getting the game: There's a persistent glitch that causes video and audio to become unsyched and choppy during major cutscenes. It's never been and most likely never will be patched, and it's hard as hell to adjust your settings to get of too. I couldn't get rid of it at all, but either way it's not game breaking. You can still get all the information out of the scenes, even if it is annoying.TL;DR: Get the game, it rocks. It's got a bug or two, but it isn't at all game breaking.			"

												A very intense, often disturbing, man versus city, death and destruction action game with an intriguing sci-fi conspiracy plot. In terms of action intensity, this easily owns GTA. There are plenty of special abilities to be unlocked.Most memorable and entertaining element of the game is the ability to jump from helicopter to helicopter high above the city, pulling out pilots and throwing them away, then flying the chopper yourself!

												One of my all time favourite games. Sequel is also very good. Extremely enjoyable gameplay, doesn't shy away from making you overpowered. But keeps it interesting.

												Ever had a dream were you were flying through the air and then you go down to want to jump again? Well this is the type of game that puts you in that scenario. You can glide and fight to your hearts content. There are extra mission to be completed that keep you occupied if the main story gets you bored. The main story is trying to unlock what happened to Alex Mercer and how he can fix things. You play a good but bad guy at the same time. This is a free roaming 3rd person action adventure game that gives you the action all the way to the end. The enemies and some of the missions can be difficult at times, the obvious solution isn't always the best solution to completing a mission. It was a great game to play and I highly recommend getting this game when you see it on sale because you'll get your time to money ratio balanced. It was a awesome free roaming game and If free roaming action games are what you like then this is the game for you!			"

Some minor issues such as nobody suspecting a man wall-running skyscrapers, reaching huge heights with a simple jump, running twice Usain Bolt's max speed down a freeway, punching an infected so that he travels about 1km, etc. 10000000000/10			"

												Okay this game is good now i say that as in its not bad, but could be better. And how they couldve improved on that is the story. Now the story to me its not quite clear what your main objective is because might i say Alex is a bit of a dumba$$ but we will forgive him,  buit not knowing exactly what your main goal is, is...just not quite right but its still okay and pretty interesting of course leaving out the part of alex being an idiot. But then there are the cutscenes, the cutscenes with alex in them makes them confusing, not complicated just confusing because alex has the IQ of a rock his dialog is......not on the inteligent side making it hard to follow the storyline now for JUST THE STORY i would give it like a 7 or a 7.5 strictly because of how dumb alex is. But at this point youd be like ew bad story i dont want to sit through that. Well learning the fact that after you beat one mission you get more bada$$ powers drives you to want to play the story more. So if you want this game buy it more in the idea of your going to run around and kill people with awseome powers and upgrades not in the aspect of the story that much. My opinion but had to point it out.			"

I wanted to game a couple years ago when I watched theRadBrad (Youtuber) play it and now I finally got the chance to grab it myself and I love it. Literally the perfect game for me, the violence, open world, third person, a good varity of powers/abilities, shapeshifiting. Did I mention that you can throw people at helicopters and watch them explode.. no?

												Probz the most fun i have had in a open map video game, Its the only one i prefer that you DON'T use a tank xD, they just really slow you down.The Story is pretty good, the way it goes back and forth is really ♥♥♥♥ing cool. I just ♥♥♥♥ing love the powers you get XD, they are SUPER fun and they never get old, at all. And the farther you get into the story, the more ♥♥♥♥ing cool the powers get10/10 - ign: still playing it, but once im done it: would play again			"

												Not even at half off would this game be an ideal one. You'd need to wait for it to be five dollars to consider it worthy of purchase.It sounds good in theory: badass guy, shapeshifting, conspiracy, etc. But the problem is, as far as the main missions go, it's very linear -- you have to do EXACTLY what the developers wanted you to, or you will fail., Gameplay is numbingly repetitive. You're out for revenge, and for this tough guy you're playing, there are still some enemies that can whup you (like humans, or infected humans) which make you seem weaker than you're supposed to be.So, if in reality you want ridiculously annoying missions that feel rigged sometimes, and to chuck cars at people and buildings, leap up into helicopters and kill the driver and subsequently drive it yourself, fine and dandy. This, however, doesn't bring anything new to the table. Huge letdown.Also, there's a weird thing with the sound. Seems quieter than it should be.			"

Warning: You might have to mess around with the game files and community patches to support your resolution.Fun open world, 3rd person platforming and combat. The story is ♥♥♥♥ing awful, and none of the characters are likeable or interesting. If you don't care about the story, the dark, angsty, monotonous tone of the game will become very draining.Some parts of the game are extremely difficult, and every time I overcame such challenges I never felt a sense of accomplishment. It was never a matter of problem solving or honing my skills, but rather a matter of fluke, or exploiting one of game's poorly designed mechanics.What made me stay to the end was the freedom and power the game provides you. Sprinting up the side of a building at 60 kmph while throwing cars at old ladies is a unique experience, one that I have found nowhere else.Also apparently it runs terribly on AMD card, but mine seemed to handle it fine. (390)Recommended to those who like action-platformers with a focus on combat, and can deal with terrible stories and messing around with config files. Get it on sale. "

												Fan of the xb360 version. Sold the 360 and opted to build a PC instead of shelling out for an xb1. i7 4790k 4.6oc. 16gb ram. 2x r9 280 oc1095gpu/1350vram. FRAPS benchmark with everything on high and using the Anchient Game Fixes 1080p ""mod"". FRAPS got a min of 108fps, max of 123fps and the highest average was 118fps, the lowest average was 116fps. Koodos to the upscale port. Plays very smooth so far. This will bring back some memories and it'll be like playing it in a ""new light"". Graphics settings turned all the way up and boy does she look like the purdiest prototype I've ever seen. First one (this one) will always be the better of the two in my book. The game was like a blend of GTA mixed with some Marvel Super Hero type ish. Fun and entertaining even if it gets repeditive towards the end, if I recall. But the complete play through doesn't last too long so I always remember being happy with my experience on the xb360. It will be neat to replay this with wayyyyy better graphics. :)For 1080p

The gameplay is amazing though, and I had plenty of fun as Alex Mercer, our stone-cold proto-tagonist (I'll stop now.) and using his awesome power to destroy things. You feel like an all-powerful god, but the game still has challenge to it that keeps it from being totally boring.A throughly enjoyable experience all around, and something you want in your library if you liked Rock Star's Infamous and Infamous 2.

I finished this in 3 days and just had so much fun.  It's like Hulk: Ultimate distruction mixed with GTA and a dash of Spider-Man 2.  It's cheap and it's a good solid game, pick it up for a good 15 hour romp.			"

												Where Protoype shines is the open-world traversal around the city as you gain more powers. The combat is fun enough and the carnage you can cause is defintely fun. However, the story is all over the place and tires way too hard to be edgy, leading to a very, very unsatifyng final boss.I'd recommend this game to those who, like me, can enjoy a good brawler with open-world elements. Worth picking up on a sale.			"

												Ever had a dream were you were flying through the air and then you go down to want to jump again? Well this is the type of game that puts you in that scenario. You can glide and fight to your hearts content. There are extra mission to be completed that keep you occupied if the main story gets you bored. The main story is trying to unlock what happened to Alex Mercer and how he can fix things. You play a good but bad guy at the same time. This is a free roaming 3rd person action adventure game that gives you the action all the way to the end. The enemies and some of the missions can be difficult at times, the obvious solution isn't always the best solution to completing a mission. It was a great game to play and I highly recommend getting this game when you see it on sale because you'll get your time to money ratio balanced. It was a awesome free roaming game and If free roaming action games are what you like then this is the game for you!			"

												Prototype is a game about being the worst human being to ever walk the face of the planet.It is a game about pulling people in half,  turning your arms into sledgehammers and making a street full of chunky salsa, and carrying pedestrians to a rooftop to surf their bodies into freefall. You'll walk away. They won't.My favorite thing to do in Prototype is infiltrate a military base and slowly walk through it, using my protoplasmic tentacles to absorb and devour soldiers unseen. When there's only me and one other guy left, I drop my disguise and slowly walk towards him while he screams and shoots wildly. It's like being the monster in a horror movie, except most of them cut away before the final victim gets shredded.In the late game there are some seriously hard boss fights that will stop your progress dead unless you're an expert at hit-and-run. I have not finished this game, but I don't really feel like I needed to.There's a sequel coming. I can't wait to be even more of a♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Okay this game is good now i say that as in its not bad, but could be better. And how they couldve improved on that is the story. Now the story to me its not quite clear what your main objective is because might i say Alex is a bit of a dumba$$ but we will forgive him,  buit not knowing exactly what your main goal is, is...just not quite right but its still okay and pretty interesting of course leaving out the part of alex being an idiot. But then there are the cutscenes, the cutscenes with alex in them makes them confusing, not complicated just confusing because alex has the IQ of a rock his dialog is......not on the inteligent side making it hard to follow the storyline now for JUST THE STORY i would give it like a 7 or a 7.5 strictly because of how dumb alex is. But at this point youd be like ew bad story i dont want to sit through that. Well learning the fact that after you beat one mission you get more bada$$ powers drives you to want to play the story more. So if you want this game buy it more in the idea of your going to run around and kill people with awseome powers and upgrades not in the aspect of the story that much. My opinion but had to point it out.			"

Pros:♥♥♥♥♥♥looks like Guyver+I loved John Carpenter's The Thing+Zombies+Immersive world+Side quests are rewarding+Meaty body giblets+Has a Story Mode+Cons:-Story can get confusing-Where is Dana?This is a fantastic biopunk game, which simply must be played. Of course, Activision's ""sterling"" reputation in previous years has been a warning for most of there games, but Prototype seems to be an exception. Although I played this game a whole SIX YEARS after its release, this is still a solid game. It deficiencies in quality graphics are more than made up by the ground breaking world design and ai for its time. What feels like a hundred different cars, zombies, soldiers, and civilians in an ever changing map runs very smoothly. Now this isn't much for the standard computer now, but just how all these actors interact is astounding. Cars will swerve away from zombies and have car crashes while helicopters swoop by over head and the distant gunfire of a soldier can be heard. When playing this game I couldn't help but get immersed.9/10 -It's like those really good spiderman games turned spiderman into The Thing, make him wear a leather jacket, and fight zombies. "

												A great game, really. Your'e able to distort your body to form weapons (claws, armor, wrecking balls for hands, etc), and then tear people up God Of War style. Free roaming, similar to Grand Theft Auto. Run around killing people for hours for the hell of it, or advance the plot. Really fun game, maybe a little short. You can get through the main plot line in about 13-15 hours, depending on how much trouble you have with bosses near the end.			"

												Even though the story is generic and the graphics are not that great this game is freaking amazing, great gameplay, one of the best open world that you can have fun just by running and gliding and the powers are amazing. The only problem that I have with the gameplay is that there are 2 o 3 moments where the difficulty spike is brutal but you can easily recover because Alex is practically immortal.			"

												This game is amazing! The powers are so cool and the disgiuse ability is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing but the side missions are nothing special here besides the base infiltrations but even that can get kinda repetitive but its still a fun game to play. Boss fights are also cool and even fun to play. The web of intrigue is also cool and interesting. Once you start to get more powers you can start going crazy around the city. Story is also interesting but the missions can kinda get repetitive. Do not miss out on a game like this. If you like the idea of an anti hero and the fact that when you kill someone you have no consequences buy this game!			"

												Insanely fun game, I love devouring people and becoming them aswell as upgrading and unlocking new powers its so badass, graphics arnt the best but I'm not bothered about it because as long as it runs I'm fine. I wanted to game a couple years ago when I watched theRadBrad (Youtuber) play it and now I finally got the chance to grab it myself and I love it. Literally the perfect game for me, the violence, open world, third person, a good varity of powers/abilities, shapeshifiting. Did I mention that you can throw people at helicopters and watch them explode.. no? I highly reccomend this game and would love to get Prototype 2 some day.(Wish it had windowed mode though. cri)			"

												If you really want to play  something without a hard story, because your life too stressing and you only want to destroy things with amazing powers an movements out of this world, this game is for you.Sprint or fly into in a free world map (of NY), make parkour or destroy everything at your way; it doesn´t matter at all, but you can also make a buch of secondary missions or follow the main story of a prototype of a superhuman who accidentally drop a super toxic virus and that´s why the whole US goverment is trying to chase him.

												If I could give a neutral recommendation I would, because this is just an okay port of a decent game.Every good point about Prototype seems to have a countervailing drawback. Maneuvering Alex around Manhattan has a thrilling feeling of hurtling along the streets in a blur of barely-controlled speed, but this makes it very easy to fling yourself in the wrong direction (off a building, into a military base, etc...) and the controls become infuriating any time you have to move with speed and precision. Naturally, I didn't bother with most of the ""movement"" optional events (even playing with an Xbox controller). Furthermore, Manhattan is just large enough that criss-crossing the island as you go from one event to the next takes just barely long enough to become tiresome.The side event system itself includes some real winners - I personally got a kick out of the War, Kill, and Glide events - but also some stinkers, such as Movement and Consume. The subset of ""Military Consume"" events where you have to grab X targets in Y minutes are utter garbage that highlight the worst aspects of the game. On the other hand, the ""Military Consume"" base infiltration and base destruction missions are a lot of fun, so it's a mixed bag.Finding and eating targets to fill out the Web of Intrigue starts off as... intriguing (ba-dum psh)... but eventually becomes an onerous chore, and you don't get anything for completing it. I finished the Web on YouTube and walked away feeling relieved I didn't bother finishing it in game.Generally, the combat is engaging and fluid, much the way the Batman Arkham series aspires to be. With Alex, as compared to Batman, there's a much greater sense of personal power as you lay waste to your enemies. You almost have to feel pity for them; most of these puny mortals are your playthings - grabbing a guy with the whipfist and flinging him at his friends is a real rush and is as easy as a few well-timed button presses. However, the boss encounters are feats of poor design; I ended up having to beat each boss by spamming the whipfist in circle-strafe. The boss that pops out of the street (about 2/3 of the way through the game) was so infuriating that I nearly ragequit.Technically speaking, the audio in the cinematics is borked. I carried out the recommended fix (unpacking the audio archives into the game directory; Google it for details) and it didn't do diddly for me. It really kind of sucks, but it doesn't affect gameplay or in-engine audio, so it's a pain in the behind rather than a game-breaker.Overall, I had enough fun with Prototype, in spite of its flaws, that I'm willing to give it a half-hearted thumbs up. Pay no more than $5 for it and you'll get your money's worth.			"

												I'd been unable to finish this game years ago but finally got around to finishing it and, you know what? It was the greatest feeling in the world. This game ROCKS, even with the bugs it has here and there. Honestly, I love this game WAY more than I like Prototype 2. That being because, (SPOILERS), I feel Alex Mercer is a wonderful protagonist that teeters on the edge of both hero and villlian, yet openly chooses to do more heroic deeds for the safety of New York. This in itself is a great build for him that I like much much more than his totally evil version in the second game.I'd definately recommend this game to anyone like me that just wants to to parkour like a godamn demon velociraptor around NYC without a care in the world.FYI if you're thinking of getting the game: There's a persistent glitch that causes video and audio to become unsyched and choppy during major cutscenes. It's never been and most likely never will be patched, and it's hard as hell to adjust your settings to get of too. I couldn't get rid of it at all, but either way it's not game breaking. You can still get all the information out of the scenes, even if it is annoying.TL;DR: Get the game, it rocks. It's got a bug or two, but it isn't at all game breaking.			"

												Okay... this is FUN.Disgusting, sure, and pretty disturbing the way you can absorb people, but the game is worth it just for the ultra-parkour experience, running up the sides of buildings, leaping, gliding, crashing, even just running down the street faster than the cars can. Not to mention the mayhem you can visit on the military and the infected, flinging cars at helicopters, hijacking vehicles, making taxis have giant pileups in an attempt to get out of your way, making spikes come out of the ground and disguising yourself as a base commander.Upgrades, challenges, detectors, new infected creatures and twists to the story round it off, on top of which, it's a pretty good rendition of New York City, what I remember of it.

												Intro:Prototype is a fun game, it allows you to become a man called Alex who has the potential to have many baddass powers.While playing this game you unlock these powers and I must say they are extremely fun to use. Its one of those games where once you've started it you don't wanna stop. I recomend this to anyone who enjoyed any of the infamous games and for people that want to KILL EVERYTHING!Pros:- fun powers- good story- very satisfying- large open world- fun free roam- good mechanicsCons:- very difficult bosses- resolution can't go up to 1080p (this can be fixed)- dissapointing graphics- targeting system can get hectic due to so many enemies on screen I rate this game 7.5/10			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Prototype is a game developed by Radical Entertainment and published by ActivisionTraversing in the open world city of Protoype is amazing, probably one of the best in any open world game. You can easily run up buildings, jump off to great heights and then glide very seamlessly. The side activities are very fun ranging from running obstacle courses hitting checkpoints, killing a certain number of enemies using certain powers and using helicopters/tanks to kill enemies. Every activity has a bronze, silver and gold medal depending on how well you complete itThe gameplay mechanics work well, you are given several different powers/abilities to kill enemies and completing main mission, side activities reward you with experience to upgrade your character. However, Prototype does suffer with bland graphics even for an open world game. Granted, the number of pedestrians, vehicles, enemies, explosions etc. on screen is very impressive so have bland graphics is easier to acceptThe game does have a decent story that is told both through cutscenes and consuming enemies/people. After consuming a person, you are treated to a short video of their memory. A cool way to tell the story and mix it with the gameplay. The game is all about getting you in the action as fast as possible so the story takes a back seat to everything elseThe main missions are fun and are somewhat varied but most of them feel like you are either killing tons of enemies or running around chasing somebody.Sadly, Prototype is a technical mess to put it mildly with a very limited resolution and given the vast number of objects on screen at any given time the targeting system seems to target everything except for the one thing you want it to target and the boss battles can create a frustrating difficulty spikeHowever, Prototype is a very fun if not flawed game. If you feel like running around and killing things with crazy powers and watching a lot of things explode, then this may just scratch that itch RECOMMENDED :)  "

The abilities your character has and gains are a lot of fun and different from any other game I've played before.			"

												I give this game a 7/10. Story is good (not good enough though, I still feel like it's kinda cheap) but the playability of the game makes up for it. Also the progression system along with the side events feel really accomplishing throughout the game.			"

												My Rating for the game is a 9/10!The game is wonderful, the story line is very detailed and you understand who you are and what happened and what even is happening currently. There's tons of upgrades for you're chararcter and you get cool abilitys such as claws or huge fists. Not to mention you can do little somewhat side quests such as race to finish line in a limited amount of time or land on a certain target. Only issues I have is the mouse is a bit buggy at times and the controls can be confusing at times, other then that...it's a very great game and if you like open world type games with gore and dark moods, then you will love this game by much.
