												Greetings gamer wench! Or should I just call you Tina? I am DEATHSPANK, vanquisher of evil, dispenser of justice and a hero to the downtrodden. Review this game you say? Who needs reviews when we can have disco night? I, DEATHSPANK slay my enemies with impeccable grace while also looking good in purple (no actual chickens were harmed in the duration of this game). My goal is to find THE ARTIFACT, which I need, because of reasons, while my source of power comes from a special thong as well as a finely maintained dental line. But the most important thing of all is that where DEATHSPANK is involved, justice is served just like my tea: with two sugars, a little lemon, and a splash of milk.			"

												If DeathSpank has anything to offer, it is charm. And orphans. It's a simple action slash RPG game that does all the heavy lifting for you. All the armor and weapons you receive upgrade automatically, and really the only effort you need to maintain your inventory is making sure you have enough space for everything. There are a lot of side-quests but mostly all of them are pretty simple and straightforward, and aren't really necessary in completing the game. This is a funny game with an outrageous plot and wacky characters, so it just wants you to sit back and have a good time. It's not trying to be more than what it is, and it knows that. I recommend playing the game on Hard if you want some sort of challenge, reading every dialogue option to get the most out of the humor in the game, and to take your time. You can get all the achievements in one play through and it's really all you need.			"

												Deathspank is a comedic RPG where the eponymous Deathspank is on an epic quest to find The Artifact, a mysterious item of mysterious mystery. Armed with both heroic strength and sharp wit, Deathspank is a Dispenser of Justice, a Vanquisher of Evil, and a Hero to the Downtrodden. Battle your way through demons, orcs, chickens, leprechauns and many more while completing your quests and filling your bag with awesome loot (and orphans).Whether or not this results in a positive experience really depends on your sense of humor. Personally I found the whole game extremely fun, never frustrating and quite consistently hilarious, however I can appreciate silly “potty humor” which this game is overflowing with.(pun intended)Pros:Witty jokesLampshade hangingThongs and orphansCons:Not enough thongs and orphansNo orphans in thongsp.s. i will edit with pictures.....WHEN STEAM FIXES THEY'RE @!#$%^&*()			"

												All in all a pretty solid game. The humor is fun if it's your type of humor (ex: She took the ""fun"" out of orphan). The controls are smooth and easy to use (used a controller - not sure if keyboard/mouse is as good). The overall story is decent. The teleport system could have used a bit more guidance. Big + is the achievements are easy to get -- 100% in about 10 hours of gameplay -- for people who go for achievements. I enjoyed the animation as well. Recommended.			"

												When I heard Ron Gilbert was gonna make an Action RPG I was thrilled and, as it turned out, rightly so. I suppose DeathSpank can be best described as the hilarious brother of Diablo. One example for the great humor: ""I once slayed a dragon!"" ""Really? That's amazing!"" ""Well, I didn't really slay it and it wasn't technically a dragon. What I meant to say is: I once kicked a cat!"" My favorite quote of the game!Took me 16 hours to completely finish it (including all achievements) and I had tons of fun!			"

												""Diablo 2 meets Monkey Island?""Not so sure about that--but DeathSpank may just be Guybrush's heroic (albeit slightly slow) cousin, sword-spinning his way to defeating evil Lord von Prong. Plenty of bad guys, loot, and, uh, snacks await you on this epic quest.Environments, items and enemies offer plenty of variety. In terms of replayability, there is not much to be had there--although the game may be worth revisiting after a year or two have passed. Multiplayer feels like an afterthought, but it is actually possible to have an (offline) friend assist you at all times.For your money, you're looking at around 6 to 10 hours of gameplay (depending on how you play it and if you want to do all the side quests). You decide if it's worth it. While you're at it, you might want to buy the sequels (DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue and The Baconing) along with this game, or else the ending (or lack thereof) may disappoint you.For me, the verdict is clear: It's great.Works flawlessly in WINE, too.

												""DeathSpank"" is a great little RPG/Hack 'n' Slash game with funny and simple yet interesting story. It has nice cartoon style graphics which just fits perfectly with the colorful world. The atmosphere is really pleasent and the soundtrack is pretty enjoyable while killing creatures. The combat system is fun because it's pretty easy, like the game itself, actually. However, there are some difficult quests which will take you a little more time than usual to beat them. The dialogues are interesting and also, there is a plenty of jokes in them. The characters are interesting, well designed and voice-acted good. Also, there are many items to collect, many weapons to fight with and some delicious food to feed your hungry belly and restore some of your health!Overall, I'd say the game is a little bit childish, but it doesn't matter, because it's super fun. There is also a local co-op and you can invite a friend to play together.+ Graphics - 10/10 Personally, I really like cartoon graphics.+ Story - 7/10 It's kind of a cliche.+ Characters - 10/10 They all have their own individuality.+ Gameplay - 10/10 A variety of quests, with interesting objectives and many other side-tasks.+ World - 10/10 Big map with lots of locations and places to explore.

												This fusion of Diablo-esque adventuring and Sierra-style humor is like an immature adult's show that if you just tone your wits down just right, you'll enjoy every stunning-looking moment of.

												Ahh Deathspank! This game is simply wonderfull!DeathSpank, our hero for this story, is an unstopable dispencing machine of justice and awesome humour!He his THE stereotype hero, defending the weak like orphans and defeating unfair villains like not other.While the game is your typical hack and slash looting game, getting better gear as you go along, the mechanics of combat are solid and fun. Especially when you get special moves type weapons, which allows from stunning all surrounding foes to attacking them while spinning like tornado of blade!!But the combat is only one aspect of the fun that is Deathspank! The best part being the humour! There is a lot of it!From the cheesy or quite witty discussions you have with the different characters from this world to the awesome flavour text on your weapon and armour, very well written text while give you some proper intertainement.So with the combat solid, the story interesting and the epic humour of a hero, there not much stopping you into joining DeathSpank the Vanquisher of evil in his rightous quest!

												Death Spank is a comedic action RPG similar in gameplay to titles like Diablo. While the game has the traditional tropes of equipment upgrades, character skills, loads of loot and lots of button mashing, the depth and complexity of the RPG elements are scaled back to focus more attention on the comedic narrative.Whether or not this results in a positive experience really depends on your sense of humor. Personally I found the whole game extremely fun, never frustrating and quite consistently hilarious, however I can appreciate silly “potty humor” which this game is overflowing with. There is definitely no challenge in this game once you learn the controls, and while I’ve heard some complaints about this, I feel that it was intentional (and rightfully so) in order to make the game more accessible to people not that into typical aRPG ruthlessness and instead is targeting people looking for a title filled with some great writing and comedy.I got this game a long time ago in a bundle and after playing it through to 100% I regretted not giving it a chance sooner.

												Deathspank is a cute little Diablo style action RPG that is based entirely at poking fun at RPG stereotypes. Every line of dialog, every character name, every weapon description, hell, every damn thing in the game is an attempt at some form of humor and while most of it falls flat on it's ♥♥♥ some of it will make you chuckle.Artistically speaking the game is quite nice looking, the graphics are not great but the art style, where everything and everyone is really just a cardboard cutout, fits nicely with the theme of the game. The voice acting is pretty decent although it's hard to judge that in a game where nobody is supposed to sound serious in the first place.Gameplay is where the game is truly lacking though. You click on an enemy to attack with weapon A and right click for weapon B. The weapons and armor is a completely linear progression and rarely require any input from you.All in all, it's a fun little game that you will likely enjoy if you don't expect too much from it.

												Entertaining for a quick game to jump in and out of when you can't commit a ton of focus to something. It is pretty much always amusing and the style keeps the game fresh enough for as long as it is (about 15-20hrs on average I'd guess for normal difficulty). I've tried the standard Diablo and PoE and Torchlight, etc and they are good too, but this game did it's job, did what it wanted to well, then it ended so I can carry on.The only shortcoming I could say is that it is very apparent they intended a nuch more robust enemy/item system, but all the cool potions and elemental items aren't really needed.Now on to Thongs of Virtue...

												Barebones hack & slash with more style than substance.Gameplay boils down to killing things with little variety in what to kill or what weapons to use; no builds or skills to speak of and equipment is pretty much bigger attack for weapons and bigger HP boost for armor, ensuring little replay value.Story is almost nonexistent, with focus on wacky characters and hit-and-miss humor rather than an actual plot.Graphics are fine: no slowdowns, unintrusive UI and ""2D buildings in 3D areas"" style that's somewhat charming.All dialogues are voiced and voice acting is good; music is not as good and often far too repetitive.Overall not a bad game for its pricetag but every one of the 12 or so hours needed to clear the main campaign could be invested in any other game with better gameplay, story or exploration.

												DeathSpank is a thoroughly mediocre action RPG that takes after Diablo but never manages to be all that entertaining.Probably my biggest mechanical issue with the game is the itemization - there's no randomly generated loot, and almost all items are just straight upgrades that require higher levels to equip. The only exception to these are the weapons which allow you to use your Justice Meter, which also have tiered upgrades, but deciding which of them to use is actually slightly interesting - though I found the spinning swords to be the best of them by far, to the point where I didn't really use the others much. This also affects the stores in the game, which have very little worth purchasing until you're level 18 and can just buy the best equipment in the game - before that point, items are far too expensive, don't offer a huge benefit (unless, as it did for me, the game basically refused to ever drop crossbows for you) and will likely be replaced quickly with items dropped by monsters or found in treasure chests.With the itemization out of the way, the game is on the simple side - except for a few difficulty spikes like the Pip Village, I found Normal to basically be walking through the early game and killing everything in 1-3 hits, and later doing it just as fast from range with the crossbow. There's a variety of consumable items, but I only really used the healing items because it didn't seem like I ever really needed any of the others, or had a clear idea of when element resistance potions or whatnot would even have been useful. So, yeah. The combat wasn't terribly interesting, and neither were the rewards for the combat.The parody elements were occasionally amusing, but frequently fell flat for me - that you're going on a set of stupid fetch quests isn't made any better by the game calling attention to how stupid the fetch quests are, for instance. It's one of my gripes about parody RPGs in general, that they frequently seem to think that it excuses replicating bad game design for the sake of parody. Some of the more puzzle-like quests were amusing, however, and weren't something I was used to in this type of game.Ultimately, DeathSpank is the kind of game I would mostly suggest trying if you think its style of humor would appeal to you. It doesn't really stack up well without that. (Unfortunately, it also seems as if DeathSpank never goes on sale any more, from what I've heard? So I can't even really suggest picking it up on the cheap, even though it's over five years old now.)			"

												This is one of the funniest, crudest, best damn time you will have, in a 2d action rpg. I love this series, though, I did not like the fact that eventually the game starts to get so much more difficult as you get to the mid to higher levels. Now I am not so wimpy that I cannot handle a challenge, but in some areas, you will be swarmed by enemies, some or all of which are tough enemy types, such as the tough mother spider types (it has been a while since I played so I forget a lot of the enemies) and the Jotuns. Yes, they will have minion types with them that just die in a few hits, but then you get swarmed by a bunch of regular spider types or jotuns or demons or w/e, and you are toast.Now, maybe I am missing something, and there is a trick to it to avoid getting swarmed like that and dying, a lot. But for me, if I die too many times, then it is no longer fun for me. I am not saying I don't like challenging games, I do, I just hate dying every 5 minutes or so, or dying until I figure out the secret... I am in no way saying that makes this game bad, it doesn't, I am saying I am probably a bad player. If you are a fan of crude humor, hilarious plot lines and quests, and hilarious weaponry and quest rewards and action RPGs, then this is your game. If not, or if you are like me and are not a fan of dying, a lot, then this may not be your game, still worth looking at though, to see if you will like it.			"

												If Diablo was a comedy you would get deatspankA brilliant underrated game Simple graphics with a very nice style that compliments the playstyle perfectly.Easy to use and easy to master controls for both controller and keyboard (i've noticed a lot of the time it can be either 1 or the other rarly both) Amazing dialogue that never leaves you bored and will make you chuckel several times (not nessicarily hilarious but highly amusing)If you've ever played torchlight or Diablo you should get to grips with deathspank very quicklyNow ive sung its praises but even a game like this has its faults.A couple of the enemies it expects you to fight early on are a little unfairly strong (i.e the pip's who can kill you in 1 hit) and can be very annoying and makes you feel for a moment like you need to grind up ( which you dont just use ranged attacks and eat )the time it takes before you can move after teleporting was a huge problem for me as it kept throwing me out of the immersion i was in.Overall i give this game a recommend and 4 out of 5			"

												Fun short game, managed to finish it in 10 hours after checking every single side quest possible and seeing if I missed any passage.But let's get to the general review.Graphics: 8 This game has a pleasant graphics, although nothing overly special. It fits greatly the game style.Gameplay: 8Fun, quick, simple. Hack and slash all your way through hordes of enemies with little consequences. Sadly the game goes only up to level 20, and ends with a rather open ended end so...Replayability: 6Weak point of the game, is that once you did it all...there is nothing left to do. At most, you could attempt to restart the whole game trying to play it in the hardest difficulty setting, but nothing else. If only the ""good/evil"" bar actually did work and changed dialogues and stuff, it would had been more interesting with plenty of reasons to start all over again.Fun: 9I was throroughly amused through the whole game, with each NPC having something funny to say. Side missions, and even the main story has been quite funny, and it's hard to get tired of the simple hack and slashing of the game. Been a while since a game made me smile that much. The hint system works great as anti-frustration device too.Side note: DARN IT, WHY IS THE K RUNE MISSING?Final vote: 8A fun game for anyone that loves humor, fantasy settings, and smashing through waves of enemies.

												Very funny dialogue in this game.  Totally reminds of ""The Tick"" and Big Blue Justice!!!Had me laughing out loud to start with, but did get old, but still humorous after playing through to finish the game.The controls and use of all of the XBOX type control options are done well. Game flows and is pretty easy up until the final battle.  Funny desctiptions of all of the wepaons and other items in the game as well.  Battles became a little monotonous, but didn't detract too much from the game as it goes by quickly.  Very good game that I highly recommend to fans of Tick type humor.			"

												Fun action RPG. Lots of interesting quests to do which is nice. All the characters are fully voiced too. Graphics are crisp and works fine with the 360 controller. Couple things that kind of irritated me was the main characters voice- he sounds like Captain Quark from Ratchet and Clank and while its ok at first by the end of the game i was sick of hearing him speak. Also there is a quest to rescue several children -which is a main story quest- but you cant finish until you do other quests first. Not so bad except the game doesnt tell you this.			"

												DeathSpank is a solid third person action RPG with a lot of ridiculous humor (my kind :)). It's fairly colorful, so don't expect a style similar to Diablo here. Actually, I'm glad it's colorful. It stands out from the rest this way. Anyway, there is loot (just not a whole lot) and there are quite a lot of quests for a downloadable game. The combat is solid and the skills/weapons are decent but not all that spectacular unfortunately. I did have a lot of fun with it though, and you can expect about 8-9 hours of gameplay. So more than enough. By the way, if you like this game, make sure you try out the other Deathspank games as well.[Rating: 78/100]			"

												Deathspank is best played with a controller, in my opinion, without one the controls are a bit weird and sometimes you move in directions you didin't ask to. It took me about 7 hours to beat the game and I felt bored about 30 minutes during that time, because I had no idea where to go in a certain quest. It's a pretty casual game execpt for 1 or 2 monsters in particular which are quite unbalanced and can cause problems.That game is very hard to review, because, while I had alot of fun and didin't see the time go by... The gameplay is very repetitive and there's not enough weapon variation and different ''skills'' in the game, in my opinion. Shoot until the monster gets to you, smash, smash, block, smash, block, smash, monster dead... That's what you do for about half of the time.I do believe it's worth playing, because of the dumb humor that's just wrong and funny... Though if you're looking for challenging gameplay or have a bad sense of humor, this game is definately not for you!			"

												A series of that everyone knows and the fourth part which introduced a modern war. Currently it was released remaster of this production. which is not bad but available only when you buy CoD: Infinite Warfare what I think is pathetic. According to me, this is one of the best CoD's that you can buy. The game is designed in most for the multiplayer gameplay but the main campaign is very good but short, as it always happens with these games. Online game lasts for many hours of fun, however, as once the game was a lot of dynamic now it is about hiding in the corners and wait for the kill. There is not a lot of weapons but it's good because we do not have to check every weapon that suits us. Modes are pretty cool, standard nothing outstanding. In the game there are different kinds of perks that will improve our game for example, faster reload. And if it was not enough in the internet you can find servers with zombie mod which are really cool. I think it's great production from which I have many pleasant memories. Many hours once I lost and so far nothing has changed so much that it is a little less players and there is not that much cheaters in game. Definitely worth it to go back to the game for those few hours to play with friends. "

												Meh, couldn't be bothered.  Sure, chuckled through some of Deathspank's lines, but the game wasn't there.  Action RPG, wield weapons in both hands, armor auto-equips, minimal ranged abilities means you get plinked to death by the enemy archers, when you die and ressurect you only get minimal health back, lots of time spent eating food to regain health.  Interesting art style makes the world seem like placing a LEGO minifig on a beach ball, so you can have instances where the enemy is over the horizon.  An important note is that this is one game for the price of three, as the story is divided up across the two sequils.			"

												I've played it for a few hours but even before the first hour ended I just instinctively knew that this game looked a bit awful and would become very monotonous! It quickly gets boring and repetitive. It is only a slight parody of other action RPGs like Diablo & Torchlight but even these hardcore examples are better and Torchlight's cartoonish visuals LOOK A WHOLE LOT better than the art style of Deathspank, which isn't that great to look at. There is NO story to speak of and it's full of fetch quests and even the humour is low-rate (I have NOT laughed at any of the subtle joke inserts in-game!). There are plenty of better ARPGs to try, so forget about Deathspank. There are plenty of better examples with much nicer & more realistic graphics available out there like Sacred, Titan Quest, Loki and Grim Dawn! I'm going to uninstall it enthusiastically. "

												I can't remember when i bought this game, or why. What i do remember is that about four hours in i was bored out of my mind and another five hours later i coulden't take it any more. Shure the humor is pretty good in this game, but after a while it gets onboxious and irritating.The same goes for the gameplay, something that is fun at first soon becomes very grindy and a bit confusing. It looked way more fun in the videos than it really was. I'm shure alot of people liked this game, but I could not force myself to play it thru to the end.			"

												This is a fairly compelling game - somewhat like Diablo, but faster-paced and with a little more timing involved for blocking and charged-up special attacks.The humour is a bit campy: the questgivers often less than noble, the hero Deathspank well-meaning and heroic but often clueless, and the outhouses a fast-travel system whose details Deathspank does not want to share.There's enough variety, items and progress that It can actually be a little hard to stop playing, so judge accordingly :)			"

												DeathSpank is a joy to play. The comedy is great. The items, quests, and other mechanics aren't overly complicated and make this RPG a lot of fun. There are a lot of side quests to complete (I think around 115 quests total including main/side quests) and you'll want to finish all of them. It's mixture of cartoony 3D and 2D graphics around a curving world is a nice change from typical RPGs. It's also shorter than many others, as it can easily be 100% finished in 10-12 hours. Which, to me, isn't a bad thing at all. It isn't too short, and it isn't so long that you get bored and burned out by the end.If you're a fan of RPGs, I definitely recommend it.			"

												Oh boy, where to begin.For starters, I recommend you know what you're buying before you buy it. The reason is because this game has terrible, drawn out fetch quests, a very strange difficulty curve,  lackluster coop, and meh graphics. So, after all that ♥♥♥♥ I just gave this game, why is it still ""Recommended?"" I'll tell you why, this is game funny as ♥♥♥♥. The humor is literally the only thing that kept me going, especially the item descriptions. It only makes sense, seeing as it was made the the mind behind ""Secret of Monkey Island"" Ron Gilbert. Overall, it's pretty fun, but the only reason you'd ever buy it is for some great laughs. Also DeathSpank's voice is great.			"

												The reviews for this game all gush at the humor and jokes and they are all right. This game is actually hilarious throughout whether it's a Peter Griffin-style quip or shooting chickens out of a handheld cannon. The quests are the standard kill/collect format but the premise behind them is often so creative and hilarious that it completely makes up for the lack of innovation. There are tons of weapons and armor to find although the majority of what you will use is gotten through quest rewards. The art style is as perfectly stylized as Psychonauts and even the music feels distinctly Deathspank. This game might just be worth full price so if you want a solid action rpg I definitely recommend it.			"

												Deathspank is loaded with fetch-quests, sometimes to a ridiculous extent. One quest giver sends you to the same place, to fetch one item at a time, at least a half dozen times. It's obviously tongue-in-cheek, but the irony wouldn't wear so thin if it didn't apply to most of the game. Also, it's sometimes unclear what you are supposed to do. You will probably find yourself hitting the online guides two or three times. I wouldn't recommend it for a hard core RPG or action player. However, Deathspank is a solid, funny local coop game if you play with someone younger, and it works much better with the gamepad than first-person games do. My seven year old had a blast playing it with me. If you are okay with exposing a kid to cartoonish violence and some mildly crude humor, and don't feel an obsessive need to slogh through every sidequest, you should give it a shot.			"

												DeathSpank is a joy to play. The comedy is great. The items, quests, and other mechanics aren't overly complicated and make this RPG a lot of fun.

It's mixture of cartoony 3D and 2D graphics around a curving world is a nice change from typical RPGs. It's also shorter than many others, as it can easily be 100% finished in 10-12 hours.

												I love Deathspank. It's fun, it's witty, and it's so self-aware that it'll make your brain hurt sometimes. This game flows really well. There aren't any clunky or unwieldy elements, and you will move along merrily from quest to quest without having to do many of the annoying dungeon crawler tasks- like selling off vendor trash. The interface is sleek and the combat is intense, and Deathspank himself may be the most awesome cliched hero tough guy ever. The only thing bigger then Deathspank's jawline is how big the dent in the floor will be after you fall over laughing. Oh and play the sequel too, since it's more of a Part 2 to this game then a sequel, per se.			"

												Deathspank is loaded with fetch-quests, sometimes to a ridiculous extent. One quest giver sends you to the same place, to fetch one item at a time, at least a half dozen times. It's obviously tongue-in-cheek, but the irony wouldn't wear so thin if it didn't apply to most of the game. Also, it's sometimes unclear what you are supposed to do. You will probably find yourself hitting the online guides two or three times. I wouldn't recommend it for a hard core RPG or action player. However, Deathspank is a solid, funny local coop game if you play with someone younger, and it works much better with the gamepad than first-person games do. My seven year old had a blast playing it with me. If you are okay with exposing a kid to cartoonish violence and some mildly crude humor, and don't feel an obsessive need to slogh through every sidequest, you should give it a shot.			"

												Its silly, outrageous, down right goofy and does not take itself seriously in the slightest. And thank the heavens it doesnt! In a world where we see nothing but dark, overly pretentious or just trying to be as sesnible as can be its refreshing to play a game that says ""hey I'm just here to have fun and a right laugh care to join?"". Right up to its very title DeathSpank is nothing more than a bag of goofy jokes, quirky characters, simple clicky combat and a very easy leveling systems (you pick a card at each level that boosts one thing and thats it!) its there for those of you who dont want to have a brain fart over trying to understand overly complicated stories or who for the evening just dont want to have to shiv through the grind to get to the good bits.

												The Deathspank series and 'On the Rain Slick Precipice of Darkness' 1 and 2 are all cartoon like games with, first and foremost, lots of fun dialogues. I got the first Precipice game in a bundle and just gave it a try, then after finishing bought the others. These are all great games, I love the 2D artwork and the way the whole thing is put together. For instance, mall details like when you switch weapons you see Deathspank wielding it in the preview (I know this is common among the bigger game developers but for a relatively unknown game maker it is nice to see that they created a finished rather than a rushed product) . Unfortunately the screenshots alone do not do these games justice since you are not aware of the funny dialogue (if the first game wouldn't have come with the bundle, I bought, I probably wouldn't have tried them at all).Deathspank is secondly a hack and slash. Although you die rather frequently (ok, I die rather frequently :-) ), you will just respawn close by so it isn't such a big deal. Personally I have set it to the easy setting and then it should be playable by anyone, I think.I really love all of these games and finished ORSPD 1 and 2 twice (note that I didn't play ORSPD 3 and 4 because these are different kind of games with retro graphics)  and Deathspank 1 once. I would recommend any of them if you enjoy a not so serious game with lots of fun dialogue.			"

												I have mixed feelings for Deathspank. It's very obvious it's from an Indie developer; the controls are kind of odd, but you can rebind them, or just ignore them like me and hack and slash your way to over 200k damage taken (no death statistic is terrible). The fact that you can't actually turn off click-to-move except while holding down a key is awkward. The music gets repetitive after a while, and it might get confusing as to where to head next. And the questing system is just your generic boring questing system. But where Deathspank shines most is the dialogue, oh my God. Even most item descriptions are pretty random and humerous. The graphics are pretty nice too, I like them, and I also like the very original enemy types (Kangamoos, Bearalopes, and Sabretooth Donkeys come to mind). Dragons look kind of strange, more like reptilian orcs than anything else, but all the others are just amazing and perfect. If you like randomess and don't mind subpar mechanics, you'll enjoy this a lot.			"

												Deathspank is a game that isnt suppose to be serious. With enemies like kangamoos and saber-toothed donkeys, it pretty much explains it all. The dialogs in this game is mostly hilarious with the classic ""everybody is dumb"" jokes. Yes, deathspank is dumb and i love it! I have countless times laughed at his dumb comments and it never gets old! And the people that speaks to Deathspank is sometimes just as fun!The game got cartoonish 3d graphics with 2d elements and it looks very cool. The sound, the art style, the atmosphere, it really makes you smile!Its a simple game really, you get your main important quests and you get your secondary less important quests while you slay all possible kinds of enemies to make your way through the different areas to complete them. Tons of weapons and sometimes funny looking armors to choose. Well, you dont really choose because you always take the best armor and weapon but they all look different at least and have different powers. The fighting is basic you either slash them or you shoot them and they drop plenty of loot. You can also block and while youre leveling up you can boost your skills a bit.At first the game holds a very high funfactor but was a bit rushed at the end. Which means that 1/4 of the map is basically landscapes with barely no new quests to find. It ends really fast, just one final bossfight and then youre finished. And the funny dialog gets slimmer further on by the same reason that it was rushed. But the story all in all is very fun and you never get tired of the bragging hero Deathspank and all you want is more of this already hilarious game!			"

												One of my favourite hidden gems from the PS3. Deathspank is a short, charming Action RPG parody with a pop-up book aesthetic. Combat revolves around building combos and executing crits by attacking with three weapons at the same time. The controls are tight and it feels good with either keyboard/mouse or a controller. Deathspank is a good choice for anyone that enjoys ARPGs, but doesn't want the lengthy time investment that comes with the genre. "

												This game is a lot of fun. I think it would be considered a casual RPG with great voice acting (which you can skip). On Easy Mode, there doesn't SEEM to be any penalty for dying (other than enemies regenerating all HP and dropping some money), which means you aren't as likely to get very angry and ruin the experience of ""playing"" a game.I can load this game up pretty fast and doesn't seem slow down at all and works great with an XBOX One USB PC controller (once you check the box on the configuration so it makes the controller Player 1 (instead of keyboard as 1 and player 2 as controller).This is a really fun game for me, because I can quickly load the game and grind levels and do quests and it auto-saves on exiting the game. It's a great way for me to wind down after a long day when I don't have much energy and don't want to invest several hours in learning how to ""start playing"" a game. You kill things, loot and walk around, very simple.The only annoying part of the game I know of so far after 7 hours of gameplay, is that AFTER you ""teleport"" to an area, they seem to glue you to the ground for a little bit and after that they do an animation, before letting you control your character again. I would prefer if I could just instantly move as soon as I have teleported to my chosen area, but it's a minor complaint, and they MAY have done it to guarantee no stuttering from letting you walk before stuff is loaded (but I really think they just want to make sure you watch that animation).I look forward to continueing to play this game every night for a while.

												Deathspank is an action/adventure role-playing game with sense of humor that's similar to older superhero cartoons/comics/games (think Spiderman & Freedom Force).Pros:+ Graphic style / different kind of ARPG mechanic+ Unique setting and unique locations you get to explore+ Soundtrack + SFX+ Voice acting+ Progress is fun overall. New dialogue adds a lot to it and there are many weapon combinations you can use.Cons:- Not much to do for 2nd player in co-op- 1-Hitting enemies that can be hard to spot (or know of when it comes to giants) before it's too late. - Sometimes in tight walkways enemies could block me from escaping (even suddenly lagged and appeared behind me).- Some enemies have attacks that make it hard to know when to perfectly block them. - No way to immediately exit dialogue- You can't equip items with lower overall stats than your current ones. The game forces you to get rid of them.- The game has a lot of fetch quests where you backtrack a lot.. pair that with the same walking speed you always have and it's not very nice.8/10			"

If you like to burn time by killing chickens, orges, and going on never-ending ""unimportant"" sidequests. Then this game might be for you. Or you can just go straight to the end of the story, but by doing the sidequests, you lvl up faster, which really helps with the battles you will have to do. Also, I recomend a controller. 8/10			"

												""So I hear you are good at killing the dead!"" :PSimple combat, questing and role playing... but loads of fun! Quirky sense of humour, and some nice satirical twists to the usual action RPG elements! :)Looks awesome in stereo 3D too! :D			"

												I had a lot of fun with this game! It was weird odd and the quests were actually fun to do.  The ending was wonderful as well.  I certainly say this game kept me going until I finished it, I was dissapointed however to hear the second game has a major bug they never fixed! :(So, long story short, if you want a cartoonishly fun and rude game, I say this is it! So long as you are not looking to get the second game.  I would love to, and I plan to, IF I hear it finally got fixed!			"

												A nice, cartoony aesthetic allows this game to propel itself above your usual hack and slash flare, allowing a well realized world to slowly but surely drawn you in.  The good things don't end there because the game appeals to your 'gotta catch 'em all' inner voice. A foray into a side mission yeilds two hours doing nothing BUT side missions, all for the delicious, delicious loot. Helping things along is the awesomely satirized hero, deathspank.  Refreshingly, he amont of bad jokes only add to his OMG-he-is-painfully-funny-but-still-I'm-laughing persona. In fact the game is a welcome break from the all too serious world of gaming (these days). Cleverly placed puns + wink and nudges make for an enjoyable game. Like shrek the games pokes a lot of fun at it's origins, right down to the naming of it's loot.But please, play this in coop, seeing other people almost come to fisticuffs after an eye opening failure of a base attack is an event in itself.For a 10 hour ride, it's worth the money			"

												The Deathspank series and 'On the Rain Slick Precipice of Darkness' 1 and 2 are all cartoon like games with, first and foremost, lots of fun dialogues. I got the first Precipice game in a bundle and just gave it a try, then after finishing bought the others. These are all great games, I love the 2D artwork and the way the whole thing is put together. For instance, mall details like when you switch weapons you see Deathspank wielding it in the preview (I know this is common among the bigger game developers but for a relatively unknown game maker it is nice to see that they created a finished rather than a rushed product) . Unfortunately the screenshots alone do not do these games justice since you are not aware of the funny dialogue (if the first game wouldn't have come with the bundle, I bought, I probably wouldn't have tried them at all).Deathspank is secondly a hack and slash. Although you die rather frequently (ok, I die rather frequently :-) ), you will just respawn close by so it isn't such a big deal. Personally I have set it to the easy setting and then it should be playable by anyone, I think.I really love all of these games and finished ORSPD 1 and 2 twice (note that I didn't play ORSPD 3 and 4 because these are different kind of games with retro graphics)  and Deathspank 1 once. I would recommend any of them if you enjoy a not so serious game with lots of fun dialogue.			"

												Diablo, with a very Earthworm Jim / The Tick styled sense of humour. The looting isn't all that great, with pretty much no randomness, but Deathspank himself is GLORIOUS.			"

												I love everything about this game.  Its hilarious, the voice acting for Deathspank and the side characters is really well done, I truely wish I could get the voice actor for DeathSpank to do my outgoing voicemail message.  Bascially, you run around and pound the crap out of bad guys while upgrading your equipment so you can pound more crap out of badder enemies.  At no point did I feel like the enemies got so difficult that my weapons sucked.  I was always getting better ones wtih more devastating JUSTICE.  I played the 2 sequels as well, 2 is pretty good, but I didnt like 3 (the baconing).  The orginal Deathspank is a classic tho, it deserves an award for best low budget game ever.			"

												If you've ever killed time (or had time kill you) playing Blizzard's Diablo series, or enjoyed the witty repartee of the colorful cast from Monkey Island, then this is undoubtedly the game for you! Hours of point and click hacking and slashing, imbued with viciously delicious humor and a touch of bacon.			"

												Deathspank is a game that isnt suppose to be serious. With enemies like kangamoos and saber-toothed donkeys, it pretty much explains it all. The dialogs in this game is mostly hilarious with the classic ""everybody is dumb"" jokes. Yes, deathspank is dumb and i love it! I have countless times laughed at his dumb comments and it never gets old! And the people that speaks to Deathspank is sometimes just as fun!The game got cartoonish 3d graphics with 2d elements and it looks very cool. The sound, the art style, the atmosphere, it really makes you smile!Its a simple game really, you get your main important quests and you get your secondary less important quests while you slay all possible kinds of enemies to make your way through the different areas to complete them. Tons of weapons and sometimes funny looking armors to choose. Well, you dont really choose because you always take the best armor and weapon but they all look different at least and have different powers. The fighting is basic you either slash them or you shoot them and they drop plenty of loot. You can also block and while youre leveling up you can boost your skills a bit.At first the game holds a very high funfactor but was a bit rushed at the end. Which means that 1/4 of the map is basically landscapes with barely no new quests to find. It ends really fast, just one final bossfight and then youre finished. And the funny dialog gets slimmer further on by the same reason that it was rushed. But the story all in all is very fun and you never get tired of the bragging hero Deathspank and all you want is more of this already hilarious game!			"

												If you love really funny, non-serious games, you'll love this.If youre into hack and slash games like Torchlight and Diablo, you'll love this.Deathspank is just overall filled with a wacky storyline, really strange characters and bizzare side quests. Really easy to play. Very casual game and is worth paying the $15USD for it. It is needed in everyones steam collection. 10/10			"

												I think the key to this game is knowing what to expect, if you don't expect too much then you can sit back and enjoy the dumb action, laugh at how stupid DeathSpank is and generally have a good ten hours worth of fun.  Don't expect great combat as it's horrifically imbalanced first one way and then the other once you pick up a decent crossbow. Don't expect great loot or interesting leveling because to be honest it's all pretty meh. Do expect to be quitely amused and have the occational giggle at it's good natured humour. Final verdict: worth picking up in a sale or if you've got an awesome friend who will gift it to you then that's even better (Thanks Kitty Cat!).			"
