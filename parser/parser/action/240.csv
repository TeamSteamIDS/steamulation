												why does this cost more than csgo?normal review: this is counter-strike.. you srsly need a review for counter-strike? this is an HD version of CS 1.6 sort of.. meanwhile CSGO is an HD version of CSS.. you can figure out how that works on your own because I have no idea. of course each version has their own differences, some of my classmates say that css is easier to play than cs 1.6 others say that cs 1.6 is better than this and csgo is probably just literally a cosmetic counter-strike..

												If you came here looking for a review, you have come to the wrong place, but if you want some bomb-♥♥♥ brownies, you have come to the right place. You're welcome for an actual recipe, not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ copy and paste pie recipe. Trust me nothing goes wrong with nutella.INGREDIENTS:1 c. unsalted butter2 c. sugar1/2 tsp. salt1 c. flour1 c. cocoa powder4 eggs1 (13-oz.) jar Nutella5 Ferrero Rocher candies, unwrapped and crumbledDIRECTIONS:1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.2. Melt butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar, stirring until combined. 3. Remove from heat and add salt, flour, and cocoa powder, stirring to combine. Whisk in eggs, stirring just until the mixture is combined into a batter. Set aside.4. Spray an 8""-x-8"" pan with cooking spray. Pour half of the batter into the pan. Spoon or lightly drizzle most of the Nutella on top of the batter, forming an even layer over the brownie batter. 5. 5. Use a spoon or silicone spatula to cover the Nutella with the remaining brownie batter. (If you pour the batter straight on top of the Nutella, it will sink into the Nutella and combine into one marbled—yet delicious—mess.)6. Bake until the top layer of brownies has browned and set, 28 to 30 minutes. It shouldn’t jiggle when you remove it from the oven. (The toothpick test doesn’t work here, since the toothpick will hit the Nutella layer, making the brownies seem uncooked.)7. Let cool for 15 to 20 minutes, then top with a drizzle of Nutella and crumbled Ferrero Rocher chocolates. Cut into squares and serve.Credits: ★ Billy			"

												If you like FPS a lot, this is a good game for you. I personally can't enjoy it too much as I'm a bad aimer, but there's still other gamemodes out there (Gun game, for example, but those are pretty aim-based as well). I can, however, definitely see what so much people like about this game.So, the conclusion, if you like FPS, are good at it, and don't mind some rage when you die, definitely get this.

VOLVO is so affraid ppl will play it again [css $20 | csgo $15].What can I say but a big bloody L O LGuys seriously, this game is better then csgo, headshotting feels good actually in this game and it is more fun. It is more comic-like game, retro...decent graphics and great gameplay, also communities are relaxed...in csgo everyhting is so serious like omfg i deranked, who cares...it is just a videogame and should be played for fun. Thats why i stick with css, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥et, i dont spend money on skins...i install them for free from gamebanana.com. More over half of the csgo skins are just same thing different colors...in css you have different rifles and 1000s of skins that are custom made and each unique in its own way. Not to say that 60% csgo community servers are cancerous/racist places where you dont make any friends, only butthurt players that spent all their money on gambling skins and feel frustrated....in css you make lots of friends and you actually have fun.If you search good place to play css, check out my servers, www.awpclan.com   we kick azz ;)			"

												Ahh CS:Source.One of my personal faves ever since I was a child.First time I played it was around 2005 but didn't like it that much mostly because everyone was still playing 1.6.Which was at that time at least in my country, at the peak of its glory.Neverless all of that, this game still holds a special place in my heart.Playing many surf maps,zombie maps,deathruns with friends and many more.The body physics were the biggest attraction to CS:S for me.Source's graphics at that time were insane and people were surprised with it.Compared to CS:GO today it's very underrated but what can you do,people change through the years and so does their taste.As I said Source holds a very special place because of many memories I have of it.It already has enough reviews but this one is written purely for respect for this game.Thanks for the memories Valve.Final verdict 10/10 - Extremely recommended			"

												Obama had reformed the elite group Feel Team Six to track down and kill Barracka Bin Bama that had recently assassinated The President's dog (Dog's name here because im too lazy to look that ♥♥♥♥ up). Feel Team Six embarks on a journey all across Iraq, and Afghanistan to find the assassin Barrack Bin Bama. The search soon ends when Feel Team Six discovers Bin Bama has fled to the wasteland Australia otherwise known has ""Nope land"". At that point Feel Team Six had realized that Bin Bama had literally entered hell and decided to launch several nuclear strikes against the country because ""That place is worse than hell...and have you ever been kicked by a kangaroo? That's right, because everyone who has is dead!"" With the nukes Feel Team Six had effectively killed an estimated 23.3 million people. Feel Team Six could only assume Bin Bama had died in the nuclear blast and called it a day.			"

Period.Released in 2004Still playing in 2017I have so many hours in this game, so the 189.1 hours doesn't even do justice, because Steam didn't even track time back when I played a ton. When I started playing, I'm pretty sure Steam was only for Valve games at the time. Crazy to think now it is basically a central hub for almost all PC gaming.Cheers to this game and shaping my life through high school, college, and even till this day.

												Counter-Strike: Source is one of those classic games that don't go away that easily. This game is like the CLIMAX of the CS series since CS 1.4. I bet that most people knew about Counter-Strike because of this game. This game is well-polished, it did have bugs and glitches back then but it's gone after several updates. Even playing with just bots is fun to play (especially putting them on the highest difficulty. Aimbot and all).I still remember those early times of CS:S where you can't choose a ""soldier/mercenary"" to use, like just getting into the game with the same ""outfit"", which is the Phoenix and I think the ST6 (if I'm not mistaken). Also, this game had a shield once. It was fun to use but it was removed from the game.Well, this game might last for decades, I hope. Overall, it's a GREAT game. I can't even like make a minimalistic or a wide review for this game since it's just that good and memorable. Definitely will be played for years.NOTE: Yes, currently I have few hours of this game but I actually played the ""cracked/pirated"" version of it when I was 7, so if I add up all the hours back then and sum it all up with my current hours. I probably have a thousand hours (or almost) of game time (including offline times).If I have wrong grammars and comprehensions or any reactions, feel free to comment on my review. Thanks for reading.			"

												Hello, cheeky chaps! For starters, what's the first thing that comes to mind when you saw this game? That's right, this isn't Call of Duty! This game is Country-Steak: Sauce and yes, it's a dank one, mate. Tesco's finest said so right on the package.First time playing, you're going to get mega wrecked and question yourself, ''How do I quickscope?''. If you're feeling down like the little, fedora wearing scrub that you are, why not get your noob butt popped with a solid, mint-condition bag of Doritos and to cool off your edgy skills with some Mountain Dew? Don't forget to even add in that inaudible dubstep that just adds passion and flare to your MLG gaming experience. If you repeat all of these actions, you just might have the chance to receive a granted entry into FaZe clan or a casting audition for the next special episode of EastEnders. Damn son, how does that sound and where'd you find this? You'll be the face of the MLG jubilee. Scrubs and hackers alike will all be wrecked by your hands, and may just in fact denote you as a cheeky Illuminati ninja, or possibly even a stupid autistic camper. As you can see, you're definitely around the corner from a notorious OpTiC application and a B&Q. By the way, check out my mate, Derrick on YouTube, if he reaches twenty subscribers, he'll do a dank giveaway. But if you don't, I'm afraid you will be eaten by the spooky scary skeletons and brought down to the depths of an Aldi's public urinal.This game has many different servers of I don't bloody know, ducky darling. So, be sure to check them out, mate, or not, I don't give a damn. But please, do not ever lie about what happens to you when you play this game, if you're caught hacking, lose all your weed and fedora and get a VAC ban, it's your fault, you dirty, dragon eating, little s-p-a-s-t-i-c. On a related note, be careful of hackers, not only are they noobs, but they will definitely steal your fresh swag and obey cap in the process.Make sure that there are no snipers creeping behind you, so you can easily deck them in their heads, with your mighty yet cheeky, 360 no' handscope, pimp slap, as you're followed by the blinding lense flare. The mechanics, noscopes, hardscopes and of course, the precious quickscopes in this game are so amazing, that it'll leave you screaming, ''Mum, get the camera!'' with joy, enthusiasm and adrenaline, as you easily hook all your opponents in their puny little gabbers. You're now the star with the inevitable saying, ''Watch this, lads.'' followed by only the kills a CoD global elite sniper could pull off. with every euphoric game that passes by, be sure to treat yourself to a quick blaze of a dank blunt, right around 4:20pm, with a wee giggle, typing in the Doritos, crust-infested keyboard, ''gg lads no re.'' never leave it as, ''sample text.'' As it will only just make them more edgy and make them beg for your Steam login as well as full access to your memes. Poopy hackers, don't talk crap to me online, or I'll ban you, my dad works for Colgate toothpaste.By the way, did I mention this game is great?This was brought to you by Tesco's everyday value tomato soup, with special thanks to Kelloggs' cereal for the weed flakes to help me write this review. They're so great, mate, only 20p each. Haha, Asda once tried to bribe me to not write my reviews, what a packet of Hob-knobs. Subscribe to my flaming channel, old chap, for Pete's sake and remember to give this review a like so my Nan's dead soul can finally rest in pepperoni, after getting shanked outside Sainsbury's.On a final ending note, got any crisps?

												Even after 5000 hours I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite game. I started playing the game 2013 on a Zombie mod Server (Elite HunterZ) the best Zombie mod Server I've ever been playing on and since then I only played Zombie mod.After a short time I got interested in Bunnyhopping since it's needed and an advantage as Zombie. So I learned Bunnyhopping on Bunnyhop Servers, really fun and relaxing tho. Else than that I played some surf, joined AWP Servers and Deagle only.  There's actually one thing I really dislike when it comes up to the hitboxes..they just suck. And at least and last my opinion: Counter Strike Source is more dead since CS:GO got out. But just in return, players in CS:S ain't as much toxic as in CS:GO.I met less Cheaters in CS:S than CS:GO and I only played CS:GO for 300 hours at all. Plus you're not going to spend your money for Skins in CS:S. If you want custom weapon skins, get them from Gamebanana.  "

												Counter-Strike: SourceStory - It doesn't have one, but it has tons of servers with different gamemodes and if you play with bots, it's the normal hostage rescure or bomb defuse. I love it. 10/10Storyline Length - As long as you want, but each match shouldn't take you more than 4 minutes.AI - Ruthless. But they can't throw grenades for ♥♥♥♥. 9/10Experience - You'll laugh, you'll rage, you'll yell ""SHUT UP"" at people playing bad music through the ingame voice chat. 10/10Graphics - It's from 2003 or 2004 (i don't remember) so I can't really say anything. But they're pretty good. 9/10Sounds / Voice Acting - You can choose. Between normal radio. And the bot's custom radio. The guns are bloody loud. And at the very end. You'll always hear the glorious ""(Counter) Terrorists Win!"" 10/10Controls - Just. Easy. You can learn them in literally 10 seconds. 10/10Overall - 10/10It's kinda hard to play multiplayer because everyone's either cheating or are just elites. If you want to go up against noobs, go play CS:GO. Regardless, you'll have a great time playing this game, playing with bots or with real people. No Steam Library is complete without this beautiful game.			"

												Counter-Srike: SourceWell first of all, I played this first time ever just recently, I know I missed the old good CS:S times, better later than never, right? Everyone who has played Counter-Srike games knows how this game works, but something I have to say. This is a bit easier than Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and a lot easier than Counter-Strike 1.6. The community in this game is pretty nice towards others, I have to say that. Playing this on community servers like zombie hunting etc is really fun. This game is just so good, it has no over rated skins etc. It's made just to be played. I can not say anything negative about this, it is so perfect. My grade for this game is 9,5/10			"

												Counter-Strike has come a long way and to see this game really brings out how much it has come. I feel as this game is not just a time waster but a reason to still be on the Internet. But In 1999, I crawled out of Counter-Strike’s wretched ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to become the man I am today. And, now, I’m tasked with rating the game. How does one even rate his mother?In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class. Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS (nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept!) It was more than a game. It was my social hub, my iTunes visualizer, and my brief entryway into game design (which didn’t go very far.) It is and remains a standout multiplayer shooter that paved the way for things to come with Call of Duty and Battlefield.Being eight years since the excellent Source remake, Valve has decided it’s time to give the game another facelift. What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive, it is without a doubt a reboot. Valve has just hit the reset button on the series, once again. As drastic and premature of a maneuver it may be, there is no denying that Counter-Strike remains an addictive and rewarding competitive shooter like no other.In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class.

												Counter-Strike: Source did me wrong. Lost my life to this game, there was never a situation where I wasn't happy playing this game. You'll meet people on here that are better friends then the ones you have been friends with for your whole damn life. You won't be able to maintain any contact with the outside world you will lose everyone, and yet. You. Will. Not. Give. A. Single. FiretrUCK. You will lose your virginity to this game and no one can give you a better gift then having a video game as your first for everything. Because hell everybody knows you're not ever going to get the chance to 'do it' again. You will think of this game every moment of your life from the time you start playing it when you're sleeping, when you're eating, when you're brushing you're teeth, when you're taking a doozie, and especially when you're masturbating. In fact it will be the primary reason that you masturbate. This game is so damn good its wankable, FiretUCKable, and vegetable. Good s**t man. Good s**t. Remember to be healthy so you can continue playing this game for years to come and be sure to drink your  ovaltine!			"

												Counter Strike: SourceThis is one of my favourite games right now. I use it to get textures for Garry's Mod and Sometimes i play this game.Some good stuff about this game:-It has good sounds-Has very good bot AI-Is cheapBad things:-no ranks (makes it harded for new players)That's all i can say.The game is better than CS:GO in my opinion. You don't have ranks so you can play with players that are better than you. When you see a smurf it's not a smurf in this game it's a normal player, because there are no ranks. There are less hackers in this game and it's just perfect.I hope this review found helpful, or not.			"

												Its hard for me to review this game, becouse i really dont know if this is better than 1.6. They are both amazing games that allows the players to continue changing their experiences. Custom maps, skins, mods, i had so much fun playing this game... zombie,surf, jail, fy maps, the classics, i have tons of memories in this game. Global Offensive will never be better than this, trust me. The gameplay here is much more ""Counter Strike"" than GO. The graphics are obvsiouly oudated, but they are still good using the Source engine. If you read my GO review, you will see why i dont like Global Offensive : Valve. Yep, in my opinion Valve is ruining this franchise with the whole ""pay the game then pay more for skins"" to fully ""enjoy"" the experience. Thats why 1.6 and Source were more enjoyable than GO, becouse you buy the game and you dont have to pay more. If you want skins, download for free it or just build one yourself with the right tools. Source praises criativity, while GO praises CASH. While the ""Competitive"" mode introduced in GO make people think that the game is more serious now, it really isnt. There were professional championships in Source and 1.6 also. Therefore, Counter Strike became a classic that continues to shine everyday and will keep shining forever ;)			"

												Counter-Stike: Source is a game made by Valve and is a remake of the original Counter-Strike. I got this game on sale with the Source Multiplayer pack. This was my first game into the legendary Counter-Strike series.Pros:+ADDICTING Gameplay - This is what makes all CS games so fun. From the pluse pounding seconds of defusing a bomb with Terrorists hot on your tail, or the intensity of being the last man standing outnumbered by the opposite team where every move you make will determine whether you will clutch or be kicked.+Well Balanced guns - All the guns in this game are well balanced. Guns like the AWP or DEagle give you power but reduce your speed or mag size. All guns are good, you just need to master them+Fun Maps - All the maps in CS are fun. All maps are well balanced and don't really give one team an advantage over the other. +Community Maps - The Community maps are easy to access and a lot of fun.Cons:-...Overall, (10/10) CS: Source is a really fun game. This game will give you endless hours of fun, love, pain, and glory. Also, the game runs smoothly on my PC. If your PC can't run CS GO, then this is a great alternative.			"

												Counter Strike Source is a first person shooter game  that simply everyone should had played  its the basic *Easy Version of counter strike global offensive *  In Counter strike source the recoil is less and easier to hit and the deagle is just amazing  had much fun playing on zombie servers surf servers and some pcw   this is a game that was worth to buy  no money lost in the game, so if counter strike global offensive was to hard for you Counter strike source is the game for you =)Its still alot of servers to play on even if the game starting to be *Old*Decent hit detections  much better then cs go =)			"

												★ ★ ★ ★ -One of the greatest online multiplayer FPS games of the old and also most of the current generations, there is a single player mode to do a standard match with bots but the true value in this game is freely mod-able community servers, which has kept the game alive and feeling fresh to players for ages, i'd give it 5 stars but the only thing is its lacking in value if you dont have an internet connection all the time.            You can spend hours and days on end looking through the list of servers running all kinds of game modes, Jail Break, Gun Game, Zombie Escape, Zombie Riot, Surf, to name a few and even some servers that dont have anything to do with shooting, like MiniGames servers where its a course you have to maneuver through without falling.           Garrys Mod is an adaptation to CSS mixed with a little HL2 so if you like the other Source Engine games then CSS is for you, CS:GO has community servers as well but with all the hype of the ""matchmaking"" modes nobody even looks at the Mod servers, so if you like the gameplay change of community servers then CSS is for you, but if you like the standard style multiplayer matches like in Call of Duty then you probably wanna go for CS:Global Offensive.           I used to run an old laptop with a 2.14 Ghz single core AMD Sempron CPU and an AMD Radeon 4200 with 320MB with a 2x2 ft box fan on my table to cool the laptop, so if your systems a little better you should run things fine on all low settings as long as your system doesnt get too hot, and remember that with laptops and gaming heat is always your enemy.

												Ok, here are your options. You can buy this package and get three multiplayer games. Or you can buy the retail version of Half Life 2 and get Counter Strike:Source, Half Life 2 Deathmatch, and the story version of HL2. Basically, with this package versus HL2 retail, you will be trading the story version of HL2 for the multiplayer game Day of Defeat and whatever price difference there is.Now with that out of the way, I'd assume you are looking at this page because you are interested in Counter Strike: Source. Good choice. There is a reason CS:S is the number one online game in the world. The game is amazing......it's that simple.The game is set up around the premise of Terrorists vs. Counter-Terrorists. When you first join a server you choose which side you want to be on, the main difference being the weapons you will have access to. During the game each team has a different goal. One some levels the Terrorists have to plant a bomb while the Counter-Terrorists try to stop them. On other levels the Counter-Terrorists try to rescue some hostages while the Terrorists try to stop them. During each round you get 1 life. That's it! This means if you die you have to sit around and wait until the round is over. It's not a big deal though, the levels are generally small and well designed, and rounds don't usually last very long. Some of the positives of this system are that it discourages ""Rambo"" type play where people will just run around with guns blazing, of course some people still do that, but most people are more concerned about being careful with their life.The graphics in this game are amazing! All the particle, smoke and water effects are extremely well done. There is a reason the Source graphics engine is so popular and it shows in this game. If you don't have an up-to-date computer you may have to sacrifice some visuals for performance, but the Source engine scales quite well, so as long as you aren't years behind you should be able to find settings that work.A heads up to any parents up there, there is a good amount of blood in this game and obviously it is centered around shooting other people, so you may want to keep that in mind if you are purchasing for a kid.Now we move on to the actual gameplay. I already touched on the one life per round aspect of this game, but as a new player you should be prepared to die...... a lot! You will die over and over and you will never kill anyone. That is a fact, and if you are going to buy this game it would serve you well to just accept that right now. Having played First Person Shooters in the past will help a bit, but you will still be nothing but a bullet absorber when you first start out. The learning curve on this game is a bit steep, and there are many people out there who have been playing this game for years. They have the aiming system down to a science and know every level like the back of their hand. There is also a little weapon called the AWP, which is a sniper rifle you will get to know very well. Mainly by the amount of times you are killed by it. This is a one shot one kill weapon and there are some players out there who simply don't miss with it. Suffice to say it can be quit frustrating when you are constantly killed from 200 yards while you barely get a chance to even see who shot you.The point of all this is that it will require a bit of patience to learn this game and get to a skill level where you can be competitive. There is a neat little option where you can start your own server and fill it with ""bots"", which are computer controlled characters, and use this as practice. You can even set the difficulty level of the bots. While no AI can compete with human intelligence this is a good way to get better at the game and learn the levels if you are getting frustrated on real servers.Overall, it's a great game that is being updated constantly with new levels and features. If you can get past the learning curve you will be rewarded with a satisfying online shooter that you will be playing for years to come. If you are easily frustrated and do not want to put in the time it takes to get good at this game you may want to pass on this and try something else.			"

												This game is pretty great. I saw the trailer for it a while back, and was very hyped for it's release. The first thing I noticed while in game, however, was the fact there wasn't horse stealth. However, I did like the guns in this game. The best one being the stick with a scope on it. I think the best way to play this game is by drinking an entire 12 pack of Bud Lite beers. I often like to play this game while making love to my friend's cat while it's eating food out of his ♥♥♥.In all, I'd give this game a .16/7.			"

												You may have read reviews other than mine. Hell, you may even skip mine. You might have done it just now. But, let me tell you something.This game is amazing.There is SO much more to this game then CS:GO.Community is great, there are some REALLY good servers, it is 100% moddable (sounds, gun skins, maps, textures, enbs, etc) Although ENB's are vac bannable it seems. This game feels like a REAL counter strike. No cases, no drops, no stress about finding keys to open that one case. Just shooting terrorists and having fun with your mates.And this is one of the games that I am so glad my friend gifted me.			"

												Most of Counter-Strike: Source players moved over to CS:GO when that got released cause of the superior graphics and the ongoing updates to the game, so css was being left in the dark, but there is still an active community for css. Even tho the game is old and there is a newer version, this one still holds it's charm. With various of game modes there is always something to do in this game. For a game that has been out for 11 years it still has really good graphics and gameplay. If you wan't to play some interesting game modes for Counter-strike i recommend CSS, it has everything basically. except a good matchmaking system to prove your skill. But it is still one of my favorite games of all time.			"

												A game I owned back in 04, pirated when I got hacked and lost my account, this account is the lasted one I made and it just feels good to buy it and play again. I've played 1.6 and Source a lot when I was younger and I really wish I could put more hours into this, alas the future of Counter Strike is shaping to omething different. However when I wake up at 2 am in the morning without any sleeping. I'll get out of bed, power my pc, put on my headset and open up Counter Strike: Source. Just like when I was younger, and meet new people, play competitively, and love every bit of it. This game... aswell as 1.6 will forever hold a special place in my heart.			"

This game will give you a portion of adrenaline if you play against players of similar to your skill. It will make you angry if you play against more skilled players. Would be good to have matchmaking to gather players of similar skill. But it was added into CS:GO only. Original Counter-Strike has some advantages, but worse graphics.			"

												Counter Strike: Source, when I first bought it I thought it would have more gun variety but instead I'm met with some pathetic guns that sound so unrealistic and look like plastic, I know this was made in 2010 but come on, we had the technology to import guns from real life or at least get some good model designers to make it.Another problem I had with this worthless game is that there is no Iron-Sights, this was one of the biggest things I expect from my first person shooter games but again I was met with disapointment that I am unable to make my 720 quick-scope. I was also horribly brutalized by the enemy because I couldn't hide behind a rock and wait for some strawberry jelly to slide off my screen as I got shot, my health didn't regenerate, I mean, what the hell is with that. I expect from modern shooters for my health to regenerate and clearly the developers who blatently are trying to make a bad Call Of Duty rip off couldn't even be bothered to do this. "

												Counter-Strike: Source retains its team-based objective-orientated first-person shooter style gameplay. The aim of playing a map is to accomplish a map's objective: defusing the bomb, rescuing all hostages, or killing the entire opposing team. The ultimate goal of the game is to win more rounds than the opposing team. Once players are killed, they do not respawn until the next round, though this depends on which server people play on. This gameplay feature distinguishes Counter-Strike from other first-person shooter games, where players respawn instantly or after a short delay.Shooting while moving dramatically decreases accuracy, and holding the trigger down to continuously shoot produces severe recoil. The severity of damage induced by weaponry is dependent upon the specific locations of hits, with hits to the head being most lethal and shots which make contact elsewhere causing lesser loss of health. Damage is also affected by the distance, and if the target wears protection.			"

 What is Counter Strike: Source? It is a multiplayer first-person shooter which is a remake of the original Counter Strike that focuses on the teams of Counter-Terrorists against Terrorists, this game includes plenty of maps including some well known maps such as de_dust2 with the gamemode of Bomb defusal and cs_office having the gamemode of Hostage rescue. All of this is put into a competitive environment which involves team-work and skill, unlike other first-person shooters out there. How it Works This game takes quite a bit of skill as said previously, it requires knowledge and understanding of the game. This can mean learning the economics of the game, from nade usage to shooting and compnesating spray control. As you progress you will start to learn these things. Learning is what makes this game longer-lasting and more enjoyable than other first-person shooters. Popular Gamemodes  Bomb Defusal This is a gamemode with the main objective where the Counter-Terrorists try to prevent the Terrorists from planting at either Bomb sites A or B. There are 2 ways that will give you victory, as Counter-Terrorists you can eliminate the enemy team or defuse the bomb before it explodes. When playing as Terrorist you can win doing the same thing as the Counter-Terrorists which is eliminating the enemy team or planting the bomb and letting it explode. Hostage Rescue A gamemode which has hostages that are placed where the Terrorist spawn, same concept with the wiping out enemy team but instead of the Terrorists objective to plant the bomb, it is the Counter-Terrorist to rescue the hostages and take them back to where the Counter-Terrorists spawn. Custom Gamemodes Lastly in Counter Strike: Source you will be seeing a lot of custom maps and servers which make up majority of the servers nowadays. These gamemodes go from minigames to bhop and surf with plenty of other custom gamemodes to chose from. Custom gamemodes are especially fun to play when you are bored or just looking for something to play with your mates. Conclusion Well worth buying it if it goes on sale a little bit cheaper as it is a little old and not worth the $20 at the moment. Worth all the 200+ hours on this game however there aren't as much servers as they use to be because it is getting old and there are mods that are available which are a load of fun to play such as Jailbreak and Zombies. Hands down the best game for its time and maybe even today (at least for me). I do recommend this game to those who are thinking of purchasing it although you better purchase it soon as servers are getting wiped. Although if you are still wanting the Counter Strike Experience you can switch over to CS:GO (Counter Strike: Global Offensive). Its a good alternative but I still prefer Counter Strike: Source over it.9.5/10			"

												One of the oldest, most popular First Person Shooters to ever be created. Counter Strike Source has lived far beyond its projected life-time, and it's pretty easy to see why: A handful of game modes, a community that won't die, a plethora of mods/mod support, low system requirements along with a simple, solid formula for gameplay have all culminated together to help immortalize this game as one of the most successful First Person Shooters to be conceived. A fair warning though: The learning curve on this game is pretty high as those who still play, have been at it for years.			"

												The best CS you could ever play.Almost EVERYTHING is balanced, you can still have a nice movement, some maps are dark and require some light or even nightvision.The competitive scene was very awesome like the one in 1.6 too!It was a pretty underground counter strike, but in my opinion, the BEST one, with lots of gamemodes, OPTIMISTIC engine, since hl2 is a nice engine. It runs in some slow pc's, well, try it out, the game is kinda dead already, but you can still find lots of servers to play in. Even some PUGs (Pick Up Games).			"

												Counter-Strike: Source is a first-person shooter from Valve. This is the next generation of Counter-Strike running on the new Source Engine.With same gameplay mechanic as the previous Counter-Strike, but with better engine. You get the old counter terrorist vs. terrorist gameplay in a round based match, buy weapons and equipments at the beginning of rounds and such with better experience with the new Source Engine.Graphics of Counter-Strike: Source has been greatly improved as the game now use Source Engine. From the textures, models and effects are all improved. The game also now has ragdoll physics that apply to weapons and characters dead body. Each time you kill an enemy, their dead animation will vary and not scripted. And if a grenades explode near a dead body, that body may flown away somewhere. The maps has also been updated to the new engine and look so much better.You'll definitely don't want to miss this one. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

The severity of damage induced by weaponry is dependent upon the specific locations of hits, with hits to the head being most lethal and shots which make contact elsewhere causing lesser loss of health.Now 2014 i dont play this game that much anymore,but sometime is nice when i get on the game with AK grad few kill have some fun and trust i have alot memory in this game :) "

												Hello guys,This is my review of Counter Strike:SourceI've been in love with the Counter Strike series since 1.6, i know the game for a long time and had to get it because its totally worth to get it and play it again.There are few pros but also cons in Source:Pros:Old sounds (Sound better)Your own sprays for free128 TickAlot of fun modes like Surf, Jailbreak and bhopBhopping is alot easier because of the 128 tick servers also goes for surfingStill alot of people are playing CSSKnock stuff like barrels or pallets around the mapBetter hitboxes (*Cough* CS GO *Cough*)Harder BotsAnd of course the old weapons like the MP5 (God i missed this gun)Now after the pros we go to the cons, which are:cons:Almost every server forbids to buy the AWP which is kinda sadServers allow mostly AWP if you buy premium on that serverBuying premium on that server can give you special things like: more HP/Abilities like vampirism and stuff (Talking about unfair play)I totally love CSS but i really think there should be servers with no premium stuff or anything at all.Not only that but servers allow alot of people to join on them and play 20 vs 20 or more which is cool, but you really need to get used to it if you are a CS GO player.20$ for this game is kinda alot but i would buy this game because its fun if you really love the Counter Strike series.I got the game myself from the sale for 6$ with a bundle with CS CZ and CS 1.6.Well hopefully i could give you a good review of the game that i really love to play.I got nothing more to say about it so have fun and have a awsome day.

												I prefer Counter-Strike: Source over Global Offensive anyday, mainly because of the fact that unlike CSGO, custom serverside sounds with stereo spatialization and half of the different entity types and modding/mapping features aren't completely and utterly broken.I'm a modder by nature, and I love tinkering with games, and there's so much stuff you can do with CS:Source as a server owner. Want to turn the game into a Left 4 Dead-style Zombie Apocalypse? You can! Want to make an awesome dismemberment mod with brain matter and ♥♥♥♥ flying everywhere on every headshot? You can. Want to have custom sound effects that make the players make goofy death noises? You can. Sprites? Yep. Screen Overlays/Hud Messages and Elements? Yep. None of this can be done with CSGO without either being half-broken, or crashing the game.If you want variety and a unique gameplay experience from server to server, get CSS. Want the same old ♥♥♥♥ everytime with only minor variation? Get CSGO. Oh, and after the Source 2013 updates for CSS, it has far better hit detection than CSGO.			"

												This was the game that got me into pc gaming, if you like FPS, CSS is the game for you.With the release of CSGO, CSS took a back seat but its still fun to play with your friends, specially Jailbreak, GG and Zombies.I cant really say anything bad about the game itself, maybe about some people that play it, but that happens in every game.9/10. CSS 4 LIFE.			"

												Counter-Strike’s beauty is its simplicity: You play as a terrorist or a counterterrorist on a variety of maps. Once a match begins, you have to either wipe out the other team, free or hold hostages, or defend or blow up bomb sites to win the round. In the six years since its release, Valve has loved and maintained the graphics, sound, and physics engine of its baby, even if it’s not bleeding-edge anymore. Textures are detailed, the vocal work remains strong, nearby bullet-impact sounds still seem as if they’re happening within inches of you, and rag-doll physics still make your character realistically tumble after being hit by a grenade.

												You need this one in your library if you're a FPS fan. It's more than challenging, this isn't one of which you can mess around. This isn't a title that you can simply get on and expect to do well regardless of your playstyle, you need to become good at it. It's competitive, packed with classic maps, and does not reward you as most shooters would (leveling up, unlocking weapons, customization, etc). The reward you get for killing here is the sole feeling of doing something utterly satisfying. This is raw, and it takes guts to pull something like this off this well. Extraordinary job, Valve, 9.0/10.0 "

												What can I say, this game stands the test of time, it's a shooter of all shooter's.Hit detection, hit boxes and movement all solid.Buying weapons very easy to do unlike CSGO where you have this pizza wheel and your re-buy gets deleted but that's a whole other review.Re-buying weapons is easy.If you are new I do recommend playing versus bots because it takes skill, paying attention to radar and sound is a big thing in this game, if you do not you are sure to be dead.Weapons are balanced, people complain about the P90 a lot though if it had 30 rounds it still would be rockin.Maps are nice, people make maps and mods its a big community thing and I do recommend this game 100%Fun for all.  Just stay away from the christian server and TrueGrit, they get sore about anything you say and that ruins the experience.			"

												After a couple of hours I can definitely confirm that once you get addicted to this game, the notion of time just disappears. You launch it one time and then you wake up later thinking about how few years of your life just passed by...10/10, would launch it again.P.S. Actually I played this game for a quite longer time span than you can see since I started playing this game since 2006 and got it on Steam just 4 years later in 2010 so you can add few more thousands of hours of play time. :DThis game is fun to play by itself, but playing it casually doesn't give you the same pleasure and satisfaction (depends on how good you are at this game) as playing it competitively (5v5 matches on mix/pug servers), you just have to try it at least once if you didn't. It's so much more satisfying than doing this in CSGO (1700+ hrs there as well.. duh)...GL & HF!			"

The community is very friendly and helpful to new players, I've never had a negative experience with another person in-game. The Bot AI is stunning, rivaling even the latest Bethesda titles. However, the lack of reasonably priced cosmetic items and paid DLC mappacks really rubs me the wrong way, but that's the only issue I have with this stellar game.			"

												If you are between the ages of three and eight, please read carefully. Owning Counter-Strike: Source is now the only proof that you are not a baby. If you don't have this game, People will think you wear diapers, and cry all the time. Everybody will think you sleep in a crib, and drink from a bottle, if you don't have Counter-Strike: Source.

Defend the bomb away from the hands of the CT.As Counter-Terrorists: You have to kill all Terrorists, or if the bomb is planted, try to find the bomb and defuse it.The community is great, they make mods to change the gamemode, so you can play such as Zombie Survival, Zombie Escape, Surf,..e.t.c..Rating: 11/10 - Best game ever for players want to try some thing new.

You can play as Terrorists or Counter-Terrorists.As Terrorists: You have to plant the bomb. Defend the bomb away from the hands of the CT.As Counter-Terrorists: You have to kill all Terrorists, or if the bomb is planted, try to find the bomb and defuse it.The community is great, they make mods to change the gamemode, so you can play such as Zombie Survival, Zombie Escape, Surf,..e.t.c..Rating: 11/10 - Best game ever for players want to try some thing new.

												While this game is a necessity to have when you buy Garry's Mod, it's not just ""something to get the extra textures for"". The game is actually just as much fun to play as Gmod. I have played CoD for 7 years, and this game is way more fun to play. I rate it 10/10 in my book.			"

												Still active playerbase, even if most players have moved to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.I think CS:S custom gun game mods are more enjoyable than CS:GO's official one. It has most of the stuff that CS:GO has, and is even easier to run. So if you have old PC, and can't run CS:GO, you might be able to run this. If not Original CS it is for you :)			"

												 Valve has taken a large selection of the maps from Counter-Strike 1.6 - Office, Havana, Italy, Aztec, Chateau, Cobble, Piranesi and of course eternal favourites Dust and Dust 2, and recreated them for the source engine. This means all new textures and major aesthetic changes with more complex buildings and scenery. In addition, the levels are scattered with objects that react realistically with the Source engine's physics engine. A rather good game. Graphics and models are satisfactory and there aren't a lot of hackers in this game (as far as I know, but I could be wrong). This game really boosts teamwork abilities in people unlike other games. Personally, I prefer this to CSGO. Believe me, this is worth buying. "

												Hitman Squads, is a crime business game with RPG elements, developed by Infinity Ward and published by EA. It took over 5 years to make, so you know it's good. You play as your custom hitman in a hitman squad. By the way, the game rips of Saints Row: The Menace of Shrek with it's crazy character customization. Anyway, you and your hitman squad to various crimes while trying not to be killed by the police with Sam Fisher nightvision goggles. You'll be doing things like planting bombs in a nuclear plant, holding hostages in an office while holding off the police, and doing a neighborhood heist. The game has an economy system that rips off Payday 2 that lets you buy weapons before going in. For example, you start out with a pistol. By completing missions, you get money. You can spend that money on new weapons and equip- WHY AM I TELLING YOU THIS. Just pay $35 in real life and get the raygun already. The game isn't without it's flaws though. Everytime I beat the mission, I get sent back from the start and I have to do it 12 times in order to progress. Other than that though, the campaign is one of the best I've played. The game is also very unrealistic. The game doesn't let you aim down sights, and when you press Shift to sprint, you WALK instead? What were they thinking? The multiplayer is one of the worst I have ever seen. It's basically the same thing as the single-player, but you get to play as the cops, and you have to buy guns during matches. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING. Why would you play as the cops? That's stupid. Also, the MP9 Silenced SMG is overpowered. YOU CAN STAY OFF THE MINI-MAP. WHAT? Even with all of it's flaws, it's still one of the best games I've ever played, if not the best. This game gets a 9001/10, get Call of Duty Ghosts 43 instead.			"

												Valve's 3rd Counter-Strike game has negatives and positives. The community is still very active and you shouldn't have a hard time finding a server with players. I haven't encountered any major glitches or bugs, and hacking is pretty uncommon. It's easier to learn than CS:GO in my opinion, but you will face many more experienced players. There's no skin garbage either. Unfortunately, there are so many modded servers that it can be hard to find a normal game of CS. Also, there are a surprisingly large number of Russians in the community. This can make it hard to hear teammates since they talk so damn loud. Overall, probably the 2nd best Counter-Strike behind the original. It also includes a limited-time copy to send to a friend. I would reccomend, but keep in mind it is the priciest game in the series.			"

												Unarguably one of my favorite PC games of all times, Counter-Strike: Source is a MUST-PLAY for every PC gamer! Having been played for over 5 years by many, casual and competitive players alike, it's no surprise that this game holds up to this date, and since this mod was made by Valve, makes this ever more of a unique, fun and somewhat balanced experience. This game's straight-forward, teamplay-strategy gameplay is what sets CS:S apart from ""Call Of Duty-esque"" games we see on the market nowadays: it offers intensity to the matches, making each round feel fresh and new. The gunplay is also different, but balanced: no gun is ever the same (obviously), and the in-game money you earn from kills and completing objectives  will make you decide between an expensive AWP and a helpful Kevlar vest. That, and the fact, that this game's mod-friendly increases the replay value considerably, makes you wanting for more Counter-Strike, even after a long hiatus.			"

												Counter-Strike: Source is a great game to play solo or with a group of friends. Counter-Strike: Source provides countless hours of online fast pace FPS action. With custom maps, realistic weapons, custom photo sprays and the ability to have different game mods or styles is what makes CSS one of the best FPS game titles ever. Part of it's success is highly accredited to the original games prior to this verision of Counter-Strike.			"

												What can I say? This game is totally deserving of its reputation and status.It was, if not still is, one of the most popular multiplayer FPS games ever created. If you're a fan of Half-Life 2 and thought the gunplay was lacking, then you will find that Counter-Strike and its family doesn't fall short in the same respect. The game forces you to aim properly and not run around as fast as possible, spraying and praying like an idiot unlike some more ""modern"" FPS games.Quite possibly because the game (and thus, many of its players) has been around for long, the skill level required to successfully play this game is set very high compared to others. Make what you wish of this, but if you're used to hand-holding console FPS games with autoaim, you're going to get fragged a lot. I don't mean this as an insult to console gamers, just a warning.The variety of weapon categories is reasonable, though weapons in the same category can sometimes feel rather same-y, especially in the assault rifle category. You've got pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, assault rifles, battle rifles, sniper rifles and a singular machine gun, the M249. Each of them excel at different ranges and for their lack of significant variance, give a surprisingly different feel in context of accuracy and rate of fire.Although this version of Counter-Strike has been succeeded by Global Offensive, I'd still recommend this game. I haven't played GO so I can't give a properly informed opinion on it, but the overall feel of it looks to me like it isn't really Counter-Strike anymore. Again, just my 2c, you're welcome to disagree for your own reasons.If nothing else, Counter-Strike Source significantly surpasses the original in graphical fidelity. I can't really think of a reason to buy the original over this unless you want to save money or have a VERY old PC which isn't up to the task. Not that Counter-Strike doesn't have its own historical merit for being what I think should be regarded as revolutionary.Overall, if you're looking for a competitive multiplayer experience that will give you great potential to become a skillful FPS gamer, I'd definitely recommend CS:S - so long as you're willing to put in that effort - which unfortunately I'm not, but that doesn't mean I don't still enjoy the game. Even if you get bored of the vanilla game, there's gungame, jailbreak (I think..?), xtreme climb, zombie mod and other little modifications all of which alter the gameplay in surprisingly significant ways for how little of the core game they actually change.

												There is nothing like Counter-Strike in the FPS world. Whether it deals with singleplayer campaigns, to multiplayer battles. Or even a whole war to deal with. Counter-Strike is an old series made by Valve and is currently still inclining with players. People from all around the globe have been wanting or playing this game. Counter-Strike takes FPS Shooters to a whole new level, not just by gunning down people. But to have very unique strategies and working as a team to win. Unlike Call of Duty, this game isn't a spray and run type game. With it's predecessors, counter-strike has grown so well. Let's not forget that it keeps getting more popular and popular. ~ GoddessReviews "

Quite obsolete if you want to play competitively but still awesome if you pick a bunch of friends to explore the different servers and mods.Moreover, it runs on a baked potato. 8/10  (add 1 point if you consider buying it during the sales, it's actual price being pretty scandalous)			"

												Fun, and with very fast-paced gameplay. Enjoyable regardless of how much time a day you have to play it. Graphics are very flexible (they can go from looking very realistic to looking like Quake), and overall the game is simply entertaining, it gives you good times. The only things that really annoy me are the default animations for each weapon, which look pretty...rough, as if they were taken straight from 1.6 without any editing (e.g smoothing the animations).However the game does make up for it with the fact that it's very easy to mod. Once you put in it custom skins or maps of your liking, you're golden! It can give you an even better experience. CS:S is not just a realistic FPS; it can be everything, and you are the one who decides what the game should become with all the kind of mods that exist for it. For example, I'm even using a mod that turns all of the grenades into Rubik's cubes!I recommend it.			"

												Seinfeld is an American sitcom that originally ran for nine seasons on NBC, from 1989 to 1998. It was created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, the latter starring as a fictionalized version of himself. Set predominantly in an apartment building in Manhattan's Upper West Side in New York City (although taped entirely in Los Angeles), the show features a handful of Jerry's friends and acquaintances, particularly best friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander), former girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and neighbor across the hall Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards). It is often described as being ""a show about nothing"", as many of its episodes are about the minutiae of daily life.			"

												Whoo, CSS, my favorite of the series.I'll have to say, its gunplay is probably the best out of them. I know, I know, to some, it might feel like its too easy. But no, I think you still have to worry about recoil and such. Plus its just Counter-Strike with the Source engine, the only difference is that some maps from 1.6 didn't make it in and there are some new maps (that also happen to have not been carried over to GO.)Both the new ones and the old ones have great map design, however. Bot AI is alright. They're still kinda stupid even in Hard but I can't complain too much since I'm pretty sure the AI was carried over from CZ (Condition Zero). What makes them harder is their boosted reaction times, weapon preferences, etc.Speaking of bots, if you want to play with human players, there's no such thing as matchmaking or whatever, just a server browser which makes things...quite hard. Why? Oh, I dunno, could be UT2k4 sounds that are so repetitive that could stop you from playing on that server. Or maybe the fact that a server has 16k dollars whenever anyone spawns regardless of how many wins and losses. Basically, there is no tag for avoiding ""community"" servers. Which is exactly why I don't play this game online much. Also because literally every brazilian player is some kind of insane pro that once he snags an M4 or AK you're pretty much screwed.Sound design...eh...I mean, most of it was carried over from 1.6 and for its time, 1.6's sound design was actually pretty good. In 2004?...Not so much. I mean, it's still well-designed for detecting enemies and the like, but I mean the quality of the sounds. It all feels like someone just edited stock sounds to make it playable. I'm probably wrong on that matter, maybe, but looking back, it feels a lot that way.The design for the weapons, the least important thing ever, since you can also just download a skin that at least makes it  look better...For a Source remake, I'm actually impressed they managed to make the guns look like their real life selves in 2004! But if you're unhappy you can just do what I said above. Reloading animations are so wrong, though. Like pulling the bolt catch on the M4. That's just silly. Then again the animation was from the original CS and back then Valve didn't actually own the franchise. Ah, well. Skins also fix that.Hitboxes are actually spot-on, unlike GO. You have an AK and your crosshair's on someone's head. What happens? Exactly.That's why I love this game so much. I never complained about not having dealt enough damage, because I always did deal damage.Gameplay is balanced since its all carried over from 1.6.I won't cover the radio chatter since that's more for practical reasons rather than flavor. If you're wondering why the voice acting on them's so lame, it's exactly because it's one of the higher staff from the original CS dev team doing the acting.I'm also not going to criticize weapons I dislike despite them having a place in the game like everyone else. I hate the P90 and how overused it is, but if its in the game, its in the game. All of the weapons have their strengths and weaknesses, but the assault rifles by far have it all perfect, since, they don't have weaknesses and they're capable of doing what other weapons specialize in, best.Speaking of assault rifles, the 3-round burst is overpowered but I love it because of just that. It has pinpoint accuracy when firing, unlike 1.6 or literally every CS title as of yet, and it makes the AK seem like a donkey to use when you have the FAMAS' burst on someone's head. Literally 2 shots on one's head to get a headshot if they're wearing a helmet. You don't have to worry about the FAMAS missing one of those shots. The glock gets the same burst but it's not as effective, granted, as it is a starting pistol and doesn't have much in the way of armor penetration.Maybe for balance it breaks it a little what with the CTs having a much better cheap AR in comparison to the T's Galil. Oh well! People seem to enjoy buying deagles instead...I don't blame them.I think that's it. I hope I covered everything someone would need before purchasing this game. In my opinion, it is the best CS title as of yet. The only problem I have, personally, is the fact it lacks a filter for, well...filtering OUT the community servers. But if that's not a problem to you, you should totally get this one. If it is, well...you're probably better off getting GO. 1.6 is essentially the same as Source though, uses a server browser, too. Doesn't even have Source's Tags feature, either.Have fun playing it if ya do get it! :D			"

												First things first. This game looks just right and textures are perfect to give a smooth gameplay fps.The gameplay is very friendly on mouse controls. There are also really good available servers for different game modes.I would prefer this game from all other counter strike titles. However, there is really not an intensive rewarding system like that in csgo. This can be frustrating. But considering how old it is, there can be little support from VALVE.The ""Test of Time"" Award			"

												IMHO this is still the best Counter-Strike ever to be existed. Valve tries hard to replace Source with it's sequel Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but even a lower price can't ban CS:S from the top 10 most played games list on Steam. Maybe one day CS:GO will take the lead not only on the list but in gameplay either, but passionate CS:S players prefer the good old Source feeling with a lot of recoil and the classic buy menu.

												Played this game a lot back in the younger years of it, was a very intense FPS with a good community and clan base. Lots of different server types, mods, gun games all sorts. Very good fun.Recently came back to the game after trying the new CS:GO, I can pretty much say this is the way better game out of the two and is still very well populated with many players playing all hours of the day.Still seem to be a lot of top players playing on the servers, good people with 3000+ hours in game which I'm very glad to see.and people are still happy to chat and be social during rounds in games as well, not many people really complaining or whining about anything. So overall this is the best choice in my opinion.Fully recommended! Just don't pay the £15 on steam, get on steam sale or find key elsewhere ;)			"

												Whoo, CSS, my favorite of the series.I'll have to say, its gunplay is probably the best out of them. I know, I know, to some, it might feel like its too easy. But no, I think you still have to worry about recoil and such. Plus its just Counter-Strike with the Source engine, the only difference is that some maps from 1.6 didn't make it in and there are some new maps (that also happen to have not been carried over to GO.)Both the new ones and the old ones have great map design, however. Bot AI is alright. They're still kinda stupid even in Hard but I can't complain too much since I'm pretty sure the AI was carried over from CZ (Condition Zero). What makes them harder is their boosted reaction times, weapon preferences, etc.Speaking of bots, if you want to play with human players, there's no such thing as matchmaking or whatever, just a server browser which makes things...quite hard. Why? Oh, I dunno, could be UT2k4 sounds that are so repetitive that could stop you from playing on that server. Or maybe the fact that a server has 16k dollars whenever anyone spawns regardless of how many wins and losses. Basically, there is no tag for avoiding ""community"" servers. Which is exactly why I don't play this game online much. Also because literally every brazilian player is some kind of insane pro that once he snags an M4 or AK you're pretty much screwed.Sound design...eh...I mean, most of it was carried over from 1.6 and for its time, 1.6's sound design was actually pretty good. In 2004?...Not so much. I mean, it's still well-designed for detecting enemies and the like, but I mean the quality of the sounds. It all feels like someone just edited stock sounds to make it playable. I'm probably wrong on that matter, maybe, but looking back, it feels a lot that way.The design for the weapons, the least important thing ever, since you can also just download a skin that at least makes it  look better...For a Source remake, I'm actually impressed they managed to make the guns look like their real life selves in 2004! But if you're unhappy you can just do what I said above. Reloading animations are so wrong, though. Like pulling the bolt catch on the M4. That's just silly. Then again the animation was from the original CS and back then Valve didn't actually own the franchise. Ah, well. Skins also fix that.Hitboxes are actually spot-on, unlike GO. You have an AK and your crosshair's on someone's head. What happens? Exactly.That's why I love this game so much. I never complained about not having dealt enough damage, because I always did deal damage.Gameplay is balanced since its all carried over from 1.6.I won't cover the radio chatter since that's more for practical reasons rather than flavor. If you're wondering why the voice acting on them's so lame, it's exactly because it's one of the higher staff from the original CS dev team doing the acting.I'm also not going to criticize weapons I dislike despite them having a place in the game like everyone else. I hate the P90 and how overused it is, but if its in the game, its in the game. All of the weapons have their strengths and weaknesses, but the assault rifles by far have it all perfect, since, they don't have weaknesses and they're capable of doing what other weapons specialize in, best.Speaking of assault rifles, the 3-round burst is overpowered but I love it because of just that. It has pinpoint accuracy when firing, unlike 1.6 or literally every CS title as of yet, and it makes the AK seem like a donkey to use when you have the FAMAS' burst on someone's head. Literally 2 shots on one's head to get a headshot if they're wearing a helmet. You don't have to worry about the FAMAS missing one of those shots. The glock gets the same burst but it's not as effective, granted, as it is a starting pistol and doesn't have much in the way of armor penetration.Maybe for balance it breaks it a little what with the CTs having a much better cheap AR in comparison to the T's Galil. Oh well! People seem to enjoy buying deagles instead...I don't blame them.I think that's it. I hope I covered everything someone would need before purchasing this game. In my opinion, it is the best CS title as of yet. The only problem I have, personally, is the fact it lacks a filter for, well...filtering OUT the community servers. But if that's not a problem to you, you should totally get this one. If it is, well...you're probably better off getting GO. 1.6 is essentially the same as Source though, uses a server browser, too. Doesn't even have Source's Tags feature, either.Have fun playing it if ya do get it! :D			"

												Counter Strike Source is one of the finest FPS's ever made. With unique gameplay that combines precision and patience, beautiful maps and graphics that hold up excellently, CS: Source is a timeless game that aged like a fine wine. Its maps can be played for hours upon end, with each match being its own entertaining showdown between two opposing sides of players. Its competitive, but still casual and welcoming to new players. Compared to CS: GO, Source has better maps, servers, balancing, and overall superior gameplay. It's a masterpiece, making a FPS an artform.			"

												Aside from some camping(which happens in every FPS unfortunately), this is an excellent shooter game. Time seems to fly away when you are playing. It can probably ruin your ♥♥♥♥ing life if you get hooked on the game. Plus, I played mainly in cs_office. I still have other maps to play which is great. The best part of this game is the gameplay of course. I don't really give a ♥♥♥♥ about the graphics, the porn posted by the other users make up for it :D. Overall, it is an excellent game that you can play for a long time and still enjoy it because there are many modded servers to play(zombies, hunger games, something about surfing,etc).			"

												This Source-updated version of the classic online shooter Counter-Strike has been going strong ever since it was released back in 2004. Decent balancing, solid map designs, and simple gameplay all work for it. Of course, it's become extremely stale now, and Valve acknowledged this with the update to the Orange Box engine and Team Fortress 2-style arcadey additions (which weren't well-received by the community, mind you). Overall, I'd say avoid it now, but back in the day it wasn't bad.			"

												A real classic, simple, easy to play, easy to set up, easy to customise, but hard to master.CS:S Is basically the spirit of Counterstrike, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like skins, and crates, just pure, simple fun. Due the the game's smaller popularity than its massively-popular successor, the community is less toxic, more mature, and more interested in playing the game than collecting skins.This game also runs well on toasters, waffle-irons, microwaves, and blenders. Mods, and modded servers also allow for more replayability if you somehow become bored.In my opinion, better than CS:G., I reccomend this to everyone, whether you want to play competitively, or just casually with friends.

Just as the original CS, the Source version also has a lot of player generated content and mods which make this game an infinite source of fun, no wonder it is still actively played by a lot of people. May you be the competitive type or just play for fun, CS:S has a lot to offer to you. Highly recommended!			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												CS:S is a wonderful FPS. Anyone who enjoys CS:GO or CS should get this game. Of course this game plays differently from both of those so it will take a bit of time to get used to its feel. CS:S is probably the best FPS ever in my opinion. CS:GO is way more competitive and attracts a bigger audience. To new players, CS is no easy game. It will take atleast 40 hours of gameplay to get anywhere. CS:S is a fun fast paced FPS and I think everyone on steam should have this game. Oh... And one more thing, Dont just buy this game for Gary's Mod Textures. PLEASE!!!! "

												Easily the best Counter-Strike out there. Ok, so some people may disagree with me on this, but in my opinion: CSGO is inferior to CSS. I know in CSGO you can do stuff like surfing, updated graphics and other cool stuff but it can't compare to CSS. PLEASE NOTE that this is my OPINION. So in conclusion, I definetley recommend you should buy this game. :D			"

												While it isn't the newest and most populated Counter Strike Game, it is well worth it. Not only does it have spot on multiplayer and balancing, but it's great mods & pretty decent singleplayer. CSS can run on almost any computer that meets modern laptop standards at 60 fps, and can be on Windows, Mac, and Linux/SteamOS. This Makes this game good for any steam machine or custom console living room setup(as long as you can set a controller up). Well let's stop talking about specs and get to gameplay/features. I made a list of features below:Features:- Singleplayer & Multiplayer- Moddable- Hostage Rescue & Bomb Defuse gamemodes- Pretty good bots- Realistic Weapons and Equipment- Lots of maps- Steam Achievements & StatsOverall you really didn't need to read the whole review, if you were smart enough you already bought the game.

												If you don't like mods, buy Counter-Strike Global Offensive instead. But CS:GO, like all Counter-Strike updates, is mostly just a cosmetic upgrade (with the exception of a matchmaking system and fancy weapon skins!). But if you don't mind that, and if you don't mind modding, get Counter-Strike Source. Why? It is much better in terms of modding than CS:GO, the majority of servers will support mods so don't worry about that. You can replace all of those crappy default weapon models with HD models far better than CS:GO's with fancy animations. Get a custom HUD and a fancy ENB series to top it off, and you have something far better than CS:GO that costs less!			"

I know in CSGO you can do stuff like surfing, updated graphics and other cool stuff but it can't compare to CSS. PLEASE NOTE that this is my OPINION. So in conclusion, I definetley recommend you should buy this game. :D			"

												While it isn't the newest and most populated Counter Strike Game, it is well worth it. Not only does it have spot on multiplayer and balancing, but it's great mods & pretty decent singleplayer. CSS can run on almost any computer that meets modern laptop standards at 60 fps, and can be on Windows, Mac, and Linux/SteamOS. This Makes this game good for any steam machine or custom console living room setup(as long as you can set a controller up). Well let's stop talking about specs and get to gameplay/features. I made a list of features below:Features:- Singleplayer & Multiplayer- Moddable- Hostage Rescue & Bomb Defuse gamemodes- Pretty good bots- Realistic Weapons and Equipment- Lots of maps- Steam Achievements & StatsOverall you really didn't need to read the whole review, if you were smart enough you already bought the game.

												The Counter-Strike series[en.wikipedia.org] has always been a childhood game right from the day I first endured my experience on the PC. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero was the first one I ever played, the campaign remains in my mind today even though I no longer have it (I think?). When I saw that Source was available with Garry's Mod for all but a shilling, I had to grab it and give it a test run. Safe to say, I haven't been disappointed.With a complete graphical overhaul, I was paying close attention to the detail of the weapons and smaller geometries around the world in addition to the character texturing/meshes. Valve pulled it off, and they did it well. I played this game for hours with a friend, jumping from server to server experiencing what I had never done before. Playing online at such a young age during Condition Zero was just something I never did. In my own personal opinion, Source is better than even the more modern day Call of Duty's, and it is from the same category (First-Person Shooter). I even think the sounds got some looking after as they seem to be much clearer then they did back in 2004. However, all good things must come to an end as I stopped my CS experience here: Global Offensive just does not appeal to me, at all. Onto the pros and cons!Pros:» Graphical overhaul has mentioned, a real step-up from Condition Zero.» Sound also seems to be a big factor. I noticed that even the running sounds were revamped for the release.» Animations were reworked as far as I can tell. One thing that stood out to me was the idle animation for the knife.» Many online gamemods, great fun to play!» Although this is a Valve product, it has great integration with Garry's Mod which is nice to see.Cons:» Considering this game is ten years old (I can't believe it!) it's absolutely magnificent. I just wish there had been a campaign like CZ.My rating for CSS is 8/10. I took into account the length the game has been released and some of the technical factors in regards to the game engine and blockages that may have come up. The only thing that stopped it reaching a nine was the no campaign. I wish they had that!			"

												Counter-Strike: Source is definitely one of my favorite FPS's of all time. It excels in places current FPS's even fails, despite the voice acting and graphics, had it been released today it would certainly make it. It also holds up today.    [/tr]    [/tr] Category Score Notes
 Graphics 9 Although it isn't as good as say Global Offense, it still holds up.   Voice Acting 9 I'll be fair. Its CS's voice acting, in the Source engine. So its not that great, but it gets a pass due to age.    Controls 10 Never had a problem, always has felt right.   Maps 10 Damn I love cs_office. Most maps are great and fits the mood of the game.  Mechanics 8 Admittedly some cheap shots, but still solid. The Magnum Sniper Rifle/AWP is broken. And that's why I love it.
 Multiplayer 10 Multiplayer is the only way to play and its great. I tend to enjoy deathmatchs the best but normal plant the bomb/stop them from planting the bomb is great too. Final verdict is 8. I prefer Team Fortress 2, but if I ever have a chance to play this I will. The annoyances are too severe to give it a 9-10 but its not enough to give it anything less than an 8.			"

Counter-Strike: Source ReviewCounter-Strike ported over to the Source engine.Counter-Strike: Source is a remake of the first Counter-Strike game. This game, instead of the first one, uses the source engine, and is easier to play. Counter-Strike: Source contains a friendly community and lots of different servers. I would say that this game is a lot less serious than the new game in the series, Global Offensive. I think Counter-Strike: Source has more entertainming minigame, roleplay and surfing servers and also has more of a friendly community. I'm not saying there are no deathmatch servers, Counter-Strike: Source is still a great FPS shooter, but if you're looking for ranks, proffesionals and amazing guns, go and get Counter-Strike: Global Offensive! Recommend this game! Thanks for reading!			"
