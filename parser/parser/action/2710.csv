												Just finished my playthrough of Act of War: Direct Action last night.However did play the GOG version as the steam version isnt fully updated with Win 10 support yet.That beeing said, the steam version should support upto Win 7 so if you have that then do not fear from buying it on steam!So that is over with, now to the game.Act of War is a RTS from 2005 that follows the ""purest"" RTS form with build basing and lots of unique units for every faction. The single player playthrough is fun and gives you quite a few headshakes even for a old school RTS players like myself, every unit has it´s strenght and weakness which is amazing and makes it impossible to just take a huge bunch of tanks and win the game, every unit has a counter and even footmen the most basic unit in every RTS is in fact valuable in end game.The story itself isnt much to talk about, it does the job and drives the game forward in a good speed and in a way that makes you want to continue, it is made with on old Red Alert/C&C formular with greenscreen recordings and real action videos, this gives you a more insightfull way to follow your missions and why you need to do what the mission states, it is overall a better story than most RTS`s i´ve played and it really keeps you stuck in many ways.Gameplay wise Act of War has everything you could wish for in a RTS and more. That it starts with the entire lineup from any classic RTS, footsoldiers, light tanks, tanks, special units and ofc super weapons. Now that is all like any other and that is what we enjoy, but hold on, there is a lot more, like capturing prisoners of war for money, counter super weapons, off screen airplane control, usage of heli´s to save your wounded soldiers and tanks across the battle field and much much more.All in all Act of War is a great RTS that has been overlooked by many as it came out while there was other more famous RTS`s on the market which is a shame as it is diffenetly worth buying and worth playing.

												A very well written and playable game which keeps you engaged and moving along even if you only intended to play one mission as you will find it too easy and tempting to not quit after just a mission of the campaign.  Be warned, for Windows 7 and 8, excluding 8.1, it requires some research and going through a few hoops to get it running, but well worth the effort.			"

												Act of war direct action is one of the brilliant strategy game ever made for me.Probably I must have played this more than 100 hours at non-steam version when it was first released.It's scenario was inspired from Dale Brown's stories (Who is well known military novel author like Tom Clancy).If you like Tom clancy style scenarios or series like 24,homeland etc you will probably like this game.AoW:DA also looks similar C&C titles,building base,gathering petrol resources and producing units to crush enemy.Cutscenes is one of the best part of AoW.Which made with real actors.On missions a little video screen appears on the corner and begins to inform you about mission and shows news just like C&C.You can capture wounded enemy soldiers as a prisoner and sell it.Game changing shape according to missions.Sometimes you control small tactical units to eliminate enemy forces or sometimes building bases and producing mass armies.As far as I read around, some guys complain about that game doesn't work on windows 7 64 bit and more than 2 GB ram.I run windows 7 64 bit home premium and have 8 GB ram,I haven't experienced any problem with game.I just installed and hit the play button it launched.Edit:A patch has been released for game to run on win7 and 8.1+Good scenario+excellent graphics (compare 2005's titles not todays)+C&C style videos+Music+No unit limitations+tactical units+never bored (it depends on you of course :) )-No widecsreen resolution but there is a mod on moddb that can add widescreen resolutionAs a result 10/10.

												Act of War: Direct Action is a military strategy game developed by Eugen Systems. Eugen Systems are the developer of games such as the Wargame series and R.U.S.E. The game is set in an unknown period though seems to be set around the 1990s-early 2000s. A global energy crisis occurs and the uprise of terrorist organisations allow them to use the crisis to their advantage to gain publicity. However, suspense is great as to revealing whether a president of an existing major oil company was in charge of the crisis and the uproar of terrorist attacks. You, the player take control of Task Force Talon to fight back the terrorist threat that is secretly hitting many American nations including San Francisco, Washington D.C. among other worldwide nation states.The game sounds great on paper but the question of does it live up to that expectation is present. And yes, I can simply say that this game immerses the player into the story through the games mix of in-game cut scenes and a real-life movie. Instead of in-game cut scenes during each mission there will be a live movie playing that continues the story through actors. I really like this approach to the cut scenes because this game was released in 2005 and in-game cutscenes would have been dull at best. Therefore by placing actors to enhance and further the story it allows for more elements and reach in the story compared to in-game cinematics.According to the game mission selection feature there are 33 missions. These missions are crafted with profound engagement and are relatively simple. The main missions are solid. They progress the story, are intense, and they are entertaining. As the game progresses the missions and story improves in quality. Missions would include taking a stronghold and/or defending your base or secondary missions of destroying field generators to assist in your main mission. The use of secondary missions are substantial as just mentioned as if you complete them they provide benefits. For example, destroying enemy field generators help in limiting the enemy weapons. Or capturing a bank would provide more money for your base to build troops, among others. I completed the game in about 13.5 hours on normal difficulty. Each mission had an appropriate length of completion whilst varying in difficulty.The gameplay is your typical gameplay for a strategy birds-eye view game. You control multiple units and move them along the battlefield while completing your objectives. It is good at best at times, however the pathfinding can be ridiculous. For one having many vehicular units is annoying because they get caught over little objects like civilian vehicles. Moving the units is annoying as there are no options for formations to move your best units at the front followed by your weaker/more useless units. So other than those two complaints gameplay was good. The graphics are pretty solid for a 2005 game. They flourish in showcasing the buildings, locations, and capturing the various locations. The sound is pretty annoying including the main menu theme. I liked the dialogue in the game quite a bit. The dialogue is short, sweet, engaging and intense, which improved the quality of the story.Towards the technical aspect things are not so great. There is no full screen option in the game. The game is capped at 1280x720. However, the limited resolution is understandable for an 11 year old game and there is a mod to allow for higher resolutions. You cannot access steam overlay, which is a real nuisance. Basically if you want to talk on steam or do anything else on your computer while you play you have to quit the game as minimising will not work. It is a major nuisance as specified but if you are playing for multiple hours at a time it does not overly bother you. And there are framerate hitches when moving along the map or selecting other parts of the map.Lastly the game was recently updated to allow for Windows 10. Fair to say it works like a breeze.Overall, Act of War: Direct Action is a very unfamiliar game amongst people on Steam judging by its 80 reviews. But for $2.99, I totally recommend this game. You will get a lot of value out of the game with multiple game modes but you will enjoy the story and the gameplay aspect of the game. The rating is low due to its technical issues but I can't penalise it overly due to its age. In saying that, the positives are strong. 6.75/10.----Thanks for reading my review!

												Great RTS, that was overshadowed by C&C generals. This game does not use hit points for its units, but uses real world scenerios. For example, a tank will withstand rifle fire all day. But one shot with a helfire missile and it is destroyed. Most RTS would have the missile do 10 out of 15 damage but instead the missile will do its job. That is the basics. The campaign is great and skirmeshes are endless. The only problem is it is a pain to get to work on new computers. Which is a shame because it uses all real world models on all the units, and it still looks pretty good.			"

												A RTS game with almost realism feel will force even the veteran strategist to rethink their move; because, here it doesn't take 20 shots with a tank to kill 1 soldier no, now it takes 1 shot to kill 5 men. This game was built before its time so the graphics are not the prettiest but still good enough to get a closes comparison to C&C Generals, and with the destructive environment you will almost think its Battlefield 4. All factions are balanced with there own pros an cons Vs. the other factions so there is no top advantage of taking 1 faction over the other, but on that note I do recommend taking the group you can handle better than the others, but try the others if you don't like them then learn what they can do.Now the best part about this game is it's now available for Windows 7, Windows 8 and 8.1 and giving the time it was created this game should run fine enough on low end PCs.7.5/10 $10.99 CAN was hoping for $5 but still worth it.

												Game is well worth the $10 for any RTS fan. Played Campaign only.CONS:Music is very generic and bland.Can't rotate building placement.Story/cutscense are corny/cheesy, not bad just cheesy.  (could almost follow it on mute)No higher resolution or 16:9 support.64-bit OS systems have to set their virtual memory (total including VRAM) to just under 3gb to run.PROS:Has a pretty nice array of weapons to use, and the campaign is nicely paced. Graphics are pretty good especially for the time it was released. Base building, air support, tactical insertions the game is done pretty well. The game runs pretty well (despite having to virtually chop off most of my RAM)The sound effects in the game (including voice over quality) were all pretty good.Upgrades were fun to work towards and unlock.Has some nice use of units not used in many RTS games.Its a very well rounded Modern RTS.I will be getting the sequel to it real soon.Need a slightly more recent one with Co-op LAN/online			"

												I liked this game. It was fun to play and they had some interesting weapons. For example there was a tank that can send out an exploding drone. I like the resource system being a simple system of oil or money. I also liked the different aircraft. Some where tactical while some where strategic. The also did a good job of using stealth for reccon. I often don't play RTS games because I am a TBS fan and RTS games are sometimes to quick for me. At the easy setting the pace was nice and enjoyable and I didn't feel rushed.			"

Latest update supposedly supports Windows 7, well before you hit the Add to Cart button, I highly recommend you do not buy it! Absolute waste of money, time and download limit.Very disappointing as the idea of this game is awesome, but that is all.REVIEW UPDATED!!!!For a while there I thought the Dev was not going to update this title to run on later operating systems. Well the other night I read in the forums that they had done an update so I thought why not give them a chance. So I downloaded and ran it and to my amazment the menu came up, I followed all the screens to get into the game and started playing. Absolutely amazing work Dev. Thank you for making this classic title run on later machines. Awesome work!			"

												NOTE: I did not play the multiplayer, please take that into account when reading this review.Brought to you by the same team who produced Command & Conquer: Generals, Act of War is set in modern day times and centred around control of the world's oil reserves, depicting a resource crisis. The game itself is fairly realistic, and steeped in military parlance, while still being fairly accessible to newbies to the genre. While the campaign takes a while to get going, and the pacing can be a little off at times, I found it enjoyable and challenging at various points. That being said, it never felt unfair and while it may prove to be tricky occasionally, a strategy can be found to overcome every circumstance encountered in the game.Recommended to any RTS fan, and especially to those who enjoyed the Command & Conquer series.Played on Windows 10 Pro x64 without any issues.

												Very interesting and fun to play strategy from the strategy god Eugen Systems.This strategy game is different from many RTS where you are playing in open world. Here you will mostly play in the cities.Tom Clany style plot written by Captain Dale Brown, life action movies, units gain experience from combat, lots of city fighting, POWs and other interesting game elements.Unfortunately kids with win10 laptops bough by their parents and other schoolboys with the latest hardware and lack of bains are giving negative reviews due to lack of skills to install XP for older games.My rating: 10/10I wish there were more games like this one.Highly recommended.

												Balance is all over the place, but it has a certain charm to it that is severely lacking in modern RTS games.  Very difficult to amass a large force with high cost units, slow and micro intensive repairing, and overall fragility of everything in the game.

												Act of War: Direct Action is a very solid gaming package. Units seem to be well balanced, combat is fun and made pretty interesting by dense city sections, and the visuals should keep anybody more than satisfied. The story is pretty bad but this is an RTS not an rpg, the acting from the various cut scene actors were actually ♥♥♥♥. Third graders would’ve performed better. If it wasn't for the horrible acting and wonkiness of plot this would have been a gorgeously presented game. Effects are decent the whole way through, but the environments are really where Act of War has a leg up on all others. Sadly multiplayer is dead, so this game now becomes a buy only if cheap game.

												While this was a fun game back in the day, feeling of a similar vein to Command and Conquer but with a sleeker, more realistic vibe. I can't recommend this, at least as a Steam purchase due to the fact that the developer never updated it properly for systems beyond Windows XP.While it is possible to get it to run on later OSs with some system tweaking or some ""unofficial patches"" created by fans, I find it more trouble than it's worth and even with me implimenting these fixes the game still suffered major flaws, such as crashes and ridiculously long loading times.If you have Windows XP or don't mind tweaking around with obscure system settings which can potentionally render Windows unoperable, then try your luck with this game. If not then play something else.			"

												Singleplayer is OK, multiplayer on the other hand is very unbalanced. Once the AI finds you they will attack nonstop until their wallet is empty and after that they will do nothing. Yes, you can be out of money very easily if you spend on wrong stuff or if you cant capture enough oil fields. Every game feels like capture the oil fields because that is the AIs main goal, you are secondary. The US army has fun and useful units, the other two factions are useless nd boring. There are too many steps until you can actually start making useful units which is very boring. There isnt enough maps and not enough modes ad youcant change settings either.			"

												It is an awesome game, I brought it when it was released back in 2005.Based on the novel of same name by Dale Brown. Act of war Direct Action is an engaging game. It tells a thrilling story of power, politics and terror of possible near future due to energy crisis. like typical strategy game it has 3 factions; they are well balanced and have their respective preferred tactics on the field.US Army: you can generally expect the units to be the best in its class but lacks diversity, take example of the M1 tank, which has highest HP and firepower. It is very straight forward, easy to manage, learn and use. Task force Talon: simply put: Jack of all trade but master of none, many of its units can fill in multiple roles, for example the Spinner Drones, can switch between anti-tank and anti-air, as well as bomb drone. also rely heavly on infantry, It has best infantry in the early on.Consortium: is a stealthy, high tech faction rely heavly on stealth and ambush tactics. All 3 factions have its version of superweapons or in this game, called Tactical weapon. Each faction has its way to counter it.It has innovative resource system where encourage you to capture enemy troops while protect your own from being captured. especially in later stage of game.And remember the Live action cutscenes videos from Westwood Studio? Yup, this game has it. It is, after all, a 2005 game, so don't expect to have top notch game engine of modern strategy game, but it is still impressive. This game has odd resolution options at today's standard and lacks wide screen support; however it shouldn't matter once you get used to it. It suffered from technical issues regarding the memory addressing, but I believe it is fixed with latest patch as I was able to fire it up on my laptop which has i7 processor, 12GB of ram, nvidia GT735 graphic processor and runs windows 8.1.

												Both Act of War Games, have been finally updated to work on Modern Systems.I have i7 CPU and Geforce 970 using windows 7, both games work and play good.One minor complaint is Direct Action needs a community patch to run 1080p, but there is NO UI stretching and looks perfect when patch and AA forced from Nvidia Control Panel.I'm not really much of online multiplayer gamer, so I have no idea if MP is alive or works at all. But the game does have AI Skirmish with a nice selection of maps.Act of War is true classic, and I was always disappointed it never worked on modern machines. I am now delighted that it can be played once again. This game had stellar presentation for back in 2005. You should enjoy yourself if you like the idea of pseudo present day military RTS with Full Motion Video cutscenes with decent acting and good production values.			"

												A truely amazing RTS. With its modern setting and all. The only thing that is really not that great is the long loading time for windows 10. But otherwise it is an amazing game worth checking out.			"

												Act of War direct action is a good game, I would recomend buying it.Pros - Good variety of Units - Combines Modern Warfare with science fiction (Very well) - Live action cutscenes - Good Campaign - Good voice acting - You can take wounded enemy troops as POW'sCons - US Army is slightly overpowered (Not too much of a problem) - Consortium AMX tanks are unrealistic (In the game they can go toe to toe with an M1A2 Abrams) - Game is VERY fast paced - Destructable enviornment sucks! (Everything that gets blown up just sinks into the ground afterwards. Following a battle, all you have are clean empty streets, not rubble and wreckage.Despite it's flaws, this is a good game that I recomend buying.			"

												I have heard that this doesn't run very well on Windows 7 & 8 but it runs perfectly on 10.Let's say that this is not a game to change your lift but if your a fan of Command and Conqueror and would like an updated version of C&C , then this it the game for you.It's not going to change your life and the first few levels are a bit tired but the rest of the game is certain worth investing yourr money in.

												It is an awesome game, I brought it when it was released back in 2005.Based on the novel of same name by Dale Brown. Act of war Direct Action is an engaging game. It tells a thrilling story of power, politics and terror of possible near future due to energy crisis. like typical strategy game it has 3 factions; they are well balanced and have their respective preferred tactics on the field.US Army: you can generally expect the units to be the best in its class but lacks diversity, take example of the M1 tank, which has highest HP and firepower. It is very straight forward, easy to manage, learn and use. Task force Talon: simply put: Jack of all trade but master of none, many of its units can fill in multiple roles, for example the Spinner Drones, can switch between anti-tank and anti-air, as well as bomb drone. also rely heavly on infantry, It has best infantry in the early on.Consortium: is a stealthy, high tech faction rely heavly on stealth and ambush tactics. All 3 factions have its version of superweapons or in this game, called Tactical weapon. Each faction has its way to counter it.It has innovative resource system where encourage you to capture enemy troops while protect your own from being captured. especially in later stage of game.And remember the Live action cutscenes videos from Westwood Studio?

												This is by far one of my favorite RTS games and heres why.One of the big points here in my oppinion is that infantry is valued much more in this game than vehicles since infantry is far more versatile. From dropping onto roofs and breaching a garrisoned building or setting up an ambush to take down a group of enemy vehicles they can do most anything.Infantry can also take cover (There is a cover system) behind most structures and objects including base buildings you have built or your enemy has built.Just a quickie but if you played and liked Command and Conquer Generals you might like this though Act of War can actually be a little harder to learn in some cases.My biggest beef with this game however is that it takes some tweaking to finally get it to run on Windows 7 and 8. It can be tricky and in some cases simply refuses to want to work. Be patient and vigilant and I garuntee you can get this game to run.			"

												One of the BEST RTS I have ever played.  It was so good I actually went out and bought the book it was based on by Dale Brown called Act of War. Surprisingly enough the story line in the game is MUCH better than even the story line in the book.  I was in total shock.  BUY THIS GAME and it's sequel.  I just wish it ran on Windows 7 x64.			"

												Quite simply one of the most exciting strategy games I ever played so far.With a truly frightening possible scenario and excellent acting in the full motion video cutscenes, you'll think you're watching a movie.The game takes place in the near future where a worldwide energy crisis has pushed the price of gasoline to the high price of 7 dollars per gallon and the worldwide economy is in a tailspin that terrorists are quick to take advantage of and cause heavy losses.You play as Brigadier General Jason Richter, leader of the newly formed direct action operations group known as Task Force TALON that is charged with stopping the terrorists and also finding out who's backing them and stop them as well.The game plays out very much like the Command & Conquer games and other similar titles with the fact that you build a base and then train units that you send out to exterminate the opposing forces, the units will also gain experience and become veterans that can take more damage while also at the same time dish out more.But one thing to note is that sometimes your infantry units, as well as those of the enemy, can become seriously injuried in the middle of battle and be incapacitated that can lead to them being captured unless they're healed by either a medic or taken to a hospital that you can construct.By capturing enemy infantry units and having a hospital in your base, you can gain another source of income, there's also banks and treasury buildings that can be garrisoned by both sides that will generate a set number of income until it is empty and when you're in the oil rich areas, you can get money from collecting the oil and bringing it to an oil refinery for cash.There are some sci-fi units here as well, like the Shield unit which is a form of exo-skeleton that comes equipped with a gatling gun for dealing with infantry units and a rocket pod for the vehicles and many others.

												One of the coolest strategy games of all time. Small pain to get  working on a system with more than 2 GB of memory (easy to fix, just a process), but the game is totally worth it. Units markedly improve as they gain experience, the primary form of currency is POW's (capture prisoners on the field, make money), and I like the emphasis on infantry/ground vehicle/tank combat. It does have aircraft but they're not a unit you directly control. If you're a fan of RTS games, check this out!			"
