Pros:- Main campaign can be played co-op- Decent controls (no controller needed)- Good graphics and cutscenes- Lots of weapons to choose/customize- Low ammo supply which requires you to carefully aim (more realistic than those games that have plenty of ammo)Cons:- Character movement is sluggish (but so is the enemies' to compensate)			"

												I logged 640 hours into a 6 hour game. I really enjoy the atmosphere and the involvement and tools available for co-operative play.However, if you're playing this game with the mentality of it being a sequal to some of the original Resident Evils, you're going to be disappointed. You will get the most enjoyment out of the game if you go in with the mindset that it will be a cinematic action game.Edit: Since this is actually getting attention or something, I'm going to emphasize: If you've played any classic Resident Evil games (1, 2, 3), from Resident Evil 4 and onward they are *not the same kind of game*. While Resident Evil 4 could possibly get a bit of a pass on still being a horror game, this is NOT a horror game. It's an action game. Go into it expecting a co-op-heavy action game, and only then will the game become very enjoyable.			"

												In the light of 0% of people finding my initial review helpful, I've elected to explain a bit more.  This is one of my favourite games of all time.  But this port is disgusting.  The list of intended features pales in comparison to the console versions, because they think they can get away with it.  The DLC comes out 6 years after the game, at a horriffic price, and I buy the game at that time, expecting to repeat my console experience with my girlfriend.  Turns out, not only have they done that, they've removed local co-op entirely.  They've even gone to extra length to prevent modders from adding it.Even more disgusting is that was a top priority.  Hundreds of people in Capcom's own crash/bug thread on Steam alone, can't even start this bloody thing.  Other people get to certain chapters and can't finish.  Versus is an advertised feature that just doesn't work.  We have region lock and crashes and immense lag.  We are waiting months for a patch and from what I hear none's coming.  What does this say to us?  It says consumers take up the role of playtesting, and if it's worth Capcom's while they'll fix our problems.  What problems have they fixed?  Quite a few, but before any patch of any kind, when converting from GFWL to Steam, the split-screen code modders had used, was totally purged, meaning forcing people to buy extra copies was more important than each customer's gameplay experience.  And of course, as I've said, they've not approached fixing every problem.Guess what I've done.  Borrowed my friend's PS3 and that copy of the game to play it with my girlfriend.  Because we're not building a bloody gaming PC just for one game.  Let alone one that we may not even be capable of finishing because its publisher have abandoned it.Now may I say it?F V C KY O UC A P C O M .			"

												Me and my boyfriend played Resident Evil 5 coop where the first player controls Chris and the second player controls Sheva. We had many fun moments but also many frustrating moments. I was very unsure if I should recommend it to you or not.Let's start with the positive things. It's a really good coop action game, one of those where you have to stay together and really cooperate. The game has many environments, cool combat music and great variety of bosses! You and your partner can tease each other with your character's voice commands. We were shouting at each other a lot and it was very entertaining.In my short clips video you can see all the good things I was writting about. We were really having fun and laughing a lot:  Fun Times in RE5 - Clips	And here comes all the criticism I need to share with you. The Steam PC version of Resident Evil 5 has many bugs and complicated mouse+keyboard controls. I don't like quick time events very much. But the weird combinations of buttons in RE5 are unbelievable. Sometimes A+D and sometimes F+V with very short time to react to that. I watched some gameplay on consoles and they only had to press one button on their controllers. It's even more annoying during cutscenes when you sit back, enjoy and don't expect anything.Another unpleasant moment is when you find out that you as Sheva won't get the steam achivement for finishing a chapter if your partner's game crashes or if you decide to stop playing in the middle of a chapter, save the progress and finish later. Only Chris, the player who host the game, will get it then.It happened to us that an important enemy with a keycard we needed spawned in an inaccessible area, I was locked in a cage and my boyfriend spent quite long time trying to get there while I was waiting and waiting for ages. We tried it again and this time we only saw his shadow on the floor. I tried to use explosives so we got him down from that unknown place this time and luckily it was on the right side.Another very annoying moment was the final boss fight where you have to press F as Sheva for almost a minute. Not just that but you have to do it SUPER fast. You kind of need to be like The Flash! I played this game 6 years ago as well and I remember I had to give up back then. It was not possible. On my last playthrough I tried it so many times and I managed to do it only once.. My finger really hurt, so I had to ignore the pain and was lucky my boyfriend didn't mess it up after that so we could continue. Uffff! These moments definitely made us want to ragequit..RE5 Bosses in general can be very annoying. When you are not doing the right thing - shooting the right spots at the right moments , you are basically wasting your ammo and the game won't give you any more and it won't make you fail either even when you clearly can't do it. You just have to decide for yourself to restart from the last checkpoint.. But in case you somehow manage to do it but you already wasted all your ammo before, good luck to you, because you can't buy ammo directly. However you can buy weapons and sell them so you keep the ammo they had.Final verdict: Partly recommended! Overall I am very hesitant in case of Resident Evil 5. I am a fan of RE games. I like the coop option of it. But all the bugs are breaking the full enjoyment of it for me. I believe the console version is much better! If you love Resident Evil games and you have the patience to deal with it, go for it! Wait for a sale, please. Don't pay the full price for something what couldn't have bugs fixed since 2009.Thank you for reading my review! In case you have some questions feel welcome to ask me :)			"

												A lot of people give this game crap for being ""not scary"". Well that may be true, but if you put aside that you'll see you get an amazing looking game with great gameplay, voice acting and a pretty good storyline for pretty cheap these days.

												First of all, Games for Windows Live sucks... it really gave me a hard time, I had to fight with this thing first to be able to play online co-op at all. In the end it was worth it though.The game is not scary at all, like you'd expect from an RE title. There's lots of action, tough enemies, and some nice puzzles too, which I enjoyed. I wouldn't play it in solo, it's best to play it through with a friend using microphone, that way it's so much fun. I had a nice time playing this one, recommended.			"

												I previously owned the Gold Version of this game on the PS3, and my wife and I had put an unhealthy amount of hours into it. It was one of our guilty pleasures.If you have someone to play with, it's a good game. I recommend the experience. Don't take the game seriously, and it'll treat you well (unless the AI is controlling your partner; seriously, find a buddy to play this with).So why the ""NO"" recommendation?After our copy was stolen, we decided to pick it up sale on Steam and make use of Steam Streaming for some more couch co-op fun.There is no option for local co-op.In the process of porting the game over from GFW platform over to Steam, Capcom literally ripped out the code that allowed for local co-op (for seemingly no reason). And unfortunately, because this is a port, there are no mods (currently) that can rectify the underlying GFWness that is associated with multiplayer.This game is already reviewed ""very positively"" by the community, so I'm comfortable throwing this one ""No"" into the bucket. This one review isn't going to have an impact on the overall score of the game. But this is something that could be important to some people, and I wanted to highlight the lack of this particular feature.It's a shame, as I was really looking forward to punching boulders with my wife again.

												This is still, to this day, the best co-op experience I've ever had in a complete game. Over 1,000 hours on the 360 version, and somewhere close to that between Steam, GFWL, and retail PC disc versions of this game, I'm still enjoying every minute this game is running on any system.But the important thing to add here is that finally, after about 5 years, the long-awaited Gold Edition content has made its way to PC (and GFWL has been replaced with Steamworks integration). Lost in Nightmares, Desperate Escape, Mercenaries Reunion, Versus, and most importantly, Warrior Chris / Heavy Metal Chris, all in 60fps here on the PC version.A giant majority of my total hours spent in this game have been in the extra game mode, Mercenaries and Mercenaries Reunion; this is a unique time attack mode where you aim to kill a set number of enemies, breaking time bonuses and getting melee kills for additional time as you progress to complete the stage. With 18 characters / costumes across both Mercenaries and Mercenaries Reunion, as well as three variations of each of the 8 stages (Merc, Reunion, and No Mercy), there is plenty of content to keep you playing and having a good time, single player. But throw that all in with the option to play Duo for these modes (as well as the game's feature co-op campaign), and you've added hundreds of hours of additional gameplay with a co-op partner.Lost in Nightmares, one of the Gold Edition campaigns which takes place in the flashback sequence where Chris loses his partner Jill Valentine, is one of the many highlights of the game. Like a love letter to their fans, Lost in Nightmares includes a handful of throwbacks and references to old-school Resident Evil flare (cranks, traps, a piano, and an easter egg featuring classic fixed-camera angles for the beginning segment of the campaign, to name a few). It makes me hopeful for the future of the Resident Evil franchise, and it's the most enjoyable add-on content I've ever played.I have nothing bad to say about this game, and endless good things to say. Since its release in 2009, I've been in love with Resident Evil 5, and I don't think the love for this game will ever die.			"

												Resident Evil 5 is an action blockbuster that has you play as Chris ""McTestosterone"" Redfield, after becoming a Gears of War character and training to the point he can right hook a boulder 5m away in a active volcano, Chris travels to Africa in the hope of finding his missing partner Jill Valentine. With the help of his new partner Sheva Alomar, they journey throughout West Africa murdering every inhabitant in their line of sight and constantly screaming each others name when wanting to open a door in hopes of finding Chris' partner and stopping the demon lord who wants to saturate the world with black tentacles.They encounter many things such as:- Axe man and Megaphone man- black tentacle monster #1- Chainsaw guy from Resident Evil 4- a large bat- tribal people with spears- a tentacle monster fish with a man's face- black tentacle monster #2- cigar chomping Gatling Gun dude- A larger black tentacle monster- A Demon Lord- and Demon Lord with black tentacle armEssentially Resident Evil 5 is a 3rd person action game that tries very hard to take itself seriously and at times I lost interest with what was happening story wise and focused more on the ""shoot everything that moves"" aspect. If you are a fan of Resident Evil 4, you'll feel a bit at home with this as it shares the same style of gameplay with the exception of removing the grid based inventory from 4, for a simpler inventory system like on the first set of Resident Evil games with the add of a Dpad quick equip, allowing to change weapons without entertaining your inventory. Resident Evil 5 also offers  co-op play in the campaign and Mercenaries mode. The second player can join via local or online and takes control of Sheva (in mercenaries it's whatever merc they desire) The only real difference to them is that instead of punching things, Sheva just roundhouse kicks or flash kicks stunned enemies as well as having different call outs. One thing i found lacking was Chris' personality, on 4 we had Leon's bombastic cheeky humor and would make a wise crack at the situation. On 5 however, we are given Chris who essentially mimics a western AAA action hero who's motives are to save his partner and beat up the demon lord, it isn't all that bad as they clearly make fun of the whole roid'd Chris in the final sequence of the game. *Edit*I'd also like to add the voice acting at times isn't terribly great however it is saved by Ricardo Irving's comic book style of villain dialogue (no joke, despite the wackiness that was in 4, Irving feels like a character ripped right out of Viewtiful Joe) and D.C Douglas doing a fantastic job with the Demon Lord. If you looking for another taste of Resident Evil, before it turned into the mess that was 6, this will fill that nourishment beflre they hand you food poisoning. I highly recommend playing with friend as it actually makes the experience much better, it's like playing Resident Evil 4 but with someone else, and who isn't the brain dead Sheva AI with the only purpose is to be a walking inventory.My final thoughts are eight boulder punches out of CHRIIISSSSSSSSSSSSS!

												RE5 is a very enjoyable game when looked at in a vacuum, which some people may not desire to or be able to do. In some ways, it seems like kind of a transitional game, with the developers not 100% sure where it should go next -- should they raise the standards of the writing, should they go back to more limited ammo, harder to kill individual zombies, etc. Fun action game but not a true RE game for the hardcore fans. It is more enjoyable playing it co-op with a friend.			"

The game full of bugs in single and coop: frequent disconnections, collision issues, enemy spawn issues, versus mode is merely working, reduced performance compared to GFWL version.  If you are intending to buy it, keep in mind that playing with random people in coop or Versus is no longer possible at all due to bugs.It's possible to buy game and get the GFWL version which is brilliantly ported, but you unable to play the extra content with the GFWL version.You ruined the game, CAPCOM.

												The same Resi 5 that you've known for 6 years, now with a litany of new issues after migrating to Steamworks.Stay away until it gets a patch- this game is BUSTED right now.A few examples:Highest-level AA (C16XQ) doesn't function at allRandom crashes to desktop (ex. during the cutscene after a boss fight)Can't exchange weapons with partner in single-playerMismatched button prompts in menus (Keyboard prompts when using a controller)Objects missing from the game world (flowers at the start of 5-1)Misaligned lens flaresNo stages or characters unlocking in Mercenaries, despite repeated A-ranksAiming your gun using the Lost in Nightmares DLC classic camera easter egg is broken for Mouse and KeyboardNo laser sight when using Mouse & KeyboardMissing the promised migration tool for GFWL savesSplitscreen co-op mod no longer works, no official implementationRoad Warrior Chris and Business Sheva (originally PC-exclusive costumes) have been locked away behind the Gold Edition DLCGold Edition DLC is way too expensive. For 90% of the cost of the main game, you get two story chapters, some costumes, a mercenaries variant and some online vs modes that will die out very quickly. This content is 5 years old, but is being treated like a brand-new release from a price standpoint.At the time of writing (roughly a week and a half after release), Capcom has yet to respond to the enormous number of bug reports in the community forum. Considering that the RE1 remaster still hasn't seen a patch for its framerate issues in the 2.5 months it's been out, you should be very wary of this.I can't stress this enough- don't give up your hard-earned cash until the game is in a release-worthy state.EDIT: As of April 10th, Capcom has responded to the community's call for local co-op and 3D support by making the original GFWL version available through Steam's branch system.Not only is this an incredibly lazy solution, it also doesn't work for any of the Steamworks-only Gold Edition content. It would be a nice hold-over if the development team were working on official implementations of the missing features, but the official steam community forum thread makes no mention of such things.To me, this indicates that the 'Fix Co-Op' and 'Fix 3D' boxes on Capcom's to-do list have been checked, and that they are moving on. Don't buy this if you're looking for a port that treats the PC platform with respect- you won't find it here.			"

												Resident Evil 5 is a shooter developed and published by CAPCOM.Resident Evil 5 takes place in Africa and you play as Chris Redfield and after you finished the campaign once, you can play as Chris partner, Sheva. The environment are African but somewhat worse because there are zombies there. Resident Evil 5 is not as scary as it should but fun nevertheles.Resident Evil 5 gameplay aren't that exciting for PC but if you played the franchise before, Resident Evil 5 is quite great. One of the downside is the inventory system, it's very limited and makes you have to attend to it everytime. The AI are not bad but not good either. The AI partner can be told to be in assault stance or cover stance. Assault stance makes the AI partner use the best weapons in his/her inventory and explore around on their own, they even open up some barrels and take the items inside them which is quite helpful when you're lazy to do that, but the AI also somewhat stupid when it comes to healing. They tend to waste herbs and medkits on you even when you didn't really need it. Like all Resident Evil games, Resident Evil 5 sometimes require you to keep your hands on the keyboard in some event, like get ready to press the ""F"" key to shoot zombies that is going to kill your partner.Resident Evil 5 graphics are good, sometimes a bit cartoonish because sometimes I see a black lines on the edges of the characters, but it's good. Performances of Resident Evil 5 is also great now, no lags, leaks or whatever.I recommend Resident Evil 5.Rating 8/10			"

												Ah, the Resident Evil franchise: a series of games which changes genres faster than I can type ""zombie.""Zombie.See?! It just changed genres! What the hell! I was being chased by a bald guy in a trench coat earlier this morning, and now I'm chasing a longcoat-wearing blondie who wears sunglasses indoors!But what did you expect from a name like ""Resident Evil""? It was acceptable with the first game, since it took place in a mansion. Then they moved to a whole city, and then a country; now it's set in the African continent, and we really should've gotten the memo with the second game.So, Resident Evil 5. What's new? Well, this is the first RE title with co-op; which means that you better play this with a friend, or suffer the consequences of an unreliable AI, which serves the same purpose as Lydia from Skyrim: carrying extra baggage. Do you remember how to conserve ammo in RE4? You either run through the ganado horde, or stagger them with a bullet, then come up close with the knife, right? Now there are new melee mechanics, where you can deal damage if you're close to a staggered (or grounded) enemy. Thanks to that, the knife has been relegated to the role of box cutter. The manual save typewriters and the item box had been replaced by a checkpoint system and end-chapter shop respectively. Overall, it's almost the same as RE4, with fine-tuned mechanics to support the faster-paced, action-oriented gameplay.And there you have it.			"

												I never really played any of the RE games. I heard, of course, about the franchise but that is mainly attributed to the films with the Ukrainian model Milla Jovovich. I bought this one on Steam sale many years ago but only recently have I been able to find someone to complete the game with.And this is an important part to mention: the game is playable with somebody else as there are two protagonists. In case you do not find any one the A.I. can take control of the 2nd player but does a horrible job. So, grab a friend and make sure you also have a Live account as this is the 2nd annoying thing in this game - it still uses an already obsolete service. Once you start a game only via Live can you send the invite and of course the achievements are logged there.Now that we have settled these two things we can move on to the actual game itself. The story and the cutscenes are VERY cheesy, however, the cutscenes pack a punch! There are more than 50 videos that are all replayable from the main menu. They are awesome! Cheesy but very-well made! There are 6 chapters divided up further into a couple of stages; you easily spend roughly 15 hours with the first playthrough.The game itself is difficult at times: the gameplay itself is a bit ""redundant"" as no dodging is possible and when aiming your character cannot move, at all. You rely on each other and there are certain stages where you have to cooperate closely - only one of you can move while the other must provide protection. Also, bullets are limited so you have to carefully make every shot as each bullet counts.Are you annoyed by quick time events? Well, RE 5 has many of those. During the cutscenes and also during boss battles. Some combinations popping up require some getting used to and these should be hit hardly very quickly. Once you have familiarised yourself with the RE characteristics the game can be enjoyed, quite much. In fact, there are many collectibles and as weapons upgrades can be purchased with the collected treasure all upgraded weapons can be transferred to a 2nd gameplay. Just make sure you pick the New Game + option from the main menu. New difficulty is also unlocked if you want more challenge.I liked this game. Not really my favourite franchise and will not necessarily go and pick the rest but in case you want to try something new this is easily a good game to pick.

												I've easily logged 500 hours on the Xbox 360 and I'm coming to the conclusion I will be spending another 500+ hours here on Steam. One of my favourite games of all time - with mercenaries and helping newbies with missions gives this game a bunch of replay value. On Xbox the quicktime events were quite easy - sure you might miss one by accident but holy mother of ♥♥♥♥ on pc it is another story. Never has my heart pounded so fast dreading what combination will be next: e and v? what kinda combonation is that? especially when you have 1/2 a second to react to it and when in co-op and you ♥♥♥♥ it up.. it has to be one of the lowest moments in your life. Anyway, maybe it's because I'm just bad with a keyboard - you guys might find it easy but for me.. god damn.Like I said one of my favourite games of all time and the quicktime event just gives me something new to master.10/10 Complete global saturation			"

												Don't buy this from Steam as a packaged with for examle RE4 and RE 6. If you can not get this stupid game to install and plya due to windows marketplace installation you are screwed. I tried to get them to compensate me with another game or try to help me get it to work, I got no reply and that I am not given my refund or credit even though I did not play the game. Because I bought the game RE4,5 and 6 and have finished playing RE4.. doing so made it certain I was not allow to get my refund or credit for RE5. So better buy this game by itself and install and try to play it. If it  does not work, get your money back!!!!. The Window security is damn bloody nuisance. Steam should have gotten Microsoft to take that stupid thing out if they intend to market this in STEAM to us. They are not making it easy for us to use what we paid for.			"

												I remember playing this on Xbox 360 CO-OP with my friend and we completed the whole game :) amazing times!I deeply love the Resident Evil series, they really got the zombies, missions, and story right. If you are like me, a gamer that loves zombie stuff this game is highly recommended! It's so good.The PC version of this is offcourse amazing too but i did see some bugs here and there, but its fine.The graphics are good on pc, works awesome with a controller too. Everything plays well and I havent recognized any problems yet.This game I recommend you getting asap, since its really good. And yes its worth the fulll price.Questions:Will it run on a older PC? Yes it will, its not demanding and its pretty ok optimizedIs it a long game? The story is pretty long yeah, but there is also a awesome co-op mode, and other missions to enjoy.Does it feel like a real resident evil game? Offcourse!All in all a classic game and a masterpiece. go and buy it!			"

Now, this time, follow Captain America and Princess Niaobi as they conquer somalia in an attempt to stop the spread of aids festering in northern Iraq.

Barry ♥♥♥♥ing Burton. Mr. RevMyChainsaw.  Giant ♥♥♥ Fish Monster 2.0 and many more memorable cast members. When you think you've had enough, this games absolute godlike ability to make you face your fears crushes your hopes for anything worse that could possibly come from award winning developers ComicCons. Included in the game are many dazziling weapons such as: A HandgunA Second HandgunA MagnumA Second MagnumThree Shotguns2 Assault Rifles2 Smgs2 Sniper RiflesAnd of Course a Rocket Launcher. Because a War in Kenya would never be complete without an Ak-47 and RPG bundle thrown into the mix.Face off agaisnt thousands of identical quadseptituplets as  you discover their fetish for bondage and large pointy axes asthey swing their generic african farmers tools that somehow haven't cleaved you in two yet. And when you tire of the endless slaughter of people who are too stupid not to scream when they charge at you, prepare to do battle with actual ethiopian warriors who had the common sense to upgrade to something that can kill a man from at least 10 feet.That is unless you happen to have a stock pile of Cannibis CAUSE THAT ♥♥♥♥ LITTERALLY HEALS YOU QUICKER THEN 2 AND A HALF MONTHS IN POST SURGERY RECOVERY.Find out just how far the rabbit hole goes and how much white society has oppressed, abused, and neglected the poor saudi arabians in: Resident Doorkickers 5: A tale of two ethnicities.Also since you're white you automatically obtain super human strength and can punch a 20 ton boulder straight into a volcano!

""COME ON!""""COME ON!""COME ON!""Using this feature I was able to slowly eat away at my friends sanity. In any given situation I would scream ""COME ON!"".

												After a while it's now time for a new review, after almost 50 hours and 48/50 achievements (from the main game) and 0/20 (DLC's) i had really fun playing this game, i played it through the highest difficulty and it took me a long time to master it (played alone, died often シ ). It has a lot from RE4 and new things, here is a list what i noticed during my playthrough: Pros:-4 difficulty levels (Amateur, Normal, Expert, Professional)-On higher difficulty the game becomes very challenging (one mistake leads to death)-Around 70 achievements to unlock (takes time and patience, many playthroughs guaranted)-A lot of weapons (from pistols to machine guns or a Gatling Gun, Bow-Better Graphic and Sound (compared to RE4)-Controlling via Keyboard or Gamepad works fine-Good story, but it was more a shooter game than a horror story game (like in RE4)-Via Co-op you can play the game with a friend-Leaderboards and the old known ""The Mercenaries""Cons:-Ai-Partner (Sheva or later Chris) are sometimes watching clueless around or doing nothing when u are about to bite the dust, so i recommend to play with a friend on higher difficulties or u get really angry sometimes (like me ❤ )-At some level i had a bug and had to download a user written bugfix to fix it, else i would't have finished the level (the community hub forum helped me to find the right bugfix -> keycard-boss not spawning)-U have to buy a DLC to finish 20 from 70 achievements (i really really hate those kind of stuff)My Result: As a fan of the Resident Evil Row, i can totally recommend this game, it has some annoying things but in general it's really entertaining, a lot of things i like where copied from RE4 (e.g. Cut-Scenes). The game becomes more funnier, if u can play it with a friend. Playing alone is a lot more challenging. Till today i have no clue why u get a serial number when u buy this game (i never needed it ingame). Have a good time and thanks for reading. ★			"

												Why am I even here reviewing Resident Evil 4?Everyone already knows this game is totally awesome and...oh wait.This review is supposed to be for RE5.Hmm...Depending on who you talk to, RE5 is either a respectable entry in the franchise, just another bro-op shooter, or the beginning of the end. I belong to the ""I think RE5 is simply a great game"" camp. It's entertaining, has a lot of good ideas, and how can anyone not love Mercenaries? With the recent transition to Steam I had to give the game another (3-4) playthroughs and tell you all about it.""Uroborus will be released into the atmosphere ensuring complete global saturation."" This memetic line -- spoken by a man with evil eyes -- from one of the few unskippable scenes in the entirety of RE5 explains the plot. I can't recall any of the rest. Capcom used to develop arcade games, so every now and then these storylines seep into their console titles. While it's easy to write this game off as dumb action movie shlock, I think we have to look deeper. After all, dumb action movies are released every day, yet hardly any of them are on the level of Die Hard. Let's start with the most important aspect: the mechanics. Yep, it's that word again. Everytime I review a crappy beatemup on Steam I have to mention the mechanics. Capcom has made some of the best beatemups ever: Aliens Vs Predator, Cadillacs & Dinosaurs, Final Fight, Dungeons & Dragons, and so on. They've attained mastery of mechanics as far as I'm concerned. With this knowledge, they can do everything from fighting games to third-person shooters. When somebody puts out a crappy beatemup, I know that they have no business making a game in any other genre (except for maybe a turn-based RPG). But what is mechanics? Everyone has their own definition, but I look at it as the player's relationship with the world. This covers every action, no matter how subtle. This can be everything from the height and arc of Mario's jump, to what happens when a flying axe is shot, or how much space is necessary for a mayor to dodge a punch. Great mechanics work when you never notice them. It's supposed to be seamless, so when you dodge a thousand bullets in a 2D shooter, you feel like you've been doing it since birth. The most prominent aspect of these great mechanics is in how the weapons feel. Each gun has its own characteristics, and using them properly is exciting and rewarding. Majini also respond appropriately depending on where you shoot them and what they're doing. This goes beyond shooting them in the head or in the knees to setup a melee attack. There's other tricks like clipping a shoulder, which causes their arm to fly back. This can be useful if an enemy is carrying dynamite, and it's just out of the player's sights.It also can't be stressed enough how effective unrealistic or overly ""gamey"" mechanics can be. When you're surrounded by monsters in any other game, your first instinct isn't to punch the one that's staggering. In RE5 however, that maneuver can buy you precious invulnerability. All too often, videogames give you these cool techniques you can perform, but they leave you open to attack, so they're never used. Providing an incentive is key, it empowers the player, makes them more willing to take risks, and thus have more fun. In the interest of balance, not every game should function in this manner, but it suits the later RE games extremely well. In keeping with the arcade game theme, RE5 is best-described as a compatibility shooter. Cooperative? That's the term I'd use to describe Borderlands or something. Sometime in the late 90s/ early 00s, Arcade light-gun developers like Sega & Namco started pushing the compatibility aspect. When you played a light-gun shooter like Let's Go! Jungle or Deadstorm Pirates, end-of-level ratings weren't given just to you. When you played with a friend, a loved-one, or even a complete stranger, it was the relationship that was rated. This meant that if you were doing stuff like hogging all of the enemies or allowing your partner to take damage, you and your partner would get punished with a lower rating. In a way, two people that performed admirably in a light-gun game could be considered lifetime best-friends, lovers, etc. RE5 is designed along those same lines, that's what makes it a compatibility shooter. The next time you play RE5, keep an eye on your partner. Sure there are plenty of moments that force the co-op angle, like the shared QTEs, or those times where you have to cover your partner while they do something, but I'm talking about all of the subtle aspects. For example, note the laser-sights. This isn't just a holdover from RE4. You can see where your partner is aiming, so you know when to cover their back. Enemies tend to come from multiple directions, so situations where you do the lion's share of the work are few and far between. Over time you develop a sense of what your partner is thinking. You know when they have a situation handled, or when they need to be bailed out.There's also the context-sensitive B button. When you give someone a herb, pressing the B button will say ""Thank you"", and you'll hear some variant of ""Nice!"" when your partner nails a sweet headshot. Typically, when you perform some action in spectacular fashion, you'll see ""Great!"" pop up on-screen or hear it spoken (My personal favorite is ""Nice Driving"" in Daytona USA. This is a holdover from the arcade days. Arcade games are short, and your actions have immediate consequences. When you do something right, the game pats you on the head. RE5 is designed so that you and your partner are expected to pat each other on the head, thus we have the B button.RE5's campaign is altogether solid, but it has some definite mis-steps. Boss-fights in RE games tend to be generally hit or miss. More often than not they're about taking advantage of clumsy AI path-finding or shooting large glowing targets with the magnum. RE5 has all this, and a bullet-sponge turret boss to boot. There's also the 5-2 boss, which screams ""Use a rocket launcher on me"". Also, while not-zombies with guns aren't a huge deal to me, they're a massive pain in Professional mode. This, combined with the ridiculous short revival time (you have to be right on top of your partner to save them), is just annoying. For the most part though I think RE5 is solidly put-together. It pushes the compatibility elements quite well.Mercenaries is absolutely perfect. There's no need for a wall of text to explain why.Altogether, RE5 is a very satisfying game. Give it another go if you haven't already.			"

												I played the first resident evil with Chris and i only had a butter knife to fight zombies and he (Chris) was a slow pace chunk of polygons!But the story was captivating, and scary... a true horror game!But this.... pumped and beefed up Chris, a partner who likes to put her head between    my target (armed with machete) and my shotgun can only spell disaster! RE series are downgrading the misterious side of story and horror/thriller/drama plot, and going to the muscular type/ extremely rubbery hansom heroes, shooting no sense zombies or infected people with a variety of weapons that also dont make sense!Bosses are super easy, and the game develops for you to win, not to offer challenges. Forget story or any kind of plot, you'll have plenty of reasons to pull the trigger and blow infected brains, burn bosses who keep talking and laughing instead of removing you from stopping achieving their world dominance! Its so ridiculous that sometimes is hilarious, my character died more often the moment I was laughing hard of those moments, than in real games challenges. :pThe cinematics are good, even in button mash option cut scenes. RE 4 was better and longer! RE 5 is just another episode (play it as fast as possible)The game is DX9 pure and simple, DX10 is for Nvidia 3D vision, Capcom said there is no difference between the 2 versions, so game crashes  are not from your rig but from the software. RE 6 is looking daunting after this....			"

												This is the best port of a game since Resident Evil 4. It's also on the same way length as the original retail GFWL version because none of the old glitches were fixed.There were obviously many things they could've tried working on, the lag glitches in co-op (shooting an enemy takes no effect for a good three seconds, in mercs that can be a massive problem), the fact versus has many crash problems, likewise with merceneries (and reunion), the save file tool not being avalible is also a really bad thing to do if you're releasing a game that has been around for this long. I've dedicated hours to replaying chapters and trying to work through stuff I've had done for years. It's annoying.We've waited so long for this DLC, but I could've waited a bit longer for a game that worked and wasn't repackaged cola.If you ever played the original retail GFWL Mercs, you probably know what I'm talking about; the amount of people running around with trainers, cheats and the amazing fact you can glitch having more than two people in a session. However I'd rather be in a game with four Midnight Weskers trying to figure out who I was meant to be teamed up with than this. We were all the same Wesker, someone died during the game and of course it was a terrible session, but it was playable. So far I've spent close to an hour trying to sort out a Versus game that never ended up happening and Mercs games that drop for no reason. By all means, it's great finally having the full DLC, I've been a longtime fan of Resident Evil despite the usual bad treatment you get as a PC gamer. It's nice finally getting to go through the full stories, but that doesn't exclude the negative, gaping problems they just overlooked with this release.			"

												Like RE4 its not survival horror but in my opinion is better as it utilises the type of co-op action to create a very enjoyable experience. The story is very interesting with fun bosses and various enemies, has lots of replay value with different difficulties, collectibles, upgrades and of course achievements. The extra mode mercenaries lets you play alone or with a partner to survive and defeat as many enemies as possible within the time limit (being able to extend it breaking time bonuses) on numerous levels with different characters and costumes which I found addictively fun. Overall RE5 is a great game but I would recommend getting the gold edition to ANYONE who buys this as you will get so much more worth your money including mercenaries reunion (like mercenaries but with different characters and weapons not playable in the original version), Versus- which can be fun with friends but has clunky elements and not the best matchmaking + 2 DLC story modes with fan favourite Jill Valentine- 1 being a homage to RE1 and brings back survival horror while keeping the co-op and modern controls. The ONLY real criticism I have for this game (more so the gold edition steam port than anything) is that there is quite a few bugs- occasionally enemies get stuck in mercenaries meaning you have to find them to kill them, the matchmaking is bad with private slots not functioning properly and automatically region locking who you play with [there is a mod which removes this however] and lobbies not being accurate. If capcom simply fixed these minor bugs this game would be perfect but they haven't addressed this and it's looking as though they won't with the last patch being over a year ago.			"

												Coming from a fan of the game on PlayStation 3 with a Platinum Trophy (or 100% Achivements), I can clearly state that this game - to this day - is really, REALLY, well done. I was going to buy the Gold Edition but the DLC is not really worth it unless you want both of the mini campaigns included.The game is tough at first no matter what difficulty you play on. You get to upgrade your weapons, manage your inventory AND A STASH in between missions/parts, trade gear with other players, sell treasures, buy missed and uncollected weapons, buy health items, anything. As you play on and upgrade your equipment, that's when you can raise the difficulty - either slightly or suicidally like I did. The AI isn't too dumb so playing alone isn't annoying and I haven't tried co-op just yet on PC but will tonight. Co-op on console was fantastic! I've beaten that game over a dozen times and keep coming back for more!Once you beat the game on VETERAN, you unlock a new difficulty - PROFESSIONAL. Basically what this does is gives even more replayability and challenge. This mode is basically a 1-hit-wounded-state difficulty level and requires you to carefully plan and quickly think on your feet. I'd have to say endgame, the hardest thing to beat on PROFESSIONAL is the ogre boss. :DEDIT: I've played co-op and it's fantastic! Just as it was on PlayStation 3. :)EDIT 2: Someone added me today and asked more about Resident Evil 5, so I'm going to post a little bit more here about co-op and the game's replayablity.CO-OPCo-op is very fun in this game. If you've played Resident Evil 6 it's almost like that but with one core difference. Trading. When playing co-op you take control of the second playable character and take on their role. During the game (either singleplayer or co-op), there are areas that require you to split up. For example, Sheva can access places that Chris cannot. Sometimes you'll both be separated and have to cover one another, which makes you depend on your co-op partner, so choose wisely with who you play with. Now, back to trading. In Resident Evil 5 in between chapters/parts, you gain access to your inventory, stash, and store screen. You can buy weapons or items, but not ammo. In this screen you can trade things from your inventory over to your co-op partner's inventory to share and help out. This is especially useful if you stock up on ammo and your friend ran out.REPLAYABILITYThis game has emense replayability. If you're playing for the first time (seasoned or recruit), it's always a good idea to start on Amatuer or Normal just to build up your arsenal and upgrade your weapons a bit. There's no harm in that. When I play, I always start on Amatuer for the first playthrough to unlock everything and get started. By the end of the game if you've collected all the treasures and picked up lots of money, you should have a few weapons maxed out and able to be upgraded with unlimited ammo in the main menu. After this I skip the other difficulties and go straight to Veteran. This is good because it give even more challenge. By time you beat Veteran you might have another few weapons to max out, but maybe not enough points to purchase unlimited ammo. What do you have to do? You have to beat more chapters/parts!I'd have to say that in order to fully unlock all the special content, upgrade all your weapons, and purchase infinite ammo for all of your guns, you might be looking at at least 3 or 4 full playthroughs. If I remember correctly, you get more points based on your rank at the end of a chapter/part depending on your difficulty.			"

												I have to remember how many times i wanted to have and play this, never had the chance unless i was getting over my buddies PS3 and damn was worth it. Not as all of the others RE's, it still packs quite of a good punch of amusement with it's content. Not like the olders ""survival horror"", you look at this sequel like a new innovation and there you have it. For the awesome way it displays itself or having the feel of a one man against many. It plays well and have it's good and bad just like any quality games.			"

												The Steamworks version of this game was heavily advertised as being free of the GFWL trashware - that's why I bought it. It turns out the most recent patch reintroduced and mandated the use of Games for Windows Live, effectively nullifying my purchase.The game also crashes if you don't have GFWL installed, or in my case, under any circumstances. It functioned just fine before the latest patch. The developers have basically abandoned the forum at this point, so if all of the proposed community solutions don't work for you, you're out of luck.If you enjoy archaic DRM systems and/or games that crash at launch, you'll love Resident Evil 5.

LOVE THIS GAME!Where do I start? I first played this game back in 2013 and loved it.After playing other Resident Evil games that came before it afterwards, I can agree that this is a completely different experience. However, that should not deter you away from this game. It's an amazing experience, and for me, I enjoyed the story.You'll probably like this more if this was your first Resident Evil game, but I still think it's an enjoyable experience.+ I didn't have any problems with the PC build, others say it's a crap port of the console but I personally think it's fine. Controls are relatively easy to get used to and can be rebound. Constant 100+ fps.			"

												Resident Evil 5 is one of my favorite Resident Evil Games. I really enjoyed Resident Evil 4, but it got boring after a while. However, Resident Evil 5 is very addictive and very fun to play. I can't get bored of it! On my crappy laptop it plays, surprisingly, very well! It may not be perfect 60 fps but it does sometimes exceed 30. Graphics are beautiful, and my brother's PC runs at over an average of 150 FPS. I, for one, am not knit picky about graphics or single frames, and I very much enjoyed how the game looks on my laptop. I saw the true quality while observing my brother's computer, as we played CO-OP Story Mode, beating Normal, and just finishing up Veteran, and soon Professional, and the graphics are unbelievebly astonishing! Great work, CapCom! I've been playing this game and beat it on different consoles such as the PS (or perhaps XBOX) for a couple years now and this game never gets boring for me! Thanks so much for an awesome game! ~3~			"

												I'm a RE fan, sometimes despite myself. The games aren't scary, but they are enjoyable. RE4 was, perhaps, the high mark of Capcom's decision to go in an action-oriented direction. The gameplay was fresh, the story was enjoyable, and the setting they chose was remarkably well done. I'll go so far as to say that they hit the 'rural horror where something is terribly wrong with the locals' vibe better than most proper horror titles do.RE5 came fast on the heels of 4, and basically has the same kind of gameplay with a reduced emphasis on exploring the environment and a focus on violence. The choice to move to Africa for the setting wasn't a bad one - colonial issues aside, there's plenty of things to be scared of out there. It provides a great excuse to combine dilapidated equipment and urban environments with a vast selection of rural locales. Nothing wrong with that at all.The Good:Chris and Sheva are both fairly fun to play, with a handful of distinct weapons to each one. They also have distinct combat styles, with Chris being a 'roid-pumped bruiser and Sheva being more of a finesse fighter. The enemies are more dangerous than RE4 - the humanoid enemies are better armed, and the non-human ones are tougher than their counterparts in RE4. There are new ones running around which are almost too tough (those damned mantis-ants, for instance), but you'll find a decent challenge throughout.There's a large supply of weapon and costume unlocks as well. The costumes are a bit of a wash (the club gear ones are especially terrible), but the weapons are solid. The minigun in particular is great to play with - it chews enemies to pieces, but you'll need time to let it rev up.The Bad:The inventory system is crap. There's no other way to describe it. The elegant attache case from RE4 was far better, but they swapped it out for a more traditional limited slot system. You'll find yourself swapping ammo and the like with your partner more often then you should need to.The partner AI is...okay, for the most part. Okay, but not great. They'll still waste healing items on you when you don't need them, and they do tend to get mauled if you leave them off by themselves.Wesker, your main opponent, has crossed over into Mary Sue territory by this point. He's your typical modern body horror anime villain cranked up to 11, bouncing RPGs and heavy caliber weapons like he was half Kryptonian. It's only his over-the-top voice acting and performance that saves him as a villain.And, of course...the race issues. Really, this isn't too bad for the first and later acts of the game. Most of your enemies are a variety of ethnic types, not out of line for the right parts of Africa. In the late stages, the Manjini you're facing are in advanced stages of infection, so most of those are a necrotic blue with obvious decay creeping in around the edges. Again, not a problem.The middle acts of the game, which take place in a tribal reserve and underground city...there's the problem locale. You're up against tribesmen who wouldn't be out of place in a mid-quality pulp novel, attacking you with spears. The game tries to hand wave this by stating the locals went crazy, and reverted to the 'old ways', but it's a bit crass and kind of silly at best. I don't think there was an intentional bid to be offensive, this is pulp story/action-adventure cliche territory, but it's definitely not a comfortable thing and I don't fault people who find it offensive.Would I recommend?Absolutely. This is a fun game, and issues aside you'll have a good time shooting monsters and running for your life when you're not shooting monsters. The voice acting is cheesy, the story is pulp silliness, the setting is great, and the action delivers more often than it stumbles. If the second act of the game doesn't put you off, you'll have a blast.			"

												Chris Redfield and Sheva Alomar are investigating possible bioterrorism threats in Africa: as it befits the series these threats become real soon enough and their investigation'll turn into a fight for survival against infected locals and B.O.W.s.Resident Evil 5 follows in the footsteps of its predecessor with an even more action-packed combat and fully fledged partner system: while those looking for a true survival horror will likely be disappointed the game is an excellent, if different, entry in the series.PROS:-overall graphics and character/ enemy models and animations make this a good looking game-nice soundtrack and sound design-a pretty interesting and serious story with a few twists, gone is also most of the cheesy dialogue-the action oriented combat is very enjoyable and fairly challenging-boss fights are tough and tense affairs -a considerable amount of weapons to find/ buy and upgrade-good level variety-story mode is quite lengthy, taking 12 to 15 hours to beatNEUTRAL:-controls can feel a bit clunky at times, nothing too bad but some sections requiring quick movements/ fine aim might feel harder than they'd be due to it: cover system is very awkward-there's still a few QTE cutscenes and, while I personally don't enjoy them, they're at least way easier than the RE4 ones-inventory management can still feel fiddly at times due to the limited spacesCONS:-the whole ""having a partner"" thing and the game being designed with co-op in mind can make single-player a bit annoying at times especially on boss fights-gone are most of the atmosphere and survival horror elements-a chapter (including its boss fight) is basically a lengthy turret section, it honestly was annoying to play and felt out of place

As said RE 5 leaves most of its survival horror roots behind in favor of fast-paced combat against a plethora of enemies: it's different but it works well and things can get pretty tense when you're facing a crowd of infected or a particularly strong foe/ boss. The story is also quite deep, interesting and tied to previous entries of the series: the fact most of the cheesy lines are gone is also something I truly appreciate. You'll meet both new and returning enemy types while exploring varied levels such as shanty towns, marshes, caves etc... this not only keeps things fresh but also requires you to change your tactics whenever a new foe comes up. The co-op oriented game design is a mixed bag, while heaps of fun if played with someone the single player suffers from it at times. Sheva's AI is a very good shot but her reactions aren't always sensible and she'll sometimes waste ammo, not follow you fast enough or generally make a nuisance of herself: this isn't too bad overall but I can only imagine how terrible it'd get on the higher difficulty levels. Bosses can also become harder than they'd be if you're playing with an AI companion as they might find it hard to maneuver accordingly or use their weapons at their best.Despite a few gripes with the AI and the co-op design Resident Evil 5 is an absolutely fun and rewarding game even if played alone: I'd say it's a recommended purchase for fans of the series/ genre as long as you're not put off by the change in pace and the lack of survival horror elements.

												First of all, sorry for my english. It's not my native language.I'm playing Resident Evil 5 since its release, in 2009 (PC) and after several hours of game with Games For Windows Live and Steam version, i have decided to put some of my thoughts here, Pro and Cons included.Resident Evil 5 is a third person shooter, an action game as Resident Evil 4. It has nothing do do with the first three titles with isometric view and ""tank"" controls.--Story mode--The story itself is nothing special, a very predictable B-movie.The most effective feature of Re5 is the coop mode: it can allow you to play the whole story with a partner (online only, split screen is not available for pc, unless you install a mod for the GFWL version) who may help you to beat the game and have some fun together, fun that you won't ever find with the AI partner. Each player has different behaviors and playstyle and that ensure a different experience most of the times, even if you have beaten the game once or more times.Re5 has some RPG elements: it's possible find credits in order to spend them buying weapons, their upgrades and utility stuff.--Mercenaries and No mercy Modes--The thing i said about the coop in story mode is valid in merceraries mode too, probably even more.The goals are stay alive, keep up the timer and combo, reach the higher score.- 10 characters with their different gears and melee attacks- 8 different stages- number of enemies is increased from 150 to 300 in ""no mercy"" mode- definitely better to play with a partner- good aim, fast reflexes and knowledge of characters and stages are necessary skills in order to obtain a highscore- the 5secs!!!!================================================================Pros:- decent graphics despite the age and the game can runs well on older machines- funny to play in coop- decent checkpoint system in story mode- good variety of weapons- good animations- good voice actors- rpg elements and stuff to find that may increase the replayablility (credits to gain, unlocking and upgrading weapons,  emblems to find, costumes an action figures to unlock, etc.)- it's not only about shooting, melee attacks are available for some ""street fighting""- documents that explain better the resident evil events- mercenaries mode (unlockable after beating the game once)- dlc are available to purchase (finally, after years of waiting)- the game is moddable (unofficially) and there are many fanmade mods to try (skins, modes, stages...)- cd key is redeemable on steam if you have a retail copy of the game- savegames import from GFWL to steam versionCons:- definitely not a horror game- predictable B-movie plot- boring to play in solo after a while- Steam migration has been a half failure considering all the bugs that afflict the game- ""mercenaries no mercy"" is available in solo only (unless you mod it)- local coop is not available in steam version- the price of dlcs is almost the same of the basic game- community is not that populated, basically only veterans still playing and newcomers leave after few time- customer service is a joke and there are many important bugs to fix (check the pinned thread in re5 discussions for a list of bugs)- fov is not customizable- crosshair is not accurate if you play with mouse and keyboard- AI partner has been made slower and less reactive in steam version- lack of ingame text chat- recent players are not visible on steam's recent players tab- your character can't move while you're aimingCons can be more than Pros but i think this game still deserve a try, especially if played with friends and/or some random players.

												The gameplay features a fun score attack mode based on killing enemies quickly enough before time runs out, and killing them in specific ways to gain extra time.As a bonus, you get to experience a comedic interactive story with Josh telling about his adventures at the docks, Chris punching a boulder, and Wesker monologuing about wheat.After 5 years, Capcom has actually finally ported over the Gold Edition content to PC alongside the Steamworks transition. Which is very great news, unfortunately it also means the game is now in an extremely buggy state thanks to the Steamworks transition. Hopefully it's something Capcom will patch and fix.			"

												It was around year 2009, my best friend picked up a copy of RE5 from the university mail room and came straight to my dorm room. We started playing the game around the afternoon and finished it at around 5AM, looking at the sun rise as we light our cigarrettes. Honestly speaking though, I thought this game was utter sh!t at the time. I was a huge fan of RE4, but this one just felt like an uninspired sequel to that with a crappy coop mechanics. I mean, this is a survival horror. I thought the concept of ""being alone"" is one of the vital elements for that genre, no? The game was painfully linear with stage based progression with no back tracking. All you do is just pewpew some enemies and then move on the next area to shoot more of those locals. Just like every other games out there.7yrs later, I bought this game when it went on sale and I'm somehow having a blast. I can even tolerate the terrible Sheva AI. I have no idea why I enjoy it now when I didn't before. Did I get old? Maybe it's the nostalgia. Maybe I just miss those care free days of being able to play videogames allnight with my best friend.....or maybe It's because this game is at least 10 times better than RE6. Fuq RE6			"

												My breh on da East Coast gifted me this game and we played through it and had a good time.  My biggest problem was trying to play the game with mouse/KB as I didn't have a PC controller at the time.  The game looked great and ran smoothly and Chris' neck was huge and Sheva was yelling at me and was half naked and... Then we fought Jill and there was all this sexual tension!!!!1  And then Wesker went: ""CHRIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIISSSSS!!!!""  So yeah, good times.HOWEVER: In it's current state I would not recommend buying this game.  Since the Steamworks ""patch"", this game is a mess.  Rather than an upgrade, Capicom (intentional mispelling) seems to have rolled the game back to an earlier beta version that hardly functions.  Check the forums and see all the bugs and crashbugs and startup errors reported.  Sure, I got to import my achievements and GFWL was removed, but DX10 was ALSO removed along with much of the game's playability.  And don't even get me started on the Gold Edition DLC pricing.			"

												This Resident Evil doesn't particularly bring any innovation to the genre nor the franchise, but it remains an excellent game within both. The gameplay is similar to its previous masterpiece in the series, Resident Evil 4. This time around however, you have a teamate, Sheva Alomar. The amount of weapons and upgrades is insane, the graphics are outstanding especially for its time, and the soundtrack is remarkable. The story is very well written, and the voice acting is magnificent. While the game strives for action instead of horror, it does an exceptional job in what it is trying to do. I recommend playing this in co-op with a friend, not only because teamate A.I. is poor, but also because the experience in general becomes a lot better. 8.7/10.0 "

												 Resident Evil 5 is designed to be played cooperatively from start to finish. For good or ill, you're either ideally playing with a human partner or you have an AI companion in tow throughout the entire game. This affects every aspect of the followup to the masterpiece, RE4: from the inventory system, the level design, the difficulty, the puzzles... it all revolves around two characters in play. It's a very different game from previous entries, veering more towards monster arena shooter than any type of horror or traditional tense atmosphere.   It's a very “brown” game, released in an era when that was generally used as an insult toward generic shooters with limited color pallets. Here it's fitting, with the majority of your time spent out in the sun bleached African slums and savanna. Playing as Chris Redfield with your partner Sheva, you're almost immediately assaulted by hordes of a new strain of infected locals. The enemies are numerous and nimble, testing your aim and keeping you on your toes as you try to avoid getting trapped in a corner. You still do not have the ability to aim and shoot simultaneously, so combat is a test of pinpoint accuracy and situational awareness. The first two thirds or so of the game feels very monotone in both look and action; you're fighting similar enemies in brown arenas, broken up only by the occasional on-rails shooting setpiece or boss fight.   The action isn't bad, just on the repetitive side and it doesn't hold up particularly well compared to newer titles that have improved and iterated on the formula. Most encounters boil down to popping some shots off while standing still, running away, doing a quick turn, repeat. Thankfully, the last two chapters add some variety and make the entire game better by proxy. Exploring a brightly lit, futuristic underground lab and a well realized cargo ship are nice visual changes of pace. Your tactics also get a major shakeup as armed infected now start to regularly shoot back at you with automatic weapons and come in armored forms, causing you to really think about where you aim before wasting ammunition. Mechanics like taking cover behind walls are also introduced, and the stop and pop pace is threatened by cattle prod carrying psychos slowly encroaching. The urgency and intensity explodes in the final act, moving the game's needle from fairly generic third person shooter to something definitely worth playing.   Resident Evil 5 would be unplayable if your AI companion sucked, but for the most part Sheva does what you expect her to do. While she does have the habit of getting in the way of your aiming laser from time to time or thinks it's a good idea to be up your ♥♥♥ when fighting a boss with an obvious weak spot on it's back, she's more or less competently autonomous. You have full control over her inventory, so equipping her with a sniper rifle and loading her up with ammo is a good idea as she'll provide decent cover support. The concessions to cooperative play actually streamlines the inventory system in a good way; the game does not want you to pause at any time, so hitting the inventory button brings up an easily accessible grid. Once you understand the options, using, dropping, combining, and swapping items between characters is ultra snappy and intuitive. If it went back to a Resident Evil Zero style system this game would have been a ♥♥♥♥ing disaster.   Like most games in the series, Resident Evil 5 is built to be replayed multiple times. Along with a New Game Plus mode that let's you play as Sheva in single player, experiencing her point of view during the limited times she splits up from Chris, there's also the straight arena, score based Mercenaries Mode. You earn points for playing the game in most modes which can then be spent to unlock characters for Mercenaries, costumes for the main game, collectible figures, visual filters, etc. There's quite a bit of game here. There's even a versus multiplayer mode, but that was garbage even when the game was in it's prime.   Included in the “Gold Edition” is two single player (well, coop...) DLC missions; one has Jill and Chris returning to the Spencer mansion from the first Resident Evil. If that sounds great, hold your horses; for some reason they took the time to model almost the entire mansion in the RE5 engine, then did almost nothing with it. You fight a total of four enemies... the same type of enemies... then have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Wesker boss fight and the whole thing is over in an hour. That's disappointing. The other DLC mission, Desperate Escape, is better though not really essential. It's a side story with Jill and some helicopter pilot that was in the main game for two minutes, and you're bombarded with enemies the entire time. It culminates in a Horde Mode-style defense where you're tasked with holding out against increasingly difficult enemies while waiting for a timer to tick down. It's not bad.			"

												I spent countless hours on RE5 on xbox 360. The PC version has great graphics and still delivers dynamic game play, however it does lack local co-op :(. All in all, definitely worth a purchase on sale.RE5 takes place in Africa with Chris and Sheva, agents of the BSAA group which contains bio-virus weapons. You are basically fighting zombies with some cognition about what's going on, they aren't blindly stupid walking around like most zombie games. Rather, these ""infected"" come at you from all sorts of angles and drop down from all sorts of heights to greet you with a chainsaw, machete, crossbow or just a good old fashioned hammer. Characters vary from simple opponents which can be taken down with a few shots, to heavier opponents that may charge or swing obscenely heavy weapons at you. What makes this game so good though? At first, I hated the game layout as it was tough to access my equipment menu or to pull out my gun. I should say that you CANNOT fire from the hip. You have to aim down your sights first in order to get a shot off. These two reasons sort of put me off but as I got deeper into the story, I got pulled in and liked how they intermingled melee with the ability to shoot opponents. You CANNOT simply press a button and start hitting someone. Just like pressing two buttons to get a shot off, you need to hold LB (to pull your machete out) then hit RT to get a hit off. This is one melee mode, the other involves ""stunning"" the opponents (boss's and regular opponents are susceptible to this) and then running up to them and pressing X which usually knocks them on their bum. Additionally, when the opponents are on the ground the player has a moment to curb stomp them (as seen in Gears of War). This melee mode is very particular, just as the entire game is made this way. You do not feel in complete control of the game until you've familiarized yourself with the game mechanics. Either you'll hate what Capcom did or you'll like it, simple as that. When you recognize when an opponent is stunned it makes a world of difference. I should also add when your partner is being held down by a zombie, the other partner can run up and press B to free the partner. I'm going to say it again even though I already said it, you'll either get along with this sort of game mechanic or you'll find it annoying you can't simply fire from the hip or melee at will. The movement controls over all feel smooth while the camera cannot be moved from an over the shoulder position. I have to give them credit for trying to include a wide variety of weapons from rifles, shotguns, automatics and pistols. On top of that, incendiary grenades, regular grenades are also included with a compliment of herbs that you can mix to heal yourself (or your partner on the fly). There is a slight RPG element to the game where you can upgrade weapons for better impact and a quicker reloading scheme. I would highly suggest spending your money wisely and choosing a weapon you know you'll be using a lot.  The graphics as I've mentioned are a lot better than xbox 360's version, everything feels smooth and the cinematics are pretty tight. The sounds are decent and do not really sound different from shot to shot, or when you break a barrel. The opponents also sound generically the same (unless you're facing a unique boss). Overall, if this version had local co-op it would get a higher rating. Since it's a PC version and apparently we don't play local, it's going to hurt it's score a bit. None the less, a great game and would highly recommend it on sale.RATING : 7.8/10Gameplay B Story / Campaign B Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability C+ Overall  B- "

												To be honest, it was first RE game, I have played since PSX.Because it has been created for the console, I didn't like the way, how to control the character on PC. Even when I tried to play it with an Xbox controller. This was one of two reasons, why I gave up on this game like three times before I finished it completely. Most of the things were very different to other shooting games like being not able to move while shooting or reloading. Also accessing the inventory, because I am not able to memorize what gun i set up for positions above 4..But as I remember all the RE PSX games I've used to play - the story is touching your heart. You wanna be the hero and having sexy Sheva as your partner is flooding your veins with an adrenaline. The surrounding graphics are not perfect, but thanks to that, the whole game runs smoothly as butter.Pros:Good storylineSexy ShevaBonuses (Cut scenes, costumes, figurines, unlocking game modes)Smooth runsI found just 2 small bugs by myself (and those were no big deals) - BRAVO!Easy ways to find ammoGood map navigationCons:The way of controlling the charactersSome bosses were really tough and you have to repeat the fight one hundred million times..You're not able to chat with your online partner and the commands are very limitedProblems with Windows Live Account at the beginning of gameIf someone wants to join you, it's not possible immediately. You have to restart the game from a checkpoint..The cons are really not so terrible I couldn't recommend the game. And I will surely play it yet for few hours!			"

Chris Redfield punches a boulder in this game.It’s not everyday that I think about this. But every once in a while, when I do, it puts a really stupid looking grin on my face. Don’t get me wrong. I love this part of the game. In fact, it’s probably the only part that sticks out for me. It feels like the part that the whole game is leading up to.I hate 40% of this game. I love the remaining 60%.Well, maybe the split is a little more odd. Let’s say 35-65.Chris and Sheva shoot everyone in West Africa.There will be no spoilers, don’t worry.In Resident Evil 5, you play as Chris Redfield, a 30-something BSAA (Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance. I know, right?) agent who’s seen some ♥♥♥♥. In 2006, Chris and Jill tried to apprehend Albert Wesker, the cool-guy antagonist. Jill gets rekt, and Chris denies that she died. Over the course of three years, Chris becomes obsessed with finding the truth and becomes the biggest cool guy in the BSAA.Following a lead, Chris heads to the “Kijuju Autonomous Zone” in Africa to investigate some B.O.W (Bio Organic Weapon) stuff. Sheva Alomar, who works for the BSAA’s West Africa branch partners up with Chris to meet up with Alpha Team, who were supposed to intercept said B.O.Ws. But seeming as they were side characters in a Resident Evil game, they all died. And – wouldn’t you know it – everyone in town is infected by ZE PLAGAS 2: Electric Boogaloo, which are the better version of the parasites you see in Resident Evil 4. Tasked with essentially finishing Alpha Team’s job, it’s up to Chris and Sheva to follow through and complete their mission.Sweet, Sweet, Resident Evil Gunplay.Resident Evil 5 is a third-person action shooter, through and through. You’re given nine inventory spaces and a wide array of weapons to fight their ways through streets, swamps, the wild and even a damn boat. By beating enemies, you can upgrade your weapons of choice to better fit your needs.This, in my opinion, is one of RE 5’s biggest strengths. The way guns feel and fire in this game just feels right to me. And there are quite a few guns to choose from, which is pretty awesome. On top of that,  by fully upgrading certain weapons, you can unlock ‘super’ versions of those weapons that you can fully upgrade as well. And the upgrades make a difference. The first pistol you get in the game can hold 100 rounds if you put the time and nairas into it. Once you fully upgrade it, you can buy a way cooler version with a three round burst. This is just one example, the other possibilities are pretty cool. The game starts throwing enemies at you that can prove to be pretty hard to beat, so it becomes pretty clear that upgrading weapons can really help. The game also has a little treasure system where certain enemies can drop jewelry, precious stones and the like that can give you an extra boost to your moolah. The enemy variety is fairly wide, although it becomes apparent that there are archetypes in every area’s enemies. You’ve got the big dudes that practically eat your ammo, the dudes that will one-shot you in a big, slow, telegraphed attack and the normal baddies that throw themselves at you only to get shot in the face. Something that keeps it fresh is the whole parasite thing. More often than not, you’ll shoot a dude’s head off to find a very sharp and flailing parasite worm thing coming out of his neck. These guys can prove to be a problem in mob situations and make gunfights a little more tense, which is something I appreciate.Something I DON’T appreciate, however, are the boss fights. This is the 35% I was speaking of. Don’t get me wrong, the boss designs are pretty cool, but the methods to beat them can get pretty boring pretty fast. The first boss enemy in the game has a pretty smart way of killing it, but everything past it becomes more and more facetious to defeat. Boss battles become slow and droning puzzle fights that don’t feel as satisfying that a boss fight in, say, Rogue Legacy or Bloodborne would. I found myself hating the game after each session JUST because of the bullcrap I had to pull to kill tentacle monster #2. By throwing these bosses at you, the game makes you feel like all the ammo gathering and green/red herb farming was JUST for the boss.What made this game fun for me was the online co-op. The game gets a lot more fun with a friend. Not only is it nice to have a human partner rather than a slightly-less-than-half-brained-AI partner, but it’s pretty funny to screw with each other a long the way. Plus, your partner can carry over their items from their own playthroughs and upgrade weapons the way they see fit. This is easier than having to deal with managing BOTH Chris and Sheva’s inventories and weapons, like in single player mode. I’d recommend teaming up with someone you know, though. I’d say that public matchmaking can be a little risky, but no one really plays this game anymore.From abandoned streets to blood-stained metal halls.The game takes you through some decent settings, some of them forgettable. This game is linear, so you might miss some things here and there. Although this isn’t really a big deal, some of the levels you play through can look pretty drab. I can really only remember chapters 1 through 3 as gray and brown. There was a lot of gray and brown. This is a pretty grim game, so it’s not as bad as you think. However, I don’t think it would’ve hurt to make some more vibrant areas in the game. These vibrant areas come up later, but the second half of a game isn’t going to keep a brand new player playing.Resident Evil 4 players wouldn’t really like some of Resident Evil 5’s characters. They’re somewhat flat, and speak mostly in reactions and observations. Chris has depth, because he’s a veteran of the RE series, and for the most part has some pretty memorable stuff in this game. Sheva, being in the RE universe for the first time in RE 5, isn’t really all that interesting. That may be because she’s new, though. Wesker, in my honest opinion, is my favourite character in this game just because he’s such a villain in this game. Like, unforgivably so. He’s condescending and cocky all game, and his voice actor did a pretty serviceable job conveying that attitude. RE 5’s story is serviceable too, and adds a pretty big point to the Resident Evil universe’s story line. I’ll let you find out what that big point is.I didn’t like the soundtrack. It might sound uppity of me, but I really like to focus on the music I’m hearing when I’m playing a game. It’s nice to have music to accentuate the mood and the action that’s happening in the game. Most of the music in Resident Evil 5 isn’t really memorable, except for a few ‘enemy encounter’ loops here and there. To be fair, that’s what most OSTs of this genre, and what every OST past Resident Evil 3, are like. So one could argue that it wouldn’t be fair to pick on the soundtrack. But I like being picky.Is Resident Evil 5 a great game? Well, Mr. Example Question, I wouldn’t say it’s great. I’d say it’s pretty good, and it would be better if it didn’t have annoying boss battles in it. Would I recommend it? To those who want to play a pretty good third person shooter with some exciting moments through out the game, totally. To those who want another great Resident Evil game like RE 4 or 2, maybe not. To the latter group, go into Resident Evil 5 with a lot of patience, and you’ll enjoy it more.			"

												I have many fond memories playing this game with a friend in a basement where it was barely large enough for us to sit down comfortably. We continued to beat this game multiple times on the same console, never getting tired of getting the same loot or fighting the same enemies, always wanting to try out something more. Eventually i got it for myself on my own console and enjoyed almost every minute of it.I love this game, its the first resident evil game that i played where everything felt right. Besides chris eating a rerigerator pre-game since RE3, he throws his weight around in the right ways and there are many points in the game where i was truely smiling at how much fun i was having. If you have a close friend that you want to enjoy this game with or even if you want a someone chill game to play in your free time, i definetely recommend this game. Sheva has the IQ of a bay of hay but it works out in the end.			"

												Nice CO-OP action game with unique gameplay, lots of unlockables and content after end game. Gold Edition has more DLC: Story, Versus, mercenary modes, costumes. Solid port, runs very very well, and looks pretty good for how old it is, but the brown and grey tones tend to make the game look stale. Theres a decent amount of graphical options to change, but most systems should be able to run this game.You can switch between KB/M and Controller at anytime, however the laser sight is replaced with a horrible crosshair for KB/M. Controls on the KB/M are rebindable and but mouse movement seems to have some sort of smoothing. Controller are presets from orginal Resident Evil 4 and different RE5 control schemes.Connecting to other people can be a problem at times due to a network issue or something else, and waiting for a random host to either restart or get to a checkpoint can get annoying at times.For the story there's really not much to say, the story unravels itself as the game progresses.

												As someone who played this on the ps3, I have to say this took many hours of my life away. It is a fantastic Resident Evil game and it's content are hours of fun. Its story is great and has many awesome features that can be unlocked after playing through the story once.  It has an excellent CO-OP system with an annoying command voice spam that you can yell at the other player. Ohhhh i will never forget the voice command spam. Good TimesFrom porting over to PC from PS3, I have to say, It is pretty well optimized and the controls are pretty simple to get use to, but I will warn you. The turning it absolute ♥♥♥. It takes 50 billion years to turn. From time to time, you'll be heading in the right direction when your character turns out of no where. Now you're facing behind you like a moron.For my last say in this review, if you're questioning if you should get it, I'd say go for it, play the first hour or so of the main story, and if you don't like it, simply return it. It will not hurt to try this awesome game, and i highly recommend you do try it!			"

												The title says it's Resident Evil but it's far from a true survival horror experience. It's an action game. There are no save points, it's checkpoint based. All that is OK as long as your expectations are established. I played through this multiple times on PS3 and enjoyed the co-op aspect and wanted to experience it on PC with friends. Sadly co-op doesn't seem to work. I can't tell whether this is Capcom's fault or Microsoft's poor GFWL solution. There doesn't seem to be any support for this game anymore so neither Steam or Capcom can give me an explanation on why I keep getting ""Game session canceled"" when attempting to play co-op games.Edit: 3/6/2016: So GFWL is finally gone and replaced with steamworks and the co-op experience is now fully playable. It's hard for me to change my recommendation from NO to YES because of lame the story is, but when you're playing the RAID mode or through the campaign with a friend, it's definitely enjoyable. The game is definitely middle of the road when it comes to grading.			"

												The first Resident Evil game where they got the controls right.  This is a huge improvement over RE4's transition controls.  You finally have good contorl, while still feeling constricted and clausterphobic when the enemies close in. The coop mechanics are a load of fun if you have a friend to play with.  Despite what others say, I didn't find the AI bad either.  They will eat through your ammo like there is no tomorrow early on, but later that balances out well.  No an issue at all once you have the bow and arrow for them to use.  I found the coop gameplay to work well, and when forced to split up I suddenly would feel a sense of dread and fear at the risk of getting grabbed and not being able to rely on help.The levels have great variety from one to the next.  Some don't entirely make sense, but it still makes for a great adventure.  New gameplay styles are introduced often with each level.  Exploration is always rewarded as well.			"

												Resident Evil...5!Resident Evil returns with yet another entry into the survival horror genre. This time, you are placed in the shoes of Chris Redfield who is partnered up with Sheva Alomar to get rid of a terrorist threat in Africa, as sanctioned by the Bioterriorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA).Story: The story thrusts the player into Kijuju, a fictional region of Africa. It starts slowly but becomes interesting soon after you have a first encounter with Ricardo Irving, who is attempting to sell a bio-organic weapon (BOW) on the black market. Through a series of events, Chris sees a picture of what appears to be Jill Valentine (an old partner of his) and is determined to track her down and eventually, have a showdown with an old foe, Albert Wesker. Throughout the game, we see Chris and Sheva develop a strong friendship with each other through the fights they have to go through and the words they speak to each other. However, some of the dialogue between them is often corny and silly. The crux of the story is Chris seeing Jill in his new partner Sheva.Graphics: The MT Framework graphics engine Capcom used for this game still holds up well today, with textures being crisp and colours saturated. The environments are well detailed from a single leaf, puddles of water to the dirt on the ground. For a game that was released in 2009, it can still compete graphically with some games released even today.Sound: From the screams of infected African people to the roar of a mighty monster, each sound effect is chilling and done to great effect. They are also quite distinct from each other, so it is easy to tell what enemy you are facing just by hearing the sound they make. The voice acting of the different characters were also pretty good I thought. Typically, Resident Evil games have awful and cringy voice acting but I found that in this game, Chris Redfield's voice in particular was great as was the villainous voice of Albert Wesker. Props to Capcom for improving the voice acting for this title in the franchise.Gameplay: In short, the gameplay is fantastic and very fun. Capcom has improved the way the inventory system works, by making it easily accessible through the press of the 'e' button and allowing for the player to switch out weapons in real-time. The side effect of this, is that it increases the tension of the game as enemies can still damage you as you are managing your inventory, though I believe the game is better for it. Moving your character around feels smooth and intuitive, although you cannot shoot while you are moving. I believe that this was a deliberate design decision from Capcom as to retain the horror element of the game. The gameplay is at its best when you are playing with a friend through online co-op. I've spent many hours playing through the campaign with a friend online and I have to say, it has been one of the best and most fun gaming experiences I've had. Resident Evil 5 is truly something special when you are playing with another person.Overall, Resident Evil 5 is an excellent survival horror action game. Although it is vastly different from its predecessors such as Resident Evil 1-3, it is a great game in its own right and deserves to be in any gamer's collection.8.5/10.			"

												Resident Evil 5 is more about action and getting awesome weapons than about horror. The game is nice if you like action games. Old RE fans will be disappointed though. There is no safe room in this game nor typewriter but a lot of useless minigames and features like unlimited ammo...This game is focused on co-op mode. You can play alone with a dumb bot and get frustrated or play together with a friend :) There aren't any classic zombies in this game, only infected people who are armed to the teeth :P The story is kinda boring and bland. You might have already figure out the whole plot once you see all the important characters.This game has a lot of issues at the beginning and there are still some bugs left which Capcom may never will fix. Luckily we have a great community here which created some patches and fixes for those issues. (no more region lock for example)Mercenaries/ReunionMercenaries is a gamemode that unlocks when you finished the game. You can choose a character and play on different recycled maps. (except the last) The goal is to make a lot of combos while killing the infected to get a good score until the timer expires. Having a good rank will unlock new characters.Reunion is the same gamemode as Mercenaries but with some new DLC characters which is not included in the full version.Untold Story DLCIf you want all the achievements you have to buy this DLC (yet another bait to milk of your money) There are some bonus features & campaigns which are included in the untold story DLC. One of the campaign called ""Lost in Nightmare"" is pretty good imo. It is focused more on the horror aspect and manage to entertain me through the end. The only downside is the short playtime :( Versus mode is one of the main feature in this DLC but sadly it is dead since no one play this mode anymore. (Also good luck at finding people to complete those achievements... I don't care anymore :P) The DLC is almost worthless without the ""Lost in Nightmare"" campaign. Buy it at your own risk!ConclusionIf you like action and smart zombies then this is the game for you! All the other ones should buy it only on sales.			"

												Resident Evil 5 is a fun co-op horror shooter. Unlike the classic Resident Evil games, this game is more focused on action and cooperation with either the AI partner or another player. Personally, I think that the modern RE games don't quite hold up to the classic ones, but that dosen't mean that this is a bad game. No, Resident Evil 5 is a great game. The gameplay is solid: It's a fairly slow paced shooter, with the from RE4 (or more like RE: Survivor) typical run, stand and shoot mechanic. There are tons of licensed guns in the game (I'm looking at you RE4 and 6) and they have great detail for a third person shooter. From a graphical standpoint, this game is still a sight for sore eyes. It got better graphics than RE6, which suffers from several low-res textures and low-poly mesh at many points. Movement is pretty basic in RE5, you can walk slowly, run and use a quick turn key. There's no jumping around, rolling or sprinting in this game, and in my opinion, that's a good thing. In RE6 these features seemed partially unnecessary and felt like they came straight out of a some Asian Kung Fu movie.The melee system has been slightly expanded compared to it's predecessor, you can now execute different melee moves depending on the enemy's body part you hit and the resulting stun animation. Every character has his own unique melee moves. You can also chain combos with your partner, the last melee attack of the combo will result in a very powerful attack like Chris' Haymaker or Wesker's Ghost Butterfly. The co-op mechanics are decent, although I feel like the game would have benefited from being a single player experience like RE4. It just makes it much easier for the player to dive into the game's world if you are alone, without a partner spamming ""Hurry!"", ""C'mon!"", ""Hurry!"".  Nether the less, co-op is fun with another player, and I advice you to stay away from the AI partner, because it's HORRIBLE. The inventory system is now in realtime (again, you can blame co-op for that) and is much better than in RE6. RE6 took a huge step backwards and gave the player a somewhat confusing row-based inventory which dosen't show all items at the same time. Weapons don't need any inventory slots either in RE6, so you will run around with about 6 different guns, lowering the inventory management the series is known for even more. The cutscenes are probably the most action filled part of the game, while they are greatly executed, some just feel a bit over the top. It dosen't ruin the game or anything though. The story has it's weakpoints (Jill being mindcontrolled, Wesker's weakness being the serum, the final boss fight), and makes me wonder why they haven't sticked to some of the earlier designs ( Like Wesker having one of his eyes stabbed out by Jill, and later the other eye shot out by Sheva. It makes much more sense than some serum that was never mentioned before.). It still is enough to keep you going, even though the plot twist in this game is a bit obvious and easy to figure out. Once you played through the main game, you'll unlock The Mercenaries mode, which is very similar to the one from RE4. Trying to get better scores can be addicting.Overall this is a very good game, but it dosen't quite hold up to the name Resident Evil anymore, not even compared to RE4, which was much more survival horror-ish than this one.tl;dr:+ Good gameplay+ Co-op is fun+ Excellent graphics for a 2009 title+ Nice variety of weapons and upgrades+ Mercs is addicting- More action focused than RE4- Partner AI is horrible- Story has some weaker points- QTEs during cutscenesFinal verdict: 8.2/10 "

												CARE SPOILERS. Resident Evil 5 people who love survival horror love 1-3 thanks the cameras it was always unique what comes behind the next corner, have i enough ammo, do i use the right weapon? 4 has mor enemies, the enemies was great, could hold with ceberus, hunters and reapers and the bosses could hold up with the yawn and Co. The story was good, take care of Ashely nervs many and many want the first developed Resident Evil HQ over Paris, but what makes Resident Evil was always Chris, Jill, Rebecca, Barry, Leon, Claire, Ada, Sherry and Co.. The Characters and the Story, if you want survival do Re4 on highest difficulty only with knife and gun without upgrades and get the survival back. Resident Evil 5 has a nice story. You come with Jill is dead, Wesker kills Spencer, Chris get to africa and get a new partner. Sheiva very long i dont like her, but now where i restart playing this game after 2-3 years i get to love her lovely kind character. Sure vs Jill she has no good cards but its fine. The game has really great locations and the best is where we find the source of the Prognito and T-Virus. What a place. The bosses are tough even on low difficulty they can eat much ammo if you dont have a rocketluncher or magnum on veteran and profi you can forget every pistol, you can only play damage weapons and hope to have enough ammo and not get hit because 1-2 hits its over. This game had so many qualities and extras, you can find so many weapons, so many items/ treatures, hidden objects and can fail at the level end. Sure some level you can finish quick and the price of the DLC after years was a bad joke, but the spencer mansion has some quality of older games and i had many funny times.I thanks Capcom for this game. Watch trailer, if you want a good game, buy it if you want Resident Evil 1 with the camera system and only new locations and puzzles, buy 0-3 and maybe Code Veronica and play every part 100 times. For me this game gets 90 %. Thank you for reading and enjoy your games :)			"

												This game follows up on the gameplay introduced to all RE fans on RE 4 and improves upon that formula in many aspects. It's been years since the game is released and after many playthroughs I've played on this game, its charm doesn't seem to fade off and its core gameplay is still pretty fun, albeit very simple and seems very lacking. One thing I have to say to anyone interested on buying this game is that if you don't have a friend to play the campaign with, then don't buy it at all. Having a real life friend to play it with enhances the experience tenfold and saves you the frustration of playing the campaign with an AI. Overall, RE 5 offers you hours of gameplay on end, has a ton of replayability and is well worth its current price. IF you have a friend to play it with, this game is a must buy. < 9 / 10 >			"

												Resident Evil 5, is actually the Seventh game in the Resident Evil series and was released in 2010. Resident Evil 5 is a Third-Person shooter/Horror game where you play once again as Chris Redfield, formerly of The original Resident Evil, Resident Evil Code Veronica and The Umbrella Chronicles, who partners with a woman named Sheva Alomar, which can be co-op played online or locally via split screen. The game takes place 5 years after the events of Resident Evil 4, with Chris Redfield no longer being a member of the STARS, Special Tactics and Rescue Service. Chris is now a member of the BSAA, Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance, who is on a mission to stop the sale of the progenitor bioweapon, which is a combination of the original T and G viruses. Without giving away any more spoilers, I will say that Resident Evil 5, definitely looks good considering it is 7-years-old this year. Resident Evil 5 also has a survivors mode and a slayers mode, both being competitive multiplayer modes, as well as the traditional single player and Two-player co-op mode. I originally had this game on the PS3 and it was both fun and fantastic as a part of the Resident Evil series.			"

												I want to recommend this game. I played it when it first came out on the Xbox 360 in 2009. I have been a RE fan for as long as I can remember and while the series moved from its horror roots to this more action oriented genre that by no means makes this a bad game.What does make it a bad game is that CAPCOM removed couch co-op for the PC release. Oh you can play multiplayer but only over internet with someone else who also bought the game. There are ways to play the story local co-op but they require modding or rolling back the game build to the GFWL version. And good luck if you want to play Mercenaries with a friend because it is straight up impossible without internet.The netcode isn't even good either. It is like they ripped out any dedicated servers they had and replaced the system with some steamworks integrated P2P crap (not like this can't work, but in this game...). You lag a good half second behind everything you do in someone elses game, if you don't DC first.CAPCOM really needs to get it together. Even if the above issues are addressed the fact that they existed at all are inexcusable. I will not be purchasing any more games involved with CAPCOM.			"

												Personal Input:If you play this game with a friend, you will share many laughs. I was able to beat the game with my pal in about 4-6 hours. We just had fun and tried to get the most out of the game. Now onto the review.Pros:Fun gameLot's of gunsNice (easy) boss battles....(easy as in it is easy for new player to figure out how to beat the bosses)Interesting settingWe got a muscle bound..cop? (Chris) Along with a badass girl (Sheva)Gameplay is nice (though it has flaws)Multiplayer works well with few to none lag spikes.Controller CompatableThe EGGS! (Those who played know what I mean)Cons:I am not to fond of the fact that we must stand still to shoot or use the meleeActing is a bit weakGets a bit repetative, but that is to be expected in most gamesAmmo takes up space in your storage on your character, (I wasn't too fond of this but it is only a nitpick)Melee is weak as hellUpgrading guns is expensiveNot too sniper friendly (More CQB than long range battle)Overall:There are many good things about this game, such as being able to shoot the granade or explosive on a ""zombie"" and have it blow them to smitherenes, or being able to roundhouse an enemy.But, there is also the bad that will stand out almost immediatly. (I do not consider the ""graphics"" into my reviews due to game's age and art style)However, this game is one in the Resident evil series and is extremely difficult to pass up.Buy it if it is on sale, or if you are crazy, for full price.(Sorry for misspelled words. it is 2 a.m. Don't ask what I am doing...........I am writing a porly written review)			"

 I DO NOT RECOMEND, AT LEAST NOT NOW. Download it first on a Torrent site or somewhere like that, AND MAKE SURE your rig will run the game with DirectX 9, not 10, not 11, but 9!  But why?  because the latest version of the game is locked to DirectX 9.My pc could only run RE5 on DX10, it always crashed on DX9 when i tried to change my game settings whether is was with an Nvidia 8400gs or my current Gtx 650 Now with the latest version there is no DX10, only 9. (DX10 removed under ""Performance issues"")I CANNOT PLAY THE GAME, I TRIED EVERY-FCKNG-THING I COULD! From today's threads on Steam's RE5 Comunity page, to bug reports on online forums from 2010 and beyondAnd from the people who could play the game, all i heard is bugs over bugs over bugs. Graphics are bugged. AI Pathfinding is bugged. Partner Trade System is bugged. there are even some invisible walls.At one point GFWL bothered me when i first bought RE5, Now Capcom itself is fckng me over.[10/7/14] Update: i downloaded RE5 from 'The Pi Rate Bay', DX9 cashes just like the steam version, DX10 works perfectly fine, i logged in using the KeyCode from my Steam's RE5 now i can play single player -- Still have to test multiplayer.[11/7/14] Update: online via GFWL still works. If your DX9 crashes, its up to you if you want to buy the ""KeyCode"" from Steam and use it to activate your 'pirate' game[sarcasm] Nice one Capcom [/sarcasm]			"

Only Co-Op15 hours of co-op fun with a friend.I wouldn't recommend playing it alone unless you're a big fan of the saga and don't want to skip the story of this game (which is pretty much tangential to the main story besides SPOILER -> Wesker's Death <- SPOILER).Even if you really are a big fan of the saga, I wouldn't recommend buying the Gold Edition because of how little gameplay time it adds.I haven't played the other modes but they're basically the same thing repeated from Re4, so... I'm not even gonna try.TL;DRif you wanna know the story watch it on YouTube, buy only if you're gonna play it with friends, because your partner's AI is worse than Koopas'.PS: beware of the lasers if you don't wanna lose a friend.

												It's a game best enjoyed in co-op play, but you can still have fun along the AI once you get used to its patterns. The graphics are pretty good for its time, no flaws there. The combat system it's not great but good enough and it's flaws can add to the survival and suspense tone of the game. But to get a good taste of that you need to play in the highest difficulties. The inventory systems is a bit clunky but you can make it work. I think they did a good job between the balance of combat and enemy AI. The mercenaries game mode is fun and challenging, but the DLC stories are too simple. In terms of story... it's not the best of the series but you can still feel the characters and enjoy them, especially if you know about the RE saga. With almost 200 hrs at the present time I can assure you that this game has a lot of replay value. Oh! and the soundtrack is awesome.Pros:+ Co-op environment+ Enemy AI+ Replay value+ Combat+ Extra content+ SoundtrackCons:- Inventory system- Ally AI			"

												TL;DR: Great game, not for hardcore fans of horror series, an action packed bro-op third person shooter, stupid ai controlled partner, cheesy action movie style story, presentation of game is great, gameplay elements in the game really shine. 7.5/10 Enjoyable experience.Things to note before reading review: I've bought Gold Edition and this was my first ever resident evil game I've played.This game is exactly as other people say an action face paced third person shooter. Its like a cheesy action movie with scripted explosions, quick time events, and even a car chase. A bro-op action shooter that never stops delivering the action. Did I enjoy it? Hell ya those 70 hours spent on the game were mainly messing around with randoms online and even beating the game on professional. Mercenaries is also a main focus of Resident evil bringing out and showing the fun and varying combat system. Story: Its a cheesy action packed third person shooter following the footsteps of Chris and Sheva as they travel through Africa on a mission from the BSAA. Fighting against bioterrorism they fight local zombie like creatures and fight things that increase in size, bullet soaking power, and strength. Another virus is back to plague African villages and tribes with some randomly placed journals that tell deeper back stories on certain areas, people, and experiments. There is a lot of depth to the environment that resident evil 5 has laid out but its over shadowed by all those action sequences and over saturation of actions packed missions.Gameplay: Suberb, Resident evil 5 really takes the cake as a co-op shooter. The only real problem I find in it is the quick time events that are absolutely annoying. You have a inventory system holding 9 possible objects of ammo, weapons, herbs, etc. You can find treasure to sell and use for money to upgrade weapons, buy new ones, and so much more. Shooting also has interesting aspects of being able to shoot enemies in the face, arm, or feet which will trigger 3 different types of melee attacks that you can choose. The depth and ability to perform combos is very interesting especially with a human controlled partner. This game play element is especially useful for mercenaries for comboing and extending time. They also removed GFWL and added steamworks. I never really knew the problem with GFWL that everybody finds.In conclusion, a great game in the aspect of game play. Capcom has really done it with this game Hardcore Resident Evil fans that wish the series would go back to its Horror roots will definitely be disappointed with this game. The story doesn't shine with anything interesting or new just overviewing another virus and some predictable plot points. Game play is great through the upgrade system, treasures, and melee attacks. Great to play with friends.7.5/10If this game is on sale get it. Highest sale seen by me is 66%			"

												A strong part of me has always wanted to truly and utterly ADORE this game (especially when I first played it on the PS3).  Not least of all because of its sheer boldness:  it's a horror game largely set not only in daylight, but blazingly BROAD daylight, and its sense of ""political correctness"" is distinctly lacking to say the least.     It helps nothing, in any case, that it starts with one of the most spectacularly unfair and clumsy ""action"" set-pieces you're ever liable to experience in a video game. But even after you get used to the discrepancy between the game's Michael Bay-esque ambitions and its almost wholesale borrowing of the somewhat ""clunky"" controls from Resident Evil 4 - such controls simply aren't suited to ridiculous onslaughts of enemies - the game still never feels entirely ""fair"", what with the copious quantities of quick-time events, some rather challenging ""shoot some stuff with a big gun turret"" bits which bear little resemblance to the rest of the gameplay, and an AI ""partner"" who wastes copious amounts of ammo shooting a single enemy which you're quite capably in the process of taking down with your knife.    Don't get me wrong, it's a bloody good game, and still stacks up very well in the current action-horror marketplace.  But it never quite manages to get the balance between the action and the horror quite right - preposterous bit at the end where your character PUNCHES A BOULDER REPEATEDLY, anyone? - despite the fact that Resident Evil 4 did a fabulous job of showing precisely how such a feat could be achieved.  At least it's a darn sight better than Resident Evil 6, given the couple of hours I've been able to tolerate of THAT one thus far.     This could'a been a contender for one of the all-time greats, but alas, it's merely a really, really good game which has sufficient charm and balls for you to forgive its numerous faults.  Still flawed, still fascinating, and still a bit of a missed opportunity, methinks.  (But no matter which way you look at it, still a darn sight better than those awful ♥♥♥♥ing MOVIES bearing the ""Resident Evil"" name.) Verdict: 9/10. (PS How many different ways can YOU say Sheva?  I believe I heard at least three or four different pronunciations during the course of the game...)			"

												I always find myself coming back to play this game just for the hell of it. The game when it was first released was a blast, and I played this game for over a year when I first got my hands on a copy. Last May, I repurchased RE5 on PC, and it was a great choice since me and a buddy went through the whole game is less than a week, unlocking almost every achievement. The only thing that made me upset about the game was the GFWL resetting ALL of my data on this game, so now I must replay through the whole thing. The only good thing about this is that I can relive the whole game yet again, and I am looking forward to doing so.			"

												Pretty cool game but with some issues for example i cannot unlock any achievements except one - that means i can't save game fortunately, I can join my friend save. Gameplay is good expecialy in co-op, graphics not that good but it is an old game after all, view model is awful tho similar to alan wake's i truly hate it. Overall rating 7/10, would play again.

												The latest in the Resident Evil series. It's a pretty cool game you play as Chris Redfield who now has shoulders bigger than his head as you punch solid boulders and shout words of encouragement to save the day, the second player also plays as some not so black woman who shifts between African and English accents faster than I can actually change weapons with the somewhat awkward inventory screen. The game has ditched its horror roots in favor of punching people in the ♥♥♥♥ing head and making said head explode! Your main foes in this latest adventure are Quasimodo, a Batorpion, an incredibly large man with a beard, an annoying woman named after Microsoft excel and an incredibly British dude who think's he is part of the matrix series of films...The game is somewhat short and is much better played with two players as you can really just laugh about all the absurd things going on. Overall though the game is a blast, even if you can't move and shoot. Pure high octane action at it's best.			"

												Despite what so many people ♥♥♥♥♥ about when it comes to this game, i have played it several times through and will probably play it again when the mood strikes me. it is of full Resident Evil quality, with many ques taken from RE4 (camera type, multiple playthrough encouragement). The only thing i really dont like about this game is the damned helper that uses all the ammo you give her immediately. i recommend giving her a shock stick and no matching ammo/guns. later, when you unlock somethiing with unlimited ammo, give her that. warning: it gets easier.     i have played all of the series, at or around release time, and this game gets my full recommendation. if you want oldschool RE, get the original remaster. if you are open minded and/or enjoyed RE4, you won't be dissapointed with this. Great game.			"

												Although this game destroys everything that Resident evil once was and removes the Survival Horror element from it completely, it still doesn't stop it from being an amazing game. This is a great game that you can play with your friends and comes with quite a few different game modes either such as the Campaign which I'm not a fan of but can be fun to play with a friend. The modes I'm talking about are the ones that keep me coming back to the game such as The Mercenaries, Versus and The Mercenaries Reunion, all truly amazing and similar to RE6, this game holds a different number of mods to choose from which will make the game look better and adds more replay value. If you're ever looking for an amazing Co-op game to play then yes it's worth getting this game however if you're looking for Survival horror or something similar to the classics then this game isn't for you and you should check out RE4 or the Revelations series instead.

												There's nothing like fighting evil with your best pal. Resident Evil 5 is best played in coop for sure. However, it stands on its own pretty well. There's a variety in locations, interesting enemies, and combat is satisfying. It's a lengthy game that will drag you in. That is, if you enjoy precision, reflex demanding situations, and mutating zombies. It's fun, for me at least, to methodically clear the area of enemies. Even if you don't have a friend to play with, the computer ally is good enough too. Pick this game up if you liked what I wrote.			"

												Is it as good as RE4? Hard to say. There's alot to like about RE5. A couple things not to like.PROS:-Solid, tight gameplay with great level design and challenging, varied enemies.-Co-op play is excellent and teamwork flows in combat really well.-Graphics hold up pretty well for such an old game! Run an enb to remove the color filter and the game looks fantastic.-One of the best ports you'll ever see. Seriously, this game can do far beyond 60fps+ on even a gt9800 on high settings. No crashes and everything runs like a dream.-Keyboard controls aren't totally awful! I usuallly recommend a controller with these games, but for this one it's not too bad.-Chris Redfield punching a boulder.-Dedicated ""Come on"" button.CONS:-While the Co-op Partner doesn't get in the way too much. it's resource management left a lot to be desired. Stop picking up handgun ammo when we don't even have one in our inventory, Sheva!-9 inventory slots, feels clunky to switch in mid-combat. Sheva keeps picking up Handgun ammo using up an extra slot.-Story is completely forgettable since it takes itself a little to seriously to enjoy it. There's no really dumb Leon S. Kennedy one-liners or midget Spanish Napoleon so give this game a fun side, nor do any characters really feel interesting or fleshed out. But when Chris punches that boulder, all is right with the world.- Some bosses have either a weird hitbox or vague strategies involved, mostly because it's not conveyed well. Final boss' hitboxes are a little wierd, and the  Jill  battle lets you shoot the weak point until it requires a QTE finish, which it doesn't tell you to do. (This is minor.)-That turret section is boring.Overall pretty dang solid. 9.5/10			"

												This game suffered quite heavily from previous-game-being-really-good-and-this-game-not-being-as-good-itis, so sadly I expect I will be a bit too harsh in this review. I can live with that.Resident Evil 4 realised that the whole concept of the series was quite ludicrous, and went very over-the-top and was very obviously not taking itself that seriously. This game goes back and takes itself all too seriously again. Boo. The story is just too damn serious, and doesn't have any fun. Also it doesn't make much sense. But then the stories in Resi games have never been great, so I suppose that's not really a surprise.The gameplay of this game was not particularly exciting, and certainly not very different to Resi 4 (but far better than that shocking Resi 4 PC port - play that on gamecube instead, or at least fix the PC version with mods). It looks perfectly fine and some of the puzzles are actually well done. There are far too many annoying quicktime bits though. Also parts of the final boss fight are absolutely stupid in co-op (whoever gets Sheva, I'm sorry you will be in so much pain due to that terrible button mash).Far from great, but not terrible either. Kinda meh. If you're a big fan of the Resi series I guess this would be worth playing, but otherwise give this one a miss.			"

												A very strange game.I'm not sure exactly how Resident Evil went from a survival horror game to a bad imitation of Gears of War, but... it happened.The game starts off in a good space and actually stays very entertaining for a significant chunk of time, but around the time the zombies start riding motorcycles (?) and you defeat a giant by sitting still on a turret and shooting at his feet (??) the game takes a rather weird turn for the worse. Enemies suddenly become bullet sponges and you spend massive amounts of ammo either locking an enemy in an animation until it dies, or hoping to hit the tiny weak spot that will eventually kill it.I would not put a vote of confidence for single player, but if you're going to play with a friend through the cooperative mode, you'll probably have a good time and share a mutual feeling of ""What the hell is going on?"" when you realize you're playing a really crappy cover shooter instead of a Resident Evil game.I mean, I get it, I played RE4, and it was not quite a survival horror game either. However, this is just weird and I'm not sure what I really think about it. I totally understand why longtime Resident Evil fans despise this game to the core.All that being said, I still had a decent time with this game, but it was quite the downward spiral from fun to what-the-hell?

												RESIDENT RAMBO 5Actually this should really have been called RE4 Part II or perhaps another REVLATIONS title, nevertheless I am giving this a thumbs up because I bought it in the Summer Sale for Six Dollars, if I had paid full price then maybe I would have differen't opinions about it.As others have mentioned  as far as gameplay and progression go this is almost a carbon copy of RE4, with a couple of really good (and sadly very short) ""Operation Wolf"" Type levels thrown in at the half way point, suffice it to say this was meand a big budget ""Switch your Brain Off"" shooter with the bizzare addition (experiment?) of an AI partner system for solo play which isn't too much of a problem for the First Half but then gets to be a BIG problem later on.  More on that later...Everything about this game is BIG, Cinematic and Bombastic and for the most part it looks really good even though there is a distinct lack of variety in the Scenery.  With a few exceptions the graphics are all a mix of South African Shanty Towns with Mad Max that make up Roughly Two Thirds of the entire game.  The cutscenes are done in that dramatic Shaky-Cam style, which was very trendy when this was released, and on the whole it holds up very well for it's age.  Running on a NVIDIA GTX 870 this is smooth and flicker free although there are some serious bugs on the Tanker Level that make progression next to impossible depending on what Spawns and what does not.So what of the actual Mechanics and playability?  Sadly this is a complete Train Wreck that is WAY too complicated to use and slowly gets worse as the game progresses making it virtually impossible without the use of a controller.  Actually things are pretty good until half way throuth the Third Stage and then, without warning.........It's ""Goodbye Resident Evil"" and HELLOOOOO QTE.......!!!!!Yes Friends, when it comes to the Boss Fights and later the Maze and Corridor levels you will spend most of the time either looking at the keyboard or controler rather than enjoying the action on the screen. The Intrusive Quick Time sections that invade the levels and the Boss Fights without warning also change the keys each time causing the player to be looking perminently at the keyboard and missing the action.  It is also in these stages that the REALLY BAD AI of the partner becomes painfully apparent and it will then most of the time blocking you in corners and getting you killed from then on till the bitter end.  There really should have been an option to play without it and I am Amazed that this was not offered.By this time CAPCOM had already gone too far away from what RE is meant to be and it is evident that they were listening to the ""Suits"" rather than the fans.  It is also evident that they were trying to be like the RE Films going so far as to transform Wesker from an interesting ""Bond Villian"" with character into an evil superhero part NEO Part Darth Vader.  The two versions of RE should have been allowed to exist as completely seperate entities.What we have here is really a long version of MERCINARIES.In conclusion I cannot really complain at Six Dollars, so it is for that reason I am giving it a thumbs up, but I would not have been so sympathetic if I had paid full price.PS Trivia......did anyone else notice that the music between levels is a slowed down version of the Ocean Theme from Mario 64?

												I grew up watching and playing the Resident Evil games and watching the movies and reading the books, and I have to say, the makers of Biohazard should be ashamed of this. The franchise has turned from a mindful game of puzzles and fun(horror, zombies, grotesque creatures out of a Lovecraftian terror) to a sad below expectations FPS. Resident Evil 4 had its spikes of worthwile gaming, but couldn't hold a candle to the others games, but at least as an FPS it held its own. This sad excuse for a FPS is a sad and downright depressing adventure for anyone who has loved the Biohazard/Resident Evil franchise. There's no finese, no love, no care, no intelligence in this game. They've successfully sucked all the delights that Resident Evil was known for straight out of this game.			"

												This game continues in the vain of Resident Evil 4s second half, which means: MORE ACTIONThe first half (roughly 5 to 6 Hours) is pretty nice, not really any horror but on higher difficulty (i played on survival) you get that survival feeling, e.g. scarce ammunition/healing items and enemys do a lot of damage.That was pretty much the good part.Capcom decided to ramp up the action and enemy count over the course of the game and it gets worse and worse.The pacing is awful, there are barely atmospheric downtime sections, they throw wave after wave of enemys at you ALL.THE.TIME.  I just wished for it to be over after some time. They completely drop the ball when introducing zombies with guns which are still surprisingly accurate and do tons of damage. And all this while keeping the tank controls from RE 4 and an annoying inventory system which is much worse this time around because the game continues in real time while you're in it.A lot of levelparts and (boss)fights also overstay their welcome and this game would have benefited from some streamlining, content wise. The whole finale just goes on and on and on.And don't think of playing this with the AI. Sheva is good at saving your butt when you are dying but the amount of failures i got because of her  not moving when she should, not hitting enemys but shooting half her mag in the air or standing in my line of sight. The game turns from decently fun to a real chore halfway trough, not recommended. Play RE4 or the HD Remaster from the first game instead.			"

												I don't reccomend this game if you want to play single player, I liked the game, but it was let down by having a forced co op character tag along with you when I only want to focus and play 1 character. The problem is it ends up so frustrating as the AI is very dumb, Sheva would keep running in front of me when Iam trying to shoot enemies and block my line of sight, it made me end up rage quitting as it's too damn frustrating having to deal with poor partner AI.Sheva is a hindrance, not a help even when you instruct her do do things it's done really stupidly. She does things like pick up and gives me crap I don't want.Don't buy unless you want to co op with others as the AI is too frustrating otherwise.			"

												Resident Evil 5 is an action horror game which was released in 2009 by Capcom. In Resident Evil 5 you will play as a BSAA member: Chris Redfield along with his companion Shevo Alomor. In the co-op mode you can also play as Sheva or if you have completed the campaign. The BSAA (Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance) has been made by governments to infiltrate and neutralize the bioterrorist hotspots, to restore safety and stability to various regions around the globe.  You can choose about 3 different difficulties: Amateur, Normal and Veteran. Once you beat the veteran mode, the game gets a new difficulty: Professional. The game is located in Africa, at a non-real place called Kijuju. You can find guns somewhere around the map from different chapters or you can buy it at the shop. You can access the shop by dying, completing a chapter and when starting the game. In the shop you can organize, buy and sell your stuff. The most valuable of them are the (hidden) treasures. In the beginning you start at Radcoon City, a place where the civilization hasn’t been affected by the bioterrorists. At least that was what it looked like… it turned out to be an infected zone by a mysterious masked woman. In the game you start without any weapons except a knife. Once you go to the objective you and your partner will receive a gun. After the end of the chapters, you will have to find against the bosses.The genre of the game is marked as horror, but it isn’t scary at all. The game didn't even have any jump scares. If there was then it could be in the cut scenes. Which I watched. The cut scenes are somehow exciting to watch and when you skip one you will regret it and watch it on YouTube or by clicking cut scenes at the menu option. The graphics of the game isn’t really modern, it is bad if you compare it to the new games that released this year. The sound itself really improve the gameplay, it is well-made. The controls are easy to control, if you have played the game long enough. The controls can you find in the game at notes, but I would recommend you to go to the control settings at the menu. The gameplay itself is awesome, but it could be better if there were other endings that was decided by the way you play. The ending of this game is somehow sad/bad. It would be nice if there was a better ending.Pros-	Gameplay is awesome -	Sound is well-made    -	Different weapons-	Different infected people-	Has trading cards-	Has Achievements-	Has co-opCons-	No skills or perks-	Bad graphics-	The game doesn't match the horror genre-	The partner heals you too fastScore:Gameplay               7,5Graphics	              5,5Sound	              7Co-op	              8Environment.   	      6,5Controls.                 7Difficulty	              6Average score	      6,8The game is good and worth a shot if it is on a sale.

												Try this game out though even if it does look bad oh man is this game awesome.                        I finished it twice and it still hasn't got boring (Of course though, I finished it twice on the Xbox 360 like 3-4 years ago as of this review) basically I'll breifly explain what it's like when you play it.You're in South Africa and you're currently there to investigate and stop Bioterrorism. You get dispatched along with a partner to help you alone the way and as you two greet and walk around you see things that are strangely freaky and unexplainable. An eerie uncomfortable atmosphere is around you as you look around just analysing the place when suddenly after hearing a cry for help you and your partner rush to the location of where the sound was to see what's going on! Were you too late? Did you save him or her? Who were they? What was going on?To be continued might I add...Here is a list of the Pros and ConsPros:+Amazing graphics for the time it was made+Good characters+Good storyline+Customise your guns (not like Call of Duty where you get to change everything) you can upgrade the damage, capacity etc.+You can collect gems/treasures+It has awesome boss battles+It'll take you about 20-30 hours to finish it if you're new to this game, it depends+There are somtimes mini puzzles in the game, you must do something to unlock a new path+The DLC is fun and adds a whole new level to explore+You venture off, and as you play you experience tough times+Nice variation of bosses with different weaknesses+Nice variation of weaponry+Find hidden emblems to unlock special upgrades+You will struggle (fun but challenging gameplay)Neutral=It's not like RE4 where you play alone it's more cooperativeCons:-Steam connectivity problems when trying to play with a friend (may occur but is rare)-I can't think of much else actually I mean this game did get 9/10 from IGN and Steam so my lack of cons may make senseHey if you don't like it then you can refund it! So there really is no mistakes you could make there so happy gaming!If you're wondering how long a refund takes, well for me it takes like 10-20 hours, add me if you wanna play.			"

												This game is a phenomenal co-op experience. Chaining melee attacks is a lot of fun. ""You can be the sniper rifle guy, so give me all the shotgun ammo"".Purchased first for the console, I later grabbed this for the PC after I heard about the additional Mercenaries Mode that allows for a crazy amount of enemies on the screen (single player only sadly). The controls are greatly improved upon from RE4, with the expanded Mercenaries Mode now a series staple.Get friend and play this game, then immediately flow into Resident Evil 6, where the action gets faster and controls get even better.

												The “Villain Most In Need Of A Hug” AwardAlbert Wesker. Need I say more? Best villain (Vas from FarCry 3 beeing only the second place :))As for the game, while it did feel a bit different than 1,2 and 3, it didn't feel THAT much different from 4.The setting mostly and the action elements that were constructed for the ""ease of use"" and in many people's eyes made the game a shooter.It's not scary, but I'm one of the people that say none of the RE games were scary. While not the best game in the series, it is surely one of the best CO-OP games in the genre in general.Which makes it a great game by definition, even if it didn't follow in the footsteps of previous titles.Mercenary mode was a load of fun as well, best one so far.Yes, it could be darker. Yet, I still don't think RE6 looks any better at all...I highly recommend this game, unless you only want hardcore RE action of the past, but than again, you would not be here at all.			"

												Amazing...After all these years it still holds up, graphics and gameplay wise. Imo the co-op was nailed in this game.Take the elevator scene, backs to the wall, horde of oncoming lickers and me and my buddy standing firm and holding our ground, shotgun and magnum in hand... epic. Thats what co-op brings to Resident Evil 5.That is the stuff of dreams of any original RE gamer. Take yourself back to '96. You and your mates taking it in turns to play, we dreamed of two player, this game delivered that. Ok not the authentic or classic RE experience, but RE5 does what it does very well.			"

												It's not a bad game, but not great either. It ran pretty well and sounded pretty damn well too save for one recurring glitch that made it look like my graphics card was dying (artifacting and flashing). All I needed to do was alt-tab out of the game and back in again for the graphical glitch to go away (for a while at least).Play this game with a friend and don't bother with normal or easy mode. This game is way too easy during regular gameplay. Some of the boss fights are hard to figure out but don't really require a ton of technical skill, just a good strategy.The pacing is not very good and I didn't find myself frightened or tense really at all. This is a co-op shooter with RE 4 mechanics, not a survival horror game IMO. It's fun with a partner, and has good co-op mechanics truthfully, but the story is forgettable and pretty silly in parts too. Get it on discount and don't expect much scary and you'll be good.			"

												No it's not as ""good"" as RE4 but that should not deter you from playing it. It had a hefty development process dating all the way back to that concept trailer shown back in 2005 and it didn't even release until March 2009. Yes, originally it was just Chris but Capcom cashed in on how easy ""co-op"" appeal is and with the whole racist backlash (That would be 10x worse in 2015, thanks tumblr) they threw in Sheva. It's still one of the best looking games of last gen even compared to RE6 although that's not much of an achievement when you look at RE6. Good music, good atmospheric design - By this I mean it's got a really nice murky urban feeling in the early levels of the game as opposed to being scary, sure it's daylight but it's Africa what do you expect? Story/Scenario is really stupid though, you're following up on things we know nothing about and we never really see most characters outside of cutscenes also for some reason despite being veterans Chris and Jill are both low ranking officers in an organization they started. Playing solo is a miserable experience having to babysit the AI and feed it your ammo and use your money to upgrade its weapons if you want it to keep up, the real experience in the game is the co-op. Having a responsive partner to use the voice commands given in the game adds to the whole co-operative nature of the game. Getting grabbed and being helped out then to quickly press a button to say ""Thanks for the help"" really makes it more satisfying that you have someone to assist you. The core gameplay itself hasn't changed too much from the series it's essentially ""RE4 with co-op"" having no typewriters anymore, no merchant what little remained of the core RE series to begin with is the tank controls. The controls themself take some getting used to and having being spoilt by RE6's masterful character control (The only good thing about the game) I had some difficulty playing it a while back but now it's out of my system I can easily manage playing it again. The post-game content is serviceable, as you go through the game you're to acquire hidden emblems that unlock content for you with the more you amass. Be they files on all creatures and people in the game, filters for the game itself, small statues that detail the models of the game or even unlockable costumes to which both Sheva and Chris have 2 each of. The game also contains the series staple Mercenaries which started in RE3 and carried over to RE4 and now RE5. The DLC content is also largely worth it having two scenarios that fill in the missing pieces of the story a lot easier granted you even care about it, two more costumes for Chris and Sheva (Well, technically only 1 each on PC since you get the other set you got on consoles PC had already) and a remixed Mercenaries mode featuring two characters from RE5 and two old returning characters from the first game in the series. With a fair amount of replay value and the likes or Mercs (provided the community is still alive) it's a game definitely worth your time even with all the flaws present the amount of time put into it is staggering compared to some of Capcom's later efforts.

												Resident Evil...5!Resident Evil returns with yet another entry into the survival horror genre. This time, you are placed in the shoes of Chris Redfield who is partnered up with Sheva Alomar to get rid of a terrorist threat in Africa, as sanctioned by the Bioterriorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA).Story: The story thrusts the player into Kijuju, a fictional region of Africa. It starts slowly but becomes interesting soon after you have a first encounter with Ricardo Irving, who is attempting to sell a bio-organic weapon (BOW) on the black market. Through a series of events, Chris sees a picture of what appears to be Jill Valentine (an old partner of his) and is determined to track her down and eventually, have a showdown with an old foe, Albert Wesker. Throughout the game, we see Chris and Sheva develop a strong friendship with each other through the fights they have to go through and the words they speak to each other. However, some of the dialogue between them is often corny and silly. The crux of the story is Chris seeing Jill in his new partner Sheva.Graphics: The MT Framework graphics engine Capcom used for this game still holds up well today, with textures being crisp and colours saturated. The environments are well detailed from a single leaf, puddles of water to the dirt on the ground. For a game that was released in 2009, it can still compete graphically with some games released even today.Sound: From the screams of infected African people to the roar of a mighty monster, each sound effect is chilling and done to great effect. They are also quite distinct from each other, so it is easy to tell what enemy you are facing just by hearing the sound they make. The voice acting of the different characters were also pretty good I thought. Typically, Resident Evil games have awful and cringy voice acting but I found that in this game, Chris Redfield's voice in particular was great as was the villainous voice of Albert Wesker. Props to Capcom for improving the voice acting for this title in the franchise.Gameplay: In short, the gameplay is fantastic and very fun. Capcom has improved the way the inventory system works, by making it easily accessible through the press of the 'e' button and allowing for the player to switch out weapons in real-time. The side effect of this, is that it increases the tension of the game as enemies can still damage you as you are managing your inventory, though I believe the game is better for it. Moving your character around feels smooth and intuitive, although you cannot shoot while you are moving. I believe that this was a deliberate design decision from Capcom as to retain the horror element of the game. The gameplay is at its best when you are playing with a friend through online co-op. I've spent many hours playing through the campaign with a friend online and I have to say, it has been one of the best and most fun gaming experiences I've had. Resident Evil 5 is truly something special when you are playing with another person.Overall, Resident Evil 5 is an excellent survival horror action game. Although it is vastly different from its predecessors such as Resident Evil 1-3, it is a great game in its own right and deserves to be in any gamer's collection.8.5/10. "

												Take RE4 and add in co-op, and you're pretty much there.

												It has potential, but has so many basic design flaws. You'd think after four previous versions of the game, they would get things right. Different mouse sensitivities depending on if you are running or walking causes dizziness. The ability to buy guns and not ammo just represents a bad design decision. Interactive cut scenes just cause death while you try to relax in between levels. An obvious console port that is painful to play with a keyboard & mouse; yet the inaccuracy of a game controller for first person shooting frustrates matters even more. The best feature of this game is the co-op mode combined with decent graphics, but frequent disconnects will keep you looking for something else to play.			"

												While the plot is like a dumb action movie, this is an engaging experience that takes the pacing and mechanics of RE 4 and refines them for great gameplay.  It's also the first split-screen coop RE title since RE 0 on the gamecube, which is an increasingly uncommon feature.  This is great fun with a friend, whether you're playing through the campaign or playing in the excellent Mercenaries mode.			"

												Resident Evil...5!Resident Evil returns with yet another entry into the survival horror genre. This time, you are placed in the shoes of Chris Redfield who is partnered up with Sheva Alomar to get rid of a terrorist threat in Africa, as sanctioned by the Bioterriorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA).Story: The story thrusts the player into Kijuju, a fictional region of Africa. It starts slowly but becomes interesting soon after you have a first encounter with Ricardo Irving, who is attempting to sell a bio-organic weapon (BOW) on the black market. Through a series of events, Chris sees a picture of what appears to be Jill Valentine (an old partner of his) and is determined to track her down and eventually, have a showdown with an old foe, Albert Wesker. Throughout the game, we see Chris and Sheva develop a strong friendship with each other through the fights they have to go through and the words they speak to each other. However, some of the dialogue between them is often corny and silly. The crux of the story is Chris seeing Jill in his new partner Sheva.Graphics: The MT Framework graphics engine Capcom used for this game still holds up well today, with textures being crisp and colours saturated. The environments are well detailed from a single leaf, puddles of water to the dirt on the ground. For a game that was released in 2009, it can still compete graphically with some games released even today.Sound: From the screams of infected African people to the roar of a mighty monster, each sound effect is chilling and done to great effect. They are also quite distinct from each other, so it is easy to tell what enemy you are facing just by hearing the sound they make. The voice acting of the different characters were also pretty good I thought. Typically, Resident Evil games have awful and cringy voice acting but I found that in this game, Chris Redfield's voice in particular was great as was the villainous voice of Albert Wesker. Props to Capcom for improving the voice acting for this title in the franchise.Gameplay: In short, the gameplay is fantastic and very fun. Capcom has improved the way the inventory system works, by making it easily accessible through the press of the 'e' button and allowing for the player to switch out weapons in real-time. The side effect of this, is that it increases the tension of the game as enemies can still damage you as you are managing your inventory, though I believe the game is better for it. Moving your character around feels smooth and intuitive, although you cannot shoot while you are moving. I believe that this was a deliberate design decision from Capcom as to retain the horror element of the game. The gameplay is at its best when you are playing with a friend through online co-op. I've spent many hours playing through the campaign with a friend online and I have to say, it has been one of the best and most fun gaming experiences I've had. Resident Evil 5 is truly something special when you are playing with another person.Overall, Resident Evil 5 is an excellent survival horror action game. Although it is vastly different from its predecessors such as Resident Evil 1-3, it is a great game in its own right and deserves to be in any gamer's collection.8.5/10. "

												No it's not as ""good"" as RE4 but that should not deter you from playing it. It had a hefty development process dating all the way back to that concept trailer shown back in 2005 and it didn't even release until March 2009. Yes, originally it was just Chris but Capcom cashed in on how easy ""co-op"" appeal is and with the whole racist backlash (That would be 10x worse in 2015, thanks tumblr) they threw in Sheva. It's still one of the best looking games of last gen even compared to RE6 although that's not much of an achievement when you look at RE6. Good music, good atmospheric design - By this I mean it's got a really nice murky urban feeling in the early levels of the game as opposed to being scary, sure it's daylight but it's Africa what do you expect? Story/Scenario is really stupid though, you're following up on things we know nothing about and we never really see most characters outside of cutscenes also for some reason despite being veterans Chris and Jill are both low ranking officers in an organization they started. Playing solo is a miserable experience having to babysit the AI and feed it your ammo and use your money to upgrade its weapons if you want it to keep up, the real experience in the game is the co-op. Having a responsive partner to use the voice commands given in the game adds to the whole co-operative nature of the game. Getting grabbed and being helped out then to quickly press a button to say ""Thanks for the help"" really makes it more satisfying that you have someone to assist you. The core gameplay itself hasn't changed too much from the series it's essentially ""RE4 with co-op"" having no typewriters anymore, no merchant what little remained of the core RE series to begin with is the tank controls. The controls themself take some getting used to and having being spoilt by RE6's masterful character control (The only good thing about the game) I had some difficulty playing it a while back but now it's out of my system I can easily manage playing it again. The post-game content is serviceable, as you go through the game you're to acquire hidden emblems that unlock content for you with the more you amass. Be they files on all creatures and people in the game, filters for the game itself, small statues that detail the models of the game or even unlockable costumes to which both Sheva and Chris have 2 each of. The game also contains the series staple Mercenaries which started in RE3 and carried over to RE4 and now RE5. The DLC content is also largely worth it having two scenarios that fill in the missing pieces of the story a lot easier granted you even care about it, two more costumes for Chris and Sheva (Well, technically only 1 each on PC since you get the other set you got on consoles PC had already) and a remixed Mercenaries mode featuring two characters from RE5 and two old returning characters from the first game in the series. With a fair amount of replay value and the likes or Mercs (provided the community is still alive) it's a game definitely worth your time even with all the flaws present the amount of time put into it is staggering compared to some of Capcom's later efforts.

Resident Evil 5, is one of my favorite games from the whole Biohazard Saga.Resident Evil 5 gameplay is fluent, easy and pretty adaptive. The enemies difficulty is very well balanced, and the chapters are about 30 minutes long.Every chapter is different from the last one, so the game won`t feel repetitive at any part. The graphics are pretty good for 2009 game, and of course is very very well optimized even for low end pc`s.All the guns are upgradable so you`ll find yourself playing the game over and over again until you upgrade your favorite ones.Resident Evil 5 is the last Resident Evil game that keeps the survival horror and action well balanced.I`d give the game a 9,5/10 Why the .5 is missing, well the DLC`s are great and the story is also amazing such as the new content it includes but the price for the DLC is bit expensive.ConclusionRECOMMENDED, worth the money even for game that`s a bit old.

												Ya know, I really like this game, despite it having no survival horror elements.  Though I also play it cooperatively, beginning to end several times.  When I played it, there was no DLC available on PC, and I was subject to the horrible Games For Windows Live.  These issues have since been fixed, so no worries there.  Still, the game is great, but Capcom is a pretty awful company that dropped the ball hard on this port initially.  Don't feel bad about passing this one up if you don't want to give them your money.			"

But this game has a really nice touch to it. The gameplay is allot better then the earlier Resident evil's, The gameplay mechanics are allot better, So almost everything to this game is an improvement. And the best thing about this game is that you can actually play this with a friend, the real co op style. i recommend this game for those who want to play a nice story (campaign game) with a friend!

												Evolution is a critical part in the existance of the world. As time goes by circumstances change and species either adapt or go extinct. Resident Evil 5 is all about evolution, both in content and in gameplay. It might not be what you want it be, but it works.Resident Evil 5 is branded as the black sheep of the Resident Evil franchise. It is the installment where everything went overboard and everything that made Resident Evil, Resident Evil was replaced with elements that made it Gears of War. Resident Evil 5 is a third person shooter at heart and not a survival horror game. This polarised many fans of the series. Even at its darkest, Resident Evil 5 isn't scary. Unsettling at best, but you're so stacked on ammo and firepower at all times that you'll be hard pressed to actually fear for your life. So, in short, you'll be gunning your way through posessed villagers, various monsters and a broad assortment of bosses; and it is very enjoyable to do so.The game drops you, Chris Redfield, Resident Evil 1 allumni, and Sheva Alomar, series newcomer and dark horse, in Africa where you're tasked to apprehend an arms dealer. Things quickly escalate when bio-weapons are involved and they're stronger and more advanced than anything seen before. The story proceeds to wrap up the ends brought forth in the earlier installments and pits you against an old enemy whose voice is arguably the sexiest baritone ever to grace the airwaves. The presentation and pace help sell the completely insane plot. If you're not an initated follower of Resident Evil  then you'll be dumbfounded. However, if you're in on the mania, than be prepared for a turbulent and explosive ride.Gameplay is fast and agressive. The combat system actively encourages to get your hands dirty. And since you're accompanied by an AI partner, or possible coop player, you'll be dishing out pain left and right. The AI's aim is to be commended. While their inventory management leaves something to be desired, the computer player knows when to shoot and it makes it count. It helps you get past some of the more frustrating moments that much easier, allowing you to get back to work asap. And you'll be doing work. The shooting from Resident Evil 4 is back, but the enemies are more resiliant and they want your fist in their face. Chris' enormous biceps are going to show their worth when you get the hang of it.Resident Evil 5 is a violent and agressive evolution of the game that Resident Evil 4 was. It isn't as revolutionary and some parts are bound to rub you the wrong way, but it is fun game to play. The viceral violence, the story and level design all add up to something really cool. Add to that some of the best action set pieces ever since they became a thing and you have a recipe for success.			"

												Having played this for 400+ plus hours on the Xbox 360 (and I'll probably be ending up with the same if not more on Steam since steamworks is almost finished) I can safely say this is one of my favourite entries in the Resident Evil franchise. Yes, it's not Resident Evil 4 but to me Resi 4 was EXTREMELY overrated. Its been released 3 times for gods sake. I didnt really enjoy 4 and  Leon is my least favourite character ever Resi 5 doesnt have the horror of the first few games but thats not a reason to not buy 5. 5 is a gem on its own. The story is cheesy but in a good way. The locations are great through out the game, always changing. The characters are fantastic although Sheva does start to get a little annoying towards the end. People often complain about how and why Chris is so beefy. I mean c'mon, he's got Albert f*cking Wesker as a nemesis! Chris got his ♥♥♥ handed to him back in Code Veronica!Anyway, all in all this game is fantastic. Its got a ton of replay value. The weapons upgrading is a neat little system that will keep you busy. There's also Mercenaries when you've finished the story and that will keep you occupied for days. And as Im writing this review, Steam achievements have just been added and they include all DLC achievements too.So when Resi 5 is moved to steamworks, you'll have even more content to play with! Lost in Nightmares is fantastic, it tells the story of when Chris and Jill went to find Ozwell E Spencer and is creepy as hell. Desperate Escape is just as good too, telling you how Josh and Jill escaped near the end.Then theres also Mercenaries Reunion and Versus mode. There is an absolute ton to do on this game. I've 100% this game at least 5 times and I'd gladly do it all over again.If you dont mind the missing element of survival horror then get this entry, for the love of god man.Thank me later.Saturation/10			"

												Unless you're going to play this game with a friend or perhaps on easy-mode singleplayer, don't get it. I played this on veteran with the AI partner and I don't remember the last time I raged this much on a singleplayer game.The forced co-op completely destroys this game if you want to play it singleplayer. Some stupid ♥♥♥♥ the AI has done:-Run towards a mob of enemies to pick up a item just to die-Constantly stand in front of me and blocks my line of sight-Uses a full heal on her own even though I am hurt as well-Doesn't help me when I'm grabbed by an enemy even though she is next to me-Full auto into the armored parts (invincible) of an enemy-Constantly fills her inventory with junk items that I don't wantI already have 30 shotgun shells so I'm not picking these up because then they require 2 inventory slots. I leave and what does the AI do? Picks them up and gives them to me! ♥♥♥♥ing hell!I booby trap a passage where strong enemies will soon spawn, what does the AI do? Picks up the ♥♥♥♥ing landmines I placed! What the ♥♥♥♥! Is this a game or some bad comedy movie!?Ok, we're on 30% health, I got a red herb, I'm going to pick up this green herb, combine them which gives full heal. TOO BAD, AI just picked up the green herb and used it.We're on a boss, there's 4 turrets we can use. What does the AI do? Uses her own weapons. I literally have to go to a turret, while the boss is attacking, and tell her to use it. And once the boss changes location, shes stays at the turret which no longer can hit the boss.And then some AI white knights say, just equip the bow or a magnum with infinite shots on her. Well, you can't do that if you haven't completed the game, ♥♥♥♥ing idiots. And I sure as hell ain't going to play it twice with the AI.SPOILERS!SPOILERS!The icing on the cake must be the end of the game. It's just a big ♥♥♥♥ you to Jill Valentine fans. Instead of it being Jill and Chris who kills Wesker it is Chris and that dumb ♥♥♥♥♥ AI Sheva, a nobody character, and then Chris has the stomach to call Sheva ""partner"" next to Jill even though Chris has contantly referred to Jill as his partner the whole game. So Chris and that dumb ♥♥♥♥♥ Sheva shoots 2 RPG into Wesker and kills him, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN JILL AND CHRIS. I've been playing Resident Evil since the original for the PS1, if anyone is going to kill Wesker it is Chris and Jill, not some dumb ♥♥♥♥♥ with terrible AI.			"

												Resident Evil 5 is a fun and frantic evolution of RE4's breakthrough gameplay and the series' horror themes.Thirteen years ago, Capcom helped revolutionize the action adventure world with Resident Evil, a game that would define an entirely new genre dubbed ""survival horror."" In the years that followed, the series continued to build upon the standards set by the first game, Then, in 2005, Resident Evil 4 radically departed from its predecessors and broke new ground as a more action-oriented game. Resident Evil 5, the latest offering in the long-running series, expands on the action-heavy formula of its forerunner and is built from the ground up to support cooperative gameplay. Though it can no longer be considered a survival horror game, Resident Evil 5 manages to retain and effectively translate the most important aspect of that genre--tension--into its new mechanics. It crafts a fun, collaborative experience that will keep you on your toes the entire time.Having two agents in the field lets you team them up to trade weapons or push dumpsters.Ten years after the destruction of Raccoon City, former S.T.A.R.S. Alpha team member Chris Redfield is an agent of the B.S.A.A. This paramilitary anti-bio-organic weapons organization travels the globe to seek out and destroy Umbrella Corporation's creations, which have fallen into the hands of terrorists following the collapse of the multinational pharmaceutical company. When Chris gets a tip that a known weapons dealer will be making a big deal in the remote African nation of Kijuju, he heads there to put a stop to it and learn what he can about the mysterious doomsday project known only as Uroboros. Chris is joined by Sheva Alomar, a local B.S.A.A. agent, and together they battle wave after wave of infected villagers, horribly mutated monsters, and even series archnemesis, Albert Wesker.The core combat mechanics haven't fundamentally changed since Resident Evil 4. The action still unfolds from an over-the-shoulder perspective, certain battles or cutscenes are accompanied by brief quick-time events, and you still have to stop moving to fire your weapon (though you gain a bit more mobility thanks to your newfound ability to walk sideways). Resident Evil 5's slow movement and gunplay take some time to get used to, and folks expecting a run-and-gun game may find the action too sluggish for their tastes. Fortunately, this slowness isn't really an issue within the game, because enemies are deliberate with their attacks and are better handled with a cool head and steady aim. Though the Xbox 360 controller is fully supported, the standard keyboard/mouse combo offers vastly superior aiming precision and control, which makes it by far the better option.Regardless of how similar the combat in Resident Evil 5 is to its predecessor, the addition of a second character makes encounters feel quite different. Teamwork is necessary to take down more powerful enemies and bosses, and having someone to watch your back goes a long way toward keeping you alive. Furthermore, there have been radical changes made to the inventory management system. The immersion-breaking briefcase from the previous game is gone, and enemies no longer politely wait for you to rummage through your things because bringing up your armory doesn't pause the action. Each character can store up to nine items, and as long as you properly organize your inventory using the simple click-and-drag interface, all of your items are only a single keystroke away, which offers an unprecedented level of accessibility to your gear. It's often necessary to trade items with your partner, and keeping track of who has what at all times is crucial, especially during boss encounters.Inventory management is easier than ever when you can click and drag items around with your mouse.Sheva's artificial intelligence makes her a competent companion, though her degree of skill seems to rely more on her armaments than anything else. She is extremely good at using burst fire with a machine gun, for example, but she tends to waste ammo when equipped with a handgun. That said, at no point does she feel like extra baggage that needs babysitting (unlike some of the series' previous companions), and she can hold her own in a fight. Sheva really shines when there's someone else controlling her. Resident Evil 5 supports online co-op play through Games for Windows Live, and exploring Kijuju with a friend greatly enhances both the experience and the fun factor. Every game has the potential to go multiplayer, since other online players can join in on a free-for-all or invite-only basis if your game session is set up to allow this from the get-go.Despite these conveniences, there are some frustrating hurdles that need to be leaped over before a partner can begin playing. Co-op isn't drop-in, so if someone joins, gameplay is interrupted and immersion is broken to some degree because the player who joined has to sit on the sidelines until the host either restarts or continues on to the next checkpoint. Another major problem is that players' main inventories are isolated from one another, and though you can trade healing items and ammunition, weapons are off-limits for exchange, making some battles more difficult if you're playing with a partner who is not as well equipped as you.That's it for today. Be sure to read the chapter on gun maintenance--you WILL be tested!Resident Evil 5 isn't a survival horror game, but that doesn't mean it hasn't learned a great deal from the genre. Tension is the central element of survival horror games, and in the past, tension has been conveyed by the gloomy settings, the sense of isolation, and the frustratingly clunky camera angles and controls. All RE5 does differently is convey this feeling through other outlets. Having a partner introduces new types of tension, because you're forced to rely on each other's support, find ways to manage both of your inventories during battles, and cover larger areas since enemies can appear from almost anywhere. Waves of enemies wax and wane with just the right frequency, and while the brightly lit environments make them less scary, they can be tough to deal with because they attack in large numbers and are smarter, faster, and stronger than their counterparts in previous games. Major encounters and boss fights are doled out with excellent pacing, and since you're never sure what to expect around the corner, you have to remain vigilant.RE5 is one of the most visually stunning games available, and its huge variety of environments is meticulously detailed in every way. There are lots of large, open areas, and you'll constantly be on the move through them since there are usually so many enemies. In-game cutscenes are top-notch (though sometimes a bit over-the-top), and Chris and Sheva are incredibly well animated, especially their faces. If you happen to have the right collection of equipment, you can also take advantage of Nvidia's 3D Vision technology to experience Resident Evil 5 in stereoscopic 3D. The dialogue is often full of the trademark goofiness found in the series. The voice acting is competent, and when paired with the excellent facial expressions, it breathes a great deal of realism into the characters. Likewise, the fantastic orchestral soundtrack heightens the gameplay with everything from the low-key, ambient tracks that play during downtimes to the frantic, upbeat songs that accompany the massive boss battles.THE GOOD Beautifully detailed graphics and character animations Having a partner enhances the fun and excitement while adding tension Real-time menu system keeps you immersed Plenty to do once you've beaten it Superior keyboard/mouse controlsTHE BAD Frustrating hurdles to leap when joining an online game Slow, deliberate movement and gunplay may not appeal to everyone Can't swap weapons with a human teammate online8.5			"

												With the removal of GFWL and the addition of being Steamwork (with all the bells and whistles of it),and the addition of the Gold edition content, the game is still a blast to play (even more so in coop).The game has been slightly downgraded in the graphics, but not by much. The only thing noticable (to me) is that the awesome light effects of the Live version are absent.And suprisingly it still stands out, for a 2009 game, which is great.If your PC could run it before than it should still be able to run it today.Only downside is the questionable coop AI behavior.8/10			"

												If you know me well, I absolutely HATE replaying games over and over again, but this game... I have played over and over, I know most of what happens but when I go back to replay it, it feels brand new to me. Possibly the BEST coop game created, it is perfectly styled and executed with coop in mind, obviously there are drawbacks as the story isn't too long but is long enough and interesting enough to keep you thinking and wondering what will happen. The only big complaint I have is that it starts out as a horror, but ends up being a big action game, which isn't bad but its just my personal opinion.

												While I am no dedicated fan of the Resident Evil series, nor an everyday follower, I hear many cite Resident Evil 5 as the beginning of what they felt was a decline. Having only foggy childhood memories of Resident Evil 2 on my old Nintendo 64 and a close friend's dedication to the series holding me back, I can still say I understand why.It is no secret that I am one for action games with good tempo and flow; the countless hours I've invested into Payday, E.Y.E., and Killing Floor speak volumes. I am no stranger to horror; I've played the far ends of the spectrum in Amnesia and Penumbra, Dead Space and STALKER. Even as restrained as I can be, I can say wholeheartedly that Resident Evil 5 struck none of the high notes that any of those titles - for all the hours and playthroughs they've offered me - have achieved.While undoubtedly far in advance of the fixed camera perspective I recall from Resident Evil 2, Resident Evil 5's combat hit me as clunky, backwards, and bizarrely slow. Clunky, where the player is rooted to the ground while firing and is most often required to use slow-firing manual and semiautomatic weapons. Backwards, where headshots are passively discouraged by the early introduction of particular reactions to headshots. Bizarrely slow, where mentioned focus on pistols and pump-action shotguns combines with a dawdling enemy pace that would make some of my slowest games in strategy titles seem like they were taking place at superluminal velocity.Storywise, I doubt I have ever cringed as much as I have through the course of watching Resident Evil 5's plot. It is easily the most unashamedly cheesy and melodramatic game I have ever played, bereft of humor and serious to a fault. In some cases, I saw plot elements coming from miles away. In others, I could feel the word ""why"" trying to beat its way out of my skull. Particularly, a character is introduced early on with all the subtlety and rationality in design as a tank skydiving into a ballpit. As the plot continued to thicken, I could feel my ""immersion"" - had I even pretended to carry any - shrivel further and further.Bogging down gameplay and storytelling yet more are the absurdly numerous and absurdly lengthy quick-time events that sometimes boggled the mind as to why they even existed. Events such as the player characters running down hallways became, at some points, interactive cutscenes, rather than allowing player control and offering meaningful challenges over button mashing contests and keyboard (or controller) attention checks. While I do not deny that Dead Space - oft-compared and of similar genre definition - featured many of its own quick-time events, I feel much more confident in their role and value than I do Resident Evil 5's.The game is not without its strengths, of course - I don't deal in absolutes. Balance, both in supply hurdles and enemies, is well laid-out. Graphical quality is astonishing for an early 2009 game. Voice acting, though given material I find questionable to follow, is done well. High marks are also to be given for its stability, though it should be known that I and a close friend encountered a gamebreaking, though eventually resolved bug at the very end of the game. Multiplayer features offer some replayability, but unfortunately play to one of the game's weak suits - its combat - outside of regular cooperative play.In conclusion, however, these strengths did little to sway me. I found little to enjoy in the game besides my closest friend's company and my opportunity to grant her the happiness of continuing one of her favorite game series. While others may disagree with my opinions, I can say honestly that the game offered little to my tastes but a basic marksmanship course.			"

												Resident Evil 4 massively broke the formula. Whilst there were some complaints from the diehards, the overwhelming census was that the franchise's break away from fixed camera was for the best. Whilst their recent titles Code Veronica and Resident Evil 0 were decent enough, but not amazing, RE4 found audiences every bit as awe struck by the game as they were when they first stepped foot in Spenser Manor in 1996. The franchise looked onward to a bright new future that whilst certainly would leave its survival horror roots behind, would immerse it's audience in a detailed 3D world with tight new gunplay as they fought back overwhelming hordes of Mexicans Spaniards.Alas, the dream was too good to be true. RE5 was merely a mediocre third person shooter with nothing more than an arbitrary RE universe story featuring some familiar faces. The fantastic difficulty balance and pacing of the battles seen in its predecessor  were absent, and the distinctly Japanese over the top story and set pieces were replaced with Western feeling low key blandness. Whilst some areas such as the swampy island area offered enjoyable large scale battles, much of the game was spent trudging down corridors spraying a continual stream of bullets.The biggest upside to this title is that coop mode plays very well, and overcoming a difficult spot with teamwork on the harder difficulties feels very rewarding. Also, it means you won't have to put up with the immersion breaking ai ineptitude of Sheva.Spear-chucking Mud Men out of Ten***Fun Stuff for RE Fans***Check out where the series really got it's root's from by playing Sweet Home on the NES (or at least an English rom on an emulator...). It's a survival horror RPG in which a team of characters explore a haunted mansion (which is refereed to as a 'House of Residing Evil'!). You have limited inventory space, one character has a permanent lock pick, one has a permanent lighter, and the only way to heal if to carry the limited number of inventory hogging healing items you find. Also, doors open slowly in first person. Any of that sound familiar to veterans of the series? Its a far better, and far scarier experience than RE5!			"

												Resident Evil 5 carries on what Resident Evil 4 brilliantly reinvented. Survival Horror with a more action focused twist. This time the story takes place in Africa following Resident Evil newcomer, Chris Redfield and newbie, Sheva Alomar, as they intercept a black market bioweapon deal. What follows is the situation going from bad to worse as they encounter series antagonist Albert Wesker. Where Resident Evil 5 differs from the previous games in the series is it's use of co-op.  You could play the game by yourself and rely on the AI partner, but that's more terrifying than anything you'll find in this game. The AI will recklessly use health and ammo without a care in the world leaving you in serious trouble when it comes down to a tough encounter with a pack of enemies. Where it shines is if you play it with a friend, Resident Evil 5 is probably one of the best co-op games out there with a challenging, and reasonably sized campaign which will see you and your friend constantly communicating and relying on each other to get over difficult challenges. Even though the game came out in 2009, the graphics still hold up well today and the game's soundtrack is what you'd expect of a Resident Evil title. You've got your typical ""creepy lab"" track, but you also have tracks that fit the African setting. The game also comes with Mercenaries mode, where you (and a partner) have to kill as many enemies to gain points in a time limit, but it's probably one of the weaker parts of the game and not really worth spending much time on. Resident Evil 6's mercenaries mode is a lot better. Summing up, if you have a friend to play Resident Evil 5 with, then you can't ask for a better experience, especially if you play it on one of the harder difficulties. Playing by yourself is frustrating and not a lot of fun, so perhaps you should try Resident Evil 4 if you're by yourself.			"

												Let me put this shortly:It's a bad Resident Evil game. But it's a fantastic Co-op action game!If you're playing this for the scares, there are other games that do scares alot better, you will probably be disappointed. If you are thinking about purchasing this, i highly recommend playing this with a friend. As a solo experience its an OKAY game, the AI is kinda dumb from time to time, so be warned if you are going in solo. It's just TON more fun with a friend as your back up.Things I dislike:- As mentioned above, the sometimes dumb AI- Controls. They take a little to get used to, at first they felt really wonky. One thing ive not been able to get over tho is    that you cannot move when using your knife/melee weapon. (I recommend controller over mouse and keyboard)-  Atleast when i played, there weren't that many people online to randomly play with. The game is old afterall- Its not a good Resident Evil game, not so mcuh survival horror. Some, but not much.Things I like:- Amazing Co-op action expirience.- Awesome unlockables that keep you playing the game more and more just to unlock them all. Costumes, weapons, infinite ammo for those weapons, filters that change how the game looks.- Managing your ammo and items between yourself and your friend.- Overall fun expirience (again, amazing with a friend)I do think though that the price should be lowered. The game is pretty old afterall. If you are going to get the game, get the GOLD VERSION from a steam sale.			"

												The best worst game you'll ever play, it's complete drivel but if you play with a mate, then it's comedic gold with pretty decent combat to boot that you lets you spend a few evenings twatting about doing awful Albert Wesker impressions. If it's on sale for £5 spend £10 and get a copy for a mate otherwise it's a waste of money.			"

												Resident Evil 5 – качественный боевик с очень яркими и кинематографичными эффектами. Мы управляем Крисом от третьего лица. Игра целиком заточена под кооператив, её нужно проходить вдвоем. За несколько часов происходят десятки ситуаций: побег на «Хаммере» от зомби-мотоциклистов, пулеметный расстрел гигантского тролля, у которого из головы периодически вылезает какой-то сгусток биомассы, сожжение черного комка щупалец в специальной камере, исполинская летучая мышь, скребущая лапами по огромному грузовику, который летит вместе с ней в пропасть. Здесь есть относительная свобода – можно пролезать в окна, спрыгивать с крыш, вламываться в двери и обходить все это десятой дорогой. Камера так же висит за плечом, а оружия всякого стало еще больше. Можно спокойно и уверенно двигаться по локации, патроны не в дефиците – они выпадают прямо из убитых врагов. Моя оценка 10/10.			"

												This is the best game ever. I mean, it's not a Resident Evil game. I don't really know what kind of game you could call it even -- because other than injecting names and faces, it plays and looks nothing like typical RE games. I'm not telling you this because it's a minus rather it is a plus. This game is enjoyable on two levels.The Savannah chapter is the worst. I wish there was a mod to remove that chapter entirely because then this game would be flawless.I have memorized every map, I know how to obtain every emblem and I get lady-hard when people want to co-op this game with me because it's my zen.

												In its attempt to turn the series into a cinematic direction following Resident Evil 4 and refreshing its gameplay with the introduction of co-op mechanics, Resident Evil 5 lost its horror feel along the way. If you play it with a friend, however, you're in for a lot of fun. The story of the game is rather simple and is presented with a slightly over-the-top direction giving it a stronger action movie feel. The graphics are sharp and detailed, an example of superb texture work and optimisations, despite the game's palette being somewhat monotonous. The gameplay turned from being scary into being fun, especially with a friend, and its variety keeps the game from becoming boring. Collectibles, various difficulty modes, unlockables, bonuses and extras add to its replayability.If you're a horror fan looking for new thrills, look elsewhere. But if it's the cinematic zombie-slaying entertainment you're after, you will surely find it in this game.			"

												Finally game was moved to Steamworks. I've dreamed about it since I bought this game. On Game for Windows Live I couldn't even log in so I had to create offline profile to save progress in game and I could play co-op only by LAN. Now on Steamworks all was repaired. It is one of the best cooperative shooter that I ever played. It is not survival horror but sometimes game could scare. You do not need quad core CPU to run this game. Game works fine even on dual-core CPU. Game doesn't work for Windows XP anymore, you need to run this game on Windows 7 (if you have less than 4 GB RAM install 32-bit version, performance will be better). If you like cooperative shooters I highly recommend this game.			"

												What would be considered a truly innovative and immersive evolution in the Resident Evil universe by some, an abomination by others, Resident Evil 5 is what you make of it.  I was one of the die-hards from the old school series that initially frowned upon this new ""advancement"" in the series, but what I looked down my nose at back in 2009, I can now reminisce upon with affection.  Sure it may not be a true traditional survival horror game, but let's take a look at what it did right.  We are re-united with franchise favorite Chris Redfield, bringing in the old-school fans, and we are introduced to Sheva, who is actually portrayed as a strong woman with character and proves to be a solid partner.  We have a new co-op dynamic that we had never seen before in this form, making it honestly approachable to fresh blood, bringing new fans to the series.  With a solid storyline and an impressive amount of collectibles to find, upgrades to weapons and armor, and the classic ""Mercenaries"" mode you'll find an overall enjoyable experience.  I personally still find the game visually beautiful, the voice acting solid, and the controls are ace.  It's not something we initially accepted as a great game, but looking back and re-playing it brings me an immense amount of happiness.  Sure, Excellea was an awful character, the portrayal of Jill was pretty terrible, the demise of one of my favorite characters was the worst...but I still smile when I play.  And I think at its core it has its heart in the right place, and that's what's important.			"

												I first tried to play this game by myself back in 2009. What did I think about it? I thought it sucked, but i got this strange feeling that somehow I should have liked it, but I didn't.This summer I and a friend needed a game to play, and for some reason this I thought of this game. We both bought it, and let me tell you; when this game is at it's best, it's a FANTASTIC co-op experience. At it's worst it's not good at all, what comes to mind is the horrible QTEs and other scripted events. At least three out of the otherwise fine bosses, relies too heavily on these design choices and probably shouldn't have been there at all.You get a nice feeling of accomplishment and the ""I'm there for you buddy""-feeling that makes a great co-op game. This is probably most true for the hardest difficulty, which we played the game in. The drawbacks on this difficulty are the aforementioned bosses, QTEs and scripted events that becomes an annoyance, and if you're unlucky you can get stuck on them and  they take a horrible amount of time. If you have the time, and can forgive the game for these moments, you will have great fun. If you don't want these annoyances, you probably should lower the difficulty a bit, but then you will have a more casual experience. Conclusion:  If you want RE4 all over again, you might be disappointed, although I think it's somewhat true to the core mechanics. Nevertheless, it's a DAMN GOOD CO-OP experience. If you got a buddy to play with an hour or two a day, give this one a shot, especially on a sale. If  instead you're a poor lonely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I say do not even think about getting it (AI Sheva can suck it)			"

This series has always verged on camp, but here Capcom really takes the ridiculousness to a new level. Chris Redfield now punches boulders and careens over lava with superhuman ease. The dialogue sends me into fits of laughter. And the boss fights are fantastic fun. Sure, it's hardly a survival horror at this point, but to me the original games were never really all that scary to begin with (they ain't Silent Hill, that's for sure). If you weren't expect another coming of RE4, RE5 does its job well. 8/10			"

												I first tried to play this game by myself back in 2009. What did I think about it? I thought it sucked, but i got this strange feeling that somehow I should have liked it, but I didn't.This summer I and a friend needed a game to play, and for some reason this I thought of this game. We both bought it, and let me tell you; when this game is at it's best, it's a FANTASTIC co-op experience. At it's worst it's not good at all, what comes to mind is the horrible QTEs and other scripted events. At least three out of the otherwise fine bosses, relies too heavily on these design choices and probably shouldn't have been there at all.You get a nice feeling of accomplishment and the ""I'm there for you buddy""-feeling that makes a great co-op game. This is probably most true for the hardest difficulty, which we played the game in. The drawbacks on this difficulty are the aforementioned bosses, QTEs and scripted events that becomes an annoyance, and if you're unlucky you can get stuck on them and  they take a horrible amount of time. If you have the time, and can forgive the game for these moments, you will have great fun. If you don't want these annoyances, you probably should lower the difficulty a bit, but then you will have a more casual experience. Conclusion:  If you want RE4 all over again, you might be disappointed, although I think it's somewhat true to the core mechanics. Nevertheless, it's a DAMN GOOD CO-OP experience. If you got a buddy to play with an hour or two a day, give this one a shot, especially on a sale. If  instead you're a poor lonely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I say do not even think about getting it (AI Sheva can suck it)			"

												I didn't play Resident Evil 5 much at the moment the game came out, although I've bought it and then somehow lost it. Recently I've bought Resident Evil 6 to play with and was more than pleased with the game mechanics, cutscenes, voice acting and more action-orentied gameplay (with both tight and fluid keyboard and mouse controls) than classic chapters of Resident Evil. I played all the classic chapters on PC and PSX and always loved the franchise, either it was a horror-survival or action-survival game. After beating Resident Evil 6, getting all the achievements, all skills and all of other stuff, I wanted to try the preceding chapter, so I bought Resident Evil 5 second time, now both the main game and the gold edition add-on to have this game with Steamworks support. Turned out that the game is actually better than sequel and more fun too, I've beaten the game on all four difficulties with S-rank, I bought and upgraded almost all weapons, now heading to get all those achivements. Back to the game - the camera is under your full control, no annoying ""director"" in your way like in RE6, way less QTE moments but they look awkward on keyboard. You cannot walk while shoot (remember - I've already played Dead Space and Resident Evil 6 at this moment) but the devs were taking it into account so it works really well. The only drawback is your AI partner, which can be pretty annoying on Professional difficulty - you'll be hearing ""Shevaaa!"" a lot as she will die from the sunbeam in 4th chapter most of the time. Damn, it pisses me off, believe me. Oh, and it consumes my ammo - shame on you, Capcom, it's mine - get your dirty hands off it! And QTE moments - while RE6 has a ton of it, they feels ok - good luck becaming a pro in pressing F+V in RE5. All of this cons were addressed and corrected in RE6 but still RE5 is better game almost in any way. Maybe the multiplayer section and the mercenaries is better in RE6. The major difference is that the RE5 is more a game rather than ""playable movie"" style of RE6. I suggest you to buy both games and play RE6 first. The game is more than good. It's not the best way to follow the games' storylines but I played this way and after completing both games it doesn't really matter which one came first. And then play RE5, which is awesome. If you tend to play with the gamepad I suggest you to play Resident Evil 4 which is also a very good game and, as they say, better than both RE5 and RE6, but suffering from bad keyboard and mouse controls support, even in HD re-release, and I don't possess the Xbox controller. Yet. Oh, and I hate to save on typewriters, don't know why though, as it doesn't require the precious ink ribbon in RE4.			"

												Great game! I was confused initially because of the live windows but then I saw that it was only for those who wanted to migrate data saved to the steam. I lost time creating an account but it was not necessary for me. I wanted to play from the beginning. The game is superior to last capcom releases as revelations 1/2 and RE6. The quality of play in the graphic aspect, sound and music are infinitely superior to those already mentioned above. The gameplay is a little lower than the resident evil revelations but far outweighs the other counts as history, atmosphere, graphics and sounds. The sound of guns the resident evil revelations are sounds just generic and the sound of the resident evil 5 shots are something spectacular! The games that came after RE5 suffered real ""downgrades"". Resident evil 5 in my opinion is the best in the series. The campaign mode has high replay value while the others do not have it.			"

												This game is so much fun!!!Lets get started then, first Campaign.The campaign is pretty good considering that its not a true Resi game. I enjoyed the campaign so much im playing it again. Yes the AI for Sheva may be clumsy from time to time so you may be better off playing with a friend. There is also collectable emblems which unlocks costumes for Chris and Sheva.Bonus Modes.There isn't that many bonus modes added in Resident Evil 5 but the mercenaries mode is enjoyable. They have also added a No Mercy mode just for PC. There is plenty of maps to play on the mercenaries mode and it is replayable as you can feel like you can get a much better score than your previous score. In the story mode you start off with 3 difficulties. Once you complete veteren mode you unlock professional mode which just seems darn impossible.Verdict.Resident Evil 5 may not be like the other Resident Evil game but it is a fun one. Mainly built for co-op its still fun when you play solo. The game does have a few issues with Enemys and Shevas AI from time to time but its still worth checking out. (My score 8.5/10)			"

												This is the point where RE franchise start to go downhill. Instead on horror the game is heavy action oriented. Enemies are more annoying then scary. If you play solo, inventory system is pain in the ♥♥♥ and your partner is useless most of the time just waisting ammo. Story is average and gameplay is shoulder view like in RE4. Unlike in RE4 the atmosphere is gone and there are no moody enviroments, enemies are forgetable and sometimes very annoying. This game should have been a lesson to Capcom to not create something similar ever again. Its still fun game if you have friend to play online or offline co op. There are a lot of extras to keep you playing even when you finish the game. So I would recommend if you have a friend to play with.			"

												In its attempt to turn the series into a cinematic direction following Resident Evil 4 and refreshing its gameplay with the introduction of co-op mechanics, Resident Evil 5 lost its horror feel along the way. If you play it with a friend, however, you're in for a lot of fun. The story of the game is rather simple and is presented with a slightly over-the-top direction giving it a stronger action movie feel. The graphics are sharp and detailed, an example of superb texture work and optimisations, despite the game's palette being somewhat monotonous. The gameplay turned from being scary into being fun, especially with a friend, and its variety keeps the game from becoming boring. Collectibles, various difficulty modes, unlockables, bonuses and extras add to its replayability.If you're a horror fan looking for new thrills, look elsewhere. But if it's the cinematic zombie-slaying entertainment you're after, you will surely find it in this game.			"

												Great game! This is the second platform I've played RE5 on, the other was XBOX 360 and Steam runs it perfectly on my old laptop. Smooth and no lagging.Only downside is that the AI is pretty rubbish. Not feeling the fact that I'm constantly being shot in the back and zapped by a stun rod from my partner.			"

												Chris Redfield contains his genitals as he looks for the cure to aids inside the deepest darkest depths in AfricaWhile retaining most of the gameplay that made Resident Evil 4 a masterpiece, the single player game is virtually un-playable. Not only do you have to keep up with your a.i. partner (which has atrocious ai btw), you also have to manage their inventory for them. The game is pretty boring at the start, gets a bit better towards the middle, then falls flat again at towards the end.If anything, the co-op is actually pretty good. if you've got a friend, then this game may be a fun night of blasting ♥♥♥♥. However, if you are flying solo, I don't recommend it at all. The single-player is just so clunky and unpolished that it isn't worth the struggle.			"

												Resident Evil 5 had a rough start. The media bashed the game before it even saw the light of day for It's racism towards the African people that the trailers showed. Once the game came out, you heard no more complaints about racisim. What you had, was another pretty good Resident Evil game. The story is your standard Resident Evil tale, Wesker is up to no good and its up to (Chris) and his new partner (Sheva) to stop him. The combat can be exciting tho still feels trapped in the past, Not being able to walk and shoot is a small complaint, but Dead Space has showed us how important it is and it just makes sence. Now with a friend this game can be pretty amazing at time, tho playing solo, it feels like the AI is holding you back and is only good for using as a second inventory.If you have a friend to play this with and can get passed some of the old trappings this series still faces, you'll be in for a fun time.Personal Rating: 4/5 "

												Great game! I was confused initially because of the live windows but then I saw that it was only for those who wanted to migrate data saved to the steam. I lost time creating an account but it was not necessary for me. I wanted to play from the beginning. The game is superior to last capcom releases as revelations 1/2 and RE6. The quality of play in the graphic aspect, sound and music are infinitely superior to those already mentioned above. The gameplay is a little lower than the resident evil revelations but far outweighs the other counts as history, atmosphere, graphics and sounds. The sound of guns the resident evil revelations are sounds just generic and the sound of the resident evil 5 shots are something spectacular! The games that came after RE5 suffered real ""downgrades"". Resident evil 5 in my opinion is the best in the series. The campaign mode has high replay value while the others do not have it.			"

												What and how can you best describe resident evil 5 without encouraging the wrath of fans and or putting off new comers to series.I could tell you its obvious continual flaws but why bother when its equally as obvious this is how its developers intended it to be. Location, location, location is my personal demon as the setting of 5 or for me anyway removed any element of horror that both its previous and their after titles install. RE5 which i imagine as a result of RE4 has moved away from the horror survival to one of an action game which isnt worth the trade especially when you consider RE4 had both.Do i recommend this game, yeh. Do i recommend this game over other titles in the series, absolutely not but when all is said and done its all a continuing story so is worth adding to the collection if RE is your thing and you intend to invest more into it.

												So I played this game for countless hours on the PS3 when it was released, and it was probably one of the best games I have ever played. Is the PC version different from console version? Well there are only two things worth mentioning. Instead of the classic laser for aiming you are given a crosshair, this isn't really a big deal once you get used to it. Another thing is that the controls are a little clonky on the PC, but after about 2 hours of getting used to them, they won't bother you at all. Awesome game! It was great to relive all the cool moments this game had!			"

												Quick rundown: Resident Evil 5 continues the evolution of the Resident Evil series into more action than horror. If you’ve played Resident Evil 4 and wanted better controls, better graphics, and more gunfire, you’ll enjoy RE 5. They’ve also refined the combat system so you don’t spend as much time knifing people lying on the ground because ammo is a lot less of a problem this time around (overall). You still run out of ammo in the middle of some missions, but you can quit and reload, getting access to your stash. Note that RE 5 is the kind of game you where you can keep load and replay specific chapters to grind for money and ammo. If you have a co-op partner the game is much more fun since the entire campaign can be played with a friend (or a stranger). Games for Windows Live has been stripped out of the Steam version by the way, but it’s not perfectly done.The game’s story follows Chris Redfield as he battles his way through various hostile environments in Africa with his new partner Sheva. Chris is an officer in the BSAA, investigating the apparent use of bioweapons in the area, and by bioweapon I don’t mean Ebola or Super Aids. Ouroboros is a world ending super virus aimed at culling the “inferior” humans from the planet (by adding their biomass to giant monsters). Most of Chris’ enemies seems to be infected with the Las Plagas parasite that Leon Kennedy encountered in Resident Evil 4, turning people into slow moving “rage zombies” that follow the orders of mysterious bad guys. That’s not all though since the virus can also cause grotesque mutations, and advanced versions can create monstrous giant bosses. If you’ve watched the Resident Evil movie series or played the previous games, you’ll recognize the big boss of Resident Evil 5, and even some of the fight scenes seem to have been ripped off for the movies.Like Resident Evil 4, this game is played in third person but unlike part 4, Resident Evil 5 was built with 2-player co-op in mind.  Throughout the campaign, you play either Chris or Sheva, and the computer AI (or a friend) controls the other character. Sheva is unlocked for single player after beating the game but can be played immediately in co-op. You’ll be fighting side by side 95% of the time but occasionally split up in scripted areas. During these short periods, you’ll be much more vulnerable because not only do you not have a partner covering your back, you also don’t have anyone to revive you if you take too much damage and go down. As I mentioned earlier you get a lot more ammunition in this game than in RE 4, which means you’ll be shooting a lot more as well. Be warned that your computer controlled partner fires their weapons a lot, possibly eating up all your ammo. Both characters have their own 9 slot inventory and can freely swap items between them. Between levels, you have the opportunity to modify your inventory by moving things into a persistent “stash” that can hold infinite items. This way, you can always start a level with what you need and don’t have to sell off your stuff to make room like in RE 4. In RE 4 your inventory was just too small to hold all the guns and ammo. I also mentioned before that you can replay levels at will, which means if you know there’s lots of ammo or money in a certain level you can farm it over and over. By the end you should have more ammo than you will ever need, but money (for upgrading guns) will always be in short supply. Pros:+Great game for co-op if you have a friend that you want to play through the campaign with. The game allows you to save your inventory separately when you quit a level. This means if you realize you’ve wasted too much ammo and want to quit without saving, you can. This also means you can start a level, grab all the goodies in the starting area, and save + quit.+Faster paced than Resident Evil 4. I enjoy action games, and RE 5 plays a lot more like Dead Space, where you need to constantly be on your guard against getting mobbed. Aiming, reaction speed, and choosing your next move in the thick of combat (take advantage of invincibility animations!) are all important skills.+Excellent graphics (horrible monsters) and a decent storyline. You also get the Mercenaries mini game unlocked after beating the campaign. You can spend a lot of time on this game mode.Cons:-You will need to replay some levels to get the money/ammo necessary to advance in the game. I didn’t mind because I like farming for items, but some people may not appreciate that you HAVE TO replay levels during your first playthrough. It takes about 15 hours to beat the game because of all the replay, even though actually running through each level would probably end the game in about 5 hours.-The game was formerly tied to Games for Windows Live, and even though that requirement has been stripped out of the Steam version, it still tries to launch GFWL on startup of the game. Steam gives you a product key to enter for GFWL, except the GFWL doesn’t exist. There’s also a little DOS window that says something about module not found every time I play the game. This is just a minor annoyance, but it seems like something they ought to have fixed.-Alas, a lot of the game’s Steam achievements are tied to the DLC Untold Stories, which costs almost as much as the base game. Overall, the game is a lot of fun, and if you get into it you can spend 25 hours easily just unlocking all the weapons, and even more playing the Mercenaries mode. You’ll enjoy the experience a lot more with a co-op partner than by yourself.  "

												I recommend this game buuuut there's a few problems you should know before buying this. Compared to other versions of RE5 this game does lack some features: -No split screen. Even the PS3/360 ver has split screen, as does the newer PS4/XB1 versions-No Mercy Mercenaries mode is single player ONLY      (No Mercy being a previously exclusive PC mode where you'd play mercenaries mode but with the enemy count cranked WAY up) -VERY narrow field of view. There's a mod to fix this you can find online but I'm not sure it works with both characters, you MAY have to have one or the other installed. This is only made more glaring when I found the PS4/XB1 version has a extra option to widen the field of view.Positives: +It's really well optimized, has a benchmark tool to test out your system as well. +Supports 144hz/unlockable framerate+Removed Games for Windows Live!!+ Finally has the DLC featuring a lot of stuff.RE5 is a damn fun game, if you're playing CO-OP. I've never played single player but I've heard stories of wonky AI. That aside though if you have a friend to play with this game is one of the best co-op games I've played. It's not just shoot all the enemies, you actually have to manage inventory between you and a friend as you're trying to survive which makes for more hectic gameplay. It's a pretty long game and has a LOT of crap to do. The campaign mode with different difficulty modes, a load of weapons and items to change up the game. Mercenaries mode where you have a ton of levels and characters to play as making every session different. This isn't the best version but it works well enough and with Games for Windows Live removed there's no more BS keeping you from playing with a friend.			"

												Resident evil 5 it's the climax of the series when it comes to environment quality, gameplay, cinematics and animations, weapon selection and upgrades.The gameplay is dynamic and compared to the newer games from the series, never gets boring, combined with a nice selection of guns and satisfying weapon upgrade system, Resident Evil 5 is definetly the most replayable game in the franchise, requiring up to 5 story playthroughs to fully complete your arsenal. Environment textures are nothing special just decent, but the athmosphere is very good overall! Characters are highly detailed when it comes to textures, wearing items, animations and even the sounds they make (footsteps, breathing, gun handling).One of the most remarkable features of this game are the very high quality cinematics, way above any other RE game from the beginning to 2013.When it comes to story, it has good and bad parts, but not the story is what made this game great. The co-op feature is  well made, also mercenaries mode is fun both with or without a co-op partner.Unfortunately, so far Resident Evil 5 is the last game in the series worth buying, the 2 newer games being a huge letdown in my opinion.

( I have heard this is a game feature though )But my problem with it.The metal gate the guard key is supposed to work on....(in order to continue)......didn't.Oh, I also hate trying to melee in this game.

												I recommend this game buuuut there's a few problems you should know before buying this. Compared to other versions of RE5 this game does lack some features: -No split screen. Even the PS3/360 ver has split screen, as does the newer PS4/XB1 versions-No Mercy Mercenaries mode is single player ONLY      (No Mercy being a previously exclusive PC mode where you'd play mercenaries mode but with the enemy count cranked WAY up) -VERY narrow field of view. There's a mod to fix this you can find online but I'm not sure it works with both characters, you MAY have to have one or the other installed. This is only made more glaring when I found the PS4/XB1 version has a extra option to widen the field of view.Positives: +It's really well optimized, has a benchmark tool to test out your system as well. +Supports 144hz/unlockable framerate+Removed Games for Windows Live!!+ Finally has the DLC featuring a lot of stuff.RE5 is a damn fun game, if you're playing CO-OP. I've never played single player but I've heard stories of wonky AI. That aside though if you have a friend to play with this game is one of the best co-op games I've played. It's not just shoot all the enemies, you actually have to manage inventory between you and a friend as you're trying to survive which makes for more hectic gameplay. It's a pretty long game and has a LOT of crap to do. The campaign mode with different difficulty modes, a load of weapons and items to change up the game. Mercenaries mode where you have a ton of levels and characters to play as making every session different. This isn't the best version but it works well enough and with Games for Windows Live removed there's no more BS keeping you from playing with a friend.			"

												Aaaaah Resident Evil 5, how many years did we spend together? You were my lover since 2009 from PS3 especially thanks to your side modes.... you were one of the worst resident evil games in terms of story but you you do really entertained me.If you think i'm crazy guys then you're right but Resident Evil 5 is the classic game that you may love and hate at the same time.Let's do things in order and let me explain.If you expect to find a Resident Evil with the right of having this name then just look somewhere else. We have no more the classic survival horror structure here. It has been replaced with a coop action style game that totally kills the essence of what RE always was.The story itself is plain, not that bad for sure but totally far from the strong impact that the classic games had back in the day, however it offers replayability and entertains you as long as you enjoy running around shooting, melting and kicking the butt of your foes. The game is pretty challenging as well so is surely worth the try.If you play this episode you need to forget what Resident Evil was and look at this product, as i said, just as a funny shooter.The mechanics are interesting and casual gamers would surely enjoy this game.Anyway, what makes this game a very tasty cherry pie are the side modes: 5 alternatives to the main game that will give you even more chances to keep playing. My favourite was ""Versus"" mode, where 4 different players are called to arms to fight eachother in 4 different ways (Is up to the host to choose which one).This mode Versus had strong impact over the community and i managed to find myself thrown inside a lake of salt and drama queens that marked Re5 Versus as the main reason to buy a copy of this episode.Today the community has been strongly nerfed due to the years that this game has on its shoulder and even if after 5 years of 24/7 play times i reached the burn out i still miss those moments. Sometimes i try to play it again but i totally lack the will and the skills i got have gone so it pisses me off even more.I hope whoever buys this game joins the community and tries to bring a new life to it, Versus really deserves it and i hope that Capcom fixes the netcode of the game cause it has some serious crashing issues when trying to play online, sometimes you get disconnected randomly.One last thing, you will surely fall in love with: ""IT WAS IN YOUR BEST INTEREST TO ASSIST ME"". You will see what i mean when you play the game :P "

												I bought this game during the Capcom sale, at the time I was thinking ""Hey this will be fun for a few hours"" little did I know I would be sucked into this spectacular game. I know it's not a very good horror game due to co-op but the gameplay makes up for those flaws. Grab a friend and buy this game because it will give you countless hours of fun.8/10P.S. Buy this game during a sale so if you don't like it you wont feel too bad for spending only five dollars.			"

												10/10Pros and Cons+  Everthing is greatexcept-   After three/four playthrow the sound of Sheva start to get extremely annoying.-   The Al sometimes sucks when playing on professional mode ( hardest difficulty ).This game continues five years after Resident Evil 4,and if you haven’t played the previous game. You will understand by the flashbacks that Chris Redfield had another partner, Jill Valentine and she died with Albert Wesker (the big bad villain) that's what he thought at least.After learning about Jill may still be alive, Chris and Sheva (his new partner) sets out to find the truth. That's what basically what the whole game is about and stopping Wesker from destroying the world.			"

												A great game that allows people to coop both story mode and the mercenaries giving players plenty of hours of enjoyment. What i really enjoyed with this game is being able to use multiple weapons and keeping them so i can upgrade and eventually use unlimited ammo with them, which is completly optional; Resident Evil 5 has its faults too starting with the number of items avaliable to use is much smaller than the briefcase mechanic used in Resident Evil 4, but the trade off here is Resident Evil 5 allows players to keep their weapons outside of missions while Resident Evil 4's is dependent on the amount of space the player's breifcase has. The only bad mechanics i found with this game is needing to mod the game for online versus, mercenaries, team surival etc. because the aiming is off, needing to mod for the laser sights for story mode because the laser sights is only avaiable if playing with a controller, and bugs like map clipping and sequences not working properly. If you can overlook those small caviots then i would recommend this game and strongly recommend cooping with another player.			"

												Originally owned this on PS3 and played / completed it there on single player.Have since bought this on Steam and have nearly played it all through in Co-Op mode.This game is meant to be played in Co-op mode as it makes it a lot more fun as in single player the AI can be a little slow on the uptake or get cornered/into difficulty (especially on boss fights)I use a controller set-up and find it very straightford and damiliar to use.The graphics are still good for its age and the story isn't too bad. I think there is good replay value as you can do each chapter individually if chasing certain rankings and rewards.The inventory is easy to manage and the upgrades for each weapon good.Overall a great follow up game to RE4 and worth owning for any true Resident Evil fan.

												This game is likely one of my guilty pleasures. I know people tend to hate the 'new' Resident Evils, but I happen to really like them.Prior to playing it on PC, I played it at least a 100 hours on Xbox, going through everything to get a 100% complete rating and all the achievments. Sadly, the appeal of those things are.. well.. gone, with this version.Sure, it was a fun run through but the lack of friends actually owning this port left me playing by myself. Which is good, but not nearly as fun as with someone else. That, and this version lacks the DLC all together. Two missions with new characters, new outfits, new challenges, and new filters, are all gone, the menu they used to be in still actually present in the game like it should've been there.To keep it short, I recommend you get it for cheap with a friend and play it through; it's still a great game despite allk the hate.[Update] I wrote this review several months ago, and as of that point, the DLC has become available. I don't recommend buying it for the price it's at as it is an old DLC set for full price for a game no one really liked, but if it ever goes on sale along with the game, it's worth a playthrough for sure.

												Finally decided to do a RE marathon since I had never really finished any of them. This one blew me away! I played it on a projector on the giant screen with 3D using Tridef software  (the default NVidia 3D was flat and very blah). Pretty good 3D and the graphics were amazing even by today's standards. The storyline wasn't too bad either. I like how they bring back characters and develop the story further. Difficulty level was fair as I don't play these to prove to myself I can beat it on ""insane"" or whatever modes are above normal. I kept trying to play it closer to its release date but just kept getting distracted. I'm sure glad I waited this long because I was able to play it on a proper setup, given how incredible it looked on the big screen. Excellent game and I had no glitches aside from having to switch over to the DS4 as the Steam and this game didn't seem to like each other.			"

												This game's one of the best kind of action games. It also has horrier scince in gaming with a lot of different zombies.There's some extra part of game that you play them through the gaming. It's during of:Versus - Mercenaries - Mercenaries reunion - Lost in nightmares and ... .So if you wanna have good time and exciting playing I recommend you to try it.Thq.:)			"

												Finally decided to do a RE marathon since I had never really finished any of them. This one blew me away! I played it on a projector on the giant screen with 3D using Tridef software  (the default NVidia 3D was flat and very blah). Pretty good 3D and the graphics were amazing even by today's standards. The storyline wasn't too bad either. I like how they bring back characters and develop the story further. Difficulty level was fair as I don't play these to prove to myself I can beat it on ""insane"" or whatever modes are above normal. I kept trying to play it closer to its release date but just kept getting distracted. I'm sure glad I waited this long because I was able to play it on a proper setup, given how incredible it looked on the big screen. Excellent game and I had no glitches aside from having to switch over to the DS4 as the Steam and this game didn't seem to like each other.			"

												Amazing Resident Evil! You get to explore africa and not catch AIDS!!! BUt really heres the review!Samething as RE4 just different place, new encounters, new inventory system, and more weapons.Coop is on here so you can always play with a friend.AI (ur teammate) can run out of ammo so your job is to help her out if you want.Graphics are beautiful and cool little secrets are in the game.Once you beat the game you will get a mode called ""Mercenaries"". Cool game type for coop or if you just wanna see how many points you can get. Downfalls.. DLC from xbox360 is NOT IN THE GAME!			"

												Campaign is long  and awesome. The graphics demand is so low that even my simple laptop can run it 50FPS. Mercenaries and mercenaries reunion makes it a million times more worth it. Wish there were more merc maps though. If you are more used to RE6, you'll find that the movement in this game is stiffer (similar to RE4), but this inventory is much better.9.5/10			"

												Old game but its great. Now with steamworks. You can transfer your old saves, achievments and equipment from games for windows live which is great! got my few thousand bullets for each gun back :PIt's got incredible replayability value which has been increased with new dlc that was console exclusive. The graphic is acceptably nice (and can be tweaked like blur and hdr in the .ini file to High to make it look even better). After all these years this is still one of best resident evil games (better than 6 anyway).Pros:+ nice story+ full story coop!+ now with steamworks!+ huge replayability value+ acceptable graphics+ consle exclusive dlc is out for pc's thanks to steam! (not microsoft which didnt care!)+ controller support+ mercenary mode which has been expanded with more content thx to the dlc+ really hard professional difficultyCons:- outdated controls from 2003 (not an issue once get used to)- extremely dumb ai- too short story :P9/10Revelations 2 RAID mode picks up from greatness of RE5 mercenary mode and improves it hugely. Those two games have the best raid modes in entire series (at least for me)To sum things up, Resident Evil 5 is a classic game that will not dissapoint you and will deliver countless hours of fun solo or with friends. It is definetly worth every penny!			"

												I just bought this game recently, great story line but horrible a.i. If you are gonna play this game make sure its with someone else lol!! if not your teammate will burn through ammo and make the game that much harder where you are running around trying not to get hit with the knife. You are still able to run direct x 11 with this game. So it still a current gen game. The controls take a while to get use too, but other than that another 3rd person action game. Not the throwback that people are use to atleast on the playstation. I will still recommend this game for the decent story, graphics, as well as coop play!			"

												It may say I have spent around 9 hours on steam. But I have around 80~ hours on Xbox360.Let me start this off by saying my review may be a little biased. I have played every resident evil available to the public. I was raised on resident evil. I played my first at age eight. I have loved them all. My favorites being resident evil 3, 4, and outbreak files 1 and 2. I love zombies, you love zombies? resident evil 5 is not a ""zombie game"" it's barely even a ""biohazard"" game. the majority of the enemies you fight will resemble people, will act like people, will fight like people. And the ""zombie"" aspects of these ""people"" are very minimal. but still, it is a Resident Evil. it is co-op, has collectables, money, weapon upgrades, a decent amount of weapons, the herbs we know and love, and character skins. Fun stuff, endless hours of fun.Why is this review negative? Because this game might have the absolute worst AI, worst storyline, worst boss fights, and best cover based shooter atmosphere a resident evil game has ever had.AI: Example; (those that played the game will understand, if you have not, google the key figures) After aquiring the second machine-gun and leaving the warehouse where you are greeted with the ocean and two abandoned half-sunken ships. I began by destroying one of the wall mines and moving forward, Sheva on ""cover"" with her pistol out. She ran ahead of me into the arms of the first spawning enemy in the area and she didn't fire a single bullet and was grabbed. I saved her and the enemy was in a wounded position. I moved in to punch the target and Sheva kicked him, subsequently hitting me and knocking me to the ground. I got up and began to knife the downed target. During this time Sheva shot me three times in the back and reloaded. we moved forward and I dispatched every enemy while sheva fired six more bullets into my back. We approached the three dog fight. She did not fire at a single dog and was hit four times by dogs. I killed all of them with my shotgun. I set sheva to assualt and she switched to her machine-gun. she proceeded to fire on a crossbow wielding enemy standing above the dog spawn. the man fell to the ground and she proceeded to fill this man with 30 machine-gun rounds. I decided to back-track and search for items we may have missed. I found an herb and a first-aid spray. I gave her the first aid spray to hold onto. she immediately used it. (Me at 100% health, her at 75% health)  I sighed and we moved on to a back side area protected by a wall-mine but gave access to the area via ladder. I climbed the ladder and hopped down to the area. Beginning to loot i was greeted with an explosive directly behind me and I was thrown forward. Behind my surprised ♥♥♥ was a bleeding out and dying Sheva. I proceeded to Ctrl+alt+del and quit the game. This isn't the first and won't be the last time the AI has disappointed me.(Spoilers)Storyline: Long story short. Series of boss fights with a dozen handouts where you are ""saved"" in cutscene all while looking for your BFF, Bio-weapons, Scientist-Mc-man, Super Wesker, ♥♥♥♥-Mc-gee and Tri-Cell, I mean umbrella2.0. you find Bio-weapons, you find scientist-mc-man(who becomes a bio-weapon, you find ♥♥♥♥-mc-gee(she becomes a bio-weapon), you find Super Wesker(he was already a bio-weapon), and you find BFF(who has a bio-weapon in her ♥♥♥♥) using the power of friendship you find Super Wesker again, he becomes even more super then you get on a plane, and Quick-Time-Event simulator happens. Then you fight Super Super wesker the Meat-Tornado in a volcano, punch a rock, and save the world. Resident Evil/Biohazard is a game series in which you fight the nightmares of Man-kind. Bio-terrorist/weapons that turn the living into the dead, and the dead into the undead or worse. Here I feel like I'm fighting people.. all the time. Resident Evil should stick to zombies, not this crazed axe wielding human ♥♥♥♥. >Should I get this game? Yes. It's a good game. Well optimized, difficulties, collectables, upgrades, co-op, PvP, etc. It's a solid game. But do not play this game alone. AI will make you hate this game.			"

												Im not sure what made me hate this game first time through. It has all the things I loved about Resident Evil 4 with the addition of co-op. The story is definitely Resident Evil-esque meaning its over the top and ridiculous but thats what makes it  Resident Evil. Its not really a horror game at this stage but its still enjoyable.You have:-Gun Upgrading-Treasures to collect-Crazy Unlockable weapons-Replay Value-Mercenaries mode-Decent amount of costumes-The game is optimized wellIf you find it for under $20 then I'd definitely pick it up. (Just a tip: If you want to play in a resolution over 1920x1080 you should try a program called ""Flawless Widescreen"" you can mess with your FOV and what not to make it more appealing and it also allows you to play in any resolution you desire)			"

												A mediocre game but a lazy port job. Includes a decent amount of options, however horrible controls. Movement feels sluggish at times in comparison to previous Resident Evil games; It is especially worse when playing with a controller, although it doesn't seem to get much better when using a mouse and keyboard.Aside from the port: The gameplay keeps you on edge. Enemies can approach you from ANY and ALL directions. There are various bosses you will encounter, and you will have several different, although similiar ways of getting past them. It can often become very challenging - even repetitive. You focus far too much on shooting your way out of almost every level, rather than considering a more 'tactical' approach as you may do so in previous games.One of the ""better"" things about Resident Evil 5 is the integration of CO-OP. I'll admit, it's a mess. Although players continue to suffer the many issues of multiplayer, it definitely seemed like a good idea from a player's standpoint - being able to play with friends can make the overall experience more enjoyable for some.My final rating is a 6/10. Why do I recommend this game? Simply put, it is a game that you can waste a decent amount of time playing, even if you won't be missing out on much if you were to pass it up.			"

												Death by reloadingRE5 is a great game spoiled by atrocious controls. I mean the worst ever. These are the main problems: You can’t move while reloading, aiming, or shooting; instead you become rooted to the spot and therefore hopelessly vulnerable to attack. When aiming the sight is often (although, oddly, not always) wrenched away from the point already centred so you have to find your target again. And you can’t jump or crouch unless prompted. What the hell is that all about? Also the AI is pretty poor. Sheva gets in the way more often than not. The UI looks like something out of the 90s and is clunky to say the least. And you can’t access the inventory during gameplay (although I understand the reasoning behind this it is frustrating at times). So what is there to like? Well it looks amazing. The graphics are among the best I’ve ever seen, with particularly impressive character models and animations. And, controls aside, the gameplay is enjoyable, with a good selection of environments, some pretty tough bosses, and a range of simple but enjoyable puzzles to solve. Ammo is often scarce so you have to be more thoughtful about your approach to the combat than in many games. Overall it’s a top-flight game marred only but it’s poorly designed controls and interface. Sadly these are so bad I can only give it 3 out of 5, which is a real shame.3/5			"

												One of the greatest Resident Evil games IMO. It may not be a Survival Horror game anymore, but the coop is awesome. One of the best action coop games I've played so far. Great amount of weapons, nice extra missions (like BSAA emblems and treasures), and good online after the main story with The Mercenaries. Archievements are also good, and it takes some time to get them all.RE6 may be newest, I still prefer this one. Not being able to move while you shoot or reload your weapon make it special and different of other action games, and it's something characteristic of the saga.I'll never get tired of this game when I have someone to play with. Totally recommened!			"
