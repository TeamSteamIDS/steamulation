												The best strategy game I've ever played. A must have for all strategy games lovers.This game is quite old so don't expect any high-end graphics or controls.If you have trouble with playing this game on Windows 7 or Vista you can find an .exe on the official forums. This game has a very long campaign and is very fun in the Coop mode with 2 other players. The content of this game is enormous reaching from 6 races with their own buildings, units and technologies to more than 100 different spells for your avatar. With over 3 campaigns which tell an epic story and a coop mode with over 40 maps which each take approximately about an hour dependig on how you play this game can be fun for a long time.			"

												Guys, honestly:This game is GREAT! It's not much of a true RTS, it's more like a little bit of an economical base building, in which you will build buildings that are huge and you can walk in third person through your base, which is great!The races feel extremly different and are all fun to play.The maps are all well thought out and have you take a different approach to them.The graphics of course are incredibly dated, but hey, it runs on every potatoe now!The RPG elements are not that huge, but you can definetly customize your character to your liking. The spells are really creative, especially the mental magic ones. Just try them out in free play!You can sink hours upon hours into this game. You will remember each and every single track of the music, as it's so greatly done.Just buy it :) It's worth every buck you pay for it!			"

												If you enjoy third person action titles or RTS games, and enjoy some really good battles in between building and resource gathering all wrapped around a good vs. evil story which is interesting and contains some decent plot twists, you will definitely want to check out Spellforce.Its success at blending all of its parts together into a smoothly flowing, finely-crafted whole are more than just the final word in the development of the game; it’s a testament to the thought that went into blending the best features of two of the most complex genres in gaming, and creating an interface that’s easily accessible and suitably detailed.The music and visuals are excellent. And you know what? So is the core play of the game. There's a lot of innovation here in SpellForce. Although parts of it are rough around the edges, there's too much good gameplay here to pass up.It is neither the best RTS nor the best RPG out there. However, SpellForce offers enough of a quality experience in both genres, packaged in a pretty environment that you could spend dozens of hours exploring as a Warrior of the Rune.There haven't been a lot of games that manage to combine large scale strategy and role-playing together and be successful. Phenomic has made a damn good stab at it with this one though.			"

												Pros:The plot is suprisingly good for a game like this, but it can get a little cheesy at times.The game dosen't look to bad for it's time.You get many classes to choose from.You can infuse other classes together (like for instance, you can have a warrior healer class).The game is long.The online mode is pretty decent, both pvp and co-op (I didn't spend to long on it so don't take my word for it).You get two dlc's (which I haven't played yet).All charcters are voice acted.You control large epic battles that'll make you hungry for more.Cons:You can't use your singleplayer charcter online, you need to make seperate charcters, which isn't to bad, but I thought it should be mentionedEven though you have a wide choice of player classes, you'll feel as if they are kinda usless during big battles.The units can be a pain in the a** to control sometimes.The heros don't level up so they constantly need to be replaced.There isn't to much help as to where to go, sure if you keep going without backtracking you'll be fine, but if you go back for sidequests or whatever you'll most likely get lost for a good hour.You are slow as f***, and that dosen't help since 50% of the game consists of running around from place to place.The game can get real repetitive sometimes, and you will most likely quit becuase of it.Despite the cons, this is a great game, and I highly recomend it, even at full price.

												SpellForce.. this game, almost perfection>Game DescriptionTo start, SpellForce is a rather well done hybrid of an RPG and an RTS, with both aspects of the game being rather good. Most of the game revolves around your hero, who is a ''Rune Warrior'', and has the ability to activate different types of monuments and such, which are able to summon Avatars, who are weaker heroes, but a force to be reckoned, especially in RPG maps. You're also able to activate monuments of different races, which are able to summon a specific race's workers or warriors(presuming you meet the requirements). Summoning workers or Avatars also consumesyour rune power, which determines the rate at which the workers or Avatars are summoned, and recovers slowly. Now, for the RTS part, it is combined with the RPG part, as you need to find blueprints to be able to build more advanced buildings or units, and you must also find worker runes to increase the power of your units. The game has 3 lenghty campaigns, and a free play mode. As for me, I'm playing the free play mode currently, where you have free choice of what map you play, or what race you play.Pros : +Lenghty campaign+Well-done hybrid of RTS and RPG+Half-naked women in loading screens+Plenty of hero customizationCons : -Somewhat bad translation-Spells require you to find a higher level scroll to level up-Walking from one part of the map to another can get tiring at times[8.5/10]			"

												This game is a huge Nostalgia burst for me, I bought it cheap in 2006 and just played the crap out of it. If you're into RPG games and like RTS games, this is one of the most underrated games ever. However nothing is perfect. Other than a few translation errors and the most bored sounding voice actors since Resident Evil. Other than this, I love this game. For Aonir's Honour!			"

												I've simply spent to much time playing this game (non-steam version) to give it something else than positive recommendation. Yes, it has some flaws. But as soon as you get used to saving game very often and occasionaly waiting for your avatar to reach the other edge of the map, Spellforce can offer you a perfect RPG-strategy combinated gameplay, with lots of sidequests and variety of items and spells.

												One of the first strategy games I started playing as a kid and loved.The Spellforce universe holds a lot of potential and the Platinum Edition adds two expansions, the Breath of Winter and Shadow of the Phoenix.The story is good for a real time strategy game, it follows the path of a rune warrior and his struggles to free the shattered lands of Eo and free himself from his bond with the Circle.The gameplay is unique, I love it so much that I have played the Order of Dawn for years and seeing this edition on Steam was another reason to replay it. The base building was so refreshing in this game, using Rune monuments as the center for recruitment of armies and workers. Aside from the monuments dedicated to the humans, elves, dwarves, orcs, trolls and dark elves, there are also monuments for heroes that you can customize.The way the six nations play out is simply amazing, each nations gathers resources in its own way and have different uses, for example, the humans and dwarves can double their iron income but the elves don’t even have a building for it, they counter this disadvantage with having the ability to build foresters that can rebuild forests and maintain a almost infinite supply of wood. These base building and army recruitment details really enhance the experience for RTS fans. The customization of your characters and heroes’ weapons and skills also add to this, there are also a huge variety of weapons, armor and spells to choose from as you go through the game. The way you play the game really rewards you with different situations, I prefer the warrior gameplay but after playing as a mage I did find it more of a challenge to get through the game. To add to this, there’s also a fantastic soundtrack included and beautiful graphics for its age. As for downsides, I didn’t find many aside from a few bugs but nothing game breaking.I really hope that this mix of RTS/RPG returns in the future, anyone who likes fantasy real time strategy games will definitely enjoy this game, I personally count it as one of my favorite strategy games. It’s well worth its price even if you're not that into the RTS genre.			"

												Dont let you fool by the low Meta-Score: SpellForce is a great game and a hidden gem, even more if you regard the price for the platinum edition.It is by no means perfect, and can become really annoying at times, but it still is one of the best games i have played this year!About pros and cons:One the negative side, this game does neither feel like ""real"" role play nor like ""deep"" strategy.The strategy part is extremely simple, without real tactics involved, and the role playing part leaves very little room for character developement.Additionaly, the game gets repetetive, and at times, unfair, which means, that your main objectives  are, to defeat all opponents, which will produce endless units, the further you get the more, until you stop them.And finally, theres a lack in comfort. Moving around a map is painfully slow, and every time you re-enter a map, you have to discover it anew. On the positive side, theres a lenghty campaign (easily 100+ hours, if you plan to finish every quest in the game, which i strongly recommend), including a great and interesting story, different races with unique buildings and units, tons of side quests and stuff to explore, beautiful graphics and sound, great atmosphere, very intuitive controls, a great interface and a lot of fun!After all those hours, i still have plenty to do, lots of motivation and the digital world has really grown on me. Rediscovering known places in order to finish a new side quest, feels like coming home, as i have so many memories about every world.I really am getting sad, that SpellForce will come to an end, and that there wont be any more challenges after i beat the game...I usually dont like and play real-time, but this game is different. I would buy it again any time, and have already purchased the complete second part as well!Every chance to get to play more SpellForce is very welcome!Everybody who likes strategy and role-playing will love this game!

												One of the best strategy/RPG games ever. I you want to play, get ready to spend a lot of hours in front of your PC.The main game ( The Order of Dawn ) is a great time for new players. You can easily learn the basics of the game enjoying the story which - by the way - is very long and addictive. Even changing the difficulty on HARD, you may ""max"" your character without unnecessary sweating.But the DLC's... That's something else. As for my opinion, the DLC's are for very experienced gamers. Enemies are much stronger even on first world. But, as we know, every medal has a two sides. Behind the hard gamplay is one more, long story line which you will enjoy even more than the main.In sum - If you have a lot of free time and you searching for good strategy/RPG, then the SpellForce is the game that you were looking for. I assure, that there is no option that you won't enjoy the gameplay and story. But if somehow you will decide that, the game s*cks, write a message to me, for sure I will change your mind :)			"

												Spellforce - Platinum Edition is a must have for all those who enjoy RTS/RPG type mechanics. Spellforce boasts a truly lengthy campaign, gorgeous visuals, unique mechanics, diversity in lore - factions, landscapes, etc... fantastic ambience, and an excellent soundtrack! Spellforce delivers a staggering selection of weaponry, armour, spells, and other miscellanous items - with a fair amount of customization, post-character creation. Spellforce IS a well scripted game, but unfortunately suffers in the voiced audio department (as each and every character in the game seems to speak in a perpetually monotone voice with major lack of expressions and tone), and if that doesn't turn you away (as it shouldn't), Spellforce delivers on all fronts as a polished, refined, and exceptionally well-crafted product. Spellforce is a top notch singleplayer experience, and delivers it's entertainment in a great many of ways. I highly recommend this excellent title!			"

												After 1000h+ of playing it after realease I decided to pay the game on Steam as a tribute for great work that JoWood (Gaben was also glad coz of cas$ on his Valve-Pocket) did while creating the awsomeness of doing a RTS / RPG hybrid with a such twisted plot that i even after a lot of time dont completely undestand. It is the first game i was more affected and fascinated about doing side quests instead of the main plot (that was absolutely hilarious). The graphic got since 2006 a bit ugly at all, but it should not be an argument to play that aswome game! (for playing the game and only the game i am using a 4:3 monitor - thats dedication :-)  because the resolution in game have not been patched till now and the manual ""thingy"" only stretches it and doing the game uglier)10/10 Jowood thank you that you enriched my childhood with Spellforce.

												A unique blend of RPG/RTS which while old and clunky by today's standard is still a worthwhile game for anyone interested in this niche genre.PROS: 1. Many different ways of building and playing your player character.2. While the game has familiar races ( elves, dwarves etc. ) the setting overall is more original.3. Races are sufficiently different in strengths and weaknesses to give a sense of renewal as progress is achieved through the main quest ( race played is determined by the level being played and not by choice most of the time ).4. Great sense of growing in power with your player character.CONS:1. The RTS part aka selecting, organising and commanding your army is clunky and a bit underdeveloped.2. It is possible to build your player character wrong and end up weaker than expected for later levels. Although it should       also  still be possible to beat the game through either a good army or good use of NPC heroes. ( WARNING THE GAME DOESN'T TELL YOU THAT THE 3RD CAMPAIGN HAS A LVL CAP OF 50  SO BUILD WITH THAT IN MIND )3. Because of the fact that you start each map from scratch for the RTS ( building a base and recruiting an army ) the game becomes a bit tedious. There is also the fact that sometimes you might just want to farm some exp which can also become boring.			"

												While it certainly has its flaws, Spellforce is an old gem. The main campaign is lengthy, getting through it took me about 90 hours, the story is quite fascinating as well. The RPG part of game is well developed, there are lots of side quests that make exploration rewarding and encourage you to step away from the main storyline. Apart from the main character, you also control up to five different heroes. The RTS part is also cleverly designed - an army is tied to the monument of the respective race, which also provides you workers to build a base. The number of structures of each race is quite big and there is room for customization, as you acquire building and unit plans through exploration usually tied to the main storyline but at times leading you to places you would never think of checking out. The fact that the main character is a rune warrior possessing worker and hero runes also makes the RTS part slightly more believable than usual.The game highly favours a warrior type of character (such a character is, at times, even able to solo entire areas) and you might find yourself struggling if you decide to play a mage. Nevertheless, there is a variety of interesting spells and magic branches for you to explore, inviting those who demand a bit of a bigger challenge to choose their own path. Your small party of heroes can potentially be more efficient and less time consuming than an army and one could argue that base building seems pointless at times, but that is up to the player to decide.To name a few flaws as well, the AI seems to be amazingly stupid at times and the translation isn't that splendid - there are a few spelling mistakes and some inconsistency, an example being the area Frost Marshes, which is referred to in the game with three different names. Despite its flaws, the game is well worth checking out. If you're looking for a more simplified and friendlier experience, you might prefer the sequel, but I would definitely recommend this game to any fan of either genre. The platinum edition also contains two long and challenging expansions, which, in my opinion, makes it more than worth the price.			"

												Have you come looking for the best game ever? In my opinion, you've come to the right place.  This is a unique mix of RTS/RPG game, with great story, interesting characters (sometimes very cliche, can't hide that), epic battles, and... and stuff.Elements:+GRAPHICS - now some of you would probably say 'w8 w0t m8?' looking at the screenshots, but I played this game since it came out, and it hasn't aged a bit. It's still fun to watch your avatar stab a goblin to death, then send an Ice Bolt at another one for Crowd Control purposes, and let your follower warrior do that overhead smash for tons of damage. Units were quite diverse, and THOSE BUILDINGS... Elven and Dwarvish architecture is just so much fitting, I can't express that. +MUSIC - I don't have a slightest idea who the main composer was, but give that man a cookie. Or Grammy. Dunno, maybe both. Music fits every map, let's say you're in a forest kind of area, it gives you a soothing tune, yet when the battle takes place, it changes to war drums etc. +RPG ELEMENTS++CHARACTERYou control a Rune Warrior (male/female, 26 faces each), a human bound to a rune of a powerful Circle Mage (in your case it's Rohen, the Ice Nuke guy), which grants you immortality for a price of eternal servitude, unless the owner of the rune gives it to you, granting you free will again (while retaining immortality). Some of you are probably already at 'woah woah woah what's the point of the game if I am immortal?'. I hastily answer: Immortal doesn't mean unbeatable. When your HP drops to zero, you respawn at a last activated Menhir (few of those stones are on every map), and some time passes so your army/some of the building could already be gone without you noticing. Now, abilities and attributes. Every time you level up, you gain 5 attribute and 2 ability points, BUT abilities require you to have certain attribute value each time you want to increase them, so forget those dreams about CON based fire mage if you want to max out fire magic. There are a lot of good builds, for starters I would propose a fighter (these ones are easier to play first time) with Heavy Armor, Heavy weapons, STR-CON, some DEX for accuracy purposes (gotta get dem damages up bruh). You can get up to level 30 in basic game, and 50 in addons, so you don't ruin a build by mistake (which is irreversable). Character transpones between addons.++ABILITIES/SKILLSLet me just explain what does each skill doLIGHT COMBAT ARTS - light armors, daggers, small blunts, evade stuffHEAVY COMBAT ARTS - hello, my name is Mr Tank, and this is Jackass. RANGED COMBAT - pew, pew pew, pew pew pew pew, pewELEMENTAL MAGIC - fireballs, meteor strikes, rains of ice, basic nuker kitWHITE MAGIC - heal stuff, buff stuffMIND MAGIC -mage remover, mana upkeepBLACK MAGIC - death magic (pure dps), necromancy, diseases++ATTRIBUTESStrength - hit stuff harderStamina - get hit longerDexterity - hit stuff instead of missingAgility- dont get hit by stuffIntelligence - mana regenWisdom - more manaCharisma - better healing and mind magic++SPELLSYou get spells from scrolls you drop/buy (mage trees), or automatically (warrior trees). They look great, sound great, feel great. 1v5? Berserk Rage and 2-shot every enemy. Enemy army approaching? Rain of Ice combined with archers. Own army below 20% hp? Mass healing, aaaaand it's all healed. RPG map too hard? Dominate that enemy to kill stuff for you++STORYIt's linear, and you have 0 choices, but the plot keeps you interested, and DAYUM THAT TWIST.  Characters feel like they belong to the world, voice acting is top notch, there are a lot of side quests with interesting rewards. Also, much lore, very information IN EVERY DIALOGUE.++COMPANIONSYou get up to five rune warriors as companions, but  think of them like a pair of gloves. ""Oh, the new rune of a warrior, 2 STR more than current, guess who is getting replaced"". They don't have dialogues, story, treat them as pawns.+RTS ELEMENTS++ARMY SYSTEM IN GENERALTo summon an army, you have to reach a monument on the map. There are 6 races (3 light, 3 dark), each has a corresponding monument. Fun: if you put light race next to dark race, they are going to fight with each other, regardless of your orders, so plan army movements carefully on a map with two monuments. Now, back to the topic. Once at a monument, you can first summon workers, which gather resources, and build structures for more efficient gathering, for defense, or for recruitment. You can only build structures which plans you have found - you get those during the main plot, so you can start with like 8 structures for a race on first map, and end up with 20 later on. Same rules apply to units, you start with 2 kinds, end with like 9. ++RACESHumans - crossbow turrets, healers, mind mages, marksmen (one of best units early game)Elves - wooden turrets, wooden buildings, ice magic, only race in the game that can produce wood (grows trees)Dwarves - only race without turrets. Why? Defenders. Imagine an army of heavy armored dwarves throwing hammers at you. fun? Now imagine that each kill levels up a dwarf (up to +5), increasing his health and damageOrcs - burn stuff, smash stuffTrolls - throw rocks at stuff, smash stuff harderDark Elves - death magic, necromancy++BATTLES Up to 80 army size per side, best tactics: put dem units in a group and press H (stop). If you dont press stop, healers will not heal, mages will not cast spells, archers will move around after every shot. H is love, H is life, H is efficient killing. +MULTIPLAYERYou can play with friends in a group of 2 or 3, but only through Hamachi since GameSpy servers are no longer in existence, but the gameplay looks like this: 3 monuments vs 20 enemy camps, survive until you can build enough defense to safely raise an army and slowly clean a map. Sounds boring, but it isn't. I played all of the 50 multiplayer maps with friends, in 2015, IT WAS SO MUCH FUN.Now, to summarize...PROS:+looks great, sounds great+complex character development system+epic battles on RTS maps and...+small group adventures on RPG maps+hours of fun+multiplayer still working+plot+dialoguesCONS:-multiplayer requires hamachi-multiplayer map can take over an hour (which is nice), but in case of disconnecting, reconnect is impossible-easy to ruin a character if you didn't plan it beforehandNow, should you play Spellforce? Yup. 10/10. Best game ever.			"

												If you like the newer Spellforce games, it's worth playing this just to see where the weird RPG + RTS combo gameplay started!  The world the gameplay is set against is kind of interesting in its own way, but the storyline the game follows is actually pretty bad and the english voice acting is extremely low budget (see: the original Deus Ex only worse).The expansions can be extremely challenging but also sort of emphasizes the storytelling side of things a bit more.  There's a lot more questy stuff going on.Wait for a sale or something.  Unless it's already cheap!			"

												Spellforce is a Real Time Strategy/RPG hybrid, and a great one at that. If you can get past the initial weirdness and clunkiness of the game, you are in for a wild ride.First of all, the gameplay feels pretty unique, considering that this type of hybrid game hasn't been done too often. You get your main character who you can skill and develop in a multitude of ways, some, admittedly, more fun and effective than others, and you get the base-building portion. There are six races you play through over the course of the story, all of them fun to play as in their own way. You don't get to choose which race you play at which point in time though, the campaign is a bit rigid in that aspect. No biggie though.While we are at the story, it's nothing too special. It's good. But the game is long.Holy HELL is it long. I mean, you can easily spend upwards of 40-50 hours on a single campaign if you haven't played the game before, and it comes with two expansions, which are at least 30 hours long. Each.Atmospherically speaking, the game has a lot to offer in my opinion. The maps look and feel great, and the soundtrack is AMAZING.And then there is the so-called ""Click and Fight-System"". It's a really simple thing that makes so much sense and it absolute baffles me that it hasn't become a standard for RTS games. Instead of just issuing orders by clicking the unit and then clicking the enemy, you can instead click the enemy and it shows you all possible actions your friendly units can do to it. It's hard to explain without pictures, but if you play and see it, you'll know what I mean. It's efficient, it's intuitive, it's really damn smart.The game definitely has some flaws though. It's pretty old by now so the graphics are dated, even though I personally have no problem with that. It has no widescreen support, and forcing it makes the UI weird, so my recommendation is windowed mode.Another flaw is that the game is a bit minimalistic on giving you information and stats about enemies, units and yourself. You get a non-numbered health bar, a non-numbered mana bar, a very brief description of the spells you have, but that's pretty much it. There is no way to know how much armor ANYONE except you has, there is no way to know how much damage one unit will deal to another without trying it out, you don't know anything about the damage, range, duration, effect etc. about the spells you, a friendly unit or an enemy uses, and so on. The best you get is a number above a unit's head that shows how much damage it took.If you can deal with that, you're pretty much set. This is a true hidden gem and worth the money. If you see it on sale, consider buying it. "

												What a wonderful game and underrated at the same time. I never expected a game i randomly bought on sale can made me play this much. It have interesting story, even make me surprise at some points. You can freely customize your character, choose your playing style, transfer from one map to another,...At it's time, i don't think you can find many RTS games have RPG elements, Day-Night Cycle, and both 1st, 3rd person view. Believe me that 1st person view can create a whole new experience. About voice acting i don't think i like it but other than this, i love this game. Can't wait for SpellForce 3 which story takes place before Order of Dawn.			"

												Spellforce does a good job of combining RTS with RPG. RPG elements: First you start off with a low-level hero of your choice. You can be almost everything: form a simple sword fighting warrior to a mage using various spells to destroy his enemies. Every class, like in almost every RPG, requires a different style of play and if you cannot decide which class you prefer you can combinate them.From the start you always have a main quest active which guides you through the story and to the next map. But it is always worth it to leave the main path and look for some side quests which reward you with additional EXP and sometimes with a pretty neat item.Now to the RTS elements of the game: On almost every map you face a hord of enemies your hero cannot deal with alone. So, you can summon workers at monuments of various tribes (humans, elves, orc, etc.) to gather ressources, build a base and produce units to help you in battle. Every tribe has its own buildings and units, therefore the gameplay with each tribe is slightly different. On some maps you can summon up to 5 heros, who can be equiped with items. You can control this heros like your main character. So, instead of building up a whole base you play through the map with just a small group of heros.If it comes to a big battle, you quickly lose track of some units (e.g. you heros). For these situations there is a bar at the top of the screen where you can see all important informations and available spells of your heros and get the current position. For different perspectives you can zoom in or out and rotate the map. There is also the possibility to control your hero individually in third-person perspective and via WASD-keys, which is nice to immerse more into the well designed world. But most of the time there is no advantage of this view. What I really like aobut the  game: The variety of how to skill your hero is enormous. As I already mentioned: Everything is possible from a sword swinging strong warrior to a mighty spellcasting wizard. First I played the game with a combination of healer and heavy tank which worked out quite well. My second char was a complete black mage that could be easily killed in close combat, but the enemies had a hard time reaching it.Furthermore, the design of the many different maps is well done. Each map got its own charm and it never got boring.What I do not like about the game: Some maps are pretty hard to beat because of huge amounts of enemies that are so strong you can only kill them by luring them away from a group and kill them one by one. That takes a lot of time and can be very frustrating, because you have a constant feeling that your character is too low leveled, although you already have done every possible sidequest and gathering a good amount of EXP at an enemy spawnpoint takes ages.Conclusion:Spellforce is a nice combination of RPG and RTS. The urge to level my hero and to loot more and more items got me at the very first minute. Whenever I got to play with a new tribe I was curious of finding out what its advantages and disadvantages are. The story is nothing special, but it is well told. The design of the maps and units is rich in variety, so you always get something new to see. And if you bring enough time and patience to sit through a hard time completing a map, I would recommend this game.			"

												""Spellforce"" ist das mir einzige bekannte Spiel, dass RPG und Strategie so gut in sich vereint. Auf dieses Spiel kann eine ganze Menge Zeit verwendet werden, da man alle nur erdenklichen Kombinationen bei der Fertigkeitenwahl des Avatars probieren kann. Das Spiel hält dabei nicht nur epische Schlachten gegen Bosse offen, sondern ist sehr vielfältig, da den Spieler diverse Quests (Haupt-, sowie Nebenquests) erwarten, die Aufgaben an sich sehr spannend sind in Bezug zu ihrer Geschichte, aber auch nicht ""nur rohe Aufgaben"" eingebaut wurden. Die Graphik empfinde ich als sehr angenehm. (Ich bin allerdings auch kein sonderlicher Graphik-Fanatiker. Zudem sollte man das Alter des Spiels berücksichtigen.)Das für mich Faszinierendste am gesamten Spiel ist und bleibt jedoch die Geschichte, die dahinter steckt. Sie ist sehr spannend und hält den Spieler bei der Rolle. SIe zieht sich zudem durch alle drei Teile von ""Spellforce"" (das Hauptspiel ""The Order of Dawn"" und die beiden Erweiterungen ""Breath of Winter"" und ""Shadow of the Phoenix"") durch, sodass die Geschichte von Teil zu Teil fortgeführt wird und die Story komplettiert. Es können jedoch alle drei Teile unabhängig gespielt werden, was ich aufgrund der faszinierenden Story nicht empfehle.Daher kann ich nur sprichwörtlich sagen: ""Das Spiel war und ist jeden einzelnen Penny wert."" und kann es jedem nur empfehlen, sofern man etwas für das Genre offen hat.

												I love this game. I could play it over and over for the rest of my life...the combination of RPG and RTS makes it so much more than either of the 2 genres alone, a spectacular blend that adds an undefinable dimension to the gameplay and really immerses a person in the story. Try it, you won't be disappointed!			"

												There are two main reasons I love this game, one is the storyline which involved numerous characters and locations, and lots of twists and surprises. It is also long. The story itself happens over a long list of areas, and sub quests will have you going back and forth between areas all the time, and each map can take up to a couple hours if you play like me and amass as big an army as you can before you head out. Second is the actual gameplay of each area. Quite often the overall objective is to destroy the enemy base, or to get to something behind the base, but there will be things along the way like a graveyard off to the side with ghouls that will also attack your base, or a village under siege who will give you resources if you help them. Quite often you will find things you can interact with that you have no idea about only to later find the side quest that takes you there which lead to a lot of exclamations of, ""So that's what that was for!"" Sometimes though you will get areas where you have to fight with just your main hero and rune heroes and the dynamic shifts considerably. Suddenly that one powerful healing mage who can aoe heal your army  and keep them going a bit longer, takes a bit more of a backstep and changes spells to join in the action himself with his weapon. I found these segments quite fun as going from the army building action to a map where you only had your heroes made it feel very much like you were an elite force behind enemy lines.The animation doesn't look too bad and my only gripe with the voice acting is that there is only one voice for each gender. But that is a small gripe as i can see why there is only one when there is so much dialogue throughout the story. I haven't done much multiplayer (mostly because I haven't found someone to go do it with since I don't like randoms) but what I have done has been great.Overall, Spellforce is probably my favorite RTS because it isn't just an RTS, and it uses the blended elements really well.Oh, and everything I just said? That's just the first campain. It's the same again for the second and third. Be prepared to spend ages playing this as in order to do the side quests and all the campains will take you a long time. Each campain has a different story and each is as good a story as the last.Still reading? Stop, and start playing. You won't regret it.			"

												Spellforce is one of those few (or many) PC classic gaming gems, it's also one of those few good hybrids, this one mixes the one-man combat of an RPG with the strategy of an RTS.This game is basically Lord of the Rings with a twist, the world is broken up into smallish islands and you play as whats called a Rune Warrior which are a group of people bound to a ""master"" that carries their rune, you can have a bunch of other Rune Warriors follow you too you start off with one and you get an extra slot every 5 or 10 levels.There are sets of skills you can aquire by leveling up too, you start off when creating a character with one of these skills sets, there are 6 skill sets with 2 melee sets, 4 magic sets and a dedicated ranged combat set. Each combat set has an average of three skills per set, some have more and some have less.To create a character you can choose to be a man or a woman and chose from a set of heads, aswell as your starting skill and stats, each skill requires a different set of stat(s) to level it up.There are three campaigns, the Order of Dawn campaign (simply called ""Campaign"") which you play as the Phoenix Bearer (although at the time he doesn't know it)The second campaign is the Breath of Winter you play as again a Rune Warrior who later in the game has a weapon called the ""Shadow Blade"".In the third and fourth campaigns you can import a character from the Order of Dawn or Breath of Winter campaigns (asuming you finished them) there are two campaigns, you get a different character based on what campaign you did before, in the Order of Dawn you get the Phoenix campaign and in the Breath of Winter you get the Shadow Blade.Aswell as the four epic campaigns there are two multiplayer modes, Free Game Mode which was added in The Breath of Winter expansion pack which allows you to go through maps that you see in the campaigns, aswell as a few maps made just for Free Mode, you can play solo or with another two friends through LAN and online through the now dead Gamespy server, (although i think some awesome person has made a patch to fix that (hopfuly)), Playing in co-op is more enjoyable than playing by yourself, having buddies to play with has it's pros and cons like being able to have a larger force since each player has their own pop cap and you need to defend more than one base, although this isn't always a problem because in some maps you spawn fairly close to geather, in fact in some maps you spawn right next to each other.Aswell as the co-op Free Game Mode you can play some PvP style multiplayer which up to two teams of three duel it out and in the Breath of Winter expansion pack you can use characters from Free Game Mode which gain XP and level up from kills made in multiplayer, even if an enemy kills some wildlife, although i havn't played much of PvP so i woulden't know too much about it.There are two kinds of maps in freemode and campaign, there are what are called ""RPG"" maps which it's just your avatar(s) but even though it says RPG there is still a little RTS in it since you can use other Rune Warriors as i mentioned above up to 5 although they don't level up with you, so you have to do a bit of swapping out for higher level runes, which can be annoying especially when you have to ditch one of your favourite runes for a higher level one.The second type is the ""Standard"" version which you get shrines (similar to the Hero shrine you summon your Rune Warriors with) to train units, there are 6 types of shrines each with their own slave rune which again doesn't level with your avatar but you find slaves every few levels, there are Humans, Elves, Dwarves for good and Dark Elves, Trolls and Orcs for evil each has different uses for the ""standard"" resources and uses one of the three ""unique"" resources, although some of the factions like Dark Elves will use more than one special or standard resource type with their structures, even very basic structures like the woodcutter's house.When leveling up you get 2 skill points and 5 or 10 attribute points, after creating your character you can unlock up to 8 more skills and skill sets, each skill set requires a different attribute level to be reached (the attribute that you have to level is different for each skill and most to all of them require more than one attribute to be leveled) skills can't be leveled higher than the skill set they are in, be careful what you spend your points on though because if you mess up you can't get your stats or skills back.If you don't like controlling your units like an RTS, don't worry you can take direct control of your Avatar although it is fairly clunky and selecting units can be a pain especially since you can still select your avatar in this mode, and attacking is annoying too, when selecting things there will be icons at the top left bellow your heroes icons showing what they can do, and the icon shows how far away they are from the target, you can also assign control groups to units but that probably won't matter much since you won't be splitting your troops up as much because of the fairly restrictive population cap, and when you do it will be because you are leaving a few troops behind to help defend your base.In campaign enemies can drop loot from quest items to random jumk you can sell, but in free game mode and multiplayer they don't which is especially bad with Free Game Mode. But there is a dedicated marketplace map which sells a few special rune warriors, possibly every rune slave, a few special blueprints and loads of weapons, armour and rings and possibly every type of spell in the game but the worst part of Free Game Mode is trying to get the cash to buy everything.Co-op in Free Mode is both harder and more rewarding, unless your really good it's best to stick to solo in Free Mode, also the avatar (who represents you in-game) won't automatically attack enemies unless they attack him/her or he/she is ordered to.In general i reccomend getting this if you are an RTS fan or an RPG fan or both this game is a must have.

												A great and one of the few hybrids of RPG & RTS games, this game contains the best of both worlds. The combat system/RTS part doesnt have a Rock-Paper-Scissors combinatiopn of units but a ""throw em all to battle"" type which means the stronger wins and no need for tactics. In the english version of the game (I've played both the german & english version) the voice casting is pretty bad because of small number of actors.Most of the game runs around your avatar, a custom hero which you create (similar to Dungeon Siege & Titan Quest). The campaigns are long (some people complain too long) and gripping offering a weight variety of quests and action in both the RPG and RTS parts of the game. The game also includes a free-game-mode where you can simply play with your avatar and have fun. The game has also tons of equipment, spells & weapons just like every RPG should. One of the best parts of the game is the skill tree which is very simple to understand but offers a weight choice for your character evolution. Some/many may experience the CD not working requiring it to be inserted every time you start the game but it can be fixed without any problems (You have many ""how to fix"" guides in the Steam Community) The game may also have some bugs, but I haven't had any problems. It says the game is NOT compatible with Windows 7 but it works well for me (I guess i'm lucky). I would recommend this game to any RPG/RTS player, but would advise to wait till their prices drop a little during a sale. You won't be disapointed in this game+ Good hybrid (best of both worlds)+ Story & quests+ Lots of gear+ Gameplay+ Character creation & evolution+ Free-Game-Mode- Poor voice cast- CD-key problem (CAN be fixed)- No real tactics- Unfortunately not compatible for modern Windowses			"

												I wanted to like this game. I really did. It really tried to touch that hybrid frontier of RPG/RTS. I got the Platinum edition on sale, and dove in. Little did i know the hole goes to China. 90% of the time, i prefer long games, makes the experience lasting and fun to view in scope. However, games that i tend to enjoy that last upwards 100 hours usually have meat in them, every minute is either action packed or planning. This game is not one of those games. I dont know how many collective hours i spent READING A BOOK while waiting for characters to travel across the map because of poor quest design and placements of locations. Sadly there is no speed adjustment, and each map you play on can last upwards 3-4 hours, which really emphasizes placing content in the map itself, whereas  you forget a chest that might have something nice inside, you have a 8 minute jog all the way back to it, and then another 8 minutes back to a bindstone or portal. The bindstones are your only salvation to get across some of these huge maps with empty space, but even then they are few and far between. I beat the main campaign lasted about 70 hours, got into the 2nd campaign and almost got to the end. Game crashed, and after getting back in found that the autosave feature apparently decided that 4 hours worth of gameplay wasnt worth saving in between. Ive given up, especially knowing that there are many other games out there that want attention. This isnt some Grand Strategy game that requires patience, its an RTS that either moves too slow or has maps way too big. Maybe when i have nothing else, I'll come back to finish, but 100 hours of the SAME BORING GRIND and all i really want to do is just move on. Spellforce, take a few lessons from Warcraft 3. If your gonna make big maps to trudge around, make them interesting.			"

												You should buy this! This game is a hybrid RPG/RTS and the developers did an awesome job blending the two genres. The RPG aspect feels like Neverwinter Nights or Dungeon Siege, while the RTS side feels like Age of Empires. The game balances the two sides well and the setting is really quite neat. Also, hats off to the soundtrack, this game's music adds a pleasent level of immersion and feel.			"

Even though I never finished the game back then (I am on the brink of finishing it now..maybe) I would still play the ♥♥♥♥ out of it, doing whatever I could, killing whatever monsters I could find and finishing whatever quests I could get.The RTS part of the game binds very well as well making the story even better.Even though it's an old game and the graphics might not be top notch, it's a must have, for the gameplay and for the story.Damn good game.

												I have played this game a lot in my childhood and have recently come back to it, I was surprised how good this game still is despite how much time has passed. This game has certainly aged well and I will happily nominate it to the ""TEST OF TIME"" award.Pros:-Great combination of rts/rpg-Tons of gameplay even if you rush everything-Comes with an extra seperate story, and a story that is a continuation and combination of the other two.-Hero customization options allow you to play whatever you want, even multiclassing which gives it high replayability.-Interesting story and lore-6 different playable races of minions-Online play and skirmish vs ai-Voice acting for every line-Many  different spells to use and many more in the expansionsCons:-Can not use your custom character outside the story (not much of a con but should be mentioned)-An old game with graphics to match but still good for its time.-Some of the voice acting is bad (but in a funny way)-Some things may get repetitiveOverall i'd say this game is definitely worth the money you spend on it and if you give it a shot you'll most likely really enjoy yourself like i did.

												This game might very well have defined my childhood and forever formed what I expect of an RPG, along with classics like Divine Divinity and Neverwinter Nights. Back when patches were got from magazines and expansion packs actually meant something, this was up there for me. I still play it when I want a hit of nostalgia or when all I have with me is my laptop that can't run high-performance games. And that's on modern hardware, back in the day it was gorgeous and demanding to the point that my old PC had to rest for half an hour before I could do anything else. Good times.I have a combined 500+ hours in this for sure and only bought it on Steam for easy availability.Before I go to a TL;DR pros & cons list (see below), here's my opinion:You're the classic hero, a chosen one to rid the world of an evil scourge. There's not much to it until you think about the twist: a warrior stored in a rune, an immortal and special little snowflake whose tales have survived an apocalypse. You're not a commoner witnessing an event and moving to arms, you're not a soldier rising through the ranks, not an arbitrary divine pick. You're always meant to become the hero of the story because you were a hero in wars before.With this, you've also arrived at the hook that keeps the game rolling. You can't die, you can't exactly lose. When you fall, you resurrect at a bindstone. But that doesn't make the game easy - it takes thought and some strategy and a number of fights are an honest challenge if you're not prepared as a character or have stacked up an army to support. That said, if you like the thrill of perma-death or the prospect of immense consequences to a lost fight, this might not be for you. It's a heroic epic with you in the centre and only very few things can go horribly, game-breakingly wrong. 'twas a different era, after all.Have some fun with it, don't take it too seriously, but enjoy the story. It's got wit, it's got snark and if you play games for their stories, you won't be disappointed.Back in the day, gameplay was a bit buggy. As the kid I was I didn't understand what that meant, but none of the ones I encountered were game-breaking, perhaps mildy infuriating at worst. The latest versions have got rid of most of the bugs I remember and if there are any left, I haven't found them.With that out of the way, SpellForce managed to balance RTS and RPG quite well for being one of the innovators. You had many ways to accomplish your quests, from sneaking around with your hero party to building up an army to steamroller the whole map. Of course you could easily exploit a near-infinite time window to fortify, gather resources and power-up your army to the max, but it's up to you to limit yourself for more of a challenge or if you'd rather build an epic army to impress your foes and allies alike. Minmaxers will find this game very easy, be aware of that.Character progression was great. Your skills meant something and there wasn't a single specific progression that would eclipse all others, they all had their ways to shine. Just like you'd expect, you could be the tanky warrior going balls-deep into action or you could be a kitey wizard ranger and nuke from a distance. All viable, all great. But you can also branch out too much, wide as the ocean, deep as a puddle and so on.Note: Melee classes have a bit of an upper hand here. They're not terribly OP, but mages do have to rely on support to shine. Once you get rune warriors, the above still stands, though.Different races have different strengths in the RTS part of it all, but most often the game has picked what you have for you and the rare times you do get to make your own choice between, say, elves and orcs, it doesn't really matter. Mostly you'll find them all equally supportive and they all can overrun your foes if you want them to. Not much to say here, but you'll find yourself having a knack for one or the other at some point.The RTS part was a bit cumbersome, overly shiny and maybe not quite thought-through. Its flaws notwithstanding, it's still a great asset and an integral part of the game and you can relax and have your mind off of things for a while when building a base. (SpellForce 2 got this part just right, it's far better in this aspect, but it's different enough to warrant a separate review.)Quests.There are a lot of them.You'd expect to find a lot of fetch-and-kill quests, and you'd be right, but they're still... different. You often can't just take the quest, walk a few paces, pick up a thing and come back. More often than not you'll find yourself making a note in your journal to keep an eye out for a thing on your travels, at some point forget about it or get really frustrated because you just can't bloody get it. But then, just as you tossed that quest out your imaginary window, you find that thing. You're overjoyed and soonest you can, make your way back to the quest-giver five-or-more isles back. At their core, these are still simple quests. But they're packaged beautifully in story and nifty mechanics. Many of them are also linked, which is always nice.The stuff that I have the fondest memories of is above. The story is quite dear to me, but I don't want to spoil anyone, so I won't.---TL;DRPros Great story if you give the hero setup the benefit of the doubt Marvellous graphics if you're into nostalgic games Okay balance between RPG and RTS gameplay Balanced character progression Cool quests Excellent humour (some references are from a different era, but oh boy the snark) Great expansions, though the main game is what I mostly refer to hereCons Aged graphics - it might make it hard to immerse yourself if you haven't played it before, but it's still gorgeous Fairly easy - perhaps not a negative, but it's worth saying -, don't expect sweaty palms unless you're reeaally into the story Some of the travelling is a bit tedious, expect to traverse empty plains, especially if you haven't planned your journeys thoroughly Very little choice in which race you build your force with in the RTS aspect - it's always a fitting thematic pick, but you don't get to make it---Give SpellForce a try, if you're into the good old days of RPG, you won't regret it. SpellForce 2 is also excellent, but different enough to advise not to expect the same thing. It's also considerably newer, so graphics aren't as out of touch as the first instalment.Edit: Also a thing to keep in mind, the multiplayer is dead. It was underpopulated when it was still a thing, but obviously nowadays this is to be taken as a sole SP game. I only ever once played MP with a mate - it was a solid experience, but not much else.Cheers. "

												This game is like a singleplayer version of World of Warcraft combined with Age of Empires and a little Lord of the Rings.It's a fun game. The controls are a bit clumsy and the units AI is pretty... pretty not pretty, it sucks. For example the healers heal the wounded unit even if the unit is missing 1hp. You may think that's good, but it's not. Healing uses mana and has a cooldown.			"

												The acme of the RTS/RPG genres mix, the absolute best game of its class, still unbeaten even today, Spellforce is a one-in-a-lifetime experience which shows you just how games of this type should be made. Not only are both RPG and RTS elements equal and provide unique game experience, but also the players can give their preference to any one of them and play the game as if it were a full-fledged RPG or RTS. Lead your armies into battles... or defeat the enemy single-handedly with the help of a squad of chosen heroes. Forget about Spellforce 2, buy THIS!			"

												RPGS and RTS games are two of my favorite game genres, and combining the two was like a dream come true when i first played this game as a kid, and after all these years this game still stands as one of my Top 10 Games of all time.+Class Customization:This is the reason why this game skyrockets up my favorite games list, theres so many ways you can build your character in this game its insane. And with the ammount of weapons and spells there is in Spellforce no matter how many times you play this game every playthrough feels diffrent.Gameplay:While it's RTS elements isn't the best i'v seen its still very unique, all the races feel diffrentand have diffrent strengths and weaknesses.The in the beginning of the game where the RTS element comes it might seem very simple but halfway through the game some maps get really complicated and you have to use your resources well and really have a plan.Story:The Story while it's not really one of the games best traits its still fairly good and keeps you fairly intrested in whats going on(for the most part) and there's definently some suprises here and there.Soundtrack:While its not the best iv heard this game has a great soundtrack and fits very well with the situationfrom a peaceful walk on Icy Mountains to a large and epic battle.Lengthy:Like i mentioned before there is so many ways you can build your character and that alone gives lots of replay value.But the game itself is also long, 3 campaigns(Of which the Original Order of Dawn Campaign alone takes a while to complete), loads of sidequests to keep you busy and like i mentioned before some of the later maps get complicated and can take you a really long time to finish.-The Voice acting in this game is hit or miss...ish, most of it is okay but some of the voice actorsjust sound bored or not intrested in general.This game can get really repedetive at times, it takes a while to set up your base and sometimesjust trying to walk from A to B feels like it takes all day.And while i enjoy the most quests in this game some of them will have you wander around multiple maps for hours.(Warning: Kinda Long Angry Rant Ahead)While i love the Character Customization in this game and i especally love playing a mage in this game because of all the things you can do with your mage and how many spells there are.What i DON'T like is the fact that you have to find about 90% of the spells yourself. The fact that you have to find them isn't what bothers me( i like it when a game makes you work for your stuff rather than ""Spoonfeeding"" it to you), what bothers is that most of the spells are dropped randomly from monsters or found in chests.It also doesn't help that sooner or later a spell will become useless and you will have to find a higherlevel of the spell and sometimes the game might decide to ♥♥♥♥ with you and never give you the spell.(Long Story short playing a Mage in this game is really fun ONCE you find the spells you want)Final Verdict:10/10This is one of those games i can play dozens of times and never get tried of, iv never seen a game whichcombines and RTS and an RPG so well and at the same time have some of the best character customizationiv ever seen.This game very well worth the money.

												Spellforce is one of a underrated game, it's similar to Baldur's Gate, Titan Quest and Dungeon Siege.The gameplay is great for a game of its time, you can have 2 different type of camera, one which is from top (like Titan Quest) where you control your character(s) and give them orders and the other one which is behind your character where you'll play him.You can have workers and build buildings which you cannot In Dungeon Siege, Titan Quest or even Baldur's Gate, It's original and really great.The game is really great, there is even a free game mode where the replay ability is unlimited.You can also create your maps which can make the game even more awesome.I'd suggest it to any RPG, Dungeon Siege, Baldur's Gate and Titan Quest (of course, there are a lot more but those are just 3 examples of games similar to this one) fans.9/10			"

												What a game. Base game plus expansions. This was truly a unique experience, but not without its own issues. Graphics: For it's time it was probably great, and does kind of look good even today by some minor twaking and an unofficial patche which enables widescreen and HD resolution. The animation does look stiff and when interacting with characters there's nothing but body language to be seen. Sound: Also for it's time it was probably great. Now not so much. VA was horrible to listen to. At times I just wanted to mute the sound and hide behind a pillow to avoid the VA. The music however was great, filled with atmosphere, and background sounds really added to the atmosphere as well. Making each map feeling alive, or haunted. When fighting against enemy forces there was a clear sound of blades hitting other blades but that was about it. No unique sound for other weapon types except bows and crossbows. UI: A little rough. Slightly confusing in the beginning, but easy to understand. Inventory management lacks features we are used to knowadays with tabs and sort functions. Each tab has its own function: Gear, Magic, Runestones/Herostones, Plans(units and buildings) and Quest items. The map shows precise locations of units and buildings. Selecting a unit to choose what to build can be a mess, but with proper management of plans this will be a breeze. The same for unit plans. Gameplay: This is the games strongest point. Awesome combination of RTS and RPG. * RPG: This is controlled through 3rd person view. You use the WASD keys for movement, and select spells using your mouse. Maybe even using the numbers above WASD. From this perspective you can control your summoned units and titans, open chests, complete quests etc. There are however no option for jump, but seeing as this is a RTS title it is understandable. As you level your hero you can allocate skillpoints to a skilltree, either for melee or magic. * RTS: The easy part of the game. Select a worker, then a building and let the worker along with 4 other buddies build it. Then you can upgrade certain units with new spells or powerful gear. Each monument which has one unique for each ""faction"" acts as a barracks from which you can summon new units. Like most RTS games before it it too has base defense buildings. Weak on their own, but combined with certain units can be a lethal combination that can tear enemy troops apart. Eventually you can summon titans, achieve greater power for other units and with one faction even upgrade the stats of the buildings. What annoyed me is that ranged units had to move right next to enemy buildings to destroy it. Made it feel weird, especially among the magic only units.  * Maps: The maps are huge. At times it feels too huge as it takes awhile to reach the enemy camps or objective on the other side of the map. Most of the time it works fine, but other time it simply makes the game feel slow. The maps are both the games weakness and strength because of it. I found many maps often boring as most areas didn't really feel unique. Resources on some maps are scarce as it should be. Maps provides strategic places for defense as well as offense with varied terrain. Story: I loved it at first. A lone Runewarrior tasked to prevent destruction upon the world as we know it. Help prevent the darkness to win and avoid mass exctinction. Or something along these lines. Not unique, but I liked it. It's not exactly Hollywood quality, and because of horrible VA not exactly engaging either. Cinematics looked and felt great, cutscenes was so so. SummaryWhile the game has alot of content to offer, decent graphics, ok sound, almost-awesome gameplay and an OK-ish story it isn't that great in story. The gameplay felt slow many times and boring. However, I still want to recommend this game. It's unique blend of RPG and RTS is great. Giving me an unforgetable game. While it feels rough around the edges, and even feels like it lack the little extra it is well worth an investetment. If you love RTS and RPG, give it a go. It is a good game, at times even awesome, but as mentioned do have its own issues. Rating: 6 out of 10The negatives pulls the score down, but it still have alot of positives too, some which is hard to explain through words alone and needs to be experienced. So don't let the score scare ya. I still loved the game despite its flaws. In fact, I consider myself a fan. :)			"

												You may be questioning the authenticity of an RPG and RTS mixture, so I'll explain in simple terms;RPG elements used in this game are similar to that of most others, with elves, dragons, trolls and the rest. You can choose and blend from different classes, then use points to improve your character's performance across 6 stats, making customization very flexible. The game has a large leap in difficulty after the first few levels, rewarding the educated players and punishing those who rush through it aimlessly.The RTS (real time strategy) portion of the game makes up a vast amount of the combat. You can build camps for you and your workers, then fund an army with resources and carefully plan out assaults on enemy camps. Much like the Civilization games, it is imperative to protect your camps or you may find yourself tumbling back to the start of the stage and losing everything you've worked for.There are some downsides, such as abusable power and mechanics that limit challenge, but for a player that wants a real tactical adventure, this is near enough the perfect game for it. I played it a lot on it's CD form, so I can honestly say that it does not get boring.			"

												Next to ""Earth 2150"" this game (IMO) is the second best RTS out there. Its unlike your average RTS of just mindless construction and resource gathering. Although the graphics arent super great and the voice acting along with dialouge arent anything special. The game designers have come up with a mix of RPG, storytelling and then RTS. This specific mix keeps me interested in the game and allows a person to sometimes focus on RPG elements rather then hours of hours of mindless RTS'ing. Along with a storyline, (even though its a standard fantasy story) the game at first is easy to play then much later in the  game, it gets much harder. But I found it just the right balance. Not too hard or too easy. Not to mention the many various races one can choose to start RTS'ing for help in defeating the enemy. However, If your character has become powerful enough, in some of the missions your hero along with the other NPC heroes can handle the mission alone without an army of RTS build. A very well thought of mix for this type of genre (RTS) And since this is has 3 games in it, then its 3 times the fun. Worth a buy when on sale			"

												Breath of Winter- there is a very aggravating bug in the Echo Swamps, that prevents you from entering past the second gate to the next dark elf monument. Hortar refuses to talk or move, which ends up stalling the game. Apparently there is no fix to this bug.			"

												this game didnt age well.the voice acting is okay, the 'widescreen support' stretches the display making the already poor graphics even worse, the storyline dull is dull at best but the real drag is the gameplay itself.there is enough content per map to fill around 20 minutes of gameplay. you will however need to play on each map for around 2 hours unless you already know exactly what you need to do and where.your units walk abysmally slow and you constantly need to run all over the map. it could've been saved with a 'fast-forward' feature - for example gametime X10 - but i couldn't find any feature like this. so you constantly wait to get resources or for your units to run into another corner in the map, just to discoverer that this was another dead end with a silly armor as a reward.infuriatingly slow paced.the balance is also all over the place. its mostly pretty easy to conquer everything with a single army. suddenly random and unnamed units pop up that oneshot everything and you need to grind them to death. after them, everything is easy again.classes are unbalanced as well. casters are♥♥♥♥♥♥ melees do roughly thrice the damage and live significantly longer as well. just silly, honestly. don't get me started on that spellbook feature. whoever thought that was a good idea was just madtraining units and building stuff is also completely unnecessarly complicated. at first i thought that i'd have to juggle units and could only chose some from the available pool... but no, you can place any and all buildings you find in your building menu, making this customization completely redundant and tiresome to manage. same with the spells btwthis game was probably fine when it was first released. there wasn't an abundance of games around back then and studios where still trying to figure out basic stuff about games, but nowadays its just annoying to play. ... though checking the release date places it at 2003. Warcraft 3 was released in 2002 and is significantly better.			"

												This isn't a good game... but it's not really a bad game. More a game with some really neat ideas (rts/rpg mashup, multiple build trees ongoing in one build sequence), but a lot of flaws (slow game unit speed, no progress indicators, and a generic plot). Oh and the english localization is kind of all over the place with acting and scripting, which can be kind of amusing in a B-movie sort of way.			"

												Clunky RTS/RPG combo game that isn't very good at doing either. I really thought this would be pretty good. The first person videos are very deceiving and don't really reflect actual gameplay in which you play from a top down perspective. You can play in first person but certainly not as a mage character. If you played this when it came out you could probably enjoy it since you would be used to the terrible controls, graphics and gameplay, but for the newcomer this should be a game you skip. I will be playing spellforce 2 to see if its any improvement. I played through with a black mage and....wow you are slightly more useful than your average troop. Cast times are long in relation to the damage output you do and mana is scarce even when you max the pool and regen. Spell upgrades are not meaningful and most of the time i am just regular attacking to do the same amount of damage with less micromanagement. One of the most annoying things is there is no hot keys for spells.....you must click the spell and click the unit you want to attack or heal. In crowds of 30-50 units this can be VERY annoying. I imagine the game is a little better playing a melee unit with an attack that scales properly.Travel is pretty bad due to large maps and one slow run speed. Takes forever to do the boring fetch quests you are given. Resource gathering is so simple and isn't rewarding in any way. Its barely even a restriction in making units or buildings, just a slight chore at the start. The story is as cliche as it gets and the voice acting is very very bland. Doesn't bother me much, but it is worth noting.			"

												I know that this game is fantastic, as I had played it with CD in the past. That is why I got a new one with a new PC set-up. Unfortunately, the problems of keying-in the code are such that it becomes hopeless to use Steam with this game: no assistance, noBODY to help...I have tested all code configurations (with the strokes, without the strokes, changing ""O"" to ""0""...).

												I had this game on CD and enjoyed playing it as it was a refreshing variation on the RTS genre.   However the company and steam need to work out the CD key issue before this game is playable.   There are 'workarounds' posted on the support section but none of these worked properly for me.   I find it insulting to pay for a game and have to enter a 24 digit code every time I start it.  One of the reasons I buy games on Steam is to get away from annoying CD key issues.  I quit playing the game as soon as I got a bug that stopped me from scrolling the screen using the keyboard and froze up my units. If they fix these issues - then it is worth buying.			"

												I really love ""old"" games. This one looked great at first sight. Combo of RP and Warcraft style strategy. Interesting ways of character development, good amount of units and enemies, nice travelling system, ... and more.Must say it turned out quite boring to me.- many spells are useless, wrong choice ruins the character- the only decent weapon in longer battles are defense towers, so it often turns out to become ""tower defense"", and a matter of patient building rather than some good strategy- story is completely linear - no choices, no suprising events, no depth in the NPCs- ....Could be going on for a while.I liked the concept, but fell asleep from boredom after some hours of repetetive missions without any real story development.

												This game has not aged well. Unless you want to play it because of sentiment or just really want to experience whole Spell Force saga story, move along and play Spell Force 2. Cutscenes are badass <3. I don't remember much of a story (since I've finished it a long time ago), but it should be good. As for everything else... Controls are awful and disorienting. Camera is just weird. And tutorial, which I just went trough is really terrible. On one hand it gives you the most obvious hints in the world (at least five times it reminded me to close my inventory), on the other, it's very not precise in some other commands. Also, sometimes it doesn't acknowledge your progress, so you can easily get stuck. You can skip it, so that's a good thing, but if you never play a game like this...Well, start from a SpellFoce 2. And actually, don't look back.Buy it if:+ you have play SpellForce games before and want to experience them once again+ you're very very curious about this title+ you don't mind awful controlsOtherwise, you can pass on this one.

Sometimes Peanut Butter and Chocolate don't mixI wanted to like this game, I really did. In a way I actually do but I can't quite recommend it to most .  This game seeks to blend the RPG of party based RPGs withe base building and RTS tactics of RTS games. Sadly the execution did not match the lofty goals. The Warlords: Battlecry series (particularly 3) is the closest thing I can liken this game to. So does that mean if you loved Battlecry 3 you'll love this game?  Maybe. personally i would consider it a mix between Dungeon Siege and Battle Realms, with the strong points of neither.First the good.- It is a stable and well thought out game from an aesthetic stand point.- Relaxed pace means it is an easy game to get into and unwind with compared to most RTS gamesAaaaaaand that's all I got. To be fair it is fun at times, but I found it more of a slog than anything else.Now the Bad- The voice acting lacks any energy.- The RTS elements are disappointingly shallow.- The RPG Elements are woefully underdone.- The Story is a bit of a jumble.The voice acting is bad, never mind the small number of VA's buit the all sound like Bill Murray on flu meds. No matter what they say they always sound like they're just about ready to yawn.  It's not even so bad as to be comical it's just dead.THE RTS Elements are the next problem. You pretty much have very little information on your troops, interms of HP, Defense, Damage, etc, not unlike a Westwood style RTS but this is coupled with the abundance of mirror units. That is, while there are different factions, they are for all intents and purposes simply palette swaps. The RPG elements fare no better. In this game, the RPG happens as an aside to the RTS which more or less brings any momentum or tension back down to geriatric ward speed limits. The Story is also a bit of a mess, rather heavy-handed but still generally tolerable thanks to the ability to skip the dreary voice acting.  You won't miss much by skipping the dialog. In the end though the game is not technically bad and it is actually a good sort of RTS game to just relax yourself with. For what it's worth, despite my complaints I still intend to play through the game and it's expacks.Dull, but not so dull as to stop me from playing; just that playing makes me wish i was playing a better game.

												I think I'm spoiled by modern day rts games and rpg games, because by comparison this game isn't very good.  I remember beating the order of dawn's campaign years ago and I remember the game being better than it actually is.  I got halfway through the first campaign before I gave up.  Here's a few of my problems.Translation errors: namely some of the written dialog was in a language I didn't read, like german or swedish or somethingBAD voice actors.  There were a few good ones, but they were few and far between.  The main character's voice was probably the worst of all.  I just turned it off sound after a while.Upgrading units in the store doesn't upgrade units you've already purchased.  And this game has multiple powerful upgrades which you get later on, so you wind up with a bunch of underpowered units.Turrets.  ♥♥♥♥ turrets.  There are a lot of the things in the game and you can only MELEE them down, even units with ranged attacks.  There are no siege units.  And you have to manually and REPEATEDLY  order your units to punch the towers to death because they frequently bug out and start attacking nothing.  An associated problem, there are a limited number of units which can attack a building at a time (thanks to the melee thing) so while the towers are killing your units you have a maybe six or seven of units  out of an army of almost a hundred attacking.And the heroes... o lawd the heroes.  These units don't do anything half the time,letting monsters walk right by and attack your workers.  The other half of the time they'll walk right up to boss enemies and get themselves killed,  instead of using their powerful spells and staying at ranged.  They only autocast a few spells, and not the important spells like Heal so you have to manually instruct them to save your army every. single. time.  A lot of the missions seemed poorly designed, being really difficult one moment only to be followed by an easy level.  I think part of the problem was the transfer between factions was the culprit for this, because the level gives you the usual amount of enemies but only lets you use first-tier units to fight against it.  The designers usually give you access to the last faction's entire tech tree late in the mission (in the form of a Monument to spawn units) to help with this problem.  But by the point that those monuments become available its usually too late to matter, because your army needs to be sufficiently large to hold off attacks on your base AND clear the monument AND defend your resource gatherers, which means your army is probably large enough to just win.Another problem... you know what, I give up.  I have no clue how I managed to beat this game when I was young, but I don't have the patience now.			"

												Spellforce is a mix of RPG and RTS. It's pretty unique for that matter. The only problem is that it fails in both departments.The RPG aspect is as weak as can be. Your character, a rune warrior, is extremely generic. There are little customization options, however, you have a lot of skill options. Be a warrior, a hunter, any sort of mage or priest or something in between. It's up to you. You will gather items, get companions, complete quests and finish off monsters. The way in which you do that, however, is terrible. The quests are for the most part bland, the controls are an abomination and the story and voice acting are atrocious. There are SOME exceptions like South Park's ""chef"" (I think), but he then goes on to voice like 10 different characters -.- so they all sound the same, naturally. Gear is boring. Skills are boring. It's a game from a different era. If you're looking for that, you may find it here, however. Too bad, party based RPG gameplay is only possible on some maps in the campaign.The RTS part is even worse. There are 6 races in the game. In the campaign you will be able to control them all eventually (I'm at race 3 right now), even simultaneously at times. Each race has different units and requires different resources. Humans require wood, stone, iron and arya, elves only wood and leny, dwarves most likely stone, iron and moonsilver, etc. etc. Humans have strong healing warriors, elves have strong ranged units, but weak melee units, etc. Sooner or later resources WILL run out and if you haven't beaten the ""map"" by then...well, bad luck? There is almost no autosave in the game and there aren't really missions. There are only maps and once maps have no more resources left, you might be looking at a restart. Considering the time investment for each map, that is terrible game design.Speaking of terrible game design: Base building is functional, units are ok, but not being able to attack move is a terrible, terrible thing to do. The ""maps"" work in such a way that the enemy has several camps that are ""inert"" at the beginning. Units only spawn once you activate a monument and start building your base. That means, later in the game it definitely makes sense to just kill as many camps with your hero as you can before you ""start"" the mission, because the longer the game goes on, the more units will spawn. It's ridiculous really. This may also be bugged, as I once cleared out a map apart from 1 base, started building my own base and was promptly confronted with around 50 evil Orcs that murdered me...and it gets to that point on almost every map. One map has you fighting through 20 flame spitting towers with CONSTANTLY respawning units. Needless to say the game wastes a lot of time. The maps are big, and even with quick travel it takes a long time to navigate them.That being said you can revisit every map at every point in time (but you will lose all your units and structures you currently have). I'll give them that: the game is huge. You're looking at 30 hours I guess. At least. And I'm playing on easy. My hope is that my character will slowly get to that point where he can solo solve most issues though :)I'm hating a bit on the game. It's old, obviously. Times were different back then and you can still get enjoyment out of it, but I doubt many players will still be able to put up with all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that gets thrown your way.			"

												Spellforce is a game which combines Role-playing elements with real-time strategy. One hand you have a certain character which represents you and on the other hand you can control an army of up to 80 soldiers which you have recruited using resources gathered from the map. The player creates a character at the beginning of the game. This character can acquire skills and spells and gain experience from completed quests and vanquished enemies. Items can be bought from shops, looted from enemies or found in chests in the different maps which can then be used to kit out the player character according to the skills the character possesses. The player also acquires runes which lets the player summon additional characters to assist on some maps and as well as let the player summon in workers which constructs buildings and harvest resources. During the game you also pick up recipes and blueprints which will allow you to create new units and construct new buildings.The scope of the game is vast. The main campaign may require more than 50 hours to complete if you intend to pursue side quests. You have the ability to summon armies composed of six different races (Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Trolls and Dark elves) which each have 9 different units at their disposal. Each race has its own buildings and require different resources. The game features a story line with many side-quests available.  Sadly, the game suffers from a myriad of issues. By trying to be too much the game fails at almost everything. First, the game looks extremely dated. The graphics which might have been impressive in 2006 look really hideous today. Other contemporary games such as Warcraft 3 have fared much better. The gameplay is a mess. The ambitious design to combine RTS and RPG elements have resulted in a situation where neither of the systems are particularly satisfying. The RPG part has perhaps been fleshed out more but it never really feels rewarding. The strategy side is a total mess. Your only tactic is essentially to mass powerful units and try to send them toward the enemy in some fashion. Most units if not directly controlled will charge to attack the nearest enemy they can see which causes them to run into enemy encampments and chaos ensues. Trying to micro-control your units in combat is almost futile and if your attack fails, you might just as well just get a new troop of units and try again.Combat is unsatisfying. You can see how much damage you do to enemies and how much they do to you but you are never given the information how much health, mana, skills, spells or speed they might possess. The lack of information makes it hard to determine how effective units are, Your recruitable units are also very similar. Each race has a basic melee unit, basic archer, magic user. Then more effective melee user and archer and so on. The magic users with their different spells are the most varied. Every other unit just feels like their models got changed and nothing else.Your enemies will never build structures or gather resources. Instead they are spread out across in the map in pre-build encampments. As long as their buildings stand, new units will get spawned in which will attack your camp. By razing their buildings the spawn points disappear. It's a simple solution but also rather boring. The difficulty of the maps are mostly based on how fast new units spawn and attack. Whenever spawning isn't used the map is usually littered with non-consequential enemies which you have to grind through.The game is very slow. Your units and character run at predetermined speeds and often you have to run great distances and criss-cross over a map to finish off all objectives which, frankly, takes ages. Building up your base also takes time and you always have to build the base from scratch on new maps. Acquiring the required resources to produce the necessary units is also a slow process and often I found myself stepping away from the computer and doing chores instead of playing the game. The slow running speeds combined with the dull base-building artificially prolongs the length of the game. By the end I was bored out of my skull, frustrated from assorted bugs and barely managed to muster enough effort complete the main campaign.I can only with good conscience recommend this game to rpg/rts fans who have a lot of free time on their hands and don't mind lackluster mechanics. Anyone else should avoid Spellforce. Spellforce was purchased based on incorrect teenage nostalgia and a heavily reduced price.			"

												tl;dr: Don't get this game.I got this game a while back, about two years ago or so, as part of the Steam Summer Sale of that year. It was advertised as a hybrid RPG/RTS game, and since those are my two favorite genres, I thought it was a good deal. Boy, was I wrong. It turns out that when you try to serve two masters at once, you end up serving neither. This isn't a hybrid RPG/RTS game; it's a mediocre RPG duct taped to a mediocre RTS, resulting in a very boring a repetitive gameplay. Spellcasters in particular are annoying to level up, as you have to collect a spell once at its minimum level and for each level above it. The various stat requirements for combat and magic skills also punishes you for trying to be creative, as choosing skills with mismatched stat requirements will result in you never reaching the maximum level for one or both skills. Graphics-wise, it has not aged well, as it dates to the time when 3D acceleration was in its infancy, and the graphics look primitive compared to its contemporary 2D or hybrid 2D/3D games. As for the audio, the voice acting is inconsistent. Some of the voice acting is professional, though done by voice actors who aren't native English speakers, which adds a dash of the exotic to the involved characters. The rest is terrible and amateurish, and ruins immersion when heard alongside the decent voice acting.			"

												RTS + RPG but not a very smooth transition between the two. Most of the RTS components are resource gathering and army upgrade structures while most of the RPG is popping abilties whenever they come off cooldown and equipping a paperdoll. You can get more Hero units to equip and micromanage skills but only your main levels up. Classes are really narrow and if you are unlucky with drops (main town near the beginning only sells low & high level overpriced trash) you will be stuck with a one trick pony who is weaker than your cannon fodder troops. In short, this game tries to do too many things and is not greater than the sum of its parts.			"

												I love this game, played it for over 100 hours (estimated) and got it on steam additionally. That's why it shows different here.SpellForce is an ""older"" game and you can definitly see that, nontheless the gameplay, mechanics, story and just everything else is great! Even if you finish the first campaign, you can restart with a completely different hero and a wjole new experience. On some maps there is a short moment of annoyance for reasons of resources or map design but that is really minor.			"

												A detailed world and intuitive, but simple RPG /  RTS hybrid, the Spellforce games combine the genres focussing on fun playing rather than number-crunching. As such, it's lacking challenge in parts but overall makes for a great experience. Although the storyline is linear there's plenty of side-quests and huge variety of character specialisations also some inventive plot twists!			"

												Okay, this one is kind of weird. But rather fun and addictive. Best way I can think to describe it is if you took Diablo, added in your standard party based format from RPGs, then blended it with a RTS game. That's not exact. But it might give an idea. Sometimes you're controlling your character (maybe) via  3rd person camera and standard wasd movement controls. More often you're using an isometric top down view and clicking on where you want your character(s) to move to or what you want them to attack. And other times you're building a base camp, fortifying it against attackers, and then building an attack force like you're playing your favorite real time stratagy game.The storyline so far is rather interesting. The controls are intuitive. If you've played any RTS games you're going to master the controls easily. And while the stratagies aren't very complex, mostly you're just building up a good sized attack force and steam rolling everything in your way, that's kind of true for most RTS games. There's very few in the genre where a stratagy beyond ""create 30 of X type of unit then blitz the enemy"" is needed.			"

												Hands down one of the best games I've ever played. The Germand developers at Phenomic have done an amazing job at combining RTS with RPG elements, and wrapping it into a gripping plot. The great immersion is definitely one of the big pluses of this game. Phenomic created a unique and captivating lore that makes you wanna know all there is about the world of Fiara, its origin, its races, basically it makes you wanna dive into this fascinating world of that has everything a good fantasy lore needs. Pros- long and epic campaign- challenging difficulty- combines RTS with RPG- truly awesom lore- complete freedom in spec type- you can play it several times (with different specs), doesn't get boring Cons- English voice actors suck (if you speak German, get the German version!!!!)- it's an old game, meaning the game doesn't take you by the hand and explains everything- base builing can take its time - can't delete skills/respecctips- browse the official forums for useful character builds, so that you don't end up with a messed up build			"

												Spellforce, it's my childhood game. I have good memories with this game. Played it like about... 300 maybe more hours in total (not on steam version just bought it like 2 weeks ago or something) Main quest is not really that ""wow"" thing but it's kinda interesting like ""what is going on right now? I want to know why it's happening!"" game is classic, i don't think graphics are so important but if we talk about that... for the time when the game was released... it's just perfect. Gameplay? Sure it's nice, building you're kinda camp/town and then your army or army can be first too just what suits you (Need some buildings for it first tho to get basic fighters) Resources are a tough thing in the first hour of the game, it's kinda slow and the waiting for food to expand your army.. i think if u take your time and like to build some nice towns like me you will need like 3-5hours at one map! Seriously, and we are not even talking about side quests! Some quests are really hard, some are easy as hell - > just destroy them do that and that done. But sometimes you just get tough enemies. Game has 6 races 3 light and 3 dark (sides). Further and further u will get all of them but there aren't so many missions where u can use more than 1-2 races so it's slowly. Favorite race? Jesus, Elfs for sure, bows, healers, ice magic enemy doesn't have a live anymore, freeze them. Cons? After some time it begins to be little boring, walking from end of the map just to click on a grave stone fight a 12 level man when u are 15 already.. isn't fun, mostly it's the same story -> Build army and destroy enemy. But i really recommend this game i bought this already 3 times.. first was just classic game second platinum too but lost cd so i thought i just buy it on steam when it was on sale, totally worth even when it isn't you will have fun i promise!

												I tried to play this when it first came out and I loved it.  But the mouse was overly sensitive and I could not navigate the game.  So I quit.  Steam had a sale so I tried it again.  The mouse is fixed!!After 110 hours, I finally beat this game on easy.  And easy was very hard.  It's a perfect blend of RTS and RPG.  However, do not play a mage, wizard, magic user, or whatever you call a character with magic.  ""Spellforce"" is a misnomer.  There are not many spells here.  But there are A LOT of strong weapons and equipment for fighter.  Also, save and save a lot.  Kill one monster...save.  Turn a corner...save.The voice acting sucked.  I laffed at it most of the time.  However,  the story is good.  There was an unexpected twist at the end which I enjoyed.  Now I have two expansions go get through.  If you have 110 hours...buy it.

One of my top 5 favorite games of all time! The Good: The Game is incredibly long and detailed. Maps and mobs are varied and colorful. Lots of skills and spells. If I would compare it to any other, more well known, game it would be Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War (campaign mode). But with stronger RPG element,  character building, loot and, of course, a fantasy setting.The Bad: The game can be quite buggy (like most JoWood games). Make sure you keep multiple saves over the course of your game as game breaking bugs can pop up and the only fix is to back up several hours. Also, multi-player is rather poorly implemented and hard to get to run at all.Replay value is ok. The base game has one (very long) campaign and it doesn't change much from playthough to playthrough. The variation comes from how you chose to build your character. I have not completed the expansion campaigns but they seems a lot harder.			"

												While this may be considered an old school RTS game to several, Spellforce Platinum gives you quite a bit to think about while carefully manuvering about the battlefield. You will also find your self switching back and forth between a rpg party style of tactics along with base building ones. Ontop of that you get to see the story, setting, and quite a bit of character development as you go about on the campaigns. You're even able to customize what role your character will be; weither it's a tank like warrior, a fiercesome warrior, mage, healer, or even a hybrid like build. Adding in open rpg option allows you to go about by your self or with friends in a co-op adventure. There's no need to worry about loot because if one persion picks it up from a chest or dead enemy while in a coop open rpg map, all members in the party acquire the same item. Also the reasources gathered on any map will regenerate over time, wood taking the most to come back.			"

												I've been playing this game since WAY before I got steam and thanks to the online community it never really feels outdated. The sequels are not bad, but they didn't live up to first one. It is also one of the few games which allows you to go on an entirely new adventure with the same character you used to complete another story thanks to the add-ons (from 'Order of Dawn' or 'Breath of Winter', to 'Shadow of the Phoenix).Spellforce's RPG/RTS combination is one of the best I've seen in the games I've played but I must admit, the RPG element only holds true to the choice in skills and abilities, not so much in choice in what kind of personality your hero has. I mean, there are certain times where you can make moral choices, but because they have little influence on the eventual outcome of the game, you'll probably just choose the one with the best reward.Lastly, the game has a few bugs, and to finish the first two parts (either 'Order of Dawn' or 'Breath of Winter') on an adequate level can really time consuming if you do use the modded maps created by the online community (which can sometimes can even give you the opposite problem).

												I can't speak highly enough about this game. I played it from it's release and it has given me a lot of joy over the years. I think everyone has that one game they played when they were younger that they can always enjoy. SpellForce is that for me. I wish they could have made more campaigns.It is the perfect mix between RTS and RPG. I've spent many hours replaying these first three games over and over because I just can't get enough. The storyline is amazing, the visuals (for its time) are beautiful, and the gameplay is perfect. I will always consider this as my favourite game of all time. I have tried the second games but they just don't have the same feel. Plus the models looked weird and the amount of bugs made it unplayable for me. But these first games are just perfection. It has such an in depth world and many side quests and stories for you to follow. I don't ever get bored. The music alone gives it a special, almost eerie feel. I get all nostalgic and goose bump-y when I see a screenshot or hear some of the music. My favourite song is Cenwen Song from A Breath of Winter.To put it simply, I would reccommend this game to anyone who wants a lot of fun and adventure. I love it so much.			"

												I bought this game when I was a kid because the artwork on the box looked so cool; I still enjoy playing it. I like the explorative aspect combined with the building and fighting aspects. This would look excellent remastered with better graphics. It's a little more involved than say... age of empires, due to the interesting plot twists and character customization. The enemy is quite difficult to beat at times especially when the resources at your disposal are scarce.You get to level up your heroes and select their abilities as well as the weapons and armour they wear. You build temporary villages to increase your power and fight the awaiting hordes of creatures spawned from the backwaters of hell. Play with elves, humans, dwarves... Although the game in general is linier there are many side quests and areas to explore and you can always go back through the map to catch anything you missed. "

												I am really enjoying this one, a bit more basic then the SF 2 games but still a lot of fun and worth the summer sale price.2 things. Insert code - and repeat every time you play and the option button in game crashes your game. Fixes:When you go to play Spellforce Platinum go to your steam library/spellforce platinum/launch options and type in -window then go to your c:/program files/steam/steamapps/common/spellforce platinum/spellforce.exe and right click for properties and set it to run as admin. then play the game through steam ..open options in the windowed screen, set your prefered options then close the game and go back to the steam/SFP/properties/launch options and take out the -window.  You can now play the game without having to worry about putting in the code every time and on the settings you want. DO NOT use the option button unless your in -window mode or it will just crash your game as soon as you touch it.			"

												Time-eater. You can't tell by how much time I played on Steam, but I've wasted so many hours with this game when I had it on CD. Graphics aren't 3D 4K with 1080p70 and characters never change their mimics, they don't even open their mouth when they speak, but it's not the graphic we are here for. It's the game itself. The gameplay. It's up to you if you want to waste your time in one of the time-consuming stories or making your 'level 1' character and exploring each map from lvl 1 to 50. And the progress isn't the fastest. It's pleasantly average and slower with each level up.When it comes to storyline it's hours and hours of making main and side quests. Going from one location to another. Killing, slashing, exploring, talking, expanding, looting...			"

But I finally risked it and got this sweet edition.And it works without any trouble. I had to change no single setting. It started started itself, installed and was done.So if you are also not sure if you want to risk it and you are scared that it would not run on your computer...It did for me. I can't promise for you, but it is worth it. The game itself is that mix of RPG and Strategy that I always wanted and I am very happy to be able to play it again. Yes, there is Spellforce 2, but it's not the same without the Runes :P			"

												I really have mixed feelings about this game.  Overall, it's an amazing game and I really enjoyed playing it.  The problem was after about 6 hours of playing, my save file corrupted which resulted in me having to start over.  Started over a second time and after about 7 hours the save file corrupted again.  After the second time of losing my save game I said screw it i'm done.  Perhaps I'm unlucky (and with all the great reviews maybe I am), but I have hundreds of steam games and this is perhaps the second time I've had problems like this in many years of using steam.			"

												I put 150 hours into this game according to Xfire way back in 2004. It is total cheeseball fantasy at its finest. Shameless Tolkien worship, excessive boob armor, and more fairy fanart than you can find on all of Tumblr combined. It's not a deep game, the RPG systems are unbalanced and half-baked, the RTS systems are shallow and clunky, and the game as a whole, despite its grand production values and sensational soundtrack lacks, is buggy and weird. But it is insanely fun because of the sincerity with which the developers deliver this experience. If you dig Warcraft 2 and the Dungeon Siege games then you will probably dig Spellforce as well. Also the sequel is pretty solid, too.			"

												I've been playing this game since WAY before I got steam and thanks to the online community it never really feels outdated. The sequels are not bad, but they didn't live up to first one. It is also one of the few games which allows you to go on an entirely new adventure with the same character you used to complete another story thanks to the add-ons (from 'Order of Dawn' or 'Breath of Winter', to 'Shadow of the Phoenix).Spellforce's RPG/RTS combination is one of the best I've seen in the games I've played but I must admit, the RPG element only holds true to the choice in skills and abilities, not so much in choice in what kind of personality your hero has. I mean, there are certain times where you can make moral choices, but because they have little influence on the eventual outcome of the game, you'll probably just choose the one with the best reward.Lastly, the game has a few bugs, and to finish the first two parts (either 'Order of Dawn' or 'Breath of Winter') on an adequate level can really time consuming if you do use the modded maps created by the online community (which can sometimes can even give you the opposite problem).

												Breath of nostalgia, could have been the turning point in RTS and RPG gaming if W3 wasn't able to work with the idea better and developer had more money and support. Mostly lost and forgotten game but not for those who know and remember :). One of the first RTS and RPG hybrid, but I think the FIRST one actually playable. (There are actually earlier but for me unplayable). You control your Avatar as your hero plus an army of fantasy races (Dwarves, Elves, Trolls....). Gameplay is sweet and simple but lengthy (most of the time victory on the map is assured but nevertheless will take quite some time to accomplish it). World is divided into islands (maps) and you move within them by portals. Could be actually slightly considered open world because game doesn't restrict you to actual location, but the freedom of the movement is not utilized except few quests where you have to go back to specific locations. Mostly you will move forward to new locations and never look back.RPG system is classic. Xp gained by killed creatures and completed quests. There are actual some mathematical modifications for gaining xp, such as killing one monster too many times cause you to permanently gain less xp for that monster, but except that, it is pretty straight and simple xp system. For every level you recieve two ability points. There are primary (Heavy Combat Arts, Elemental Magic, Mind magic...) and secondary, which derives from the primary ability (Heavy Combat Arts ->> Heavy Armor or Two Handed Swords). You can select any of the abilities, making you capable of doing any type of hero you want, you can pick Black and White magic at the same time or Heavy and Light Combat Arts simultaneosly. Before upgrading secondary you need to have primary at least on the same level (You level the abilities, you pick the ability and it is on lvl 1, and then you can upgrade to 2,3....). You can pick an ability only if you have sufficient stat for that ability (Example: For Heavy Combat Arts lvl 3 you need 38 strenght). For every level you recieve 5 stat points and can be distributed freely. Leveling system that doesn't restrict you by a skill tree or a class is actually dangerous in this game. You can find yourself in the middle of the gameplay realising you screwed up and picked useless abilities and you cannot undo it. So character grinding thumbs down.Abilities are unbalanced, cool looking magic school is actually useless. Game favors fighters! You can play a mage, but you will have harder time.Equipment for your hero is designed the old-fashioned way. Enemies drop items, you equip them, higher lvl monsters drops higher lvl items, you know that thing... Quest rewards etc...Game is unique (as far as I know) in the rune system. Well, you are actually the Rune Warrior. You gain runes from loot and quests, and those runes represent for example a hero. Heroes that aid you in your quest needs to be ""dropped"". With the army runes it is the same. For example you drop Elven rune lvl 5. Runes can be equiped and when a player finds a monument (same type as it is the rune), it can be activated and the monument can call your rune army, or rune hero. Rune monument is like a main building.RTS system is again simple but I find it fun. You activate the monument (Elf monument with the elf rune), summon the workers, workers mine recources, you build the base, summon the troops (from the monument). Where it gets interesting is that there is 6 types of recources, and some are race specific (Elves don't mine iron for example but harvest ""lenya""). Plans for individual buildings and soldiers needs to be obtained, by loot or quests. Some of them are actually missable which I find idiotic. Troops are well designed, they vary in abilities and are divided into tiers. Races are following: Human, Dwarf, Elf, Orc, Troll, Dark Elf. Playing multiplayer back in the day gave me knowledge that it is heavily unbalanced (Dark Elf and Human are the late game strongest) but I think it is unnoticable in single player. This where the game shines (take into account it is quite old).AI is normal. The engine however doesn't do well with the RTS genre. YOU LITERALLY CAN'T MICRO. Battles are mostly A-move and waiting for the outcome. Graphics, game design, artwork are very very good. Back in the day very few could compete. Story is average with strange outcome but it sucked me in. You can finish the original campaign pretty fast, with the expansions it may take you more. If you can overlook the flaws that haunted older games, it is definitely worth playing, considering on steam it is ridiculously expensive.			"

												Been playing this series since 2004, hooked ever since. If I'd have to say it straight away, buy it. The Platinum edition includes 3 games: SpellForce The Order of Dawn, SpellForce Breath of Winter and SpellForce Shadow of the Phoenix. Each of which can give you 40+ hours of play time.All the points I mention below are are MY personal opinion!!!The story is good, but the games don't have replay value because of it. However, you can(and should) replay it to try out different avatars.The soundtrack is amazing.I like the gameplay, but it's mostly building a base, creating an army and crushing the enemy with power in numbers.You should give this game a try if you like games like Warcraft 3 (to which this series is often compared to!). It's worth well more than the 10€ they ask of you on steam. You can also wait 'till it goes on sale (2-3€). You won't regret it			"

												Bought this game back in 2005, but was too young to fully understand the mechanics. Lost the key and bought it again on Steam. Now, 12 years later I finally managed to get into this great game.Yes, it is flawed, but if you truly give the game a chance, it will win you without doubt - implying you're a fan of RTS as well as RPG games. Spellforce is an RTS game that can turn into an RPG game depending on the map and on the quest you're currently on. However, if you do not enjoy RTS games, you won't have much fun with the RPG parts either, because they're mostly secondary. While you don't need to have any RPG experience to progress in the game, knowing your way around classic RTS mechanics is crucial.The world is really nice and it has this cringy 2000ish fantasy flair with all the ridiculous things such as misleading splash and title screens of women in revealing armor, awkward dialogues with mediocre voice acting and application of even more awkward ""medieval language"" and many more fantasy cliches.The story is not outstanding or remarkable at all, but neither is it bad. The way it is presented makes the whole game pretty immersive and despite being ""not that great"" the story still kinda makes you want to know what happenes next. The world is well designed and there is a lot of exploring to do - RPG-style with your squad of heroes as well as RTS-style with a huge army of buffed out elite soldiers.Speaking of the units in the RTS part of the game: What makes Spellforce really stand out is the player's ability to not only play as different races (dwarfs, humans, elves, dark elves, trolls and orcs), but also play as multiple races simultanously, which sometimes results in some really nice syngery regarding military units and recource management. The game makes is easy to buid up your base fast and spit out tons of units, which makes it clear that the RTS part is heavily focused on battle and military. This does not mean, that you can not build and prosper in peace. Sometimes that is fun too.The RPG part of Spellforce is probably best described as a hybrid of Warcraft 3 and Diablo. A lot of clicking, enemy targeting, item drops, skilling, etc. is to be expected.All in all I really recommend Spellforce to people who enjoyed the classic fantasy setting of games such as Gothic - BUT ONLY if you are comfortable with the RTS genre. If the conditions are met, Spellforce will become one of your favourite games. I hope you check it out and enjoy it.			"

												180 hours later and I am ready to jump into Spellforce 2!  Spellforce is one of those games that I figured I would pick up for next to nothing and maybe dabble for an hour.  It became much, much, more than that.  I figured after going through the game and all of it's expansions on hard (took maybe ~150 hours), I'd write a review.STORY:  7/10 - The story takes awhile to really pick up.  In the beginning, it seems like a typical corny fantasy game about a mage gone bad.  In fact, I fully expected the ending to essentially be the hero catching up to the baddie, killing him, happily ever after.  You'll be in for a surprise and the story only gets better as you go through the expansions.  I REALLY enjoyed the story on the Phoenix expansion.  GAMEPLAY:  9/10 - Really solid RTS with RPG elements mixed in.  You can go into 3rd person mode (which I don't recommend unless looking for hidden loot) and actually jump back to prior stages to complete quests, vendor some loot, etc.  The controls play out really well for having control of up to six ""hero"" type characters. GRAPHICS:  8/10 - Let's be real.  The game came out in 2003 so we're not expecting much in terms of the graphics.  I gave it a higher score due to the look of the world which was generally pretty decent.  The variance in different armors and weapons are pretty cool as well for a game that old.  'Dem load screens.SOUND:  6/10 - If I were judging the music alone... it would be a solid 9.  However, we have to consider the voice-acting which is HORRIBLE for the most part.  If I remember reading this correctly, the game was originally in German and translated to English which likely has a lot to do with it.  Both text and spoken voice are just pretty bad.  If you can look past that, the sound effects are pretty good and the music is solid.FUN: 9/10 - I was having fun the entire time.  Nothing else to say there.  So if you're in the mood for an old-school RTS/RPG with a decent story and plenty of sequel content (as well as Spellforce 3 coming in 2017!), I'd say give it a shot!			"

												This game is crack and it's long. It took me +80 hours to beat the main campaign, and I haven't even touched the 2 expansions. It starts out slow, but after the first 1/5th it really picks up. However, towards the end it takes a real nosedive and starts to be really tedious and frustrating.The RTS parts are the strength of this game. I think the part that makes it so fun is you need to play each level differently. When I first played I was worried I could just cheese my way out of the game by doing the same strategy every level. Not even close. Eventually they start really slanting the levels against you, but in such a way where the race your playing as strengths will cover it. Things you took for granted start being taken away from you, and if you where using them as a crutch then you have to think of something new. This means you have to change up your strategy to beat the levels, which makes the game stay pretty fresh throughout the entire campaign. Easily 80% of the game is amazing because of this, but there are some serious flaws.The RPG parts however are where the game suffers, and honestly, the majority of flaws in the game can be traced to forced role playing elements. Now the part where you customize your character is fun, but the QUESTS (and especially side-quests) are awful. These levels are HUGE. It can take over 5 minutes to cross a map. Now imagine having to backtrack back and forth for quests. There are bindstones to warp around, but they aren't everywhere and you can be wasting a ton of time backtracking just to get some XP for completing a quest. Plus there are sections of the game where it's you and your 5 companions. I never had fun in any of the sections.I blame the forced RPG elements for the game going to♥♥♥♥♥♥at the end. Eventually the game just gives you a quest and starts putting enemies 2x, literally, 2 ♥♥♥♥ing times your units levels against you. You CANNOT even look at the enemy base, you just need to do whatever quest is in the level and get the ♥♥♥♥ out.I'll give one the worst examples (Idk if this one is the worst, theres another one that's a good contender)The riftIt's a really long level in a valley and you just need to get to the other side. There is a spawn for demons about 1/3rd of the way in. There are 3 powerful demons put at choke points with rain of fire spells that rek your army. There is 1 very tanky golem enemy with 1 of them, that doesn't do a ton of damage but tanks for a whlie. Then theres a miniboss at the end.You need to do this level in your first or second push. Your resources are limited and don't respawn, and reloading the level doesn't respawn all of them. Whlie you're out pushing, the demons that spawn will be destroying your base. If you build up your army, the demon waves start getting bigger and bigger (up to 5 or 6 which alone kills your entire army). Not to mention the basic enemy demon has a spell that hits 3 units, and there are 5 of these things. Also the entire time you're out these things will be ravaging your base.Your orcs can't fight these things, they get 2 shotted + aoe magic means your squad will be decimated. If you don't make it to the end with at LEAST a handful of fighters, theres a bossfight at the end and the boss 2 shotted my character with his ranged spells. I could only get through this level by getting 50 ranged enemies to all focus their attacks on one unit at a time  blowing them up while I tanked. You can't do it with a basic army.The rest of the levels, minus the last level, are like this.EDIT:First ExpansionIt starts out REALLY slow. You basically go through this RPG'ish level, relying completely on an NPC to kill everything for you and do story♥♥♥♥♥♥ When you finally do get an army you basically have to cheese it, because you fight a 2 front war WITH NO TOWERS! I don't know why but the expansion removed towers for the first half or so of the game. This makes a lot of levels tedious as ♥♥♥♥. I eventually quit, because I didn't go AFK and grind on one level, which set me 2-3 levels behind the curve and it has been an uphill battle ever since.			"
