												-RUSHING PRIVATE RYAN-We set out in the morning, warily checking windows, corners, anywhere the Germans could spring a trap or an ambush.  Johannson was in the lead, Garand at the ready and bayonet fixed improperly.  Rook was shadowing him, double checking each spot that Johannson had checked before.  I was in the middle with Peters, helping him carry the M2 Browning.  And Stewart was in the rear, covering our backs with his Thompson at the ready.It was quiet.  Too quiet.The bridge we had set out to capture was undefended, and we quickly set up a defensive position in case a German patrol stumbled upon us.The sound started as a low rumble.  We looked around, at each other, confused as to why the ground was shaking.  It got louder, and we could soon hear the sound of people yelling.  We readied our weapons, getting ready for the enemy to throw a grenade or fire a Panzerschreck.But nothing could prepare us for what happened next.A giant tide of German soldiers, all carrying trench shovels and primed Steilhandgranates in their hands, came around the corner, rushing at us screaming at the top of their lungs.We opened fire, but there were too many and we were quickly overrun.Stewart was the first to go, having gotten overzealous with his Thompson.  He had managed to push the wave of Germans back, when they surrounded him and began pummeling him to death with their shovels.  One of them, holding a grenade, charged Rook and Johannson from behind.  They never saw it coming.By now, it was only me and Peters, him firing his MG wildly at the advancing tide while I threw frag grenade after frag grenade.  And then Peters started to run out of ammo.Quickly, I rushed up to his position with a new box of ammunition, but by that time they were almost upon him.  Peters quickly pulled out his M1911 and managed to squeeze off a few shots, but it wasn't long before he too was buried under the mass of grey and black.I was cornered, back against a locked door while I blasted soldier after soldier back with my Sniper rifle.  But it was no use.  They descended upon me, swinging shovels indiscriminately at my already bruised and battered body.  They were relentless, beating me until at last, I succumbed to the darkness.As my vision blurred, they stopped screaming long enough for one of them to say something to me.Something that would shock me to the core.He said:""lol noob get rushed fggt""			"

			Join Trent as he tells you about one of the best FPS WWII shooters on PC that you might of missed out on! Written by Trent Video Capture and Editing by Valente		

Before the zeitgeist of perks, leveling and killstreaks consumed the multiplayer shooter market, Valve released an updated version of a successful team based World War 2 Half Life mod on their brand new engine and dubbed it Day of Defeat Source. Released in 2005, Day of Defeat was rooted in another industry fad—the world war 2 shooter. In the same year, Medal of Honor European Assault, Call of Duty 2, Brothers in Arms Road to Hill 30 and it's sequel Earned in Blood were all released. While the former games were largely single player story driven affairs, Day of Defeat Source was strictly a team based multiplayer game that distinguished itself by being extraordinarily balanced and offering phenomenal map design.  Players can enlist with either the U.S. Army or the German Wehrmacht and skirmish over capture points or attempt to arm bombs on strategic assets. Each side has six classes that utilize historic weaponry and almost every weapon sets itself apart from the opposite side's equivalent in some way. While the German's Mauser K98 is a single shot bolt action weapon that fires slower than the clip fed semi automatic Garand that the U.S. Army's rifleman class uses, it's also more powerful. Similarly, the Mauser M712 side arm carried by the German Panzerfaust units chews through enemies at close range but the M1 Carbine used by U.S. Rocket troops is far more versatile being semi automatic and highly effective at medium range. With these differences, players often built an allegiance to one army versus another based on their weapon preferences.  Each class also featured a set of quirks that required a bit of practice to master. Machine gunners couldn't effectively kill an enemy unless their gun was mounted, the recoil on these weapons is violent enough to have players staring at the sky box after pulling the trigger. This means that machine gunners are largely a defensive class along with snipers who are hopeless in mid range combat. The assault class utilizes early assault rifles which suffer from heavy recoil and are most effective when fired from a crouched position. Newcomers often favor the support class since their sub machine guns allow the kind of fast moving spray and pray tactics that modern shooter fans are accustomed to but the power and accuracy of rifle troops makes them easy prey at medium to long range where their automatic weapons are almost impotent. While it may be tempting to walk around with a rocket launcher, attempting to aim while moving is incredibly slow making players huge targets. These major differences in the play styles between classes make the experience rewarding and, in some cases, polarizing.  The six official maps offered with the game prove to be masterclasses of map design. In addition to the main lanes that take players to each objective, there are side routes that allow players to flank opponents and remove pesky snipers and machine gunners. Maps that are won by capturing all the territories feature a central capture point that requires at least two teammates to capture meaning it's impossible to go lone wolf and win a game. Uncoordinated teams will often find themselves entrenched in a bitter stalemate over these points—especially on Flash which is the most linear map of the bunch. Coordinating your teams efforts and making a big push toward an objective on multiple fronts often yields victory. It's a far cry from the lack of teamwork required by many modern shooter games. While six maps is a bit disappointing the community has stepped in to pad the play-list with hundreds of custom maps. Valve has continued to support Day of Defeat Source over the years, updating the game to include achievements and trading cards. It's mechanics are almost unrivaled almost a decade after release, in spite of the fact that the popularity of first person shooters has never abated. The aging visuals do little to hamper the thrill of rushing capture points and there are few things more satisfying than putting a bullet in an opponent's head while on the move with a K98. It's a shame that more shooters don't require the skill and cooperation demanded by Day of Defeat Source.			"

												I tried Day of Defeat: Source again recently and was expecting it to be dead. After all, the game is almost a decade old now. However, I was still able to find several populated servers at all hours of the day or night.  Old age hasn’t killed DOD:S.If anything age has worked in DOD:S’s favor. For example, it attracts an older and more mature crowd. I haven’t had to put up with as much drama or slurs from annoying prepubescent teammates as I do in more modern multiplayer shooters. Another example of age helping the DOD:S experience is how “old school” it feels. Despite the WW2 setting, DOD:S plays more like an arena shooter from the 1990s than today’s super serious military shooters. Forget aiming down iron sights. Secondary fire for most weapons throws solid punch instead. Expect to spend a lot of time zipping about, shooting dudes with crosshairs, punching them for good measure, and laughing at the exaggerated ragdoll physics. Day of Defeat: Source is not a masterpiece but it’s worth a look if you have a hankering for a shooter that isn’t too serious. "

												Day of Defeat Source is one of the better WWII titles on the market.  It is aging now, being from the HL2 era, but with a small market for WWII games there aren’t a lot of options.  The multiplayer format is good, using a capture point system.  The weaponry and combat is excellent, and holds up well.ProsGood authentic weapons Good gameplay (HL2 based)Good multiplayer formatFor an older game, the graphics aren’t awful ConsAs with other old multiplayer games the player base is very experienced and will pwn you.You may be forced to play a class you don’t enjoy.

												I played this game alot after i realised that i got it with the Valve source cd game, and i loved it almost immediatley after the really good player who made me rage left the server. But i always play this when it's christmas,The reason is that when i first discoverd this game i was sneaking up to play it at night, and thoose nights when i sat there shooting nazis, or mauling the muricans' with the oh so trustworthy shovel. I was accompanied by the warm glow from the lights in the christmas tree who stood in the room with me. And i hope i will never forget how that felt, and how i gleefully slept through the day. This feeling will always stay with me, as it comes back to me every christmas when i return to this game silently in the night sitting down to paly this game, in the company of the warm glow of christmas lights. Feeling like the thirteen year old boy i once was. And gleefully forgetting the troubles of adulthood at the moment the title screen pops up on the monitor.			"

												Day of Defeat: Source was, just like Counter-Strike: Source, an update to Valve's new Source engine. I'm not aware at all of how the original Day of Defeat fared, as I never played it, therefore I can't make a proper comparison between the two.What I can talk about though, is obviously Day of Defeat: Source, having played it quite a bit and having fun with it. The game is set in WW2, and while a lot of games are set in WW2, nowadays with the massive trend of current and near future FPSes lately, it is remarkably a refreshing change.Source obviously made the maps and models look much better than the original game. They still hold up quite well nowadays, much like Source itself in any case, so for most people there won't be much of a problem when it comes to graphical fidelity.While I don't know how the gameplay in the original DoD was like, if it was anything like CS 1.6 to CS: Source, it may have ruffled a few feathers on the original DoD community upon DoD: Source's release. Or maybe it didn't, because of the gameplay.The gameplay is most definitely this game's strong point by a long shot. There are several classes to pick from, varied enough to justify their presence in the game, and fully suit the setting, just like the various weapons you have. The shooting feels good, just like most of the FPSes in Source.Unfortunately, it suffers from not having a whole lot of variety to it, both in game modes and in maps. And by now, there are naturally also other FPSes set in WW2 that feel and play a lot better than DoD: Source. There's still a community present, so you should have no difficulties jumping into a multiplayer game however.I would get this game. It's cheap and can be an enjoyable and refreshing game experience once in a while. Plus it's a Valve game, and those come with a lot of obvious perks. (Garry's Mod models being an example) Just don't expect too much out of it.			"

												This is a good fun world war game, with a feeling of Medal of Honor and basic Valve physics (Jump crouch and somehow you go higher)Because all the old Medal Of Honor games are pretty much dead this is the next one along, and this game is good fun.I wish they would make a number two of Day Of Defeat.I loved Medal Of Honor Spearhead, and this game feels like that just has players init that is playing.Great game, great fun and worth the money and time to play.Graphics: The graphics are simple Valve game graphics with nothing special to look at, but smooth and simple to handle for any PC. (All Valve games look the same I noticed)Audio: The audio is the same as above, same sound clips in one with the added old style shooting weapons. Controls: The controls are the same as other Valve games, all the same silly jump and crouch mechanics and super easy to get used too. Would I recommend the game? Hell yes it's so much fun to play with teams and more fun with friends.			"

Product received for free
Day of Defeat: Source is my go to World War II shooter, and while it lacks any sort of singleplayer component, what it actually offers is surprisingly good. You play as either an Allied or Axis soldier and work with others on your team to accomplish specific goals, such as capturing objectives or capturing key locations. There are several classes to choose from, so everyone can hopefully find one they excel with. Visually, the game is (kinda/sorta) beautiful even these days, and the game's vibrant aesthetic style lends itself well to the Source engine that powers it. The models are pretty detailed, yet far from perfect. Moreover, the lighting of the game is actually a factor when picking your shots at other players, because it makes effective use of HDR lighting. So the light and dark colors contrast seamlessly. The weapons are also rendered quite realistically, and sound as such.Overall, this is a nice game that while being older, still has a decent playerbase and is tremendous fun. I particularly recommend this game!10/10 From Me Sweep "

												Fast paced, team oriented, objective based shooter. If your not working together with your teammates, then your not doing it right. The game still holds up even after all these years. The guns feel/sound great and the level design is fantastic. The community is suprisingly still very active, its always easy to find a 32 player server with good ping ( I play on the west coast).I hope that Valve remembers what a great franchise they have and make DoD2 or DOD:GO.

												If you are expecting a fast-paced shooter, then you're looking at the wrong game. This game requires patience and a hell of an eye if you want to be good. Do not expect that running around, guns blazing, will get you far. In fact, it will get you nowhere. Bullets are lethal, and you will die, over and over if you do not stay still, silent, and quietly pinpoint an enemy as soon as they are within your sight. I personally found it too difficult, but that doesn't mean it's bad.If you want a realistic battlefield, then I recommend it.			"

												Don't bother buying this game in 2017. It's been dead for years. What remains are about 8 servers with ""videogame is srs bsns"" roleplay nerds and other servers loaded with people idling all day to give the appearance of someone actually being there (that require 20 minutes of useless downloads so you can be tortured with Euro Pop) and stupid guidelines enforced via coding. IE: ""Wait five minutes before leaving spawn"" etc, etc. Gotta love half these servers (when you try to play on the RP nerd ones because nobody is on the other ones,) rules don't apply to those who pay X amount of money for these crap dedicated servers so they can test their crappy hacking devices and overall harass general users. They will list like thirty absurd rules as well. Seriously, don't waste your money on this ♥♥♥♥. The ""glory days"" are long gone.			"

												Best game ever!!Ok, maybe its a little to much, but it is my personal favorite.Even though it is full of little flaws, it is brilliantly one of the best games that rewards true mouse ability.It is also perfectly balanced in order to allow a multitude of gaming styles, such as patient campers, kamikase runners or jedi snipers. It is a pity that most people do not see that. But the game is mercyless to the newbie. You get be tough and persistent to endure the first hours. It is a total carnage where you are going to die several times without even understanding what happened. But after this grimm beginning, you start to realise the hard facts that this gaming valhala is a much more complex world, with lots of room for subtleness, skills and wit. I hope you can see beyond this harsh learning curve and the dated ,yet, somewhat elegant, graphics. Valve should definitely work on a sequel. What a game...			"

												Have never played the original Day of Defeat so I can't compare it to this.I received Day of Defeat: Source through the Source Multiplayer bundle that came with Counter-Strike: Source, Day of Defeat: Source and Half-Life: Deathmatch back in early 2011.DoD:S is a really fun game I would recommend to anyone who likes WWII games and also likes First Person Shooters that require teamwork.In DoD:S you either play as the Allied Forces (U.S. Army) or the Axis (Wermacht) and each side has the same classes but with different weapons and equipment. The first three classes on each team allow an unrestricted amount of players to play as. The last three classes are restricted to a specific number of players. Only two people from each team can play as the Machine Gunner class. This also applies to the sniper class as this only allows two players from each team playing at any time. The last class; explosive class, allows only one player per team playing as them.Only downside is that because the game is old there is a lack of active servers but the game is still fun.			"

												This game is one of my personal favorites. Valve doesn't do a lot with it anymore, but it still holds up greatly if you are looking for a blast to the past. The graphics and combat are so good that some newer games that are made in this day and age lack mechanics this game has. A classic WWII deathmatch game that contains 6 fun classes that are available to play on the U.S. Team or the german Werhmacht Team. This game's graphics are very nice and easy on the eyes, the gameplay is smooth and quick to learn and play, the ambience and the deaths, (not to mention the combat) are fantastic and nostalgic. There are multiple gamemodes to choose from such as capturing flags or blowing up a control point. This game will always have a special place in my heart, if you would like to give it a shot for a cheap price, I guarantee you'll have a good opinion on it, and be very happy that it's in your collection.

 It's a mad dash as I run to the entrance of the apartment complex. I narrowly dodge MG shots as I sprint through the door, German shouting and loud, continuous gunfire behind me. I eagerly make my way up the stairs as friendly soldiers run down past me. Upon reaching the top floor I greet an allied sniper only to see him get shot in the face. I wait a few good seconds before I peek out one of the windows to see several nazis running towards a capture point. Lifting my M1 Garand to my sights, I carefully follow along and wait for the opportune moment to strike... *crack!* *crack!* *crack!* *PING!* 2 dead, 3 running. I excitedly reload to take the next set of shots, when all of a sudden *BOOM* A panzerschreck round blasts me out of the window to the rubble below... Welcome to Day of Defeat: Source, a game where you will die often and love every second of it. There are many, many first-person shooters today, so much so that's it's a genre I'm beginning to feel fatigue for. But I can still appreciate when someone does it right. Make no mistake, DoD:S does it right. Guns feel heavy and real, gunshots have force and weight, and gunfights feel fair and rewarding. Every kill is earned here; there are no cheap weapons or exploits. Just you and your mouse. All the maps are paced great and feel distinct. The weapon choice is historically accurate and the guns really do feel like their real-world counterparts. Few shooters reach this level of polish and balance and I feel the need to call that out specifically. You might get this game and hate it at first cause everyone is accurate and quick and you can't seem to hit anything. But give it a week and start to get skilled and you'll understand the appeal of this bare-bones, good-time, heavy-hitting WWII FPS			"

												If you are a WW2 fan or you love hardcore shooters, this game is for you. Its a way different approach than say, Counter Strike. (You can't compare them and that's not what i'm going to do)You have 1 gamemode, it involves around capturing flags. There are two teams, the Americans are Germans. Both teams are treated equally (which is awesome, its not like the americans are the good guys and the nazis stupid germans that scream like a girl) and have six classes each with their own sets of weapons. Each class has a ranged attack, melee and explosives (grenades). Most of the classes get a backup pistol with them.The classes are: (German equipment first, the American and then what they share)- Rifleman (Mauser Kar89k, M1 Garand and rifle grenades) Has the ability to use ironsights and focuses on long-range combat.- Assault (MP40 and M1A1 Thompson, a smoke grenade and a frag grenade) For CQB.- Support (STG-44/MP-44 and B.A.R, 2 frag grenades) For mid and close range and surpressive fire.- Sniper (Kar98K Scoped and the M1903 Springfield Scoped). No grenades. For long range and to take out classes like other snipers and machinegunners.- Machinegunner (MG-42 and Browning M1919A4 (I think)) No grenades. Anti sniper, anti machinegunner and to take out large groups of enemies. Must be deployed using the bipod to shoot accurately. (hipfire not advised lol)- Rocket (not the rocket itself, the class) Uses a Panzershreck and M1 Bazooka. As a secondary you get the Mauser C96 or M1 Carbine (my fav). Anti Sniper and machinegunner.The classes all have the same health and speed. You die fast (in 1-3 shots, always 1 shot headshot) and rushing is not advised. The game is extremely faced paced and competitive. You need to work together as a team, use your microphone or voice commands to communicate. The voice commands are awesome and well voiced. Besides that you have the option to go prone (using Z as default I think) This greatly reduced recoil and makes you harder to hit. The disadvantage of it is that when to go prone or out of prone you holster your weapon for 1-2 seconds. I've died many times of this. You get used to it after a while, though. Another option is to sprint. There is a stamina bar that lets you sprint for a few seconds. You cannot shoot while sprinting. In the realism modes, when you get shot in your arm, you drop your primary weapon. A pretty neat feature, but annoying at the same time.The gunplay itself it pretty well done, it has the same feature as Counter Strike when you are standing still, you accuracy with the most guns is near perfect and when you are moving your accuracy decreases. Almost all the guns have massive recoil, and I mean massive, it takes a lot of skill to master.The base game comes with a lot of maps and many custom maps too which I don't care about. The stock maps are good and have cool shortcuts and offer a lot of replay value.There is no singleplayer unless you download a bot mod, which I haven't tried. There are plenty of multiplayer servers to choose from.The servers mostly consist of 32 player slots, which means 16 vs 16 players.For active servers DON'T use the serverbrowser, its broken, use Gametracker to locate servers instead. The EdgeGamers servers are pretty good, their clan is EgO (I think). These servers have all the realism settings turned off and have a medic mod that lets you call a medic by typing !medic in the chat. I advise binding this to a key. The medic only heals when your health is below 25 HP (that is when the healthbar turns red). Ping isn't a problem really, but above 150 ping the game becomes unplayable (no ♥♥♥♥ sherlock)There are a lot of realism servers too, but its your choice on what to play.Community is awesome and mostly mature players. There are daily around 900-1100 players online across all regions.The game runs almost on every system, I have no problems with it really, and I have a low end PC.What I hate about Day of Defeat is the constant explosive spam. Grenades deal massive damage and get spammed mostly in doorways and passages. You have the option to throw the grenades back, but this is hard to do. Best to counter the spam is to flank the enemy.Do I recommend it? Heck yes!TL:DR: great game I advise you buy it, its worth the full price or wait for steam sale and buy the Valve multiplayer pack. Same price and comes with CSS. (For Gmod textures lol)			"

												The player can choose one of 6 avaible classes to play. Each class offers a set of weapons, which can be exchanged on the battlefield. This enables an easy entry to the game but some weapons like the Rifleman are harder to play. I like this class because it offers a weapon type which has a high damage output like a sniper rifle but is still playable with a crosshair.After all those hours and years I still come back every now and then to play it again. I can recommend it to player who like a WW2 shooter setting and are familar with Source Engine Games.			"

												Day of Defeat: Source is hands-down one of the very best oldschool fps games on the market. There's a reason why after 7 years this game still carries a vast legion of steadfast followers. Counterstrike source construction set in the brutal timeframe of WWII. Gameplay consists of 50% combat skill in its purest form- game sense, aim, spray control, self preservation, and utlizing special classes (sniper, machinegun, rocket); coupled with 50% down and dirty teamwork to capture flags, demolish artillery placements, and win the round. You can run a 50:1 kdr, but it's certainly not going to win you the game. Just the same, you could be sitting on a kdr of 5-50 and still crown the leaderboard for getting in there and capping flags for your team. No single player mode in this one- if you want to be the best, you're gonna have to do it together. Highly, highly recommended.			"

												SOOO UNDERRATED!Valve doesn't update the game anymore but still this game has one of the best FPS mechanics. Simple controls.Even more entertaining if play with friends. Smooth and simple graphics.It is only 10 bucks in sale time it drops to 5 so it should be in your archive. ;Also it has VAC system that perminantly bans the cheaters so you should not worry about cheaters or hackers.Before I forget also people make too many custom maps to play. But I prefer Normandy ofc.Maybe this game will quench your trust of WW II shooter.Anyways it is worth a try.GL HF			"

												Day of Defeat is probably the best WW:II tactical game on PC, it's combat is fast-paced but can be slow at times, the range of different weapons and abilities makes the game always changing another great thing about the game is even after a couple years of being out the community is still playing it. Also the maps are some of the best WWII themed maps I have ever seen.Pros:Skill based.Alot of maps.Great design of everything.For a game of it's age it's graphics are quite good.Not that many bugs/gltiches.Authentic WWII feeling.Cons:People will normally take MG and Sniper which is quite annoying.Not many Aus servers.People normally don't play for objective.Most servers are 24/7. (Only one map EVER)Conclusion: This game is quite fun and very cheap so if you and some friends are thinking of playing something old I'd pick this up.Overall Rating 8.3/10			"

												There aren't too many successful multiplayer games in general, meaning ANY game that has multiplayer, that kept me coming back for simple endless fun. DoDS is one of them. I don't know the date of this game when it came out, but there are STILL servers that are full with 32 people. It's 2017 and I wanna say this game has been out for easily 7 years, possibly 10 or near it. It's just a great game. I won't go into detail, but the overall gameplay and community have kept me playing since I was 15, and I'm not 24. It's a bitter sweet transition from DoDS to Days of War, which is coming out on Steam on 1/26/17. I'll hate to see this game slowly fade, but it won't ever fail. I like to ask a retorical question, ""When's the last time developers made a game that was just fun for you?"" If I could make a category, label it ""Game that is 100% fun"" DoDS would be in that category. This game easily brought me over to being a PC player over a console player. Well it was definitely just ONE of the games that did. If you haven't purchased this game you need to. It'll still be alive for a few more years. Dang man, I mean... Half Life 2 Deathmatch still has full servers sometimes. If I could sum this game up in one sentence... This is one FPS game in only a handful that keep players satisfied, and wanting more at the same time.			"

												This game is quite old and dated. Many servers are dead or non-functioning. I recommend the Devildogs server on the map omaha. I would highly recomend to stay away from the (27/7) clans server snowbridge. they are very rude and have been know to ban for no reason and refuse to appeal even after one has been filed and reviewed.

												Not suprisingly the community in DOD:S is more active than that in the original game. There are several improvements brought in by the source engine. The essence of multiplayer from the first game is well-kept, and maps are amazing.The PC requirements are not very demanding so it would run well even in laptops with integrated gpu. I am running mine in 1920x1080 without fps problems.After many years it is still a great game and with a compact active community.			"

												In light of the low purchase price, worth a play!Despite the historical setting, it's definitely not attempting to be realistic or historic at all.  The performance, availability, and use of weapons is heavily adjusted for ""play balance"" rather than realism.For example, although the real M1 Garand and Mauser 98K would have had very similar performance, in terms of ability to wound/kill with a single shot, in game the 98K has been made quite easy to score one-shot kills and the Garand seems to typically require two shots to offset it's rate of fire.Every ""Rifleman"" also seems to be a grenadier, with a rifle grenade launcher and for some odd reason without hand grenades.  This deprives the German rifleman of his signature ""potato masher"" grenades.Pistols are far too common, and for some odd reason seem to do more damage per shot than the SMGs, which is exactly opposite of reality.The BAR is frequently used as more of a heavy assault rifle than an LMG as it properly should be.  The StG-44 on the other hand has been given extra recoil in order to make it into some kind of ""German BAR"", when in fact this is completely wrong.  It was the first assault rifle, and should combine the lethality of a rifle like the Mauser or Garand with the low recoil of an SMG like the Thompson or MP-40.  It really should be easy to use, incredibly deadly, and also incredibly rare.The G-43/K-43 semi-automatic rifle that the Germans fielded is completely missing, and the Bazooka and Panzerschreck, which would have been far too valuable to waste against infantry targets, are used as if they were primarily an anti-personnell weapon.In other words, there's no realism, so don't look for it.But when it's on sale for $2, it's an OK buy.

												I've never played this game in its heyday, so I can't comment on whether it used to be good or not. However, in its current state of relative obscurity, I would not recommend this, especially to newcomers. People who are good at this game (presumably veterans) seem to be fairly rude and not very helpful; the elitism is strong with this community. There are more grenades than World at War. It feels kind of spray-and-pray-ish to me (although I am a novice so I'm probably wrong). The recoil is crazy on the guns, which I guess is more of a nitpick than anything, but it's annoying. I think the biggest problem is simply that it gets no love, which at this point it will probably never get, and that leaves it in this state of obscurity.			"

												If you look at the release date for this game July 12, 2010, you'll know it's not true. Released on Sept 26, 2005 this was a great alternative to CS:S. Which I played for many years before DOD:S. This game had something different to offer than other fps games at the time. You picked classes and also allowed you to respawn, which offered continuous gameplay.In it's hay day this game was a blast, especially for competitive league players. However this game has lost it's magic and has died. I have played this game for many many years and have 2 accounts with a combined total of 2,763 hours, I have played in many different competitive leagues, on different teams and also had my own team at one point.Out of all the fps games I've ever played (since Wolfenstein 3D, 1992) this game I have always felt discriminated against for being legitimately good. Over 75 public server perma bans, hence the 2nd account.I am not trying to gloat or brag, this is a big issue for almost every league player. Unit and clan public server admins would pretty much just ban me without notice or call me hacker/cheater than perma ban me. I would even use my 2nd account with another name and had to actually hold myself back due to threat of being banned... I just always felt this saltyness from certain servers.I have in the past uninstalled this game, due to lack of server, player and league quality.If you want to purchase an FPS game look elsewhere, this game is outdated and it's hard to find a good server to play on without mods.Plus the assault is overused and probably one the worst F$%KING weapons made by an actual human being and agreed upon to be released in a game.

												Amazing game and quite underrated in my opinion.It is like a mixture of TF2's basics with CS:GO's mechanics. The game is really fun and because of the very long rounds (they can usually last an hour, and a lot of the times, even more), you get drawn into the game. You want to help your team become victorious. It really does make it seem like in you're in some war, and I sometimes feel guilty when I have to stop playing, because I'm ""deserting"" my side.Now, if you have played it before, or you are sure that you'll like the game, it is definitely worth it. But if you're not sure if you'll like it or not, I suggest waiting until it is on sale for under $5. I got the game when the Vallve Collection Pack was going for $25, and I don't regret it from all the ""hidden gems"" I got that I normally wouldn't buy.The only disappointing thing is how there's a lack of a big community still in the game, but you'll always find a few highly dedicated servers with great people and features.Because of all this, I give it a 9/10			"

												Day of Defeat: Source is a Source-based update of the original Day of Defeat by Valve. The gameplay remains much the same, but is a little faster paced and with a smaller selection of classes and weapons. That said, DOD:S is great fun to play, provided you can find a reliable server. Unfortunately, most of the game's community has moved on to other games, leaving only a small subset of players behind. In terms of gameplay, the maps are well designed and the weapons are varied but balanced. The game has aged, but still looks acceptable. DOD:S is a worthwhile purchase if you are into arcade-like WWII shooters.			"

												Day of Defeat is probably the best team-focused shooter game that Valve has released. You'll need coordination, knowledge of when and how to push areas, and decent gun handling skills. Features like the recoil, various types of movement, and the aesthetics make for an immersive and fun experience. The technology may have dated a bit, but it's by no means broken or buggy. If anything, any choppiness of your animations and actions help further the concept of immersion, unlike the butter-smooth shooting of today. It's a rough, hard world out there, and it's up to your squad to set things right.			"

												My gaming life has revolved around Day of Defeat after my fascination with Half-Life, the mods that came of it, and my family. My brother John (Fuzz) (I use his pseudonym because I look up to my brother and the name is catchy to me) and a few programmers at the time came up with the initial concept of DoD after my brother watched Saving Private Ryan. At an early age (8 or 9) I would watch my brother create sandbox levels within his newly created mod, Day of Defeat. My brother paved the way for Day of Defeat before his departure of the development team (focus on school and relationships) shortly before Valve purchased the mod and turned it into a Valve product. Soon after my father (Wes) (Fuzzdad) would join in on the efforts to help propel the game forward with level design. My father was a Major in the Army and a helicopter pilot for 13 years, to say he loves history is an understatement. His dedication to the game and meticulous craftsmanship of design with each level was researched, designed, tested, redesigned and re-tested for countless hours. I vividly remember walking downstairs on more than one occasion to his mancave and watching him design what is now known as dod_glider with the Hammer tool, Valve Software's map creation program for their game engine. I am grateful that my father allowed me to playtest his maps and give input. Fuzzdad went on to be a Valve-contracted level designer for dod_glider, dod_flugplatz and dod_falaise. He also created custom maps such as dod_factory and dod_Anvil (Made on Source) Fuzzdad worked directly with Matt Boone (Main Programmer for DoD/DoD:s and now works on multiple Valve games, also known as Mugsy) with game changes, community map pack releases, updates to stock maps, texture files, sounds, etc. I commend Mugsy for sticking it out as long as he did with DoD/DoD:S by helping the community and working with my father to better the game.Day of Defeat and Day of Defeat: Source are my favorite multiplayer FPS. It is evident Valve gave up on Day of Defeat: Source after Sourcefilms was tested with DoD:S (The trailers referring to specific maps like Donner) It's hard to blame Valve for lack of content or continuous updates with the game not breaking even on sales. The WW2 era FPS from the 90s and early 2000's has lost the populace favor but that doesn't mean this game is anything less than great.Do I recommend this game? Yes, yes and yes. DoD:S is a majestic game that has countless replay value and at its core is fun. It's realistic in terms of 1-2 bullet kills. While there is only one ""true"" gamemode (CTF) they also have demolition style maps, but the majority of what's left of public servers play CTF or realism. I personally wish they would release a steam workshop for the game or add gamemodes, but it would be safe to say DoD:S has lost it's prime motivation that it once had years ago. What's left of public servers is mostly realism units which you may or may not like (I personally find them more like a person trying to relive his/her military past and not fun in terms of gameplay) but you as a player might find that style of play different or fun.To conclude: Day of Defeat will always be a part of me and my future endeavours in gaming and I hope you the reader give this game a try, even if it's not in its prime anymore. It's still enjoyable to pub once in a while.I'll always have hope for a new DoD, maybe one day, maybe never, but I'll always have my memories of this great game.			"

												Well, there's not much I can say about this game, except that it's quite fun. Maybe it isn't as populated as some other Valve games, but you'll always find at least 2 full servers here and there. Most of the community is kinda friendly, (Rather strict in some servers with plenty of rules), experienced, relatively small, and loyal. The gun combat is quite nice, there's plenty of game modes, lots of competitive potential, and endless community maps and mods. This game is a must have for valve/WW2 fans.The only problem is that the community is rather small, and you won't find more than a few servers with a nice ammount of players in it. And if you do, some are quite strict about their rules, so if you get banned from all of them, you're screwed, my friend.			"

It's still enjoyable to pub once in a while.I'll always have hope for a new DoD, maybe one day, maybe never, but I'll always have my memories of this great game.			"

												Perfect multiplayer fps that reqiures skill, stratergy and teamwork. The game is a great laugh sometimes and has a way of quelling any indigenous sense of nerd rage amongst the competetive player. There's nothing quite like lobbing people's obnoxious grenades back in their patient faces or going on a shovel frenzy in a building of over-secure snipers. The weapons are all remarkably flawed in their own destinctive way, which makes everything a bit nitty gritty; as a world war game should be. The classes combine better than in any other game, though I do wish people wouldn't bother shouting 'Medic!' so often. There is no medic, there is no shotgun.... wtf? I've been playing since the source version came out and just recently come back after many years to find most of the servers, mostly empty, for most of the time. I s'pose time has run it's course with this one and I would just like to say simply, gg, it's been terrific.My only real criticism was with the achievements. I'm not fussed at all about them, I just noticed a few of the progressions have a tendancy to reset to 0 and I even naded 4 people once and had the achievement for a little bit before it dissappeared mysteriously. This was the first game I ever saw achievements on, when the update came in, and probably the closest that I'll ever come to giving a ♥♥♥♥ - For all the days I've defeated on this one - I have to give a 10/10 ***** Felicitaions!

												Well...apparently I have to review a game to get some kind of badge or something. I've been playing DOD since the original was in Beta. I still suck at it, but I enjoy playing it. I'm bummed there are so few servers left, but games have evolved SO much since this first came out. I don't know if they'll ever try to do a mod for the Pacific Theater...That would be my only reccomendation for a resurrection of the game. Otherwise...well, I've played it since the 90's...enough said.			"

												Just one little note: This game, no matter how awesome it is, has lost a lot of attention and thus gameservers are much harder to find especially if you live anywhere else than in Europe. It's an old online FPS shooter game, based on weaponry of the 2nd World War with Axis on one side and Allies on the other and the joy of it is entirely based on finding a good server with nice people and not least a decent and solid ping, that doesn't leave all your gaming to random chance. Hit registry and joy of the game is really based on being on an equal battlefield at the very least in regards to connection and spirit. I play in a community, that actively safeguard it from all the hacks, jerks and twits that Valve's Anti Cheat doesn't catch and it keeps the environment clean of sexists, racists, squeakers, spammers, tweakers and cheaters.  The game is quite old. It has changed a bit since 2006, but not a lot. It looks pretty nice and lifelike, but not flashy in any way and without all the bells and whistles of modern games and as such it runs pretty smooth on mid-end systems, which is also evident from the rather low requirements, but the game do look the best with everything on high, with maxed out AA and anything you can throw at it. Never compromise on quality in this regard. When I first started playing it a lot of peeps were running on old and shoddy hardware and removing a ton of elements from the game that seriously detracted from the fun of it, but those things have been fused more thoroughly into the gamee. Unfortunately there are still tweaks that gives unfair advantages. Just don't tweak. Unfortunately the default setting of the game is really old and there is no user-interface to fine-tune to any server, which means you'll have to fiddle around with convars and config files, but I urgently recommend you not to tweak too much unless you are into wanna-be hacker-tweaks of the elitist ♥♥♥♥♥ sports league, which is generally frowned upon by anyone who hasn't completely lost their wits, fun and sense of fairness. It's one of the best action games I've ever played.			"

												Day of  Defeat: source is a fun WW2 shooter.This game has great maps which are very big and have actual front lines and  vantage points for sniping, The damage from the weapons  are accurate and they are balanced and none are underpowered, the recoil is decent and as i said before  the weapons  are balanced so it doesn't take for you to pump a full mag into the enemy for it to kill them. Also the weapons are  detailed and look awesome. Also this game is very challenging.I rate this game 9/10			"

												I downloaded this game last Friday cause me and my dad used to play it when I was little. Let me tell you, it has gone way down hill. Now, I do not cuss very often, nor do I ever use racial slurs. And I have been banned from about 4 of my favorite servers already. Why? Cause friendly fire is on, and people will jump in front of you, and you team kill, and then you get banned. Or, your on the mic, and say, ""oh my god"", and get kicked for using religious slurs. And no, it doesn't depend on the server. Cause one of my favorite servers, nicknamed the ""blitzreig wh*res"", banned me for team killing in a close quarters hallway with a support class. I got banned from my most favorite server because I don't know. This guy literally said, ""that's not tolerated"" and banned me. This game used to be so fun, and everyone just had a blast. Now its an uptight, strict, clan run, admin abusing embarrassment. Don't waste your ten dollars. Unless you want the WWII expirience so bad your willing to sacrafice your own fun.			"

												Do you like cookie cutter FPS titles with overpowered unlocks at high levels that promotes quick scoping and camping, where DLCs are more inportant that the players. Well this isn't the game for you. this game rewards skill and teamwork rather than 5 year olds with overpowered AKs SCREAMING I banged you mom at you. Here are the reasons I recommend it.1. it has no leveling or unlock system so every player whether your a noob or a MLG PRO GAMER you will be using the same guns.2. maps are well designed and feel authentic (all take place in France so sadly you can't fight in Russia or Germany).3. I got this game for free but I feel that $9.99 for a FPS is a great steal.4. This game will run on just about anything for expamle I have a 1 ghz motherboard, and 8 gigs of ram and I can run this thing on high graghics and get 30-40 frames.5. Theres no DLC all content is on the game.6. The weapons are feel so authentic and fun to shoot I still can't get anough of the garand ping.7. There are still servers tho most are modded (I play on a server called DoD AXl)8. The classes all serve a perpose to the team's survival9. There are very little bugs and glitchs10. This game was made by Valve and we can all see that Valves got a good track record9/10			"

												DoD source is one of the best WWII shooters out there. It's fun to play, the shooting is satisfying, and the graphics look surprisingly good. The art style is also very appealing. Valve did a very good job at balancing the two factions, mostly the rifleman class of both. The Germans have a Kar98k bolt action and the US have the garand. The Kar98 is mostly a one shot in the chest and the garand is a 1-2 shot kill but less accurate and it excells in close quarters.

												I am really addicted to this game for some odd reason. I haven't been able to not play it for a least a few hours a day. When you start to really get a feel for all the guns it's really fun. I've played other FPS games and I sort of got burned out and didn't play them any more, but this on the other hand just keeps getting better each time I play. It is so worth the price that it is right now. If you enjoy FPS games that take place in WWII this is the game for you.			"

												DoD source is one of the best WWII shooters out there. It's fun to play, the shooting is satisfying, and the graphics look surprisingly good. The art style is also very appealing. Valve did a very good job at balancing the two factions, mostly the rifleman class of both. The Germans have a Kar98k bolt action and the US have the garand. The Kar98 is mostly a one shot in the chest and the garand is a 1-2 shot kill but less accurate and it excells in close quarters. I would very much recommend picking this game up for the low price of $9.99.			"

												I believe it was in my Junior year of highschool when I was taking a Spanish class that we were tasked with creating a ""Mexican"" themed dish and bringing it to school to share with the class. Being the procrastinating and absent minded little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I was, I forgot to prepare a dish until the morning it was due. I hastily scrambled some eggs with pepper and salsa and preteneded that it was Mexican food. Of course no one wanted any and I can't blame them, so I packed up my eggs and put them in my backpack. While my pals and I were horsing around someone fell on my backpack and the eggs splattered over the inside, but I didn't really care because I was about to go home anyway.That was the last day of school before our Easter vacation which lasted about a week. I neglected to clean up the egg abomination in my backpack, and so it sat the duration of my time off from school. By some miracle I didn't notice the smell until I was at school again, and the smell sent me into a dry-heaving spasm. People around me started saying, ""What's that smell?"". I quickly stuffed the egg-ridden backpack into my locker and ran off to class. Due to some possible divine intervention no one figured out that I was the cuplrit.			"

												DoD is a game that combines great graphics, great gameplay, and great environments. Unlike CSS, Day of Defeat is a game which is always intense and doesnt leave you waiting for a long time while your team finishes the round. Instead, your always in the battlefield no matter how much you die which creates a setting in which lots of people can take place in a 30 minute bloodbath....WW2 style! Day of Defeat is one hell of a game.			"

												It's a shame a lot of people aren't playing anymore. It's a great teambased shooter that blends hearty weapons handling and frenetic pacing to offer a gameplay experience that no other Valve game is like. Great maps with thoughtful, balanced design and aesthetic, true-to-life allied and german voice call-outs, and many game modes let the player really feel like they are Running through wartorn towns, streets, fields etc.The game rewards teamwork yet still allows skillful play to shine through. Multiple and highly distinct classes top off the experience. Not os perfected as the original DoD in my opinion but this game is quite fun and can get pretty engrossing when the explosions and bullets start flying and you hear the foreign language of the enemy in the distance. If only more people were still playing. DoD needs an update/proper sequel.			"

												While not as great as it's predecessor (Day of Defeat 1.3) as it lacks some content such as maps and weapons, and even one team (British), this game is still really fun and entertaining to play. It's hit detection is better then most of the other Source games and most of the weapons are pretty balanced from team to team. Overall, I don't feel like explaining much right now. But basically it's a fun game. I'd prefer to pick it up when it goes on sale if you feel like buying this game like I did for around 2.59 or so.If I were you I would pick up the first one if I were you if you didn't have it already, It's good to, but I would get this one if you have the first one and you really enjoy it :P "

												Day of Defeat: Source is my go to World War II shooter, and while it lacks any sort of singleplayer component, what it actually offers is surprisingly good. You play as either an Allied or Axis soldier and work with others on your team to accomplish specific goals, such as capturing objectives or capturing key locations. There are several classes to choose from, so everyone can hopefully find one they excel with. Visually, the game is (kinda/sorta) beautiful even these days, and the game's vibrant aesthetic style lends itself well to the Source engine that powers it. The models are pretty detailed, yet far from perfect. Moreover, the lighting of the game is actually a factor when picking your shots at other players, because it makes effective use of HDR lighting. So the light and dark colors contrast seamlessly. The weapons are also rendered quite realistically, and sound as such.Overall, this is a nice game that while being older, still has a decent playerbase and is tremendous fun. I particularly recommend this game!			"

												Quite possibly one of the best WW2 shooters out there.A very steep learning curve, in regards to the guns and their accuracy, but so very rewarding when you get into the flow of things.Visually pretty and sounds great. Some great voice commands to scream as your getting shot at/shoot at something.A few weak point thought. My main gripe is the melee. This is a game where you gotta SELECT the melee weapon. They include and are limited to a knife/knuckle duster contraption that your guy refuses to use to its full potential and just thumps enemies with it rather than using the seemingly VERY SHARP KNIFE PART, or the spade. Yep, a spade, why not? Geneva convention? Wuzzat?Oh, or the best melee weapon; Your fists. But you can only use YOUR FISTS, if you have a smg. No no, ONLY IF YOU HAVE AN SMG. I really feel the melee lets this game down, and would be better with a designated melee button that attacks with whatever you got in your hand.Other than that, fun times.			"

												Lets be real. Day of Defeat: Source is a old game. (2006 to be exact) It was built on Source, the engine Valve engineered for Half-Life 2, Day of Defeat: Source features amazing graphics and physical gameplay for its time back in 2006. The main object of the game is to cap all the flags and then the round is over. Most servers that you play on unless its a 24 hour server of the same map will then change after one team caps all the flags 5 times. Day of Defeat: Source is kind of like a WW2 game of Counter Strike but with this game you can respown after you die before the round is over. There has always been cool mods for this game that make you crawing back for more and more. Game mods like Left 4 Dead (DoD:S) stile, realism mod and gun game just to name a few. The game is smooth and movement at times can feel like your just floating while in movement. What keeps me interested is the fact that the game is easy to learn but hard to master. You have to learn how to compensate for recoil of every firing weapon in the game. If you are not happy with the sights that are the defalt sights you can always change them to your liking to diffrent cross hairs and diffrent colors. There are not that many set backs to the game besides that all the models are the same. However you can go on Gamebanana and download any skin you may like and change it up a bit even change the weapon skin. At times you might feel like your team is at a disadvantage because of your map postion but thats again is what keeps you into the game. The number one thing that will keep you into the game is the community. This community is very helpful with any questions you may have about the game. Just know that if you have never played Day of Defeat: Source dont expect it to be like a Call of Duty game that is easy to play. Like said before this game is easy to learn but hard to master. Before you start to play just know your going to die and die a lot but, with time and good practice you will start to become better. Dont expect it to be like a Call of Duty game that is all about how many kills you get per round but more so about just having fun with other players. Most if not all hard core Day of Defeat: Source players HATE Call of Duty and do not appreciate when little kids talk all about how Call of Duty is so much better. The game is very cheep for what you get and you will not be let down.			"

												This game is near dead and I can see why. The servers that are left are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones that play only 1 map 24/7, or they are the stupid gun game ones where the map is something out of ♥♥♥♥ing tron. The few servers that are frequently populated are fun until you get into the same old grind. The way the game goes is that there are 5 flags. Each team spawns and they charge to capture the middle. once a team has the middle they simply camp by setting up mg bipods and snipers. The riflemen run around throwing grenades as fast as they can into the enemy spawn. As the one being trapped in the spawn, you are most likely killed when you stupidly poke your head out to fire by a sniper or mg, or by a grenade as you make the short trek to the fight. There is very little fighting in the sense of one player hunting down a sniper or two soldiers going at eachother. Probably 90% of the kills ever made in this game were with grenades. The only way to get a kill without being riddled by an mg is to bounce a grenade off a wall and hope some dumb ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ steps on it. Overall this game is dying, but not dead. Like the original Day of Defeat which I also have, There will probably be players 10 years from now still playing the same map 24/7, having hundreds of hours played and millions of grenades thrown. I don't enjoy any game that does the 24/7 one map setup because I find that veteran players know everything there is to know about a map and will completely own a noob who dares to buy a game and tries to have fun in what they thought was a cool ww2 shooter. I would avoid this game unless it's on sale. I have played maybe 7 hours and I doubt I'll be playing much more. Stay away from this game and the original if you have a temper becuase if you get banned from one of the few servers left, you will not be enjoying your game much longer either.			"

												I was playing on the Wehrmacht side against the US alongside with my brother on dod_flash. The americans captured the middle flag and pushed us to the last 2 remaining flags. Shortly after they captured the fourth (farm) flag and we only held our spawn flag. We were on the brink of defeat because everybody in our team were dying over and over but then the two of us stood up and started to push them back. I went around the road through the farm flag and managed to capture it, killing 3 enemies along the way while my brother cleared the houses up to the middle flag. We met up in the middle , shot everyone who where trying to get there and we took it back. Then we finally received reinforcements from our team and we were ready to push the fight to the americans. Our team charged both of their flags and won the round in just over a minute. Moments like these are awesome in this game and they alone are worth playing the game.Strategy in DoD:S is more than important and it's so awesome that this FPS game even allows you to do that, ie: well selected classes, good positioned MG's and snipers, smoke grenades - all make a difference in this game. Although alot of strategy may be involved in this game, it still kinda feels like a classic FPS arcade game with good graphics and source engine which makes it play great. The only shame is that alot of people don't want to try to play as squad or a team to capture or defend flags, in most servers there are like only 3 - 4 people of total 8-10 ppl in your team who try to work together while others are in their own little worlds.Day of Defeat: Source is a great game, much better than most modern shooters in this day and age and I rate it 9/10			"

												Warning: TL;DRMe and Jim run for the door. Alex is swift to follow. Towards us come a hail of bullets, and I clasp my sniper firmly in my hands. The Wehrmacht are capturing buildings to make sure their attack works. Not if we can help it. This building will remain ours. Jim picks up his SMG and aims it at the corners. Me and Alex follow behind him, as our weapons aren't suited for the close quarters. I have a sniper. He, a mount-machinegun.The explosions outside are deafening, and the enemy fire has started again. In comes a fellow american soldier with his SMG. He runs ahead of Jim in a hurry. I don't know why. He enters the next room swiftly. We hear gunfire. Then we see him fall to the ground like a puppet. We know what to do. Jim throws a grenade into the next room. We hear shouting, and then a loud explosion followed by a final scream. A german helmet lands in front of us.Me, Jim, and Alex run up the stairs. Jim guards the stairs, just like he said he would. Alex mounts his machinegun on the windowsill, and I look through the scope and look out the window.I see hell, as dozens of Wehrmacht soldiers storm houses and execute our fellow american soldiers. Alex can't watch anymore. Wehrmacht take cover as Alex mow them down. American soldiers still fighting in the streets, being shot by snipers from other buildings thank us, though many lose their lives because of the Wehrmacht. Only the ones taking complete cover still live. And yet, a large group of US forces enter the street from home base, half of them shot to death by the large force of Wehrmacht machinegunners and snipers.Suddenly, Alex just falls down, and his helmet rolls of his head. Blood oozes out through his forehead. I will never forget the shock on Jim's face, and the expression on the face of the corpse.My turn. I like through the scope and look to the windows of Nazi-occupied windows. I pass a lot of empty windows, but then I see one with a sniper. He is aiming down the scope to the streets, right at the head of an american soldier. CRACK. Fire erupts from the barrel of the sniper, and the soldier lies dead. Now the sniper is aiming at another soldier. My turn. CRACK. A bullet meets his head, and I am happy to have fired it. His helmet flies off. I now look to the streets. A group of Wehrmacht are taking cover behind the remnants of a wall, one of them being a machinegunner, firing hundreds of bullets per second. CRACK. His gun stops shooting, and while the gunner hits the ground, the group look for me. I get down to hide, but It's too late. One of them saw me, and now shouts ""Scharfschütze!""A loud BANG erupts, and the oddly loud noise of a swish hits me. I realize what happened. A german must have fired a Panzerschrek towards me. I yell at Jim to take cover, and then a rocket hits the wall next to the window. I go deaf for a moment. Then I hear German soldier yelling at eachother below me. Jim looks at me with the face he makes when he is scared. Then he looks back down the stairs.German boots hit the ground. Sweat runs off the palms of both of us. I try telling him we need to parachute out the window, to escape, but Jim refuses. ""Stick to the plan,"" he says. Then he starts firing.I can tell he's having trouble with the recoil, because soon the bullets go further up, and a Nazi has a chance to aim at him and...The Wehrmacht soldier pulls the trigger. Jim stops shooting. Jim just looks at the ground. Then a great red puddle forms beneath him. Jim is dead. Alex is dead. That american soldier we just met. Dead. I have two choices. Jump out the window, or avenge Jim (or die trying). Second option sounds appealing. I will never bow down to this tyranny. I am a soldier, and I will fight it.I approach the stairs. I know I am going to die. I know we are going to lose this battle. But to me, that doesn't matter. I will be together with my brothers, and every day of defeat, is another chance at victory.			"

												One of the best multiplayer FPS I've played...why ?-> It's fun, especially with friends-> Source engine, meaning that you can shoot through some walls and graphics are still nice-> Several classes, each has a role to play-> Weapons handling is great, you feel the recoil,  you need to ""hold"" firmly your aim when shooting in automatic-> Communuty is good, especially when people know the goal of the game; play as a team, take flags (objectives) and plant bombs or defend positions			"

Really Nice game better than I thought it would be when I bought It !Positive Aspects:-Decent Graphics-Challenging-Alive and active community (When you launch the game there is between 1300 and 1700 people playing it)-Excellent Game for people who play and enjoy other source engine games such as Team fortress 2 (Dod Source has 9 classes like TF2) and Counter-Strike titles -Fast Paced ShooterPositive and Negative:-The game isnt a WWII simulator like Red Orchestra , so don´t buy this if you are looking for a simulator , but unlike Red orchestra , Dod Source is much easier and you will get used to the game quickly .Negative:-Team Balance : Servers with bots , will sometimes result in teams almost filled with bots only , against teams with lots of players and few bots.-Bots are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in some ways , they head into battlefield and middle points of maps like crazy , and get shot easily , BUT they can be headed for one direction but if you are behind them , the bots Will turn really quickly and kill you , neither a good player nor a Noob would do that like they do! (Not joking , here´s a good reason for you to buy the game to check it yourselves :D )All in All , I really recommend such a great First Person Shooter!Final Verdict: 9/10 "

												A classic WW2 shooter done in the source engine. The much anticipated sequel from DOD on HL was a successful release, with lots of hype and a solid playerbase upon release. The game had many online competitive ladders for the years it was being played. DODS is a relatively fast paced shooter, requiring steady aim and understanding of every gun and how it feels. Although an older game now, I feel the gameplay is similar to that of COD II but with the feel of the source engine.Worth buying in the modern day, this game still holds itself as a good WW2 era shooter.

												Even though this game is starting to  look  rather dated, the mechanics are still great. This game is one of the most well-made and well-polished FPS-game there is. It has silky-smooth animations, rock-solid gameplay mechanics and proper, realistic sound design. This game is what we call a no-boshiet experience. It is clean, well made and solid. If you are looking for a game that offers a proper solid FPS-experience set within a realistic setting and playing with serious yet helpful people, this is the game for you. But if you are looking for a game that has plenty of deep grinding/leveling-features with killstreaks and ballistic knifes, this game is far from anything you would enjoy. If you long back to the days of when online FPS-games were pure, solid and required skill, yet don't like that kick of nostalgia, then go for Day of Defeat: Source.			"

												Pros- Small but friendly community.- Not hard to find a populated server, especially in the EU- Pretty realistic gun mechanics. (Except Lmg's which are broken)- Alot of custom map servers.- Graphics look good still.Cons- LMG's are broken, when mounted they are almost as accurate as a rifle, they do a ton of damage, and there is no damage fall-off for the bullets, so sometimes you will be sniped across the map by a LMG.- Very small map pool. Only 9 official maps, so it wont take you long to master them all. But we have custom map servers to remedy that.- Snipers are like AWP's in CS, they do 1-shot-kills on head and body shots, so some maps you really need assault classes to smoke them.- It's not the best WW2 shooter. If you want a WW2 game that is more casual go to Call of Duty 3 or World at War, but if you want a more realistic WW2 game then go to Heroes and Generals. It trys to be like a middle ground between casual and tactical shooters, but CS in my opinon does that better. Not saying its bad, but its kinda weird in alot of aspects.8/10			"

												Everyone has a mental list of legendary games, which stand against the test of the time: This is one of mine. I've never played a fluid and fast-paced WW2 shooter such as this in my years of gaming. I started playing this in high school, and now I've graduated from college and am teaching abroad and I am STILL playing this game. I love it to death and I hope the community stays intact until the next DOD. For any newbies, this is a great time to start playing because the intensity has dwindled (unless of course you saunter your way into a Chinese server -- Good luck). Furthermore, a lot of older, self-defeated gentleman tackle this game whenever their wives and children are not vacumming their life force away. So please, play this game. It doesn't play ""realistically"", but it is extremely effluent and feels like a Grade-A WW2 shooter.			"

Intense, great community, great game play, and wonderful graphics still! If you get the chance to get this game do not pass it up. It will NOT do you wrong i promise.			"

												I'm average at this game. I will tell you one thing, this is a time killer (what games aren't these days). If you are into history (selectivly WW2 times) this is an FPS MUST HAVE. You can fight on either side, American or German. Each side has its own unique classes, within those classes there are unique weapons. The maps are amazingly designed, so well that sometimes you wish you were there, disturbingly.... 9/10			"

												I've played this game for well over 10-12 years, in all it's different betas and configurations. And i can honestly say it's the best game i've ever played in my entire life, and that's coming from a guy who has played everything and i do mean everything...The community has always been good aswell. And one thing  that is recurrent throughout the entire ""dod"" community is that everyone comes back to the game sooner... or later. If you played this for a time you will always come back to it since their is nothing as satisfactory then putting up a great killfeed in ""dod"".Long live it, and RIP.			"

												Day of Defeat:Source is an online WW2 FPS. It starting out as a Half-Life Mod is one of Valves lesser known titles. I really enjoyed this game and still do, I hope the online communtiy can get as many players as it used too. It's game that is too good to be put down, it really stands out for me. Not only does it offer strategic gameplay,intense FPS skills, and overall replaybility, but it offers a almost immersive enviroment that I've spent some of my best gaming experinces in. I don't want to see this game die, and I hope it will become popular again.			"

												DOD is one of (if not the best) Multiplayer WW2 games to date. It is rewarding, and exciting, but you have to put the work in to get the most out of it. The community of DOD is the best I have come across, next to no squeakers, good server communities, and everyone seems to know eachother. However, what might explain this is that a large number of players have been shooting nazis since the original Half-Life mod, and are incredibly good at the game. This means that it does take a fair bit of playing to get anywhere near their level, especially if you are new to Source games. Map awareness plays a big part, so it is essential to know all of the regulars. DOD plays alot like counter strike, as there are (nearly) no scopes, and spray and pray is out of the question. It is a more tactical shooter than most FPS, but is definitley also not a realism shooter. Verdict: 7.5/10TL;DR good game, you have to put the work in to get max enjoyment out of it. great but skilled community. Tactical FPS. "

A remake of the mod. It features 6 classes, and teamwork is needed to win any round. There are modes similar to TF2 with having to cap the controlpoints/flags, there is also a search & destroy type mode where one team needs to blow up 3 points, while the other side defends. There is many servers with a decent amount of players. Other then the constant grenade spam on most maps I give this an 8/10			"

												A classic WW2 shooter done in the source engine. The much anticipated sequel from DOD on HL was a successful release, with lots of hype and a solid playerbase upon release. The game had many online competitive ladders for the years it was being played. DODS is a relatively fast paced shooter, requiring steady aim and understanding of every gun and how it feels. Although an older game now, I feel the gameplay is similar to that of COD II but with the feel of the source engine.Worth buying in the modern day, this game still holds itself as a good WW2 era shooter.

In this multiplayer game you are forced to really cooperate to win a match, you'll want to speak at your microphone, you'll become friends with enemies cause you're keeping on killing each other in the most funny ways.Should I be left with just one videogame for the rest of my life, it would be Day of Defeat.

												My favourite Valve multiplayer shooter. Pure, fast paced (but not too fast!) fun, maintaining the high pace/realism balance in a pleasant way. It is focused mostly on pushing the frontline from one team's base to another in order to take over the tactical points. To win, you don't really need the best aim or reflexes, you just need to be smart and think somewhat tactical. Constant spawns don't make you rage over every death, but rather keep on trying. And the game's cheap, too!			"

												I rediscovered this game at a LAN Party. We ended up playing 4 vs 4 with 1 bomb remaining to be planted for each team. 2 defended, 2 attacked. I cannot remember the last time a game made me shout, yell, kick, sweat and curse with such intesity. Some games are just made to do that, even if they have to wait for years to be discovered, and that's a quality worth praising. DOD Source will steadily, but securely, ascent to the title of 'veteran' and be worthy of hosting fabulous evenings with friends. The mechanics are simple, the objesctives of the game are clear and the imprecision of weapons make every kill a delight. An absolute surprise and a welcomed addition to the ""always lit"" games in the Steam library.			"

												Day of Defeat : Source or  DOD and DODS is a game set around the time of the rule of hitler, world war two, and the reich. you may choose between two teams..the reich or the allies. You then have classes.There are six classes in all. You have to go through areas and fight your way to take over a checkpoint or fight to bomb a certain place. This game is very fun and there are still people that play it. The maps do a very good job in showing what a real world war two map may have looked like back then. I recommend this game and the ten bucks you spend on it is very much worth while.			"

												Day of Defeat keeps the skill & team based action that Day of Defeat 1 had. It puts you into the combat boots of WW2 infantry of the axis or allies in 12 awsome maps, with more than 100 unofficial maps. Day of Defeat Source has the same score for me as Day of Defeat 1, 100/10.                                                  WARNING: This game is very skill based and hard.			"

												Fun classic WW2 based FPS game. Since game become old, there are lots of experienced players. Going around in the public server is too difficult to play because of them. It would be more fun and easier to play with friends or somebody with competitive match style.밸브의 작품답게 명작이긴 하지만, 타 밸브의 작품들에 비해 사람들이 너무 줄어들어버린 게임(하프라이프 2: 데스매치 수준으로 많이 줄어든 상태). 오래된 게임인 만큼, 경험자들도 매우 많기에 공방 서버에 가서 하면 너무 어려운 나머지 빨리 지루해질테다. 아는 사람들끼리 하는거라면, 재밌는건 둘째치고, 횔씬 쉬울것이다.

												Oh man. Word of advice, do not use hax in this game regardless of how uber they are. Yeah I was at the top at one point getting 20 head shots per match, knowing exactly where to aim because I could look through walls, and laughing my butt off as enemies tried to evade me using smoke grenades. Once I got vac banned though it all went downhill from their. I was no longer allowed in 98% of the servers. People who once idealized me for being the king of head shots now spit in my face. And worst of all, I am the biggest noob when I'm not high off hax. Word of advice kids, do not do hax. I've been down that road before. Yeah it may seem glamerous being unbeatable but it will catch up to you. Do right! Play fair! Say no to hax.			"

												Ok, ever heard of Counter Strike, TF2, And WWII? Well I atleast hope you know about the WWII 1942 Times in Germany well this games relates to that time in war, it's a two team war game USA Army, and Wehrmacht, Wehrmacht are German Soldiers in WWII Times. Its TF2 Because how the gameplay and team war based of the game is, its like Counter Strike, because sorta same thing it's like CSS But DoD Aka Day of Defeat. DoD:S and CSS, I hope you know what im trying to say they have ""Source"" at the end of the names or the game and its like that hard to explain how its like CSS. I reccomend this game for ages 12+ on my opinion from how it is, yes I am 12 at the time 2014 but, does that really matter unless you are the parent reading this and does not like your young daughter or son playing games that have, Blood, Violence, and WWII 1942, because in real life 1942 WWII was bad times. I hope this review helped you parents, ladies and gentleman to know more about the game before buying it.			"

Custom ""Orange"" maps (arena style) were lots of fun.I haven't played this in so long that steam only shows 11.2 hours. Thats because I played 1000s of hours before steam started recording these things....Probably the game I have played the most of. Would buy a new DoD game instantly....why no DoD:GO :(			"

												One of the best multiplayer WWII FPS experiences out there. This game is really easy to get into and several years after its release still has enough players playing to make it easy to find a good sever to play on. The maps are always fun to play and having a good strategy between your teamates ultimately determines which team is better.

												Day of Defeat:Source is an online WW2 FPS. It starting out as a Half-Life Mod is one of Valves lesser known titles. I really enjoyed this game and still do, I hope the online communtiy can get as many players as it used too. It's game that is too good to be put down, it really stands out for me. Not only does it offer strategic gameplay,intense FPS skills, and overall replaybility, but it offers a almost immersive enviroment that I've spent some of my best gaming experinces in. I don't want to see this game die, and I hope it will become popular again.			"

												Wonderful game brings back many great memories! I remember as a kid at 13, 14, and 15 playing the original DoD. This is by far hands down the best WW2 era game that you can play! Intense, great community, great game play, and wonderful graphics still! If you get the chance to get this game do not pass it up. It will NOT do you wrong i promise.			"

												I'm average at this game. I will tell you one thing, this is a time killer (what games aren't these days). If you are into history (selectivly WW2 times) this is an FPS MUST HAVE. You can fight on either side, American or German. Each side has its own unique classes, within those classes there are unique weapons. The maps are amazingly designed, so well that sometimes you wish you were there, disturbingly.... 9/10			"

												I've played this game for well over 10-12 years, in all it's different betas and configurations. And i can honestly say it's the best game i've ever played in my entire life, and that's coming from a guy who has played everything and i do mean everything...The community has always been good aswell. And one thing  that is recurrent throughout the entire ""dod"" community is that everyone comes back to the game sooner... or later. If you played this for a time you will always come back to it since their is nothing as satisfactory then putting up a great killfeed in ""dod"".Long live it, and RIP.			"

												I love this game; I just started playing again and it really is just plain fun.  You get the realism of guns not being super accurate (like CSS where guns don't have much recoil).  And it is just a lot of fun because you have to play with other people.  Only problem is there is no offline play...			"

												My first ever Steam and multiplayer game EVER! This game is very close to my heart, I love it so much! I remember back in the day when this was still regularly played, and I played Zombie mode all day and night. The game is kind of dead now, there's still a few servers, but the zombie days are over. If you like Counter Strike: Source then this should also interest you, as it kinda plays like that game. Back in they day the first thing that would cross my mind when I heard ""Steam"" was Day of Defeat because it was the only game I had. I love this game mostly because what it was to me. It still deserves credit, it's just not maybe as good as I make it out to be.			"

												Fun classic WW2 based FPS game. Since game become old, there are lots of experienced players. Going around in the public server is too difficult to play because of them. It would be more fun and easier to play with friends or somebody with competitive match style.밸브의 작품답게 명작이긴 하지만, 타 밸브의 작품들에 비해 사람들이 너무 줄어들어버린 게임(하프라이프 2: 데스매치 수준으로 많이 줄어든 상태). 오래된 게임인 만큼, 경험자들도 매우 많기에 공방 서버에 가서 하면 너무 어려운 나머지 빨리 지루해질테다. 아는 사람들끼리 하는거라면, 재밌는건 둘째치고, 횔씬 쉬울것이다.

												Day of Defeat : Source or  DOD and DODS is a game set around the time of the rule of hitler, world war two, and the reich. you may choose between two teams..the reich or the allies. You then have classes.There are six classes in all. You have to go through areas and fight your way to take over a checkpoint or fight to bomb a certain place. This game is very fun and there are still people that play it. The maps do a very good job in showing what a real world war two map may have looked like back then. I recommend this game and the ten bucks you spend on it is very much worth while.			"

												Ok, ever heard of Counter Strike, TF2, And WWII? Well I atleast hope you know about the WWII 1942 Times in Germany well this games relates to that time in war, it's a two team war game USA Army, and Wehrmacht, Wehrmacht are German Soldiers in WWII Times. Its TF2 Because how the gameplay and team war based of the game is, its like Counter Strike, because sorta same thing it's like CSS But DoD Aka Day of Defeat. DoD:S and CSS, I hope you know what im trying to say they have ""Source"" at the end of the names or the game and its like that hard to explain how its like CSS. I reccomend this game for ages 12+ on my opinion from how it is, yes I am 12 at the time 2014 but, does that really matter unless you are the parent reading this and does not like your young daughter or son playing games that have, Blood, Violence, and WWII 1942, because in real life 1942 WWII was bad times. I hope this review helped you parents, ladies and gentleman to know more about the game before buying it.			"

												11/10BEST. GAME. EVER. Great community, infinite replay value, fun fun fun.Started to play it in 2003 with version 1.3, then I quit when Steam came in and Valve decided to shut down the WON servers. I'm back now after 10 years and I still enjoy the game in a grazy way. In this multiplayer game you are forced to really cooperate to win a match, you'll want to speak at your microphone, you'll become friends with enemies cause you're keeping on killing each other in the most funny ways.Should I be left with just one videogame for the rest of my life, it would be Day of Defeat.
