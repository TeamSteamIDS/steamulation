												Portal is a first person action game of logic and strategy developed by Valve in 2007 and released in a package called The Orange Box .The player wakes up in a glass room , the Aperture Science development center, where he is subjected to a series of experiments until ...... well I will not spoil the  game ....Each experiment is guided by Glados voice, the mainframe development center computer. Glados is one of the best virtual characters in recent years. That computer has more personality than many humans from other games.Throughout the game the player acquires a portal gun. This gun allows you to create portals, to enter and exit portals in order to go forward in the game, which requires solving logic puzzles to advance. You will  acquire a good sense of physics, position and movement.The game is a marvel of Valves creativity. Many would prefer to kill zombies in left 4 dead , but personally, I think games like Portal are those who write history. The game lasts a few hours and when it finishes,  with music and lyrics, it makes you want to stand and applaud. No other game in recent years has touched me so much when it ended. It is an ode to creativity.Its sequel , Portal 2, expands the concept of the game and makes it much longer, making it a standalone game. The Portal 2 was named Game of the Year in 2011 for various publications.The game was released for Windows PC , PS3 and XBOX 360 before being ported to MAC OSX.Now that I've finished the review I want my cake ! .----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ESPAÑOL----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Portal es un videojuego de lógica y estrategia en primera persona desarrollado por Valve en 2007 y lanzado en un paquete llamado Orange Box. El jugador despierta en una sala de cristal, el centro de desarrollo de Aperture Science, donde es sometido a una serie de experimentos hasta que …… no les voy a arruinar el juego....En cada experimento lo va guiando una voz, que es Glados, la computadora central del centro de desarrollo. Glados es uno de los mejores personajes virtuales de los últimos años. Esta computadora tiene más personalidad que muchos humanos de otros juegos.A lo largo del juego el jugador adquiere una pistola de portales. Esta pistola de portales le permite generar portales para entrar y salir por donde le es posible e ir avanzando en el juego, que requiere resolver acertijos lógicos para seguir adelante. Para ello hay que adquirir un buen sentido de la física, la posición y el movimiento.El juego es una maravilla de la creatividad de Valve. Quizas muchos prefieran matar zombies como en el left 4 dead, pero personalmente creo que juegos como el Portal son los que escriben la historia. Finalmente al terminar en unas pocas horas, con musica y letra, dan ganas de pararse y aplaudir. Ningun juego posterior a portal me emocionó tanto. Es una oda a la creatividad.Su secuela, el Portal 2 amplía el concepto del juego y lo hace mucho más largo, convirtiéndolo en un juego independiente. El Portal 2 fue nombrado Juego del Año en 2011 por diversas publicaciones. El juego se lanzó para PC bajo Windows, PS3 y XBOX 360 para luego ser portado a MAC OSX. Ahora que terminé el review quiero mi torta!.			"

												I will be brief: I downloaded demo and played for 5 minutes. Then I removed it, went to the store and bought  Portal 1-2  bundle. That same f'n day - 16 of July, 2011. The consequences: 50+ hours, all challenges completed and the place earned in my digital heart for ever.The first Portal is for sure shorter, has less story and features than the sequel. Though it has something... the mistery, the charm, the feel of menace, elegant sci-fi scent and terrific GLaDOS who hasn't gone over the top yet. Valve, put your sorry Dota 2 down and please make games like this just like you don't care.			"

												Portal, rather than a game, can be considered a metaphor of life. We wake up every morning with a commanding voice that, like it or not, pushes us to face trials increasingly difficult to get a prize. A voice that we find strange and that we don't know if we could trust. A voice that can come from the outside but also from our own unconscious. We never know if the final prize is real but we are armed of portals. But what are the portals if not the ability to be able to see the world from different perspectives? The portal is the human ability to abstract being able to immerse himself in aspects of the world that had been hidden by the limitations of the senses. Ok, if you're already confused, I understand. Just buy the damn game.			"

												""The cake is a lie!""It is, but Portal does not lie as it truly is a good game! While short, its puzzles make it an interesting game so much so that you'd immediately want to do a 2nd walkthrough. Also, there is a way to replay several of the so-called ""chambers"" but in a more difficult version.I'm not sure if this has mods like its sequel - nevertheless, it's worth completing this one before moving on to the next as the puzzles are even more difficult and diverse in Portal 2.I like how the game has a background story while it would not be necessary, at all. It has an excellent antagonist in the form of an A.I. called GLaDOS.Portal is a memorable experience and if you liked Half-Life you should pick up this Valve product, as well.Oh, you didn't like Half-Life? Then, please go and have a cake. :)PS: I'm not sure why I have zero hours logged for this game. Probably because the logging system was introduced after I completed Portal. In any case, my review is based on a gameplay time of roughly 15-20 hours.			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Portal  Original Release: 2007 Genre Tags: Innovative; Puzzle; Sci-Fi; Action; Funny My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 2-3 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Novelty seekers; Casual gamers  REVIEWPortal is an amazing experience. In terms of video games: it is the very definition of short & sweet. There are many people out there overly concerned with the length of games, and I believe Portal is an excellent example of why one shouldn’t immediately scoff at a short game due to prejudices. Sometimes 3 hours of perfection is better than 20 hours of mediocrity. Sit down, immerse yourself, and just play through the game in one sitting as you would if watching a movie. It is worth it.I say this because I believe this is a game best enjoyed in one sitting. There are no lulls or down points, and every second of the game is riveting and purposeful. The whole experience is so genuinely entertaining and the pacing is so perfectly on point that I think it is designed to be played like this. In this way, I see the length of the game as a strength and not a weakness… but maybe I’m just crazy.But what is it that makes the game so genuinely entertaining in the first place? Everything… and then some. The concept is innovative, the puzzles are intuitive and interesting, the atmosphere is captivating, and the dialogue is hilarious and flawless. And when all of these facets come together in the finished product, the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. And a game is created that transcends opinions: it is undeniably great.Honestly, I respect everyone’s right to their own taste in video games; but if you don’t enjoy Portal, I would dutifully suggest you consider finding a new hobby. I would find it very hard to understand how anyone could possibly not enjoy this game if they consider themselves a “gamer.”If you haven’t yet had the luxury of experiencing Portal, then I envy you. Stop thinking about it and just go for it.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Portal is definitely a one-of-a-kind type of game. It's quirky at best, but it also remains clever, resolute and perfectly presented to those with likings for a quick-wit and a scientific explanation for including physics in a well-thought out and intelligent game, all with a touch of dark humour. It's quite rare to see a Steam user with a huge game library that doesn't include Portal nowadays. Heck, this game was my very first purchase.You awaken in the deserted Enrichment Center of Aperture Laboratories; a fictional science research corporation, located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Known for the creation of the handheld portal gun, as well as the heavy rivalry the complex has between the Black Mesa Research Facility. (The scientific complex focused in Half-Life. Half-Life and Portal both share the same universe.) in Portal, you play as the silent protagonist, Chell, from a first-person perspective as you are challenged to navigate through a series of cryptic chambers, all the while being accompanied by the voice of the Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System (GlaDOS for short.) which the sociopathic robot subsequently reveals the rest of the plot to the player, through various and long-winded narration throughout the game. And what is this reward you get for all this mind-wrecking work? Why it's none other than cake! While on the subject of sweet chocolate butter-milk frosting, assembled with maraschino cherries on top, this all turns out to be a crude lie, and you're sent to be burnt to a crisp by GlaDOS. As you narrowly escape death, you navigate through the many things that Aperture Laboratories would have wanted to keep as a secret to the rest of the world. You soon (or later, as this game has a way of messing with your head.) find yourself exploring the air vents, empty corners with obscure writings on the wall, the sewers of the facility, as well as the abandoned, deserted offices of those who mysteriously left the complex, along with empty food supplies and crude drawings that uncovers a much darker history of the laboratories.What strikes me most surprised is this game's ingenius concept and profound knowledge of linear momentum and physics. Your only weapon in the game, if you can call it a weapon, is the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. It's main and only ability is to create two distinct portals, an orange and blue portal, which both create a visual and physical connection between two different locations in three-dimensional space. Keep in mind that neither portal are both an entrance or an exit; all objects that travel through one portal will exit through the other. This unique concept will soon be taken to the test, as you explore, solve and escape through 19 mind-wrecking chambers all the while keeping your distance both far and dangerously close to heavily armed turret bots.But, you're not alone in this deranged prison of a laboratory, your square-buddy (and probably only buddy.) known as the Companion Cube, will accompany you throughout a few of these chambers, as it has a handful of most needed traits; involving you using it as an extra step for those hard-to-reach places, using it as a shield against deadly laser spheres and deflecting them into switch mechanisms, and even going as so far to hold out weight-activated button switches. Sadly, with every chamber completed thanks to your Companion Cube, you will have to eventually abandon it and leave it for trash, in the Emergency Intelligence Incinerator. What a true friend to the end!When cracking down to the lifespan of this game's story, it's actually pretty short. But, with each new chamber you progress through as well as the difficulty beginning to rise at a much faster pace, the longer the chambers will begin to mess with your head and could leave you stuck for a good couple of hours, completely stumped. I'm guilty to say that I even needed a guide to deal with a couple of these cryptic and twisted chambers. But then again, that really ruined the experience for me a little, considering I like to figure things out much more independently. So, if you can unwrap things around your mind quick and efficiently, you may experience the amazement and creativity for yourself. I'm pretty jealous in fact.This game is a big recommendation for me. The scientific aspect of portal and three-dimensional space used in this game is best described as baffling. Valve must have been truly blessed to ever release this game, as it touched the hearts of kids, adults and professional scientists alike.			"

Summary (TL;DR)Portal is among one of the best games in my library, I am honestly suprised I didn't play this game sooner given how much I've heard about this game before. The storyline was very enjoyable, the graphics are great (even compared to the graphics for games in 2015) and the mechanics were probably the most fun to play around with.This game is well priced, and there's a ton of mods to enhance your game experience even further!Pros Great storyline Great graphics Amazing mechanics Progressively gets more challenging A pretty universal game, there's something here for every type of gamer. Challenging achievements Controller support Has subtitles Neutral Points I felt the storyline was a bit short, but I'm not counting that against it. Cake song was awesome- See end credits.Cons The first game to ever make me feel motion sickness from messing around with the portalsRating9/10			"

												Anyone else agrees that valve make really depressing games? The source engine has great physics but always looked strangley dull to me. Anyone else realise no matter what game you play, there is always some sort of nature involved. In 99% of games you will at least see grass, trees, plants, the sky, the sun or at least other characters. But not this game. Portal has no life in it at all, and no one else in the game at all (the only enemies you will see are the turrets which are only in very few segments). You can't even see the sky, you are completely trapped and deprived  in a colourless building which is why the companion cube, turrets and glados are so memorable because they are the only things you are exposed to in the entire game. Now if this was not done the right way, Portal could have been a very boring game, but since the innovation of the portals and glados and all the other highlights are added in, those things are going to get full attention from the player since nothing else is in focus since everything else is so bleak, which also why the escape sequence is so much fun, because you want to get out of this place and back outside That is ♥♥♥♥ing genius!!!

												Life was meaningless.I had no purpose other than to continue my work, the only thing I had ever known.  Work had been fun at first, and my boss had seemed nice and rather witty.  However after some time, my boss began acting strange.  It started with the lying.  Then, my boss began to intentionally make my work dangerous.  I survived, but only through quick thinking and a bit of luck.Eventually the everyday grind of navigating my way through a neverending maze lost any appeal.  My boss promised me cake  when the job was completely done, but it wasn't worth it.  I wished for something, anything, even death, that would rid me from this meaningless existence.  I was tempted several times to walk infront of a turret or fall into the radioactive slime, but the pain these methods would bring seemed greater than the pain of a meaningless life, so I carried on.Then one day, my boss had a surprise for me.  He had brought me a Companion to assist me in my work.  Or more specifically, an Aperature Science Weighted Companion Cube.  At first, the Companion Cube assisted me with basic tasks which I nonetheless couldn't have done without it.  We rounded a corner and came face to face with a ball of radioactive energy coming straight towards us.I thought we were doomed, but then the Companion Cube jumped in front of me of its own accord and shielded me from certain death.  My mouth dropped, as I imagined the pain the Cube must have been experiencing.  My boss said something about ""symptoms of enrichment center testing"" and ""perceiving inanimate objects as alive"" but I paid no attention.  I knew this was love.  I knew this was real.We continued on together for a while.  The Cube was essential in completeing the task my boss had set for me.  I tried talking to it, but I received no response.  My boss then oddly informed me that the Companion Cube would never threaten to stab me (as if it would ever)...but more importantly he informed me that my Cube was mute.  I felt a pang of sadness - not the selfish sadness one feels when they lose something, but the true sadness that is felt when empathizing with another being.This revelation did not hamper my love for my Cube, my Companion, who had brought happiness and joy into my life, and who had selflessly endured pain to save me from death.  After opening the final door which would lead to the elevator I had grown quite familiar with, our boss seemed to congratulate us on our new found compaionship.  But then the bos said something which would change my life forever.""However, [the Companion Cube] cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and, unfortunately, must be euthanized.  Please escort your Companion Cube to the Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator.""I gasped in horror, looking across the room and seeing what I now realized must be the Incinerator.  I fell to my knees, tears already streaming down my cheeks.  I looked at my faithful Companion and proceeded to envelop it in my arms, determined to never let it go.My boss continued on as if nothing was wrong.  ""While it has been a faithful companion, your Companion Cube cannot accompany you through the rest of the test. If it could talk - and the Enrichment Center takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot - it would tell you to go on without it because it would rather die in a fire than become a burden to you.""""You could never be a burden to me!"" I cried, and hugged my Companion Cube to my chest.  But then I remembered.  Although my boss had lied to be at one time, boss had since promised that he could no longer lie to me.  I had to finish the testing, or else I would never get the Cake.  And if the Cube couldn't come with me...didn't want to come with me...I hugged it one last time then picked myself up off the floor.  I walked slowly, hesitantly, toward the button that would open the incinerator.  It took more willpower than I've ever needed to press it.  Then I picked up my Companion and held it over the flames.  Tears clouded my vision and my hands began to sweat uncontrollably, and not just from the heat.  I held it there for what seemed like hours, just crying and admiring its beauty.  But then I remember the Cake.  And the Cube slipped from my hands.""You euthanized your faithful Companion Cube more quickly than any test subject on record,"" said my boss.  ""Congratulations.""11/10 would euthanize my Companion at the behest of my boss and all for a piece of cake again.			"

Portal (Puzzle-platformer)This is a title that most gamers have played, and if not played, have at least heard of.  If -- like me -- you are late to the party and have yet to play the game, this review is for you... and hey, there's CAKE!There are tabs for the various options:- Keyboard, where you can re-map keys- Mouse, where you can enable the controller- Audio, with separate sliders for Game & Music.  Subtitles are NOT the default. I highly suggest turning them on, as the mechanical voice is hard to understand.- Video, where you can choose Full Screen vs. Windowed, Aspect Ratio, Brightness, Advanced, and Resolution (up to 1920x1080)I was happy to find that the game is mostly controller-compatible... The crouch function doesn't seem to be mapped, so if you're going to use a gamepad, use the Ctrl button on your keyboard to crouch ;)The concept is simple enough.  You (will) have two guns, one that produces a blue portal, and one that gives you an orange portal.  In one, out the other.  Solve puzzles and move on to the next area.  Easy right?Well... Yes and no.  The portals themselves aren't difficult to figure out, but you have to master the physics involved to truly progress in the game.  I had a hell of a time grasping the this point because I was so disoriented when I was falling.  Here's a hint: You need to gain some momentum if you want to make some distance when you exit the second portal, and oft times that means falling -- not just jumping -- through a portal. There is some platforming involved, and a variety of obstacles (of course, what kind of game would this be if there weren't obstacles?) in your way, both benign and deadly, and through it all is your ever-present narrator-guide.  I don't recommend muting her, as you'll miss out on both the ambience and a huge part of the story if you do (subtitles alone just aren't the same~).But.. what story?  O_o The game is tagged story-rich, so I was surprised to find that there wasn't much of a story at all!  Sure it was interesting, but story-rich?  But then... finally... It all changed.  Sure it was something I was expecting, but things didn't pan out exactly how I had anticipated, either.You will have to get through 11 chapters before approaching the end of the game, and as you complete each chapter, the Developer Commentary becomes available (accessible via the main menu.)  Whilst you're in commentary mode, you can't be damaged, but you also won't gain achievements.Speaking of achievements, there are 15 to be had, and only 1/3 of them can be gained by playing through the game.  There are Advanced Chambers and Challenges available via the Bonus Maps section which is where you'll earn the bulk of your achievements.It's easy to see the influences that this game has had on modern gaming, especially games like The Talos Principle.  Portal is on the short side, but well worth playing if you enjoy puzzle-adventures, especially if you plan on playing Portal 2.			"

												There is no other game for me personally, that I would consider perfect, other than Portal.There is literally NOTHING flawed in the game, nothing at all I can think of.The pacing is impeccable, with the correct timing on music and ambient playback with the story.It covers all types of pacing with music and ambience in gameplay, from the slow and depressing downward spiral of thinking you may never escape (Self Esteem Fund from the OST), to the fast paced finale music of the game. The game made me go through so many emotions all in the expanse of my first time playing around 3 hours.The game is UNBELIEVABLY clever, yet doesn't need to break the fourth wall to do that, which is incredibly impressive.The game's humour is absolutely timeless, it is old as hell (9 years from this review point), and yet the jokes are still brilliant. witty, and dark. There are almost NO games that do it on the same caliber of Portal, hell, not even Portal 2 could live up to this godly creation.The puzzles are beautifully made, completely fair (no fidgety rubbish) and once again, timeless in the sense of enjoyment. Visually, you might think this game is nothing to write home about, but to me, once again the game shows how age will NEVER affect this game. NEVER. simplistic visuals will always be timeless, intricate wank in videogames will ensure it stays contemporary.I think I play through Portal 1 at least once a year. The game is short, and scales next to nothing in comparison to other games, but unlike those said games, which take hours upon hours of your life, portal will only take an hour or two. But it stays with you for life, and allows you to experience true perfection in a videogame.I generally hate analogies for this kind of stuff, but if you can think of some other medium with a perfect technicality and timelessness to it (think of Citizen Kane or something), then Portal is that kind of game.I think most people in the year 2016 will have played this by now, but sometimes you just gotta pour your heart out for something you cherish a bunch.Valve may not be the greatest company, but some small dev team in there brought us absolute perfection, and I thank them for this experience with complete content.

												Different people like different games. If you like shooter but don't like RPG, it's fine, don't play RPG. If you like both, play both. But once in a while, a game comes along that is so great that EVERY SINGLE GAMER should play it, even if they don't like games of that genre. Portal is one such game. Portal is a first person puzzle game. It was a great game when it came out, it's a great game even now. Even if you don't play puzzle games, you should still give it a try. The puzzles aren't too difficult. The game slowly introduces new mechanic so that it's really easy to grasp. And solving the puzzles are soooooo satisfying! What's more? It's a puzzle game that has a great background story and although there is only one character other than the main protagonist, it's one of the best NPC in video game history. I don't think I have ever loved an NPC that tried to kill me so bad as much I love GladOS. Portal 1 and 2 are THE BEST puzzle games I have played in my life and are two of the best games of any genreI have played in my life.			"

												Portal is a unique puzzle game that will bend your mind in ways you never thought were possible. Although it is a short game, Portal will have you at the edge of your seat just waiting to see what crazy experiment GLaDOS has in store for you. Don't let the 3 hour main quest deprive you from buying this game. Portal is a enjoyable experience that I will come back to. And yes you will be baked and then there will be cake.			"

 One of the most amazing original and unique games I have ever played Holy crap, I've never been so addicted to a game in my LIFE, and I've played hundreds of 'em! I literally could not leave my computer until I had beaten it and figured out all the puzzles for myself.... AMAZING gameplay, and quite humorous as well, I might add! (listen to ""Still Alive"" during the credits....lol!).An amazing game that requires you to think in a new and unique way. Add in the ability to replay the maps with even harder difficulty and challenges adds to the replayablilty. Looking forward to the maps the online community is bound to make! I guess I dont made a single puzzle as it should be done. My Friend who watched the whole 3 hours while playing always said: ""Are you kidding me? No way, that worked man!!!"" xD  "

												Everything that you've heard about 'Portal' is true. Well, if you've heard nothing but great things about it, that is. Because this is easily one of the greatest puzzle games to ever be created. Hell, it may even be one of the greatest games created, period. It's like 'Half Life 2' but on crack! You thought crack was bad for you, didn't you? Well it turns out that crack is good when combined with elements of puzzle solving and first person shooters. 'Portal' may be short, but it's pretty damn cheap too. And when you take into consideration the difficulty of the added challenges after you've completed the story, it should take a decent amount of time to complete.Nevertheless, it's refreshing to see a first person 'shooter' without bullets and if you haven't picked this game up that's something that you should probably be doing right about now.

Short Verdict: A great puzzle game strongly based on spatial orientation, physics and some platforming. If you don't know it already, the basic premise is having a gun capable of shooting two portals, between which you can travel to solve puzzles. Portal is a classic and, as you'll see below, I can hardly say anything bad about it. You should at least try it (there's a demo available, or so it seems)!Pros: Smart puzzles, with great balance between pure thinking and skills (a bit too much on the skills side for my personal taste, but I wouldn't say it's a con) Great atmosphere that builds up throughout the game Fun side-quests, like finding radios and taking them to the right spot, and also putting down security cameras Even has advanced levels and challenges for hardcore playersCons: Apart from Least Portals, I couldn't find challenges any fun, especially the Least Steps challenge. Carrying objects around is slightly too clumsy. For instance, I'd like to be able to rotate what I'm carrying.Bought on: Got it as a gift from Xsesis! Thanks a lot! It's been as cheap as US$ 1.99 (or R$ 3,99) on Steam. That's a steal! Definitely worth more.			"

												Portal is one of the most fun games I have played in a long time. It is a combination of first person camera view with an almost pure puzzle solving game style which is an awesome combination in my opinion. The events of Portal take place within the Half Life universe. During the game, you take control of Chell, who wakes up inside the Aperture Science Enrichment Center. You are informed by GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) that you will be participating in the testing of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. As you progress through the testing chamber, it becomes more readily apparent that all is not as it originally seemed.The portal gun adds a whole new dimension to puzzle solving. All throughout the game, you are presented with situations that will seem near impossible to overcome. After some thought, it becomes clear how you can use the portal gun to solve the puzzle. As the game progresses,  the complexity of the puzzles increases and you often have to think two or three moves ahead in order to progress further.After you complete the game, two new modes, Challenge and Advanced, are unlocked. The Challenge mode forces players to solve the same puzzles again, but this time, with time or movement limits restricting them. Advanced mode simply ups the difficulty of puzzles by adding new obstacles and hazards.Portal is extremely short. It will take only a few hours to complete the whole game but the minimal time you will spend with the game, is well-worth the money.Sounds 9/10Graphics 9/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 9/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Portal is a first-person puzzle game developed and published by Valve and released in October 2007. You play as Chell, a female protagonist that completes testings for Aperture Science Laboratories. The game features a nineteen level campaign that allows you to solve puzzles. Solving each puzzle progresses you further into the story. This review will discuss the campaign, the levels, and gameplay.Portal features a solid campaign that provides a good introduction to the world of the Laboratories. The game begins with an in-game tutorial introducing you to the portal gun, the tests and Glados, the antagonist AI computer. Portal excels at storytelling through the slow burn approach to the story. Certain sequences in the story subtly reveal major plot points such as what is Glados planning to do to Chell once she has completed her tests. These subtle hints provide excitement for those who have noticed them as it foreshadows the final scenes in the game. Portal 1 is less about story and more about introducing you to the environment. I get the vibe that this game is more like a prologue to Portal 2 because comparing Portal 1 to Portal 2, P2 expands on the gameplay and environment and emphasises the story whereas P1 introduces you to the setting, the characters, the type of gameplay, and the story. In saying that, I do really like the introduction to the characters as Glados is a refreshing computer personality in which gives the impression that robots control humans, or Glados controls Chell.The campaign as mentioned includes nineteen levels and these levels are basic. It promotes creativity as the levels progressively become more difficult. However, I feel the majority of the levels are simple and relatively easy compared to the final five levels. The final five levels are challenging and they require more thinking, meaning they encourage more exploration on how to complete it. The levels are of good length. About 10 out of the 19 levels took some time to complete and it lengthened the game and made it more enjoyable because the overall campaign was short at under three hours. Portal features an 'advanced levels' mode which takes the final six levels of the campaign, reworks them and makes them much more difficult to complete. I did not play this mode because I prefer not to replay the same levels with no end goal. Generally though, it does add some variety and lasting appeal to the game for players.Portal incorporates some vibrant and detailed gameplay, particularly in the portal gun. The portal gun allows you to create two portals that transport you from A to B. Comparatively, Portal 1 delivers on the shooting aspect of the portal gun because when shooting the portal gun there is a visible bullet that travels and it creates a graphics effect when it hits the target. This exceeds the portal gun shooting animations in Portal 2 which once you shoot the gun it automatically hits the target. Furthermore, the portal gun has fitting sound that complements it. I only encountered one issue in the entire game, which is relatively minor, and that is the somewhat less-responsive nature of the controls. For instance, picking up objects would regularly require two clicks on a regular basis and when some levels have timed sections it can become slightly annoying.Portal has very optimised performance. I played on max settings at something like 200FPS after turning off V-Sync. With V Sync enabled, I managed 50FPS and minimal stuttering.  Conclusion  Portal is a very solid game. It introduces you to the robot-run world and the world of testing. The story is fun in that it introduces you to the setting and characters through a slow burn story approach. The game has nineteen levels which I completed in under three hours. There is an advanced levels mode featuring the six final levels in the campaign that are more challenging. I get the notion that Portal is a prologue to Portal 2 as it is establishes all the aspects in the game, which is vastly expanded on in the sequel. In saying that, I enjoyed this first instalment into the Portal series. At USD$9.99 as a standalone product, I recommend it. However, I highly recommend the Portal bundle at USD$22.49 which includes Portal 1 and 2.  Rating  Overall: 7/10  Pros  - The slow-burn approach to the story.- The gameplay that refreshes the FPS genre.- The very detailed portal gun with excellent animations.- The emphasis of creativity in the levels.  Cons  - Length of campaign.- The simplicity in half of the levels. If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												I won't lie. I have never played Portal before January 3rd, 2016. Sure, I've seen videos of Portal & seen my friends play it on their PCs, but as for myself - I have never played Portal before then.So I'm glad I got it gifted by a friend right before the sale ended.Did I enjoy my time playing this game?Well obviously I did.Time to review.The StoryPortal's story is already pretty well known and it's a rather simple one as well. And that's what I like about it. It's a very simple story to grasp & follow with enough bits & pieces of vagueness like the random rooms with writings & stuff all over it really add to it. I would go in depth more about it, but there's really all there is to say about it. It's just such a simple story that I'm left with barely any words on how to describe my opinion on it.I would make a separate section for the ""Characters"", but really, the only notable character throughout the entire game is GLaDOS. Starting off as this rather friendly robot voice telling you that you're doing a good job & proceeds to explain what each puzzle does and whatnot and then by the end turning into the game's enemy was great. I hardly ever got bored while playing, honestly.Yeah, that's all I can say on the story aspect.The GameplayAs per Valve tradition, this game uses the oh-so-beloved Source engine. Because of this, the gameplay really doesn't need much explanation. In this game, you solve puzzles or ""tests"" as GLaDOS calls them. At the beginning you go around the testing rooms just picking up & placing boxes on buttons to proceed, later get a portal gun that fires only blue portals to help with these tests & lastly you get to upgrade your portal gun to also place orange portals, giving you far more mobility to, basically do the same thing - place boxes on buttons. You also do things like redirecting energy balls into receivers to open doors. That is a very ""in a nutshell"" description of what you do in this game, but it's just enough to give you an idea of whether or not it's your type of ""thing"".In lamence terms - this is a puzzle game. But it's far better than the way I described it here. Trust me.Are there any other guns besides the portal gun?Nope.Can the portal gun damage enemies?Nope.This game is purely puzzle-based and it's a nice change of pace for the first-person genre, really.It was a very relaxing experience, if anything, even the times when the game got tense.The PresentationNote: This section covers the game's graphics, performance, voice acting and soundtrack.How are the game's graphics? They are simple, but god they look good. I've played this game on the lowest settings since my computer is a piece of trash & I was stunned at how great the game looked on 800x600 with lowest settings. Really! And the performance of the game was also rather noteworthy! Again - I am using a totally trash computer and this game managed to play out rather pleasantly at 40-50 FPS average, with it dipping below 15 when there were lots of particles involved. I am super impressed, really! The voice acting for the turrets & GLaDOS was tremendous. They felt realistic, given their appearance and it gave off the atmosphere that they are, indeed, robots. Lastly, the soundtrack - I...didn't hear much of the soundtrack, I think this game has like 4 songs total. However, the songs that did play were pretty good. Loved the ending piece ""Still Alive"" a lot though. Great song.Final VerdictOverall, I think I have been missing out all these years by not playing Portal. It's a very relaxing game, even during tense parts & most importantly - I had a fun time.There's one huge drawback to it - the game is only 2 hours long.But, regardless, it was great & I highly recommend this game.Portal gets a score of:7.5/10Short, but relaxing and it can work on pretty low-spec computers as well.Recommended!

												There are a few games that I can recommend to everyone and will continue to recommend to everyone until the end of time. Portal is just one of these games-- where a gamer can fall in love and someone new to video games can find a challenging and engaging experience that tests your mind. Each level is designed to build up the gamer to feel confident that the challenges aren't impossible and by the end of the game you feel as though you're the only one that could have possibly thought of that particular answer... of course there are only a single answer for each level but Portal is built for you to enjoy every moment of the game. 10/10 great game			"

												Portal is one of the most fun experiences I've had in gaming. The plot is simple; Your name is Chell, you're being tested in a research zone named Aperture Laboratories. You're only contact is an Ai named GLaDOS. She gives you various hints on how to pass the chambers and provides a bit of backstory to the events that happened prior to the game. You get a portal gun early on in the game which will allow you to create easy ways to travel from one part of the room to the other. But they can only generate portals on solid concrete.The chambers get progressively harder and all the while GLaDOS becomes more malicious in her comments. For completing all the trials your character is promised cake and grief counseling in the end. Portal is a great puzzle game. The gameplay is really fun and GLaDOS has some of the funniest and creepiest lines of any video game character. Some of the chambers can be pretty frustrating but once you figure out what to do, you'll have a lot of fun. This game challenges the mind and gives you a great sense of satisfaction when you've beaten the game. It's an all around great experience.			"

Not playing Portal is a big mistakeNo seriously. What are you doing with your life? How could you ignore this masterpiece for so long? You probably think your efforts will be rewarded with cake. It won't. The reward is the game itself.Positive:- One of the most memorable gaming experiences of my life.- Hilarious, incredible, and amazing script and voice acting. Shout-outs to GLaDOS. It still amazes me that the one and only voiced character will entertain, anger, surprise and sadden you throughout the game. - Companion cube loves you <3.- Puzzles are well throughout out and designed.- Very friendly learning-curve. - This game is perfect for both gaming beginners and veterans. Beginners are taught how to handle gradually-tougher puzzles, making Portal very non-frustrating. Veterans on the other hand will encounter challenging puzzles along the way. - Replay value to the max.- Great ending-credits song.- Graphically the game still holds up.Negative:- There is no cake.Conclusion:What are you still reading this for? Play Portal already! "

												I enjoy puzzle games, so I bought Portal expecting some puzzles, and that's exactly what i got. It really makes you think, and challenges your brain to solve complicated problems. There's 19 main levels, a long escape level, and an ending boss fight. It only takes a few hours to complete, but it's worth your money. The game isn't just a puzzle game, though. It has an interesting storyline, too. The ending of the game makes you wonder, ""Well, what happens next?"" I bought both Portal and Portal 2 in a bundle, expecting that I would want to play the second game too, and I was right! Lots of people play only Portal 2 and not Portal, but I would highly reccomend playing Portal before even opening Portal 2. Fantastic game!			"

												Portal is a fascinating puzzle game that was first introduced in the Orange Box, a bundle of random Valve games like Half Life and Team Fortress 2. The story is that you play the role of a test subject, Chell, trapped in an abandoned building known as Apature Science. A mysterious voice instructs you to go through several test chambers with the use of a portal gun, a device that can shoot portals in order to teleport one place to another. So it all relies on your skill and brain power in order to escape Apature alive, while enjoying some cake for your victory... maybe. As the name states, the game is all about portals. Wether it be using portals to get to a higher area, or to get a weighted cube to hold down a switch, it's always fun to just mess around with the portal gun. There are 19 Levels and most of the puzzles are pretty easy, so it's a short game. There are also advanced maps and time trials that'll keep ya busy if you think the game is too easy. While it's sequel is much more popular, it's predecessor is still fun to play.			"

 Portal	 Pros: + Classic+ Puzzles can be done without walkthrough help.+ Fun Puzzles With A Nice LIttle Story+ Extra Difficult Levels+ Cake Cons: - Short- No Real Replay Value- Lies Review I was always hesitant to buy Portal for I am not a fan of puzzle games, but it was on sale and everyone told me it was great so I got it and I was happy with what I bought. Portal 1 and 2 are the only puzzle games that I have played and enjoyed. That is high praise for I played many puzzle games and the Portal series are the only ones I liked. You play as a human test subject and try to complete puzzles with a portal gun. If you like puzzle games with a nice little story this is the game for you. There is a reason this game has overwhelmingly positive reviews.

												Portal is a very interesting game, your given a gun, and your main goal is to complete all the tests chambers with  that gun, without getting killed, therefore you will earn yourself cake  The cake is a lie!	 . Portal has it's pros and cons, some of which are the concept is absoulutley...AMAZING! You will probably never see a game like this again, so it's best to get your hands on it. The music? There is none....just kidding, beat the game and you will find yourself one of the best songs you will ever hear. This game is actually kind of scary too, some of the sound effects and looks, can give you the spooks, and that's more in Portal 2 though, since it has creepy looks at the beginning, loud noises and all the goodies you could imagine. Here's the bad part, theres only about 3 hours of gameplay. If your looking to get all the achievements, it's right around 30 hours, and theres only like 12? 13? They're ridiculously hard. Some of them, requires you to move 2 steps. HOW IN THE WORLD DO YOU DO THAT? Yea, the achievements are hard. Second game? Theres 1 achievement thats tough, get 1 friend who's NEVER done co-op before, it can be tricky, but it's still worth it. Both games are filled with story. If there was a third one, I'd totally get it, without a hesitation.			"

												TL;DR: Portal is a great game with near-perfect level design and lots of enjoyable mechanics. The modes outside of the main mode aren't very good, but if you're looking for a solid game that will take you a few hours to beat, this is the game for you.	Portal is a game where you try to get from point A to point B by using different mechanics such as portals and cubes. The game does an outstanding job introducing its mechanics gradually, so that way the player isn't confused nor bored. The game's story, level design, mechanics, art design, and progression are amazing, however the alternate game modes (namely being the steps and time challenges) are a bit lackluster. LEVEL DESIGN 	The levels in Portal are simply amazing with everything in each level working together to bring the player a great experience. Everywhere the player needs to go is highlighted by an object or an art asset, so the player never feels lost. Even though this may seem hand-holding or too easy, the game will still leave enough puzzles to the player to add enjoyable gameplay with a large sense of satisfaction at the end of each puzzle. Some of the levels in the game have different shortcuts that only experience players will find. These shortcuts add replayability to the later few levels of the game, as the player will most likely not find all of the shortcuts in his or her first playthrough of the game. MECHANICS 	Portal's mechanics are very consistent throughout the game, and compliment the level design. Portal does a great job of keeping the mechanics consistent so the player knows exactly what to do. For example, you cannot place portals on dark surfaces or metal throughout the entire game. All of the games mechanics interact with the level design to create a cohesive puzzle that is extremely entertaining. In the game, every time you see a large button, you know that there is a cube nearby, and the level does a nice job of explaining where the cube is. Also, in the earlier levels where momentum is needed to solve a puzzle, there is always an extended piston so the player knows where to place his or her's portal. The piston tells the player that momentum will be involved, so the level design and mechanics work well together. ART DESIGN 	The art design in Portal is very simplistic, which puts emphasis on the different aspects of each puzzle. It's very hard to get lost in Portal, because the puzzles stand out so much against their environment. In Portal, because everything is so simple, it gives the player a sense of ""Everything is here for a purpose."" The art style also does a great job of telling a story. In the game, certain areas opt-out of using standard lights, and instead use these small rooms hidden behind opaque windows to give the player a feeling of being watched. The art design in Portal works really well with the gameplay and the theme. ADVANCED MAPS 	The advanced maps in Portal add a little bit more to the game, but I don't think they're anything to write home about. The advanced maps in Portal add obstacles, and remove shortcuts to the already existing levels to make them harder. I didn't spend much time with the advanced levels, as they're built on the same maps from the main game, because I feel the main game's maps are a lot more open with what way you solve the puzzle. Each advanced map has only one or two ways to solve the puzzle, whereas the main game of Portal has lots of different ways to solve each puzzle. Overall, I prefer when there are lots of ways to solve a puzzle as opposed to just having one way, so I didn't enjoy the advanced maps as much. CHALLENGES 	In Portal, there is a separate mode called ""Challenges."" The challenge maps are the exact same maps from the main game, however you have a second goal, such as using the least number of portals, taking the least amount of steps, and completing the level as fast as possible. Completing each one of the later levels with the least amount of portals I found pretty clever and fun, but the other challenges have lots of problems. I found the least number of steps challenge to be ridiculous and unenjoyable. The mechanics needed to complete the level with a gold rating, I found to be pretty frustrating and irritating to pull off. Another issue with the steps challenge is Chamber 17. In Chamber 17, most of the level has nowhere to put a portal. Having nowhere to put a portal completely takes away from the challenge, and becomes an annoying game of timing each jump. The final challenge is the time challenge. In theory, this challenge should be pretty fun as it let's anybody try to be a speedrunner. However, for a few of the challenges, the time given to get gold is extremely low, and turns the challenge into constantly saving and reloading. This problem could easily be solved by giving the player a few more seconds to get gold. Overall, most of the challenges are not fun, but they do add lots of replay value as the player must try each challenge over and over again until he or she gets gold. DEVELOPER COMMENTARY 	The Developer Commentary in Portal is put together well, and is pretty interesting. If you're interested in the development of games, including art design, voice acting, and level design, then I recommend playing through the Developer Commentary.Portal as a whole is an amazing game, that has incredible level design. The game does have some problems in its other game modes, but the main game is still great. If you are even remotely into first-person games or puzzle games I strongly recommend this game.			"

												Portal is a first person puzzle series made by valve themselfs. So before we jump into this review we must praise our lord and savoir Gabe Newell.There are many more good points than I expected there to be for an 7 year old game. The graphics are very good seeing as the age of the game, you could say it's graphically better than some current ones, no offense to developpers who don't focus on the graphical aspect. You get guided along the way with a robot voice called Glados and I must say she has more humor than the most game characters. For example she says ""Your test is almost over and after you""ll be baked and then there will be cake."" The humour itself in this game was also very good, the boss level was very entertaining thanks to all the jokes it had and also the ending was pretty ironic because you""ll be the one eating the cake. The ending song was actually amazing, I'm going to download it some time after writing this review. You can solve the puzzles using companion cubes or normal cubes and using your portal gun. The portal gun has two portals a blue one and an orange one and when you pass through one of them you come out of the other one. The controls are not that hard to understand, I barely changed any to my likings. The puzzles get harder each level but there are many useful checkpoints so it makes it not as bad when you die or get stuck.There are a few minor things about this gem but this are just me noticing details while playing along. You can apparantly save when you are dead or about to respawn rather which is not that useful but I accidentally did that when playing. I was dying from drowning in a puzzle and I saved because I wanted to get back another day and it set my checkpoint to that death so it kept respawning me there. I sometime was doubting if I could portal on some wall or floors. There are three colors in this game, walls or floors rather said, those are black, beige and white. But since beige looks a lot like white you weren't sure if you could portal on it.   I'm doubting still why you are taking time reading this, still thankful though, and not buying this game. Even at full price at this moment it isn't a waste of money and don't mind the gametime as there are many bonusmaps and such which I didn't dig into (yet).			"

												A game I just finished roughly in about 2 - 3 hours (the difference being all the ""figuring out"" time), Portal is a game certainly worth owning.This is from a person who blindly bought Portal 2 without any prior knowledge of its earlier surprise success or without the imagination necessary to fathom how ""portal mechanics"" in of itself, without any other additive, be a good game.Though I enjoyed the pacing, character dynamics, and indirect indie movie-like world building in Portal 2 more, going back to see how it all began will help explain particular jokes and flesh out many of GlaDOS's warped programming. If there's one complaint about Portal it's that, yes, it's a bit short even if for $10 but it's not like you aren't gettiing your entertainment/experience value and its chock full of special features for further insight if that's your sorta thing (it is to me!)One complaint that might not bother others but sorta bothered me - again because I'm comparing it to 2 instead of vice versa - is that the game wastes no time piling complexity at you versus in #2 how it could often blend world building and exploration more frequently. It's a case of tight budgeting vs. free property reign but I feel it should be addressed.All in all, Portal again cements Valve's rep at never offering inept neurally challenged games. Believe the hype or challenge it, either way, playing any entry from the series will add something you'll cherish in your life.			"

												Yes we all know how brilliant this game is, so I'll skip all that and cut right to the critical points. This game is a little on the short side, but the content is still really good. This game took me longer then most since I had to deal with serious feelings of nausea and motion sickness.  For those considering playing this, if you have issues with motion sickness, consider yourselves warned, since POV changes constantly in some puzzles . All in all I'm very glad that I finally beat it without losing a meal. The song at the end of the game is hysterical. This was a great setup for the much more fleshed out Portal 2.			"

												Portal was one of the games that inspired me to start pursuing a job in the games industry.  Portal is a unique blend of the puzzle, FPS, and (to some extent) first-person platformer genres.The game, for the most part, is a tutorial made into a full game.  This is, however, not a bad thing at all.  The game does its job exceptionally well to ensure the new mechanic, and namesake of the game, Portals, are taught to the player with little room for confusion.  This is an exceptional feat when Portals force players to think differently about the spaces around them, and how to traverse them.Besides enjoyable puzzles and interesting environments to explore, the game employs GLaDOS, effectively the narrator of the game, to serve as a means of adding dark comedy to the mix.  GLaDOS's unique sense of humor makes players want to continue through the game to discover both the secrets of the facility they wake up trapped within, and hear what witty remarks GLaDOS will say next.To conclude, I would recommend Portal to any fans of puzzle games, as well as any fans of FPS or casual games.

												Portal is a unique and mind-bending experience that I am so grateful to have the chance to play. There aren't many people who don't know this game or haven't played it. If you haven't already got this game I urge you to get your card out and buy it straight away. It's a one of a kind and with the sequel being even more astonishing it is definetly worth the money. From the iconic ending, which has one of the most catchiest songs I have ever listened to, to the briliant and hilarious dialogue. It is simply a masterpiece!However, there are times where it can feel a tiny bit repetitive and a bit too hard for most average people like me. But it will never stop you from wanting more and it will never stop you from having a briliant experience.9.5/10Truly one of the greatest games I have ever played.			"

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Portal: This game is probably one of the most innovative titles of the decade. You play as the female protagonist named Chell. In the beginning of the game, Chell awakes inside of a glass room. A radio playing some upbeat music is the only noise heard until an eerie voice from the Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System (GLaDOS) fills the air. GLaDOS informs Chell about some very valuable tests that need to be performedPortal is a pure surprise of enjoyment. you will get hooked on this game wishing for more by the end. and this game opens up the door for future implementation in valve games that should be very fun.Portal is still revolutionary. The challenging puzzles and clever dialog are beautifully mixed together. Plus, the fact that you're able to reach each goal using different methods truly makes the game personal and memorable for each person.			"

Portal					* 9/10I need a companion Cube.Portal looks like a First-Person Puzzle Game with the good old Half-Life 2 Source Engine, but it's more than that. We're Chell, a girl used as guinea pig forced to do tests for an artificial intelligence called GLaDos with a portal gun inside this gigantic and apparently deserted structure named Aperture Science Labs. The puzzles you will be prompted to solve involve the use of the portal gun, a gun that shoots two linking portals on specific typologies of walls and, you must complete every test where you might have to push a button, drop cubes, make huge leaps with the help of the portals and a clever use of physics and gravity.Seems simple and effective but what's so special in this game? Well, besides the clever puzzles you can't ignore the ourageously and funny GLaDos, with her sarcastic comments and black humour that will keep on encouraging you in doing tests for her while at the same time insulting you. Exhilarating.The interesting fact is the minimalistic story behind the game. Portal is set in the same ""universe"" of Half-Life 2, but the time is not specified. Anyways it's interesting to notice the small clues around the maps, the small hints and stories told by GLaDos to understand a little what's going on, why are we here and what happened to the Aperture Science Labs.Unfortunately a very big problem of the game is it's length, it just take less than a fistful hours to fully complete it, but believe me it's really worth it.+++PROs+++ PORTAL. Very innovative and creative puzzles. I love the portal gun and it's being used in every possible way pushing the player to make a very attentive use with the aid of physics. GLaDos. Her artificial sarcasm alone is definitely a reason good enough to play.---CONs--- LENGHT. It's Short. Very short... Too Short "

I invited your best friend, the Companion Cube. Of course, he couldn't come, because you murdered him. All your other friends couldn't come either, because you don't have any other friends. Because of how unlikeable you are. It says so here in your personnel file: unlikeable. Liked by no one. A bitter, unlikeable loner whose passing shall not be mourned. ""Shall not be mourned."" That's exactly what it says. Very formal. Very official. It also says you were adopted. So that's funny too.F**k, just for the monologue of the AI, I'd play this game again a thousand times =P.The only con: too short ! I finished the game in 3 hours (bonus maps excluded), I want more ! =D.Every steam library should own this game (get Portal 2 as well if you can). ^.^I'll finish by saying... the cake is not a lie !

												After completing the game over four times, and doing the majority of things in Portal, I think I’m ready to review the game. So, Portal is a puzzle-platform game, developed by Valve, and as you cleverly-observed from the title ‘Portal’ there are… Portals, to help you pass each test chamber (best synopsis ever). Thus, I shall just jump straight into the review, which has been split into ‘different sections’ before giving my overall score and final opinions. Story  –The game has quite a simplistic story – the protagonist (Chell) has to navigate through a total of nineteen test-chambers with her Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or simply the ‘portal gun’. She is essentially a lab-rat for GLaDOS, who is an artificial intelligence that would guide and monitor the player. I won’t say any more than that, as it does get quite interesting by the end of the game. When I played through the game for the first time, it took me about three to four hours to complete with that time getting shorter and shorter as I knew how to get through each level, but there was never a point where I felt I paid far too much for the game, and I felt that the game’s length suited the value.  Gameplay  –Obviously, throughout this game you use portals. At the start, you can shoot blue portals before obtaining the ability to shoot orange portals as well. This concept was clearly reused by the game ‘Narbacular Drop’; I believe the people who made that game also joined Valve in making Portal. This idea was interesting enough on its own, for a short game, but they added a few more mechanics such as the Weighted Companion Cube coming into play, or the usage of speed benefitting you in quite a few puzzles. And I liked how Portal applies physics to each of its puzzles, thus making each solution seem more logical (well as logical as portals existing anyway). Of course, it’s nowhere near as in-depth as a handful of gameplay mechanics that has been introduced in the game’s sequel – Portal 2, yet because of the game’s length and style, it holds on its own and I never felt bored by the simple gameplay.  Replayability  –After completing the game, there are further options to lengthen your gameplay-time such as attempting the Advanced Maps, which are quite challenging and they are pretty much just harder versions of existing maps you’ve already done in the original game. There’s also Portal Challenges which involves you trying to beat a puzzle with the least amount of portals, least amount of steps or the fastest time possible (however as of yet, I haven’t tried this option). But aside of trying to claim achievements, finding Easter eggs, finding different ways to do the same puzzle or attempting speed-runs of the game (I managed to complete the game at around 2.1 hours on my last attempt), there is very little reason to actually run through the game beyond a second, or even third time. Yet, even then, I still feel like this game is worth your money and your play-time may reach five-seven hours, if you disregard achievement-hunting or other activities within the game. Overall  – This is a relatively shorter review, than to my first one, which suits the relatively shorter game (despite twenty hours of playtime) but honestly, this game must be acknowledged for its gameplay, its humour as well as its difficulty – as I have to say that the last four to six test-chambers do a good job of challenging you initially and there were fond moments, where I stopped and thought “Oh!!! That’s how you… …damn.”, after wasting  length proportion dying and head-scratching. I can honestly say that this game was a memorable experience for me, when I first bought it a couple of months ago, and it is as fun and enjoyable as it is now, with me now having fond memories of many different sections within this game. I must recommend this game to all, as this is a great game with many great qualities and almost no flaws aside of length (which is not even a major problem for me). Therefore, I’m giving the game an  8/10  and I would highly recommend people to buy it whether you are ok with the price, or whether you wish to buy the Portal Bundle on sale (Portal 1 + 2) for a relatively cheap price, it’s up to you. Thanks for reading my review! My Scoreboard  –1/10 ---> 4/10 – Not worth it.5/10 ---> 6/10 – Below Average/Mediocre.7/10 – Above Average. 8/10 – Great. 9/10 ---> 10/10 – Outstanding + Must Own.			"

This review article analyzes the tone and design of the excellent single-player campaigns in Portal and Portal 2, concluding that the original Portal is the stronger title.[. . .] I think it’s fairly trivial to say that Portal is a significant and influential franchise. In fact, I would go so far as to say that the original Portal is such a cohesive, nearly flawless gaming experience that it should be remembered alongside the other highest-tier encapsulations of solid game design and execution.

+ Very fun and unique gameplay. You receive a Portal Gun which lets you create two portals that you can pass through at any angle to get to various out of reach places or to quickly navigate from one place to another.  You can even use your momentum from falling to slingshot yourself across a stage by placing portals beneath you.+ The puzzles are challenging but not ""too difficult"".  Most consist of getting from point A to B, some require you to move cubes on top of buttons to open doors. Others require you to redirect energy balls with your portal gun to activate various switches.  These puzzles continue to get more difficult as you get near the end by including obstacles like turrets but the game really makes you think outside the box.+ I personally feel like the story is what makes Portal ""great"" especially near the end of the game where you are trying to escape from the facility + GLaDOS the robot governing the facility makes a lot of funny jokes and remarks throughout the entire game which keeps things interesting and enjoyable. + Quite a few easter egg type rooms with some humerous drawings and writing+ The ending is fantastic which involves an awesome boss fight, lots of craziness, cake, and the best credits song I've ever heard. :)- Some levels (especially in the second half of the game) are a bit too lengthly and sometimes feel a bit overwhelming. It took me many years to finally have the willpower to push myself to get past them and finish the game. (In 2016 lol)- I felt like some parts of the game were a bit unclear...a new player can find themselves getting lost or stuck for quite a long time without using a guide. I did not use any guides on my playthrough and struggled during various parts, often thinking ""uhh....that can't be right..."" or ""umm...what do I do now?""   Be prepared to get stuck multiple times on your first playthrough.			"

												The concept is simple but brilliant: you're trapped in the labs of Aperture Science and you have to get out. To assist you you're given a portal gun. The gun opens doorways in almost any surface. Once you have full control of the gun you can create blue and amber portals. Step into the blue one and you emerge from the amber one, step into the amber one and you emerge from the blue one. By positioning the portals in certain ways you can step, jump, or fall huge distances. You can also use them to redirect lasers and bullets, which you must do in order to stay alive, although the game can be completed within a few hours, and the scenery is quite sparse. Nearly everything that GLaDOS says is absolutely hilarious, and the challenges are fun and really challenge you to think. Additionally, they can be completed in several different ways and it is possible to pick up awards for doing certain things, so the game can easily be replayed with great satisfaction.			"

												It may be short, but boy is it sweet. Portal is one of those rare, perfect games.Playing through Portal, you'll be treated to delightfully subversive dark humor, which slowly gives way to a creepy, sinister atmosphere. The gameplay is rock-solid, too - challenging, but not unfair to the player. And without spoiling anything I can tell you that Portal has one of the best video game characters this side of 2000.Long after you've finished it, this game will stick with you.			"

												Portal, while short, provides a very memorable experience and is well crafted in all aspects of the game.    The levels in Portal often use verticality and gravity to make a more fun experience.  The core mechanic of Portal is the Portal Gun, which creates two linked portals.  Turrets, moving platforms, deadly water, and weighted cubes can often serve as both obstacles and tools in a level.  The way in which portals can conserve energy and create gravity defying feats can be difficult to imagine, but is extremely satisfying.	The graphics are from many years ago, and they can’t be compared to any recent games, but they look good enough.  The visual design of the entire game doesn’t require or would benefit from extra detail.  After all, you’re in an industrial-looking testing facility.	The main story focuses on the silent Chell and GLaDOS within the Aperture Science facility.  You play from the first person perspective of Chell, navigating through and solving puzzles in the facility.  I won’t spoil anything else.  	The main storyline lasts under four hours, but the voice acting and use of dark humor is superb, and something rare in the puzzle genre.  There are also many bonus levels in addition to the regular ones.  The low price, low hardware requirements, replayability, and how fun it is overall make it necessary for any collection.  Should you play this game?Yes:  -If you’re new to puzzle games, the shortness and low price make it a great introduction to the genre.-If you have played Portal 2, and you liked it, or you like puzzle games in general.-If you don’t want a frustrating or drawn-out puzzle game.No:-If you want a very lengthy game.

Welcome to the Enrichment Center(Sorry, but we've run out of cake-related jokes.)TL;DR:A strange puzzle game that proves a challenging experience eventually brings you deeper into the lore of Aperture Science, starting otherwise innocuous and weird and showing a more sinister side to the events taking place in the game; a fairly enjoyable game with a great sequel and setting. Having its eerie sci-fi elements, this first person, physics-based puzzle game is the spin-off series to Half-Life, taking place in the same universe.OverviewAn overall instant classic, Portal is a first-person puzzle game taking place in the Aperture Science laboratories; the Computer-Aided Enrichment Center. You are a test subject given the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device to participate in the physics experiment through the test course, passing through challenges involving diverse testing elements and techniques to solve the puzzle chambers.PlotThe story begins with a test subject, ""Chell"", being released from a state of suspension in the beginning of a test course in the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Center. She is introduced to the Portal technology and the Handheld Portal Device during the course of the tests, which start otherwise weird, but seemingly innocuous. The story progresses revealing a darker side to the testing course and the whole Enrichment Center.While relatively shallow, the plot of the original Portal game has a certain degree of paranoia fuel and space for imagination of what's manipulating the experiment and the nature of the Enrichment Center. Combined with further content ('Lab Rat' comic, among others), the game lore is carried forward and somewhat explained of how it fits within the Half-Life universe, leading into the events of the sequel.GameplayPlaying Portal on the first time can be admittedly disorienting, but the player progressively adapts to the puzzling nature of the portals and the Device throughout the test chambers. Dealing with test elements such as moving platforms, high-energy pellets, AI turrets and acid pits, each chamber is challenging in its own manner.You can also try the extra challenges in the game for bragging rights and achievements.GraphicsDecent level of detail for a puzzle game, and low performance requirements make this game worth a try for even older machines. Source Engine's versatility remains true in Portal.Music and SoundThe soundtrack of Kelly Bailey, composer of the Half-Life series has the uncanny feeling of both sinister, outworldish experience that Aperture Science becomes to the player, helping the immersion into the strange world of Aperture.The sound effects in the game are fitting to the setting, mainly consisting of sci-fi noises and mechanical machinery.ConclusionWorth a buy if you're into puzzle games or are looking to complete your Valve collection, adds to some story value for the sequel, and is interesting overall. Unsure? Try the demo, it'll give you a sample of what the game might feature.			"

												Portal Review - Raymond KTI originally played Portal 2 before the first one, since I was only playing 360 games at the time and didn’t own my personal PC yet. But I’m glad I waited, I would not have been able to see the brilliant art  the game presents in a unique fashion. Portal uses a concept that's a bit hard to wrap your head around without actually seeing it in action. The only ""weapon"" you're given is a portal gun that can shoot a portal entrance with the right mouse button and a portal exit with the left mouse button. Once both portals have been placed, you can walk through the entrance and find yourself at the exit. Walk through the exit and you're back at the entrance.			"

The Cake is a lie. 9/10 I loved this game, I thought it was amazing, I feel that everyone should play this game because it is extremely fun. This game is the best deal that any gamer can find anywhere. This game has a fun concept, where you solve a series of puzzle chambers using a portal gun which allows you to create two portals that you can then walk through or send objects through to solve puzzles.There is an interesting story to the game, and you will hear this story as you pass through the game, and find new areas. It isn't anything expansive, but it's enough to keep interest.The single best thing about this game is Glados. Glados is a really annoying, and funny ♥♥♥♥♥ that talks to you throughout the entire game, always trying to patronize and put you down. Being able to listen to Glados is enough to buy the game itself. And while I always have a soft spot for her, I will never forgive her for Companion Cube. Seriously, if you don't find Glados' dark sense of humour funny, you have no soul.The puzzles are clever, and fun, but when you figure out what to do, there is no actual difficulty to them. The story can be finished in 1.5-4 hours, depending on how long you spend on the puzzles, and whether you go quickly through the game, or enjoy the experience. There is no need to speed through the game though, I'm not sure why people think they have to speed through every game these days.  And there are also challenge modes that extend the gameplay time past the story, and they worth it.The game doesn't appear outdated despite it's age, this is a game that can pretty much be enjoyed by everyone, and if you're worried about it ending, remember there's Portal 2 which is a huge expansion of this game, with a lot of content. I recommend playing this game, and then portal 2. However if you've already played Portal 2, I recommend getting this game anyway because you will still enjoy it, and both games aren't the exact same.			"

												Portal is a first person puzzle game, where you must traverse various levels, and use a portal gun to create portals, in order to overcome obstacles. Without giving any of the plot away, I will say this is a very fun, albiet easy game to master. It has memorable lines, seen in popular culture today, and spawned a sequel, Portal 2. If you enjoy puzzle solving games then you should give portal a playthrough.			"

												A shiny, inventine look at puzzle games.  Portal is a really good game, but I don't feel as if it lives up to the hype surrounding it.  With that being said, it's worth buying to play one time through, especially due to it being on sale all the time.			"

												Portal was my first experience with a puzzle game. Initially, I didn’t like it very much. I found it a bit boring and I felt locked up in this environment, unable to explore. Only after my third attempt to get back to the game I realized I was approaching it with the wrong perspective. I changed my attitude and decided to roleplay the character. It became a puzzle, horror, comedy world for me and I love it. The visuals are great for its time, the physics are well implemented and the puzzles were just hard enough to push me to beat them all. It took me less than ten hours to complete the game, but I enjoyed my frustration, discovery and success moments equally. I’m looking forward for the sequel.			"

												At the time this review is being written, the game is now around 8 and a half years old, and still looks STUNNING! The storyline, in my opinion, is fantastic, and there are plenty of fan theories about it that can be found by a simple Google search. The price des this game justice. The testchambers are put together in progressive difficulty, and the escape is one of my best moments on gaming, although I do play mostly simulators, so there may be better ones.You need logic in this game, think outside the box, but not too far outside the box. I'd also take the things GLaDOS says with a pinch of salt, maily because she is very sarcastic. Need more persuasion, read the other 24, 516 positive reviews. Just BUY IT! NOW! IT'S MANDATORY!			"

The starting setup looks so simple, but the game builds up to its plot in an intriguing way. It drags you along and somehow manages to play with your feelings (it has succeeded to make me care for a cube :p2cube: ).  Pros:- Good story, built up very well- Funny, witty voice acting- Interesting puzzle challenges- Even the enemy turrets in this game are adorable :3- Has cakeCons:- Limited to the story line (does contain additional extras, but only a few)- That poor companion cube D':All in all a great game!

Then I saw my portal weapon in completely different way and I started to be excited.Maybe it is a pity that there are only 19 levels + bonus in escape, but not only the final chamber was really challenging for my sensorium together with my portal skills.Conclusion: It IS worth playing.

												Calling Portal a breath of fresh air is a huge understatement. Mixing puzzle gameplay, fantastic dialog, and the sadistic yet lovable frenemy GLaDOS, it is easily one of my favorite new IPs in years. Though it starts out simple enough, Valve is quick to remind you of how incredibly smart and inovative they are. Portals begin being used in all sorts of ways I'd never have thought of, and yet it's never the least bit overwhelming or overly challenging. Solving the puzzles is great fun, but it's really the dialog that stands out. This is hands down some of the best writing I've heard in a video game, and it's delivery is marvelous.Graphically it might not be the most technically impressive, but it's simple visual scheme is all it's own, and even the most mundane objects become memorable. To me this is absolutely a must play for each and everyone out there that calls themselves a gamer. It's charming, clever, and left me longing for more!			"

The puzzles are jam packed full of fun and figuring out how to finally complete that one level really does give you a sense of accomplishment. It's quite short but was great while it lasted and after completing the game you can test your skills on the bonus advanced and challenge maps which reuses the same levels but with added components to make the experience more challenging. Valve has once again made a great game and it only gets better for Portal from here on. ;)			"

Portal ReviewFPS puzzle game with aspects of humour.Portal is an absolute classic, it's sequel even better. The storyline is perfect, little bits of humour, puzzle, action, even some mysterious horror. You play as Chell, a completely mute human who is the only person known to have survived the events prior, where the scientists at Aperture Laboratries all got poisoned by GLaDOS, a robot they had built, which went insane. Now GLaDOS uses you as her guinea pig and puts you through a vast amount of tests, each one solvable using the famous Portal Gun and the many contraptions available in the particular testchamber. This game is surely one of my favorite games. If you're a Half Life fan as well, there's a few mentions of Black Mesa and the Borealis in this game so it's worthwhile getting.The sequel kind of tops this game in my opinion, but that's because I really like storyline and Portal 2 has that plus a bunch of comedic dialogue from some really interesting and charismatic characters.

												 Portal was released in 2007, it had many noticable flaws and the team who worked on portal had years to improve the game thus creating portal 2. Since I played portal 2 before I got the chance to play this it may have clouded my judgement, I do  however think it would be a great game if you haven't played the second one this is a fairly short game, it can be beat it in less then half an hour, if you've played portal 2 already and you want to play the first one it's not really worth it, but if you haven't played either I do recommened playing this one first.

Introduction: A completely original and innovative game!If you have a passion for sci-fi, and enjoy solving puzzles, this first person experience is exactly what you're looking for! Portal takes place at the heart of the Aperture Enrichment Center, where the test subject is united with her trusty companion cube and Handheld Portal Device in the name of science. There are 19 test chambers altogether.Story: While the story itself might be a bit bare, there is plenty food for thought, and suggestive twisted backstory regarding Aperture. It all begins in the Relaxation Vault, where the test subject first comes into contact with the Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System (further referred to as GLaDOS), and is then educated on how to use the portal gun. With GLaDOS as your guide, what could possibly go wrong? After all, nobody else is as familiar with the Aperture Laboratories as the artificial intelligence that oversees seemingly all of Aperture's scientific experiments. Much of the story is best left unsaid, so I put the rest in spoiler tags.It isn't long before the character will stumble over various forms of warnings, from an unseen individual, warning her about the facility... More importantly, her guide. With this in mind, the character dynamics shift, and her task becomes clear: She must escape a laboratory otherwise devoid of human life.Gameplay: Covering the basics: A complete portal consists of both an exit and entrance. Throughout the game, the character will acquire two extremely important pieces of equipment, which will enable her to create a complete portal. Initially, she will not be able to make a portal by herself, which forces her to rely on various forms of equipment littering the early chambers of the facility on her journey to the first gun. Only when the blue gun is acquired, can she unlock the ability to make half of the portal for herself. Soon after, she will be in possession of both portals, which is where the real fun begins.With both halves of the portal, the options become endless. The character could essentially jump or fall forever. Regardless, the game offers a lot of content for beginners and advanced players alike. Regardless, the game is highly addictive, and will leave the player with a desire for more. If this is your first puzzle game, don't give up! Once you get the hang of the game mechanics, clearing the game will be a cinch. I promise. The theme provides a perfect balance between creepy and mysterious, leaving the player in suspense. Yet, the best feature is easily the dialogue of GLaDOS which sporadically plays through the game. I think my only complaint is that the game is so short, but not to worry, there's a sequel. =)Controls: I found the controls to be a little bit tricky at first, but they were something that grew on me with a bit of practice. The game is compatible with the XBOX 360 controller, if you have it installed to your computer, however I stand by my initial statement: Default controls are a bit tricky, but something that the player will easily pick up with a little bit of patience. I can't really complain too much about the controls in Portal.Graphics: Aesthetically, Portal felt a little bland to me, but the overall effect fits its story perfectly. Sleek, and defined, the visual appearance does its job. On a very rare occasion, you might run into small graphics glitches, but it is nothing to worry about.Sound: I, for one, really freaking love the voice of GLAdOS. The amount of humour that she presents to the game is astonishing on its own, and really distracted me from being able to give a solid opinion about the otherwise subtle sounds of Portal. Replay Value: Definitely a game that can be played multiple times! Portal is genius, and if you don't love GLaDOS (or Portal) within a few hours, I myself will question your humanity... Not to mention there will be no cake for you!“Thank you for helping us help you help us all.” -GLaDOS "

												When I first played this I had no idea what it was. Unfortunately, that's nearly impossible to experience now that it is so heavily hyped. Fortunately, the hype is well earned.This is an innovative game that only proves further how amazing Valve is at reinventing genres. It's puzzle, platformer, FPS, and with a hilarious and unique story that you will love. This first game is a bit short, but the Challenges and Time Trials offer plenty of replay value.Much like anything by Valve, if you don't have this already, you must grab it.			"

												Portal is my favorite game of all time, uncontested. I've completed it about 12 times. It's definitly the smartest game ever created, but it's also very short. I like this game much better than I like Portal 2. Portal 2 was almost a comedy game, while Portal 1 is more ambient and dark, and in the last four test chambers  the Ratman Dens makes it feel sort of a horror game, and soundtracks like Self Esteem Fund really makes it feel like you're alone. I had to take a walk after I played the game for my first time, just to see people again. I love this game and I'd really like Portal 3 if/when it comes out to be more like Portal 1 than Portal 2. Don't get me wrong, Portal 2 is an awesome game, but Portal 1 remains the better game. If you've never played this, give it a go, and if you've already beaten it, go play it again!			"

												Portal was, in short; short. It taught you how to play the game through a series of levels, and when you were finally trained, the game ended. It was much too easy and lacked much intellect. This game was the preparation of what would be the greatest puzzle video game of all-time (Portal 2). It needed to be the first, so that every flaw in it would be ironed out by the time of Portal 2. Even after all these insults, it was still amazing. It was very funny, had a new and interesting concept behind it, it was quotable, and best of all, memorable.			"

												The cake is a lie! However, the hype behind Portal is not.  When I first installed this game, years ago, I was too young and too impatient to appreciate the nuanced and intellectual puzzles that are the heart of the gameplay of this title.  If you take a little time, you'll find something very original and stimulating, and funny.   If you don't like to get frustrated, or if you are the type that gives up easily on a puzzle and searches for the answer...you won't find this game to be fun.If you have the patience to inspect, re-inspect, and re-re-inspect a room for that one puzzle element you missed, or didn't think about, and you have the wish to be rewarded and have the ""EUREKA!"" moment when you finally realize that bit of wall hanging at an odd angle isn't there just for show...and you, in fact, have to teleport in a loop of gravitational frenzy to catapult yourself from said wall across an impossible chasm into the hands of awaiting freedom (not), then you'll love it!  It's all about the intelligence.  Artificial, or otherwise.			"

Shortcake - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]The FPS genre has been enjoying its golden age for quite a while. Even after, arguably, its decline from its supposed golden age. Sure, many of the greatest games of the past generation or so have been shooters. Call of Duty and Battlefield have become juggernaut franchises, and many smaller shooters have really fleshed out what's possible in the genre. Games like Bioshock or Borderlands have found their own niches within the FPS family, and have had some pretty spectacular installments. But what about all of the, you know, not stellar shooters?I'm sorry to break it to you, but not every shooter that's come out within the past decade has been good. And just because they're selling by the ♥♥♥-ton, doesn't mean that they're particularly amazing. If sales meant quality, people wouldn't buy those ♥♥♥♥♥♥-♥♥♥ RoseArt crayons, MOM.Many shooters refuse to push the limits of the genre. Many don't even acknowledge that there are any limits left to break. It's become a tired, overused genre. The creativity has become much more stagnated than what it used to be. But that doesn't mean there's no hope.There has always been people willing to change. People willing to be creative. Large game developers have no interest in what's interesting or what's creative, they want what will resonate with the masses and earn them their profits. All that glitters is gold.But only shooting stars break the mold.One of these mold-breaking stars is quite famous actually. As it should be. It's a fantastic game, and a show that any genre can be completely broken by such a simple idea. All it really takes is a bit of creativity and a bit of genius.And a bit of cake.Yeah, it's Portal! Nothing quite turned the FPS genre on its head the way Portal did. Portal was brilliant in its way of taking a genre known mostly for guns, shooting, war, and death... and adding cake.Portal is not a shooter. It's first-person. You definitely have some kind of gun. And you do shoot it. But it's not a shooter. Portal is a first-person puzzle adventure. With the power of your portal gun, which can create portals that instantly link one area to another, you must make it through your rigorous testing. You'll be put through a series of puzzles, and with the help of your trusty portal gun, you may just not die.Apple has kidnapped you so that Steve Jobs could jerk off to your surveillance footage. But that's illegal, so you're actually an unpaid intern/test subject. Which is technically legal.Portal's level design is incredibly smart. Each level will steadily introduce and reinvent gameplay elements. There's always something new. A new obstacle, a new way to use your gun, or even a way to use something you already knew of in a way you hadn't thought. And it's all in such a natural, intuitive way. There's no lengthy tutorial to read through or anything. All of the learning is through doing.And it's not just smart in a mechanical, gameplay way. The level design is aesthetically pleasing, and delivers some powerful atmosphere. Portal is a first-person puzzle game, and yet when ♥♥♥♥ got real it's given me chills the way a horror game might. The ambiance and juxtaposition are executed wonderfully, and in such an unexpected way.Portal is just pleasing in design on every level.Except one.See, Portal is kind of like your very first handjob back in middle school.The build-up is great, and it's so amazing, but it's over before you even realize that it ended.Took me about an hour and a half to finish.And Portal was like two hours to finish.Pretty quick. As I was playing, I actually thought I was playing through the first area of the game. And that there would be more areas after. But nope, that theory kinda went out the window after the credits rolled. I got it for about a dollar during a sale, so I wasn't particularly off-put by that. If I'd spent a lot more, I'd probably be somewhat upset. And I can say I was just a little disappointed by how abrupt the ending seemed. But for a dollar or two, I can definitely say it was worth it.But hey, it might be kinda short. But, you know, Portal is a hilarious game. The writing is superb, and it's gotten some genuine laughs out of me. So don't go putting it down just because it doesn't last long. Portal is a very nice game that will treat you right and make you laugh. Isn't that the game everyone wants? On the outside, at least? I mean, it's okay if you really want something longer, stronger, and gorgeously attractive. But you can't say those kinds of things out loud. People would judge you.I'm judging you right now.			"

												This game is very awesome. Seriously how can anyone not like this. Besically, the story goes like this:You play as Chell, a silent but determined test subject who is trapped in Aperture Science. The facility is run by a psychotic AI named GLaDOS(Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) who makes Chell go through some deadly tests involving a gun that shoots portals(the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, or as I like to call it ""ASHPoD""). They're easy as first, but as you progress they get harder. During testing, GLaDOS promises Chell things like cake and grief counseling. However, after Chell discovers some graffitti revealing the AI's true intentions, Chell is skeptical of this so called ""reward"". After dodging adorable but deadly turrets, flinging through portals, and incinerating a cute box, you finally make it to the last test chamber. I would tell you what happens after that, but I don't want to spoil the surprise. Portal has a great storyling, great characters, great graphics, and amazing gameplay. I definetly recommend this.

												What more can be said about Portal that hasn't already been said? There have been other FPS games that had great puzzles within. For example, the physics engine that Valve built into Source were a big part of what made HL2 feel so fresh and new in 2004. It allowed for a new type of game puzzle - one based purely on mundane real-world puzzle solving. But Portal 2 takes that formula, and with one introduction (Portals), and one reduction (almost no adrenaline action), turns FPS into FPPP: First-person physics puzzler. But the puzzles alone aren't what make Portal great. The pacing is perfect. The humor is dry and laugh-out-loud funny (tip: turn on the captions). But Portal's crowning achievement is its ability to make a player feel like a genius when he or she figures out the puzzles. The ""a ha"" moments are a pure endorphine tidal wave.If you haven't played Portal yet, what are you waiting for?			"

Shortcake - An Official Waffle King Review~Find more here.[lordwaffleking.com]The FPS genre has been enjoying its golden age for quite a while. Even after, arguably, its decline from its supposed golden age. Sure, many of the greatest games of the past generation or so have been shooters. Call of Duty and Battlefield have become juggernaut franchises, and many smaller shooters have really fleshed out what's possible in the genre. Games like Bioshock or Borderlands have found their own niches within the FPS family, and have had some pretty spectacular installments. But what about all of the, you know, not stellar shooters?I'm sorry to break it to you, but not every shooter that's come out within the past decade has been good. And just because they're selling by the ♥♥♥-ton, doesn't mean that they're particularly amazing. If sales meant quality, people wouldn't buy those ♥♥♥♥♥♥-♥♥♥ RoseArt crayons, MOM.Many shooters refuse to push the limits of the genre. Many don't even acknowledge that there are any limits left to break. It's become a tired, overused genre. The creativity has become much more stagnated than what it used to be. But that doesn't mean there's no hope.There has always been people willing to change. People willing to be creative. Large game developers have no interest in what's interesting or what's creative, they want what will resonate with the masses and earn them their profits. All that glitters is gold.But only shooting stars break the mold.One of these mold-breaking stars is quite famous actually. As it should be. It's a fantastic game, and a show that any genre can be completely broken by such a simple idea. All it really takes is a bit of creativity and a bit of genius.And a bit of cake.Yeah, it's Portal! Nothing quite turned the FPS genre on its head the way Portal did. Portal was brilliant in its way of taking a genre known mostly for guns, shooting, war, and death... and adding cake.Portal is not a shooter. It's first-person. You definitely have some kind of gun. And you do shoot it. But it's not a shooter. Portal is a first-person puzzle adventure. With the power of your portal gun, which can create portals that instantly link one area to another, you must make it through your rigorous testing. You'll be put through a series of puzzles, and with the help of your trusty portal gun, you may just not die.Apple has kidnapped you so that Steve Jobs could jerk off to your surveillance footage. But that's illegal, so you're actually an unpaid intern/test subject. Which is technically legal.Portal's level design is incredibly smart. Each level will steadily introduce and reinvent gameplay elements. There's always something new. A new obstacle, a new way to use your gun, or even a way to use something you already knew of in a way you hadn't thought. And it's all in such a natural, intuitive way. There's no lengthy tutorial to read through or anything. All of the learning is through doing.And it's not just smart in a mechanical, gameplay way. The level design is aesthetically pleasing, and delivers some powerful atmosphere. Portal is a first-person puzzle game, and yet when ♥♥♥♥ got real it's given me chills the way a horror game might. The ambiance and juxtaposition are executed wonderfully, and in such an unexpected way.Portal is just pleasing in design on every level.Except one.See, Portal is kind of like your very first handjob back in middle school.The build-up is great, and it's so amazing, but it's over before you even realize that it ended.Took me about an hour and a half to finish.And Portal was like two hours to finish.Pretty quick. As I was playing, I actually thought I was playing through the first area of the game. And that there would be more areas after. But nope, that theory kinda went out the window after the credits rolled. I got it for about a dollar during a sale, so I wasn't particularly off-put by that. If I'd spent a lot more, I'd probably be somewhat upset. And I can say I was just a little disappointed by how abrupt the ending seemed. But for a dollar or two, I can definitely say it was worth it.But hey, it might be kinda short. But, you know, Portal is a hilarious game. The writing is superb, and it's gotten some genuine laughs out of me. So don't go putting it down just because it doesn't last long. Portal is a very nice game that will treat you right and make you laugh. Isn't that the game everyone wants? On the outside, at least? I mean, it's okay if you really want something longer, stronger, and gorgeously attractive. But you can't say those kinds of things out loud. People would judge you.I'm judging you right now.			"

												I loved this game, I thought it was amazing, I feel that everyone should play this game because it is extremely fun. This game is the best deal that any gamer can find anywhere. This game has a fun concept, where you solve a series of puzzle chambers using a portal gun which allows you to create two portals that you can then walk through or send objects through to solve puzzles.There is an interesting story to the game, and you will hear this story as you pass through the game, and find new areas. It isn't anything expansive, but it's enough to keep interest.The single best thing about this game is Glados. Glados is a really annoying, and funny ♥♥♥♥♥ that talks to you throughout the entire game, always trying to patronize and put you down. Being able to listen to Glados is enough to buy the game itself. And while I always have a soft spot for her, I will never forgive her for Companion Cube. Seriously, if you don't find Glados' dark sense of humour funny, you have no soul.The puzzles are clever, and fun, but when you figure out what to do, there is no actual difficulty to them. The story can be finished in 1.5-4 hours, depending on how long you spend on the puzzles, and whether you go quickly through the game, or enjoy the experience. There is no need to speed through the game though, I'm not sure why people think they have to speed through every game these days. And there are also challenge modes that extend the gameplay time past the story, and they worth it.The game doesn't appear outdated despite it's age, this is a game that can pretty much be enjoyed by everyone, and if you're worried about it ending, remember there's Portal 2 which is a huge expansion of this game, with a lot of content. I recommend playing this game, and then portal 2. However if you've already played Portal 2, I recommend getting this game anyway because you will still enjoy it, and both games aren't the exact same.THE CAKE IS A LIE!!			"

												There's little to be said that the internet hasn't sung praises of for years now.This is very clearly a recommended title, but when I finally got around to playing it I found it wasn't just because of the excellent main gimmick, the interesting world built mostly on contextual information or even the amazing GlaDOS narrating your entire experience and singing the credits music.Those things did not surprise me.What surprised me was how solid a puzzle game it is. After the first dozen or so puzzles introduce everything you need to know about your by-then acquired Portal Gun you're let loose on the rest of the game with very little further guidance and this is where the game really shone for me.I felt great making my way through, figuring out ways to get through or around the obstacles put in my way.Heartily recommended, for more than just the obvious reasons.

The puzzles aren't too hard that they're not fun, but they're challenging to the point of addiction. Well thought out, too. It's just the perfect length overall to not be too much of a drag, which makes you want more (a reason why Portal 2 is awesome) and so you don't get bored.I'd recommend this for anyone, but maybe not very young children, and only small children playing with an adult to help out.

												/ Don't believe anything they tell you about the cake. It's a lie. /This game definitely is a must-have. One of the best games I've played so far. I really enjoyed (and still enjoy) playing this. It's a game everyone could enjoy, in my opinion. The storyline itself took me about 2 to 3 hours to complete. The additional challenges and advanced chambers are nice features, great for adding some game time and a challenge for those who like getting all achievements.The chambers and puzzles get harder smoothly as you advance through the game.  However, it can get a tiny bit repetitive. The portal mechanism really makes this game unique. I really love the smooth physics. Good graphics. The music and sound are okay. The dialog is simply brilliant and hilarious. Through the game, there are several nice additions (random radios playing the catchy theme song, messages from other test subjects) which caused me to laugh from time to time.Portal 2, the sequel, is in my opinion even better, but you just have to play Portal before you start on the sequel. Together, they're a masterpiece.I highly recommend buying this game. It's definitely worth the money. If it's in sale, do not hesitate and buy it immediately (bonus points if you buy Portal 2 too)!

												Portal review:Having already heard many good things about portal in the form and video reviews and word of mouth, I can confirm that you will not be disappointed. Portal is a challenging physics based game that shows off in the best possible way. Having said that the game isn't very long, having taken about 3:30 hours to finish it. I wasn't, however left unsatisfied. Portal was a simple yet challenging game that really gave me a sense of achievement having completed it. With the addition of bonus maps there is still plenty of work to be done after the main story line is finished.The story line itself is intricately with a lot of hidden secrets that's it is completely up to the player to find, adding another level to the game.All in all a fantastic idea coupled with a fantastic story line.. Making for a fantastic gameMy rating:Length:8/10Gameplay:10/10All round enjoyment:10/10 "

												I enjoyed this game quite a bit. While it isn't long by any means, it isn't supposed to be. Rather, it's supposed to be a game that you can complete within a few hours. Here's a list of some of the things you will encounter/do in Portal within said hours:- Think with portals - Cubes- Incinerators- Buttons- Bigger Buttons- Energy Pellets- Judgemental yet humorous Artificial Intelligence- Remove cameras from walls- Energy Grids- Utilize Newton's Law Of Momentum- Testing- CakeSeriously though, if you are a fan of short yet fun puzzle games, get this one. You will not be disappointed.9/10 (Oh, and great music. Let's not forget that. :3)			"

												Portal is in many ways a strange game. At it's core it's a puzzle game, not something most people would consider mainstream but through a great sense of innovation as well as some truly inspired writing it somehow manages to pull it off.The concept of Portal is simple enough. You progress through a series of rooms. In each room you must get from the entrance to the exit overcoming whatever obstacles and dangers might be in there using nothing but your trusty portal gun. The portal gun, quite simply, ""shoots"" a portal entrance onto a flat surface which allows you to travel through it.This fairly simple concept does get quite a bit more tricky as you progress through the game as moving platforms, lasers, turrets and many other troublesome entities try to stop you.Throughout the game you are accompanied by the sometimes scolding, somethings taunting and sometimes soothing voice of G.L.A.D.O.S. The AI in charge of your training and who might be a little mentally unstable as you'll soon discover. Although G.L.A.D.O.S is the only voice you'll hear in the game she does a fantastic job of keeping your entertained throughout your journey. The humor is some of the best you'll see in a game and the storyline is interesting enough that you'll pay attention to every little tidbit you encounter.The only negative to be mentioned is the very short length of the game that leaves you wanting more. Sadly, the only alternative to replaying the game and pretending to be surprised is the challenges which are fairly boring rinse and repeat because of their extremely unforgiving nature.Portal is a great game and one that any Steam user should have in his library, not just because it's been given away for free to all users not once, but twice. But because it is a truly impressive game experience.			"

THIS GAME SCORES [0 1 | 2 *3*] = ~88% (75%-100%)A great 1st person puzzle game, and a great example of how some glimpses of things behind the scenes can add up to a story with quite desirable emotional content. (That's all I say because spoilers.) Portal's content, graphics, sounds, story, tech deserve a firm thumbs-up with both hands.Portal is a great example of non-Euclidean geometry in a game. You enter a hole in the wall, but you don't end up on the other side of the wall, and even the visual appearance behaves accordingly.OTHER GAMES WITH PORTALS / ""PREY""Narbacular Drop[www.digipen.edu] by Nuclear Monkey Software was the prototype game with user-placeable portals that lead to the creation of Portal, and (most of?) that team ended up on Valve's Portal team. That game is also worth a play.But the first game I know of that used portal technology was Prey[en.wikipedia.org] (2006), a really good 1st person shooter. Incidentally, I bought it for €1 in a German retail store a few days ago (but had played it before; those were the days when you installed a DVD without having to download anything else), so I know that it's sadly not available on Steam.With little config file editing, Prey runs on 1920x1080, at least that's what I set in the file, but what I saw on screen rather looked like 4K for some reason. Maybe it was indeed 4K contrary to my choice because to achieve custom resolutions, you also have to set a screen mode variable, and maybe this leads to the game using desktop resolution.I had to turn off anti-aliasing because the frame-rate was not fluid even though my machine can't be the reason - must be the old engine. Frame-rate is fluid without AA, and I didn't miss the AA, so it probably was indeed 4K.Config file editing allows to set arbitrary FoV.I played a few minutes on Windows 10 with August 2016 anniversary update on a GTX980.So, if you can get your hands on Prey today (2016), you can still play it very well, and it's still a great game. And even though it's the first non-Euclidean-geometry game (that I know of), it's very already very well done.			"

												Portal is a surprise hit. It ended up becoming one of Valve's best games. It's immediately fresh, and is easy to pick up but hard to master. It's such a great game, and is a must own for any PC gamer!Positives- Fresh and original gameplay that uses portals- Surprisingly interesting backstory and characters for such a short story- Good amount of post-story content like challange mode and advanced chambers, which are much harder versions of the story chambers.Negatives- Story is pretty short. I was able to complete it in an hour, but that was because I've beaten the game on 360 twice so I memorized the chambers.SummaryPortal is a bittersweet game. It's short, but so great. It fits in the term ""quality over quantity."" I can easily recommend it!Should you buy it? YES! I recommend buying the Portal bundle that includes Portal 1 and 2, as both games are amazing.My review on Portal 2 "

												They have told me I'd enjoy Portal. In fact, I did. I've never played a puzzle game of this kind, so it was something new for me.The plot is very well done. I wouldn't say it's amazing, but still, it was surprising at every level (or at least every 3 levels)The graphics were really nice despite of when it was released (2007) (In fact, Portal 2 looks almost the same. Almost. Of course, 4 years are noticed)GLaDos (I still don't know where the caps go xD) is the best ""evil"" I've ever seen (well, mostly heard). His sense of humour is unique. As well as its freakin' speech. Really amazing. And the end. Oh, you will love the end.The voice acting was nice too, but, well, GLaDos is the only one who talks. You are mute, I guess, since I didn't hear the main character's voice in the whole game. And the final song, the end song. It's simply amazing, astonishing and wonderful.And the puzzles. There are easy ones. And there are difficult ones. But the average is quite easy. (Still, some of them took me a few minutes more than others)So, there are only pros. Nope. Only one negative thing: is a bit short. Yeah, I finished it in 2,2 h. And I repeated a few puzzles since I died many times. You can say I didn't enjoy the game. But I really did. It's a bit short, that's all. But it's great.I do reccomend this game.9.7/10 (-0,3 for the shortness ;)PD: Written by a non-native english speaker.PD2: I forgot to say that the game it's not worth 7 €. Too short for that price. I reccomend to wait for a sale, huge or normal. I bought it at 1,74€.			"

												Alright, this game is one of my absolute favorites. Somehow, Valve managed to create a first person shooter game, that doesn't involve shooting anyone. The point of the game is to use portals to get from point A to point B, and solve puzzles, all while dodging semi-sentient turrets, deadly goo, lasers, and a highly intelligent power hungry sociopathic narcissist computer with a delusion that the cake is real. overall, I highly recommend this game, and its sequal!Enjoy!                    ~Fibcoa7			"

												Portal is a game that takes a mechanic that has been an interesting concept in video games for a long time and puts some new twists on it. Portal is slow at first when introducing the game and the mechanics, but makes you feel like a wizard at puzzles later in the game. Tactics and intentional exploits make the game sometimes not only have one way to solve a certain puzzle. One thing that I was disappointed with at first was how short the actual main gameplay is. But with other things like the Advanced and Challenge maps, and also the importable bonus maps. The gameplay becomes so much better to give the extra challenge to players that were bored with the original gameplay. This overall makes Portal a great game.			"

												Something about cake and cupcakes or whatever. The cake meme might be the Internet equivalent of a Roman fresco, but this game will forever remain a timeless classic.Portal is a short but sweet first person puzzle game, with great writing, intelligent pacing, and a truly sublime main mechanic that was all the more stunning when it first came out in 2007. It was also one of the 5 titles in the Orange Box collection, which was my personal introduction to Valve games. And it's still good.Advanced levels and level challenges are available once you've finished the main story. There is also rudimentary custom level support (no Steam Workshop here) with plenty of custom levels to be found on the internet.No multiplayer though, and nothing like the gels, lasers and light bridges from Portal 2 - but maybe we don't need those here.Buy this if you like good games and gaming history.

												Portal is one of the best... kinda first-person shooter games out there, without actually shooting any bullets. (Is it a fps? Well, that´s debatable.) The game most certainly is a puzzle game, so your gonna have to use your brain on this one. Portal is a game that will challenge your MIND. So unlike in most games, you have to actually think while playing this... and think ALOT. This kinda challenge can be very tricky in a video game and can easily ruin the gameplay, but the Portal does just the opposite: The gameplay is fun because it´s challenging! The game is just enough difficult to be competitive in a good way, the feeling you get when clearing a difficult level without any help is super rewarding experience! Add this with GlaDOS and a portal gun (which is, let´s be real here: one of the coolest ""weapon"" in a world of gaming) and you have a super joyful, challenging and unique game, that is an absolute must-have jewel in your library.4/5 This game has the best credits i have ever seen			"

												Shakespeare was right when he wrote “to be or not to be,” because that’s generally how I organize my pencils. It works, but I’ve found myself a puzzle game that doesn’t require writing down information. Portal is this game. When I heard Portal was a comedy puzzle game I was incalculably confused, so the game had already carried out its function. But that’s beside the point. I simply didn’t understand the concept. Did the portals make witty comments as you jumped through them or were you just taunted every time you failed a puzzle? Well it turns out I was half right with the latter option. Somebody thought it would be a good idea to transform a woman into a machine and she decided to kill everyone and test the survivors. That would be you. However, she (or is she an it?) likes to make sarcastic remarks every ten seconds. Whether you laugh or not is unimportant because you will laugh.The main idea is that you connect 2 spaces with portals which you can travel through or transport objects through. And you will do this while avoiding apathetic turrets. Nevertheless, you will be pushed on by the incentive of cake; whether it is or isn’t a lie. Puzzle games generally increase your brain power, but I’d say I learned one very important lesson from Portal. If you’re going to turn a woman into a robot who has power over a huge science facility, be sure to choose the right week.			"

												Alright, this game is one of my absolute favorites. Somehow, Valve managed to create a first person shooter game, that doesn't involve shooting anyone.

												One of the best single player games ever (right behind Portal 2). This game is funny, challenging, and has some replayability if you want to go back and try to get gold medals on all the challenges. The main story is short, I beat it in one sitting (around 5 hours I think). I recommend getting this game in a bundle with Portal 2 and playing this first, then playing Portal 2, which is in my opinion the best single player game ever made.			"

												Portal is the first of (currently) two first-person-puzzle game installments set in the laboratory environment of Aperture Science. Main focus of the game is the addition of the ""Portal Gun"", a scientific device that lets the player create interdimensional portals in order to solve a set of mindblowing and deadly puzzle chambers. Evade turrets and acidic pits, push buttons and use boxes to help you. Guide energy and master the mind of the portal.Design & ArtSince the game was created and developed by Valve Software, their ""Source"" engine runs the whole show and pretty good too. Even at the current time of writing this review (and consecutively playing the game again) in 2015, the graphics did not gather any dust and still look good, since the games release eight years ago. The graphics profit from the setting of clean and sterile lab environments, since nothing really needs to be absolutely good looking, everything is just intended to make it feel really bland, cold and unforgiving. This helps immersing into Portal and its mindset: 'You are a labrat, you are the testsubject; we need you to do what we say without any doubt in mind.'I greatly enjoy the whole atmosphere of the game; once you play the game, you are truly feeling alone. It is only you, your thoughts, that crazy computer lady voice that keeps talking to you saying weird stuff and the smooth humming of the machinery that surrounds you. Everything feels very strange and suspicious, you instantly feel doubtful about the situation you are thrown into; a situation that desires to be resolved and discussed about.Overall, the design is very minimalistic, yet very loveable. The portal gun itself, the portals, walls, turrets, everything is designed with love and care, everything is designed to feel sterile and emotionless. These are the only things you are going to see for the duration of the game. Remember, you are a labrat in a cage, you do the tests, until you have lost your value as a subject.ControlsThe game is played from first-person-perspective. If you have played any shooter in the last century, you will know how to control your character in the game and if you do not: Portal offers tooltips at the beginning of the game.Sound & MusicThere isn't much sound to this game, Portal lives from its sterile and clean environment, meaning that most of the time, you will be hearing just the noise of machinery humming away or the cute little speechfiles turrents play, when you cross their sights. Everything seems to be crafted with utmost love and care, even the unregular fade in of random soundtracks feel very nice. The music feels fitting and well made, a soundtrack that could capture your attention for days (and eventually did, for me anyway). Nothing feels interrupting or irritating. The game keeps its sound backdrop as shallow as its intention, one might say.Gameplay You play as a testsubject in a laboratory testsetting. You solve puzzles by using your portal gun to create portals and using gravitational or mechanical forces aswell as your wits. This game really set a new trend in case of puzzle games. I remember playing this game for the first time, it was very hard to adapt to the new premise of me being able to create portals. If you are a dedicated puzzle fan, this game is highly recommendable for you! You are garanteed to have about three to five hours of challenging puzzle solving fun!Additional content next to the main storyline is available in the form of a challenge mode (certain chambers that must be solved under different concitions, e.g. your least amount of portals you can create to get to the end) aswell as advanced maps (chambers, that have been increased in difficulty through some means). That makes another two to four hours of fun (be sure to take breaks though, some of the chambers are just unforgiving!).WeakpointsThere is only one weakpoint in my opinion: I have encountered some people, that did not like the game for its open ending. I can completely agree, the game mostly does a poor job at answering specific questions about it. BUT (very big BUT) it is intended to keep it that way, If you are a person, that favors conclusion over confusion, I hereby warn you about this game. You are intended to be kept in the dark, you are the test subject, everything is kept from you and only shared on a need-to-know basis. Do not play, if you are looking for answers, but if you want to ask questions. It is all just a matter of taste in the end.Concluding ThoughtsThe game, that changed everything. It is absolutely understandable why this game won several prizes and awards for its genuine design and loveable plotline. The mystery and world of Portal is created to make you ask: What is all this testing for? Why am I being tested on? And why am I here in the first place?Portal is a game I can safely recommend to EVERYONE. Yes, the game is that simple and enjoyable. A true game that set a new standard. Whoever came up with the idea and its whole execution should be swimming in adoration and money right now. I am completely content with this game and I enjoy it to this day. Play it. You really should. You're missing out if you don't. So get to it! NOW!			"

												Portal is a game that gets you thinking with portals. You are being tested with portals and you have to solve various puzzles. It's a wonderful game, although it's a short one. It takes around an hour to complete.The graphics don't need to be hyper realistic and actually aren't far off from the sequel of this game, 'Portal 2'.The puzzles aren't the hardest things in the world, and are also often based off of momentum, or to describe it simply, ""speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.""Though, the difficulty of the puzzles doesn't mean you won't die. Some puzzles will cause your death on the first try, but when you finally reach the moment when your mind figures out how to do this certain puzzle, the feeling is simply awesome.There are slight tricks that the robotic AI, GLaDOS says/does, one example is the promise of cake. She says ""You will be baked, and there will be cake"", which basically means that she will attempt to kill you with fire.Those tricks are nice and will cause you to listen to that part again to see if you heard it incorrectly or not. Ultimately, this is quite an exceptional game.Short version: Nice gameplay. Good graphics. Awesome sensations, and neat twists. It's a tad bit short, bit is exceptionally grand. "

												Words cannot describe what I feel for Portal, but since this is is a review I kind of have to so here goes.When I first bought Portal it was the first time I had ever played a game where I was clueless as to what it's main goal was. It got me asking multiple questins: Who was I? Was there a villain? If so what was their intention?Due to my unawareness throughout playing it gave me a slight nervousness and jitteryness within certain chambers.It's atmosphere is unlike any other game I have ever played. I recommend this game to be played with headphones at a moderatley high volume where every footstep and movement can be heard. There were points throughout the game where I genuinly felt alone and disconected from the outside world (but if you're a skyrim or Wow player you already know that feel). This was all due to the games lack of contact that you have with the games narrator who is guiding you throughout the tests. Because of the on and off again dialogue you really get to be alone with your thoughts and it creates a more chilling design whenever you hear the voice of GLaDoS in levels.The gameplay itself was not dissapointing so much as thought provoking, in some first-person games such as CoD your objective is simple; KILL EVERYTHING. In Portal you can sometimes spend a while thinking what your objective is and how to solve the puzzle (however frustrating it may have become)The challenges can become somewhat tedious at points  but that differs from gamer to gamer.If you want an hour or two to kill I recommend this gameIf you want a twenty plus hour game experience I wouldn't steer clear from it but I would prepare myself for what may seem as a quick game.9.5/10Pros:-Brilliant Gameplay and Design-Excellent atmosphereCons:-Challenges can become tedious-Urge to buy Portal 2 even though I am brokeSuper Pro:-End credit song			"

												Portal is the first of (currently) two first-person-puzzle game installments set in the laboratory environment of Aperture Science. Main focus of the game is the addition of the ""Portal Gun"", a scientific device that lets the player create interdimensional portals in order to solve a set of mindblowing and deadly puzzle chambers. Evade turrets and acidic pits, push buttons and use boxes to help you. Guide energy and master the mind of the portal.Design & ArtSince the game was created and developed by Valve Software, their ""Source"" engine runs the whole show and pretty good too. Even at the current time of writing this review (and consecutively playing the game again) in 2015, the graphics did not gather any dust and still look good, since the games release eight years ago. The graphics profit from the setting of clean and sterile lab environments, since nothing really needs to be absolutely good looking, everything is just intended to make it feel really bland, cold and unforgiving. This helps immersing into Portal and its mindset: 'You are a labrat, you are the testsubject; we need you to do what we say without any doubt in mind.'I greatly enjoy the whole atmosphere of the game; once you play the game, you are truly feeling alone. It is only you, your thoughts, that crazy computer lady voice that keeps talking to you saying weird stuff and the smooth humming of the machinery that surrounds you. Everything feels very strange and suspicious, you instantly feel doubtful about the situation you are thrown into; a situation that desires to be resolved and discussed about.Overall, the design is very minimalistic, yet very loveable. The portal gun itself, the portals, walls, turrets, everything is designed with love and care, everything is designed to feel sterile and emotionless. These are the only things you are going to see for the duration of the game. Remember, you are a labrat in a cage, you do the tests, until you have lost your value as a subject.ControlsThe game is played from first-person-perspective. If you have played any shooter in the last century, you will know how to control your character in the game and if you do not: Portal offers tooltips at the beginning of the game.Sound & MusicThere isn't much sound to this game, Portal lives from its sterile and clean environment, meaning that most of the time, you will be hearing just the noise of machinery humming away or the cute little speechfiles turrents play, when you cross their sights. Everything seems to be crafted with utmost love and care, even the unregular fade in of random soundtracks feel very nice. The music feels fitting and well made, a soundtrack that could capture your attention for days (and eventually did, for me anyway). Nothing feels interrupting or irritating. The game keeps its sound backdrop as shallow as its intention, one might say.Gameplay You play as a testsubject in a laboratory testsetting. You solve puzzles by using your portal gun to create portals and using gravitational or mechanical forces aswell as your wits. This game really set a new trend in case of puzzle games. I remember playing this game for the first time, it was very hard to adapt to the new premise of me being able to create portals. If you are a dedicated puzzle fan, this game is highly recommendable for you! You are garanteed to have about three to five hours of challenging puzzle solving fun!Additional content next to the main storyline is available in the form of a challenge mode (certain chambers that must be solved under different concitions, e.g. your least amount of portals you can create to get to the end) aswell as advanced maps (chambers, that have been increased in difficulty through some means). That makes another two to four hours of fun (be sure to take breaks though, some of the chambers are just unforgiving!).WeakpointsThere is only one weakpoint in my opinion: I have encountered some people, that did not like the game for its open ending. I can completely agree, the game mostly does a poor job at answering specific questions about it. BUT (very big BUT) it is intended to keep it that way, If you are a person, that favors conclusion over confusion, I hereby warn you about this game. You are intended to be kept in the dark, you are the test subject, everything is kept from you and only shared on a need-to-know basis. Do not play, if you are looking for answers, but if you want to ask questions. It is all just a matter of taste in the end.Concluding ThoughtsThe game, that changed everything. It is absolutely understandable why this game won several prizes and awards for its genuine design and loveable plotline. The mystery and world of Portal is created to make you ask: What is all this testing for? Why am I being tested on? And why am I here in the first place?Portal is a game I can safely recommend to EVERYONE. Yes, the game is that simple and enjoyable. A true game that set a new standard. Whoever came up with the idea and its whole execution should be swimming in adoration and money right now. I am completely content with this game and I enjoy it to this day. Play it. You really should. You're missing out if you don't. So get to it! NOW!			"

												(my old Portal review from dawnbreakergaming.com)Portal to the PastFor the approximate 5 people in the world who haven’t heard about this game, on October 10th, 2007, Valve released this little game named Portal, as part of a package known as The Orange Box. Published and developed by Valve Corporation, it was released on Valve’s own digital store, Steam, and it was also available for the XBox 360 and the PlayStation 3. Originally, I only wanted the Orange Box for the game Team Fortress 2, a game I had been eagerly awaiting the release of for years, as I played the original mod for the game Quake. However, since Portal came with it, I decided to give it a shot. Once I started playing, I ended up staying up all night and completing the game. Portal is by no means a very long game, but it lasted long enough to be a very enjoyable experience without overstaying its welcome. PlotPortal revolves around the player character protagonist Chell, who wakes up from stasis to warnings and instructions for the upcoming tests in what is called the Enrichment Center. Chell then proceeds through these test chambers, which get increasingly dangerous. Despite promises of counseling (and cake) from the AI known as GLaDOS, it becomes clear GLaDOS does not regard human life as very valuable. As the story progresses you obtain the use of a Portal gun, which allows you to project 2 portals on to various surfaces.  Each portal created can be used as an entrance, and after entering either one, you’ll then exit at the location of the other portal.  This allows you to travel instantaneously between them, but you also keep your momentum as you pass through them, allowing you to do a variety of physics tricks that can help you reach various locations.Now it is hard to really go into the plot without spoiling things, so without ruining the surprise, the plot revolves around your fight for survival as you travel through the world alone. The game provides you with mostly inanimate objects and verbal abuse from the aforementioned GLaDOS.  Humans are reduced to guinea pigs as GLaDOS pits you against various rooms that force you to solve puzzles on how to reach certain locations, as well as a variety of other challenges,  such as moving objects around to hold down buttons, all while trying to stay alive.  There are many dangers that you’ll encounter, and they can be as simple as avoiding a deadly liquid, to dodging military droids that track and shoot you when moving within their view.  Somehow, through all of these fairly empty chambers, you will find the most compelling of stories. By design, you will get attached to the most unlikely of companions. “Somehow, through all of these fairly empty chambers, you will find the most compelling of stories.” GameplayPortal is a mix of first person shooter and puzzle-platformer, and in my opinion, it is probably one of the best games ever to mix those genres. Instead of shooting things to kill or destroy them outright, you use your Portal gun to navigate a series of test chambers by moving between locations you would not be able to reach by normal means, as well as move objects that can be the key to opening the path to exiting these chambers. Luckily you are equipped in such a way that keeps you from taking any fall damage, or else each chamber would be even more dangerous and deadlier than they already are. There is often more than one way of using your portal gun and items in your surroundings to reach your goals. In fact there are additional challenges in the game, separate from the main story line, that pit you against a time clock, or have you complete specific chambers with the least amount of portal use as possible. After the main story I wanted to play Portal so much more that I went back and played through these challenges as well.  I was surprised that I was able to complete a deceptively vast chamber with literally 2 portals. I'm even fairly certain that I completed a test chamber in the most unique of ways; using a wall that opens temporarily by placing the exit portal on it while it was open. In short, the gameplay is wonderful, with the use of tight controls, physics, and a bit of creativity, the things you can do are amazing. Being able to think through a puzzle and execute the motions required to finish the chamber results in the most satisfying feeling! “Being able to think through a puzzle and execute the motions required to finish the chamber results in the most satisfying feeling!”EnvironmentsThe test chambers feature a very clean aesthetic that starts out simple, but become more complex over time. It seems clear that the chambers were designed not only to convey the situation you were in, but also to allow the player to easily gauge their portal shots to effectively navigate each puzzle presented. They have a mix of artistic style and practicality that I wish more games effectively accomplished. Various things are added to the simple world as you progress, but hidden around the corner from the sleek walls that you see are things that break up the otherwise very similar surroundings of each test chamber. As you progress, and perchance get tired of the solid colors and shapes of many locals, the game changes the surroundings, dramatically keeping you engaged in what is a fairly linear path. The aesthetic is so well liked that it has been copied in many other places, such as a map in the game Killing Floor. I personally enjoy it a lot and seek to play other games that have levels inspired by Portal. Most of the game has a non-lyrical, ambient music that is made to match the mood of the environments, and in the ending credits there is a song called “Still Alive” which many adore. The song’s execution and humor is hard to adequately describe, but I can say that it has been praised and played in various places. (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_Alive) More InfoPortal is a spiritual successor to the freeware game Narbacular Drop, which was a 2005 independent indie game developed by Nuclear Monkey Software. Robin Walker, one of Valve’s developers, saw the game at the DigiPen Institute of Technology annual career fair, which then lead to Gabe Newell, CEO of Valve, seeing the game and offering the entire team jobs at Valve.

 )The Portal universe is actually set in the Half-Life universe, another game created by Valve. There is also an official comic called Lab Rat that connects the story of the original Portal, to its sequel, Portal 2. Portal is now also available to enjoy on OS X, Linux, and Android. The game’s popularity has lead to a wide variety of merchandise associated with Portal, such as coffee mugs and plush toys. There is also an on going internet meme relating to the phrase “the cake is a lie.” PerformanceFrom my perspective of the PC version; the game runs very well, as it should on fairly modern systems due to the fact it is built on Valve’s Source Engine, which has been used in many games such as Counter Strike: Source, Left 4 Dead, and Half-Life 2.  It does not even require a gig of RAM or a multi-core processor, so even older PC’s or laptops can easily play this game. (source:  ) Bottom LineI love this game, and I’m certainly not alone, as many, many, many others also love it. In fact, it received critical reception, as it earned more praise than Half-Life 2: Episode Two, and Team Fortress 2, which were both included in the Orange Box. It won various awards including Game of the Year, Innovation Award, and Best Game Design at the 2008 Game Developers Choice Awards.

												I'm racking my brain, trying to think of a reason to say this game isn't perfect that doesn't seem like a petty nitpick.I reject the ideas of length (a choice) and replayability (unavoidable in the genre).  The one-note nature of the puzzles has some merit, but the whole game is about the portals, so that's not it.  The FPS controls will prove a barrier to non-gamers, limiting accessibility, but, again, this springs from a selection of engine that I don't think is wrong.  A couple of the puzzles were a little obtuse, but once you figured them out, they made sense, and anyway, you wouldn't want it to be too easy.  The main reason I don't like physics puzzlers is that their engine is too sensitive or finicky, and even once you figure out the solution, it takes a frustrating number of repetitions to implement it.  This never bothered me in Portal, though (probably because you're not stacking things, it's always just one box and some portals).  Timed sections are a little annoying, and the final boss a tad out-of-place, but that's really minor.  The idea that everyone else thinks it's great, so I should disagree is just childish.Nope, it's perfect (or as close as a game can get).			"

AUDIOAtmosphericVISUALMinimalistDIFFICULTYToughVIBEHumorousCRAVINGShort TripON SALEFrequentlyPROS: Portal is optimized brilliantly, I'm convinced this game will run on a toaster. It's one of the best games to grace low-end systems. Portal is a mysterious and thrilling trek through Aperture facility, both through the testing chambers and under its squeaky-clean hood. The difficulty ascends nicely, the game controls well, and the story is bound to incite you to finish it in one sitting. CONS: ""Thinking with Portals"" can be a little tough for users just starting out. Have patience! The game is relatively short if you're a seasoned puzzler, though you have challenges after the campaign to try out. These challenges are honestly a bit clunky and poor in quality, though.WORTH: Not only does this game go on sale often, but it's frequently bundled with many awesome games! If you're missing the half-life series though, your best bet is to get it in a Valve bundle during a major holiday sale. Obviously this is their platform, so you're due to see some of the best deals involving this game right here on Steam. OVERALL: Portal is evidence that games are a powerful medium for story-telling and is a very exciting display of how a puzzle-FPS hybrid can go swimmingly. It's very easy to imagine this game as a walking simulator, It has rightfully earned its place as an icon of modern gaming.SCORE: 9/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												Great game with very original gameplay and story.  The riddles are not hard, and you can finish campaign in 2-3h. The game also offers harder versions of some chambers and challenges (that are really hard on gold), so if you want to finish the game on 100% and get all the achievements, the playtime will be much higher.And don't forget... THE CAKE IS A LIE!			"

												I was thinking one day, if I was going to introduce one game to someone who has never played a game or had any interest in gaming. I thought about this long and hard. Would it be an old game to show them how it started? Should it be a recent game to show them where were are now? Console or PC, Story driven or arcade-y, and what genre? I thought about this long and hard. Then it hit me. Portal. It starts off slow, but not too slow. It give the player a mystery, letting them be intrigued and keep on going. It doesn't rush them into anything, so it's not overwhelming. The gamplay is unique, and anyone would be interested in the concept of using portals to solve puzzles. The puzzles are designed in such way that they are challenging for anyone, yet you don't need any outside knowledge to solve them. It's not overly anything, there would be no way a new player would get overwhelmed and want to quit. Yet the game drives you to move forward. It's briliant. I don't think any game is perfect. But the closest game to being perfect would have to be Portal. So yeah, buy it and stuff.			"

												Portal is a game that gets you thinking with portals. You are being tested with portals and you have to solve various puzzles. It's a wonderful game, although it's a short one. It takes around an hour to complete.The graphics don't need to be hyper realistic and actually aren't far off from the sequel of this game, 'Portal 2'.The puzzles aren't the hardest things in the world, and are also often based off of momentum, or to describe it simply, ""speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.""Though, the difficulty of the puzzles doesn't mean you won't die. Some puzzles will cause your death on the first try, but when you finally reach the moment when your mind figures out how to do this certain puzzle, the feeling is simply awesome.There are slight tricks that the robotic AI, GLaDOS says/does, one example is the promise of cake. She says ""You will be baked, and there will be cake"", which basically means that she will attempt to kill you with fire.Those tricks are nice and will cause you to listen to that part again to see if you heard it incorrectly or not. Ultimately, this is quite an exceptional game.Short version: Nice gameplay. Good graphics. Awesome sensations, and neat twists. It's a tad bit short, bit is exceptionally grand. "

												10/10Gameplay: So you  start of in this glass cage and you soon find out you are to under go test chambers. From there forward you have to gt pass each chamber, but each one getting harder. This game test's your intelligence, so take time in each chamber and respct how clever the chambers are. It can get quite repetitive but if you enjoy puzzle games then there should be no problem in playing till the end.Story: Well the story is very basic, you are instructed through chambers by a robot, this robot just talks about crap and cake throughout. But you soon start to unveil dark secrets about the lab and the ending reveals all secrets about the lab.My favourite feature: My favourite feature is the mixed feelings you feel to the robot. She slowly changes throughout the story and i like how th player changes with her.			"

												Shakespeare was right when he wrote “to be or not to be,” because that’s generally how I organize my pencils. It works, but I’ve found myself a puzzle game that doesn’t require writing down information. Portal is this game. When I heard Portal was a comedy puzzle game I was incalculably confused, so the game had already carried out its function. But that’s beside the point. I simply didn’t understand the concept. Did the portals make witty comments as you jumped through them or were you just taunted every time you failed a puzzle? Well it turns out I was half right with the latter option. Somebody thought it would be a good idea to transform a woman into a machine and she decided to kill everyone and test the survivors. That would be you. However, she (or is she an it?) likes to make sarcastic remarks every ten seconds. Whether you laugh or not is unimportant because you will laugh.The main idea is that you connect 2 spaces with portals which you can travel through or transport objects through. And you will do this while avoiding apathetic turrets. Nevertheless, you will be pushed on by the incentive of cake; whether it is or isn’t a lie. Puzzle games generally increase your brain power, but I’d say I learned one very important lesson from Portal. If you’re going to turn a woman into a robot who has power over a huge science facility, be sure to choose the right week.			"

												Portal is Valve's first-person puzzle-platformer, released in 2007. Here are my ratings:Pros:+ Valve's Source engine+ Voice acting and music+ Unique, original story + Amazing characters+ Gameplay mechanics+ Inovative design and unique physics+ Probably best game Achievements with Advanced chambersCons:- Story is quite short. I managed to finish it in about 3 hours.There is no doubt why Portal made a big influence in gaming world in 2007. Characters, puzzle rooms and game mechanics are very original and award winning. I also really liked Achievement system. I managed to do all 15 of them, and they are really challenging and fun. Perfect game.The cake is a lie.			"

												(my old Portal review from dawnbreakergaming.com)Portal to the PastFor the approximate 5 people in the world who haven’t heard about this game, on October 10th, 2007, Valve released this little game named Portal, as part of a package known as The Orange Box. Published and developed by Valve Corporation, it was released on Valve’s own digital store, Steam, and it was also available for the XBox 360 and the PlayStation 3. Originally, I only wanted the Orange Box for the game Team Fortress 2, a game I had been eagerly awaiting the release of for years, as I played the original mod for the game Quake. However, since Portal came with it, I decided to give it a shot. Once I started playing, I ended up staying up all night and completing the game. Portal is by no means a very long game, but it lasted long enough to be a very enjoyable experience without overstaying its welcome. PlotPortal revolves around the player character protagonist Chell, who wakes up from stasis to warnings and instructions for the upcoming tests in what is called the Enrichment Center. Chell then proceeds through these test chambers, which get increasingly dangerous. Despite promises of counseling (and cake) from the AI known as GLaDOS, it becomes clear GLaDOS does not regard human life as very valuable. As the story progresses you obtain the use of a Portal gun, which allows you to project 2 portals on to various surfaces.  Each portal created can be used as an entrance, and after entering either one, you’ll then exit at the location of the other portal.  This allows you to travel instantaneously between them, but you also keep your momentum as you pass through them, allowing you to do a variety of physics tricks that can help you reach various locations.Now it is hard to really go into the plot without spoiling things, so without ruining the surprise, the plot revolves around your fight for survival as you travel through the world alone. The game provides you with mostly inanimate objects and verbal abuse from the aforementioned GLaDOS.  Humans are reduced to guinea pigs as GLaDOS pits you against various rooms that force you to solve puzzles on how to reach certain locations, as well as a variety of other challenges,  such as moving objects around to hold down buttons, all while trying to stay alive.  There are many dangers that you’ll encounter, and they can be as simple as avoiding a deadly liquid, to dodging military droids that track and shoot you when moving within their view.  Somehow, through all of these fairly empty chambers, you will find the most compelling of stories. By design, you will get attached to the most unlikely of companions. “Somehow, through all of these fairly empty chambers, you will find the most compelling of stories.” GameplayPortal is a mix of first person shooter and puzzle-platformer, and in my opinion, it is probably one of the best games ever to mix those genres. Instead of shooting things to kill or destroy them outright, you use your Portal gun to navigate a series of test chambers by moving between locations you would not be able to reach by normal means, as well as move objects that can be the key to opening the path to exiting these chambers. Luckily you are equipped in such a way that keeps you from taking any fall damage, or else each chamber would be even more dangerous and deadlier than they already are. There is often more than one way of using your portal gun and items in your surroundings to reach your goals. In fact there are additional challenges in the game, separate from the main story line, that pit you against a time clock, or have you complete specific chambers with the least amount of portal use as possible. After the main story I wanted to play Portal so much more that I went back and played through these challenges as well.  I was surprised that I was able to complete a deceptively vast chamber with literally 2 portals. I'm even fairly certain that I completed a test chamber in the most unique of ways; using a wall that opens temporarily by placing the exit portal on it while it was open. In short, the gameplay is wonderful, with the use of tight controls, physics, and a bit of creativity, the things you can do are amazing. Being able to think through a puzzle and execute the motions required to finish the chamber results in the most satisfying feeling! “Being able to think through a puzzle and execute the motions required to finish the chamber results in the most satisfying feeling!”EnvironmentsThe test chambers feature a very clean aesthetic that starts out simple, but become more complex over time. It seems clear that the chambers were designed not only to convey the situation you were in, but also to allow the player to easily gauge their portal shots to effectively navigate each puzzle presented. They have a mix of artistic style and practicality that I wish more games effectively accomplished. Various things are added to the simple world as you progress, but hidden around the corner from the sleek walls that you see are things that break up the otherwise very similar surroundings of each test chamber. As you progress, and perchance get tired of the solid colors and shapes of many locals, the game changes the surroundings, dramatically keeping you engaged in what is a fairly linear path. The aesthetic is so well liked that it has been copied in many other places, such as a map in the game Killing Floor. I personally enjoy it a lot and seek to play other games that have levels inspired by Portal. Most of the game has a non-lyrical, ambient music that is made to match the mood of the environments, and in the ending credits there is a song called “Still Alive” which many adore. The song’s execution and humor is hard to adequately describe, but I can say that it has been praised and played in various places. (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Still_Alive) More InfoPortal is a spiritual successor to the freeware game Narbacular Drop, which was a 2005 independent indie game developed by Nuclear Monkey Software. Robin Walker, one of Valve’s developers, saw the game at the DigiPen Institute of Technology annual career fair, which then lead to Gabe Newell, CEO of Valve, seeing the game and offering the entire team jobs at Valve.

 )The Portal universe is actually set in the Half-Life universe, another game created by Valve. There is also an official comic called Lab Rat that connects the story of the original Portal, to its sequel, Portal 2. Portal is now also available to enjoy on OS X, Linux, and Android. The game’s popularity has lead to a wide variety of merchandise associated with Portal, such as coffee mugs and plush toys. There is also an on going internet meme relating to the phrase “the cake is a lie.” PerformanceFrom my perspective of the PC version; the game runs very well, as it should on fairly modern systems due to the fact it is built on Valve’s Source Engine, which has been used in many games such as Counter Strike: Source, Left 4 Dead, and Half-Life 2.  It does not even require a gig of RAM or a multi-core processor, so even older PC’s or laptops can easily play this game. (source:  ) Bottom LineI love this game, and I’m certainly not alone, as many, many, many others also love it. In fact, it received critical reception, as it earned more praise than Half-Life 2: Episode Two, and Team Fortress 2, which were both included in the Orange Box. It won various awards including Game of the Year, Innovation Award, and Best Game Design at the 2008 Game Developers Choice Awards. (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game) http://www.gamechoiceawards.com/archive/gdca_8th.html) Great story. Great humor. Great puzzles. If you like FPS with a side of puzzles and dark humor, this game is for you!			"

												I'm racking my brain, trying to think of a reason to say this game isn't perfect that doesn't seem like a petty nitpick.I reject the ideas of length (a choice) and replayability (unavoidable in the genre).  The one-note nature of the puzzles has some merit, but the whole game is about the portals, so that's not it.  The FPS controls will prove a barrier to non-gamers, limiting accessibility, but, again, this springs from a selection of engine that I don't think is wrong.  A couple of the puzzles were a little obtuse, but once you figured them out, they made sense, and anyway, you wouldn't want it to be too easy.  The main reason I don't like physics puzzlers is that their engine is too sensitive or finicky, and even once you figure out the solution, it takes a frustrating number of repetitions to implement it.  This never bothered me in Portal, though (probably because you're not stacking things, it's always just one box and some portals).  Timed sections are a little annoying, and the final boss a tad out-of-place, but that's really minor.  The idea that everyone else thinks it's great, so I should disagree is just childish.Nope, it's perfect (or as close as a game can get).			"

												English: Very fun puzzle game although it is not as good as Portal 2 it is still good and defenatly worth paying you will defenatly be able to find this game in a Steam sale soon and you should buy it when you do. In my review of Portal 2 I complained about how I thought that the game was too short, well this is also the case with this game, infact it is even shorter and even more limited but still worth playing. This game is a perfect example that Valve's reputation for making amazing games is still true!العربية: لعبة ممتعة جدا اللغز على الرغم من أنه ليست جيدة كما أنها بوابة ٢ لا تزال جيدة ويستحق أن يدفع ديفيناتلي سوف تكون قادرة على العثور على ديفيناتلي هذه اللعبة في بيع البخار قريبا ويجب شرائه عند القيام به. في تقييمي من بوابة ٢ أنا اشتكى كيف اعتقدت أن اللعبة كانت قصيرة للغاية، وأيضا هذا هو الحال أيضا مع هذه اللعبة، حقيقة أنه حتى أقصر وأكثر محدودية  ولكن لا يزال يستحق اللعب. هذه اللعبة هو خير مثال على هذه السمعة صمام لصنع الالعاب مذهلة لا يزال صحيحا			"

AUDIOAtmosphericVISUALMinimalistDIFFICULTYToughVIBEHumorousCRAVINGShort TripON SALEFrequentlyPROS: Portal is optimized brilliantly, I'm convinced this game will run on a toaster. It's one of the best games to grace low-end systems. Portal is a mysterious and thrilling trek through Aperture facility, both through the testing chambers and under its squeaky-clean hood. The difficulty ascends nicely, the game controls well, and the story is bound to incite you to finish it in one sitting. CONS: ""Thinking with Portals"" can be a little tough for users just starting out. Have patience! The game is relatively short if you're a seasoned puzzler, though you have challenges after the campaign to try out. These challenges are honestly a bit clunky and poor in quality, though.WORTH: Not only does this game go on sale often, but it's frequently bundled with many awesome games! If you're missing the half-life series though, your best bet is to get it in a Valve bundle during a major holiday sale. Obviously this is their platform, so you're due to see some of the best deals involving this game right here on Steam. OVERALL: Portal is evidence that games are a powerful medium for story-telling and is a very exciting display of how a puzzle-FPS hybrid can go swimmingly. It's very easy to imagine this game as a walking simulator, It has rightfully earned its place as an icon of modern gaming.SCORE: 9/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												Portal is a first person puzzle game.The main feature of the game is the world famous portal gun,which allows the player to place two portals in vision range.Graphics:     7/10The game is based on the Source Engine. So if you have ever played a Source game you get an idea of the quality. The textures, shader effects and particle effects on objects do have a high quality.I personally dislike some wall and floor textures. The ""useless"" accessory objects like empty milk cartons are really low detailed. Some colors are really dirty and the resolution of the low detailed ""side objects"" has grade of Half Life 1 graphics. The developers just focused on the important objects and areas you will interact with. The good news is that you won't face those low detailed objects all along and everywhere. It's valid to give a rating of 7/10.Sound:     9/10Although the Portal developers seem to not appreciate background music, they created a legenday ending music. The rest of the game is a pretty silent business, but it matches the scenery. The portal gun sound is almost as famous as the portal gun itself - for a reason. It fits perfectly and never becomes annoying or boring. The energy balls have an authentic sound and the movable platforms have aswell. But that's not enough to justify a 9/10 rating. The main reason I give 9/10 is the voice actress of the supercomputer GLaDOS. ""She"" is the only other character you will face in the whole game and Valve managed to make her entertaining and authentic. After finishing the game I missed the voice a bit. The turrets (enemies) are also legendary. They are talking to you like a ""friend"" and try to persuade you to reveal yourself or to put them down when you lift them. Level design:     10/10Since the whole game's purpose is escaping and solving puzzles I can't give any other rating than a 10/10. You won't find many games that will offer you a better 3D-Puzzle level design than Portal. The laboratory testing rooms are clever structured, never unfair and characterize the game.Gameplay/Handling/Equipment:     10/10Portal has a really unique gameplay and really unique equipment (portal gun). There is not much to tell about it. It's extremely fun to solve the puzzles and the portal gun is your awesome tool. The controls are very intuitive and allow for really fast actions which makes speedrunning the game attractive.Enemies/AI:     5/10Well, the game has just two enemy types, the turrets and the ""endboss"".Both have a straightforward combat pattern. I was a little bit disappointed that the endboss wasn't that interesting. It's a puzzle game not a shooter but still they wasted potential here. I give 0/5 points for the attack pattern and 5/5 points for the enemy design and idea. => 5/10Story:     7/10The story can be told very quickly, but somehow the game makes you feel that there is much more in the background than it seems to be in the first place. The game brings up many questions and won't answer all of them. If you want a few more answers you'll have to play the sequel. It's hard to explain the rating, because when put into words the story sounds relatively boring: You are a test person who gets the order from GLaDOS to solve puzzles with the portal gun. Your goal is to escape from the laboratory.Critic summary:     8/10Personal fun rating:     8/10     [very good game]It's one of my favorite games. It may have some points of criticism but summed up it's worth playing. The game will give you a unique gameplay experience and you will remember the levels for a long time. I can definitely recommend the game even if it would cost 20 bucks.			"

												Game: PortalSummary: Quirky, inventive first-person puzzle game with a good ending.Rating (5/10 = failure): 9/10Multiplayer: NoCompletion: 5 hrsCards: NoCloud: YesCost: 2.5 USDRefreshingly, for a first person game, Portal is not a shooter in the traditional sense. The name of the game is to escape, using a fascinating device that lets you open up personal wormholes on special surfaces. Guiding you on your way is a forever omnipresent computer AI that is perhaps a little too interested in testing her subjects.I take that back. The name of the game is to drop yourself into infinite free fall, hurl yourself across giant chasms of acid, and somehow always land like a cat. And damn is that fun.Puzzles, for the most part, involve moving blocks onto platforms so that you can open a door. But thankfully that's not nearly as boring as it sounds. You'll have to get creative, and, while it bothers me when puzzle games do this, you'll need to bring reflexes/timing into some puzzles.My only problem (which is a personal problem) is that the game is entirely in first person. I can't play for too long without suffering from motion sickness. I would have liked it if the game allowed 3rd person without the use of the console. I understand they wanted to keep the player's identity a secret until you look at yourself through a portal, but it's not like this was a major reveal or anything. This is enough of a problem for me that I had to dock some points for the game because I still fail to see how 3rd person would have ruined the experience.Very well thought-out puzzles, good narrative, and a great ending song (which I didn't really connect with until I played the game) that will stick in your head for weeks. 9/10			"

												Portal is one of those games that gets you thinking. The game indirectly teaches you new strategies to solve the puzzles, and it feels rewarding when you realize how to solve them. After solving a series of puzzles you are then awarded with cake.I was instantly hooked by the smart concept of this game. Portal comes with great mechanics and style. The levels pace very well; they start off easy and are quick while the later levels become more challenging. Although it can be quite frustrating at times, frustrating enough to the point where you are stuck and must see a walkthrough online, the puzzles are generally easy and you can finish the game in 4 hours or less. Because you will only get a few hours from this game, I would recommend to wait on that discount or go for The Orange Box (bundle). Either way you will not regret buying Portal and have immense fun playing the few hours it serves!90/100			"

Summary:The original of the critically acclaimed puzzle-platformer series, Portal is arguably the closest to 'perfection' a game has ever reached. With GLaDOS's humorous quips and the game's brilliantly executed puzzles, it's a short experience which is sure to stick with you forever.Rating:1 - A masterpiece. An essential purchase for everyone.2 - Great game. Highly recommended to most people.3 - Fairly good game. Recommended mainly for fans of the genre or when on sale.4 - Poor game. Not recommended but has a few merits.5 - Awful game. Would not recommend to anyone in their right minds.			"

												Firstly, I'd like to say that this game is very far up on my favourite games of all time, alongside games of completely different genres such as Fallout 2.The setting for Portal is unclear immediately, but you quickly become aware of the fact that you are a test subject for Aperture Labs, whcih cements its place in the Half-Life universe. Guided by an omnipresent voice, you make your way through the different chambers of increasingly difficult tests.Although this synopsis may make this game seem somewhat shallow, it most certainly is not. The main character, Chell, although mute, develops a personality regardless. An attachment is created with this voice guiding you. And, most cryptically, is the hidden areas in the chambers. These give background into Aperture Laboratories, the 'voice', and possibly the sole survivor.When compared to Portal 2, Portal does have some significant flaws. This include a lack of characters and personality which, although there, isn't built upon until later in the game. There aren't as many testing mechanics in the original, but this leads to much more creative test designes, requiring ingenuity over resources.Overall, this game is amazing, and you will fell dissapointed upon its completion. Portal 2 builds upon the first, and is a must after this is completed.			"

												I don't feel like I need to describe the awesomeness of this game in a review... this game alone is responsible for so many internet phenomena (""the cake is a lie!!!""), doesn't that tell you enough?You're stuck in some sort of ""testing facility"" for robots (?) and the computer controlling seem to not care/know you're not one. You're then submitted to a series of testing chambers. The humour is DARK and extremely funny ""I will write it here... did well... enough"". The feeling of helplessness perfectly matches the game. The chambers are challenging on their own, but you can choose Challenge Modes for extra difficulty. Achievements are a pain, be warned and learn how to enjoy pain.			"

												10/10Gameplay: So you  start of in this glass cage and you soon find out you are to under go test chambers. From there forward you have to gt pass each chamber, but each one getting harder. This game test's your intelligence, so take time in each chamber and respct how clever the chambers are. It can get quite repetitive but if you enjoy puzzle games then there should be no problem in playing till the end.Story: Well the story is very basic, you are instructed through chambers by a robot, this robot just talks about crap and cake throughout. But you soon start to unveil dark secrets about the lab and the ending reveals all secrets about the lab.My favourite feature: My favourite feature is the mixed feelings you feel to the robot. She slowly changes throughout the story and i like how th player changes with her.			"

												By now everyone has heard of portal in one form or another, songs, memes, artwork, and countless spoofs and jokes. The original game is highly recommended for its sometimes disorienting but consistent challenge and puzzling fun. Its great if you enjoy witty dry humor as well. While its a bit short, its truly a gem of a game, and very unique.If you still want more really great content after beating Portal, check out the ""Portal The Flash Version MapPack"" which adds what is basically another whole campaign worth of linked maps to the game. While it does not rival the original in story, its puzzles and level design are just as good.			"

												Great game! But it does have some issues. First of all, the storyline is very short. Second, its not very well optimised so I get random lag that lasts for 30 seconds or more. Third, there are a few glitches that haven't been fixed. For example, in one of ratt mans dens if I aim and fire a portal at the door, the portal firing effect stays floating in the air. Apart from those things, this game is worth the money!			"

-Quick Review-Portal is a First-Person Puzzle game developed by Valve and released late 2007. Portal is completely dedicated to solving problems by using two portals to move objects or the protagonist through the various puzzles.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: Portal takes place exclusively in the Apature Science Laboratories Enrichment Center. The Silent Protagonist Bby the name of “Chell”) awakens in a small room, she is instructed by the Artificial Intelligence known as “GlaDOS” to complete the various test chambers and then Chell will be rewarded with cake.

Gameplay: The gameplay introduced by Portal was probably one of the most innovative and unique concepts introduced by valve, and easily one of the best games released in 2007.As you progress through the game, you are introduced slowly to new concepts and new tricks that you can implement. You start the game with the extremely primitive concept of “put the block on the button”, but after completing a sequence of Test Chambers and obtaining the “Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device” or just “portal gun”, the puzzles get really crazy.Achievements: There are 15 achievements in Portal, five achievements are normally unlocked on your first play through, another five achievements are very well explained and relatively easy to obtain (Generally by knowing the best location to get them, or preforming specific tricks, or completing some advanced maps).The last set of achievements is the toughest, earning gold medals on all portal challenges, Detaching all security cameras from the walls, and Finding all the hidden Transmissions. (Unless you're going to put an ungodly amount of time into portal, you'll probably need to read guides.)

Price: Portal is priced at $9.99, the value system I use is “Price divided by GameTime = Value”. Generally playing through the Portal story once will be about 6 hours, give or take a few hours depending on puzzle solving skill. This game has enough content to keep the player busy for 9 hours, but most people won't take advantage of all the features, so the price is a bit high. I suggest going for a bundle deal like the Orange Box (Especially if you're interested in the Half-Life 2 games), or waiting for a steam sale before purchasing.Conclusion: Story: Excellent, some of the finest content Valve has ever released. Gameplay: Memorable, enjoyable, and addicting. Achievements: a nice blend of difficulty, but not an easy 100% completion game. Price: A bit higher then what I'd prefer, but on the enjoyable factor, Portal is definitely worth it.I have a personal bias for this game, because the first product I bought on Steam was the Orange Box, so this is among the first games I've ever played on Steam! I easily recommend this game to anyone who enjoys puzzle games, but this game can appeal to just about anyone, hardcore and softcore alike.

												Portal is definitely not the best game I ever played, but I had some fun playing it. An idea to use portal mechanic to create puzzles absolutely got me. I understand that it's a rather old game for today's standards, but I'd like to point some flaws of it. Firstly, it's rather short. Completing the main story took me around 2 hours. Not much comparing with other games. Don't expect a long journey from it, but on the other side, it's the time well spent.Secondly (that's gonna be a good one) - the puzzles were rather easy. I'm not telling it was a cakewalk (oops, that was an accident, I promise), but this game lacks real challenge aside from 6 advanced test chambers. That's only my opinion, though, I'd really appreciate to hear yours.But there is also a thing I'd like to mention too - there are actually very few loading screens. Not like it has a crucial meaning, but it really makes you not die waiting.Overall, I do not regret playing this game. Of course, every game has it flaws, but hey - nothing's perfect. Considering Portal's pros and cons, I can give it solid 7.5/10. See that game on sale? Buy it. Try it out....Graphics? What the hell do you want from graphics? They're good, just enjoy the game itself.			"

												The cake may be a lie, but the fun isn't.Portal uses a very unique gameplay that wasn't seen in the other Valve games. The only ""weapon"" you're given is a portal gun that can shoot a portal entrance with the right mouse button and a portal exit with the left mouse button. Once both portals have been placed, you can walk though them. The portals can be shot across a distance but only on certain surfaces, which creates the puzzle atmosphere. You'll have to figure out how to get across chasms, up and over obstacles, and around automated turrets. The trick is that you can only have one entrance and one exit meaning you'll encounter many brain teasers on how to use the portals correctly and in some cases, quickly and often. It'll make you think about which portal you're placing, the exact location of where it needs to go, and the timing of when portals need to be switched.You're not the only thing that can move through these portals. The weighted companion blocks can be used to take out turrets by placing a portal over the turret's head and another under a block. Energy spheres are used frequently where players have to negotiate their path using portals to activate a switch. There are some really fun uses of the portals here, especially in all of those strange moments where you can see yourself through a portal across the room entering the portal you're stepping through.While the main game is short, Portal doesn't only finish with one of the best credits songs ever created. After the story is done new challenge levels are unlocked. These extras are six levels that you've already played. The difference is that they have new challenges associated with them. You'll have to see if you can complete the puzzles in a certain amount of time, a minimum number of footsteps, or using only a certain number of portals. These challenges are really interesting because they make you consider puzzles that were somewhat simple to figure out in a different way. The idea behind Portal ends up being more brilliant than Portal itself.			"

												Portal is a Fun Challenging Original Puzzle Game made by Valve Corporation. It brings Skill, Challenges, and Cake to the Table. At first it starts off Easy but gets Harder as you Advance in the Game. Once you Learn the ways of Portal it will be a Piece Of Cake! (Pun Intended) The Portal Gun will Navigate you anywhere you want. Using Portals you can get anywhere faster then you normally would. The Price of $10.99 is an Amazing Deal for this game. You can spend Hours upon Hours just screwing around with the Portal Gun. So what are you waiting for? Buy Portal, Dim the Lights, and grab yourself some Cake for this Great Puzzle Game!10/10			"

The game is fairly short, with about 20 minutes required to pass the campaign casually, but it also has challenge modes, and a few achievements to keep yourself busy. Some of them are quite challenging, but I managed to get all the achievements in about 13 hours. Great game overall!			"

												Ah, the game that makes you ""Think with Portals"". This game is really fun, the puzzles require thinking but you don't need to be a mastermind about it. GlaDOS is one of the most memorable characters of all time. Her voice and temper make for a perfect friendly villain. The gameplay is all around solving puzzles and thinking quick. Really atmospheric, especially with the music, which I liked a lot. Quite short, but totally fun.10/10 "

 Overview Portal is, although short, a really fun game. It's puzzles are not too complicated and are more of a  tutorial  of the game then, really, a part of the game. It doesn't have too good of an aesthetics, as the textures repeat a lot. In the beginning, you are pretty much clueless about the story, it's mostly told when you are nearing to the end of the game. Playtime Portal's playtime is about 2.5-3 hours. If you want to 100% the game (get all the achievements, etc.) it will take about 7-8 hours. Rating   Aspect Rating Description   Story 5/10 The story isn't told very well.  You have to explore the chambers a bit to get small pieces of the story that are       written on the walls. The most of the story is told to the player when the game is nearing the end.   Aesthetics 7/10 The textures on the rooms get a little bit repetitive. All the textures repeat in every test chamber. The only part where you see a bit of change is when the game is nearing it's end.   Mechanics 9/10 Portal mechanics work really well, even though there are a few bugs, it's pretty good. Running and jumping do feel a bit slow, but every modern game does that nowadays.   Graphics 7/10 Portal is a realatively old game. So the graphics aren't that great, but it isn't like that they are bad either.   Overall rating 7/10   "

												Portal is a funny game. it gives you the knowladge that graphics isn't everything. The game tells an interesting story; a very good one at that, and the gamepllay is brilliant. Maybe, at times, not the most fast story, but he eerie hints at what is going on behind youre back, the graffiti that- Oh wait. Spoiler alert.Anyway, Portal is a great game. The narative is good, as is the gameplay, and there's a sequal, so it clearly did well.10/10 Worth 7 quid. "

												The mother♥♥♥♥ing cake is a lie. Hell yeah another piece of the Orange Box I now review and it kicks ♥♥♥ as well. Portal is a puzzle game that uses portals in case you are completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥...so in essence im referring to about 99% of the visitors of this site. Well Portal may just be a puzzle game but it ♥♥♥♥ing rocks.Graphics: I'm making a note here. Huge Success. The graphics in this game are ♥♥♥♥ing great just like everything else in the Orange box. All the hallways and levels are detailed in that clean white lab looking way. All the textures on everything...the levels, companion cube, and the portal gun all look extremely sharp. Not to mention, the models for the various boxes, the chick all look damn good as well. Also with the motion blur effects in the new source games helps to add more graphic good shitness to the game. Basically the graphics are sharp and detailed and just feel right for being the Aperture Science testing lab. If you they don't feel right to you then that means you are a ♥♥♥♥♥♥.Sound: The audio in this game is ♥♥♥♥ing TOP SHELF. The music in the game kicks ♥♥♥, the portal sounds and basically everything has a good sound to it. But what really makes the game is the voice acting done by the computer and the turret guns as well as the dialog. This is finally a game that is actaully ♥♥♥♥ING HILARIOUS. The Cake is a Lie. The computer that is constantly guiding you threw is ♥♥♥♥ing comedy gold. ""Remember when I was all like I was going to kill you, and you were like oh no, and I was like ha just kidding."" I don't remember exactly what it says but it was ♥♥♥♥ing funny. This game definitely has some great writers Whoever wrote this dialog...someone call 10 hot ♥♥♥♥♥es to have them give him some sex. And Yes I call them ♥♥♥♥♥es because that is now the proper term for a woman...atleast what all this rap music has been telling me. One last note to make...the song at the end is ♥♥♥♥ing class.Gameplay: The basic premise of the game is to solve the puzzles using the Aperture Science portal gun. The tests are just done completely right. They aren't too hard yet not too easy. They are definitely fun to figure out and some of them can be quite MIND ♥♥♥♥ING BLOWING! Anyways the puzzles all rock as well does the boss fight at the end of the game where you use your portal gun to send the rockets through to hit the boss. Thats just genius right there. The only problem is this game is really short however it is damn fun the entire time.Story: You are some woman and you wake up in a testing lab. Then you grab a portal gun and solve some tests. Don't know the story but somehow the aperture science facility ties in with Black Mesa and Half-Life 2.Portal is ♥♥♥♥ing great. 10/10 "

												Despite it's reputation as a ""Meme Game"", Portal is one of the single greatest video games ever made. It's subtle, it's cohesive, it's fun, it's challenging, it's charming. It has one thing it's sequel doesn't; character. In my eyes, the genius and nuance behind Portal rivals that of even the well-known classics of the 80s and 90s.

												Portal is a new single player set in the mysterious Aperture Science Laboratories. The game is designed to change the way players approach, manipulate, and surmise the possibilities in a given environment. Similar to Half-Life 2 Gravity Gun create new ways to leverage an object in any given situation. You must solve physical puzzles and challenges by opening portals to maneuvering objects, and themselves, through space.			"

												This is one of the few games that I have gone back and played twice. I am for the most part a casual gamer, but this game made me get hardcore and spent a good amount of time trying to figure out the puzzles. The atmosphere and fun of the game wasn't lost when I beat it again either. I would recommend this to all of my friends. I think that everyone can enjoy this type of game. I have played it twice and still can't find many flaws in it.10/10 would be taken, knocked out, put in a small room, and deal with a sarcastic a.i. again.			"

												It's a short and sweet puzzle game...but especially the art style that portal has makes its so amazing. With about 3-4h average playtime its very short but you are definitely entertained during that time.It has a charming little story that gives all the puzzling a real reason.xbytez.euMetacritic:90  / 100 Metascore9.3 / 10 User Score			"
