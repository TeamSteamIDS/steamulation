												Of the Sands of Time trilogy, Warrior Within is easily the most controversial of the bunch. Forgoing the whimsical Nights of Arabia theme of the much beloved Sands of Time, Warrior Within employs a much darker tone, replacing melodic instrumentals with blood pumping metal music, and an emperor’s majestic castle with that of some dreadful thing from a metal album cover. Gone, too, is the storybook hero known only as the Prince, who is now a curse spewing, murder loving psychopath, easy to anger and eager to slice open stomachs. Understandably, not all took a liking to the new Prince of Persia, and many either wrote it off or gave up after dying in the first 10 minutes, all while cursing the monsters at Ubisoft who would dare slight their beloved franchise so vehemently. I am ashamed to admit that while I did not join in the publisher bashing those many years prior, I did assume the many fans’ angers as legitimate. After having neglected the franchise for many years since the original, I have finally played through the trilogy’s entirety. Lo and behold, my judgment is thus: Warrior Within is the best of the Prince of Persia trilogy, and one of the most challenging and equally frustrating and rewarding titles I have ever had the pleasure of besting.Where its predecessor, The Sands of Time, relied on linear level progression, a typically gradually increasing difficulty, and relatively basic (and easy) combat, Warrior Within features a (sort of) open world, varied weapons of combat, and enemies that will break your face if you’re not perfect. It also features a higher emphasis on combat than its predecessor, and some of the most frustrating puzzle and enemy design than any other game I’ve played in years. But understand what I mean by that. Warrior Within, for the entire duration, never held my hand. The moment I felt I had a handle on how to deal with an enemy type, a brand new exploding, near unavoidable dog animal thing would be introduced. Obviously, it wasn’t always an exploding dog thing, but you get the point. WW is never easy or gradual in its difficulty. It’s not typically fair, either, but it also never felt impossible, and that’s what made it fantastic. For comparison, while playing Demon’s Souls, I always felt in control of what I was doing, and typically only died if I was quick to run into a room before checking for barriers to hide behind, traps or tricky enemies in the shadows. WW will put you in a room and deal death unto you until you learn to deal with it, and the experience became infinitely rewarding upon besting said situations. Puzzles don’t quite follow the same degree of difficulty that the combat does, but the challenge comes in unintended traversal. By puzzles, I refer to the Prince of Persia’s method of travel; running along walls, sliding down ropes and hanging banners, and avoiding the many, many spikes and saw blades inexplicably sticking out of walls. The open world aspect of Warrior Within allows you to re-visit any portion of the island that you’ve previously visited, and you don’t necessarily have to follow the same paths. However, the design of these pathways are sometimes altered by the game’s events, and even when they aren’t, traversal in any way different from the standard is a challenge in and of itself, as the developers clearly did not design these paths to be easily followed backwards (or forwards, for that matter), as you will have to do. Worse yet, enemy spawns remain, especially those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dogs I mentioned previously, the ones that can take half of your health. If this sounds frustrating to you, it should. But by the point you should even be considering doing anything like this, you will have already become invested in beating down this seemingly personal hell that the developers have created just for you.I won’t divulge any of my secrets for passing through Warrior Within, and quite frankly, I would recommend any and all to refrain from guides as much as possible throughout (except for the collectibles, you’ll need a guide for those). Warrior Within is a truly brutal and often unfair achievement in sadistic game design. It’s also one of my most satisfying completions in the entirety of my gaming career. Nearly every instance of combat in this title will chew on your face and kick you in your ♥♥♥ until you really learn to play it. The learning curve can be steep and unfair, and you will want to quit. Don’t. There are no tricks to Warrior Within, and only your skill, and hopefully a share of dumb luck, will see you succeed. What faults it has, of which there are plenty, only add to the experience.			"

Overall, it glitches a little from time to time, but it still holds its own in terms of gameplay, even with dated graphics. It is a great game.Ubisoft, if you are out there, revamp this PoP trilogy!			"

												The second part of the amazing Prince of Persia trilogy. This time it's a whole lot different kind of adventure. No more fancy palace and no more romance in the air. This game tells you a different story. Prince of Persia: Warrior Within is an excellent game that reveals its greatness as you progress. It starts off a bit run of mill with our moody hero slicing up bad guys, but things take a turn for the best when you get to the island. From here on it's a mind bending challenge after mind bending challenge - each more well thought out and engrossing than the last.The graphics are very dark and atmospheric and the gameplay is great too. The Prince feels nice to control as he runs across walls, swings on poles and does tons of cool acrobatic tricks.They made some huge changes to the fighting system. Now there are lots of combos and even enviormental kills. Now you can grab and throw enemies off ledges and over them.The voice acting seems worse to me.  Especially because Yuri Lowenthal's voice is gone. The music is very different from the first game. This time it's all rock and metal, which I didn't really like. Because I'm not a fan of such. But it was necessary. The game forces you to run away from an dark, terrifying guardian of time named Dahaka. And the music is chosen well for this part of the game. The game looks and feels awesome. The plot is a sick sticky web that makes you think fast and act faster. New powers and weapons are always nice to see in a game. And trust me, there are a lot of weapons here. Especially because the Prince can now Dual Wield. Lots of secret areas, just like the first game. And some awesome hidden weapons too. You'll have to stray off course in order to find them. Prince of Persia: Warrior Within is a challenging and fun game. It requires brawn, brains and an appreciation of wicked looking island. It doesn't beat the first game, but still...10/10 "

												Combat and overall gameplay has been significantly improved over The Sands of Time. It makes for challenging and continuously engaging fight sequences broken up by exploring reliably beautiful environments. I can recommend Warrior Within because the combat in it's predecessor was in dire need of refinement and this game meets those needs thoroughly. However, I want to know exactly what was going through Ubisoft's collective heads when they thought changing the light hearted, funny, and romantic tone of The Sands of Time to the angry and serious tone in Warrior Within was a good idea. If you enjoyed the characterization and storytelling from the first game then you'll be sad to hear that neither of which make any sort of return in this game. However, If good combat and thrilling visuals sells it to you, then Warrior Within is certainly worth a look.			"

You can just play each game over and over again. Its really a classic.+ The graphics (For the year each game came out) are good! Its really well made.+ The control system and gameplay system are totally amazing! (Highly recommended to play on the PS2, with a PS controller.)+ The story behind each game is very cool and good.+ The soundtracks are really good.This game is highly recommended, Its very fun and it worth every cent.

												This is my favorite Prince of Persia installment. While the creator of Prince, Jordan Mechner, might not like the dark and somewhat brutal approach to the series, me and many other Prince's fans do and there are reasons for it. The developers just did the work well. The level design is nice and entertaining and the setting in the dark castle is beautiful. Another highlight of Warrior Within is the combat system with many awesome looking and effective combos. You'll feel it when you try it.If you're a fan of Prince or some other platforming/fighting games (like Lara Croft, for example), try the game.			"

												Amazing game, the best in SoT series in my opinion! It's still entertaining even though it's old and has poor graphics and doesn't support widescreen resolutions.The only bug I encountered - I couldn't perform a long wall jump. Turns out, the cause was that the game was running at 150-200fps. I enabled V-Sync and the bug disappeared. The game certainly wasn't tested under such conditions back in the day:)			"

												At first you might look at how many hours I've played this game. It's kinda misleading, and that's why I wanted to start with the fact, that I've played this game on the PS2 since I was a kid, and I still play till this day because I love it so much. I will just start with the finishing line. I DO recommend this game to ANYONE who is a fan of the Prince of Persia series. IMO this is actually the best one in the whole franchise. It has everything - the prince's acrobatic capabilities (parkour, if you wanna call it like that), loads of fighting/combat combo's, a huge amount of different enemies to face during the whole gameplay, amazing sites and the list could go on forever. Personally I just love this franchise, that's why I'm recommending this game, but this game is just suited for anyone. There are so many puzzles to solve during the game for those seeking some ""brain using"" gameplay, and so many secrets to reveal about the prince himself.Well of course I should also mention about the soundtrack, which is amazing as well (DUH). They really nailed it by using some really nice metal music (especially Godsmack's tracks).20 Empresses out of 10, best game of the decennia.EDIT: After playing it on the PC for a bit, I noticed quite late that the resolution is square, and you have black lines on the sides(YES, that's how much I got into the game, that didn't even notice those lines). There is actually some kind of mod, that you can find in the steam discussions, which helps you put your own resolution, but it's not flawless as well. Nothing relevant will be lost during the gameplay, but you'll get used to it soon.			"

												the first one was great and this one is even much better the story and the powers of the dagger are also present in this game but the combat in the first game which was repetitive was improved in this one it became so good you'll never be bored of it and i liked the parts where the Dahaka chases you and the best thing is that it became more mature than the first one showing the dark side of the prince which i found really cool in the end loved the gameplay loved the characters and loved the story awesome gamethis game is twice what the original was. PoP SoT was explore, slash, explore, slash etc etc. Combat and exploration were almost completey separate. In Warrior Within the two are seamlessly put together to give you a more realistic and combined experience.  This game and its trilogy will always be my all time favorite.. Gj Ubisoft.  "

												About once a decade I seem to stumble upon a game that changes my life, both spiritually and literally, and those would be GTASA and Skyrim, but this game is one of a lifetime, you should care little for the oppinion of the critics, ( random ex. this is what Terminator 2 is to the first movie). Nietzsche's spirit meets Jack London's Love of Life, the grandour of antiquity entwined with the exotic and the mystic, the will, the spirit and the demonic manifested carnally so eloquently, the brooding and the brutal is so voluptously enhanced by the colors and THOSE CRIMSON curtains and clothing, the combat (although somewhat easy, it's varied) makes you feel like the sweetest wine of the gods washes your lips when you slice through the demons (the executioners' excel at that) mercilessly. Do I have to say anything about Stuart Chatwood's and Inon Zur soundtrack? You, as the Prince, take down golems, carelessly murder the provoking, seducing and manipulative women (here's a model for manly self-control), and then fight the incarnation of fate and win. Now capture how empowering this is, and as  much as it seems slightly unrealistic, and the game certainly has flaws, it is perfect for it's time, and holds an idea, a whole concept never so beautifully presented. (you should only play the game on hard).			"

												Completed this game twice (on both endings) when I was a kid, which was ten years ago.Re-bought now on steam, I see this game has still it's charm!Simple & smooth movement, deep combat with combos & fancy moves, and looooong story playtime, with dark, almost sadistic atmosphere.Even though I don't listen to metal, it really fits this game.Graphics are OK. Animations of fire are somehow too fast, and you need to play with VSYNC on, otherwise you will have some problems due to high FPS value. BUT that's nothing major to worry about.Difficulty - this game can be brutal for newbies. Even frustrating at certain times. But, unlike some other games, this one is highly SKILL based. It's not random - everything can be done without harm. It just depends on your skills, really.10/10			"

												You know, this game is kind of the black sheep of the franchise (a franchise that might I add, has been ignored stupidly when it's one of the best Ubisoft has). If you ask fans about it they'll either tell you they love it or they hate it, there doesn't seem to be a middle ground. However I do find it a great game, and as I usually do with my reviews, I'm gonna start with the negative aspects of the game first.First and foremost, the biggest problem this game has are the glitches and bugs. It's no secret that Ubisoft ♥♥♥♥s up their newer releases but their old games are no strangers to that as well. This game still has quite the number of graphic bugs, collision detection, glitched physics and other crap you might think of. And sure, some are useful like the wall-running glitch that can let you extend your wall-running distance effortlessly, but others are a pain in the ♥♥♥ that will cause a game over on you, such as going through the floor. It's quite shameful that Ubisoft hasn't and will never fix these mistakes, really. I will also add that the game has no Steam support what-so-ever.Second, this is something that you can see a lot on Ubisoft games, from both the new and old. If you pick the Hard difficulty, all that will change is the HP of enemies and how much damage they do to you. Come on, that's not difficulty, that's artificial difficulty. And it sucks. Honestly, ignore the Hard difficulty. I went through the game with it and it just makes the game worse, specially when bosses just have too much health and deal too much, while Easy difficulty is programmed for babies.Third is something that's not a problem with me, but with lots of fans: the setting itself. You see, Sands of Time had a lot of charm on it's style, it was told like a fairy tale and didn't really have much violence; it had a bigger focus on the puzzles and platforming than in combat. Warrior Within flips it over, there's barely any puzzles anymore, platforming has been reworked and it's still there, but combat got a gigantic overhaul and it's the bigger focus. It also went from a faily tale to a violent game in which the main character decapitates, cuts in half and utterly murders most of what's on his way in overly cool ways while the music goes from persian-like music to edgy hard-rock/metal. As I said, it's not really a problem for me, but I know for a fact that a lot of people disliked this game because of it, and you should be aware of it.Lastly, I can't help it but to think the two female characters in the game got stupidly sexualized for no reason what so ever. Specially Shadde of whatever her name is, literally the first time you see her, it's her gigantic ♥♥♥ taking most of the screen. What the ♥♥♥♥.However, looking away from those problems what we got left is a pretty solid platforming game that had some seriously fun combat mechanics, a decent story and catchy music.The map is pretty cool, and I've always been a fan of it. In the Sands of Time you always went forward and would most likely never visit most of those places again; that ain't happening here, as the Island of Time and it's gigantic damn fortress is well connected and you'll be going from one place to the other. It's sort of like an open world with it's own mini-hub area connecting them all, which I like, andit doubles as good for having both present and past versions of almost all areas, which is really cool when you finally do notice which ones are the same on different times. Though I must question what kind of sense do all of those places make in an in-game prespective, it's impossible to go from one side to the other unless you're some sort of acrobatic monster like the Prince.I've always liked the story of this game, it's not too deep to get lost on it but it does entertain during the 7-10 hours it takes to go through it. It also likes to make you question what's going on early and give you hints of what happened, and incase you didn't catch it, answer them later near the end. And having two different endings is also cool, the other games also needed something like that.The combat is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing Badass. Tons of combos, plenty of weapons, a cluster♥♥♥♥ of ways to deal with an enemy, and it's also quite ♥♥♥♥ing violent and fun to watch. It's certainly a gigantic step-up from The Sands of Time, and I wish Ubisoft didn't just copy it on the sequel (which had almost all the same moves but the gameplay was more stealth focused, which just didn't feel right).The music, while edgy as hell and really different from the previous game, feels quite fitting in here. The atmosphere is really dark and gritty, having hard-rock/metal for half the soundtrack does wonders. Do I recommend this game? Certainly. However be aware of two things: First, the price. Ubisoft usually sucks at pricing and a game this old is kinda expensive at it's current price. On a big sale though, it's a great purchase. Second, that you should totally play The Sands of Time first if you haven't yet. Otherwise you won't understand ♥♥♥♥.TL;DR Edition: Great mix between platforming and action-based gameplay with plenty of violence and metal to go along with it. Sure it's edgy as all ♥♥♥♥ but it's also really fun. Story is decent and catchy, the map got a lot of detail, only big negative points being the God-damn bugs.			"

And a good successor to the previous game. The story is much darker this time as is shown by both art style and music. This time around it feels less like a fairy tale and more like and action movie. The combat has improved which I found great although the puzzles are weaker this time around. Notable due to lack of Farah co-op levels. The parkour is AGAIN flawed by the weird camera shifting that makes running hard. Mostly during the Dahaka chase scenes. Speaking of these - apart from the camera they are awesome. They include an epic soundtrack and the game really pumps you up to try to get away from the monster. I guess it balances out the fact that there is MUCH more fighting and less jumping around in WW. The boss fights are cool but very punishing so be prepared. There are secrets which you can unlock and if get all of them a water sword appears and you get a different ending! This I thought to be cool because the final fight is then totally different too. Worth mentioning is that the game runs well but there is a glitch now and then. You can see the main design focus is elsewhere but while I find the previous game to be better I still like this one a lot and recommend it!			"

												I got this game when I purchased my very first Nvidia gforce video card.I still keep the disc.After finishing the Two Thrones I realized that the ending I got when I beat the Warrior Within was not the desired one (it was bad ending).And playing now I realized that I missed one of the life upgrades and I must play it again.I will gladly do it in spite of glorious Dahaka and annoying glitches.Edit : I just defeated Daha with hockey stick :).This was one of the hardest and most intense moments for me.Dahaka has shown great respect for Prince and it was honor to challange him.Respect for him and his duty.Rest in peace Guardian.

												Prince of Persia: Warrior Within is the sequel to The Sands of Time. The game returns back with the same familiar controls and gameplay but this time the combat has taken a massive overhaul. There are tons of combos and new attack moves and even secondary weapons to pick up. You also revisit many of the same areas over and over with the time changing from past to present so at times it feels like you're just doing the same thing over and over. Overall though it's a worthy sequel that just improves the combat while keeping the core gameplay unchanged so if you enjoyed the first game then you will enjoy the sequel. Only negatives I can say are the game has turned to use rock music during combat (feels out of place) and also has super annoying game over videos everytime you die. So, make sure to delete the game's intro videos and Game Over videos (GO_.bik in Videos folder).			"

												The Bronze Egg of the trilogy, easily the most buggy and difficult.It's like they had some sort of quality control crisis, because some things are noticeably crude compared to Sands of Time, like some visuals, sounds, and then theres the glitches. The glitches usually consist of sometimes buggy as hell parkouring, I.E. I go to the very edge of a beam, jump, and end up hover glitching over the end of the other beam, either barely making it, or falling to my death. Then theres some random sound glitches, well at least the glitches in general are sometimes worth a laugh.This sequel has an incredibly emo tone, a ton of new combat moves and combos, a switchable secondary weapon which has durability and can be thrown, a bunch of new enemies, and an evil OCD demon 10 times scarier than Nemesis from Resident Evil 3 that chases you down and wants you dead. Its usually a parkour chase when you encounter him, avoid him and parkour correctly, or die horribly. He's not fond of water, so a chase usually ends past a waterfall or something similar.Also, there are some hidden unbreakable secret secondary weapons in some areas, like a Rayman glove you can slap everything to death with? Or a flamingo that probably came from that weird TV show that was in Max Payne.Then theres the Water Sword, a secret primary weapon you can get near the end of the game by doing some akward backtracking and whatnot (this games equivalent of the Master Sword, except optional), and also you need to have found every life upgrade to get it. It also unlocks the game's true boss/ending as well in which you smack a certain nemesis to death with said sword.So if you liked the first game, and don't mind some hilarious glitches and incredibly annoying dog demons that explode, give this a try.

												A very fun game. The mix of parkour and combat is very well done and it feels so good to slow mo chop an enemies head off.  The story line in my opinion is pretty ok but nothing that will bring tears to your eyes because it is so great. The dark appearance and music does a good job of setting a mood of suspence and danger, as if you are being chased (which you are). There are many secrets that with some effort you can find adding a nice little alternitive than just following the main plot all the way. There are many weapons to find and because The Prince is now wielding two weapons there are some nice combos to be had. The controls are also fluent and well done. However just becasue you are fighting doesnt mean that you just hack and slash your way through, there are many interesting puzzles that add a great element to the game. The game also has decent graphics but you must remember this game is from around 2004 so it is not what you are used to in todays games. Overall this game is VERY FUN and what really does it for me is the great combat, puzzle and parkour mixture. 9/10			"

												A worthy sequel to the sands of time, it’s not as good as the first game but it does so many great things on it’s own that it still makes it an excellent game. I wasn’t a big fan of the change of tone from the first game but they do make it work by the premise of the game, the idea of the dahaka and the idea of the island of time etc. A big part of what makes it work is the amazing soundtrack that still holds up so well, I don’t see the game being as good as it is without the soundtrack. I really like the story in the game, I think it is a very cool time travel story but it’s just not as well written and well told as the sands of time is and the characters are nowhere near as good as they are in the first game. The prince himself is almost a completely different person in this game and he is nowhere near as likable or interesting as he was in the original. Still I can’t deny how entertaining the story is and clever at some points too. The combat is really good, the sand powers can be overpowered at times but it doesn’t take away from the fun of the combat. I love the layout and design of the island itself it’s a very cool location to explore and platform across. They could have reduced the amount of backtracking there is though. Overall I think this game still holds up extremely well today.9/10 (Amazing)			"

												It's been about 12 years since I've last completed this game.

And in fact I didn't need to.It might just be me, but I remember every plot twist and location the game had to offer, The soundtrack is still in my playlist and the story shaped my ideology on certain things.All around an amazing game with an excellent story and gameplay (especially for 2004).

												I bought this game way back in 2005 when I was a 12 year old kid and it was the best thing I've played at the time.Decided to pick this up again on Steam in 2016 and I do not regret this at all. Pros:- amazing soundtrack (seriously, I'd sit in the main menu just to hear the track out)- great fighting mechanics- classical platforming returns from Sands of Time with upgrades- a less cheesy story than Sands of Time- a more hardcore experience - it is much less linear than both Sands of Time and The Two Thrones because you can return to certain locations on the island at will to find secrets- you can have a teddy bear as a weapon- dat ♥♥♥Cons:- funky wall running mechanics sometimes - you'll end up running along the wall instead of up the wall and die, so basically the camera angles aren't the best at times but they are fine 90% of the time.Overall the best Prince of Persia game out of the 3 original ones. Sands of Time had very boring fighting mechanics, and The Two Thrones kind of strayed from the Warrior Within formula a little.			"

												Having played all prince of Persia games, I think this is one of the better ones, but not the best. And the reason why it isn't is because of how the saving works. A mechanic that is so badly done it destroys the enjoyment of this game.Despite its age the graphics hold up. Not because of the latest state of the art graphics obviously, but because it fits the game and there is nothing detracting from it. The art style is also superb with interesting locations and beautiful vistas. The only gripe is that there is only a 4:3 ratio and not 16:9. I believe you can mod it, but I think the game breaks slightly if you do. The story is nothing to write home about and often feels very cheesy and videogame-cringeworthy. You know, bad lines and scantily clad women with enormous boobs. It just feels way to forced and out of place.If you are familiar with the game -series, you'll find great platforming and puzzles in this one as well. This is probably the most challenging game in the whole series. Puzzles are truly difficult at times, and you don't always know where to go. You do have a map, but it is not particularly helpful. I found myself going down the wrong path quite a few times because It is not obvious where you are going next, especially if you have not played the game for a while.The combat is the best in the series. Lots of variety, ""different weapons"", many combos, tight controls and fun game-play. You can even use the environment a bit. It works great with mouse and keyboard, but I also found that a controller (a little fiddling to get it working properly) worked quite well.This is all good. But what eventually makes this game the only one I have never completed(!), is how the saving works, and what happes when you die. You can only save at certain locations and there is no autosave. So what? That is normal of older games. Well, it takes quite a while to save (first he drinks for quite a while, then you go in to a menu asking if you want to save, then you get asked where to save, and then ok etc - a lot of small steps to save that feels really tedious after a while). Also, these save locations are sparse, especially later in the game. Which means that you might have to go through a bunch of difficult puzzles, beat monsters, and oops 15 minutes later you died and guess what, you have to redo all that again. If you find the boss and/or monsters hard you have to redo that quite a few times. The problem is that you have to redo all of it, not just the part you find difficult.This is absolutely hair-pullingly frustrating. It is not fun to replay 10-15 minutes of platform puzzles (that sometimes are quite difficult) and then you die to the next section of monsters or bosses. Sometimes the game seems to aknowledge this problem and you don't always start over at your last savepoint, but at a specific points in the game. But this doesn't happen often enough. This really feels unfair when the camera and/or controls can be the fault of your death or you might not know where to go. And the whole ""you died"" screen animation... It seems silly to bring up, but the whole experience from pressing the wrong button, or perhaps not seeing what is going on because of bad camera angles, then dying in slowmotion, getting the ""you died screen"" that is just a tad too long and you can't skip it, then going back to load your game and realizing you just lost a bunch of progress... - it all ads up, and takes too long to be fun.It is a shame because it really is a good game otherwise, and could have been one of the better ones. But now I would say it is the 3rd or 4th in the series because of this problem, because your overall experience is more frustrating than fun. Otherwise it has it all, great combat, nice platforming, bosses, good puzzles and a great theme and art style.Also, the music is not the best. They were going for some kind of tough rock-style. While I don't mind that kind of music, it just doesn't fit as well in this game and also feels rather repetitive.I still reckommend this game, but only for the die-hard fans who enjoys a little torture and no hand-holding.

												If you use a controller, then you MUST go through and change ALL the buttons. The person in charge of mapping the controls decided the face buttons are for moving the camera, and the start button is block. Fix this immediatly. Other than stupid mapping, the controls are fabulous, and the game controls as smoothly as possible. It's a stunning game too, with great and nicely detailed enviornments. As for the gameplay, I can't say too much. (Mostly since I made this review to warn people about the bad controls. But so far, it's a game I am swiftly falling in love with.)			"

												It's nowhere near as good as the first game, but it's by no means bad. The platforming is still great, but it's bogged down by a lot of tedious fighting. The enemies in this game have way more health than they need to, and they constantly surround and stun-lock you. It sucks. The story isn't anywhere as good as the first game either. It's a lot darker in tone, and most of the dialogue is comically bad. The game doesn't seem to have proper Xinput compatibility either. It can't detect both shoulder triggers being pulled at the same time. For this reason I couldn't do any of the special moves for half of the game until I realized, since I had action and recall set to the triggers. If you have this problem you might want to bind them to something else like the shoulder buttons instead, or download Xinput Plus and fix it that way.It's hard to give this a solid recommendation. If it weren't for the platforming then I probably would have given this a thumbs down instead. If you really liked Sands of Time then give it a go. Maybe play on Easy so you won't have to endure a ton of sh*tty fighting. "

												I see improvement from previous one. Great BGM. And collections to achieve.You can actually flee from most of enemies.1.	But still it has terrible control, the prince usually don’t do what I want him to do, especially the right click function. They remove the disarm function. That means every time the prince meets an enemy, he must faces it and disables climbing and other stuff.2.	And limit camera, sometimes I can’t move my camera angle. So that it works terribly on the balance system because I don’t even know which button I should pressThese two main problems are also found in the previous one. In the way, it is still sucks in 2014 standard. I would say 3 out of 10But the game worth 2.49 US$ (Previous one doesn’t, by the way)			"

												At first I would recommend this game. But having beat it now, I look back, I actually kinda maybe  ♥♥♥♥ing hated playing this game. ok i have finished sands of time and i have played a little forgotten sands. warrior within, definitely the worst. Its better than sands of time in the aspect that the combat has gotten a little better (still pretty similar, except you don't need to absorb people anymore cause you don't have the dagger of time). But your overall experience is impedied by the -unfairness of the combat (if you fall to the floor, enemies can still repeatedly hurt you making it impossible to get up).- getting sands is much rarier in this game- UNBELIEVABLY repeatative, like the game is pretty long already without having to go back through places 3 times for no reason. seriously Prince has the worst sense of planning, you go to one side of the castle and then have to go all the back like 3 times. and its not like an open map, these are closed rooms and hall ways. and the objective and enemies are the same. exactly the same. it gets excrutiatingly boring.- the glitcheness, i don't think this is my computer, if it is then i retract this one. but there were times where i would be running a rope on a wall, and i would just stop and stick to the wall, having to waste a precious sand tank (seriously ♥♥♥♥♥ hard to get) to get off. other glitches happened as well, especially annoying when fighting, but it is an old game, and it didn't happen too frequently. and im sure there are other things that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off about this game, but seriously, its late, i just finished the game and i got uni tomorrow or should i say later today. so onto the confusing things.like any game, movie, comic, manga, book, etc. when time travel is included, plot holes are created. warrior within is pretty solid none the less. Another confusing point, the emo'ish half/skantly/wearingnothingbutblackbraandpanties women that attack you.... is it really necessary for them to moan and scream in plessure and talk about pleasure and many sexual things as they stab you repeatedly, i mean come on, mixed signals. and they mount your back as well, and your like hell yea, but then they stab you. like way to lead the Prince on. But seriously, people in rooms next to me might get the wrong idea, i mean my porn doesn't have any pain fetish in it at all! and it is soo out of place, like there are giant monsters and then these half naked ladies getting off on killing you. like did the empress of time when hiring these people be like... hmm yea i kinda like the giant armored monsters, lets just have 2 or 3 of these guys... but lets blow our how employment budget on these stripper demons. maybe Prince walked into the wrong castle, he actually walked into a big ♥♥♥ brothel, i mean that would have been a great twist end. Im gonna put this as a recommend anyway, cause the prince of persia is a good series, and i have had some fun. if there are others like me just playing through the series, you gotta get past this one anyway. the combat was pretty cool at times, cool acrobatic ♥♥♥♥.

												This game never gets old. it's a must have. great story, nice graphics, very good voice acting. if i had the sands of time, i'd go back to play this game for the first time again. Oh wait, it doesn't matter because you'll never get tired of replaying it and will always give you the same goosebumps!			"

												Continue the epic story of our prince as he delves into the darkness in both rage and despair, working to undo the cruel fate done unto him and crush all those whom seek to stand in his way. Two blades promise twice the death, as you whirl like a storm of steel and rip the life from monsters whom threaten your life. The puzzles are intricate, but not incredibly challenging, and the soundtrack is an interesting project that I definitely enjoyed.			"

												Warrior Within is the first sequel to Ubisoft's 2003 Sand of Time, taking place third Chronologically right after 2010's The Forgotten Sands. As I had said before SoT was an almost perfect game, with amazing story, unrivaled scenery, and perfect character arcs. Everything that lacked in that game this one improved, such as combat. However the once brown-haired insecure Daddy's boy Prince that was in the orginal is buried under a ♥♥♥♥♥♥-off emo hiding behind his black flowing hair and facial scars. The game is not bad in any sense of the word, besides the horrible bugs that could cause you to skip ten hours of gameplay and be doomed to re-do or the most difficult battles in the series.. It's just darker and grittier, makes sense since he killed his own brother and been hunted like an animal ever since by the Dahaka. If youre a fan of SoT it's worth the buy.			"

												A great instalment in the series! I think this game upped the difficulty, which was essential after the Sands of Times which was a little easy at times. However, I do think the game took a few step backs from the Sands of Time. The first being the tone, I personally felt the dark tone of the game was completely unnecessary and the game could of easily gotten away with a lighter tone. Also, I find the change of the Prince’s voice completely off-putting. I have no idea why they changed it but it was the completely wrong decision. Also, his personality was a little too extreme at times. I could not imagine the SOT calling anyone a ‘♥♥♥♥♥’. Yes, it’s meant to be years later and this and that happened. Though the developer chose to make all that happen to make him ‘dark and edgy’ in the first place, I’d rather them of not. Apart from those issues the rest of the game was extremely strong and built upon the gameplay I loved from the Sands of Time.  "

												Warrior Within is a worthy sequel to the great Sands of Time. The story continues seven years after the events in the Sands of Time with the Prince of Persia as he sets out to find the Empress who created the sands... of time. His goal is to stop her and change his fate. In the first game, after stabbing the hourglass with the Dagger of Time, the Prince had released the Sands and changed the timeline. Due to this, he has been constantly hunted down by the Dahaka, an inevitable being of fate which, by killing the Prince, could correct the timeline and the Prince's fate. That is why the Prince embarks to the Island of Time to confront the Empress, to change his fate permanently.One of the more notable aspects of Warrior Within is how violent it is. The tone is much dark than it's predecessor and even the levels are grimier. But the platforming, bar hopping, ledge jumping, wall running, etc; it's all still there. And still just as fun. But what's even more notable about this game is the element of time travel. The plot gets really interesting about 3/4ths of the way through when various mysteries are uncovered and pieces are put together by the prince. His development and keen insight were a joy to watch throughout.One last thing, make sure you get all nine life upgrades to get the water sword for the alternate ending, which in reality is the canonical ending that continues into The Two Thrones. Plus it's so much more rewarding than the regular ending.Anyway, great game, but my only major complaint might be the drastic changes in music, from the Middle-eastern styled orchestral to the guitar driven metal. Not a fan of the metal use in this game. Oh, and I guess more PC options would have been nice. A few bugs. No other complaints really.9.1/10			"

												The follow-up to Sands of Time, this installment has better graphics and improved combat.  It certainly is sexier than the first game.  However, Ubisoft decided to make this one darker and bloodier, which makes it lose the feel-good adventuring of the first game.  That makes this one my least favorite of the trilogy, but still very good and worth playing.			"

												 I must start by saying Warrior Within is my least favorite of the trilogy. I played the entire series back in the day and recently purchased them again while they were on sale. The graphics are obviously dated but what do you expect it's and old game, the problem lies with the rest of the game.  The soundtrack in my opinnion doesn't really do anything besides prevent awkward silence (which there is still a lot of) and personally I don't think the music really fits the game. The gameplay is alright, the game itself can be enjoyable but the plot isn't really that great compaired to the other games.   The major problem with the plot is that if you jump from the first game Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time to this you won't really know what's going on, from my understanding this game continues off of a side game created for the ds. That's a pretty bad idea in my oppinion, but after a short while you understand what's going on but will most likely wish there was some more detail on what happened inbetween the two games. But I do give the game a little bit of props for having a little replayability by having an alternative ending. The alternative ending is what leads to the beginning of The Two Thrones so I do reccomend getting all the life upgrades. The game suffers through a few annoyences, for example throughout the playthrough you will probably notice that they try and make the game seem badass in every aspect.  Notably music by Godsmack, and a first boss featuring armour that hardly protects her buttcrack. Honestly I think most of the things they put in the game to try and make it ""cool"" just took away from the overall gameplay. But what can I say at least the combat was fun and I always like climbing things, so although it's very far from perfect I reccomend this game but only if you play through the Sand of Time. And if you enjoy the Sands of Time and think this is to stupid so you don't want to try the Two Thrones I will say you should change your oppinion as the Two Thrones is a TON better than this one.

												This is the worst of the Prince of Persia games and it's still really fun. The titular Prince has had his voice replaced by that of someone angrier, so the witty banter is gone. The other characters in this tale are nowhere near as interesting as Farah in Sands of Time. BUT! The platforming that you came here for is still there and the combat is more more complicated but far more interesting.			"

												This game made me rage so much that I should rate it negatively. However, it still is a PoP and overall it's still a ""solid"" game.My main gripes:- Combat is pretty decent this time around, much less getting knocked down and not being able to get up again. That being said, fighting multiple opponents can still often be extremely tricky. Single opponents, however, are fodder.- The bloody camera. I think this is the one thing that caused me the most deaths in this game. It's very difficult to control and does what it wants sometimes, even invert the controls, despite it not being enabled.- Controls are muddy again, the Prince is often not doing what you want him to do. For example, I used a 360 Pad and bound the time button to the left trigger. Well, guess what, that button does not work for the combat time skills, instead I had to rebind the key to another one (left shoulder). Figuring this out was a pain. Another example: Changing direction on a swing pole is left to chance it seems as the Prince sometimes turns and sometimes not. Gladly there are almost no time sensitive jumps in this fashion. You also still need to hold down the action button for all those things to work. Another example: Holding down the direction button to move the Prince forwards does not always result in him going forward, because the game takes the bloody camera angle into account, so instead of just pushing forward on the stick to move a rotating lever, you have to also rotate your stick to move it...*sigh*And my main gripe with the game: The god damn back tracking. I needed 15 hours on easy with a guide to complete this one, I visited some areas 3 or 4 times due to story reasons. You'd better memorize all the areas (in the past and present zones nonetheless) or use a guide. I shudder taking a break for a week or a month from this, coming back and realizing that I have no clue whatsoever where to go and how to get there. The game is an enigma. While it does have a ""map"", it's absolutely useless, as it's just an ""overworld map"" and offers NO details whatsoever. Infuriating.Another gripe: The last portion of the game is, again, just back tracking and repetition, but also extremely trivial. There is almost no way to fail at that stage and combat becomes extremely simplistic.What does it do well then? Well, it's still fun swinging around, the story is interesting and the past/present mechanic is pretty neat. However, the game needed to be streamlined. The last part is for the most part easy to navigate, but the rest? A nightmare. If you want to find all the secrets, prepare to spend even more time with it. Imho it's partially better than Sands of Time, but Forgotten Sands still beats it in terms of accessibility. Warrior Within is hardcore even on easy...			"

												What an unbelievable game. One of the greatest of all time.The story is really nice, it keeps a strong connection with the first one, while it can run as a stand-alone story. Really thrilling and original. The graphics and the atmosphere made a radical change here. From the charming arab palaces of the first game, we will be now in a cursed island, where everything will try to kill us. We will have to fight using the hundres of combo to get rid of the hordes of monster that will follow us, explore downhearted scenarios and try to survive. The castle is just badass, and the atmosphere is really depressive and sadistic.The music is totally awesome. Heavy metal during the fights, depressive dark ambient during the puzzles and exploration stages.Also, the game is ultra gore and violent. Be ready to decapitate and cut in two pieces your enemies, using hundreds of different weapons and combos.A masterpiece. I know some fans were upset because of the radical change from the first game, but really, this game is nuts. Black metal made game.No bugs reported on this version, just some people, like it happened to me, will have this file corrupted: Video\Cine\CINE0102.BIK (inside the folder where the game is installed), that makes the game crash after the very first boss battle. The only way to make the game not crash is to replace this file with its uncorrupted version you can find in cd/dvd version of the game, or you can just download it, as legally as you can, from internet.

Everything (both + and - ) is actually the same.The gameplay became much more diverse - more aggressive, different approaches, swords that really make a difference, a lot of secondary weapons to choose from. Definitely the exact improvement needed.Change in past-present was as satisfying as ever - cannot recall any other game at that time with such concept.The plot is twisted, providing unexpected turns and decisions. At least it was confusing 10 years ago for a 11-year boy.A lot of different bosses, each recquiring a different approach - by far, the greatest addition since the previous game.You can play the game even if you didn't finish the SOT part.

												Look... I guess the game it's fine, I LOVED the first Prince of Persia game (The Sands of Time, not the one from way back in the 90's)But this game really turned a lot of people around, I think with this game, a lot of people got very upset with the developers for two reasons:A) They expected the game to carry with the same ""tone"" from the first game, this game in exchange it's dark, gritty, obscure, gory, etc...And...B) A lot of people dislike how tedious the game gets near the end.Everything ranging from the puzzles to the combat, to the enemies, everything later in the game takes a turn for the worse, the entire pacing of the game gets ruined once that you start having multiple bosses show up continually from one, and another, then you have the game sinking the player in confusing sections where you need to backtrack to specific places around the game, the game has a map which I guess it's supposed to make this complaints nonexistent. but here's the thing, the game's map doesn't work for me, and frankly, tho I can't confirm it, I suppose the game doesn't have anything more than a very basic map that just looks like an early concept art of certain parts around the game, but doesn't really explain where you need to go.Which really takes me up to the next problem that I have.The freaking pc port of this game is a mess, the game lacks basic graphic options, something understandable because of the games age, but tedious nonetheless, the game doesn't open up when clicking on ""play"" inside Steam, instead it throws a screen showing my system specs (24gb ram, gtx 970, i5 6600k), that obviously surpass the system requirements from the game, but since the game doesn't recognize this specs, it simply doesn't allow me to launch my game.In order to fix this I had to go to the main folder of the game, and launch the game directly from there, while simultaneously keeping the ""launcher"" with my system specs, running in the background.It's the only way I got to run the game.In order to then use my controller, increase the resolution to my screens native one, and skip the five minute cutscenes, I had to download patches, rebind keys, and delete some folders inside the game's directory. It was a process that took me around forthy minutes or so, but it was tedious and more importantly, it was relatively quick, because I knew where to look. (Thank you pcgamingwiki)After that...It's a fun game, the puzzles and the combat are great for the most part, climbind around and avoiding deathtraps it's enjoyable and fun, but then the game takes some design choices that in the name of ""challenge"" end up making the game extremely tedious to play, stuff like getting chased around by an enemy that you have to outrun, only getting the ability to ""correct"" your mistakes by using a limited supply of ""sands of time"" which allow you to go back to a specific position before you made whatever mistake got you killed in the first place, only to then having the limited supply of sands of time being the biggest problem of your playthrough, then some enemies that dodge each and every single one of your attacks, or block most of them, while they have attacks that ""break"" your defence...It just gets up to a point in which the game breaks it's own flow and ends up making the playing of it, tedious, and annoying, and eventually a section that would usually take you half an hour to complete, ends up taking you two, or three, and then it becomes tedious and annoying, and that frightening question that comes up in a game that clearly bothers you shows it's head.Is it worth it?And I don't think it is, the game might have been an incredible game before, and maybe if you can look past the terrible design choices that the game carries, and how horribly some of them have aged, with a terrible camera that switches in the most inconvinient moment making you fall to your death, then maybe you can find some enjoyment from beginning to end, but this is a game that hasn't aged well, I don't mean the graphics...Who cares about the graphics of a twelve year old game?But...It is a game that has design choices, and mechanics, that games have actively been trying to avoid, specifically because of how frustrating they can be.And I just don't like that, sorry...

												I used to love this game so much, but unfortunately, I can't recommend it to anyone with a current system for gaming. It's just so infuriatingly glitchy, that you constantly keep dying because the character falls through the map, grabs the air a half meter away from the ledge then falls, etc. However, the level design, the fights and the atmosphere are so masterfully created that you might be able to live with its many technical shortcomings. For me, the real dealbreaker was the presence of many game-breaking bugs. Basically, these glitches prevented me from proceeding in any direction so after some time I had to quit playing. It's a real shame though, because this was an amazing game in its time.			"

												Though the story is not bad... the combat makes the game tedious, repetitive and boring.The plataforming, puzzle solving and extras hidden though the game are nice, worthy of a game of its name, but that is just half the game, the other half is the combat mechanics. You either combat the same 3 enemy type (with increasing health as they get reskinned as you progress) OR you battle a boss with cheap moves that will force you to defend the whole time until it does one of the few moves you can actually counter attack without risk and chip health  painfully slowly. The most exciting parts are the sections where the Dahaka chases you, but they are few and far between.Had to drop the game because I got tired of the enemy monotony, also, hard difficulty just adds more health to the enemies... making it even more of a chore rather than actually making combat challenging.

												As much as I try to love this game, it is so full of bugs that I've spent more time being angered/frustrated by glitches than actually having fun.Seems like it was pronounced complete as soon as 1 game tester managed to successfully completed it. By shere luck, it seems. They knew it and released it anyway.I love the dark setting, Godsmack inspired soundtrack, the cheap but effective idea of playing same level in 2 different timelines. Even the extremely cheesy dialogue. But after spending past 2 hours trying to climb down a simple wall in Tower Activation (past), I've had just about enough. I wish I could get a refund but alas, I've spent too much in-game time already.This makes me sad as, game-breaking bugs/glitches aside, this would easily be my favorite installment of PoP. But the release was rushed before sufficient playtesting, and apparently no effort was made to fix any bugs after the game was released. "

												I remember this was as a quite good game but unfortunately I can't recommended this game right now because it is broken. There is a possibility to play this game but it crashes from time to time several times in the same place and this is also big disadvantage that you cannot save the game when you want to but only in the specific places.

												I remember liking this game as a kid. Unfortunately, no amount of nostalgia can make up for how truly awful this game is.By far the biggest issue with the game is over-emphasis on combat. The combat is so repetitive and unsatisfying that you'll look for every opportunity to skip it in order to continue with the platforming elements of the game. On hard mode at least, the enemies have way too much hp, and you can easily find yourself repeating the same attack patterns over and over literally a dozen or more times before the enemy finally falls. And god forbid you're trapped in a group of several enemies. For some reason most of your moves have next to no block recovery, which means you're taking damage one way or another. Even properly timed counter-attacks can result in the enemy still hitting you.Another major issue is the game is just way too hard for its own good. By midway through the game you're begging for every save point that comes your way. Not only does the game not feature a save-anywhere feature, its checkpoints are virtually nonexistent. This means sometimes you'll lose entire minutes of progress because of a platforming mistake.Speaking of platforming, it is actually quite good for the most part, very much up-to-par with what you get in the original Sands of Time. However, you'll often get lost and frustrated because of the game's terrible camera angles and misguided use of an open world design that has you backtracking through several areas.Probably the most aggravating thing about the game is that it's clearly rushed / unfinished. There's a lot of gameplay and graphical glitches that are surprisingly easy to trigger through normal gameplay. Even the way the prince lands on certain beams can provoke glitches where he temporarily appears to be landing on some different type of platform.Even little details about the game will tend to ♥♥♥♥ you off. For example, there are time travel portals you can activate. Each portal has 4 switches you have to press to activate them and the order is random. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. It creates a meaningless guessing game each time and feels utterly pointless.Whereas the original game feels polished and has a certain charm, this one is just an incomplete mess. The wholy gritty, badass prince vibe they were going with this game falls flat on its face, and is borderline cringy at times.I can't believe I'm saying this, but even Forgotten Sands is a better game. I would barely place this game above Prince of Persia 2008.			"

												Like its predecessor, the camera and controls are horrendous. Unlike its predecessor, no story or characters to care about. Ubisoft phoned this one in with redundent levels, no character development, and music best heard with volume levels set to zero. I had hoped the problems with SoT would not carry over.This will be the first game I ever purchased that will deleted before finishing along with Thrones and Forgotten Sands as I can only assume they will suck as bad and will not be worth the space on my hard drive. Thankfully they only cost $5.00 each. About $5.00 too much. Steam, can get my money back on this ♥♥♥♥♥?

												All charm and wit of Sands of Time were gutted living a disgusting shell that lost track of what made its predecessor good.Terrible camera, unresponsive controls, a refocusing on combat, a puerile shift to a darker grittier story including immature reduction of the female supporting characters to wearing oversexualized butt-floss outfits (thankfully they removed the fun and witty Farah rather than make her terrible) and a replacement of the middle-eastern music with lame metal. A more open world gameplay rather than making things fun leaves you going over the same bland hard to see jumps over and over as you go in circles thinking you are making forward progress. Also included are many terrible timed sections that compound controller and camera issues to make it a terrible experience.			"

												This is a nasty, boneheaded sequel to a great classic game and its sins are many.  For one, it emphasizes combat far more than the first game while utilizing a fighting system that is more busted than ever; this time the Prince flails around like a stoned acrobat who also happens to be a dead swan, flopping his lanky limbs at everything BUT that which you intend.The combat is not the greatest offender, however.  That honor goes to the level design!  Whereas in the first game you joyfully somersaulted once through each well-designed obstacle course before assailing the next unique level, Warrior sees you slogging repeatedly through the same murky, uninspired switch and saw and pole courses, interminably back and forth, back and forth, until either your sanity departs or you do a rage uninstall, which is what I SHOULD have done.    And for the crap-flavored icing on the carrion cake, the tone has shifted from cool and easy Arabian Nights-style to grunty grimdark BS.  No longer is the Prince a tough yet somewhat sensitive sort (which jived with his incredible acrobatic ability); now he's just some turd with tribal tats who gruffly tells everyone and everything, including ****ing bats, that he will bloodily DESTROY any and all who stand in the way of his legendary sword arm!  Uhhgh!This is garbage, this is trash, this is a poopy old relic that deserves to stay buried forever.  Why did I bother to play through this endless torturefest, acquiring all the life upgrades and getting the ""good"" ending no less?  Chock it up to a bout of extreme self-loathing.  But never again, never again will I waste life and time on something so worthless as this . . . so perhaps I learned something from the experience.			"

												For the first few hours, the game is a tad alienating. Everyone mocks it for the drastic change in tone and the downright bipolar change in the Prince's character. However, once the game gets going, it's very enjoyable. At many points, I found it to be a worthy sequel to Sands of Time.And then the endgame hits.There will be no spoilers, but to those familiar with the structure of storytelling, around the end of the second act, the game design completely soils itself. Glitches are abundant. The controls become even more clunky, and the plot makes even less sense.Sands of Time's narrative might have been overly simplistic, but at least it was consistent. This game is a glitch-riddled, rushed mess.			"

												As a Gamer for about 20 years, playing many games from NES to Ps3, from Dos to Windows, i can honestly say this is the worst game i have ever played in my entire life. i cant fathom how they managed to make a platforming game so damn shallow. You have to be a moron to find this game tasteful. The entire approach of this game is ""Lets add tons of Gore, hip music, and make the prince this dark hero with a bad side and all the kids will buy it""There are annoying repetitive drum and guitar BGM's that constantly play in the background. The map they give you for the island your on is an outdoor photograph of a castle with ""approximate locations"" pinned on it, leaving you to roam aimlessly. The platforming is its only saving grace, which is interupted by boring and tedious combat every 5 minutes. There are plenty of good platformers available out there. Dont let this be your introduction to the genre.You have to time travel back and forth between past and present to solve platforming puzzles. But dont be fooled, this is not one of the princes abilities. you must haul yourself all the way to a room in the castle and activate a platform to change time. Yup. its frustrating too.Let me put it this way. This is not the sandy persian adventure your expecting. its a medieval dungeon crawler with tons of gore. avoid this garbage at all costs. If you have your heart set on Prince of Persia, play the 2008 remake or the forgotten sands and its psp counterpart. The 2 original 2D prince of persia's are great as well as the Fallen King for DS and the iOS and Android remakes. Personally i would say avoid all 3 in the sands of time trilogy. But it is Necassary you avoid Warrior Within and Prince of Persia 3D released in 1999, as these are both a disgrace to the intelligence and respect of real gamers.			"

												Warning: the following review may contain spoilers.Warrior Within has quite a mixed opinion among fans of the Prince of Persia franchise. The negative arguments have some rational points such as the ridiculously skimpy outfits of the two major female characters and, at times, impossible to control camera angles. However there are many arguments made as ""negatives"" despite the fact that they are completely subjective.The dramatic shift in tone from Sands to WW can definitely be unappealing for those who enjoyed the more colorful and lighter aspects of Sands but this is based on opinion, rather than based on quality. The darker and more pale colored environments in WW are actually done quite well as they enforce a more negative attitude without being outright depressing or boring. This is the reaction that the player is supposed to experience, so saying that the dark environments are ""bad"" for not being lighter or more pretty seems illogical. There are also plenty of areas to explore, each with their own theme and personality (so to speak) i.e. the hanging gardens and mechanical tower, but always adhering to the theme of appearing pale and unwelcoming.Another misrepresented point of the game is backtracking - while Sands was a constant adventure that continually sent the prince through various areas and rarely revisiting the same location twice, WW features quite a bit of going back and forth through familiar locations. This is often cited as ""lazy"" level design or ""lack of creativity"" but misses the point that the level designers wanted the world to feel real. I admire the idea of constantly finding new areas to explore but half way through Sands I started to wonder if I was still in Azad or not, WW continues to send you to new places for the majority of the game but also tried to combine these newer areas from the later period of the story into the locations previously visited as it makes the game world feel connected. I must also point out the difference between time periods (past and present) as it allowed the level designers to create two distinct environments in the same location; the distopian present and the glorious past. An idea that I very much admire.Finally we come to one of the biggest issues of WW - the prince. Many fans hated the way his character had changed, going from a young, happy go lucky joker to a more grizzled, vulgar and take no prisoners soldier, stating that they come off as two completely different people. The problem with this argument is that in the game world it has been seven years since Sands. Anyone reading this can look back at their own lives from seven years ago and see differences between their behaviour before and now and they didn't have an invincible beast trying to kill them for all that time. If we also bear in mind the dilemma the prince faces in WW - NO hope, you WILL die, you CANNOT change your fate, it's all very negative and this all rubs off onto the character. He despises the fate he has been handed for a mistake he had no way of forseeing, he aggresively disregards the warnings of failure and is determined to free himself from this living nightmare. To be perfectly honest, the prince comes off as more of an anti-hero; a very selfish individual, willing to step over people he grows to care for (i.e. Kaileena) and takes no consideration of the consequence of his actions should he succeed in removing the Sands of Time from ever existing. It would be very easy to change the story so that the prince is a villain due to just how selfish his actions are, however, I personally like this anti-hero character. Rather than trying to ""save the day"" like a good generic hero always does, this hero is only interested in saving himself. It's a very interesting concept but, as mentioned before, can be very unappealing for fans who enjoyed the personality displayed in Sands.Moving over to the more positive elements, or at least the positives that haven't already been mentioned...Combat has been expanded from the previous game, allowing for the prince to make better use out of two weapons, or opting to use one weapon, as well as adding newer ways to interact with the surrounding areas and enemies during combat. The fighting system has lost it's smoother, more fluid movements from Sands but takes on a more aggressive and in-your-face approach, which is fitting for the mood of the game. I won't go too far into details but players willing to experiment and play around with the various attacks, counter-attacks, vaulting, running and jumping will have a lot of fun finding the various ways to slice their enemies in half or perform decapitations. Or at least I did.The story has some questionable points if you look closely enough, but, at it's heart, is coherent, consistent with its facts and, while some plot points are more than a little obvious, the overall journey is quite unpredictable and leaves the player questioning if the prince will actually succeed, that is until you realize that it makes for a pretty crappy ending if you ultimately fail your mission.Final Verdict: Warrior Within is a good game, fans of it's predecessor should at least consider trying it out but bear in mind that the two have very differnt personalities. If you don't like dark, gritty and violent then this is NOT the game for you. I personally enjoy this game a lot and because of its age it doesn't require a high spec computer to run (I'm using an HP laptop straight off the shelf and the game runs nice and smoothly)4 stars out of 5 from me. Great game but still does enough wrong to lose out on a flawless victory.			"

												Much like its predecessor, this game has aged remarkably well.  It started off rather slow, but once I became familiar with the combat system I found it hard to tear myself away from the computer.  The combat system is a major improvement over the original and places a great deal of freedom at your fingertips.  Moreover, it fosters a blend of action and exploration to keep you interested and to keep the game fast-paced.  When the game is at its best, you'll find yourself catapulting from acrobatic duels into high-adrenaline chase sequences through beautiful Gothic-style ruins.  I recommend it, especially for the price.There is one caveat worth mentioning.  This game is a significant departure from the original, especially with regard to its ambiance and storyline.  Warrior Within tries too hard to be dark and edgy, often to the point of ridiculousness.  That's a minor critique though, and if you can look past the stylistic flaws, I think you'll find that this game has aged gracefully and serves as a worthy successor to The Sands of Time.   "

												By far the best game ever.  İt is more than a game. I played and completed this game more than 11-12 and I still want to play it.  Actually if you know this game , you already think it is perfect.   Environment is awsome. Perfect atmosphere. Story 10/10 Characters 10/10 Environment 10/10 * ( more than 10  :D )   Gameplay  9.9/10  Musics and Sounds  10/10   ( maybe more than 10 if it is possible ) General   10/10   the best game ever so buy it and play.

												Игра на 5+! Она уникальна!:Первое - сюжет,..Второе - музыка (ну то есть саунд :) )))Третье - секреты - хрен найдете сами, либо найдете, но случайно - ибо раз на раз не приходится...Четвертое - акробатика, отличные комбо-приемы, одним словом - бой на высоте...Пятое - две концовки, и меня порадовало то, что не обязательно проходить игру несколько раз, чтобы обозреть обе, достаточно быть просто внимательным... (вру на пиратке я прошел эту игру 7 раз и тогда мне открылись не все тайны)))Короче, игра сильна, сильна тем, что вы в неё играете и интересно Вам, а не интересно кому-то, как счас стали делать...Ну я вообщем рекомендую олдскуллу, которая в танке)))))))))			"

												By far the best hack n slash game i've ever played.The gameplay may not be the best out there but the story is just a masterpiece. If you have played other prince of persia titles, bear in mind that unlike the other which have a 'high fantasy' theme in warrior within it's more of 'dark fantasy'. For me it made the landscapes/style a lot cooler ^^			"

												Warrior Within is one of my favorite games. Yes, this game is much darker and bloodier than the SoT and TT, but come on, prince tries to save himself from the time guardian Dahaka, and since the environment is dark and filled with dangerous monsters, prince has to adapt to it, in order to survive. And the soundtrack written by the Godsmack makes everything to fill your journey with the right mood.			"

												I know few people who hate this game but for me I enjoyed the hell out of it. There are some lame moments but the game is worth it. The plot is awesome but weird.If you don't care about outdated graphics (Like me) then this game is for you!			"

												I just replayed this game (November 2016) and I find it awesome, just like the first time I played it in my PS2 a decade ago. I love PoP games, the Sands of Time trilogy is fantastic, and this game, Warrior Within, is in my opinion the best of all PoP games!			"
