												F.E.A.R 3 is the last game in the F.E.A.R  series thus far, releasing in mid 2011 on PC, Xbox360 and PS3 being developed by Day 1 Studios, the same guys which developed the first F.E.A.R on PS3 and Xbox360. The bulk of the gameplay is the same as the previous titles with a few minor changes.  The main one being a change to how the cover system work. In the previous games you used to be able to tilt your character’s head around corners in order to shoot, F.E.A.R 3 adds a peeking system, where you can hug up against any sort of cover and drop your headup and down whilst also moving side to side in order to shoot from cover. This for me felt a lot easier to handle than the previous version and is a really nice change.  The rest of the game play is very much the same, I was a little bit let down by the gun mechanics however, I praised the first game heavily due to how the gun play feels so fluid and responsive, sadly in 3 I had a lot of trouble aiming whilst looking down the sight and spent the majority of the time shooting from the hip. This was mainly because the hit detection on the bullets is quite a bit off, you can sometimes get a direct hit on an enemies head and nothing happens.  There is only one new weapon to be introduced in the game too, a freezing gun which you obtain by overcoming one of the many fights with the same boss throughout the single player campaign mode. Graphically, F.E.A.R 3 looks OK. It is 4 years old at this point and you can tell it is part of the last generation of gaming, but it still holds it’s own compared to games released around that time. The texture quality is just bog standard OK again, where the F.E.A.R series does well, is the animation of the characters, they all have a very good ragdoll effect to them, meaning death animations are all on point and can result in some unique positions. F.E.A.R 3 isn’t hard when playing on the medium settings; FPS vetrans need to bump it up to hard mode for it to be even slightly challenging; I don’t think I died more than two times throughout the whole game which is something to be said given the amount of bosses you have to fight.  Some levels are actually made significantly easier since they give you a mech suit to use which whilst it is absolutely satisfying to blow up enemies at point blank range with missiles, it does make the level seem somewhat pointless as there is no challenge and just feels more like a time block than anything else. Unlike the previous games; the levels in F.E.A.R 3 are very linear and leave very little for the player to explore and find secrets/collectables. There is one collectable on each level which is randomly placed every time you play, but there isn’t extra bits of lore/plot to be found from hacking computers, or finding documents;  something which I did miss as the story in this game is actually somewhat interesting compared to the last games. A single play through this game took me just under four hours; where you will get the majority of your replay ability from F.E.A.R 3 is the co-op mode and challenge system. This is the first F.E.A.R game to have any sort of co-op mode in and it does it very well. The multiplayer missions feel very much like Killing Floor, so if you enjoyed that, you will get some enjoyment out of the F.E.A.R 3 multiplayer too. I only had one technical issue whilst playing, and that was when playing with more than on screen, your mouse will sometimes exit the screen you are playing on and when you click to shoot, you’ll minimize to your desktop as it has roamed onto another screen – this became a real annoyance on the latter levels when you have very little time to react to things. I was unable to find a fix for this online so be warned! To sum up, F.E.A.R 3 is definitely not as good as the previous two games, but it does offer something a bit different. The price on Steam of £12,99 is a bit steep given the shortness of the single player, but you can pick up the entire F.E.A.R collection from Bundle Stars for a mere £3.26 - https://www.bundlestars.com/en/bundle/fear-bundle  meaning you can’t really go wrong with picking the title up there.  Going off that, I am only going to recommend F.E.A.R 3 when it is on sale.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												FEAR 3 represents what is wrong with many 'modernization' processes of games. It takes everything that people liked about the first few games in the series and just replaces or modifies them to work with current trends, such as in this case regenerating health, co-op, perks... However, I would also argue FEAR 3 is not a bad game. If you're looking for a game akin to FEAR 1 or 2, this unfortunately is not it. It also is pretty lacking in the horror department. It's not scary, or even really atmospheric, though it attempts to be. What it is though, is a pretty fun multiplayer experience.The story will probably♥♥♥♥♥♥off long-time fans. Without going too deep into spoilers, the story basically focuses mostly on Fettel, the antagonist from the first game. The story's already kind of in a mess from the get-go, as we have things from psychic powers, clones, the fact our two main characters are the sons of the series main antagonist Alma, and just other plot elements that just scream they're so bad. But it's not badly written to be fair, and if you kind of turn off your brain it's kind of stupid entertainment. But you really shouldn't be playing this game for the story.The campaign should last for about 5-7 hours, with some highs and lows, but that in no way compares to the previous two games. The co-op helps make it a bit more fun, for better or worse. The two brothers play completely differently though, with Pointman basically being your typical action hero with the guns and the slide-kicks, and Fettel being actually surprisingly rather fresh, being a psychic man who can levitate enemies, possess them, shoot energy blasts, and more. Honestly, both are pretty fun, but I have to hand it to Fettel as for a game with very little inspiration behind it, his gameplay is actually rather original for this sort of game and fun.But it's not the campaign you should be buying FEAR 3 for, as weird as that might sound. I find most people never delve into the multiplayer modes in this game. And it's sensible, as the campaign is disappointing and usually multiplayer modes are tagged on without much thought or effort, so it's probably nothing special, right?Well, that's wrong, as it turns out the multiplayer modes in this game are actually the best part of the game.I can't even count how many friends who got FEAR 3 that ended up loving the multiplayer modes and hating the campaign. Let me explain; The campaign lacks tension, and often is a bit repetitive, on-top of the fact it just feels rather uninspired most of the time, its horror elements fail, and its action sequences aren't particularly great. But something FEAR 3 does surprisingly well is understand the fun elements of multiplayer shooters. Hell, some of the multiplayer modes are even far more tense and more horror-like than anything in the campaign.Multiplayer is split into four modes, and all four are pretty fun for up to four-players either locally or online. Each mode has different maps. One mode has you all as ghost phantoms who possess bodies and try to kill other enemies and your friends to collect souls, most souls at the end of a wave wins the round, and at the end of all waves, person with the most rounds won wins. Another mode has you in an open arena with multiple areas to station yourself in as you and friends fight hordes of enemies that come in waves, boarding up windows and between waves going out to collect supplies. It's a sort of rip-off of Zombie mode from CoD, but it has some interesting twists, such as Alma, who you should not look at as she'll cause randomized effects against you, ranging from just downing you to making you see your friends as enemies, making the screen go black, or teleporting you to another random point on the map. Or a fog, that gets thicker and thicker as the waves go on, and an unseen red-light monster lurks in the deeper parts of the fog... And in yet another mode, you and up to three friends run away from a giant wall of death. Really challenging, frantic, tense, panic-worthy, but a lot of fun as a lot of enemies get tossed your way and you only get small breathers to quickly recollect supplies before the wall is out it again. A race from death and survival that is both primal but also strategic and fun.The game also looks pretty good, and the PC port is well-done. Music works, but nothing outside of the credits song sticks as being particularly memorable.FEAR 3 is against most everything the FEAR series stands for, but if you can look over that and a disappointing campaign, I guarantee you there's some multiplayer fun here that may be worth experiencing.

												I have to agree with some of the other reviews I've read here since playing the game. The FEAR series started off as a game that was truly it's own genre; paranormal FPS. It stood proudly amongst it's predecessors like DOOM and Castle Wolfenstien.  The scare element was in the fact that you had all the firepower in the world, but it amounted to nothing to what was truly terrfying; a psychic ghost that is Alma, who seems hellbent on either scaring you to death, or burning you, whichever comes first. The first game really playing into lighting, textures and sound; right at the cusp of when the gaming world was really experimenting and playing with those elements. The enviroment was great, the gameplay was pretty smooth for its time. The combat was fun (slow-mo done right), the story was intriguing with just the right touch of spooky mystery, and the scare moments were downright terrifying. Had more than a few moments where I had to save and quit simply because my overly beating heart couldn't take anymore. Overall a very solid horror game that was quite a few years ahead of it's time. 9/10FEAR 2 brought in more of a balance between the combat and the scare moments. The combat was much much smoother compared to FEAR, and the graphics were amazing compared to other games of it's time. You still played a silent protaginist, which was odd considering that you don't officially play as Pointman, but overall the story was very tight and the scare moments were still pretty scary and fairly unpredictable. Overall an improvement in some subtle ways, but there were a few moments where it seemed a little TOO combat heavy. A for effort though, and I have to say I enjoyed playing it across the board. 7/10And then FEAR 3...changed developers, which can be either really good or really bad for a game mid/end series, and right during the COD craze being at it's peak. And by God did it show. Restricted to 2 weapons, majority of the weapons vanilla and mediocre. Over half the special weapons gone, and the really fun ones (Nail gun and laser gun I'm looking at you two) were only given sparcely during the end and really had next to no screen time. The scare moments were also next to non-existent, despite a few gems of those moments being hidden here and there, and the combat was so heavy and pointless it felt like I was playing more of a crappy, cheap horror rendition of a Call of Duty game than a horror FPS. And since a lot of the expansions from the first two games was rendered non-canon, the story had a ton of plot holes and the ending was just crap with it being so open ended. I was vastly disappointed with how a wonderful game series that I had grown to love had crashed and burned so horribly. If you're looking to simply finish the story, if you can even call it that it's so bad, from the previous games that is virtually the only semi-good reason to buy this game. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it at all. 2-3/10			"

												Well, well, well. Another shooter has fallen to the subscriptions of substandard Call-of-Duty-esque gaming.F.E.A.R. 3 is a game in which you (assuming you play as Point Man, the long-time protagonist of the series.) and your dead, cannibal brother, whom you killed, team up to... Uhmmm. Do something? It involves Alma's baby. That's all that's really made apparent.Firstly, the ""dramatic story-line"" they boast about on the store page has little relation to the actual game. The story-line was little more than a rail for you to follow from shooty-segment to shooty-segment. In fact, since Point Man is completely mute, they never really elaborate on why exactly he wants Alma's baby. Maybe it's to shoot it? But that contradicts the ending... I dunno.Secondly, the game is named FEAR. Shouldn't actual fear be it's main and central focus? Well, it's not. In fact, the FEAR franchise has gotten less and less scary as time's gone on. Sure, there'll be the creepy black figure running across a gate every once in a while, but it all falls flat when you perform a psychic link on a random corpse for ""Rank Points"" and it gets plastered all over your screen in the middle of the supposed horror that you ""HAVE RANKED UP TO LEVEL __""Lastly, however, the co-op is fun. Not exactly difficult, even in the hardest difficulty, a friend of mine was able to pick the game up and immediately demolish everything. But nonetheless, it was fun. However, it continues to take away from the percieved horror of the game. No matter what game it is, cooperative horror doesn't work. When you have a friend singing ""Fireball"" on the mic, any horror in the scene tends to be lost.So, if you played the original F.E.A.R. and are looking for a second dose of the thrilling horror that was in the first game, go buy the original Dead Space. If you're looking for a great story plot with lots of depth and heart-wrenching moments, then go buy The Walking Dead Seasons 1 & 2. If you're looking for a mediocre cooperative experience to share with your friends for about 5 hours of game-time, however, then you've come to the right place.TL;DR: Not scary, not deep in story, not good single player, not difficult, but a nice little 5 hour time-sink for you and a friend.I do not recommend this game,»ZCC« Zombie Chicken			"

												The first F.E.A.R. was an outstanding masterpiece. The two following expansion packs were so so.F.E.A.R. 2 was great in my opinion. The game had a crappy story although the pacing of the game was good, it also featured a smart AI, it had amazing visuals (fire effect, smoke, explosion, close combat, firefights, etc), some great scares and a convincing atmosphere, etc.F.E.A.R 3 features an even smarter AI. The enemy soldiers are quick to take cover, switch positions, retreat, suppress you, throw grenades, flank you and charge you when they can. There's also plenty of enemy chatter that you can hear which allows you to anticipate some of your enemies' movements. They will also call you out if you are hiding for too long.Needless to say, the AI as advanced as it is in Killzone 2,3 which features the smartest FPS AI to date. In fact, the AI is sometimes so smart, it becomes punishing. Plus there's no blind fire option, you make peek out of your cover and unleash small burst but you will almost certainly get return fire. Your screen WILL stay red for an extended period of time after being shot at. You may also chose to stay in cover until the red screen goes away, but sometimes you can get approached by a guy with a shotgun who will blow you away.Your flashlight will also expose you to your enemies just like in the first game. However, I tested this further and found out that the enemies will react to your flashlight even IF they do not face you, meaning they react to your flashlight being turned on, they don't react to the flashlight necessarily because the AI field of vision picks it up.The cover system is outstanding and I can only wish that most if not all FPS featured this kind of cover system. The Killzone franchise invented this realistic cover system first though.When you take cover, you do not get the chance to view yourself in the third person perspective nor will you be able to magically see everything that is going on around you. This time, the only way for you to view your surroundings is to peek from a cover. It is too bad there's no leaning option, but you can lean easily when in cover.The bullet time is back and it works the same way it did in F.E.A.R 2, although it drains slightly faster, at first at least.Oh and also, Paxton Fettel is back! Damn did I miss his voice. ""They all deserve to die..."" Although, if you want to play single player, you can only play as Point Man. Your co-op buddy therefore can play as Fettel. This time around, Alma won't shred your enemies as often. You'll have to rely on Fettel more to do the job. Although you yourself have some psychotelepathic skills. Fettel's abilities are slightly overpowered but he makes for an awesome anti-hero.However, F.E.A.R has always been a franchise about the single-player experience. The co-op campaign might be slightly unfounded here. Fettel's occasional remarks do not ruin the immersion of the game, but they do ruin the time when you immerse yourself enough to believe that you are the only one fighting the enemy - all by yourself. He is always there somehow, watching your every step, so you never really feel alone. Ultimately, the co-op is a great add-on, I'm just not sure if the F.E.A.R. franchise really needed it. There are some games out there that scream co-op but don't have any, such as Clive Barker's Jericho for instance.There's also a horde mode, reminiscent of the Call of Duty Zombie mode. You still build barricades and get better weapons but this time you are fighting the smart AI that is assaulting your position instead of shooting brain dead zombies.In general, the game play is extremely rewarding. The guns feel real, although shotgun looks quite idiotic.The firefights are realistic enough: the recoil, the smoking barrel,the destructible environments, the matrix-looking like bullet movement in slow mo, the human-like AI - it's all there. You can also slide over cover just like in Brink.In general, the controls are pretty fluid except for when you push the button to take cover and then if you need to desperately displace, you will need to push the button again to exit cover and sometimes that will get you killed, unless you keep pushing ""S"" but forget about exiting cover any other way but by pressing the cover button. Switching cover is also very fluid - something that Killzone did not introduce.Another huge positive note is that you can actually see your legs! how awesome is that? You don't get to see that too often. However, you do not cast a shadow all the time, just in some places. Also, one of the most satisfying things in F.E.A.R. is throwing a grenade at a couple of guys, shooting a couple of guys in slo-mo and finally kicking the last standing guy in the face therefore destroying the entire squad in seconds.The graphics are satisfying to say the least, there's also Directx11 (IGN's gripe about the supposedly outdated graphics while reviewing the game on PS3 is therefore unwarranted; the AI issue is also redundant because the AI is insanely smart). The story is enough to keep you playing although the cheap Alma scare tactics can give you slight jumps even though some of them are cliche and predictable. The atmosphere is solid, there are some major set pieces.On the negative side, those mech robots are back and man do I hate those stages. I prefer a great tactical FPS as opposed to silly arcade mech warrior shoot-ups. I'm disappointed they brought these mechs stages over from F.E.A.R. 2. because these frustrating levels are unnecessary.The game gives you plenty of opportunity to sneak on enemies and take out one or two before others react, but the game does not give you the opportunity to silently kill the two and have the ability to shoot the rest in a quick fashion.Also, the melee kills should be worked out. It feels sluggish and consolish because the melee kills are auto aimed for you. Sometimes you get to kill your enemies instantly with a knife if the knife slices their head. Sometimes, you have to slash them several times for them to die, not only that, they often have the balls to fight back as you keep slashing their face.Ultimately there's not that many negatives, as far as the solid gameplay is concerned anyway, F.E.A.R. 3 is a solid shooter.

												Fear 3 is the weakest link of the Fear series and it doesn't feel like a true FEAR game. It changes so many things that didn't need any changes and introduced some new things to the franchise that are not compatible with a horror shooter. But the worst thing about this game is that it is a console port with console game mechanics.+ Graphics are nice+ Sound is good+ Some characters of the franchise are in the game+ Co-op campaign- Weapon variety is reduced. Also, after every mission you lose your weapons again, which isn't that immersive.- The plotline is a mess.- Linear and small console maps. Even objects that are not high can't always be jumped over.. - Health regeneration was introduced. This doesn't fit into a horror game.- This game is such a horror game that you can earn skills and even pick up Alma dolls. :P- The final chapter is anti-climaticFear 3 is an average fps, but a bad Fear game. I can't recommend buying this game except if you are a die-hard FEAR fan and want to play this game despite its faults.Replay value: Only with a friend or if you want to play as FettelRating: 6.5/10Recommendation: No for a Fear game, neutral for a fps			"

 If you like shooters it's okay. If you like F.E.A.R. it's bad. This game should have never been called fear. I say this not just for the spurious representation of the classic fear games, but for the fact the game is not scary. The original fear is in my option a revolutionary game, the level of detail and thought put into it was tremendous. This game however has little to none to connect this to the original fear.   The Replicants are gone. The invisible assassins are gone. This does not seem to be a fear game, and that is a good way to put it as this game seems more like another. Call of duty clone is not a term that should be used likely but the similarities are far too obvious, nearly all of the original mechanics of fear(health/armor, specialized weapons) have been torn out to put in call of duty mechanics(health regeneration, riot shield, flash grenades.).The first level says it all for me. I start crawling through the jail not sure what going to happen when I realized. It's too bright. The first “scare” was little more than an special effect and Alma saying hello. Next a power failure, finally some scary scenes. However before one jump scare the lights come back on. Finally, I as the middle of a firefight when I see an enemy above me on a catwalk. My thoughts went as follows. “Crud, im going to have to walk around to get at him.. wait, this a fear game, there quality games, I should be able to shoot through the floor!” this is when I realized this is no fear game.   And it really isn’t a fear game. Like the other fear games, it was not made on the LithTech engine. This engine gave fear so much more than other games. I already notice several missing refinements. The levels where sloppy. In the first you knew what way to go. It gave you plenty of lighting hints movements and other cues to push you in the right direction. I got lost many times in this one.  Lastly the story, to be honest, If you did not play Fear 2 you would not care about 70% of this story. Truthfully If point man where to just walk away the same ending would have happened.  There are many issues with the story that I could argue but I think the main issue I had was Alma. All the way through the fear games Alma has been set as a boogeyman. And even though a new creep one was created for this she is still this silent super being, beging in the shadows in the first game was okay. This was the story of the story, but now that we have reached the end her character barely develops from being a bump in the night.			"

												Remember F.E.A.R. when it first came out and you wanted to play it even though your system couldn't even handle it?  Perhaps, that was not the case for you, but it was for me.  Eventually, I was able to run it with decent hardware and I never looked back.F.E.A.R. stepped into the seen in slow-mo and then it took the first-person shooter genre by storm, tailored to shooter and survival-horror fans.  F.E.A.R. 3, while the weaker follow-up to the F.E.A.R. series still holds up as an atmospheric game with solid gunplay and an interestingly shocking ending like its predecessor.  Some may complain that the formula is becoming boring and stale, but it is still a perfectly decent addition to the franchise.As a fan of the Dead Space series, I found F.E.A.R. 3 to have a commanding presence when it comes to atmosphere.  I would argue that F.E.A.R. 3 nails the atmosphere and overall eerie-filled environments better than Dead Space 3. The attentional to detail is more adequate in some areas than others, but it has enough going in that department to earn a ribbon.  The gunplay is rock-solid, which makes gameplay worthwhile.  Along with the cover system that lets you peek while in cover, quickly lean to the opposite side and aim, it nails the cover-system just right.  For those that are looking for a more conventional F.E.A.R. 3 tactic and approach to gameplay, it is still all there and nothing much has changed if you want to use slow-mo and the run-and-gun variety.  Even on the easiest difficulty, F.E.A.R. 3 can present some difficulty spikes.  A franchise that basically expects a player to run-and-gun using the slow-mo function, you could be taken down quickly on normal difficulty.  It asks you to be tactical while using slow-mo.  It is slightly different from F.E.A.R. 1 in that you are not only running into singular rooms, using slow-mo, and unloading.  There are plenty of cover usage so you will need to run from one cover to another while using slow-mo.  Think of it as a Chinese action film with lots of gun-fighting.  It can be quite satisifying at times, but the variation comes in with using cover to get to where you need to go without dying outright.  I hear it is a common complaint among the series' fans, but I did not find a major issue with it.F.E.A.R. 3 is far from great and it is worth noting that it is not spectacular as the original F.E.A.R.  Either way, it manages to be a perfectly decent addition to the series without presenting any major quams.  It is successful at being a solid first-person shooter with the well-known F.E.A.R. elements.  While I cannot comment on the co-operative play because I have no experience in it, F.E.A.R. 3 offers enough there to warrant a purchase on a decent sale.  I paid $5 for it and I thought that it was worth it.  I cannot say for sure if it would have been worth $10 though.  It's a rock-solid game to the series.  Just do not expect another F.E.A.R. 1 and you will enjoy it for what it offers.  Game on,ElannRating: 7 out of 10			"

												The history of F.E.A.R's development has swapped hands through practically every expansion and installment and which each one, a new take on the franchise was created. Most, if nearly all, fans of the series consider the first F.E.A.R to be the 'best' due to its thick, tense atmosphere and and engaging combat and I agree to a point. F.E.A.R 1 still out plays most shooters and horror games today! So with that legacy and high standard already set from the get go, it'd cetainly be a challenge to meet it again, especially in the hands of a different developer! As a result, many people tend to look down on F.E.A.R 3 as being a 'generic' CoD clone and this couldn't be more of a lie!F.E.A.R 3 is certainly different to its predecessor in terms of pace, atmosphere and horror. It's not what I'd call a horror game and that may be a turn off for most. But what it lacks in creepy it certainly MORE than makes up for in fun and replayability! The standard of combat is very much maintained despite the (shock horror) regenerating health and cover systems. The guns have a very engaging feel to them, enemies being gibbed and pinned to the wall or heads popping to the lined up headshot let you know you're in a F.E.A.R game! Regenerating health seems more fitting to the title as the levels are not as big and large scale combat happens a lot more frequently, not giving you time to look for those hidden health boosts in previous games. Cover system can be taken or left, it's simply another option of play style which leads to another staple feature of F.E.A.R 3. Pointman? Fettel? or both? You can now play as the big bad lil' brother in F.E.A.R, who comes with his own unique playstyle of possessing enemies and harassing them with supernatural powers. This can lead to great gameplay choices like choosing who to possess based on position, type of enemy or weapon they're carrying. Pointman's slow mo reflexes and neo martial arts return also adding more choices to how you take out your enemies. While either character is a blast to play with, the real fun and where the game truly shines comes when both monsters are on the field together in the form of co-op. The whole game can be played together where the two brothers tackle the campaign in a ironically funny way. Pointman can slow down time to help Fettel with his possessions or Fettel can quickly take out a strong enemy harassing pointman by either suspending him in midway for Pointman to finish or for Fettel to possess! There's a rewarding and competitive points system in each playthrough to decide who ultimately is the favourite son! Some actions can be performed where you greedily obtain all the points of a situation or share them with your brother depending on the bond with your 'brother' (after all this a game about the strength of 'family' :P) Seeing Alma subtely appear through out levels is a nice nod to her freaky apperances in previous F.E.A.R games and it was always a cool thing to find! Some level designs and moments can lead to an eerie feeling, but nothing you'd expect from 1, still it's nice to have it there, it doesn't feel like some tacked on thing to a shooter. Multiplayer is surprisingly engaging, with fun unique game modes like 'JUST F**KING RUN' where you and your team are being chased by a fog of screaming death and your goal is to just keep running towards the goal while taking out enemy obstacles in your path! Though you can't get held up for too long and the fog is ever approaching! Contractions revolves around your team mates stock piling crates found in the map that provide you with weapons and ammo. You repair barricades to doors and windows and together you must hold out against waves of ever strengthening opponents! But be careful! As Alma stalks the rooms and streets and if she catches you staring at her, you're in for a terrible time...All in all I was so pleasantly surprised to know that the F,E,A,R legacy (despite the popular cries) was kept in tact whie Day One Studios added their own interpretation to the series and it worked! F.E.A.R 3 is a more than solid shooter that, for me, is still fun and replayable after already 6 playthroughs. The game is short enough for one playthrough with a buddy, take a lll 10 minute break then go straight back, swapping roles and doing it again which is exactly what me and my girlfriend did! It keeps the campaign lean and eventful, nothing tacked on to try and trick you that your getting you money's worth simply because it was so and so many hours long. The game is fun by itself but ultimately, F.E.A.R 3 is best played with a 'brother'. Whether your experience will be about brotherly love or sibling rivalry will depend on you!			"

												First problem is that they changed developers, Monolith did not create this game because Day 1 Studios did. So if you are wondering why it doesn't feel like a F.E.A.R. game then that might have something to do with it. Second problem is that the atmosphere did not have the same feeling at all compared to the first and second F.E.A.R. titles. It's as if they changed it from a vengeful spirit sort of thing to people being possessed by demons.Third problem is why is the mysterious ""point man"" and Fettel being haunted by the spirit of their father? I didn't get the impression from the first game that Harlan would have had such an impact on them out of nowhere. The gameplay was alright for a shooter but seemed horrible for a FEAR title. The cover mechanic was cool but the weapons are practically garbage on what they were like in the previous two titles. They removed the HP bar and the Armor bar, they took the ridiculous Battlefield & Call of Duty route with the HP. HP is much lower than it used to be and it regenerates itself, not a good thing to change in my opinion. Armacam looks different again. Overall it is fun to play if you didn't care for the main games or if you can overlook the fact they changed developers. If you really enjoyed FEAR for what it was for the first and second installments then you might be disappointed. I am certainly upset that they went from Monolith to Day 1 Studios.			"

												Yes, it's true, this game doesn't start new plotlines, it doesn't present new characters and there's no radical change in gameplay if compared to the previous games of the series. And it's great because this game, in fact, is an epilogue and as an epilogue it does an amazing job tying up loose ends and resolving all the matters. This final instalment to the franchise is the perfect conclusion of the outstanding horror story, thrilling and dramatic denouement of the confrontation between the brothers. Definitely worth getting, at least for the priceless opportunity to play as Paxton Fettel.			"

												I don't see why all the hatred for this game. Sure, it seems like a generic shooter, sure, it's not as good as the past games, sure, it's not scary at all (Hell, not even the ""scary"" parts were remotely close to being scary to me), but still, I enjoyed this game.It's pretty much mindless, dumb fun, not supposed to be taken seriously (Which I know that past games were supposed to be like that), and co-op isn't that bad, to be fair. Of course, playing this game on Co-op makes this game anything BUT scary. Mostly because you can't split up. Co-op horror games are creepy when you are forced to split up. This game doesn't make you do that, hell, you can't even move far away from your partner because (If you are playing as Fettel) you will be immediatly teleported to your nearest Pointman. Combat can get a bit monotonous at times, fight soldiers here, destroy mechs over there, slay a few anarchy zombies, and use a giant robot yourself! With an exploit, it seems. If you are about to die and you leave the mech and get back inside as quickly as you can, your health will be fully restored. That made the bridge level MUCH easier. I dunno if mechs count, I dunno if the phase guys in giant suits count, hell, I dunno if the power generator you gotta shot count as bosses. For me, there was only one boss, the final boss. Which....Can be killed in a couple of minutes, which in turn is a huge dissapointment. BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER, DANZIG AT THE END CREDITS! Of course, the game is pretty damn short, I finished it in less than 4 hours, which is kind of a dissapointment. That's my only complaint about this game. If you are a die hard fan of the series, I wouldn't really recommend this. If you are just a fan of the series, sure, go ahead. If you are a lover of mindless shooters that can be plain and perhaps a bit repetitive at times, it's a must buy!			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 is an average, and unremarkable, horror first person shooter.  If you have ever played a fps then you'll be familiar will everything that F.E.A.R. 3 has to offer, if you have never played a fps before... well that kind of odd and remarkable, and you probably shouldn't have your first fps experience with F.E.A.R. 3. This isn't to suggest that F.E.A.R. 3 is a bad game, but more to the fact that the game lacks polish. It has some nice things going for it, the campaign gameplay varies enough to stay fresh, there is co-op (which I didn't get to experience since none of my friends have this game), and the two playable characters feel slightly different from each other. However, the game has significant things going against it. For starters, it isn't scary, which is a problem, considering that it is a horror fps. Second, the campaign itself drags on for way too long and often feels like it is stretching things out, just to fully use an environment (a la, if we spent months making a haunted department store, then the player is going to see every freaking room in it). And lastly, the game's story is very narrow and straight to the point, so if you haven't played the previous games in the series, you'll not going to understand everything that is going on, and even if you did, you're still not going to understand everything.If you play this game under ideal conditions (co-op with a good friend that scares easily) then I would image that this game would be great, however, that isn't going to happen for the vast majority of people, so this game is not worth it.

(I like it).-Will catch you up on the story if you havn't played the first 2 installments (Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate excluded).Negative:-The graphics seem a backward step from F.E.A.R 2.-The story is contradictory and dissapointing. -It tries to be scary and falls short unlike previous installments.-Much easier than past 2 installments by taking on a generic health system (I'M LOOKING AT YOU COD), you recover health instead of trying to scavenge it and armour.-I don't know who thought it would be a good idea to introduce a point based challenge system in order to 'level up'.-'A lot' of reiteration of previous F.E.A.R story points.-Do not understand the Replicas' 'deal' this game.-Alma?

Although this game isn't much long, it's really enjoyable to play. Find a friend to play with and ffight the fear together! If you have more than 1 friend who wants to play, there are 4 players coop missions, which are also interesting and reminded me kinda Killing floor.

												F.E.A.R. 1 was an eery, brilliant experience that basically brought horror movies like ""The Ring"" to life (kind of) and mixed it with a good shooter.F.E.A.R. 2 kinda fumbled the atmosphere of the first part (which was made great to begin with by short bursts of violence and shock and then left alone completely) but replaced it with some of the best jump scares and intimidating level design I've ever seen. Plus, it was a good shooter with some neat additions.F.E.A.R. 3 fails at both. It's not scary. It's not eery. It's a mediocre shooter that forces a mediocre coop-system down everybody's throat who wanted to play the game for its own sake, for the story, for whatever. The story's conclusion is uninspired and it doesn't even take you too long to get there. Play the first two games and then forget part 3 exists.			"

												If you have any experience at all with the first two  games and DLC, this is not the game for you. An atmospheric series with great graphics, decent AI, solid combat, and an actual plot (!) has been made into something a great deal more generic with weak story and no horror.Being biased towards co-op play, repetitive areas, and NPCs constantly reacting to you with horror even when you have done nothing but hide behind cover for a few minutes were enough to drive me from a series I have played and replayed for years. Hearing a surviving soldier screaming ""did you SEE that?!"" every thirty seconds made me sad for a series that was able to creep me out and scare me with more than just the occassional startle. Do yourself a favor and play (or replay as the case may be) the first two games, as they continue to hold up - much better than this cynical cash grab.			"

Also the graphics have no customization options and it looks really blurry.Full video review:

												I consider this the worst FEAR game in the series... the story is not engaging, it is not scary, and the gameplay is not innovative, it is just a ""Go from point A to point B"" shooter.If you are playing Co-op, then it might be interesting because one player will be playing with very different mechanics, which end up getting repetitive and boring after some time.

												As a major fan of the F.E.A.R. Franchise and playing all the games, it hurts me to say that this game is likely the worst of the entire franchise. WB games made a LOT of bad choices with this one. The thing that made F.E.A.R. and its expansion packs scary was sometimes, you don't know if what you are experiencing is a hallucination or the real thing until the end. ""Was that person who walked down that corridor real?"" You would ask yourself, you would then go down that hallway to help that person to just find a bloodfilled deadend with a healthpack, you would then turn around to see that person you saw stand right in front of you, horribly mutilated before fading into ashes.F.E.A.R. 2 Was scary but not in the same way as the first, almost everything paranormal or scary you saw was real, not a hallucination which kind of kills the mood. You can tell F.E.A.R. 2 was more focused on combat and some levels were even more Linear than F.E.A.R. F.E.A.R. at least let you explore for health boosters or reflex boosters, or even different guns. F.E.A.R. 2 however only rewarded you with reflex boosters or intel laying out in the open.This release, F.E.A.R. 3 had a lot of incoming hype but was ultimately, WB games' futile attempt to close the F.E.A.R. story. It seems that this one was focused entirely on combat though there is not a lot of variation to the enemies. The Co-op option doesnt make my opineon of the game better either, just a way for WB to continue jumping the shark. It may not even as well be CALLED Co-op as it seems to be a competitive shooter to see who can kill more bad guys, who can do more of their special maneuvers and who can ♥♥♥♥ eachother over more by stealing a psychic link behind your partner's back. This isnt the game for you if you want a shooter with occasional scares like the last 2 F.E.A.R.s, ultimately, major F.E.A.R. fans will be disappointed. If you wish to close the F.E.A.R story and dont give a crap about scares, go right ahead. On the other hand, if you want an experience that was in years of development and delivers a ton of scares, this one you can definently skip.			"

												So, so many things wrong with this game, but in short: they forgot to think while designing it, and threw out so many good, already working ideas through the windows.We got back Point Man, the mute hero from the first game, but in F3AR we have multiple awkward third-person cutscenes where people talk to him, and he just stares angrily like a neanderthal.The combat features ""evolutionary slow-mo modes"" that's apparently still revolutionary, 6 years, 2 games and 3 expansions later. Also the combat is strictly cover-based shooter with iron sights, auto-healing,  bad granade-throwing physics and bad AI, ocassionally a mech section. Also it has about 4 different types of enemy if we don't count the different weapons on them.*edit: and a sneak peek into AI: I crossed a corridor and got hidden behind the corner, and the enemy started having radio chatter about how did I vanished, impossible, and started to repeatedly look after me in a 2m*2m room without them realizing that I can not be there.The gameplay has close to no horror elements, just sh*tloads of gore because apparently blood paintings = horror. The game ignored the second game's story and Fettel is still just a spirit, despite him having a new body (so a gimmicky coop can work), and changed the storyline so Alma, who was multiple times stated went straight-out crazy (and murderous) around 6 YO, was actually a misunderstood child who never wanted to hurt anyone but ""her demons"" were drawing out the evil in her.  The whole game just... changed from dark and threatening and manipulative into teenage horror movie props and save the little girl themes... and also don't forget the levelup and xp system that makes so many xp popups on the screen during playing that it's severely distracting.Add the abysmal looking graphics to this - it looks like someone smeared vaseline over the screen, everything is blurry that's more than 4 metres far... I can't believe that Fear 1 and 2 looks so, so much better than this game.The only positive thing I could point out that's the coop campaign because it's really rare that it's present in games, but uninspired cookie-cutter covershooter with slapped on FEAR story and bad graphics doesn't make me want to relive the campaign ever again. It was well enough once.			"

												Even for an avid fan of the series, this was hard to get through.  The duck-and-cover nature of the engine is poorly suited to the type of game F.E.A.R. is and the execution was good, but it just didn't fit.  Shuffling game studios hurt the franchise more than helped it, and I would much rather play the first game over the second or third.  The story becomes a bit farfetched at this point--even by F.E.A.R. standards--and the map design made chokepoints predictable and the levels tedious to get through.  The alternate play style of Paxton Fettel didn't add much to the game, and definitely not enough to redeem it.			"

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.The first F.E.A.R. was an outstanding masterpiece. The two following expansion packs were so so.F.E.A.R 3 features an even smarter AI. The enemy soldiers are quick to take cover, switch positions, retreat, suppress you, throw grenades, flank you and charge you when they can. There's also plenty of enemy chatter that you can hear which allows you to anticipate some of your enemies' movements. They will also call you out if you are hiding for too long.There's also a horde mode, reminiscent of the Call of Duty Zombie mode. You still build barricades and get better weapons but this time you are fighting the smart AI that is assaulting your position instead of shooting brain dead zombies.Ultimately there are not that many negatives, as far as the solid gameplay is concerned.Overall: F.E.A.R. 3 is a solid shooter.

												What an atrocity...FEAR 1 and 2 were absolutely fantastic games that were unrivaled in the fusion of Horror and FPS, and still are, to this day. Eventually FEAR 3 came along to complete the trilogy. FEAR 1 had atmosphere, difficulty, great story and great gameplay. FEAR 2 had more of the same, but with a more streamlined approach to the story, but it didn't have as many open ended levels.FEAR 3 ditched the horror, the good writing and ended up adding COOP to follow the COOP craze. The game was not difficult, the horror elements were completely removed, and the story was so out of wack, incongruent and just horribly written. Both the first 2 FEAR games had incredible AI that provided difficulty. Here, they might as well just be standing still. The level design is horribly linear, with no options of going in a different way. Do yourselves a favor and stay away from this atrocity. If you were a fan of the first 2 games, this game will do nothing but sour your memory of the series. Avoid this like the plague!			"

												The single-player mode in this game is rubbish -- but that's alright. If you play through the campaign with a friend, much like Resident Evil 6 and Kane & Lynch, this becomes a much different and much better game. It's fun to react to what your friend is experiencing and go through the over-the-top, ridiculous story together. The gunplay is, much like F.E.A.R. 2, very solid and enjoyable.Similarly, the multiplayer is amazing with modes like ""♥♥♥♥ing Run"" that bring a fresh coat of paint to what would have otherwise been mediocre multiplayer. Unfortunately, nobody plays online anymore really. Buy it on a sale and share it with a friend. You won't regret it.			"

												This doesn't even deserve the title ""FEAR"".It's a series of shooting galleries loosely themed to the game. You enter an area, kill a few dozen enemies, then they unlock the door to the next area. This pattern repeats to the end of the game. There are no interesting places, no interesting gameplay - its literally just one big shooting gallery with COD-esque gameplay and a points and ranking system. The plot can basically be summed up as ""Fettel is resurrected and competes with Point Man for Alma's attention"", which in my personal opinion completely ruins both characters. Even Beckett, from the god-awful FEAR 2, was ruined by framing him as some sort of weakling who'd be an alcoholic if he weren't in such dire circumstances.Every single positive point to the series was removed in favor of this ridiculous shooting gallery gameplay. At least the AI is able to do something other than stand out in the open - sometimes.			"

Excuse me, is there scare?F.E.A.R. 3 suprises. Luckily, to a large extent it is a positive surprise, because the rivalry of two brothers equipped with supernatural abilities has brought to the gameplay freshness. Also the length of the campaign is not that big downside, because you want to return to it, not only to find all the secrets and improve the records, but most of all, to see how you can murder with the other character. Unfortunately, along with the freshness and efficiency, mood of horror has vanished somewhere. Alma is still able to jump out suddenly or bash the cabinet with her hand, but it does not go beyond the already ripped to the pain motives, at which we just shudder our arms out of habit.As a horror single player F.E.A.R. 3 falls pale. However, if you have at hand someone who is willing to spend a few evenings in the common butchery, then go ahead and buy it.			"

												I went into this game expecting nothing, since I heard it didn't hold up against FEAR 1.  Truth is it doesn't, but that didn't stop me from having a great time anyway!FEAR 3 is a pretty standard corridor shooter, at least if you play it as a single player game like I did.  The sound design is great, guns and explosions feels satifyingly punchy.  In one part of the campaign had your character go temporarily deaf due to an explosion for about 5 minutes, at first I thought it was a bug but it works great for the scene, very memorable.  The music is great as well, it really enhances some of the spooky bits.Some of the environments are downright inspired, level 2 where you're fighting cultists in a costco TV electronics section that looks like a hall of mirrors is a standout moment.  Making your way through crashed train cars on a collapsing bridge was another great scene.  The level where you're fighting your way through cultist martial law suburbia is like a dark take on Modern Warefare 2's levels in the same setting.  Whoever put the shower jumpscare in the game, congrats, that one got me good.The difficulty is definitely skewed for consoles, play on the hardest difficulty and it's fun.    Didn't run into any bugs on my playthrough, although a few sections were next to impossible to complete without abusing the AI.  The enemies are dumb cannon fodder in this game, nothing like FEAR 1.  Playthrough took maybe 7-8 hours.In short, it's a fairly standard shooter with some brilliant environments.  I'd give it a shot if you enjoy single player fps games and can get it for cheap.			"

												F.E.A.R 3 can be considered the worst game in the series and that's something i can agree.This game might be fun playing co-op with a friend but otherwise you will hate the new gameplay style (If you compare to the other games)The story can be good but it's totally ♥♥♥♥ed up in my opinion and i can agree that F.E.A.R 2 was 1000x times better than this.Anyways i hope we can have a another F.E.A.R game that is not bad as this one.

												F.E.A.R. 3 is nothing like the previous F.E.A.R. games: gone are the horror elements, med-kits, upgrade pick-ups, multiple paths to out flank enemies and intelligent AI. Instead, F.E.A.R. 3 has taken a page out of the popular Call of Duty games and gives the player regenerating health and points to level up their profile when completing challenges within the game. If you're a fan of the F.E.A.R. series it may be worth playing just to see where the confusing and spotty story ends up or if you're looking for a shooter this game has some potential but it's nothing like the previous games which are way superior to this one.

												This is a mixed bag, leaned more towards the negative side due to history. I recommend this game if you want a quick time killer with a friend or more, as this is a good generic shooter. As a F.E.A.R. game, it is nothing but disappointment all around, and it's not just because of the lack of scares like a lot of people say, it involves many other things. Single PlayerThe way the story is told is underwhelming, there is no more mystery and atmosphere, hardly any suspense, or anything to look out for in order to aid your knowledge on what is going on. They blatantly killed off almost every single character from the previous games, without any logic or explanation; they were either forgotten, or cut off from the story. Makes me surprised they even brought Jin Sun-Kwon back, but not characters like Holiday, Betters, Aristide, among many others. The gameplay is functional, don't get me wrong, but like almost everything in this, it no longer feels like F.E.A.R., the only essence left there is the slow-motion, certain melee attacks, and very few weapons.I'd say it's like Call of Duty with a cover system no one cares about. The amazing soundtrack the series contained simply disappeared here, and was replaced by a lackluster and utterly forgettable one. The only redeeming quality of a F.E.A.R. game this has in my opinion, is Paxton Fettel himself, who while looks different and has abilities that feel uninspired and limited, retained not only his voice actor, but also his character and cold behavior. Another complaint is that the game is extremely short, you can finish it in under 4 hours.MultiplayerThe multiplayer is nothing like the previous' games. It tends to be co-op focused, even though 2 of the 4 game modes are competitive (Soul King and Soul Survivor). Contractions' core mechanics remind me of Call of Duty's Zombies mode, which while not necessarily bad, lacks originality. Good game mode, regardless. In ♥♥♥♥ing Run the players have to push through waves of enemies while running from Alma's 'wall of death', a very interesting concept that works nicely. Soul King is the one truly competitive game mode, in which no player cooperates with each other at all, since the objective is to eliminate everyone in sight and collect the dropped souls. Soul Survivor is similar, but only one player is selected as a spectre at the beginning of a round, whose objective is to kill the other players and turn them into spectres before the time runs out. All game modes are solid and work well, but will get repetitive after a small amount of time due to the fact that there is only a small selection of maps. I was also turned off by the removal of game modes such as Deathmatch, Capture The Flag, Slow-Mo Team Death Match, and others.ConclusionThe verdict is split. The game for someone who doesn't care for the series is likely to be solid, because the gameplay can be fun if you play it with friends and mess around in the multiplayer. However, as a huge fan of the series I say avoid it at all costs, unless you love Fettel like a fangirl. As a game alone it gets a 6.8/10.0. As a F.E.A.R. game, 1.6/10.0. "

I have seen a lot of people who hate the game for not being ""as good"" as the previous installments, I had a great time with it. Then again, I played F.E.A.R 3 before I played the previous installments, so these are just my impression of the game as a game and not as a sequel. And since I played the games out of order I felt really lost in the story, but from what I can gather the Lore wasn't really a big part of the game.Anyway, it's a good shooter, however not a scary one and the lore isn't that immersive. 7/10			"

												Everyone is like ""This is the worst game ever, dont buy it"" FEAR 3 is by no means a bad game. It is actually a fantastic and entertaining shooter. People have just been spoiled by how incredible the first FEAR was. FEAR 3 modernized the franchise and simplified a ton of the aspects of the gameplay, but it is 100 times better than FEAR 2. It is also better than most shooters today and has some awesome moments and great voice acting. The AI is not as good as the original FEAR, but it is way better than FEAR 2. To me, FEAR 3 feels like a modern version of the original FEAR. There is regenrating health, the graphics arn't blurry (im talking to you FEAR 2), you can only hold two weapons, there is a cover system that you dont even have to use if u dont want to... Sure, the story went a bit off road compared to the rest of the games, but Its a great game, give it a try.			"

												OK, I played this game twice, first time solo in a single player and second time in a coop and it was a blast both times.Thogh it might seem dated nowadays (jees, did 5 years really passed by already?), it has good design, solid gameplay and great story.I have to admit, I have a thing for a Fear series and the univers and I love both the setting and a story, so I really loved playing all of this stuff and seing familiar locations and familiar characters.While this whole stuff might not be interesting enough to play the game, the most important fact about F3AR is that it is co-op shooter which was primarily designed as such with assymetric gameplay, two different characters with completely separate skill trees and combat mechanics and a story line tied to the coop gameplay.Co-op games are are rare breed and good coop shooters are virtually non existing and if you are looking for this kind of game you should definitely give it a try.

												And I thought F.E.A.R. 2 was a good game, this one is even better.After finishing and enjoying F.E.A.R. 2 I got started on playing F.3.A.R. pretty much straightaway and I was at first not as impressed with the game compared to the previous one. Just a couple of silly things like how they changed the combat and removed health packs and armour but I soon got used to using the radial red/blood onscreen to know when to hide and when to push forward into combat. The story with this one was really, really good and the cutscenes were superbly done. I would've said this game was about as good as 2 but no better, that was until I completed the game as Pointman and unlocked Fettel.  Oh boy. Playing as Fettel elevated this game above F.E.A.R. 2 instantly. I played it through to completion again with Fettel and it didn't feel stale in any way because Fettel is just the most ridiculous fun you can have in a game. I can't use any more superlatives and you should probably buy this series of games and enjoy them.I recommend this game more than I recommended 2 in my review for that. Massive fun on both play throughs but the Fettel one is best. Get this game!			"

												This game is absolutely terrible. The devs turned this once awesome horror series into an action oriented co-op shooter.First off the ""horror"" parts in this game are neither creepy nor frightening, they're simply annoying. FEAR and Project Origin did their job far better in this regard. In addition to describe the A.I. as weak in this game would be an understatement. It was a huge step backwards from the previous games.If you don't play this game in co-op be prepared for very unfair fights. How about fighting a mech with little to no cover or possibilities to avoid damage and your opponent having a huge amount of health and hitting like a truck? Sounds fun doesn't it? (not to me) - The ""boss fights"" are not really what I'd call challenging as they don't require that much thinking. It's just kill them faster than they can kill you.The story is just a mess. Characters from the previous games don't make any sense and there are plotholes all over the place.Finally from what I saw the multiplayer was dead on arrival. There was only these gauntlet like missions and no real player vs player action. But even in these co-op missions you have to compete against your teammates. If you are to slow or not good enough you will be left behind or have a negative influence on the overall performance. I don't know who designed it, but it wasn't thought out very well.			"

												I guess this game had a pretty large focus on multiplayer, both co-op and competitive, but no one else is playing it so I can only review the single player, which, at it's heart, is a mediocre shooter.  It tries to spice things up with a first person cover mechanic, but it doesn't add very much in terms of usefulness.  In fact, it's a bit wonky and often times hinders you.  There were several times I was hit while ""in cover"" without being able to see the enemy in front of me.  Fetel's possession and psychic mechanics seemed fun, but you need to complete missions as point man first to unlock him.  I only played him for a few missions.Spooks are pretty half-hearted and sparse in this last installment of the FEAR series.  A big part of that coming from not really interacting with Alma at all.  Nearly all dialogue is given to you through your bro. who is disturbing, but not really scary.  Alma was center stage for FEAR 2, and it's what made for great spooks.  Here you barely feel her presence at all and her personality is nonexistant.  Some sections of the game look very dated graphically.  Much more so than FEAR 2(as I remember it).  Some approaching FEAR 1 levels of meh.  This usually isn't a concern for me, but it has me scratching my head on how much of a graphical downgrade they seem to have had between sequels.The sound design is pretty terrible.  FEAR never really had satisfying gun sounds, but sometimes there will be something that happens in a scripted scene, like a head exploding, and there will be no sound effect paired with it at all.  Pretty immersion breaking.Overall an OK shooter with tepid spooks.4/10			"

												Every time I see FEAR 3 on sale I see people bashing it as the worst in the series, but the meta score is actually not too bad 74/100. Unlike the first 2 FEAR games, FEAR 3 has one of those regenerating health systems where you just hide under cover for a few seconds and you recover back to full health. No need to scrounge for med kits or armor. Also, the game seems built around 2 player co-op, which I like in first person shooter games (when I have someone to play with).*Spoilers ahead*FEAR 3 takes place an unspecified amount of time after the events of FEAR 2. Alma is pregnant and getting ready to give birth, as a result her psychic power is tearing up the city (possibly the world). Again the main opposition is the private military contractor Armacham, who seems to have become 100x more powerful than they were in the first games. Even without their clone super soldiers from the first games, Armacham seems capable of overrunning and occupying entire cities with soldiers, aircraft, and power armor. You play the Point Man protagonist from the first FEAR game (the guy you play in FEAR 2 also shows up briefly) but this time you have an “imaginary” friend Paxton Fettel (Bad guy from the first game). Your primary goal this time around is to reach Alma before she gives birth and deal with her once and for all. Unfortunately for you, Alma’s psychic pain has summoned nightmare creatures and twisted the surviving civilian population into crazed psychos.Unlike the previous FEAR games, FEAR 3 is broken down into missions or “levels” with each mission giving you a point score at the end. You gain points by finding collectables, killing enemies, and completing “challenges.” The challenges are similar to the “Skill shots” in Bulletstorm, where it’s basically just using various methods of killing. For example, 2000 points for killing enemies with a specific weapon, or 1000 points for getting 25 headshots, or 2000 points for getting 3 backstabs. The points aren’t just for show, by the way. You “level up” when you gain enough points and each level gives you some kind of perk, such as +10% health or +bullet capacity. You can replay levels as many times as you want to “grind” for points. This means that the game will get easier over time as you replay it. You might notice that when you first start the game, it seems far more difficult than the previous ones, well this changes as you level up and get stronger. The regenerating health means you can charge groups of enemies and just duck for cover when your screen is almost completely red (near death). Healing is free unlike FEAR 1 and 2 which had limited med kits.As I mentioned earlier, the game is built with 2 player co-op in mind. At the end of each mission there is a ranking between the 2 players to see who scored highest in several categories. The game’s ending depends on which of the two characters “won” the most missions. Of course if you’re playing single player the character you’re playing (Fettel or Point Man) will “win” every level you complete. Point Man’s gameplay is the same as the previous games (standard shooter with Slow-Mo power), But Fettel is a psychic commander. This means he can possess enemies and use them to fight (he doesn’t have slow-mo). Every time he takes over a new body he gets the weapons of the possessed enemy, so you can’t hoard powerful weapons or grenades the way Point Man does. You can only hold 2 weapons now, unlike 3 weapons in FEAR 1 and 4 weapons in FEAR 2. Possession also means you won’t be able to use the awesome power armors because the possessed body won’t last long enough. Pros:+Excellent graphics and visuals. Large variety of weapons available.+Some cool new enemies, particular the Phase Commander and Phase Caster.+A lot of replay value. I just finished the game and immediately restarted as Fettel. +2 player co-op available. Also a bunch of various multiplayer game modes I haven’t tried.Cons:-The game is very short, about 6 hours to beat the first time. Replay is strongly encouraged though.-The story is weaker than the first FEAR games. There’re a lot of unnecessary “dream sequences” that don’t seem to add much. You just walk forward about 15 seconds with someone talking in voice over and it ends.-I get the feeling that the enemies are much “dumber” than FEAR 1 enemies. They tend to stick behind the same piece of cover and just pop their heads out to shoot from there.Overall I think the game is well worth playing for fans of First Person Shooters and people who want to see how the FEAR story ends. Once you finish a mission in single player, the Fettel character is unlocked so you can try playing him for that particular level. The way to see the Fettel game ending is by playing through the game a second time (or play the game in co-op and Fettel has the highest score every mission). One thing I noticed is that the game’s Steam achievements seem to be half for multiplayer, and not many people are playing the multiplayer. This isn’t surprising since the game has been out for a few years. I’ll probably only be able to get about 45% completion for the game achievements by myself.			"

												""How the mighty have fallen"", said Pius Augustus to Mantorok. I think the same applies here. The first FEAR was a ""visceral"" FPS, offering an honest challenge and a great atmosphere. FEAR2 was much less horror, more streamlined, but still OK.Alas, a common plague in the video game industry is the need to make trilogies, when it's uncalled for or there is not enough substance for it- or both. F3AR falls in this category. Sure, the fate of Alma was still hanging after the end of the previous game, but this one has nothing to tell. Story has not to be the strong point of a FPS, but when it's that shallow, it impacts the game itself.F3AR is very short (5 to six hours) with only 8 levels, two of wich are fillers (the store after the first crash, the bridge after the second crash) and the last is an dream-like stage, glorified string of mini-cutscenes culminating with the destruction of Harlan Wade (wich, of course, is a giant abomination with a glowing weak point). So the only goal is to rejoin Alma whose psychic contractions are bringing doom to Fairport and its surroundings. F3AR fails what I like to call the Teleportation Test : when a story can be resolved with just the protagonist(s) being teleported to a certain location. And it's exactly the case with F3AR. There is no need for character development, nothing to seek or activate, nothing to accomplish really, just go see Mother. Jin (who, because Plot, is now dear to Pointman's heart ?) is just needed to pinpoint a certain location and is discaded afterwards. Now, of course, all this could be forgiven with brilliant gameplay. No such luck here. Using Pointman's slow-mo power is still fun, but kinda loses its edge after two games. Weaponry doesn't have anything outstanding, apart maybe for the impaler thingie, and even using mechas is not as fun as it could be. The level-design is dull and makes for a very, very linear progression. Of course you gather ammo, otherwise, the only things to seek are corpses to ""consume""... For points. Doing certain feats (headshots...) also grant you points, and every now and then you will ""level-up"" to gain new skills (that you can't choose, of course). If you play in co-op, points also determine who will be the favorite son, hence deciding the ending. The first player is Pointman, the other one is Fettel, who can blast psychic rays and possess people, giving a bit more fun. This co-op option is a good thing, because I sincerely think it's the only way to get some real enjoyment from the game. As far as I tried, multiplayer is dead and the campaign has little to no replay value. My advice ? If you want a few laughs, wait for a -75% discount, find a friend to play it with during a rainy afternoon and call it a day. Of, and course, even if the game tries to be creepy, forget about the horror feeling of the first game. Here, it's mainly Doomsday mixed with mad men, some gore and demons.			"

												Oh F.E.A.R. 3 oh how I wish you were absolutely perfect. Let's go ahead and get this review started! I'm going to recommend this game, BUT only if it is on sale. It's definitely not worth $20, and I luckily got it while it was 75% off. I played through the campaign with a friend of mine, and we beat it in under five hours. The game is extremely short! There are a few jump scares here and there, but nothing to have nightmares about. The graphics are alright for a game that was released back in 2011. Besides a few issues, the game was pretty fun. I liked the combat, and the story was very intriguing!Again, don't buy F.E.A.R. 3 unless it is on sale. I really wish the campaign was twenty hours instead of five because I was really enjoying the suspense, blood, and all those jolly things. To wrap this review up, the game is worth $5 and no more than that. If you like interesting stories full of gore and are fans of previous F.E.A.R. games then I recommend you get this immediately. Also, if you play with a friend it is probably 100x the fun compared to playing by yourself. If I were to rate this game, it'd probably be a solid 7/10. Could have been worse, could have been better.			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 is a FPS game that has more action and less horror than the previous F.E.A.R. games. The main campaign can be played solo or co-op and you can choose between 2 different characters, each with their own unique abilities. The main campaign is pretty short (less than 10 hours), but you can replay it as a different character. There are also additional Co-op and VS modes that can add hours of gameplay.Overall, I give F.E.A.R. 3 a rating of 7.5/10.			"

												I loved the first two games in the F.E.A.R. franchise. I loved the insane action, slow-motion roundhouse kicks and bodies exploding into Jell-O(tm) when you pumped a shell into them. I loved the freaky-deaky story, the mysterious protagonist(s) and the occasional flirt with enigmatic storytelling, the screeching, violin-falling-down-the-stairs soundtrack that worked in all its beautiful discordance and hair-raising abruptness. The scripted scares wove ladders, hallways, doors and windows into shockingly intricate little spookouts that contrasted with the bombastic shootouts that framed them, and it all just worked out so WELL. Hell, even the ending of the second game was pretty good in my eyes.And then this game. Oh boy.I hardly know what to say about it, and I hardly have the energy- even now- to summon a full-blown rant on this marvelous marvelous deconstruction of a once-great shooter franchise. The scares? Gone. The lonesome eeriness? Gone. Hope you like playing co-operatively with your psychic *** brother who has lost all of his charm now that you can see how he works and he's always trotting along beside you like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ doberman. The Half-Life-esque presentation that kept you in the protagonist's perspective constantly and almost never thrust you into immersion-punching cutscenes? Hope you didn't like them, because apparently neither did WB. Did I mention that this game isn't scary?It gets most of the action from previous titles right, but it's more than just lacking in the horror department. The game called... CALLED... 'Fear'? It doesn't even try to be scary. At all.			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 is a First Person Horror Shooter.It continues the story line of F.E.A.R. 1 and 2 but here you are again the protagonist from the first game.The Point Man, one of Almas childs. And actually you can play 2 characters, the other one being Paxton Fettel, the other son of Alma, but only when you have finished the game once. There are 2 different endings. The first, which is probably the ""real"" ending is the good one of the Point Man and the other one is the Evil end of Paxton Fettel.The Story itself is easy explained. You have to reach Alma because she is giving birth to her new child.But this is a hard and stony way especially because you have to escape from a prison first but because both brothers working together it works. Working together more or less. But beside you are hunted by your bad memories of your childhood which feature Harlan Wade, the ""father"" of Alma. Saying father is this case is an insult because he is a real ****, well you know what I mean. You have to forget your memories of Harlan Wade.On your way you pass many levels and especially different ones! No level looks the same and this is actually what was really amazing! Never saw so much variety and nice design in the levels. Pretty much the best from all F.E.A.R. games but this is probably the only aspect thats better compared to other games, sadly.The game implemented a new Health system what I like to call CoD illness. Really annoying and I missed the Medipacks and armor. It wasnt that bad after all but seriously, why did you have to add this feature to a F.E.A.R. game?There is also a new level system which I like to call CoD level illness. You get XP for getting Kill rewards or collecting things. Never liked it but to be honest its not that bad implemented here. With ""ranking"" up you also get new Skills or upgrades. While playing this game I noticed that this game is pretty much build up for Multiplayer or Coop. Annoyed me a bit to be honest, I hate games where Singleplayer campaigns doesnt feel like Singleplayer campaigns.For me this game was a little bit difficult sometimes, I played on Normal difficulty. But this difficulty was more because of the damn bloodscreen. I hate this and it makes the game hectic.The scare level is a little bit less I have to say but there were still some nice level parts which scared me. Not as many as before though. You are not hunted by Alma in this game anyway. Alma got nearly friendly, I really like how the developers changed Alma. For me she was never that evil anyway, I even liked her. She had just a bad history.[SPOILER!] (I try to let them out but in this case I have to say it because its a bad thing for me about the game)But what really made me sad is the fact that Alma dies in the end anyway, why letting the main character die like this? If you play the game you know what I mean. A really stupid and wasted death for Alma. I hope her child can offer us a similar experience in F.E.A.R. 4, if it will be ever released. Cant tell actually. Maybe this was the final game. Also Becket dies in a poor and questionable way... WHY? This didnt even make any sense. Especially how they made Becket. I mean the 1-2 minutes he actually appears in a cutscene. Yeah, the character was silent in F.E.A.R. 2 but here they just made him like a poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ which wants to end his miserable life. Couldnt they make something more interesting like he teamed up with Alma or something? Its his child after all... Bad decision. They could have made the story so much better.The graphics of the game are ok but nothing special. Similar to F.E.A.R. 2s graphics.It has to be said that this game was developed by another studio, not Monolith.Monolith just provided some help. The main developer was Day 1 Studios.Noticeable concerning the changes but wasnt that bad for a indie sort of developer.I had time to play the campaign in coop with my girlfriend.It was actually a little bit more enjoyable in coop, especially playing with Fettel.First time I played with him and it was a completely different gameplay.You can actually move into enemies bodies and control them. This is only for a limited time though. But you can extend it with collecting their souls after they die.When you are not inside of an enemy you can shoot some sort of projectiles from your hand.You can also grab your enemies from far away. I actually had quite some fun playing in Coop.In the end there is a comparison of the statistics of both players and who actually wins the playthrough. This characters ending is played then. I personally felt like Fettel was more powerful than the Pointman. Unbalanced maybe, no clue.This is where the game actually proper shines in my opinion.And this is actually the only reason for me to replay it sometimes...Never the less, Singleplayer is just mediocre.Postitive:- Nice variety of environments in levels- Solid shooter gameplay, little bit similar to F.E.A.R. 2s.- Some scares, not as many as before- Good Coop- Fettel is a interesting gameplay characterNegative:- Too... Much... CoD...- Levels/Ranks useless beside of Coop- Questionable story decisions- Singleplayer is kinda boring, made for Coop...- 5 Hour campaign- Graphics outdated (2011)- Soundtrack is different and worse- Probably the last F.E.A.R. ever... F.E.A.R. Online just made it worse.Replayability: Only for CoopWell, thats everything that needs to be said I think.F.E.A.R. 3 was a good game for me but with a little bitter taste, especially at the end.It didnt feel like a proper F.E.A.R. anymore. Only replayable for Coop.The story is actually kind of disappointing. The devs totally wasted a lot of potencial here.Why did Monolith give this game away to another developer? Seriously? Actually I feel like they killed the franchise with this action. Or maybe it was WB who wanted to milk the franchise to death?I hope you take responsibility for this Monolith or WB. This is how you NOT do it.Well, the devs of F.E.A.R. 3 still did somewhat a solid job, even if the end product is far away from the quality of the first 2 F.E.A.R.s.My rating would be 6.5/10 points.The other games, except the addons/dlcs got always better ratings.I think this is a fair score and I cant give more without feeling to overrate it.

												Yuck! Consolized rubbish. Nothing like the previous versions. Finished it in a short period of time, and I was glad for it. Get FEAR 1 and 2 and the DLC for those, but give 3 a miss, unless you are 100% sure you want to play all the way through with a friend, because admittedly the way co-op works is a nice enough idea.

												My mark for this game is not negative just because this is F.E.A.R. The first part of this game had an outstanding graphics for the date of its release, it had a lot of moments which would make you turn grey. But here you can see no particular graphics (but i should say that it is not too awful). No real moments that are to scare you, just some nervous screams will put you out for a moment. The plot is rather interesting, but it could be better, The first part was even more technological than this one, excepting an ability to use battle robo machines. If you like challenge (i had an ability to trace it there) and a rain of bullets - this game is for you. Still I would advise you to take this game while it is on sale - the price is too high for its presentation.			"

												If F.E.A.R. 3 injects a bit of originality in the approach to the franchise, certain ideas fall flat. Indeed, having capitalized on a ""scoring"" aspect, the developers have even more attenuated clean visceral quality to the first episode. This change, in the line of the FEAR 2 and coupled with a still good AI, has the merit to bring a lot of dynamism to the gunfights. In addition, his Coop and Multiplayer, limited to 4 players but original, eventually lengthen the lifespan. Ultimately, immersion is lost what is gained in intensity. Some like it, some not, but difficult to point the finger only the final result on the bases of a first, and to some extent a second episode, thought differently. Unfortunate that the end is so random.			"

												So i have beat this on console and bought it on sale to play some of the co-op with my friend when it was 75% off. The co-op is fun but virtually any game that isn’t flat awful or broken is pretty fun with friends. There are two characters with different game play, the series original Point Man and Paxton Fettel. Here are the pros and cons of the PC version.Pros- Paxton Fettel is really fun to play as with unique and fun interesting paranormal abilities like possession.- Has a Co-op campaign- A nice achievement and upgrade system- You have a nice set of customizable controls with secondary bindings for all functions- Nice sound options with multiple slidersCons- Simple console like FPS cover based shooting. Press Q then arrows to pop out from cover shoot use bullet time to change cover repeat- Instead of mildly tactical squad based combat you push through a crowed, fight a hoard, push through crowd again. - Fairly linear with much less alternative routes then the two predecessors- The bullet time for point man is essentially useless and just thrown in because it is part of the series- Not a great port with some bad low res textures and limited graphics options- Super unbalanced Riot shield, find it, win- for the price a little too short. Took me almost 7 hours on console to beat- Multiplayer is pretty much dead and was tacked on anyway- Simple contrived plot- Adds nothing to the story of the franchise and in fact is kind of an insult to fans not that the other two had great ones, but it doesn’t fit into the universe (if you don’t care about story like me though that doesn’t matter much)- Horrible main character ,rugged, scruffy, boring, robotic, bad♥♥♥♥♥ action hero template number 4 instead of the silent protagonist (again you can get past that easily but if that stuff matters to you it will probably disappoint)My verdictGeneric and not worth your time; It is another drop in the sea of mediocrity. Play F.E.A.R or F.E.A.R 2 instead, they are both much better games in every aspect. Unless you get it on a good sale to mess around with as Paxton Fettel it isn’t worth your time or money.			"

												If you are the type of person that doesn’t like to read a long review, then I will provide you with a short description which properly conveys the message of my full-review. DON’T BUY THIS GAME expecting the same type of game play as the previous F.E.A.R installments. HOWEVER IF YOU LIKE THROWING AWAY MONEY AND PLAYING A BADLY PORTED COD STYLE FPS FOR P_SSIES THAT LIKE TO HIDE BEHIND COVER 90% OF THE TIME I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. OK, now that this is said, I shall begin with my full-review of the game. First off, I would like to point out that I have played both F.E.A.R and F.E.A.R 2 and had a blast of a time while playing them. I really loved the style of the games, and I would say that F.E.A.R. 1 is the best out of the entire series.Now onto F.E.A.R 3 …The game starts with some nice cut-scenes that manage to get me all hyped up to play another F.E.A.R.  game. As soon as these cut-scenes end I get the mission to escape from a prison. At that point I could already tell that the game has a different feel to it, like it wasn’t as dark as the previous games.  But I didn’t care about that and continue playing. So after walking out of my prison cell the game starts explaining the controls and after killing a guard I get my first gun.  Now I am ready to once again become a bad 4ss MOF0 and bust some caps, or so I thought…NOPE NOPE NOPE.jpeg; As soon as the action starts and I end up in my first shootout the game explains that you need to use Q to hide.  Now.. hiding isn’t that bad I mean it’s logical to hide to avoid ending up like Swiss cheese.  But this game brings it to a whole new level, the being a little p_ssy level.  The map is obviously designed so you have to hide behind every other f_cking box. And as soon as you get shot, you lose an unknown amount of health and you can simply regenerate it by hiding for 5 f_cking seconds.  So where is the challenge to managing your health by using the med kits like in the previous games?  And why are we hiding all the f_cking time, point man used to be a bad 4ss.  OK this is also the moment I start to feel like the game wasn’t developed for the PC and is actually a cheap port. So even with all of that going on I continue my escape from prison whilst encountering several shootouts and getting annoyed about the whole continuously hiding behind boxes and having the unnatural feeling of playing a bad port.  This goes on for a while and I finally decide that this game is a piece of sh!t.. and I got better games to play.So how did the fear series end up with this piece of sh!t? It’s because this game wasn’t even developed by the same company that developed the initial fear games.  NOPE not developed by Monolith but by Day 1 Studios. Anyhow thank the seven gods that I bought this game in a steam sale and did not have to pay full price. Because after just about 15 minutes of play time I decided it was a piece of sh_t and uninstalled the game. And I didn’t even get to die once.. So I guess you are practically immortal in this game as long as you hide behind boxes.			"

												As an FPS, it's decent. As a F.E.A.R. game, it's garbage. The atmospheric tension and spookiness of the first game is completely gone, favoring more traditional jump and grotesque scares. The long and short of it? The game isn't scary in the slightest. If you're looking for a co-op FPS at a decent price, I'm sure you could get something out of this. If you're a fan of the FEAR series and you're looking for more of what made the first game great, you will be disappointed.			"

												This game is really fun in co-op. Fun to play as Fettel or Pointman, each with their own specific powers. The horror is mostly gone from the previous games and it is more Call Of Duty like, with regenerating health. So this game is maybe not for everyone. But there's a lot of fun to be had getting all challenges and high scores on each interval done. Raking up all the specific kills with each gun, or kills after mantling an object etc.For those that only play it once for story it may feel disappointing but there's a lot of replayability playing as Fettel, or solo/co-op. All F.E.A.R. games have been amazing in my opinion.			"

												What to say about this game... it's pretty and all that, but it's rather disappointing. It's nowhere near as memorable as the previous game in the series. The campaign story is confusing and uninteresting. Scary events aren't really scary. There's co-op mode around this time though, which helps. There's also four different multiplayer modes, which I haven't played much, but they feel slapped on. I'd say they are okay, but nothing more. I'm not sure what else to say. Not a particularly good game, but an ok co-op shooter. I'm leaning more towards the negative side than the positive side, so it's a thumbs down from me. Consider getting it if it's cheap.			"

												This game showed me true horror - because someone incompetent inheriting a great franchise and turning it into... THIS, now that's what I call terror.Nothing to do with F.E.A.R. series. It's a budget-tier mix of CoD and Painkiller. No atmosphere, no suspense, 2 weapons limit, so corridor-ish it's not even funny. Shooting itself was always a strong point of F.E.A.R., here it feels bland and unsatisfying. There's the autoregen instead of hitpoints, which I could tolerate if this wasn't supposed to be a horror game. Also someone thought it needs some Cool&Hip (tm) pseudo RPG elements, so you gain points for stuff like picking up ammo and recieve bonuses, i.e. a bigger ammo limit.I really warn you against this game, there are indie shooters much better than this ""blockbuster"".

												Pure and utter garbage.F.E.A.R 3 Ultima Ascension of the FEAR franchise. After but 5 minutes the plot collapses in on itself and twists and turns a previous tactical shooter into a CoD clone for 10 year olds. The Gameplay is average. Gone is still the uber shotgun from FEAR 1 and so is the enemy AI. The game is so easy on next to hardest difficulty Fearless, and the hardest one being Insane which is locked until you finish the game at least once. No effort was required of me as I blasted enemies to dust and only died when I was either stupid or engaged in honorable melee with the enemy.The levels are boring and repetitive, and the level transition will leave you confused. At an early point in the game, you are trying to flee the city, and get shot down while doing so, and after crashing you immediately return to the city. What!? Oh, also, Point Man crashes, explodes and falls from mortal heights and still survives, It's a cliché nowadays but it's still complete garbage to look at. Levels consists of open areas with enemies spawning around a small map. Kill enemies, proceed through a corridor to the next big area, and repeat. It's also that annoying kind of map that won't allow you to jump over things the devs don't want you to jump over! Want to jump over this couch? Can't do that. Want to crouch under this railing? Can't do that. But you can only crouch under the only thing that will continue the on rail shooting segments. The pacing is♥♥♥♥♥♥as well, there is no time for you to breath out between battles, no puzzles of any kind exists other then, press button, open door kind. Not like you'll ever get worked up playing this PoS since the scary/creepy parts are all but gone. If this game didn't have FEAR in the name I would never have associated it with the series att all.Story collapsed in on itself after about 5 minutes. Why answer questions like: Where are we? Why am I here? What am I suppose to do? Point Man apparently has character now, which is funny since he's a silent MP, so It's stupid. Also Fettel now apparently thinks family is super important and now wants to help you/you help him to get you to mother. Why is he there? Is another question I asked myself since you did put a bullet in his head in the first game. And now he is ghost, or, something, but still needs to walk through doors. I don't care anymore, why should I when the devs didn't care either. Also dead characters are alive as well that died in FEAR Extraction Point expansion for the first game but I guess, RETCON! Didn't happen, character is alive now, hurray! Or the expansion simply weren't canon, but FEAR 2's dlc was! Cuz Fettel.Kuk fitt spel. One of the worst sequels I've played, it fails on every level, and It's not even fun on a terribad level. Just bad all around and makes you sad that It's a part of a far greater series.			"

												Just beat F.E.A.R. 3, making me beat every single F.E.A.R. game, okay review time, this game, while not bad, was good in aspects and bad at everything else. let alone, as a fan of the series, this game was kinda a let down too me. I enjoyed the fast pace combat, but it took out all stragity that made the first and second games a hard deal, you actual had to plan out your combat route, know when to use slow-mo, and keep ur wits on guard, Playing as paxton can be pretty fun aswell, as it's a diffrent kinda play to the Series. slo-mo in F.E.A.R. 3 had sometimes almost no propose because by time u use it, its gone already, F.E.A.R. 3 compared to the others had minimum to no horror aspect, no dark atmosphere, and quite frankly, the story line was poor and kinda boring. they tried to escalate the matter of the situation, without telling us why it's happening. Taking out the replica forces made NO sense to me, and they never Evan explain why there not there, i mean they were in 2, and still being controlled, so why not in 3, and why the ♥♥♥♥ is point man in captivity when at the end of F.E.A.R. 1 he escaped with his team. F.E.A.R. 3 has beautiful graphics, smooth game play, brutal combat, and an interesting Ranking system. As for story line, atmosphere, tone, and excitability, it was a huge let down, i have to say by far F.E.A.R. 2 was the best in the series. F.E.A.R. 3 just feels more like call of duty when it trys to be creepy. this is a great stand alone game, esp for FPS fans, but for personal fans of the F.E.A.R. Series as a whole, this is just a disappointment. hopefully, if they make another game, they will try to make it less ""Call of dutyish"" and return to the Dark, disturbing, amazing storyline that F.E.A.R. use to be. What they gained in making fast paced action game play, made it less horror, and less stragidy and more just shoot shoot shoot. and where are my martial arts melee attacks that were so fun to pull off. like i said though, good standalone game, but with the F.E.A.R. logo, its a let downStandalone game: 7/10F.E.A.R.

												Before you will sit down at game, it is necessary to reconcile to one fact: name F.E.A.R. for the game Day 1 Studios — not a native name, and a pseudonym. Others surname entered in the passport by adoptive parents — publishers that it was simpler to push the offspring in society. That F.E.A.R. from which blood ran cold six years ago, didn't return. Day 1 Studios so were fond of idea ""to refresh"" a series that as a result made absolutely independent game. Well or brought to logical end the transformation which has begun still in the second part unique in own way a horror in a banal shooter ""with elements"". The idea to rely on a multiplayer as a whole and cooperative in particular seemed to us rotten from the moment of the game announcement — it all the same that to turn Silent Hill into a network shooter. F.E.A.R. always I was famous for a single with its oppressive, frightening atmosphere. Single where the player remained in private with the fears where in each dark corner the monster seemed and the finger itself involuntarily reaped on a♥♥♥♥♥♥in response to the creaked floor. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).			"

												I always heard bad things about F.E.A.R. 3 and the first few hours of me playing it gave me all I need to make my own opinion about the game. If you're a fan of the original F.E.A.R. you turn back right now, otherwise you'll most likely loose your admiration for this franchise. To be honest I didn't really liked F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin as much as I liked the first F.E.A.R. game and it's expansions, it did have the F.E.A.R. feel to it but for me it wasn't as good as the original. But now, F.E.A.R. 3 is where they've messed up everything, everything I liked about the previous games was gone. First, there's no medkits or reflex boosts on the game because you now have regenerating health and you unlock levels, and yes I do mean actual ingame levels, by scoring points, I feel like they tried making F.E.A.R. 3 a kinda of score attack game but making it similar to modern first person shooters. So, if there's no medkits and reflex boosts there's not that much of incentive to go through each level exploring and trying to find hidden stuff to make your life easier... but then again they've changed that, most of the hidden stuff that you can now find in F.E.A.R. 3 are corpses which you can ""connect to"" and gain points by doing so and also finding some weird little statues that I also believe that give you points. Everytime you level up you can gain an increase to HP, increased time that you can use your slow time and increased ammo for each gun. I pretty much hate when developers nowadays make first person shooters with regenerating health because that basicly just means that everytime you're on low health you just need to get behind a wall and wait for your health to regenerate which I find to be somewhat, dumb. And now the guns. I thought that the shooting from F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin was easier than the original F.E.A.R. but hell did they make it Call of Duty style on F.E.A.R. 3, you can pretty much just spray and pray with any gun without aiming down sights and you'll still get the kills even in long range with a shotgun, I realize that this might be appealing to some people out there but for a guy like me who likes guns to have a real kick to them and feel authentic when shooting and having the need to compensate recoil and spray patterns I find this Call of Duty style of gun handling to be really frustrating, so what's a first person shooter with shooting that people don't like?, yeah. And now, the story, maybe it was just me but I had the feeling during the whole game that the game was trying to shove you the story all the time, I didn't really get much of it and also they did it in kind of a weird way. I think F.E.A.R. 3 was designed as a co-op game because everytime there's a cutscene, and yes there's now cutscenes on a F.E.A.R. game, it's always the two brothers talking and by the time it ends you have the feeling that you're supposed to start a mission with you and your brother fighting the ""bad guys"" but no, there's just one of you there, and I find that to be rather weird because a few seconds ago there were two people there, couldn't they just put the other brother as an AI companion? One thing I certainly have to mention is that the enemy AI, mainly the soldiers is pretty well made, everytime you try to get behind cover they try to flank you while others distract you by providing supressive fire and enemies usually always go looking for cover as soon as they spot you and they even flip furniture in order to get cover behind it. The last thing I really hated about F.E.A.R. 3 and I'm sure many people will agree with me on this, is that the game despite looking pretty damn good it isn't scary at all, the F.E.A.R. franchise was supposed to be abunch of scary first person shooters with some paranormal elements and that ocurred in the previous game but in this one it kinda turned into a demonic invasion, creatures spawning from the walls through some kind of portals and at the end nothing pretty much made any sense to me, for me F.E.A.R. 3 looked more like fighting a demonic invasion other than fighting horror  and Alma and they pretty much failed on the scary and tense component from the previous games. The first F.E.A.R. was very tense and spooky, F.E.A.R. 2 was not that much but it still had some tense sections and some ocasional jumpscares while F.E.A.R. 3 is just a run and gun shooter. As you can clearly see I did not liked F.E.A.R. 3 at all, it is certainly a good game but not what I expected from a F.E.A.R. game. If you're a fan of the F.E.A.R. franchise I advise you not to play this or only playing it if you're curious about the story but if you haven't played any of the F.E.A.R. games you might enjoy your time with this one, I don't know honestly. Personally I don't recommend this one.			"

												I have always been an avid fan of the FEAR franchise. Fear 3 is the 3rd and probably most unique installment of this franchise. I am wondering if this should be considered the last one or WB is planning to publish another episode sometime in the near future.In Fear 2 we skipped the story of the good old Point Man, our protagonist from the 1st episode, and now we pick up his tale from where we were left off. Paxton also returns and this gives a game a unique experience as coop campaign is now available. Paxton can jump into enemies and take over them for a short period of time. On his own he is rather weak but once you possess a soldier you can use his weapons and should you be eliminated you can quickly find another host.Sequences with the Mech also return and they are more devastating than ever. There are more monsters now so it seems the developers upped the horror-like nature of the game a bit. Single player is relatively long and with the 2nd protagonist (Paxton) you have replayability here which is good news. The field where Fear 3 really shines is multiplayer. There are various game modes out there that are interesting and challenging, too. In F**king Run, for example, you are running away from a wall that means instant death once it reaches you. While running away you also need to eliminate the oncoming waves of enemies and cooperation is a must as if anybody from your team is caught by the wall that's game over for the entire group. I liked Fear 3. For me the best is the 2nd episode in this trilogy but the 3rd installment also offered an exciting action-horror experience and while I do not really favour the approach of releasing more and more sequels for a game I would be delighted to play a possible 4th episode.

												Initially I was severly disappointed. Now that I have finished the game I find that I enjoyed it but it could have been so much more. This should have been an awesome trilogy ending game. Instead it was an average FPS with a little paranormal thrown in riding on the coat tails of past titles of the same series.			"

												So after having played every fear game back to back I have to say that this game is an exterme let down. The story is disjointed, sloppy, and unintresting compared to the other fear games while also lacking the atmosphere that the previous games had. The only positive thing about this game is that it looks decent and the controls aren't bad other than that it's a generic FPS with nothing going for it.			"

												Pretty much the worst game in the series. F.E.A.R. has totally lost it, so prepare to get involved into a terrible story combined with awful gameplay and spiced up with ugly visuals. Unfortunately, there's no chance to get some fun from co-op either, for it's all about trying to make it through the hordes of stupid enemies without any sensible reason.I'd really like to have anything good to say about the triquel, and I actually liked the first two games, but honestly - F.E.A.R. 3 is the most ridiculous way to end the storyline ever imaginable.

												Fast, action packed with really nice graphics - what more can you want.Underrated and over criticised - in my experiencew quite a few reviews are just unfair, particularly where graphics, performance and gameplay are concerned.Im on Windows 10 and it runs flawlessly in 4K, looks really nice, as an example the sunset  coming through a window and displayed on a wall. But ive got a good TV and ive got the settings configured to make it look nice.Yeh its not not just your GPU and the game, set your TV to complement the graphics.I dont know why the AI gets dumped on so much - seems pretty good to me - enemies take cover most of the time and run around trying to outflank you, i aint come across any AI better than that and i aint come across any AI that was intelligent, cos its AI, its a computer.And if a game aint the same as one you played 10 years ago you gotta get over it - it aint fair on the Devs.Im loving the action and the sweet, fast responsive controls make it really exciting, your hit you dash - recover - you melee after creeping up on your foe - then theres one behind you pumping a shotgun and you gotta get away again - superb.Plus theres some good challenges.The camera - always a critical thing for me is near perfect and the 360 controller handles it great.Could have done with a map window though.Well worth the money.I believe in reviewing games in the first couple of hours, cause im a game player, i love video games, when i find one i wanna play i can play excessively till im knackered and irritated, it aint fair on the Devs to review a game when ive overplayed it.Enjoy.

												The weakest link of the F.E.A.R series. This is more like an action shooter than a horror shooter, the co-op is fun and takes about 3 or so hours. I'd advise you to get F.E.A.R 1 or 2, or even both instead of this. If you're a hardcore fan and want to see the finale, it MIGHT be worth getting.			"

												I have played the F.E.A.R. trilogy on the Xbox 360, as well as the PC. (However I have yet to finish this one yet on the PC). So here is how I feel about this game.As a shooters, is a fun game. The gun mechanics feel nice. The guns themselves feel nice. Hell, if you have a good PC running this at max settings, they look gorgeous. And I like the co-op-slash-competitive mode this game does. Whoever gets the highest score, becomes the ""favorite"" son to Alma. And you also level up in this game which increase stuff like ammo capacity, slo-mo, and whatever else.However, as a F.E.A.R. game, it is terrible. And that's why I don't recommend this for F.E.A.R. fans. F.E.A.R. 3 is the weakest installment of the series, lacking everything that made the first two great. Even F.E.A.R. 2, however others feel about it, was still faithful to the first one than this. The developers have essentionally made this as Call of Duty: Psychic Warfare.First, you are now relying on auto regen for your, now apparently low health bar. You used to be tough in previous installments, and need to find health kits to restore your health. Which was one of the things I have liked about this series. Now you can't even step out of cover without needing to GET BACK INTO cover after getting hit with a few bullets. (I'm exaggerating here, but the point is, they have basically nerfed your HP.)(Edit: I want to add really quick that I am playing this on normal difficutly. In case you're wondering if I was playing it in hard mode.)Secondly, the fear isn't there anymore. The game used to get you spooked with it's atmosphere. As supposed to the cheap jump scares studios typically do. (Which, there are some in previous installments, but they weren't heavily reliant.) Oh yeah, speaking of which, this one doesn't even have that. The atmosphere is gone. Now is just another generic first person shooter.Now, in case you're thinking, ""But what about the slo-mo? F.E.A.R. is known for that?"" So were Max Payne and True Crime. Doesn't mean anything if the game itself is still bad, does it? Yeah, it's there, but it's not like it saved this game.So overall, this is a disappointing installment. And this is after I said that it's a fun game. Perhaps if this was a different game, like say, a sequel to Blacklight, (Not counting Blacklight: Retribution) I could have given this a more positive review. Because it is a fun shooter. Generic or otherwise.If you're still thinking about buying this to see for yourself, I say wait for a steam sale, or, if you still have an Xbox 360 or PS3, see if you can find a copy for cheap. They should be around $10 or less by now.			"

About The Games:The F.E.A.R franchise has always been & always will be a game about ""The Paranormal"" expect a lot of Ghosts in each of the games more so in F.E.A.R 1 & 2. That generally has a solid story line and to be expected in a game about the paranormal plenty of gore & jump scares THESE ARE NOT BAD THINGS!F.E.A.R had you playing in the shoes of an unknown solider for the ""First Encounter Assault Recon Team"" or F.E.A.R for short, you went in and you were tasked to capture a test subject who was designed to control these ""Super Soldiers"" for a war. The project was a success except things went wrong & the leader went nutso & so you're here to clean up the mess.F.E.A.R 2 had you playing the role of another solider for the ""First Encounter Assault Recon"" who was in another squad & was deployed just before the♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan in the first game, you were tasked to find & capture a doctor who was working on the test subject & then you are to eliminate the test subject & attempt to shut down project Origin by eliminate the main ""Ghost"" who was causing all the mayhem around the city, unfortunatly things don't pan out so well & then♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan & of course once more you're trying to battle your way out of the storm.F.E.A.R 3 on the other hand has you go back into the shoes of the ""Unknown Soldier"" from F.E.A.R 1 along with the ghost of your brother Paxton Fettle who was the test subject they were developing to control the ""Super Soldiers"" & use it for the war. The story fell really flat here & it certainly wasn't as much of an enjoyable game as the first 2 were.The Review:F.E.A.R 3 offers VERY minimal satisfaction for returning fans of the original games or for Single Player gamers as it's lost everything that made the first 2 F.E.A.R games great & on edge spooky, there's very little in the way of scary scenes & there's certainly not a solid story line here as there were more with F.E.A.R 1 & F.E.A.R 2.What F.E.A.R 3 does offers us is a very solid CO-OP experience with friends, there's some very EXCELLENT game modes, and Story is a blast to play with a partner to add some excellent gameplay mechanics, Story CO-OP:1 thing F.E.A.R 3 got right was the CO-OP experience you get while playing Story. 1 Player plays as a Ghost that can use all kinds of ghostly powers & telekenetics to dispatch of the foes, this includes: Possession of Enemies to use as stealth bait (Can flank enemies & then shoot them in the back so long as you don't fire at them first or get spotted body snatching) Telekenetic Smashes Ghostly Blasts, etcWhile the other player uses Firearms & Slow Motion reflexes to eleminate his foes as the F.E.A.R opperative. Each player gets to do different things in order to help you progress in the story so you're constantly helping each other out in order to get to the next section, this improves the games experience so i recommend playing CO-OP with a friend in order to get the most out of your game experience.CO-OP Multiplayer Modes:Moving onto the CO-OP Multiplayer experience we get some really fun CO-OP Modes such as: ♥♥♥♥ing RUN!,This game mode is a fun & fresh addition to bring something new & creative to a multiplayer game mode, it's kind of like a Death Run, you're given about 30 seconds to get a head start before something dark begins chasing you from behind & if you fall too far behind or stop too long at sections for a shootout with the pursueing enemies you'll get wiped out & then you're stuck watching to see if your team can survive. (Sounds boring on paper but once you get into a game, it becomes suspenceful & interesting to see if you're fast enough to escape). Survival Mode:This game mode is a classic game mode, survive the waves of enemies for as long as you can & try to best your friends or help them out & get the best top score together. (There's nothing quite like a good team building experience for me, i just enjoy the good old Survival)Multiplayer Modes:Now onto the Multiplayer Modes here's nothing new we have our usual game modes such as: Deathmatch Last Man StandNothing ground breaking or exciting here, Multiplayer is pretty well dead & you may or may not find the occasional server here or there. I recommend just playing with friends who may also enjoy the CO-OP experience or maybe a friendly Deathmatch with a group of friends.The Verdict:Finally it all boils down to my final conclusion of this game & sad to say that it's not a good one.I'll admit that it's impossible to say i did not have any fun in this game because i did have some fun, it's just not a game to play for it's Story or for the Single Player experience. This game thrives on it's obviously designed CO-OP experience that the developers had planned from the moment they started making F.E.A.R 3.This game is also very obviously ported from a Console so expect some very average controls for the PC & also very average Graphics.If you're looking for a more satisfying Single Player or Horror experience i very, VERY, whole heartedly suggest you look at F.E.A.R 1 or F.E.A.R 2 or even both of these games, this is because they are more enjoyable for the Single Player experience & for the Gameplay, Story & on edge Horror of the Single Player mode that'll keep you from rounding the next corner for a while.The Rating:This game receives a 4/10.  This is because of a few different factors  It has a very poor Story & for a game that started off so well in this department it's just not justifyable, it seems like the Developers just said after F.E.A.R 2 released ""Oh ♥♥♥♥ the story let's just slap together the final installment & hope to god somebody buys it"" Single Player has lost all meaning now, there's no scary scenes or suspenceful moments, it's all about the gun play & it's very baddly played, you're going to much more enjoy the Campaign with a friend simply because of that unique and amazing gameplay experience you get from playing as or with a Ghosly helper. Horror is almost non-existant anymore, this franchise started off SOOOOO thick with spooky and scary elements & it really made me want to stop playing at certain times because of the feeling i got everytime i saw a shadow or light flicker on the corner of the screen or when a ghost popped out behind a wall and started whispering creepy♥♥♥♥♥♥to me. Focus on run & gun play, the final nail in the coffin if not just because they removed what made the game so unique and scary was fear of the unknown, now just leaves fear of the ""Oh what do i shoot next"", there's no longer any great moments of anticipation of when will the next ghost decide to show itself or oh god when does the next shootout happen, now it's just shootout, after shootout, after shootout, and it really never stops.And with all this stuff out of the way i need to ask myself the question. ""Do i recommend this to anyone else?""Do I Recommend This Game?:This would have to be a NO! I don't recommend this to anybody who loved the first 2 games of the franchise & i certainly don't recommend it to people who love horror, BUT! I can however recommend this game only to those who seek a unique and quite fun CO-OP experience with friends, i can only recommend it for these people.Further Reading:Check out my Review on F.E.A.R 2: Project Origin: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles01/recommended/16450/ "

[Edit]We managed to find solution to the coop issue. It seems that you and host needs to stay idle for a while in lobby and in beginning of the game in order to avoid being disconnected all of sudden. We spent 5 minutes talking at lobby and 5 minutes just standing at the beginning of a level. When we finally started to play, we managed to play several levels forward without any issues.Pros:* Coop was fun (when it works) and adds a lot to the game.* Possessing enemies were super fun. Friend in a bad spot? Posess an enemy from behind the enemy line and backstab everyone.Cons:* Scoring system sucks. Fettel will always lead in scores in normal game play (shared psychic links). Game endings are also tied to the score system. Should one of the brothers have more points than the other, it will cause good or bad ending.* The game is not scary. Game does not follow the original fear at all.* Controls are.. awkward. The game tries to have contextual controls, but fails in it. For example I need own keys for shooting while on feet or in vehicle.* The game has this typical AAA-game feeling. There is just no depth to it. There is no love for this game.I'm not going to change my rating for this game. We wasted too much time on the problems and it left a bad taste in mouth.[Original]I'm going to give thumbs down, as I was really looking to play this as a coop/multiplayer game.Buy only for the single player experience. The coop and multiplayer modes disconnect frequently from the host or kicks clients, hosting or not. Tried with multiple hosts with each having an excellent internet connection speeds. All required ports open. With and without a firewall. It just does not work.A real shame. The game is interesting, controls are working, the game is responsive, but everything is ruined by frequent disconnect issue.			"

												F.3.A.R. An interesting concept gone completely horribly wrong. Following some what the events of F.E.A.R. 2 you can play as either the Point Man or Paxton Fettel, making for an interesting Co-Op experience compared to recent titles. The game play can be quite entertaining, however offering very little replay value. Also the story writing goes further down the trash bin, personally letting me down as I am a die hard fan of the original F.E.A.R. and admittedly enjoyed F.E.A.R. 2. However taking a thriller/shooter and casualizing the game play to CoD style truly took the games identity away. I have lost all hope of this game coming back to its original stature. Do NOT purchase this title, do not recommend. Also looking at the banners for each title should show how the quality was given up each title to where it stands today.			"

Either way you play, it is a lot of fun and creepy.			"

												Okay, I am going to get right into this and say that F.E.A.R. 3 is a BAD game, but it is only a BAD game to people who have played the other games. If you've played the other F.E.A.R. games, you understand why this game is the bane of our existance, but, if not, I shall explain it to you. Alright, F.E.A.R. and F.E.A.R. 2: Project origin were both made by the same company and in the same style. They had large maps that you could get lost in and unnerving environments. Monolith was NOT afraid to hit you with a scare that comes across as mild, though is nothing compaired to the rest of the game, but it get's you anyway, probably even more than the really big scares. It was the small things that kept people on edge for the duration of your play time. The characters were well thought out and they were in no way scared to be brutal. They slapped you with a psychic canibal clone commander from the start who blew through innocent men and woman to get to the people who tortured and killed his mother who was forced into carrying to children via clone fetus implant. Yeah... Pretty sick stuff. The Problem with F.E.A.R. 3, however, was, not only the fact that the developer who made it KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT HORROR, but also the fact that it was so pointless and soul-crushing that it totally went in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION of what the original creators wanted. Day 1 RUINED F.E.A.R. by turning it into a light, CHEAP, co-op, FPS hell. They almost entirely removed the horror aspect of the game and handed us one of the biggest loads of trash. The problems are as follows. 1. Going by the story line of the previous games, the ending was anti-climactic and a serious let down.2. The horror aspect it an attempt to use wierd sounds and over-cooked map textures to scare people as well as cheap jumpscares that would hardly startle a small infant.3. They changed the characters to a fault. The two biggest examples being the Characters Paxton Fettel and Point Man. Paxton had always been propper and rightfully creepy simply by the way he delivered his lines and their context. He now speaks in partial slang and comes across more annoying with his lines than his former eree. Point Man was originally personality-less, intended to be that way by the company that was implimenting his make-shift powers. They didn't want him to have a personality. This also helped the immersion of the game by allowing the player to impliment themselves onto the character. NOW, Point Man has a very angry and cliche silent-protagonist role, comming across as an overused-""badass"" steriotype. 4. CUTSCENES. The other games had little to no cutscenes. What few they had were all in first person and allowed the player some range of head movement. In F.E.A.R. 3, however, the cutscenes are full on thirdperson with no choice, no point, and do little to advance the story. If anything, they just annoy the player. (Paxton's cheesy jokes don't help any.) This also breaks the immersion charm that the F.E.A.R. games were known for. 5. The story is dead. Yes, they continue on from the last game involving Alma's third child, but hardly any of the game is even about that. You play a ""must save the princess"" sort of game with the Character Jin sun-qwan who can't seem to keep away from trouble, but was a total badass in the other games. She didn't need to be saved and was a good ally. In this game, she even has the gall to be annoyingly bossy, something I quite detest, especially seeing as her voice actor get's very ear-clenching after level two. They also make sure to kill off the Protagonist from F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin in an unessisarily brutal way and give him a voice, though he had none in his own game (Though I wonder HOW IN THE HELL THIS GAME GOT AHOLD OF ROBIN ATKIN DOWNS.) 6. They play Alma as a completely innocent little girl, running from the tyrant that was her father. Alma was, in no way, innocent. She was an evil, demonic spirit who killed many to get what she wanted and even mind♥♥♥♥♥♥♥her youngest son to get it, making HIM kill many people as well at age 10 and again at age 30. Another thing to note is that Harlon Wade did some bad things, but, as it is shown in F.E.A.R. 2, was reluctant to do said things to Alma, but did because he thought they were for the better. He certainly loved Alma, though she did kill him, and was clouded in judgement by those of the Armacham corperation. A spirirt such as his could not have come back as a demon, let a long one with so much power over the surviving family. 7. Inconsistantcy. Paxton's role in this game, on its own, is an inconsistancy. Not only is he a ghost, which he shouldn't be due to him gaining a new body off of a clone in the DLC for F.E.A.R. 2, Reborn, but he seems to like becoming visible and invisible to anyone but Point Man at any given time. What I mean by this is: During the cutscenes, the game shows that Paxton is totally invisible to anyone but his brother, but, in combat and totally BAD times, he is visible to the world and can be harmed by bullets, though in some scenes it is depicted that bullets have no effect on him, which leads no another problem when, in Point Man's ending, he stops Fettel by shooting him. I know what they were trying to do in paying  respect to the first game, but with the way they loused it all up, it just doesn't work. 8. (Finally) The endings. In Point Man's ending, he shoots Paxton in the head, delivers Alma's baby, then leaves with it. (I've already explained the two problems with this ending.) and In Paxton's ending, he possesses his brother, delivers the baby, then eats his own mother, claiming it'll give him the power to take over the world, which, isn't just cliche, but NEVER HIS GOAL IN THE FIRST PLACE. Paxton's goal was always to avenge his mother and serve her. Now he wants world domination. What in the... Never mind... I digress...ALSO, if you want a bonus: THE FINAL BOSS IS SO EASY THAT YOU'D HAVE TO BE BRAIN DEAD WITH YOUR NON-FUNCTIONAL BRAIN REMOVED NOT TO BEAT IT THE FIRST TIME ON THE HIGHEST DIFFICULTY. I swear, it is as obvious as a five-foot black spider on a white bedroom wall and as liniar as the lines on a road.It has bad shotguns, too. They are 50% glass. That isn't a safe thing.			"

												Great game, creepy - a ""good"" and a bad gf\uym both of which are playable in coop mode and have different endings. Fettel, the evil brother, can possess people, explode them from the inside out, and shoot aura like blast. The good brother is more straight action hero. Either way you play, it is a lot of fun and creepy.			"

												Okay, I am going to get right into this and say that F.E.A.R. 3 is a BAD game, but it is only a BAD game to people who have played the other games. If you've played the other F.E.A.R. games, you understand why this game is the bane of our existance, but, if not, I shall explain it to you. Alright, F.E.A.R. and F.E.A.R. 2: Project origin were both made by the same company and in the same style. They had large maps that you could get lost in and unnerving environments. Monolith was NOT afraid to hit you with a scare that comes across as mild, though is nothing compaired to the rest of the game, but it get's you anyway, probably even more than the really big scares. It was the small things that kept people on edge for the duration of your play time. The characters were well thought out and they were in no way scared to be brutal. They slapped you with a psychic canibal clone commander from the start who blew through innocent men and woman to get to the people who tortured and killed his mother who was forced into carrying to children via clone fetus implant. Yeah... Pretty sick stuff. The Problem with F.E.A.R. 3, however, was, not only the fact that the developer who made it KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT HORROR, but also the fact that it was so pointless and soul-crushing that it totally went in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION of what the original creators wanted. Day 1 RUINED F.E.A.R. by turning it into a light, CHEAP, co-op, FPS hell. They almost entirely removed the horror aspect of the game and handed us one of the biggest loads of trash.

[Edit]We managed to find solution to the coop issue. It seems that you and host needs to stay idle for a while in lobby and in beginning of the game in order to avoid being disconnected all of sudden. We spent 5 minutes talking at lobby and 5 minutes just standing at the beginning of a level. When we finally started to play, we managed to play several levels forward without any issues.Pros:* Coop was fun (when it works) and adds a lot to the game.* Possessing enemies were super fun. Friend in a bad spot? Posess an enemy from behind the enemy line and backstab everyone.Cons:* Scoring system sucks. Fettel will always lead in scores in normal game play (shared psychic links). Game endings are also tied to the score system. Should one of the brothers have more points than the other, it will cause good or bad ending.* The game is not scary. Game does not follow the original fear at all.* Controls are.. awkward. The game tries to have contextual controls, but fails in it. For example I need own keys for shooting while on feet or in vehicle.* The game has this typical AAA-game feeling. There is just no depth to it. There is no love for this game.I'm not going to change my rating for this game. We wasted too much time on the problems and it left a bad taste in mouth.[Original]I'm going to give thumbs down, as I was really looking to play this as a coop/multiplayer game.Buy only for the single player experience. The coop and multiplayer modes disconnect frequently from the host or kicks clients, hosting or not. Tried with multiple hosts with each having an excellent internet connection speeds. All required ports open. With and without a firewall. It just does not work.A real shame. The game is interesting, controls are working, the game is responsive, but everything is ruined by frequent disconnect issue.			"

But despite weak storyline, it's a surprisingly solid and satisfying shooter, which only gets better if played in co-op.100% Achievements 35-40 hoursYou will need a co-op partner for quite a lot of the achievements in this game.I also found that I needed a team of at least 3 to get Hanging 20 (Complete wave 20 in Contractions).

The gunplay was amazing everygun sounded the way it should. Descent challege and some badass guns. The graphics are descent colors are what you exspect from a horror shooter. This is not for you hardcore Survival horror shooters fans. Get the 1st fear or DOOM 3. The story is well.. Nothing really. It doesn't add much besides finishing off the series all be it a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way. The sound design is hit or miss with the voices of allies and monsters or what ever is shooting at you. I would wait to get this on sale unless you are a fan of the series. 7 out of 10 for fans 6 out of 10 for others			"

												As a fan of the first two FEAR games, I was pretty disappointed with how this game turned out. It gave up a lot of the interesting design of the first two for a rather bland, run-of-the-mill first person shooter experience. Levels were reduced to little more than straight corridors with things to hide behind and seemed to drag on longer than they should have as enemies filled choke points. Most of the guns felt uninspired compaired to guns from the first two and the weapon limit (brought over from 2, which was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ part of that game) didnt help at all. The worst part though is the wasted opportunity of a second playable character in the form of Paxton Fettel. So many more interesting gameplay mechanics could have been introduced in his powers, but we only got a stun blast attack and the ability to posses someone, which is basically just like playing as Point Man. I only really played this to see the conclusion of the story, which wasn't that great really, so I cant really recommend this on any level. (single player wise anyway, never tried the multiplayer).

Quick Bit- While having the most fully realized combat of the series and an interesting asymmetrical twist with the co-op gameplay, it falls extremely short due to the poor execution of the campaign with both co-op and solo, and the dead-on-arrival multiplayer.Extra Bit- I love this series, but thankfully the ire it wrought has long since become a dull ache, which allows me to convey a much more mellow expression for F.E.A.R. 3. It can be an enjoyable romp with a friend in co-op, and the odd, but ultimately interesting mechanics that makeup the dynamic brotherly duo of Point Man and Paxton Fettel can be oddly fun, even with the story being insultingly bad, and not enjoyed in an ironic way either.  The game still looks pretty decent, and the combat holds up solid, but of course you will literally need to bring a friend if you want to play co-op. The years have not been kind because like the multiplayer, co-op’s as dead as Alma is. Which is sad, because they did try, but not enough unfortunately to make it shine, and I don’t doubt WB had its gnarled claw in the mix as well. So the legacy ends with a thump, if not for F.E.A.R. Online making a final macabre display of the franchise, at least the name will be remembered for the superb enemy A.I.I will provide additional details, if requested for, in the comment section of the review.

But then when I saw the cover-lock system and how you can't jump over certain obstacles unless you use cover first... Well I got fed up with that trash pretty quickly. Then there's the fact that there's no real reason to try avoiding taking damage. Take as much as you like as often as you like, as long as you don't die you're all good cause it regenerates in a couple seconds.

												FEAR 3.... oh FEAR 3.... or as I like to call it ""Call of Duty: Spooky Warfare"". I know that it's usually not a good idea to write a review without finishing the game you're reviewing first but, I think we can make an exception for this 'game', for the record I got half way through. As with all the games in this series it combines (or atleast tries too) horror elements with actiony FPS elements. The horror elements in this game boil down to vague satanic references and zombies. The FPS elements is similar to the past games but the way it's done just doesn't feel like a FEAR game, except for one little tiny thing... regenerating health... I don't think I need to say anymore. The game still has slow motion like the past 2 games and is executed in much the same way. The Co-op system i wasn't able to test since noone I know has this game, can't really blame them, but I'm sure it's adequate. I don't know how the story to the FEAR trilogy ends, but I really don't care, the first game ended on a high note and I wish that's where the series ended aswell. Just a note the only reason I have this game is because it came with the WB Games humble bundle charity thing they did a few months prior to this writing, it came with the rest of the FEAR games along with the batman arkham games and some other stuff. Just please don't buy this game, if you want to play a FEAR game buy the first one it is, in my opinion and I'm sure many other, one of the best FPS games out there, this one being quite the opposite.

												The orginal FEAR was a horror masterpeice but unfortuantly F3AR is more like a generic FPS with monsters, a game that would have been unquie had it been released back in the mid 2000's (around 2002-2005). The story is really bad and the gameplay is nothing unquie while it obviosuly is trying to force you to play Co-Op over an actual single player gamel. It lacks the . One should think of it less as a FEAR game and more of a Resident Evil 5 knock-off (which was a ""horror"" game devloped for the Call of Duty audince) complte with a Co-Op feature that was shoehorned in.

												Every time I play a bad game it pains me to write an honest review, but this game nearly gave me an aneurysm by how bad it was. You cannot call this a FEAR game, and I refuse to believe that this is part of the FEAR franchise.- The gunplay was horrible.- The AI made a box of nails look sentient.- The visuals were worse than a game from 2007, and it might as well have been from 2007.- The weapon design offended my most basic human rights.- The sound design reminded me of a chalkboard being scratched.I might be speaking from my experience in singleplayer, but I wouldn't wish a co-op playthrough on anyone else. Not even as a joke. Do yourself a favor by avoiding this at all costs; unless you're really desperate to finish FEAR's story.			"

												The first question you have to assume is whether or not F.E.A.R 3 is better or worse than F.E.A.R 2. I really can't answer that because this game is just so... flagrant with it's mediocrity.F.E.A.R is a tragic series to me simply because of how it strayed so far from it's roots. The original was a great game with non-linear map design, great AI and a very noticeable influence from Hong Kong action movies and horror films. With this game... it just feels like the devs didn't care. Like they went into it knowing it was going to suck so they just went ""Eh ♥♥♥♥ it"" and designed it anyway.""Eh ♥♥♥♥ it"" seems to be a reaccuring philosophy with this game. It continues right from the end of the original game but is so stylistically different it's shocking. The Point Man now looks like a homeless Jesus figure (compared to the faceless balclava wearing professional of the original). At the same time they attempted to do more unique things like playing as your super natural brother Paxton Fettel, and the multiplayer has some unique game modes. But if the texture quality and 6 hour campaign don't put you off the mediocrity will. None of the new features feel like they need to be there. Bullet time is completely unnecessary because of the new cover mechanic, and the new cover mechanic is pointless because we already had bullet time. It's like a ♥♥♥♥ing Catch 22 and all I want is for this series to stop sucking.			"

												Thoroughly enjoyed instalments 1 & 2, I particularly enjoyed the atmosphere, relentless music and sound effects. I nearly made it past the dire opening prison level before giving up. I then re-started and gave it another chance based on a review that admitted the prison level was dire but that it got a lot better.  I made it into the slum area before asking myself the touchstone question: ""am I enjoying myself""? Answer was a big fat ""no"", and it all just felt like a chore. When a game feels like hard work it's time to cut your losses.It's worth saying that I only play single player mode. The shortfalls of the 3rd instalment have been documented comprehensively elsewhere, but for me the killers were:* Can't turn off head bob (= motion sickness)* Waves of quite hard-to-kill opponents. In FEAR 1 & 2, you knew you had 3 or 4 in each squad to tackle.* 2 weapons only* Pointless ""psychic links"". Why am I collecting these? For co-op I think.* Poor, blurry environments.I normally take ""save your money"" advice as a challenge and prefer to make my own mind up, but I think in this case : ""save your money"". "

												It's a fun co-op game, but not very scary. The audio is horrible in some parts, like nails on a chalkboard. Doesn't matter how low or high I have some of the audio settings, it's still bad on cutscenes. Had a horrible audio glitch where it sounded like someone shot a gun off next to my ear for a whole chapter. Other then that, a few graphical glitches and a dissapointing ending, the game is great for coop campaign players like myself.			"

The only reason this would worth playing is through the co-op campaign; play with a friend, point out how crummy the level designs are, how painfully unscary Alma is, how the story makes little to no sense and how this game even exists after a wonderful first installment.

For me is FEAR 3 scarier than FEAR 2 in some levels, but graphics is worse. Thank god that AI of enemies and game physics are still above averages games. Multiplayer is kind of original... sad is that there are no many players who are playing it...(you can always ask me!) xD			"

												I'm honestly surprised by how much I enjoyed this considering I'm a hardcore fan of the previous games. I would lie if I said it wasn't fun, alone or with a friend. This isn't what previous games in the franchise were, this isn't a horror game and it isn't as nearly as tactical as the previous games, but and this is a bit but, I had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of fun. If this game simply wasn't called FEAR I can assure you it would have been received with much more positive reviews.I grew up with FPS games like FEAR, Half Life, Doom, Quake etc., I love corridor-ish FPS games, I don't mind them being linear, sure it's nice when they have more open levels and more than one approach to a given situation, but I don't really mind linearity as long as the gameplay is good. I love running forward and shooting stuff in games, sure it would have been nice to a true successor to FEAR, but I'm not going to let my fanboism be in the way of me enjoying this.PROS*Fun gunplay*Great with friends*Bloody and gory as hell*Action feels satisfying*Not scary, but definitely atmospheric*Two characters to play, very different too*The whole campaign can be played in co-op and in addition there are some bonus game modes*Visually appealing and should run even on weaker systems*Contrary to what most people say I found the AI to be pretty alrightCONS*For the most part linear (doesn't bother me)*Not that scary*Story went to♥♥♥♥♥♥br>*CGI cutscenes are baaaaad*Voice acting is questionable*Can get repetitive if you play alone*The occasional invisible wallEDIT:*Ending is♥♥♥♥♥♥br>*Really anticlimactic final intervalI had fun guys, I love FPS games, I didn't mind what most people dislike and both me and my friend had a lot of fun, we plan on finishing this together. It is not a bad game, on the contrary, a lot of fun if you get over the fact it isn't a true FEAR game.			"

												Finishing off the FEAR trilogy!Every time I see FEAR 3 on sale I see people bashing it as the worst in the series, but the meta score is actually not too bad 74/100. Unlike the first 2 FEAR games, FEAR 3 has one of those regenerating health systems where you just hide under cover for a few seconds and you recover back to full health. No need to scrounge for med kits or armor. Also, the game seems built around 2 player co-op, which I like in first person shooter games (when I have someone to play with).*Spoilers ahead*FEAR 3 takes place an unspecified amount of time after the events of FEAR 2. Alma is pregnant and getting ready to give birth, as a result her psychic power is tearing up the city (possibly the world). Again the main opposition is the private military contractor Armacham, who seems to have become 100x more powerful than they were in the first games. Even without their clone super soldiers from the first games, Armacham seems capable of overrunning and occupying entire cities with soldiers, aircraft, and power armor. You play the Point Man protagonist from the first FEAR game (the guy you play in FEAR 2 also shows up briefly) but this time you have an “imaginary” friend Paxton Fettel (Bad guy from the first game). Your primary goal this time around is to reach Alma before she gives birth and deal with her once and for all. Unfortunately for you, Alma’s psychic pain has summoned nightmare creatures and twisted the surviving civilian population into crazed psychos.Unlike the previous FEAR games, FEAR 3 is broken down into missions or “levels” with each mission giving you a point score at the end. You gain points by finding collectables, killing enemies, and completing “challenges.” The challenges are similar to the “Skill shots” in Bulletstorm, where it’s basically just using various methods of killing. For example, 2000 points for killing enemies with a specific weapon, or 1000 points for getting 25 headshots, or 2000 points for getting 3 backstabs. The points aren’t just for show, by the way. You “level up” when you gain enough points and each level gives you some kind of perk, such as +10% health or +bullet capacity. You can replay levels as many times as you want to “grind” for points. This means that the game will get easier over time as you replay it. You might notice that when you first start the game, it seems far more difficult than the previous ones, well this changes as you level up and get stronger. The regenerating health means you can charge groups of enemies and just duck for cover when your screen is almost completely red (near death). Healing is free unlike FEAR 1 and 2 which had limited med kits.As I mentioned earlier, the game is built with 2 player co-op in mind. At the end of each mission there is a ranking between the 2 players to see who scored highest in several categories. The game’s ending depends on which of the two characters “won” the most missions. Of course if you’re playing single player the character you’re playing (Fettel or Point Man) will “win” every level you complete. Point Man’s gameplay is the same as the previous games (standard shooter with Slow-Mo power), But Fettel is a psychic commander. This means he can possess enemies and use them to fight (he doesn’t have slow-mo). Every time he takes over a new body he gets the weapons of the possessed enemy, so you can’t hoard powerful weapons or grenades the way Point Man does. You can only hold 2 weapons now, unlike 3 weapons in FEAR 1 and 4 weapons in FEAR 2. Possession also means you won’t be able to use the awesome power armors because the possessed body won’t last long enough. Pros:+Excellent graphics and visuals. Large variety of weapons available.+Some cool new enemies, particular the Phase Commander and Phase Caster.+A lot of replay value. I just finished the game and immediately restarted as Fettel. +2 player co-op available. Also a bunch of various multiplayer game modes I haven’t tried.Cons:-The game is very short, about 6 hours to beat the first time. Replay is strongly encouraged though.-The story is weaker than the first FEAR games. There’re a lot of unnecessary “dream sequences” that don’t seem to add much. You just walk forward about 15 seconds with someone talking in voice over and it ends.-I get the feeling that the enemies are much “dumber” than FEAR 1 enemies. They tend to stick behind the same piece of cover and just pop their heads out to shoot from there.Overall I think the game is well worth playing for fans of First Person Shooters and people who want to see how the FEAR story ends. Once you finish a mission in single player, the Fettel character is unlocked so you can try playing him for that particular level. The way to see the Fettel game ending is by playing through the game a second time (or play the game in co-op and Fettel has the highest score every mission). One thing I noticed is that the game’s Steam achievements seem to be half for multiplayer, and not many people are playing the multiplayer. This isn’t surprising since the game has been out for a few years. I’ll probably only be able to get about 45% completion for the game achievements by myself. "

People really complain about Fear 3 because it's apparently nothing like it's predecessors... in some way i have to agree, this game has less scary bits than the other fear games, especially fear 2. But there were still many parts in fear 3 that nearly made me crap my pants.And i know many people complain about how this game has no horror inside it...♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and all i have to say is that they should actually play the game in the middle of the night with headphones on.Pros:+amazing graphics+great fps mechanics+freaking slo-mo<---who the hell would dislike this in the game right?+really good story: explains many things i was confused about after finishing fear 2+many spooky bits+coop+really nice optimisation: i have an i3 2100, a gt 440(lol) and 4gb of ram and i can run this game 1680x1050p with all  medium settings without ambient occlusion or vertical sync and get from 40-55 fps.Cons:-the game is nearly as short as fear 2, i mean i finished the game in about 7.2 hrs without any rushing or anything. I                  found nearly all of the collectables and i've been wandering around in every corner/room that there is looking for some     something stuff.But overall, i rate this game 9/10 and recommend it to anyone who likes the combination of horror and fps			"

												While it fails to compare to the beautifully-crafted original, FEAR 3 is probably one of the most solid built shooters of this year. If you're looking for a game that'll treat you to a night of explosions, bloodshed and pretty-looking rifles, FEAR 3 should definately be considered your mate, especially if you've got a mate of your own to bring along with the cooperative experience it provides.Of course, I heartfully recommend trying out the first FEAR before you even think of touching this one. The original was a masterpiece of thrills and suspence second only to Half-life, and should be a part of your virtual or physical library if it isn't already.			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 is another great addition to the F.E.A.R. franchise that incorporates a co-op mode of gameplay. F.E.A.R. 3 uses similar mechanics from the original and its sequel, but still offers a fun adventure although with less emphasis on the story and a shorter campaign. However, you can play as either Point Man or Paxton Fettel in a single playthrough in the campaign - each with their own unique abilities. F.E.A.R. 3, basically, is a great game for acheivement hunters since many of them are fun and not too challenging.			"

												OK, to start, I haven't played the other F.E.A.R. games. If you are looking for a scare, this game probably isn't it, unless you use recommended brightness settings, and even then not so much until I think Interval 03. However, if you want a shooter that makes you feel like a badass, has a pretty interesting story, and has some of the sickest gameplay, this game is for you. Personally, I love the slo mo thing, you can feel like a badass, sprinting around a corner, going slomo, grabbing a shot gun and blasting peoples heads off. Oh, yeah, you can blow peoples heads off, so... definitely not for kids.			"

												Yes, is good. There's nothing really wrong with this game. It has funny gameplay and some good moments. The production values here are high as you can expect from the WB brand. I write this as a FEAR fan. I've played the whole FEAR 1 + exp. and FEAR 2 + dlc just before playing this one. And also yes, the story is weaker,  the locations doesn't make all the sense they should and the character of Alma is a side note. In return we get a more developed relationship between the brothers, although only the character of Fethel is developed as the Point Man is not very talkative, in one of the bad design desitions. You can expect this from another developer than Monolith. It's a shame they couldn't do this. FEAR was their saga. On a final note, if you liked the previous ones you will like this one, just don't start nitpicking. P.D.: The Mech level is awesome as always.			"

												Fettel was the original antagonist, and may have been a vampire.  He died at the end of FEAR, came back as a ghost in a non-canon expansion, and came back as a possessed Replica soldier in a FEAR 2 expansion.  In FEAR 3 Fettel is clearly a ghost and there are no Replica forces.  Go figure.  3/5  Fun for 2-player co-op if you catch it on sale.  For the single player, it's inferior to the first two and likely not worth your time.			"

												Ok. Let me start by saying I'm a HUGE fan of the first two games. They both bring something different to the table and they had all the atmosphere, scares, and visceral combat the franchise is known for. F3AR Is severly lacking the simplest way this is not a FEAR game. There is a new studio, a new engine - and entirely new writers. Let me start with some gameplay changes: The persistent weapon carry system is gone - there is now a 2 weapon limit that resets upon the start of each new chapter. Don't bother saving up and trading off a weapon for a fully filled rocket launcher unless you plan to use it, because It'll be gone at the end by the time the cutscenes come up. The health/armor system is gone and in place is a regenerating health system. This hurts the gameplay due to the fact that you can simply melee the majority of the jump mosters and sit healing before moving to the next trigger- it kills the adrenaline entirely. The classic replicant variants are gone in favor or new, completely arbitrary lore-breaking entities with poor voice acting and predictable movement. The classic FEAR A.I. is gone, and what they've implemented here is atrocious. Many times ""elite"" AI will sit in a single place ducking behind cover while I set up for the next headshot. The booster/reflex injector mechanic is gone in favor or hoping players will alter their play to ""score up"" and unlock the next level, which merely increases your grenade and slo-mo meter. The slo-mo is the weakest yet, and drains much too fast and takes obnoxiously long to refill... The problem with this is that the award/score system is fundamentally flawed with things like giving you points for fully draining your meter 3 times in a chapter. The game rewards you for time in cover, picking up ammo, finding pointless psychic links, picking up alma doll's (what?), getting headshots, consecutive kills without damage and so on. This would be all fine and dandy but the co-op quickly turns into PVP with the ending of the entire game dependant on who gets the highest score overall. The clever level design and setpieces of the first are instead shifted here with lackluster textured environments that are riddled with tacky cover points much similar to gears of war and other 3rd person titles. The cover system hardly needs to be utilized, as a crouch toggle behind cover works faster - BUT - it doesn't give you the score points for staying in cover X amount of seconds (what?). The linearity and uninspired level design pushes further by unrealistic structures with only a handful of recycled items scattered throughout - this kills the immersion entirely. The intel items from FEAR 1 and FEAR 2 are gone, and there is no extra easter-eggs or background text to dive into, its bare-bones aside from collectibles that increase your score. Every time you collect items, or complete challenges, you have a constantly annoying banner popping up telling you how much of a badass you are for getting 30 slo-mo kills, picking up ammo you would anyways, or doing anything you normally would in the flow of gameplay. Again, another immersion killer - but hey - we've gotten past that this game isn't the slightest bit scary. The game isn't even chilling, the highly-scripted scares are mostly FX and art based with no actual tension to worry about death. The mech combat returns from FEAR 2 with two different variations, but gone is the extra effects such as infared vision. The addition of other enemy types hardly brings anything to the background of the story with weird psycho's called occultists, and a constantly pestering psychic monster which is explained later in the game. The variety presented here makes no sense with the continuity of the franchise and it has nothing fresh to bring to the table. Most of the weapon variants return from previous games although poor - gone is the selective fire mode, so once you get the 3-burst rifle, your stuck with 3 burst. The ammo placements are laughable, with hidden area's having a single pistol on the ground when I'm loaded up with two rifles. This might be great, but with the 2 weapon limit, it kills the need to ever use lesser tiers of weapons, save for again - the award points. +25 kills with the pistol! woo!

												Ok. Let me start by saying I'm a HUGE fan of the first two games. They both bring something different to the table and they had all the atmosphere, scares, and visceral combat the franchise is known for. F3AR Is severly lacking the simplest way this is not a FEAR game. There is a new studio, a new engine - and entirely new writers. Let me start with some gameplay changes: The persistent weapon carry system is gone - there is now a 2 weapon limit that resets upon the start of each new chapter. Don't bother saving up and trading off a weapon for a fully filled rocket launcher unless you plan to use it, because It'll be gone at the end by the time the cutscenes come up. The health/armor system is gone and in place is a regenerating health system. This hurts the gameplay due to the fact that you can simply melee the majority of the jump mosters and sit healing before moving to the next trigger- it kills the adrenaline entirely. The classic replicant variants are gone in favor or new, completely arbitrary lore-breaking entities with poor voice acting and predictable movement. The classic FEAR A.I. is gone, and what they've implemented here is atrocious. Many times ""elite"" AI will sit in a single place ducking behind cover while I set up for the next headshot. The booster/reflex injector mechanic is gone in favor or hoping players will alter their play to ""score up"" and unlock the next level, which merely increases your grenade and slo-mo meter. The slo-mo is the weakest yet, and drains much too fast and takes obnoxiously long to refill... The problem with this is that the award/score system is fundamentally flawed with things like giving you points for fully draining your meter 3 times in a chapter. The game rewards you for time in cover, picking up ammo, finding pointless psychic links, picking up alma doll's (what?), getting headshots, consecutive kills without damage and so on. This would be all fine and dandy but the co-op quickly turns into PVP with the ending of the entire game dependant on who gets the highest score overall. The clever level design and setpieces of the first are instead shifted here with lackluster textured environments that are riddled with tacky cover points much similar to gears of war and other 3rd person titles. The cover system hardly needs to be utilized, as a crouch toggle behind cover works faster - BUT - it doesn't give you the score points for staying in cover X amount of seconds (what?). The linearity and uninspired level design pushes further by unrealistic structures with only a handful of recycled items scattered throughout - this kills the immersion entirely. The intel items from FEAR 1 and FEAR 2 are gone, and there is no extra easter-eggs or background text to dive into, its bare-bones aside from collectibles that increase your score. Every time you collect items, or complete challenges, you have a constantly annoying banner popping up telling you how much of a badass you are for getting 30 slo-mo kills, picking up ammo you would anyways, or doing anything you normally would in the flow of gameplay. Again, another immersion killer - but hey - we've gotten past that this game isn't the slightest bit scary. The game isn't even chilling, the highly-scripted scares are mostly FX and art based with no actual tension to worry about death. The mech combat returns from FEAR 2 with two different variations, but gone is the extra effects such as infared vision. The addition of other enemy types hardly brings anything to the background of the story with weird psycho's called occultists, and a constantly pestering psychic monster which is explained later in the game. The variety presented here makes no sense with the continuity of the franchise and it has nothing fresh to bring to the table. Most of the weapon variants return from previous games although poor - gone is the selective fire mode, so once you get the 3-burst rifle, your stuck with 3 burst. The ammo placements are laughable, with hidden area's having a single pistol on the ground when I'm loaded up with two rifles. This might be great, but with the 2 weapon limit, it kills the need to ever use lesser tiers of weapons, save for again - the award points. +25 kills with the pistol! woo!

												Just finished the third chapter.So far my opinion is: This is a fps, not a horror game. After the other FEAR games, this one disappoints me. There are horror elements, but they're lousy, not at all as immersive as the previous games.Maybe it gets better in the next chapters, but I don't think so.I bought this game with a discount and I plan to finish it.But it is not really, what I wanted to play.

												I'll say right off the bat that I am indeed a fan of the original F.E.A.R. game, I do not like the second one very much, and I think this third game is a complete atrocity. I promise I tried to make this review short, but there's just so much to say... Sorry. Let us begin.I shall also mention that, at the time of writing this review, I have completed the game twice - once as Fettel, once as the Pointman. I have not yet played the coop, although I'm sure it'll be a grand old time.Right off the bat, it is glaringly obvious that this game is intended to be cooperative. Is that a bad thing? Well, not inherently, coop shooters have been around for a very long time and there are a couple examples of cooperative horror done right. That is to say, it is still very scary indeed in spite the fact that you are not alone. However, given the fact that F.E.A.R. 3 doesn't deserve to be called a horror game - I'll get to that later - that's a rather moot point. So, you play as either the Point Man from the first game, or his brother Fettel. The Pointman obviously has bullet time, and Fettel the ability to possess enemies for a given time. I will say that the Pointman plays how you expect him to, no problems there, and Fettel is quite fun to play as well with what seems - to me, anyway - to be a rather well fleshed-out special ability. However, at the same time, it seems well balanced to the Pointman's and the enemies around. Although it would not surprise me if it is commonplace to fight to get Fettel over the Pointman.Getting back on topic, coop in itself is not an issue really, but I do believe that it was one of the big downfalls of this game. I shall elaborate at the end of this review.The second glaringly obvious addition which made me very upset when I first saw it was the inclusion of a per-level point system, complete with goals to earn you additional points which are snarkily or punnily named. Well, that's not very F.E.A.R.-like at all, now is it? Or horror-game like in general, really. Why, you ask? Well, in terms of U.I. and game mechanics, having a score system - let alone one with a little status menu you can look at in-game (by pressing F1) - kinda breaks the player's immersion. Maybe a post-mission stats screen would be okay, but having nothing at all - like in the last two F.E.A.R. games - would be a lot better. Hell, in the first game, immersion was one of the biggest things they were striving for! Hence the inclusion of such details like a full shadow for the player, good arm models, and the ability to look down and actually see your legs and feet. Same with the stigma the first game had about never taking control away from the player when possible. There were probably two cutscenes in the first game, and most of the times control is taken away from you is a few seconds after something whacked you on your butt and your person gets up, and even then it's almost nice as a breather between the action. This game, on the other hand, of course has that point-system, and cutscenes galore; the things bookending every single level.Although to be honest, immersion is a bit of a moot point with the lack of actual scares in the game...Let's get onto the horror elements, now. Or rather the lack-there-of. This game is not a horror game at all, it is a first-person shooter through and through. What makes me say that? Well, there are only four or five times in the entire game where it even tries to scare you or creep you out - and those times a very shortlived and ineffective. Going in fully blind, I didn't even get that sense of dread and not wanting to keep moving forward like I did in the first game. It did make me jump once in fear, although that was when I was walking through a seemingly empty house and an enemy - unintentionally - snuck up behind me and started yelling while clawing at me. T'was unexpected, but I don't think most people would even get scared by that - assuming they were playing it like one should an FPS; keeping their head on a swivel. There really just seemed like a lack of effort with the scares, to be honest. While I am sure they did try their best with the scary moments that are present, keep in mind there's literally four or five of them.Alright, so because this game is an FPS now, let's cover that next.The short version? It's your standard console shooter. What do I mean by that? Well, we now have regenerating health, a full cover system, a two-weapon carry limit, a very standard assortment of weapons outside of two which are even then not too interesting. You read that right, regenerating health in a F.E.A.R. game. A cover system, too, which I thought at first was kinda nice and was a change I'd be indifferent too. However, about midway through the game on my first run, I had a realization; the cover system was killing the pace of the combat. Hell, there's practically no need for the Pointman's bullet time given this. Just play it like you would Gears of War or similar and you're good to go. There's no panic or amazing action like in the first game, where there was no cover, and you had to be quick and clever to take out a whole squad. Though this was helped by a normal - or nowadays 'old school' - health system which, of course, gave you one-hundred points of health, and up to ten medkits which healed you a certain amount at the press of a button. Here, even if you try and replicate the amazing shootouts you remember from the original F.E.A.R. - and even the second game to a lesser extent - you're going to die, because the very nature of the regenerating health system doesn't allow such things. Even if you pull it off, you're just handicapping yourself really.However, then I had a thought. I stopped thinking about it as a F.E.A.R. game. Suddenly things got a lot better. This isn't a lazy, poorly made cash-in in my eyes, it was just made with the wrong license. If this game didn't have the F.E.A.R. title attatched to it, I would like it a hellofalot more. There was effort put in, and it is certainly fun to play at points, and at it's worst it's just like any other standard MMS (Modern Military Shooter), and I'm sure it'll be a blast when I get around to coop. It just shouldn't have been a F.E.A.R. game.While this is byfar the worst game in the F.E.A.R. franchise, but it's not a bad game on its own. Unless you count modern shooters bad, and I don't disagree with you if you do.			"

												The point at which F.E.A.R. stopped being a horror game (though I can't deny there's at least one Alma encounter that still made me jump).  It's basically a score-attack style pure FPS now, but it's a damn good one.  Co-op is pretty great too.			"

												I enjoyed the game, considering I was co-opping with my girlfriend and we enjoyed it in our own amusement and our own interesting struggles. We were surprised on how the storyline was short, which we wish there was a lot more to it. We liked the creativity of the Blue guys which were hard to kill, but we were also hoping that there was more demons instead of more men being spawned. Overal, it was a real good game, just wish it were longer.			"

												The internet convinced me this game would be terrible, a horrible abomination not even worth playing.Once again I am right and everyone else is stupid. In defense of these lesser minded opinions, this game is very unique in its series. You and an IRL friend engage in a six hour long campaign to outskill the other person. Bonuses are actively awarded for styling on enemies in a tremendous variety of methods. From backstabbing, headshots, using specific weapons, to killing without taking damage, the objective is to outdo your brother and become the ""favorite son."" Since the game was designed with 2p coop in mind, virtually all secondary item-finding exploration has been eliminated. This includes healthpacks and armor, which has been replaced with regenerating health. Even so the game presents a wide variety of environments and a ton of complex areas to go through.If you're playing this game by yourself you're really not doing it right. Grab a buddy and enjoy a pretty badass fps, laced with delicious FEAR-flavored sprinkles on top. Also the final boss is a giant instant-kill middle finger with attacks that are hard to predict and navigate around.			"

												If you are ever looking for an action packed spookfest, than this game is for you. FE3R reinvents the horror genre by adding a Co-Op mode so now you can experience the thrills and chills with your friends. The story is about two seperated brothers reuniting to win their mothers approval. The writing is deep and thoughful, and the scares are well executed and guaranteed to scare your pants off. The visionary movie director John Carpenter helped handcraft these cinematic frights. I would rate this game 4.5 spooky pumpkins out of 5 spooky pumpkins.			"

												Paxton Fettel: Be the other guy.This game is not really up to the standard of its predecessors, lacking as it does in spooky time, having weird pre-rendered cutscenes in which they mangle the overarching story, and generally completely losing the strangeness of the paranormal phenomena. They also call him 'pointman' with what amounts to a straight face. -_-'These considerable failings are mostly made up for by Paxton Fettel and coop mode, because you can play as or with a murderous, excessively powerful psychic ghost zombie thing who giggles like Beavis and Butthead every time he possesses someone and explodes heads all over the place. Coop mode was fun from both sides, although I think the Fettel experience really carries this game.			"

												I must say I was extremely surprised by F.E.A.R. 3. Anyone who says this is not a proper Fear game has no idea what he's talking about. Yes, it is not scary at all, but to be honest: I never found the other ones scary either. They all (including the add-ons) had a VERY intense and dark atmosphere, but they weren't really scary. F.E.A.R. 3 does a great job at the gory, slow-mo shooting mechanics and the story is entertaining, however still largely nonsensical, but that is exactly how this series has always been: Great action, intense atmosphere, tons of blood and a completely ♥♥♥♥ed up mess of a story.

During gameplay you also have challenges which stop you from the run-n-gun which was a big part in the previous F.E.A.R. and makes you try out a different approach. Also they added a ""take cover"" option allowing you to duck behind walls and boxes other than just standing behind them.Great game and would recommend playing from the beginning.:Edit:After Playing the game as the ""Bad brother"" (fettel) a Strong Con of the game was that the Script was not changed, the same lines are said when you played as the ""Good brother"" and therefore some scenes didn't make sense.

												It's sad to see the F.E.A.R. series come to this. This game is suffering from consolitis, chest-high walls, popamole combat and flat storyline and characters. 4 hours into the game and I don't know if I even want to finish it. The only reason I even played this to begin with, is that the game supposedly has something to do with the other FEAR games. But you wouldn't know that from playing the game itself.  FEAR 2 already took some steps back, compared to the original game, but it was still an enjoyable game. Not great, but enjoyable.                FEAR 3 is barely recognisable as a FEAR game: Popamole combat, bland cutscenes and no atmosphere. You sit behind  chest-high walls and defeat enemy waves. Other times you watch bland cut-scenes or go through some uninspiring  flashbacks. I propably should mention the jump scares as well; They come off as desperate attempt to catch even a glimpse of the atmosphere of the previous games.            In the previous games you always felt somewhat sad for Alma's predicament and what had been done to her. That's a sign of good writing and it gave the games a great atmosphere. All that is gone in this 3rd instalment. First F.E.A.R. was a classic. It added bullet-time and horror elements to an fps game. It had good writing, aggressive combat and great A.I. It was an ambitious game. F.E.A.R. 3 on the other hand is mediocre in every respect. It's a mediocre Call of Duty game with some ""horror"" sprinkled on top of it.  The horror effects only remind the gamer, of the better F.E.A.R. games. ""Oh hey! I remember that better FEAR game that was actually good. Maybe I should play that instead.""5,5/10			"

The best thing about this is the Co-op play. You can play the whole game with a friend and it makes it so much more fun :D. One person is the main character, and the other is his dead spirit brother who can take possession of bodies and fight along side them. More companies should make this kind of co-op!! :D			"

												Definately a Fear game with a twist.  Think of Previous Fear  releases, then think power, think betrayal, think revenge, think Oh am I whats Scary now.  Listen anyone on my list likes what I like and or has similar Beefs with games on the line.  Buy this because I said so.  You won't be betrayed.  Strong online Co-Op up to challlenge to!!			"

												Paxton Fettel: Be the other guy.This game is not really up to the standard of its predecessors, lacking as it does in spooky time, having weird pre-rendered cutscenes in which they mangle the overarching story, and generally completely losing the strangeness of the paranormal phenomena. They also call him 'pointman' with what amounts to a straight face. -_-'These considerable failings are mostly made up for by Paxton Fettel and coop mode, because you can play as or with a murderous, excessively powerful psychic ghost zombie thing who giggles like Beavis and Butthead every time he possesses someone and explodes heads all over the place. Coop mode was fun from both sides, although I think the Fettel experience really carries this game.			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 is interesting to say the least. I will say that it is a good game, as I spent quite a lot of time on the multiplayer, but it's not a good F.E.A.R. game. It doesn't feel anything like F.E.A.R or F.E.A.R. 2 did and isn't scary in the slightest. However, if you can gather some friends to play the multiplayer with you, you will have a blast of a time. The co-op isn't bad either if you look past the abysmal story, and I found that it was actually worth playing through the entire thing again as Fettel because of how new and fresh he plays.If you're looking for a true sequel to F.E.A.R and F.E.A.R 2, this isn't it. If you're looking for a shooter experience that you will most likely enjoy, then this is something you should consider buying.I had fun.			"

												The original F.E.A.R. is one of my favorite Horror games of all time, and certainly on my top ten favorite FPS games ever. It delivered a sense of Horror and realism with graphics that excelled all possible thought during its initial release, and it was a while before we saw another Horror game deliver the same intensity and excitement F.E.A.R. did. Fast-forward a few years later, and we see the release of F.E.A.R. 2, a title that had promise in expanding the universe and story of Alma, but fell a little short when it came to delivering a captivating experience. Though not bad by any means, it certainly didn't live up to what the first F.E.A.R. had accomplished.And then there was the end to the trilogy, after an unecessary amount of ports and random spinoffs. This... this supposedly Horror game that has the word F.E.A.R. in the title, albeit as an acronym, is the biggest form of false advertisement I've seen in a while. It's like going to a pizzeria, and they have nothing to do with pizza. You're gonna tell me you're just going to say ""ƒuck it"" to the pizza when you know damn well you've been wanting pizza for the last couple of hours? One does not simply say ""ƒuck it"" to the pizza. Same thing here - I want my horror, and I got none of it. Where is the *FEAR* I'm supposed to be feeling? Where is the *FEAR* that the other two games exuded?F.E.A.R. 3 succumbed to the issue most banal FPS games have, which is waves of enemies, walk five feet, more waves of enemies, walk maybe ten feet this time just to make it seem like some actual ludology went into the design of the game, a couple lights flicker to remind you ""oh I remember this from the other F.E.A.R. games! That means I'm playing F.E.A.R. - I almost forgot!"", even though it doesn't mean sh!t, and then rinse and repeat. The story makes absolutely no sense and goes in an unecessary direction that's full of sh!t. That's the best way I can honestly put it - It's full of sh!t. Monolith had a genuinely good thing going and created a masterpiece from the first one, and a decent enough sequel to it, but whatever happened to this one once it changed studios... I just don't know. They clearly wanted to make a different game, but remembered that they were working on a game that already had a few entries before it. Basically ƒuck F.E.A.R. 3			"

												And alas we come full circle with the F.E.A.R series with F.E.A.R 3 or F.3.A.R if you're a fan of bad names. F.E.A.R 3 contructs its campaign to be a co-op based afair compared to the other games in the series, so it's best you play it with a buddy as I did. Gameplay remains much the same if you play as Pointman complete with slo-mo gunfighting and all. Fettell on the other hand is the more interesting character to play as he has some neat abilities like possession and suspending enemies. Story is pretty bare bones even for a F.E.A.R game with no really interesting character interactions except the dialogue between the brothers occasionally. The biggest flaw however is that the game is criminally short, like 4 hours total to beat all 8 intervals. Also the horror has taken a further backseat with the introduction of co-op. Overall whilst F.E.A.R 3 isn't a bad game, it's actually a fun co-op game to play with a friend, it's a bad F.E.A.R game compared to the others in the series.			"

												Although the storyline was disappointing (from a long-time F.E.A.R. fan's perspective) and the actual game only took about 6 hours to complete, F.3.A.R. is still a generally enjoyable game. The singleplayer seems to focus more on its action persona than its horror aspect, which was sad to see since the original game had an extremely frightening and terrifying atmosphere. The action is as you'd expect it to be - fast-paced, tight and fun, especially when you activate your slow-mo ability. Plus Co-Op is great with a friend. The multiplayer of the game is a pleasant surprise. Modes like ""Contractions"" (where you must survive against an endless wave of enemies) and ""F**king Run"" (a Left 4 Dead style gamemode where you must travel from one side of the map to the end, running from a giant wall of death) are extremely fun and require you to cooperate with your teammates to survive. If you don't, you won't last very long.A solid shooter that just doesn't live up to the original game.7/10			"

												Игра вполне хорошая, но это не F.E.A.R. Я ждал больше хорор моментов, неожиданных поворотов и более глубокий сюжет, который смог бы залатать дыры прошлых частей. На деле получилась игра с отличным экшеном(что для меня было на втором плане) но с наитупейшим сюжетом. Да и не то что бы сюжет тупой..просто он топчется на одном месте. Образ поинтмена мне вообще не понравился. Из солдата элитного подразделения феар, он превратился в бомжа. Этот образ ну никак не подходит. И что само бесит - галимый хорор и отсутствие неожиданных сюжетных поворотов. Напугать у разработчиков не получается. Да и эффекты присутсвия Альмы вообще испорчены. Во второй части от каждого появления бегали мурашки по коже.Разработчики в самом начале поставили не те задачи. Идея превратить FEAR в кооп шутер уже сразу не увенчался успехом. Вердикт - отличный экшн, слоумоу пыш пыш, но сюжет просто калл. И когда будите принимать решение о покупке игры, подумайте за что вы полюбили прошлые части феар. За сюжет, хорор, или же экшн. P.S. Я очень хочу увидеть 4ю часть, но что бы в разработчиках значился Monolith. Понятия не имею как можно залатать этот сюжетный бред после 3й части, но в их способностях я уверен. "

												It's sad to see the F.E.A.R. series come to this. This game is suffering from consolitis, chest-high walls, popamole combat and flat storyline and characters. 4 hours into the game and I don't know if I even want to finish it. The only reason I even played this to begin with, is that the game supposedly has something to do with the other FEAR games. But you wouldn't know that from playing the game itself.  FEAR 2 already took some steps back, compared to the original game, but it was still an enjoyable game. Not great, but enjoyable.                FEAR 3 is barely recognisable as a FEAR game: Popamole combat, bland cutscenes and no atmosphere. You sit behind  chest-high walls and defeat enemy waves. Other times you watch bland cut-scenes or go through some uninspiring  flashbacks. I propably should mention the jump scares as well; They come off as desperate attempt to catch even a glimpse of the atmosphere of the previous games.            In the previous games you always felt somewhat sad for Alma's predicament and what had been done to her. That's a sign of good writing and it gave the games a great atmosphere. All that is gone in this 3rd instalment. First F.E.A.R. was a classic. It added bullet-time and horror elements to an fps game. It had good writing, aggressive combat and great A.I. It was an ambitious game. F.E.A.R. 3 on the other hand is mediocre in every respect. It's a mediocre Call of Duty game with some ""horror"" sprinkled on top of it.  The horror effects only remind the gamer, of the better F.E.A.R. games. ""Oh hey! I remember that better FEAR game that was actually good. Maybe I should play that instead.""5,5/10			"

												The final entry in the F.E.A.R. franchise as of this writing, F.E.A.R. 3 provides a much better story than that of F.E.A.R. 2 (which could fit on a post-it and was generally non-existant and boring), better visuals, better performance and much better gameplay. Is it better than F.E.A.R. 1? No, but it's a lot of fun in single player (I don't play co-op) and offers a campaign both as Point Man and Fettel, with the Point Man being the protagnist of the first game and Fettel being a ghost, offering interesting dynamics. The shooting is fast and fluid and the bullet-time mechanics the franchise is known far work beautifully in a series of shootouts involving soldiers and mechs providing a varied challenge. The addition of stick to cover mechanics isn't distracting. Although the shooting takes place mostly in tightly scripted sequences of areas with the occasional signposting problem where you need to look around to figure out where to go next, the steady clip of the action punctuated by good cutscenes maintains a solid pace throughout. A satisfying conclusion to the series that redeems the pathetic F.E.A.R. 2 and although I'd have liked more of the super intelligent AI of F.E.A.R. 1, this'll do.			"

Where is the *FEAR* that the other two games exuded?F.E.A.R. 3 succumbed to the issue most banal FPS games have, which is waves of enemies, walk five feet, more waves of enemies, walk maybe ten feet this time just to make it seem like some actual ludology went into the design of the game, a couple lights flicker to remind you ""oh I remember this from the other F.E.A.R. games! That means I'm playing F.E.A.R. - I almost forgot!"", even though it doesn't mean sh!t, and then rinse and repeat. The story makes absolutely no sense and goes in an unecessary direction that's full of sh!t. That's the best way I can honestly put it - It's full of sh!t. Monolith had a genuinely good thing going and created a masterpiece from the first one, and a decent enough sequel to it, but whatever happened to this one once it changed studios... I just don't know. They clearly wanted to make a different game, but remembered that they were working on a game that already had a few entries before it. Basically ƒuck F.E.A.R. 3			"

												You can jumpkick people in the face, in real time and in bullet time.You can also slidekick people in realtime and in bullet time.Both are hilarious!Story is kind of interesting, if not a little weird.Shooting works, has regenerating health, which is kind of a shame.And the game just is not scary.Worth the $5 sale, maybe not full price.

												The final entry in the F.E.A.R. franchise as of this writing, F.E.A.R. 3 provides a much better story than that of F.E.A.R. 2 (which could fit on a post-it and was generally non-existant and boring), better visuals, better performance and much better gameplay. Is it better than F.E.A.R. 1? No, but it's a lot of fun in single player (I don't play co-op) and offers a campaign both as Point Man and Fettel, with the Point Man being the protagnist of the first game and Fettel being a ghost, offering interesting dynamics. The shooting is fast and fluid and the bullet-time mechanics the franchise is known far work beautifully in a series of shootouts involving soldiers and mechs providing a varied challenge. The addition of stick to cover mechanics isn't distracting. Although the shooting takes place mostly in tightly scripted sequences of areas with the occasional signposting problem where you need to look around to figure out where to go next, the steady clip of the action punctuated by good cutscenes maintains a solid pace throughout. A satisfying conclusion to the series that redeems the pathetic F.E.A.R. 2 and although I'd have liked more of the super intelligent AI of F.E.A.R. 1, this'll do.			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 is interesting to say the least. I will say that it is a good game, as I spent quite a lot of time on the multiplayer, but it's not a good F.E.A.R. game. It doesn't feel anything like F.E.A.R or F.E.A.R. 2 did and isn't scary in the slightest. However, if you can gather some friends to play the multiplayer with you, you will have a blast of a time. The co-op isn't bad either if you look past the abysmal story, and I found that it was actually worth playing through the entire thing again as Fettel because of how new and fresh he plays.If you're looking for a true sequel to F.E.A.R and F.E.A.R 2, this isn't it. If you're looking for a shooter experience that you will most likely enjoy, then this is something you should consider buying.I had fun.			"

												This game is actually creepy and actually scary in a startling way, it would be funny to invite your big tough friends over and watch them jump and scream like little girls while you play it. Maybe once I get my new speakers i'll do just that, that will be priceless.The game itself is pretty straight forward, you go from level to level and kill all the bad guys, each level has different types of bad guys sometimes there are soldiers and sometimes there are psychos with bombs strapped to their bodies and other ones who throw knives at you.I think for an older game they did really well putting it together, I've never really played a game that was so creepy before, once through the game though I think it will lose its appeal. There is coop and multiplayer which I haven't tried yet, so I can't comment on those things at this time.			"

I was kinda entertained by the storyline, but this wasn't a scary game at all. I was really disappointed with the lack of scare involved.That being sad, it's really not a terrible game. It's nice in co-op and it was rather entertaining. I probably wouldn't have been so entertained with singleplayer then again I am more of a co-op game.

												Mit F.E.A.R. 3 oder auch F.3.A.R. kam ein Spiel auf den Markt, an das hohe Erwartungen gestellt wurden - leider blieben diese völlig unerfüllt. Die Spieleserie wurde zu einem reinen Shooter heruntergewirtschaftet und der eingebaute ""Horror"" ist eine blanke Lächerlichkeit. Zu allem Überfluss lässt die Story zu wünschen übrig und die beiden Endings, die man erhalten kann, lassen mehr Fragen offen, als beantwortet werden.Wenn man ein Shooter-Liebhaber ist und gerne lineare Storylines ohne mehr als Herumgeballere spielt und auch glaubt, dass Horror nur aus Blut und Explosionen von Menschen besteht, wenn man ein Achievementhunter ist und auf Scores achtet, dem würde ich es zweifelsohne empfehlen. Wenn euch jedoch die F.E.A.R.-Reihe am Herzen liegt: kauft euch F.E.A.R. 3 nicht. Mehr als schießen und durch die Level rushen findet ihr da leider nicht mehr.			"

												I AM ONLY RECOMMENDING THIS IF YOU HAVE A CO-OP PARTNER!This game is a giant step down from FEAR 1 and FEAR 2.It makes me think that the studio fired everyone fromthose games, then hired away bunch of the best people from other studios who assisted on other top FPSs, but forgot the most important parts: a game designer, a lead writer and voice talent.So, the graphics are good, AI is still quite good, pacing is quite good, and environments are interesting. But they all also feel very GENERIC.The voices are bad, especially Alma's voice. Her only ""line"" is screaming, but it sounds like some random girl they pulled off the street. It stands out badly and wrecks the experience whenever it happens.The dialogue is terrible, and while the other games in the series' stories were nothing to write home about, this one's plotjust plain stupid and incoherent. Literally every chapter ends with the hero falling down a hole or having his vehicle exploded, which conveniently means that each level starts with him having lost all of his weapons in the previous level. THIS IS BAD DESIGN.Design-wise, the first 2 games were great in that lighting, sound cues and level design always had you looking and moving in the right direction. This one seems to have sound cues, but they're just parts of the soundtrack, so a little spooky chime that would have coincided with a crawling enemies scurrying past is just meaningless in this game. I found myself just plain missing some of the intended jump stares because I was turned in the wrong direction in this game, while that never happened in the other games. This game frequently resorts to graffitti arrows to guide you from arena-type area to arena-type area. Needing to do that should be a sign for developers that their game design SUCKS.They totally removed the great sound design and cues from the first 2 games and replaced it with a run-of-the-mill, looping soundtrack that doesn't match ingame dynamics closely enough.They also went with a rechargeable health mechanic that I don't think is as good for this series as the first aid kit model that all of the other games had. FEAR1 and 2 basically just made sure you were stocked up on health after every battle, which is just as unrealistic as the Halo model, but made each battle feel like a self-contained test of skill. Switching that model makes the basic feel of this game just feel out of character, and you can frequently just go hide behind a crate in the corner and recharge ad nauseum.Also, the bullet time mechanic gets drained MUCH faster than in the other games and recharges much more slowly. I found myself in bullet time around 50% of the time in FEAR2 but only about 20% of the time here. Instead, all of the typical enemies are much less balanced to the character than before. In the other games, it was almost impossible to get through most encounters without bullet time because of that balance, but here, you only really need it during boss fights. Again, it really doesn't feel like a FEAR game as a reult.They added a cover system that I basically never used, because you stay in 1st person perspective staring at the wall when you're in cover, which makes it a huge tactical disadvantage.One of the most stupid things they added is an experience point system that affects how long you can bullet time and how many extra ammo clips you can carry. You get experience points via a series of way-too-gamey ""achievements"". What that means is that to get the most experience, you have to stop using a weapon after getting 10-25 kills with it, because each weapon only has one level of achievement. So, instead of using the best weapon available, you're forced to drop a good weapon after you've met its ""quota"" if you want to maximize your bullet time. This is STUPID. Even more stupid is achievements for using bullet time and cover that mean you'll want to start each level by sitting in cover for 200 seconds and use 5 minutes each level draining and recharging bullet time from max to empty a bunch of times to get those achievements. It's a design decision that breaks the flow of the game and rewards playing out of character. THIS IS IMMERSION BREAKING.CO-OP is VERY FUN in this game, despite all of the problems. Gunplay is quite nice and reminiscent of Homefront, CoD, etc.The game is really designed to be played in CO-OP and it's disappointing that there's no AI ""brother"" companion during single-player. Him not being there during the shooting doesn't make sense in terms of the (badly written) story.All in all, there's no reason to play this game unless you're:1. Playing it CO-OP2. Are out of other FPS's to playPlease note that the FEAR1 DLC's stories have been retconned out of this game, so it's not even really worth playing if you somehow feel invested in the trilogy's story enough to need to see the ending.

												FEAR has been apart of my life since it first came out. Hearing the whispers of Alma and having her appear again and again eviscerating and tearing apart anyone in her way. While FEAR 3 is not the favorite among many players...it does keep up with the story along with shocking conclusions and revelations. The game runs great honestly...while lacking in color. I run at 4096*2160 resolution and had Reshade and an ENB in my game for the best visuals.The combat was great, you can take cover, be tactical or use slow mo and take out five men in three seconds.While there was an obvious lack of jump scares as compared to the first game and its add-ons, the overall atmosphere, gore, ideas and thought in the level detail kind of makes up for it.I wish Alma could have been more of a main character in this game, even speaking more to the players as a source of background.Overall it is a great game and a great series. I give it an 8.5/10 since I wish there was more jump scares. I hope there is a fourth game as well!			"

												Here's the deal, F.E.A.R. 3 is nothing like the other two entires. Remotely. It is a Call-of-Dutified entry to the series which has its fair share of ""F.E.A.R. moments"", though at a caveat, being delivered with a horribly inconsistent difficulty and a tedious combat system. As far as its story goes, it is passable, with none of the bells and whistles of the original two games with their expansive ""voicemail messages"" (F.E.A.R.) and ""intel documents"" (F.E.A.R. 2). Ending = crap. Also to be noted is the increasingly nauseating gore-factor, which is not for the weak of heart (or stomach). The graphics are pretty average, the sound effects atmospheric, though interrupted consistently by the in-game achievements (terribly, terribly integrated). That's right, the constantly popping achievements (in-game, not Steam) are one of my greatest gripes, as it really draws from the experience, as you could imagine, though thankfuly, this is not too much of an experience to be missed.6/10			"

As far as its story goes, it is passable, with none of the bells and whistles of the original two games with their expansive ""voicemail messages"" (F.E.A.R.) and ""intel documents"" (F.E.A.R. 2). Ending = crap. Also to be noted is the increasingly nauseating gore-factor, which is not for the weak of heart (or stomach). The graphics are pretty average, the sound effects atmospheric, though interrupted consistently by the in-game achievements (terribly, terribly integrated). That's right, the constantly popping achievements (in-game, not Steam) are one of my greatest gripes, as it really draws from the experience, as you could imagine, though thankfuly, this is not too much of an experience to be missed.6/10			"

Games to understand the story of the characters more. also F.E.A.R. 1 the beginning is awsome, all of them are, you will love it.			"

We could also remove what made the orginal game unique by making it play more like shooter, like that COD the kids love so much!""I imagine this is what a conversation between the creators of fear 3 would be like.That being said, it really isn't an awful game, just an awful F.E.A.R. game.

												As everyone knows F.E.A.R. is the best game in the series, but the bad rep that F.E.A.R. 3 gets is unfair. As a stand alone game it's very well done, I enjoyed every second of it. It made huge improvements on the damage done to the series by the second game, and the story was captivating. This game may not be right for a long-time F.E.A.R. fan but for anyone who can put their fanboy feelings aside long enough to actually enjoy the game, it's well worth it.			"

												Co-op makes the game at least playable, Only downside is that you need to have good reflexes to catch most of the jump scares, which adds a whole layer of tactical gameplay were you have to coordinate with your teammate when and where a jump scare might occur so you don't miss it.

												[Serious]So let me just say, I have beaten this game twice. Once by myself, and a second time with a friend. This game is, plain and simple, fun. It fails to deliver as a third installment to the ""F.E.A.R."" series (not counting expansions). The story is bland, but picks up after the 1st/2nd game. But the leveling system in the campaign, the ""slow-mo"" effect you love to use, and overall combat, is just stupid FPS fun. The game is also short, so while at risk for being reptitive, it can be beaten in 1 sitting. Play this game with a friend if you can, and you're sure to have a good time. The diversity of game mechanics between the brothers, while not completely different, is a nice attempt to see. One brother can slow down time, while the other can possess enemies. Personally, I say get it on sale, and you shouldn't be regretting your purchase. It's just too bad it went more action, over the ""F.E.A.R."" we were given from the first.Also, this game doesn't give a fug. Some of the things that happen in the story, is just ridiculous. I'M FED UP WITH THIS WUUURRRRLLLLDDD!!!!!!!			"

												Now this, is a co-op oriented kind of game, it truly is. Almost every bit of the game was made for you and you friend(s). There's 5 gamemodes total. First, the co-op campaign of course, the main dish. And then you got the Contractions mode, which is basically a survival mode, with tons of enemies, several boss fights, while you got the EPA to fight back. There's also a Soul King mode, in another words, is your turn to play the scary ghost to hunt AIs down. All you need to do is possess and kill, yeah including your friends, remember they're playing ghosts as well. Next one, the Soul Survivor mode, I'd say this is a co-op survival mode combined with zombie infection and PvP. You, or one of your friends would be chosen to become spectre randomly, his or her mission is to take the friends down and corrupt them, to make them become spectres, while you guys are fighting the AI. Finally, the Fahking Run mode, just run, and don't look behind. Help your teammates, don't let him or her get caught by that massive WALL OF DEATH which crossovered from Mummy the film.In conclusion, this game is totally worth the price. There's a leveling system, you can earn the exp by accomplishing the goals, and in each level, you'll get various reward, such as Slow-Mo duration increased etc.. And almost all of the gamemodes can be play in your own, nevertheless if it's a multiplayer mode.HOWEVER, there's still two downsides. FIRST, there is no fahking in-game chat, yes, there's none, you gotta chat with your mates via steam while you're shooting the replica soldiers, and let me tell you, it is one pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥indeed, and keep in mind, all 5 modes within the game are co-op, too. SECOND, although the co-op campaign is the main dish, it is still too short, which is sad. I beat this game for like 6 hours, and there's only 8 intervals, and the final one got nothing to shoot at, except for the final boss fight.Now if you can take those downsides, just go ahead and buy it then.

												I really wanted to like this game. I was a big fan of the first two in the series and was looking forward to an epic apocalyptic conclusion. This game dropped the ball on so many levels. It turned a FPS with an interesting story into just a straight FPS and threw the story away. I did enjoy playing as Fettel, but that was all. Alma was hardly threatening, Sgt Beckett died a pointless death, and the stupid Alma cultists....don't get me started. The graphics were on par with F.E.A.R. 2. I have heard that this game is fun on multiplayer, but I don't buy a game just for a multiplayer option. I buy and play for a story. Fear had it all: action and story!....until now.			"

												If you're looking at buying this game because you loved the previous games, don't.  It's got very little in common with them except the plot.  It's got none of the atmosphere that the previus games had.  There is no fear.  I am not saying the previous games were all that scary, but they had the genuinely spooky quality to them, F.E.A.R. 3 doesn't.  It really tries to show that it's a F.E.A.R. game, but all the blood and gore in the world won't bring back that feeling you got when you first heard Alma laugh right behind you and when you turn all you see the mere flicker of a shadow run past your periphery.They took everything that made the first games unique and awesome and made this another COD clone.  They replaced armor and health packs with regenerating health.  They limit your ammo supply, but leave lots of it lying around to pick up.  The SloMo drains too fast and isn't fun to use anymore.  There is no resource management, just run and gun.  The nerf to the SloMo combined with pre-positioned enemies takes all the fun away from anticipating where the enemy is coming from, using SloMo to catch them early and gunning down three to four enemies before they can react properly like the badass you're supposed to be.I am not saying the games sucks, it's just not I wanted or expected.

Nice graphic and slo-mo effects. Mechs are damn cool, but a bit over-powered.However, public lobby is non-existence, neither coop nor MP. So ONLY get this game if you got friends to play with (or if you're a hardcore FEAR fans).My score: 8/10			"

												What is F.E.A.R. 3?--F.E.A.R. 3 is a twisted sequel to the F.E.A.R. series of psychic-horror first person shooter games. F.E.A.R. 3, however, is more of a co-op arcade cover based FPS with some very light psychic-horror elements.----Who would most enjoy F.E.A.R. 3?--If you're looking for a fast-pased co-op FPS, with a darker twist, F.E.A.R. 3 may be an enjoyable pick-up. The game fails to deliver the ambient terror and jump-scares of the previous title, and has a far weaker delivery of plot than its predecessors. That being said, it can make for an entertaining competative co-op experience, and provides a substantial amount of replay value, if that's what you're looking for.----Over-all: 62.5%F.E.A.R. falls short in a lot of areas where the previous titles excelled, providing a weaker experience over-all. The game provides more replayability than any of the previous titles, but with that said, I'm not convinced that this is a good thing, on it's own, as the core gaming experience just isn't enjoyable enough to replay.--Mechanics: 3/5The mechanical flow of F.E.A.R. 3 is inferior to it's predecessor, F.E.A.R. 2. The AI is slightly less interesting, and largely more annoying to play against, the movement and cover system is functional, but not exactly fluid, as are the weapons. On top of this, the bullet-time (core mechanic) feels less fluid and less functional than in previous games.--Experience: 2/5The textures of F.E.A.R. 3 have been updated, but the stylization was a serious turn-off for me. The game felt visually cheap, arcadey, and generally far from immursive. The audio fell short in all regards as well, providing much less emphasis towards the atmosphere than in previous titles, and in places, distracting from the atmosphere (enemy AI call-outs). Balance: 3/5Some weapons clearly out-class others, and are just as accessible, and the bullet-time mechanic seems to have been gutted to a degree. This aside, the game is decently balanced, and rarely overly frustrating, but the general balance is anything but remarkable.--Longevity: 4.5/5If you can get past the short-comings of the game, it does provide a lot of content. There's a level-up system, two different viewpoints to play the campaign from, and a fairly decent co-op mechanic. Beyond that, there's a competative element, using an elaborate point system, and for the speed runners out there, a tracker for completion time.			"

												I have played this all the way through, although with more than a fair dose of disappointment, from the outset. I have always enjoyed the F.E.A.R. series in the past until now.  This is a terrible end to what used to be a wonderful and atmospheric storyline. F.E.A.R.  was blazing a trail all of it's own until F3 came along.The graphics may be slightly nicer but that's where the positives just shoot off at a tangent. The gameplay is mediocre - The difficulty is variable - The storyline was written like it was done by imaganative kids at best - The atmosphere and immersiveness of the previous offerings is overwhelmingly and completley extinct in this version.  Don't buy it.I only played it through after paying for it like a lamb to the slaughter. Damn sure I was seeing it through to the end, even if it pained my soul to do so. Forever scarred - I can't unsee what has been seen.			"

												I played Fear 1 and 2 . However Fear  3 isnt well made . On the one hand we have a brilliant gunplay and so much gore in this game . On the other hand , i finished the game only in 4 hours...... its too short . This i not the only   problem . This Game isnt creepy or scary anymore. I miss the oldschool Fear 1 and 2  scary moments. In Fear 3 you will often laugh in the scary moments becouse they are made very funny .  To put it into a nutshell , if you want a short good shooter then get it cheap on steam . .....but if you want a good Fear  sequel , then dont buy this game . Just stay with Fear 1 and 2 and w8 for Fear 4.			"

												If you're looking at buying this game because you loved the previous games, don't.  It's got very little in common with them except the plot.  It's got none of the atmosphere that the previus games had.  There is no fear.  I am not saying the previous games were all that scary, but they had the genuinely spooky quality to them, F.E.A.R. 3 doesn't.  It really tries to show that it's a F.E.A.R. game, but all the blood and gore in the world won't bring back that feeling you got when you first heard Alma laugh right behind you and when you turn all you see the mere flicker of a shadow run past your periphery.They took everything that made the first games unique and awesome and made this another COD clone.  They replaced armor and health packs with regenerating health.  They limit your ammo supply, but leave lots of it lying around to pick up.  The SloMo drains too fast and isn't fun to use anymore.  There is no resource management, just run and gun.  The nerf to the SloMo combined with pre-positioned enemies takes all the fun away from anticipating where the enemy is coming from, using SloMo to catch them early and gunning down three to four enemies before they can react properly like the badass you're supposed to be.I am not saying the games sucks, it's just not I wanted or expected.

												The third chapter of this game is a bit disappointing but it has its good points....only for the fans of the FEAR series...Classic FPS, shoot at everything you see and, if you don't know FEAR yet...welll...expect a total horror movie style gameplay (with creepy sounds, messy dark hud in some situations, monsters spawning from nowhere etc...).The story is connected to the previous two chapters of the game; but this time Fettel and Point Man will be friends and they will cooperate to fight Alma....or well....at least they will try to cooperate....Gameplay, as you expect, is the usual AIM - SHOOT - KILL - LOOK AROUND - AIM - SHOOT - KILL - LOOK AROUND - AIM - SHOOT - KILL - LOOK AROUND - and so on. There aren't too many secrets or loots to find. So it's pretty pretty linear.Graphic is good with some good effects, but let's be honest...for the scenarios sometimes the textures could be better...even if the final result is still pretty coolNice arsenal of weapon to use but....they really satisfy us?...The gore level, as you expect from a game like FEAR, is really really high. You will easly see ripped body parts flying all over your screen...but....not everyone likes that...The longevity....well....that's a huge no no no....even if we play at the highest difficulty the game will still be too much easy and too much short. Ok if we finish the game with Point Man (the only character we can use in single player the first time) we will unlock Fettel. So we can play the game again as Fettel with a total different combat system (Point Man is a soldier...Fettel is an undead man with psychicl powers...yes fun to use but...is that enough?),So what's the good point if we like the FEAR series? The coop indeed! Ok this will make the game even more shorter (two peeps is better than one alone...) but at least you will always have a bit of fun because as always, playing togheter is better than playing alone.So if you are a FEAR fan and you have a friend (or a girlfriend/boyfriend) to play with....go ahead and buy the game!If you are looking for a good co-op game and you are not into FEAR...well....skip this game...there is better out there!Overall:Graphic 6/10Sounds 8/10Gameplay 6/10Longevity 4/10Fun 5/10 (alone) 7/10 (Co-op)			"

												On the whole Fear 3 single player mode is about 7/10. But  Co-op in this game was suprisingly enjoyable.  The powers available between the 2 characters make for a diffrent gameplay experience, which adds a unique flavor to the fps genre.  There is also a simple but satifying acheivement based level up system.  This is one game that does achievments and  hidden items damn near perfectly, mostly 'cause it always give you points towards increasing your chracters abilities.  Add in interesting if convluted story (Fear 2:( ), great atmosphere and a minor competetive element and this is one of the best coop experiences of the year.Grab a friend and play 9/10 (co-op)			"

												F.E.A.R. is a game series that does a pretty good job at combining the FPS and horror genres by taking aspects from both (Specifically by throwing you into the middle of an intense, non-stop gunfight with jump scares around every corner). F.E.A.R. 3 is a nice addition to the series and a fun game to play my only complaint is that it's just not long enough. There are only a handful of levels that you could knock out on your lunch break which is disappointing seeing as to how intriguing the plot actually is. Still I'd definately reccomend this game to anyone who is a fan of horror games or shooters, crank the difficulty all the way up for maximum intensity.			"

Has slow motion time which helps make the game playable for people like myself that don't have great fast twitch reflexes, but if you like a more challenging shooter just don't use the slow mo ability and FEAR 3 will then be plenty challenging.

												Unshackled from original developer Monolith, FEAR 3 was always going to come up against resistance.  Early impressions seem to justify this – the graphics are terrible (with a poorly optimised PC port),  the story is now more preposterous and impenetrable than ever, and there’s a bizarre focus on co-op that sits poorly with its horror themes. It’s hard not to draw comparisons with Dead Space 3, another horror franchise taken in a direction nobody asked for, that became more and more action orientated in an ill-conceived bid to make the franchise more accessible.Of course, calling FEAR a horror game is stretching it a bit. Even the excellent original was never truly scary – while it was tense and oppressively atmospheric, being armed with a machine gun and having the ability to slow down time was always going to take the edge off things. However, the horror elements were always fairly subtle – a girlish laugh here, a flitting shadow there. FEAR 2 largely abandoned this sadly, though it did contain the amazing elementary school level – probably the most creepy and sinister level in any FEAR game. FEAR 3, even forgetting the co-op elements, has horror elements so obvious and poorly considered that it is borderline parody. Alma, the series’ resident lank haired J-horror ghost (several years too late to the party even back in 2005) seems like she can barely be bothered even when she does deign to appear. There is a section late on where you’re on an escalator, and the Alma is just going in the opposite direction. You maintain eye contact as you pass, and it’s probably the least scary thing ever – you can just imagine her giving a half hearted shrug or honking a comedy horn.The core of the game, FEAR’s kinetic slo-mo combat, is thankfully still present and correct. The biggest change is that the game has dispensed with the armour and medpack system of previous game. My initial thoughts were ones of revulsion, but honestly it does work – supplies were so plentiful in the first two that you might as well have had fading health anyway, and your ability to pop medkits like skittles during combat made the normal difficulty a cakewalk – FEAR 2 in particular was almost insultingly easy.FEAR 3 is significantly harder as a result which is a welcome change, but the difficulty is uneven with some pretty horrible spikes later on. It’s obvious that some of the encounters were built with co-op in mind – there does not appear to be any concessions made to a single player. There’s a bigger variety of enemies compared to previous games too, but unfortunately these enemies are pretty one note compared to human opposition. I’m not sure that FEAR, known to for its excellent AI, really benefits from throwing zombies into the mix.But when you are fighting human opposition, the game sings – the gunplay is heavy and sharp, and the AI seems to have got its edge back after the lightweights of FEAR 2. The slo-mo gauge both empties faster and charges up more slowly, and though this can be improved with a poorly considered CoD style levelling system (why?), unlike previous games this ability is something you use when you need it rather than just clearing whole rooms. This is mainly down to enemies coming in waves, which adds a welcome level of resource management to every fight.I should probably cover that co-op mode as well. The game is built from the ground up to support this, which is a bizarre decision in a single player horror themed franchise. There’s a competition element that determines the ending of the game, but psychic ghost Paxton Fettle (still sporting his fetching bullet wound in his head) is so much more powerful (and entertaining) that it makes this part of the game a little trivial. Sadly in the single player you are limited to scowling mute beard-on-a stick Pointman until you have finished the game, and I don’t see this being a favourite to revisit.So then. Is FEAR 3 worthy of your time? Despite this review being something of a laundry list of complaints, it’s testament to the game’s core appeal that the whole package is still an enjoyable enough diversion. It never strays into greatness, but nor is it the abomination that it is often portrayed as. It’s just a shame that this will be how the series ends – a confused grab at the mass market that dilutes the appeal that made FEAR popular in the first place. "

												It's a shame FEAR 3 didn't sell. But I understand why. I'm a huge fan of the original FEAR developed by Monolith Productions, but its expansion packs developed by Timegate were not very good. Then FEAR 2 was lackluster, and Monolith made that one themselves! When FEAR 3 was announced as a Day One Studios title, we all sort of wrote it off. But it's the best pure FPS of 2011.Part 1 opted for J-Horror stylings. FEAR 3 doesn't attempt to be scary and fail. It just doesn't attempt. This is fine, because the thing I like about FEAR was its gunplay. The guns, the quite competent enemy squad AI, the slow motion effects. FEAR 3 brings this all back to form (2 felt a bit too ""console-y"") with two additions. The cover system is thankfully quite non-intrusive and doesn't reduce the game to ""whack-a-mole"" a la Gears of War. Co-op play is where it's at. In fact, the game is built for it. Don't play any other way or you may find it impossible. Note: the 2nd player has slightly superior powers.			"

												I've seen playthroughs of the previous two FEARs and it's pretty obvious that a new company made this one. The game feels like an average FPS rather than a true FEAR game. Most of the time you will be fighting soldiers and it doesn't feel too scary, although as you get closer to the end, the more ""FEARy"" the game gets. There are  a total of 8 missions , which brings me to the next unfortunate bit, the length of the game. It took me and my mate a little bit over 4 hours to complete the game which is a bit sad because, in general, the world felt awesome and I would've loved to continue playing it. What is a huge + to the game is the  co-op portion . The game is really fun to play together with a friend, which is where the difference of the two playable characters comes into play. You often find yourself in a situation where you need to rely on your mate. You get a decent story in a beautiful environment and after a long coop game you and your mate face a sudden twist that will make you either smile or frown,  the one who gets the highest score gets his characters' ending cinematic, Anna lives or DIES .  Based on all these points, I think this game is  worth to buy  from a steam sale if you've got a mate to play with.			"

												This game is quite possibly one of the worst games I have ever played. Even Colonial Marines was more fun than this. I'm doing Coop and so far my experience has been having a completly useless ghost partner that for about 45 seconds can do stuff and me stuck killing everything else. Now this would be fun if the ai weren't shooting hitscan projectiles with pinpoint accuracy with an incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cover system and terrible controls. Ontop of if the AI is literally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the only reason the game is slightly hard is the hitscan. You can grab a riot shield and just melee the base commanders (a super strong boss that is super original totally not just another human with a blue shield) and take literally zero damage and just click for 45 seconds. I killed 4 like that and that was probably the most fun I had in the game was how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and broken it was. Hell I'm writing this because the game has given me Vietnam style flashbacks of horrible Voice Acting, game play, level desing and bugs. So my useless ghost friend as we walk across a huge interstate above the ocean is battle mechs that blow up but oh wait if you get out of them they get full health instantly and don't actually blow up, he got out to revive me and got stuck in a wall forcing us to fight 2 helicopters for 5 minutes again in a fight that takes zero skill since you just hop out and get full health again. This game is pure♥♥♥♥♥♥and anyone that disagrees has even worse tastes in Video Games than people that liked COD Ghost. The fact that Colonial Marines is better than this♥♥♥♥♥♥is just sad. Oh and literally none of the game was scary it was just horrifically unfun, unchallenging and a waste of 5$. Oh I also forgot it has cool interactions like opening doors or pushing through revolving doors all the ♥♥♥♥ing time to slow down the game play even more.			"

												FEAR 3 seems to get a rough review from PC players as opposed to the generally positive reviews from the press, which is sometimes the case.  I personally enjoy FEAR 3 and love the series.  Yes this game is very different from FEAR 1, no med packs, armor... you have regen health and so on.  I was not a fan of the cover system in this game, nor holding ""e"" to open items and such.  This said those issues are minor complaints for this game.  The graphics, granted are not state of the art but I loved the atmosphere and style.  It is bloody for sure, not a whole lot of scares but some good scenery and interesting locales.  The sound and music were awesome, I really enjoyed the soundtrack for this game.  FEAR 3 brings to the table co-op and mutiplayer.  I have played several rounds of the off line multiplayer mode which is similar to wave style format and though it was clever and well done.  There are different modes to the multiplayer which mix it up.  FEAR 3 was a fantastic purchase at $5 back in the summer I have no regrets.  ...Did I mention you get to play as Fettel - how cool is that?, you unlock him after each interval is cleared with ""Point Man"". ✓Recommended.

												F.E.A.R. 1 was brilliant. The following expansion packs added a good punch to the storyline. F.E.A.R. 2 was also pretty good, while adding a ton to the wonderful story.Then came F.E.A.R. 3. This game is from a different development studio. The engine appears to be different, the models and environments have a new artistic style, and the gameplay isn't even close to the original. If you like arcade-style games, then you will enjoy this game. Between each ""mission"", you get a stats page showing you how well you did in the previous mission, as well as what items and rankings you unlocked. This is not at all what I had hoped for. I was looking for a more seamless storyline, like what F.E.A.R. 1 & 2 had. Granted, I would put up with the arcade-style of gameplay for this new game in order to learn more about the F.E.A.R. story arc. But it appears that the new studio had no interest in the previous storylines, and went in their own direction. This game almost feels like an ""inspired by F.E.A.R."" game, as opposed to the officially sanctioned game that it really is. Warner Bros. should be more careful with this IP in the future; it has so much potential, but F.E.A.R. 3 was a slap in the face of the original story idea.			"

												Pros: Playing as Fettel can be fun, taking over even strong enemies. Gameplay is challenging. MP modes are varied and interesting.Cons: The plot barely progresses(as usual), and there's no chilling background info this time. MP is(or was, when I played) bugged beyond playing, and thus dead. The environments are grimy and everything looks the same, in spite of multiple locations. Not much game-play nuance, and few additions to it. The mix of horror and FPS is at its worst here. Even mech-use feels as scripted and linear as it is.My recommendation: Skip this one. Read the plot online, if you must know it.			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 is a third part of F.E.A.R. - first person shooter horror series. You have to get scared, you have to shoot, no exact point of the game.Gameplay / StoryI've played all F.E.A.R.s - 1,2 and finaly 3. Well, I enjoyed first and second part much more than the third. Maybe it is a good story, but the game developers made it look and feel WAY too bad. Seriously, the story is shown very bad - a voice acting is bad, cut-scenes are bad and.. basicly how is story tolerated is bad! Gameplay dissapointed me even more. I cannot say its unplayable, but taking cover, runing, jumping, shooting - it all SUCKS in this game. I mean its so messed up, that it makes camera shake and bug. Speaking of bugs, this game has A LOT of them. I bearly finished the whole game. I thought its the end of the nightmare, but no! There is also a cooperation mode which is EVEN WORSE THAN SINGLEPLAYER. Seriously, its even more unplayable. They shouldn't have even done it. Oh, I almost forgot - I finished whole campaign in 3 hours ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it.Sounds / Atmosphere / Level designWhole game sounded like a good game.. but from 5 years earlier. Sounds were more like for a sci-fi game, in a space, on a spaceship - not for a horror game, on Earth, on our freakin planet. Global atmosphere was fatal. Game wasn't scary at all. I finished this during one night and gone to bed with no nightmares. Level design is slighty better, and I can say the best of these three. But the 'open areas' were realy 'closed' sometimes, cause developers were too lazy to make some skyboxes in some locations.GraphicsHere is what is as bad as gameplay is. I mean, its not THAT bad.. sorry... graphics... BUT YOU LOOK SO MAINSTREAM. Seriously, was that supposed to be a sci-fi game or a horror game? I must say though - models are made very good, and animations are also good (not these for weapons), but everything looks bad because of lame shaders. Damn, developers, that was THAT hard to make a Lens Flare shaders, that you included a fake ones in the sprites? Come on, guys...So...as I said - I enjoyed FEAR 1st and 2nd more than 3th part. I do not recommend buying this game if you've got a slow PC. I recommend buying it when its on a bargain, cause 20 ♥♥♥♥in Euros is WAY TOO MUCH for this game.4.5/10			"

												Background: I'm a very casual shooter fan and pretty undemanding on story while more interested in mechanics and overall experience. Originality certainly helps and appreciate memorable elements of any kind. I rate Crysis 2 as one of the greatest of the genre. I liked FEAR but was indifferent to part 2. Played Fear 3's campaign to the end but little of the multiplayer.Impressions:The engine looks ok and the shooting mechanics solid. There's a lot of realism in the world and gun play.. but that world is also drab and the enemies not particularly fun to shoot. The sound is really solid and the grunts chatter is situation appropriate and appears to intelligently adapt to how you engage them. However they also appear to be psychic calling your moves without eyes on you and are impossible to flank as they always seem to have a bead on you which dampens the fun of being a superior soldier, it feels like the game wants you to only ever take on frontal assaults in slow-mo and rely on your healing to save you every time. Makes 'Dead Space 3' feel like a a masterpiece of horror (another sadly tamed down, but still superior game) as it utterly fails to pull off scares, none are original or unexpected. I noted several early scripted jumps were totally mistimed as I was looking the wrong way or had already moved past the location. Overall there is a lack of polish and placeholder elements are all to obivous, for example flapping fabric elements are replaced with static 1 pixel thick sprites that jut out at as if they are stiff as a board.The Good:*Decent graphics and general audio.*The cover mechanic works well and gives some options.*Magic healing is handy but almost too handy.*Gun play is decent but unimaginative.*Linear route stops you getting lost.*Grunt conversations are pretty realistic and dynamic.The Bad:*Seriously disliked the Main menu interface, found it confusing.*World is very drab in the early stages and the grunts too hard to see.*Some textures and locations lack detail that jar in an otherwise more impressive world.*Gun sights actively make it harder to see the intended target.*For a cover game you rely on slow-mo far too much.*Grunts track you too well limiting flanking options.*Cover mechanic gets tedious and slows down the pace too far.*Weapons are boring standards and lack oomph or impact.*Fails at attempts at horror.*Slow-mo reveals the slack quality as, on a massively overspec'd machine, grunts jink making you deadeye shots miss. *Stealth seems to only apply when the developer wants you to use it.*Collectibles, upgrade points break immersion and other console tropes.*Linear route and narrow locations spoil exploration and experimentation.*Environment is destructible but rarely has any impact.*Story is too silly and becomes campy as cut-scenes lack impact and detail.Recommended for:3rd person shooter fans not looking for anything special to fill a gap, think more Call of Duty over Bioshock.Conclusion.5/10. Seriously disappointing shooter that seems confused by its realistic world and weapons attached to weak fantasy horror setting and characters.			"

												Assai lontano dalla magnificenza del primo F.E.A.R, questo terzo capitolo non convince molto.La Campagna perde quasi totalmente la verve narrativa e le inqutanti scene horror che avevano caratterizato il brand,virando verso un stile molto ""coddaro"" ed a volte completamente no-sense.Detto questo la campagna si lascia godere, complice un gamplay caratterizato da bonus contestuali  che valorizzano molto il proseguo dell'avventura.Il multiplayer invece svolge il suo compito senza infamia ne lode, proponendo delle modalità co-op godibili e divertenti ma che non cattureranno il giocatore tanto allungo.Questo F.3.A.R è senza ombra di dubbio il titolo peggiore della serie. Paradossale come cosa visto che era stato annunciato come il grande capitolo conclusivo della serie, ed è un vero peccato che le avventure di Point Man, Fettel ed Alma terminino così.Voto 7,5\10			"

												TL;DR - If you like co-op games and have friends to play with, get this game! 9/10 on the co-op scale. If you are a lone wolf type, move along.This game is great. Not because it is scary, but because the fun that can be had with others. If you were expecting a scary game just try the original F.E.A.R.. It was the only one in the series that was even remotely scary. Otherwise play Amnenisa.The story is somewhat forgettable but you never feel like you don't know what is going on (I'm looking at you Dead Space 3). The main reason to buy this game is for the co-op. This isn't your standard co-op run and gun either. Each player has their own abilities. While the hardest difficultly isn't extremely hard, you'll have to coordinate who uses what powers to help progress. I really did find this to be one of the best co-op games to date.F.E.A.R. 3's multiplayer modes also include co-op so there are things to do after beating the main game. ""Fu**ing Run!"" is by far my favorite! This mode has three maps which have you running from a wall could of death. You'll have to maneuver through the map and even enemies as they try to stop you. If one player dies, it is game over. So you can't leave anyone behind. Even on easy this is really hard to complete! ""Contractions"", another co-op game mode, has you holding up a building as waves of enemies try to kill everyone. The mode is fun, but can get a bit boring after awhile. The other two modes are death match style games that I do not care for and more than likely, you won't either. The downside to the multiplayer, it's kind of dead. No one hosts a game and you can't join mid-session. The online co-op game modes only allow up to four players but can be done with two.(If my time playing this game is low at the time you are reading this it is because I played through on the Xbox 360. I bought this for PC because I liked it so much.)			"

												While as a solo experience, it's just a disappointing followup to the previous games in the series, the inclusion of a second playable coop character with unique powers elevates it to a worthwhile use of your time. It's not especially interesting or polished, but the mechanics of the two player characters together makes it an enjoyable campaign to go through with a friend. It also tends to go on sale for very cheap, so if you're looking for a more coop stuff and have a friend to play with, you could do worse. Not my highest recommendation, but I had a good time playing as a ghost who can possess enemies and use their guns against them, because of course I did.			"

												This one is more challenging than 1 & 2, because its designed for coop, I think, but I like the difficulty in single player. The AI is great, very agile and fast-thinking enemies.The campaign has been consulted by John Carpenter, director of ""The thing"", ""They live"" and many more.There is a ranking system, you get points for certain actions. As you rank up, you receive a perk automatically.This is a ""they don't make them like this any more"" type of game for me. Very linear, to the point action with an entertaining story - NO skill-tree, NO quests, NO inventory management, NO saving - just good old fun.			"

												I think Monolith are trying to run their business to the ground. I was certain that they had done the worst game that they possible could with F.E.A.R. 2, but lo and behold, they have proven me wrong. Amazingly, F.3.A.R. does the impossible and manages to be even worse than its predecessor. The horror elements were pretty much reduced to quick-time events in F.E.A.R. 2 and have been binned altogether by the third game; the gameplay is as uninspiring as ever with most enemies taking all of one headshot to kill; the story is completely nonsensical even if you ignore the first game and worse still if you do take it into account; and instead of the perplexing abortion of an ending that we got in F.E.A.R. 2, we now have TWO of the bloody things. Happily, the third game is even shorter than the second, taking only about three and a half agonizing hours to trawl through.Avoid like a crotch rot.			"

												♥ Diverse levels.I'm not one to mind repeating levels/maps in games however it's clear that they put effort into the design of Fear's world. I quite liked how each chapter was a change from the last...you explore a variety of buildings and are put into a number of situations, instead of facing the same boss over and over again, or being forced into a series of mazes. Diversity in its design is a strong virtue of Fear 3. ♥ Made me jump.Though Fear 3 isn't nearly as scary as the past titles, it did have several spooky moments in it. Granted I'm a total scaredy cat yet who wouldn't jump at an angry little girl leaping at them while they're climbing up a ladder? ; _ ; ♥ Enjoyable co-op.Whenever someone has wanted to play a co-op game with me, I used to always suggest playing Fear 3 together. Why? For one the co-op is balanced, a fact that I appreciate. Unlike other games it has both players doing equal amount of work and requires teamwork without going overboard.For another, I liked how the average time to beat the game, at least for my friends and I, was around 8 to 12 hours. I liked having a game to invest time into without having to play it week after week with someone. I understand others have found the main story lacking time wise yet this was never a problem for me.In case you're bored or finish the main storyline, there are four, multiplayer, mini games to play. Very fun! ✘ The story IS lacking. I can understand people who value games by looking at all aspects - the sound, the story, the graphics, etc. I can also understand people who have the view of looking for one thing, excellent graphics, beautiful music, and the like above all else. For me what matters most is the story of a game. Compared to the other Fear titles, I agree that Fear 3 is lacking in its story. They could have taken it so much farther than they did - I found the relationship between the two main characters was filled with possibility that they seemed to purposely shove aside. I don't believe we need to be pirvy to every aspect of a character, however they made them seem like cardboard cut outs, instead of real...Humans, ghosts, aliens, there was no difference for they all acted flat and emotionally frigid. Not once when I've replayed Fear 3 have I ever felt a connection to any of them nor have I felt pulled in by the story. As scary as I found the first Fear to be, it DID pull me into the story and the world of Alma. The dev team had so much they could have worked with backstory wise, relationships between characters, etc. and used none of it. I'll stick to fanfiction to get an emotional high... ' - ' ✘ Very hard to play with motion sickness.As my motion sickness has gotten worse, I've had to give up playing many games, Fear 3 among them. Despite its flaws, I have always enjoyed the game, and would replay it every few months. If anyone suffering from motion sickness is thinking about buying it, I would strongly advice you to think twice, for the game isn't kind to those who suffer from it! ✘ I think the main reason people are let down with Fear 3 is when they buy it thinking it's going to be a horror game. Does it have jump scares? Yes. Is it spooky? To me it is. However unlike the others in the series, I consider Fear 3 a shooter/survival game more than anything. It's wonderful if you're looking for a co-op game, no fault there, but as a horror game? Not so much. Still it might give you a spook or two!Overall if you're looking for a co-op game, Fear 3 would make a wonderful choice. If you're considering it from the aspect of loving the Fear series, I'd skip it.  "

												I think Monolith are trying to run their business to the ground. I was certain that they had done the worst game that they possible could with F.E.A.R. 2, but lo and behold, they have proven me wrong. Amazingly, F.3.A.R. does the impossible and manages to be even worse than its predecessor. The horror elements were pretty much reduced to quick-time events in F.E.A.R. 2 and have been binned altogether by the third game; the gameplay is as uninspiring as ever with most enemies taking all of one headshot to kill; the story is completely nonsensical even if you ignore the first game and worse still if you do take it into account; and instead of the perplexing abortion of an ending that we got in F.E.A.R. 2, we now have TWO of the bloody things. Happily, the third game is even shorter than the second, taking only about three and a half agonizing hours to trawl through.Avoid like a crotch rot.			"

												Bite Size Review - FEAR 3The Good:- The slowdown mechanic is still satisfying in this game- A good variety of guns to play with- The setting (horror mixed with call of duty) is still interesting- Big robot sequences are some of my favorite partsThe Bad:- The story is very one note (need to get to Ulma)- Main character (Point Man) is unlikable and un-interesting- Some of the new mechanics like the cover system are less useful than just moving from out of cover with WASD- Less Horror levels/moments in this game, more Call of Duty- The first game in the series still has the best enemy AI and Horror inducing levels, this game takes a step back with both of these aspectsThe Verdict:This game is a bit of a mixed bag for me. On one hand if you are looking for a cheap 6 hour romp through a semi interesting game, this is a good choice. But the story is very linear and boiler plate, and the main character is a silent killer that has no personality at all. If it is on sale and you have played the previous two games, I would recommend it. Other wise, if you want to buy a game, buy the first one, it's better than this one and the second game.  "

												Full disclosure. I played this game before playing F.E.A.R. 1, it's DLC's or 2, and while I do recommend it, there are several large caveats and it's a tentative recommendation. Pros:- Looks pretty good, nothing extraordinary though- Co-op is fun- Multiplayer is pretty alright- Story was fairly interesting to me, if rather cliched. But perhaps it only interested me because I had no idea what was going on....ever.- Gameplay is ok- Multiple endingsCons:- 5 hours long, I was bloody awful at it and my co-op partner carried us, we respawned a LOT and it still only took us about 5 and a half hours.- Extremely linear, linearity isn't bad but Fear 3's linearity is similar to being on rails- Co-op gameplay is lopsided. Pointman's gameplay is well worn and honestly sort of boring but much easier, or Paxton, who has gameplay that's more fun yet not nearly as solid, it's much easier to do well in the grading system each mission insists on as Pointman as opposed to Paxton- Not horror, like not even a little.- MP servers are dead in the water- Repetitive gameplay- Questionable AI(at times)- Just mediocre, neither the graphics, nor the story, nor the non-existent horror help this game stand out.Now, did I have fun with it? Yeah i did, but more in the vein of it being a fun co-op shooter with a fairly interesting premise instead of it being a Fear game. I'd expected something else and got a fairly fun co-op shooter that's easy to shoot through.I recommend this to Die-heard FEAR fans, but even then only if it's on steep discount. Otherwise with the amount of other quality games that come out, buying this game for 20 dollars isn't worth it. "

Posted: October 5, 2014
												I know I haven't finished the game yet, but I'm making an exception to my recent ""never write a review until I've finished the game"" rule, and here's why:F.E.A.R. 3 does not cooperate with Steam Cloud, meaning that if something happens and you have to reinstall Steam then F.E.A.R. 3 will not bring over your save files, meaning that you have to start the game again from the very beginning. This happened first when I uninstalled then reinstalled Steam to clean my disk space of all the redundant files leftover from Steam's updates. Afterwards I had to play F.E.A.R. 3 again from the very beginning, since I took a break from the game after reaching a particularily frustrating boss fight. Then just last week I sent my computer away to get an operating system upgrade, which also meant that I had to reinstall Steam, which coincided with another temporary F.E.A.R. break as I have hit another frustrating point in the game. Now that the game has reset a second time I actually have no intention of replaying everything again up to that point, so I am now writing this review to hold over until some time in the distant future when I decide to revisit the F.E.A.R. series.From a basic and simple list of pros and cons written during my experiences in the game, I have generally mixed feeling about F.E.A.R. 3 (herein referred to as F3): The game has a vast improvement on the story, which I felt was really lacking in the previous titles, I'm able to follow it better because I actually somewhat care about what's happening, which was not the case before. Previously the exposition for the story tested my patience because it distracted from the gameplay and wasn't particularily interesting. F3 is better here because the environments showcase the events going on, I actually see and feel the world tearing apart at the seams, and without saying too much, that is exactly what is happening and it is up to the player to stop it with some unexpected help. This is made even better because that annoying little girl who'd always jump out and go ""ABOOGABOOGABOOGA"" is barely around. Alma, you aren't scary, you're just wierd. Get lost and let me shoot things. But the drawback with story is that instead of little girl jumpscares, it has cutscenes. This wouldn't be such a bad thing if not for one flaw: You play as a silent protagonist. Silent protagonists work if you have control over them at all times, giving the player control during all story exposition and making them feel like they are the hero of the story, like Half-Life 2, which did the silent hero thing perfectly. F3 however has cutscenes with supporting characters directly addressing the hero, who never responds or shows any signs of reaction, just stands there silently glaring at everything. Do you see the problem here? But at least the shooting is fun, and when you are actually in control it makes sense to keep his yak shut.Speaking of shooting, my god is the combat in this game amped up. With the tense environments and the unsettling enemies you're up against the game should have combat that's fast paced and free flowing, right? Well yes and no. The actualy gunplay is very tight, reactive and satisfying as you blow chunks out of your enemies with a good supply of firearms, that sniper rifle is a very welcome addition to my arsenal let me tell you. Enemies are varied and keep the player on their toes, ranging from simple tactical grunts who actively take cover to deranged bloodsoaked lunatics going kamikaze with explosives strapped to their chests, and it wouldn't be F.E.A.R. without the giant mech every now and again would it? The mechs are an intense fight making the player jump from aggressive force to defensive turtle in an instant, and like in F.E.A.R. 2 you can pilot them when you find an empty one, my god that part is so fun. But then there's the biggest gripe I've heard about F3. The cover system. Cover systems in a first-person game I find to be always sticky, clumsy and awkward, and this is no exception. A cover system would work better in a third-person over the shoulder viewpoint because the perspective allows it to work to it's full potential as the Mass Effect games show, but in F3 it's just not needed. When we needed cover before in a first-person game we simply pressed the crouch button behind a barrel, and let go of the crouch button to come out. We don't want or need some backend programming making us stick to the cover until we press the button, as it restricts our movement and makes things way more angering than they need to be. Keep cover systems OUT of first-person shooters. Got it? And then my biggest gripe about F3, the regenerating health system. In the previous games you could find and pick up healthkits to use when you needed them, which gave you more control over how the combat flowed while keeping you mindful of your current inventory of health, and that was fine, it was fun and made sense. With F3 however you just wait a moment and your wounds magically heal themselves, it's not fitting in the game and it made certain areas and boss fights way more frustrating (which is why I took my breaks from this game before I punched something). The big boss battles are in an arena with not as much cover so you don't often get a break to let your cuts and bruises fix themselves, you have to be always on the move, most of the time being in the direct line of fire of the boss enemy. With the healthkits system you could drop a few grenades and heavy weapons fire on the tanky enemy, using your healthkits as you do so, that way you can tank more damage which also made inventory management so much more important because popping first-aid like tic-tacs would screw you over in the inevitable boss arenas. With F3 however the arenas follow the same guidelines, leaving you open more often than not, but you can't tank damage. This is a major problem with the game, the boss fights aren't intense and challenging, their infuriating and kill the experience. Even the limited cover you have won't help you because some bosses have smaller allies that flank you and others can walk through the freakin' walls and get right in your face. It's not a fair challenge and I cannot play these boss fights without getting angry at the game, hence why I took these breaks that ultimately forced me through a series of unavoidable events to play it all from the beginning.There is also an in-game levelling and perk system that rates your performance in each level, giving you optional challenges to complete while playing such as ""kill x amount of enemies with melee"" and whatnot with the reward for levelling up being a buff in either the player's max health, reflex bar (which slows down time while in use, giving more delicious gunplay goodness) and other things. The only problem is that the game selects what to upgrade for you, you have no choice. If you want more health? Too bad, more reflex. It would be so much more engaging if you could choose what to level up, but for some reason you're not allowed to.So with all my mixed feelings about F.E.A.R. 3 I had to ask myself, do I or do I not recommend it? When the game gets something right, it gets it right. But there are equal moments of B.S. that make F.E.A.R. 3 take a massive step backwards from the last game which is by and far my favorite game in the series. So to be completely and utterly honest? No, I cannot in good conscience give F.E.A.R. 3 a positive recommendation. It's flaws are so game-breaking and the direction the developers want to take it is so confused that the whole experience suffers as a result. If you were able to follow and pay attention to the storyline unlike me then you'd probably want to play it for the closure of the series' finale, but otherwise I'd say just play up to F.E.A.R. 2 and leave it at that.

												F.E.A.R 3 is one of those games that takes an old classic game and tries to transform it into a new Battlefield or Call of Duty. I would sum what happens in F.E.A.R 3, but the story is so forgettable that I can't remember what happened in it, and I beat it twice. Apparently the two brothers have to go and stop Alma's baby from being born, but the game throws in a multiple ending that rewards whoever was the ""best brother."" That means A. you need to beat the story mode twice to get all endings or B. Play the whole 6 HOUR story mode in co op. Gameplay is dumbed down from the last 2 F.E.A.R games. There is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cover system, you can only carry 2 guns, health regenerates, and F.E.A.R's top of the line AI has been reduced to standard FPS AI.The worst part is that the game isn't scary. F.E.A.R 2 wasn't all that scary, but it had great gameplay to make up for it. F.E.A.R 3 has nothing going for it besides a co-op that, once again, doesn't make it scary. I don't know what went through WB's head to get rid of Monolith [Creators of F.E.A.R] and replace them with some unknown studio that never heard of F.E.A.R. If you really love the F.E.A.R games like me, just make up in your head what happens in the story, it would probably be better than what they came up with.Also F.3.A.R... really guys? "

												I'm pretty easy to please with FPS's, but this together with Perfect Dark Zero and Red Faction 2, is one of the worst sequels I've ever played. I first tried this on the 360 and then got it for pennies on a Steam sale or something apparently, well I want those pennies back. I am a huge fan of the first two games because of the amazing combat, cool atmosphere, and fantastic level design. This fails on all accounts plus more, even the new engine somehow feels chunkier and like a backstep from FEAR 2. The levels are small, the game just spams you with enemies with no time to take in any atmosphere whatsoever, the story and music is dryer than sand, and this game simply does nothing good. Surely there is another FPS you could be playing instead of this. Gotta love those ninja zombies who throw rapid firing silent knives or something at you.			"

												Get this game not if you're inexperienced with the F.E.A.R universe for its been more of a let down for fans. The game is hardly horror and more of a Co-op experience on campaign. Get two copies of this for you and your good buddy/partner to play for it does offer a great competitive coop experience. In short, you play as alma's two sons, competiting against each other for stats, and your overall performance impacts the ending as who's the ""Favourite Son"". So its all sibling rivilary.Multiplayer modes are great! sort of the zombie suriving experience call of duty delivers.Overall, must play if two people are willing to play together. But if you're looking for spooks and real fear, go for F.E.A.R 2			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 is a linear shooter that could be summerized as a bunch of arena like rooms filled with enemies and bound by empty corridors. Scripting is minimal, story is disjuncted, but the environments are well made and interesting to wander through. The game isn't an horror game, but it is spooky in places. The real meat of the experience is combat: great enemy AI, sections with mechas you can control, conventional but efficient weaponry, and most of all a great coop campaign. With the addition of a new playable character that has rather original ways to kill or assist the first player, this coop mode is more than just singleplayer campaign with two players. As both characters complete each other or compete for the highest score, one is more like a grunt shooting in traditional fashion his way through the enemies while the second is more like a tactician able to seize control of an enemy of his choice and thus creating a mess in enemies' ranks, but also able to single enemies out for the first player to kill swiftly. There are other tricks you can use in tandem, but possessing enemies of various kinds never gets old.All in all this coop mode makes an otherwise conventional game extremely worthwhile for coop afficionados. Be advised that the game is rather short though (5-6 hours long).			"

												This game was only Okay. Not as much jump scare as F.E.A.R 1 but it was ok. It was nice to return to the main character at long last. but that is where the pleasantries end as playing as Paxton Fettel is a flop they could have made it great and missed by a mile, as they have not improved the graphics by much at all and the characters look almost cartoon like. What happened to the amazing and creepy feel of F.E.A.R, F.E.A.R Extraction Point and F.E.A.R Perseus Mandate? I was hoping for more intense graphics and better weapons not a child’s cartoon characters arsenal. Hopefully they will realise there mistake and return to the original style of game play but as for F.E.A.R 3 I rate this game 3/10 (my lowest rating to date)			"

												This game is an insult to the original FEAR. The AI has been dumbed down, the guns feel weightless and sound dull, the atmosphere has been gutted to be another action FPS, the HUD is a cluttered mess, a completely pointless XP system has been added, the lighting and effects are not as impressive as they used to be, the list goes on and on. I've seen people say the co-op makes this game bearable, but I found this to be completely untrue. My first playthrough was co-op with my best friend and as my Steam hour count shows, we couldn't make it past the first few hours. What we played was just another mass-manufactured action shooter with none of the attention to detail of the original.The original FEAR was not perfect. However, what in lacked in level design and enemy variety it made up for with superior gunplay, spectacular effects and lighting, and a haunting atmosphere. FEAR 3 has none of that. It's a homogeneous clone of every other popular FPS on the market to appeal to widest common denominator. Such a damn shame.			"

												If this game was released as its own title, it honestly might have done a lot better. As a fear game it is quite unfaithful.The game itself is actually pretty fun to play, and the multiplayer contractions mode was really cool. Basically you fight waves of illusionary soldiers/creatures, and between waves you can repair barricades and collect weapon caches.The single player is trash, almost entirely due to the fact that it's so unfaithful to the original. From the mood to the guns and atmosphere, it's weird. Like uncannily weird. You spend a lot of time fighting in spaces like suburbs, supermarkets and airports. Where as in FEAR 1 and 2 the game was  more localized around industrial areas and downtown cityscapes, it feels very weird to spend your time fighting in these much less industrial areas.This game is also not scary at all. I really don't remember anything in the game that was legitimately scary in the same vein of the first two games. But to be fair I also feel like the game ended up way past its prime, I think the original theme was already played out to death, the way the story pans out in this last game makes light of the entire supernatural threat from the first two games.So basically, it's call of duty with spooky stuff, except the spooky stuff is on your side. Or something.			"

The gameplay is also repetitive, waves of enemies, and with the usual controlled linearity and lack of exploration opportunities.Pity.			"

												A great climactic way to round out the series.It doesn't really try to frighten you so much as the first one did, but then again at this point in the series you should be used to what is going on.As the first one touched on the supernatural and the second installment delved further...this third one goes balls deep.Non-stop adrenaline all the way through - two storylines to play through - one for each brother.That's right, play as not only Point Man, but his brother Fettel for the first time ever.Decimate waves of enemies with your psionic abilities and view the alternate ending!Recruit, Commando, Fearless & Insane difficulties to playthrough.9/10 - Thoroughly enjoyed it, I recommend it.

												F.E.A.R 3 is one of those games that takes an old classic game and tries to transform it into a new Battlefield or Call of Duty. I would sum what happens in F.E.A.R 3, but the story is so forgettable that I can't remember what happened in it, and I beat it twice. Apparently the two brothers have to go and stop Alma's baby from being born, but the game throws in a multiple ending that rewards whoever was the ""best brother."" That means A. you need to beat the story mode twice to get all endings or B. Play the whole 6 HOUR story mode in co op. Gameplay is dumbed down from the last 2 F.E.A.R games. There is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cover system, you can only carry 2 guns, health regenerates, and F.E.A.R's top of the line AI has been reduced to standard FPS AI.The worst part is that the game isn't scary. F.E.A.R 2 wasn't all that scary, but it had great gameplay to make up for it. F.E.A.R 3 has nothing going for it besides a co-op that, once again, doesn't make it scary. I don't know what went through WB's head to get rid of Monolith [Creators of F.E.A.R] and replace them with some unknown studio that never heard of F.E.A.R. If you really love the F.E.A.R games like me, just make up in your head what happens in the story, it would probably be better than what they came up with.Also F.3.A.R... really guys? "

												This is problably the most weak game of the trilogy, and for the ones who played FEAR when it was released, its shame that even having better graphics, still doesnt give you the same feeling of the first one, at some point this story lost its direction and right after the first FEAR, the only thing they all have in common is the name, nothing else.There are so many changes that didnt make the game stand out, one of them, problably the most important is the enemy AI, the lack of reaction to player behiavor and interaction with the scenary, made all the realistic feeling go away, their interaction with each other also changed and most of the time they end up talking trash killing the little imersion the game build with players.Another strong point of FEAR, was the ambient around the player with Alma making short but memorable appereance betwen levels that always keep players on their toes and that horror feeling that many games simply cant deliver, specially when we are talking about shooter.Dont take me wrong, was a shooter, FEAR 3 is good shooter, fun and entertaining enough to be recommended and good game to have in your library, but with FEAR label, is just another failed project that couldnt keep up the pace with expectations players had after the sucess of the first one, all the problems around VU Games/Sierra and Monolith maybe killed one of the most important games that redifined shooters completly combining horror with action.

												Day 1 Studios gave the new F.E.A.R. game the refreshing stimulus the franchise has deserved after the second entry. While F.E.A.R. 2 was a solid FPS it was also old with ageing mechanics that couldn't held up against the best in the genre. The latest game became modernish with updated gameplay mechanics. On one hand it was a good decision (it had to be done), on other side it isn't unique enough to separate itself from the competition.F.3.A.R starts off 8 months after the second game. Point Man is our protagonist once again and he has to team up with his long gone brother, Fettel to get out of a prison and find his squad mate, Jin, who is in danger. Paranormal activities are a big part of this game too. Only this time around Alma isn't the antagonist, but something called the Creep. The story of the game won't leave any deep marks in you. It's flat and uninteresting. It's hard to take the story seriously when it doesn't prove its worthiness. Your personal goal will be reaching checkpoints after checkpoints to beat campaign. And it will be done after just around 6 hours. It's a shame really because with a more intriguing story this game could have made a mark.Luckily F.E.A.R. 3 isn't short on content. Not at all. After completing the campaign you can kill your time with various game modes. Many of them are essentially a modified version of the original campaign, but the changes made in those modes are not only worth a try but also great fun. The campaign is made of 8 intervals, each of them takes around 30-45 minutes to complete. After completing an interval you can replay it as Point Man or Fetter with all its unique psychic abilities. He has the ability to posses common enemies. You'll appreciate the change of pace. Also, you can hop in a co-op campaign with your friend. One controls Fettel the other Point Man. It isn't a novelty at all, but great to see the developer putting in the game options like this. When you exploit everything the single player modes can offer there is a multiplayer option in the game. Sadly the multiplayer of the third game was never as popular as the first game's MP. If you want to try this option most likely you have to play with your own friends as very few gamers are left playing F.3.A.R. over the internet.Moving to different territories, the looks of the game are passable. It's isn't a beautiful, nor a bad looking game. To its defense they put more emphasis on minor details, so this time a book on a table will actually look like one instead of a bunch of blurred pixels. The gameplay has been completely refreshed. The previous game in the franchise was getting old and set back by wrong decisions during the development. Not this game though. It feels like a modern shooter where you bullets do matter. When you shoot a soldier in this feet he grabs it or tumbles and the gunfight is much more vivid and powerful. Day 1 made the right decisions to cut the useless features and refresh the remaining ones. It's a great shooter, but beyond that it offers nothing more. Nothing that could differentiate this game from the others. Fear in F.E.A.R. 3 is almost non existent. There are moments here and there when you'll look around suspiciously, but that's about it. The franchise has switched genres over the years. From psychological horror it became a solid action oriented shooter. We can't say it was a bad decision, but we can say that there isn't many horror games in the market while there's a legion of action shooters to choose from; good, bad or worse. It's a pity that in this era a franchise has to get more action oriented to survive, and sometimes even that might not be enough. Again, F.E.A.R. 3 is a great shooter and it definitely benefited from the changes made around it, but the industry and the gamers might not.Rating: 80/100; Replay Value: 3/5; To Beat: 6 hours; Played on: normal.

												If steam would allow you to add a mixed review on this game it would be here...If you played the first 2 fears which were pretty damn awsome this game takes a more of a less scary aproach and put alot more action into the mix, of course there are scares but they happen alot less frequently making this game stand out from the others..I really had fun playing it with my friend and single player too alothough it just lost its scary and unique charm and tried to take on a more of a action game than a horror/fps game like the first 2 games, so if you like the first 2 I kind of recomend it if your into the story line as for this closes it up but if you like the first 2 games style and gameplay I wouldn't recomend this.Pros- Fun action packed game- Co-op is nice and fun- Closes up the story if you wanted to see what happens nextCons- Takes on of a more action aproach which I didnt like- Can be fustrating at times- Less spooksOverall I liked the game, but didn't like it at the same time, once again if steam allowed me to put a ""mixed"" review here it would be on this game, most of this review came out by my opinion so if you want to give it a shot go do it!7.5/10			"

												Not your daddy's FEAR. It's a step down from FEAR1 and definitely a huge change of pace. But it's got satisfying shooting, interesting set pieces (I mean that, I can REMEMBER every specific battle in this game. How many shooters have that many memorable fights? This game does a lot to shape each encounter so it feels unique.), a cute scoring system, and some colorful environments.It's not great but it's a game that really had some love put into it. The regen health is a pain and the cover system works on consoles but is awful on PC but it does not hinder the game. A solid effort and a fun time-waster. Better if you can do it in co-op.			"

												Take FEAR 2, side grade the graphics and change the art style and turn it more into Call of Duty.  No seriously, the second campaign stage is the same Favela from Modern Warfare 2.  BUT.  The multiplayer was tops.  Wish they would go back to the co-op style (not campaign), but they've killed the franchise with FEAR ONLINE.			"

												I purchased this as ""juat another co-op game"". Today I have to admit - this game is great. A truly nice co-op experience.In the co-op campaign (2-player co-op) you and your partner are two different species altogether, and with different abilities. Your abilities will have synergistic effect ( 1+1 > 2 ). Well that's what real co-op is, isn't it?In the multiplayer ( most modes among which is co-op only ), one is a wave survival game. You have to carry-in ammunition in those short ""in-between"" times, where co-op is required if you want to extend the time a little bit into the succeeding wave. There is another mode where you have to keep running away from some dark wall that chases to engulf you into death. Even this mode needs a lot of co-op play (revives and all).			"

												After giving it multiple goes after reinstalling it, and finally just sticking with it, I just still can't really recommend it for multiple reasons.It is obvious that much of this game was made to simply just try to jump onto the success of more modern shooters like Call of Duty, even though the series originated from much of the opposite. Almost every gun except for the shotgun has Aim Down Sights, no more collecting and using med-kits because your health regenerates, only two weapons max, and instead of leaning left and right you press a button to glue yourself to nearby chest-high-walls.There are so many things wrong with this game not only from the point of an original F.E.A.R. fan, but even when stood on its own.-Annoying and unrealistic Bloody Screen when wounded, accompanied with fast acting health regeneration.Completely slows down gameplay, makes certain areas extremely easy due to being near invincible, and makes some areas extremely hard due to not being able to heal instantaneously via med-kit and having to find a spot not being hitscanned into oblivion.-Kung-fu moves have been chopped out. No punches, just a knife. No bicycle kicks, just one dinky kick. These simple animations made the last games so much more fun, even if the new moves do exactly the same purpose. The aesthetic just isn't the same.-The first 2 or 3 level designs are ripped straight out of Modern Warfare. ""Escape the Prison!"" ""Escape the South American Favela!"" Truly takes you out of the F.E.A.R. universe, and it's a shame that they thought opening with such unfitting levels would be a good idea when it only helps make an even worse first impression.-No more finding health and slowmo upgrades throughout the environment. To improve your health and slowmo, you have to rank up with the new score and challenge system. You can still find hidden dolls and certain bodies that give instant extra ""score"" (XP really), but it's such a strange decision to add a rank and score system into a game that was basically the opposite of an arcade/points based game...-The horror aspect of this game was weaker than ever before, even though it was never my favorite part of the games before these. There are a lot less times where the game tries to jump scare you, and even when they do you don't get caught off gaurd because they try to pull one off in the middle of a warzone.-They gave Point-man a face. A boring, bearded, scowling face. Yet he still never talks... As if it wasn't enough that he couldn't do badass psychic kung-fu anymore.-The enemies are just not intimidating anymore. The AI is still OK, but it just does not seem as good as the AI in the first game. The voices for them don't have the badass radio static that the first game had, and they spend 90% of their time completely behind cover.-The new cover system is ok, but having the ability to lean like we used to is much more handy as it gives the player to make useful cover out of anything, whereas now you can only lean out from very certain few pieces of scenery. Half of your head seems to be poking out of cover most of the time as you can still get torn to shreds, enemies are able to hide in cover better than you.The game overall is OK, but as a F.E.A.R. game, or as an olds-chool shooter, it is just so underwhelming and hard to enjoy. Even if I was a completely blank slate on the series, I would still feel very unfavorably for this game, as it seems to attempt to merge the newer Modern Warfare type shooter with older Doom (3) type shooters, and it just becomes such a clunky mess. There are an annoying amount of out-of-character cutscenes, there are an annoying amount of context actions like going through doors, or turnstiles, or over chest-high-walls...It's just a shame that the series that helped make PC gaming PC Gaming was obviously developed for more of the younger console crowd involved, but only managed to sort of make an experience not very enjoyable for either type of gamer, PC or console. All I can really hope for is for some sort of spiritual successor to F.E.A.R. that incorporates super psychic kung-fu soldiers in a more modern engine and graphics set, because this game just leaves me itching for more of the classics.

												F.E.A.R. 3 is a fun and well polished shooter, IF you're looking for a fun casual experience a la Call of Duty, but do NOT mistake it for a sequel to the excellent F.E.A.R.. The gameplay has now become a mix of Parkour and fast paced gunfights, the goal being to make the highest score by replaying the same levels, over and over.Interestingly, the campaign can be played in co-op, but this makes the game a little too easy, so I would recommend to finish the game in solo first. The game also features some very original multiplayer game modes. In F*king Run, up to six players are tasked to escape from an ever advancing fog of death, while the players are being pursued by an increasing number and tougher enemies. This game mode is exceptionally fun and challenging. Contractions is a survival mode tasking the players to barricade themselves from waves of possessed enemies. Unfortunately, nowadays it's impossible to find anybody playing multiplayer games or the cooperative campaign.			"

												What can I say about F.E.A.R 3? Quite obviously, It's the 3rd game in the F.E.A.R franchise, which, one would expect, would say everything. But in all honesty, it doesn't - in fact, the third installment of the F.E.A.R franchise is much more akin to the generic first person shooter than the trouser-browning horror shooter that the F.E.A.R name is otherwise known for.The gameplay is, to put it in one word, generic. You have guns, they go bang, there are a LOT of enemies to shoot with them, same old. However, the genericness is tempered slightly with a very nice cover system, the slow-mo mechanic which is a mainstay of the F.E.A.R franchise, and the occasional creepy moment, though undoubtedly nothing as trouser-wetting as the previous games in the series, which I have admittedly not actually played a lot of. There is also some geo-mod, but this is needless and hinders more than it helps. However, the game is still relatively fun despite the genericness and shortcomings.The story is confusing. Whilst playing through the game I had little idea of what was actually going on, but from what I could gather, Alma, the creepy little F.E.A.R mainstay, has become pregnant for whatever reason, and the main character, the ""Point Man"" and his brother Paxton Fettel, who was killed in F.E.A.R 1 and who has somehow returned, have to find her and... well, Fettel wants to eat the child and Point Man wants to destroy it. That's as much as I could gather.The game takes about 6 to 7 hours to beat, though this is somewhat artificially extended by the game's difficulty. I was playing on ""Commando"" (Normal) difficulty, and some areas of the game were heavily confusing and others were incredibly difficult, particularly one section where I had to defeat a massive mech which could kill me in a few shots and tear any cover you might choose to use to pieces, and also another where I was attacked by TWO of the most annoying enemy in the game, which needless to say was frustrating.To summarise, F.E.A.R 3 is generic, difficult, short, confusing and has stupidly large numbers of incredibly annoying enemies. I'd reccommend this game only if you're a fan of first-person shooters in general and like a challenge, in which case you may find it quite fun (Though you may find yourself not wanting anyone to mention phase casters to you ever again), otherwise save your cash and buy another good FPS, or better, one of the prior F.E.A.R games.

												This game is an insult to the original FEAR. The AI has been dumbed down, the guns feel weightless and sound dull, the atmosphere has been gutted to be another action FPS, the HUD is a cluttered mess, a completely pointless XP system has been added, the lighting and effects are not as impressive as they used to be, the list goes on and on. I've seen people say the co-op makes this game bearable, but I found this to be completely untrue. My first playthrough was co-op with my best friend and as my Steam hour count shows, we couldn't make it past the first few hours. What we played was just another mass-manufactured action shooter with none of the attention to detail of the original.The original FEAR was not perfect. However, what in lacked in level design and enemy variety it made up for with superior gunplay, spectacular effects and lighting, and a haunting atmosphere. FEAR 3 has none of that. It's a homogeneous clone of every other popular FPS on the market to appeal to widest common denominator. Such a damn shame.			"

												If this game was released as its own title, it honestly might have done a lot better. As a fear game it is quite unfaithful.The game itself is actually pretty fun to play, and the multiplayer contractions mode was really cool. Basically you fight waves of illusionary soldiers/creatures, and between waves you can repair barricades and collect weapon caches.The single player is trash, almost entirely due to the fact that it's so unfaithful to the original. From the mood to the guns and atmosphere, it's weird. Like uncannily weird. You spend a lot of time fighting in spaces like suburbs, supermarkets and airports. Where as in FEAR 1 and 2 the game was  more localized around industrial areas and downtown cityscapes, it feels very weird to spend your time fighting in these much less industrial areas.This game is also not scary at all. I really don't remember anything in the game that was legitimately scary in the same vein of the first two games. But to be fair I also feel like the game ended up way past its prime, I think the original theme was already played out to death, the way the story pans out in this last game makes light of the entire supernatural threat from the first two games.So basically, it's call of duty with spooky stuff, except the spooky stuff is on your side. Or something.			"

												I'm pretty easy to please with FPS's, but this together with Perfect Dark Zero and Red Faction 2, is one of the worst sequels I've ever played. I first tried this on the 360 and then got it for pennies on a Steam sale or something apparently, well I want those pennies back. I am a huge fan of the first two games because of the amazing combat, cool atmosphere, and fantastic level design. This fails on all accounts plus more, even the new engine somehow feels chunkier and like a backstep from FEAR 2. The levels are small, the game just spams you with enemies with no time to take in any atmosphere whatsoever, the story and music is dryer than sand, and this game simply does nothing good. Surely there is another FPS you could be playing instead of this. Gotta love those ninja zombies who throw rapid firing silent knives or something at you.			"

												Get this game not if you're inexperienced with the F.E.A.R universe for its been more of a let down for fans. The game is hardly horror and more of a Co-op experience on campaign. Get two copies of this for you and your good buddy/partner to play for it does offer a great competitive coop experience. In short, you play as alma's two sons, competiting against each other for stats, and your overall performance impacts the ending as who's the ""Favourite Son"". So its all sibling rivilary.Multiplayer modes are great! sort of the zombie suriving experience call of duty delivers.Overall, must play if two people are willing to play together. But if you're looking for spooks and real fear, go for F.E.A.R 2			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 is a linear shooter that could be summerized as a bunch of arena like rooms filled with enemies and bound by empty corridors. Scripting is minimal, story is disjuncted, but the environments are well made and interesting to wander through. The game isn't an horror game, but it is spooky in places. The real meat of the experience is combat: great enemy AI, sections with mechas you can control, conventional but efficient weaponry, and most of all a great coop campaign. With the addition of a new playable character that has rather original ways to kill or assist the first player, this coop mode is more than just singleplayer campaign with two players. As both characters complete each other or compete for the highest score, one is more like a grunt shooting in traditional fashion his way through the enemies while the second is more like a tactician able to seize control of an enemy of his choice and thus creating a mess in enemies' ranks, but also able to single enemies out for the first player to kill swiftly. There are other tricks you can use in tandem, but possessing enemies of various kinds never gets old.All in all this coop mode makes an otherwise conventional game extremely worthwhile for coop afficionados. Be advised that the game is rather short though (5-6 hours long).			"

												One extraordinary shooter game. Simple notes:-Although it dosent have that scary factor that the FEAR francize started with, its still a very playable game because it has good graphics, gameplay and storyline. I recomend it, considering it a [must play at least once in a lifetime] game. -The story line and short animation clips are very much impressive and interesting; they make the player understand step by step whats going on and by the end of the game it blows your mind away when you realise where and how it all started.-My favorite: The slow motion obtion + rocket launcher = EPIC FREAKING GAMEPLAY.-And another thing that makes you enjoy the game more is that the multiplayer comunity is still alive. You could find almost anytime players who are willing to play co-op or MP.Great game! "

												A relatively solid co-op game that throws out the fixed health bar mechanics of the previous games in favor of a Call of Duty, bleed-from-the-eyes-when-shot regenerating health system. But, much like Noah's Ark, it's a couples only game because the game does not scale to single player whatsoever. If you get it cheap, then feel free to play. As such, it's not worht the default $20 price tag and god help you if you preordered this game.			"

You will kill enemy soldiers and make your move, like in the previous versions you have the ability to slow down time, also known as ""Bullet time"". This will give you enough time to finish off enemies or dealing with other situations. Your gun crosshair will turn into a different color once you are aiming on an enemy. When taking damage your screen will become red. Your health will get restored overtime which means you will have to find cover and don't take any damage so that you will heal up..You can't travel back to previous areas and sometimes it is really difficult to know if you are about to move to a new area or if this is a dead end.  There are challenges and weapon Challenges. You are able to skip cutscenes. Alot of collectables. Has bullet time. Has options ingame. Okay graphics. Crosshair will turn into a different color when targeting an enemy. No health kits but health recovers overtime.Has bullet time.Has options ingame.Okay graphics.Crosshair will turn into a different color when targeting an enemy.No health kits but health recovers overtime.Other things.If you are buying this game for ""Horror"" Then i am afraid you are at the wrong game.The game isn't that scary to be honest. i think the older versions were alot more scarier.-------------------I Give this game a 7/10			"

												Rating 7/10Overview: FPS with the ability to go into slow-mo The Good+ The game features 2 main characters you can play as. You first have to complete the game as 'point man'. This character allows you to slow down time while you blast away your enemies. The other character is Paxton Fettel who has the ability to possess almost any enemy in the game. + A cover based system in a first person shooter never seems to work out, yet this game handles the feature nicely. With a single press of a button  you can hide behind cover and easily pop out and shoot your enemies. + By completing challenges you acquire experience which is then used to level up your character. Challenges include killing a certain amount of enemies with a weapon, getting headshots, staying in slow-mo for a certain amount of time etc. It's a nice addition and it helps you change up your play style so you're not constantly relying on the same tricks over and over again. + I feel the AI has improved (yet still lacking to the first FEAR), enemies flank, hide, take cover and feel like a genuine threat when facing them. +Variety of different weapons and grenades+The shooting mechanics feel good, going into slow-mo and shooting enemies is always fun. The game also introduces sections where you ride a mech to change up the gameplay.The Average:On a technical level the graphics are decent. Textures are solid, lighting and shadows look decent however artistically the game feels bland and uninspired. Poor color usage and levels that feel and look the same despite being in different environments doesn't help either. The story is decent but it really is starting to feel convoluted at this point. Game will provide around 5-7 hours for one playthrough. Multiplayer and playing through the campaign as the second character can extend playtime for a bit. The game features some multiplayer modes that can be played in single player and extend your game time. The problem is that multiplayer is dead which is sad given that some of these modes looks really fun to play.The Bad- multiplayer is dead which also means getting certain achievements is now impossible- no local co-opConclusionThe more FEAR games we get the farther we move away from what made the original so great. This game lacks even less horror elements and tactical shooting from the previous entries and is essentially a straight up first person shooter with the slow-mo ability. I don't consider this a bad game but compared to the last 2 entries it feels like it took 2 steps back and 1 step forward. "

												Did you like FEAR? Did you even suffer through FEAR 2? Well, that's what you get for it. I present to you FEAR 3, the worst entry in the franchise.The good:- Gunplay is surprisingly solid compared to FEAR 2. More like the first game.- No almost endlessly respawning enemies like in F2- Sprint button- Grenades are again simply thrown and not selected. Thank you- Graphics are kinda neat- Fettel is still a badass. Kinda.And that's about it...not a lot to see hereThe bad:- Gameplay is so generic it hurts.- COVER system in an FPS...- Regenerating health- Silly ""level up"" system- Boring weapons- Bugs- Glitches- Even on easy annoyingly unfair at times- Story is quasi non-existant- No manual saves- Long checkpoints- You still do not talk...everyone else does...- I wonder what ""we"" did during FEAR 2...disjointed narration- Short, oh sooo so short, and still glad it's almost over.- Is this supposed to be scary?So, well, yeah, while the basic shooting mechanics are solid. Everything else just kinda falls flat on its face. The story makes little sense and is just boring. The scary or unsettling moments are almost completely gone. You have to run from checkpoint to checkpoint. Firefights are often protracted sequences with aiming out of cover. You die really fast in this game, but hey, regenerating health...yay.There's also an ""achievement"" system in the game through which you ""level up"". For example getting a sprint melee attack, more health, more slo mo time, etc. It's completely shallow and weird though. Not to mention you restart most achievements with every new instance. There are also some glitches and game breaking bugs, which require you to restart a checkpoint (for example, an enemy somehow dropped out of the world and was thus invincible, thereby not triggering the next set of enemies that let you advance through the level). Did I mention that this game is SHORT!? I played FEAR 1 for about 8 hours (12 with DLC), Fear 2 for about 6 or 7 hours as well, but this one? No more than 4 hours spread over 8 intervals. The different settings are also not very interesting from an artistic view point. *sigh* Just play FEAR 1 instead. It's better in every regard, except graphically.Edit: Also terrible FOV and motion blur which cannot be changed, unless you dig through Google to find out you need to edit the settings file in a certain way. That is just ridiculous. The game literally made me sick playing it without this ""fix"".			"

Note: I worked as a programmer for this game.The final chapter in the F.E.A.R. trilogy that does it's best to close out the series.  Much of the horror elements have been subdued by the simple fact that as part of a franchise much of the initial mystery has replaced with twisting and often confusing lore.The basic gunplay and level design is on par with games of the era but only the asymmetric co-op remains as a stand out feature worth checking out.

												This is going to sound strange.

Again I don't think this should be at the top of your list, but this is a decent game to get for $10 and listen to some podcasts alongside.*Note that I have no experience with the coop.

The motion blur and FOV aren't able to change and cause to me to become extremely motion sick when playing and I have to take breaks every 10-20 minutes so I don't throw up. If you don't get motion sick, then this game is worth the purchase when it is discounted.			"

												sadly, if you played first two parts of F.E.A.R - you  don't really want to try this one. The idea of horror is gone - replaced by rather weak arena type shooter - get to the big room/courtyard, kill insane amount of monsters appearing from nowhere and move to another romm/courtyard. Oh, and kill some bosses almost impossible to kill without finding a glitch in between. Only two PARTS of episode 6 (episodes are called intervals, 8 of them in total) can stand to two before games, but those are very, very short - quickly returning to ""Serious Sam"" type shooter. But - while ""Seriuos Sam"" was funny, this one is only annoying. Graphics are OK I guess, music is lame, but doesn't really disturb you. The new cover system does - it's not helping, it's only the great way to get killed. And story - it's not frightening at all. Finally - the game is short - I am not anytype of hardcore gamer - rather lame - and it took me only 13 hours, including numerous repeats on bosses... I believe really trained gamer would finish it in one, maybe two evenings. So - leave this one, no need to play it. Loss of money...			"

												Do you like horror games? No? Do you like gunwank? Yes? Do you take yourself too seriously? Yes? Then this game is for you.If you enjoyed the horror of being alone in a place you don't fully understand, with the only things explaining what happened being bloodstains and unread voice-mails in FEAR 1, then stay. The ♥♥♥♥. Away.I unlocked an achievement literally 5 minutes in to the game by killing 3 enemies while being in bullet time, with a small colourful box popping up in the corner notifying me of my glorious, unique talent.If you got someone stoned out of their mind, sat him in front of a pc and every 15 minutes changing between FEAR 1, Saints Row III, and CoD Ghosts and then asked him to sum up the experience, this is most likely what you'd get.Don't buy if you respect the franchises' integrity at all.Edit: I played the game for 20 minutes, then I had to ragequit, as I was informed of almost unlocking another stupid achievement, and remembered that I, in fact, don't find arbitrary, useless ""rewards"" satisfying in a bloody horror game. That is why it says that I have 0h playtime.			"

												By far the weakest entry in the F.E.A.R. series, next to the Perseus Mandate expansion. This game waters down F.E.A.R. 2 even further with regenerating health, a higher reliance on action sequences and shootouts, forgettable music, awful pre-rendered cutscenes, a decreased quality in visuals, and scares that fail to impress. The story itself returns to the series' main protagonist, but the game fumbles with its momentum, switching between action and horror sequences too quickly. The game can hardly don the style ""psychological horror"" as most of the scary elements are tangible, such as crazed humans or otherworldly monsters.There are no terrorizing setpieces like in the previous two games. Even F.E.A.R. 3's scariest moments are nothing compared to sequences like the school basement or the failed commander experiments from the previous game. It borrows too many elements from the typical ""bro shooter"", in order to strengthen the co-op. Because you know, nothing's scarier than having a buddy right next to you while you're afraid. I can only imagine the co-op was a corporate decision, and it was a bad decision. The story is interesting enough, and I enjoyed looking into the brothers' past, but Point Man isn't at all likeable and Fettel is a smug ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who has no reason to be helping his brother.F.E.A.R. 3 fell victim to trends. It's got a few scares here and there, but the regenerating health takes an enormous amount of edge off of the game, the cover mechanic is flimsy, the enemies are downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and the co-op is incredibly shoehorned. This is not how you make a horror game. This is how you make a sub-par bro-shooter.			"

												This game has more jump scares than F.E.A.R. 2. The only problem I find is that this game ranking system is bad, max level is 21, why is it that number? The point system is okay I guess, doesn't mean much to me. The multiplayer game modes are pretty fun, although very little people play multiplayer. I only played this game for the story itself and the story is pretty decent. 8.5/10 Has more replay value than the previous games.			"

												This game was incredibly disappointing. The push towards console gaming is made even more apparant with the 3rd iteration in the FEAR franchise, a game that completely abandons everything that made the original such a classic. The gameplay has been oversimplified and while it's cliche to say it's like a ""COD"" game now, it quite literally is. I'm not exactly sure why this game is even called ""FEAR"" because this game was less scary than Octodad. The story is completely idiotic it could easily be compared to something like Sharknado. And the graphics have suffered a significant amount, looking worse than the original game that came out almost a decade before it. Let's talk about the gameplay in more detail though...First off, the game is much more fast paced. You're given the ability to sprint, slide, vault, and worst of all, ""take cover."" This game mechanic is so incredibly annoying. Basically if you are near any vertical surface and decide you want to crouch, the game will automatically snap you to cover. This will lock you into position until you hit the crouch button again, meaning you have to stand up in the middle of a firefight just to relocate your position. The game also offers a new and completely unnecessary ""ranking"" system that constantly gives you these big cheesy notifications whenever you kill a certain amount of enemies in a row with headshots or something. This franchise is about walking around in dark hallways, shooting enemies in slow motion, and being scared silly by some creepy girl in the shadows. FEAR 3 seems to have forgotten all of that. Every level in the game seems to take place in broad daylight, and even when you do go inside a dark building, the ambient lighting is so bright you can see the terrible textures in every dark corner. Now don't get me wrong, the gunplay is more fun than it has ever been, but because of this focus on improving combat, the game's identity has been completely lost. Even the few times that you do see the creepy girl ""Alma,"" it's almost comical... like seeing her riding on the opposite escalator, looking confused as to why she no longer was scaring me. Another major downside to the game is the most immediate thing you'll probably notice, ""health regen."" That's right, they finally did away with the classic refreshing ""health-kits"" that make games so much more intense and opted for the ""COD"" approach where you can inhale bullets, take cover for half a second, and then jump out from cover good as new. This along with the near endless supply of ammo for every gun has taken away any type of suspense left in this game. I was able to cruise through this game without any real problems at all in less than half the time it took me to beat the original FEAR. So while the game is fast-paced and fun shooter by itself, FEAR fans will want to avoid this entirely due to the complete lack of horror. Now let's talk about the story. It sucks. It's just so painfully bad. Basically it starts off with the stupid ending from FEAR 2 where ALMA somehow rapes a guy (yes... according to the FEAR developers, a woman can now♥♥♥♥♥♥a man) and is now pregnant and going into labor. In FEAR 3, you take on the role of the original character, who I guess is named ""Point-Man"" and are tasked with trying to stop ALMA from having this evil baby. Your brother that you shot in the head in the first game is somehow, without explanation, back... and is now constantly on your shoulder the entire game, spoiling all of the mystery and suspense behind everything that happens. ""Uh oh.. sounds like ALMA is here, she's probably going to jump out at you brother!"" your brother will say as you walk into a new area. In addition to his terrible voice acting, your forced to listen to these frustrating loud screams that are supposed to be ALMA going into labor, but just sound like poorly done fake ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sounds and they sound absolutely ridiculous. Thankfully this train-wreck of a story ends quickly, with some completley random and unexplained player rank-based ending that I guess is affected by how well you played throughout the game? You're never given any warning about this so it was really confusing once I reached the end. If you're a fan of FEAR's storyline, I suggest you avoid this... avoid this like the plague. You're better off watching Alien 4 or something...Graphics are another pretty big deal when it comes to FEAR games. The original FEAR was one of the best looking games available in its time with revolutionary physics, shadows, and fantastic lighting. FEAR 3 is quite the opposite. I'm surprised games post-2010 can even look this bad. The lighting is all static, with hardly any dynamic nature at all to the environment in any sense (meaning no more cool slow motion physics based destruction). The gore is laughable, with enemies just exploding into tiny blood shaded explosions when you shoot them with a shotgun, and even on the highest possible settings, the texture resolutions were just painful to look at. The FEAR franchise has certainly fallen from grace in the graphics department. It's frustrating seeing a franchise die so quickly with obvious shifts towards a more action oriented, COD friendly consumer base, and the FEAR franchise is a perfect example of this. What once was a hardcore, scary, action shooter with no health-regen and some impressive visuals has now turned into a Call of Duty game with a different franchise's logo pasted onto the cover. FEAR 3's gameplay is fun, fast paced, and hectic, but this just wasn't a necessary change. The game's horror has been completely abandoned and the storyline feels like an afterthought. This along with the games lazy graphic design are all reasons I just simply can't recommend buying this game. Maybe if the entire franchise is on sale it's worth it for a short afternoon killing spree, but I wouldn't expect much that's for sure.			"

												One of the best co-op experiences, endings and credits song ever! Atmospheric horror shooting with two characters from which to choose – each for different playing style. Good graphics and tactical advancement. Also, F.E.A.R.3 has one of the most reasonable achievement system on Steam. The balanced, fast-paced gameplay and intriguing story will keep you going from the beginning until the end for the first walktrough, which takes only about 6-7 hours. But it's not a problem. After the first time, you can take the other character or try multiplayer. Still feels great.The multiplayer is ok, but nothing exciting.Despite some managable technical problems, it's one of my favourite games.Overall rating: 10/10.NB!There are few technical tweaks you should know, before you play this game.1. First, rename ClientRegistry.blob file to ClientRegistryOld.blob (Steam folder). This might save you from kicking out, when there are too many players on server (happens around sales time).2. Manually adjust the FOV, by opening the options.cfg file (game folder) and deleting the # tag and changing value to 85. This will save you from dizziness.			"

												Sub-par at best. I ran through the game on normal with little difficulty, only dying due to really hard battles. (By hard, I mean running around in circles avoiding a big guy while shooting non-stop). Not scary in the slightest except for the first few jump scares, which is saying something since I don't do scary games well. After about 45 minutes of play you've pretty much seen it all. The story isn't much either. Convoluted and nonsensical at best even after reading the summaries of the previous games. I feel like they just tried too hard to make this game scary.			"

												As far as horror goes, Fear 3 is probably the least scary and most tedious game I've ever played. Everything is so heavily scripted I'm never sure if I missed a visual cue for a ""scary bit"" or if I was supposed to only see the tail end of something disappearing and it was meant to be like that. In either case it's never scary and doesn't even accomplish the supremely low standard of getting a few jump scares.On the fps side of things it's all pretty standard and bland for a cover based shooter. The highlight is probably the AI soldiers being above average intelligence compared to the rest of the field but that doesn't really help as much as you'd hope when there are so few enemy types in such small areas. The gunplay has it's moments and some of the weapons you get very late on are kind of fun but that delay is two thirds of the game gone. I'd have liked to have more of that variety earlier on.And finally I feel I need to mention that I'm not even going to mention the story. It's just too stupid to actually discuss. The only thing of note is that the FEAR franchise is completely mislabeled as a horror series when really, if you pay any attention to the story, it's actually a tragedy from start to finish.It might seem strange that I'm recommending it after saying all that but it's more of a case of not saying anyone should avoid it and Steam not having a neutral option. The whole thing is just a weird experience of a blah fps with a stupid as hell story and the most tragic of figures in Alma.			"

												This game wasn't actually made by Monolith; it was developed by Day One Studios, the studio that was previously only responsible for making the console ports of FEAR 1 and its expansions. It shows, in a lot of ways. The levels are much more linear, you're limited to two weapons, and the graphics are arguably worse than FEAR 2's and maybe even FEAR 1's. The story is barely coherent at best (which isn't helped by the fact that despite FEAR 3 having actual cutscenes, Pointman is still a silent protagonist who only communicates through furiously scrunching his eyebrows), and you don't even get a clear goal or an idea of where you're actually going until around halfway through the game's 4 hour campaign. The only aspect of the game that's anything interesting is the co-op system, in which the two players are cooperating but still loosely competing against each other to decide which ending they get, which works a lot better than it does in games that somehow manage to be even worse than this one like Call of Juarez: The Cartel. And that's a good thing, because the only way I can recommend even considering playing this game is if you have a friend to play it with, though even then it's only a loose recommendation since this game is really only that fun under the ""any game is fun with a friend"" rule. This game barely has enough content to be a hard sell if it were priced at $10 or $15 like the first two games are, but at $20 it's absolutely not worth picking up unless you just really want to suffer through an evening with a friend and have expended all other available options.

												So I bought this game as a fun Co-op game for me and my friend. It was, at first. We liked the first couple act, then we realized what total garbage this game is. Even the song during the credits was a terrible cover to a song that matched the game. Im not saying this game isnt bad to play so long as you have your boi with you to make it enertaining. DO NOT PLAY ALONE its just plain boring and you lose interest real quick.			"

												I love this game and the entire series in general. If you like FPS, Horror, and Gore you should give this a shot. It has a solid FPS feel and being able to play Fettle gives it a new twist. I am playing backwards through the Fear series but it is really entertaining. I think it needs an update though to give Fettle more bonuses because Pointman seems to always out score him no matter what you do. I haven't counted but I believe it's because Pointman has more opportunities to score points and Fettle has to posses a body to even compete. Fettle is really fun to play just don't count on getting the ending you want based on Fettle due to the unbalance. Played through COOP with a friend over seas and the network code was flawless. Highly recomend for a good time just don't try and compete for favorite son, it's biased.			"

Redrick paced up and down the lethway, scounting down seven gay hunters along the wall, strapped in leather, Trevor turned and burned his hand on the knob, mouthful of Camel Snus, large frost that is, but he never put the back of his hand up to the pan to check the heat; This was his downfall. Meanwhile Morowitz got high on small amounts of crushed up pain killers behind the shed while Fred did the dishes and spat♥♥♥♥♥♥out the kitchen window. Martha was out swimming in the summer heat, feeling like a EHX Phaser and a 70s drum beat, and she pictured six white men with afros throwing football in tight tee shirts all summer long, unprotected and wild like Willy, who unfortunately had developed his photos earlier than he had expected and now sat in his darkroom all afternoon while Jenny screwed Kyle in his bright blue pickup truck, yesterday.

												For the price I got it at (about 70 percent off or so) this was fun. I feel as though it really doesn't have much in the way of scary moments. I guess co-op kinda kills a lot of that. If you have a buddy and love action co-op though I'd say go for it. Low 4 out of 5 Matt faces!			"

												Eh, fundamentally, it works well. But really, who cares? Getting the basics right isn't exactly a hard thing to do if you've got a triple A publisher backing you. I could say alot of things about this game in particular. But what makes F3AR a particularly sour note, is that it forced me to re-examine the FPS genre of that time(COD and Halo being exempt)So, picture this. You enter a room. There are 4 enemy soldiers in that room. Thanks to FEAR's slo-mo mechanic, you drop them with relative ease. One guy suddenly comes down a ladder, and two more from a door to the left. Down they go. Just as the last guy falls, 3 more soldiers burst through a window. Once they drop, finally, a heavy breaks down far door, flanked by 3 more soldiers. After a brief 'boss; battle, all enemies are down, and you may proceed to the next area. But, did you notice something? At no point in that encounter, were you ever fighing any more than 4 enemies at a single time. This was hidden from you through cleverly placed spawns to give you the feeling of fighting off a sizable force. But you wouldn't know it by the end, because bodies aren't persistant beyond 4 either. Almost every FPS game made around that period of time stuck to this 'rule of 4'. And on top of that, most of them had a slo-mo, or something similar to make getting kills easy. The moment you realise this, the hardest difficulties stop becoming hard once you're aware that you'll never fight any more than 4 grunts at a time. I'm not downvoting this due to F3AR being a bad game. Because it's not. I'm downvoting because this was the game that made me realise how bland the genre of FPS was back then.			"

YouTube™ Video: 2 spoopy - F.3.A.R. (PC) 

			Views: 39		

			Today we explore brotherly love in the form of bullets, bullet time, and swearing. Lots and lots of swearing. ***** F.3.A.R. is copyright Day 1 Studios/Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, 2011.		

To be fair, there are some good jumpscares and the atmosphere is nice.  Furthermore, there are some GREAT shootouts and good AI in the game as well.  It's really meant more for co-op, but plays just fine single player as well.  Haven't tried the online components, but the single player campaign is pretty damn fun.			"

												I have a lot of gripes with where Day 1 Studios went with the story and tone, but the gameplay of F.E.A.R. 3 is as fun as the series has ever been. F.E.A.R. 1 and 2 are much more well-rounded and sensibly designed, but F.E.A.R. 3 does have co-op. Yes, it does have co-op. Designing the campaign with co-op in mind is probably the main culprit for why F.E.A.R. 3's story/campaign isn't quite as great as the other two's. It ends weird and kind of anti-climactically too. But, it does have co-op.The combat is just about as deliciously good as the other games in the series though, so despite its odd disappointments in terms of how it concluded the series, it should still be a fun romp for anyone who liked the other F.E.A.R. games. It's mostly the same in that regard, although with rank challenges (a sort of points system) and noticeably less scary. Playing as Paxton Fettel is also a cool spin on things that adds replayability. And the rank challenges (which is in all modes) add an extra layer of fun.Also, Alma's just ugly in this one... :(			"

Of course in coop, the scary-factor just can't be as high as in single, but the fun of playing together with someone who also feels this game and can immerse in it with you is far overcompensate the latter problem. It has a unique atmoshpere and I really like the rank system. A real contra maybe only its short campaign.			"

There are some horror moments but it really is just an action game after all. The story is not event worth talking about, it's cool but it doesn't make any sense (especially at the end). On the other hand multiplayer seems to have a lot of potential.So if you enjoyed first two FEAR games and you want to play this alone and have a good experience, i don't recommend it. But if you want to have fun with your friend in coop and multiplayer, this is definitely a game you should try.			"

												If you're loyal to the series, I'd play it just to see where the story ultimately ends. The combat only improved in my opinion; they added a clunky but fuctional cover system, weapons that remenisce of the past games, and AI that make poor attempts to flank you, but still they attempt. The upgrade system they implemented on the other hand, falls short of what it seems they were attempting to accomplish. Finding the Psychic links and Alma Dolls even after replaying a mission over and over gets old pretty damn quick. By the 6th interval, sadly, I just wanted it to be over. I can't lie and say it's not worth playing; I feel like it's a hit or a miss, shooter preference with this one			"

If you are looking for a scary, exciting, thrilling game I suggest F.E.A.R or F.E.A.R 2, sadly I couldn't recommend this game as it's more of just a ""laugh trip"" most of the game I was just laughing at how insanely dumb the game is.

												I'm a fan of the previoius FEAR games but this one didn't do it for me.  For one thing, IMO the health auto-regen pretty much sucks, espeically in a game that forces a lack situational awareness during game play.  The player is forced to rely too much on auto-regen.  In my view, the boss battles take way too long and take away from the enjoyment of the game.  I made it up to the airport teminal and threw in the towel.  I unloaded the game and am off in search of something else.   "

												Howdy, So straight up its a 2.85/10Was a fun shooter, linear storyline, no presense of the original FEAR that I fell in love with, ran through it in 6 hours with a mate. The difficulty level only really slows down your progress and is more of a chore instead of being entertaining or challenging, just hoard ammo and you'll be right.Seems that it was produced in a few days with no further thought of being looked after further as the connection kept dropping out consistently. Also graphics have something of an arcade feel to it.Look if you have a spare 5/6 hours on a flight with a laptop and you forgot to download anything else then play this, otherwise just look up the cutscenes on Youtube and you can watch the whole game in 10 min.

												As a Standard fps cod clone with supernatural elements and a pretty good co-op this is a decent game. But as a fear game.....its garbage. This game is not scary, The ai is nowhere near as good as previous games (from what I remember I could be wrong) The story is atrocious. Now the last 2 fear games story wasn't the best thing ever but I always liked them this one its boring and uninteresting.The co-op mode its nice I guess but its not fear. Everything feels so generic. The gameplay may be good but it is just so dissapointing.			"

												This is a bad shooter that barely belongs in the F.E.A.R. storyline. The second game was tolerable and even good at points but this one makes you wonder why you're not just doing anything else instead. The second mission felt like a bad rip-off of the favela fights in a much better FPS game, and the constant pop-ups for minor achievements are incredibly irritating. For what should theoretically be a relatively slow-paced shooter with bouts of action this one misses the mark completely, and it even throws in regenerating health to hammer the point home. It's like the difference between the Pripyat levels in STALKER and in Modern Warfare - despite having similar themes the feel of them is completely different. This feels barely like the second game and nothing at all like the original. After the favela mission I looked at the ""Challenge board"" and the ""target time"" of the mission and decided that it wasn't worth continuing. If I hadn't gotten the game as part of a cheap bundle I wouldn't have even bothered getting that far. I feel sorry for anyone who paid full price for this.			"

												Much more satisfying ending if you let your character shotgun himself in the face early in the game. Also probably the worst of the Fear games. FEAR 3 takes the first two games, and strips it of its soul, then makes you do several repeatative fights with Doctor Manhattan cosplayers. I don't want to ruin the ending, but lets just say towards the end it just tells anyone who played FEAR 2 to go ♥♥♥♥ themselves, cause we ain't havin none of that plot♥♥♥♥♥♥up in here. Then the story derails off like a school bus full of children into a void where story and character build up should be. Funny thing is, took me 6 hours to complete Fear 2, and 4 hours to beat FEAR 3, but it felt so much longer because of how dragged out the tedious fights were with Doctor Manhattans fan club.			"

												I've played FEAR 1 & 2, lots of other horror games and here's what I have to say about FEAR 3....a letdown!  In a nutshell FEAR 3 feels like Call of Duty with a ghost that appears every so often.  FEAR 1 & 2 had major moments of scares and making you feel like you were always haunted.  FEAR 3 is just bad guys, bad guys and more bad guys...then Alma shows up and is gone.  I acknowledge that FEAR 3 is a shooter game but I think it concentrates too much on shooting and not the horror.  Furthermore, I'm upset that you can shoot an enemy in the face a couple of times then he gets back up and shoots and granades you a dozen times.  The AI is a bit too smart as well.  Before you round the corner they're already shooting at you!  Forget ducking for cover because they seem to have an unlimited supply of granades.  By the time I reached a ""ghost moment"" I was so frustrated that I was basically like, whatever Alma just get outta my way go haunt someone who cares!  The creepy moments are very brief and and they're ok but far from great.  If you like horror games stay away from this, it'll be a letdown.Pros:+Controls (after changing them from default)+Ablility to use cover during a firefight+WeaponsCons:-Graphics (worse than FEAR 2 for some reason)-Enemies keep spawning in some places-Enemies hard to kill even at point blank-No real scary moments, not a true horror game-For a shooter/horror game it's boring.

												I have mixed feelings about FEAR 3.  It has the familiar gunplay of the previous FEAR installations, but lacks the quality horror fiction of the first game, less so of the second.  The multiplayer modes are fun and addition of Co-op modes (fettel's character in particular) is welcome.  So, in the end it feels like yet another shooter with very little soul.  I would recommend for the co-op and multiplayer, but not for the FEAR fiction.			"

C.O.D.: GhostsI was shocked at how far this series has fallen with this. The second one was bad, did a lot of casualizing, but this is just awful. This is nothing like the original and did not startle or scare me even once throughout the entire game. The game felt like a chore to play after only an hour and the only relief I had from its terrible gun control and cover mechanics is being inside the powered armour so I could just hurry and get through parts of this game faster. So many 'wat' moments with this plot and how it seems like any notion of the crazy people was ripped straight from Dead Space. That ending was weak as ♥♥♥♥ and not only made no sense but Point Man contradicted himself.Only thing I can say that was satisfactory was that Jin appeared.			"

F.E.A.R. 3 is a fantastic game trapped inside a series which developed most of its inertia from great gameplay. The game takes on a new form, almost entirely, giving the player much more room and ability with weapons, reflexes and cover shooting; the game is promiscuous about enemy design and strategy, giving a lot of the momentum of the fights away to who has the bigger gun--a lot like Halo 3, however in Halo 3, Brutes attack you without necessary consent from superiors, in F.E.A.R.3, some enemies won't be as aggressive if you are faced with a mech, or a soldier with greater weaponry. The A.I. in this game pales very clearly in comparison to the original. Most enemies run right at you, knowing you have an advantage in accuracy and dexterity. The game tries to compensate for this by throwing more enemies at you, in bigger and burlier fashion, though, your reflex mode (now almost Godmode), gives you complete superiority in nearly every situation the game offers. This game wraps up the Armacham story and hastily. Something about Paxton Fettel living on in your psyche, due to Alma's pervasive ability and extrasennsory ability, allowing you direct psychic link with Fettel and some dead clone soldiers. Knowing that, it seems like a very indirect way to tie up a story about encountering a hellish creature, given that Fettel was the primary antagonist of the original game up until the end, and Harlan Wade was your antithesis, it would have made more sense to undermine the future of Alma, and give her a much desired explication, of her past, who she possessed and how she survived so long, giving necessary closure to a series that basically, revolved around her.The game is gorgeous, parallel to games like Left for Dead 2, and Tribes Ascend. There's a great attention to detail and even better presentation, if you're up for that sort of thing but this game is no Metro 2033.As a sequel, this game falls flat on its face. As a game, it's amazing and should be played by anyone who enjoys Call of Duty, Serious Sam or any FPS that's mildly hectic. A must play for F.E.A.R. fans, to figure out what exactly makes the original games so good.			"

F.E.A.R. 3 is a fantastic game trapped inside a series which developed most of its inertia from great gameplay. The game takes on a new form, almost entirely, giving the player much more room and ability with weapons, reflexes and cover shooting; the game is promiscuous about enemy design and strategy, giving a lot of the momentum of the fights away to who has the bigger gun--a lot like Halo 3, however in Halo 3, Brutes attack you without necessary consent from superiors, in F.E.A.R.3, some enemies won't be as aggressive if you are faced with a mech, or a soldier with greater weaponry. The A.I. in this game pales very clearly in comparison to the original. Most enemies run right at you, knowing you have an advantage in accuracy and dexterity. The game tries to compensate for this by throwing more enemies at you, in bigger and burlier fashion, though, your reflex mode (now almost Godmode), gives you complete superiority in nearly every situation the game offers. This game wraps up the Armacham story and hastily. Something about Paxton Fettel living on in your psyche, due to Alma's pervasive ability and extrasennsory ability, allowing you direct psychic link with Fettel and some dead clone soldiers. Knowing that, it seems like a very indirect way to tie up a story about encountering a hellish creature, given that Fettel was the primary antagonist of the original game up until the end, and Harlan Wade was your antithesis, it would have made more sense to undermine the future of Alma, and give her a much desired explication, of her past, who she possessed and how she survived so long, giving necessary closure to a series that basically, revolved around her.The game is gorgeous, parallel to games like Left for Dead 2, and Tribes Ascend. There's a great attention to detail and even better presentation, if you're up for that sort of thing but this game is no Metro 2033.As a sequel, this game falls flat on its face. As a game, it's amazing and should be played by anyone who enjoys Call of Duty, Serious Sam or any FPS that's mildly hectic. A must play for F.E.A.R. fans, to figure out what exactly makes the original games so good.			"

												I hate console games. The devs who have taken a great franchise and destroyed it by porting this crappy colsole over to PC. Let me list just a few of the problems. 1. There is no save. They've repalced it with a checkpoint system where you have to replay over and over. 2. No leaning. How are you expected to sneak in a game with multiple enemies and not be able to lean to take a shot. 3. It crashes. Constantly. The longest I've been able to play it has been 20 mins before it freezes the system. I've tried the workaround of forcing DX9 and it still crashes. Tried lowering the AA on my graphics card. Same thing. 4. 2 weapons?? Really! What the cr@p is that about? And a max of 175 rounds for a machinegun? This game is total trash and not worth even the $10 I paid for it. I got a refund from Amazon and promptly deleted this off my system.			"

												I am not going to compare to the original F.E.A.R. If i were to do that, this game should not be recommended at all.The first game was a fps horror that was not good at horror. I give it props for trying but there is nothing scary about soldiers and enemies that require a bullet sweep to clear. If i were to not compare the first game:This game is a solid shooter with tight shooter mechanics. I enjoy the gunplay as it was tight and gave me little problems while the cover system was easy to use and wont make me stick to surfaces like glue. The levels however don't appear to have been balance for single player. Multiple robot encounters on hard wipe my face on the floor a painful amount of times till I found a way to defeat it.The last mission was the hardest; there is a need for reflexes to use your reflexes to survive. Overall hard game but enjoyable.If i were to compare it to the first game:Completely horrible. The game does not follow the gameplay of the first game ever. It is suppose to be a direct sequel so the gameplay should have been improved or left the same. What started out as a first person shooter horror with survival elements is now a first person shooter that I will praise as being more complex than call of duty and nothing more. The horror level to me went from ""Horror house roller coaster"" to ""generic shooter number 117"". Try and get this game dirt cheap if u wan your money's worth. I gurantee u will enjoy the 8 hr game but forget it as soon as you start playing a true fps horror game like bioshock. "

You can't play as him for the whole campain? Why add a char and lock it out as they do?Overall it's good if you played the first 2, if for nothing else but some ""closure"".			"

												When I played F.E.A.R. (First Encounter Assult Recon), I was thrilled and driven into the story. The expansions were just as good. Then FEAR 2 came along. Graphically, it was a woe and gameplay had its' moments. But I found myself most shocked and not as content with the ending. Expansion for FEAR 2 was rather short, but made FEAR 3 possible. Too easy, nontheless. Then came FEAR 3. Play with yourself, play Co-Op, or hop into some intense multiplayer modes. For me, overall, I prefere survivals. The campaign was kinda short and the ending just didn't quite fit in with what I hoped to see in a conclusion. After all is said and done, I found myself wanting to go back to the first game+ expansions. Graphics isn't everything. Needless to say, it was a part of the series and wasn't horrible.			"

												I have a new favourite game! There are games that are good, and then there are games that are better. F.E.A.R. 3 is a quality experience unlike any other and is testament to the series. Tops F.E.A.R. 2, but it can never beat F.E.A.R. 1 ^^ None the less I recommend this game for several reasons, 2 of which are the shear size of the game (multiplayer, co-op, and single player), and the quality of the game. A lot of work was put into this and it shows. If you remotely have any interest in first person shooters then this is money well spent =)			"

												the only good thing about this game is the weapon aesthetics, and maybe for the fact it ties up a few lose ends and gives an ending to the series. sadly, this had to be the end of the series. everything in this atrocity is♥♥♥♥♥♥by♥♥♥♥♥♥standards. anything you loved about the original F.E.A.R. games, forget it, it isnt in this game. there is not a single scary or even remotely tense moment in this game, just look at the screenshots above. that is about as good as it gets with scare and atmosphere. the AI is as bland and mediocre as they get, even the Replica forces (who are now somehow allied with ATC???) are easily dispatched and only challenging by the fact they carry weapons that do a good bit of damage, and take a little bit more to kill. all of the genius, god-tier AI from the original game is nonexistent, even F.E.A.R. 2 had better AI. Paxton's voice, though done by the same actor, is somehow just terrible to listen to in this game, but that may just be me, it sounds like he is trying way too hard to sound bad and it ruins everything. no immersion whatsoever, no health bar, just that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ regenerating health system which only makes this game EVEN MORE like CoD. thats what this game is. its a very bloody CoD clone.playing as Paxton is actually quite dumb and doesnt make any sense at all. how can he die if he is already dead? hes a ghost and still takes damage and can be killed, and all he does is tickle enemies with a stupid little red ball for ""range"" or he can possess enemies for a brief time. not worth it.another crime this game does is it completely ignores the canon that was previously set by the first F.E.A.R. expansions, Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, meaning that the entirety of the events in those games never happened.just dont buy this game unless you actually want to see just how bad it is. youtube the cutscenes or something and be happy with that.

												Every FEAR game has been a step backward from the one before it. FEAR 3 brings some coop to the table through 2-sided mission design (play as Point Man or unlock/visit-another's-game as the ghostly Fettle) at the cost of extremely linear environments and dumb enemies. Any pretext of horror is gone, replaced by a mix of interesting ""scary"" environments and corridor-shooting. The game itself is WAY TOO SHORT (6 hrs).However, I still recommend FEAR 3 for two reasons: it finishes the ""story"" of the series and features first-person cover mechanics. I can't think of any other shooter that offers first-person cover on PC, and it's an interesting if limiting design choice. The shooting is also decent, although the gun models are too big (I usually don't care about that sort of thing).If you want to see the end of this sadly reduced series, just get the game.			"

The graphics are pretty dated, the physics are very buggy, and the enviorments are insanly linear. Most of the fear is gone with only a few sections in the very beginning which were filled with pop out scares. The leveling system is dumb and god help me it feels like I have tunnel vision. This game makes you feel like you have a fov of 30. Fettel (the unlockable character) is basically a silly rehash of the main character with little added that's worthwhile. The story is cliche, dull, and feels irrelevant to the rest of the game. Who are these people? Why is she helping me? I only see them once the entire game? I will say, the action in the game is pretty decent and the game can be fun at times, but overall this game is a consolized let down. 6/10.			"

Which is painful to say as it is a direct descendent of one of the greatest PC Shooters I've played. There's just not much to say about this game, its only remarkable in that it is so unremarkable in everything it does. The only reason to play this is if you have completed the first two entries and just want to finish out what the series started. It's a waste of time, but it is easy (even on the highest difficulty) and short, so it's not too much wasted.Don't bother unless you really want to finish what started off as what looked to be a fantastic series.

The guns have impact, the maps are well-designed, non-linear and lengthy, and the core mechanics work as a tactical shooter.  So, not a scary game at all, but a very fun game without much consolitis (thanks to Steamworks and proper key bindings) and cooperative support.			"

												Unlike seemingly every other reviewer, I actually much preferred this game to FEAR2 (it's been so long since I played the first FEAR I can't compare them).  If you forget about the horror element, what you have here is an extremely accomplished shooter - cover system is great, slo-mo works well, enemy AI is good.  The horror elements are basically limited to lots of melee-type characters that try and swarm you.  Although the warehouse/shop level did doa  pretty good job of buidling suspense before the actual bad guys turned up.There is a bit of replay value to be had here as well, you can replay the game as the murderous ghost once you've completed a level as point-man.  I did a couple of levels with Fettel before I decided that while being novel, that character didn't add enough for me to replay the same story with a different set of abilities - those with more time on their hands may well feel differently.Summary: forget the FEAR back story and enjoy a polished shooter.

												I have mixed feelings about FEAR 3.  It has the familiar gunplay of the previous FEAR installations, but lacks the quality horror fiction of the first game, less so of the second.  The multiplayer modes are fun and addition of Co-op modes (fettel's character in particular) is welcome.  So, in the end it feels like yet another shooter with very little soul.  I would recommend for the co-op and multiplayer, but not for the FEAR fiction.			"

												I honestly think this game is kind of underrated. The story is pretty complete, the gameplay is varied, with all the different modes. I suggest playing the story in Co-op your first time, and then playing it again on Insane (The fourth difficulty after you beat the game) reversing roles between Point-Man and Fettel, depending on which one you played your first time, and have a different experience, even though the  Then you can play F*cking Run and Contractions, the other Coop modes. And even after THAT you can play Soul King and Soul Survivor, which are the competitive ones.One thing that does suck, are the graphics, some levels just look generic, in the beginning there's one that looks like you're in Brazil's favelas, but the textures just suck, you can notice it in (for example) some enemies that behave like zombies with melee weapons in their hands.I'd say it deserves an 8.3 (Yeah, that specific)			"

												Buy it! Play it! Don't regret it! :)This 3rd and final installment of the series completes everything... and more!Sooooo not only can you play this game by yourself... you can do it co-op with a friend if you would like! The gore is phenomenal, the fear factor is back, the entire atmosphere created for this game was remarkable, and added features like being able to toggle slow motion were very nice additions, Being able to play as fettel or even being able to have him as your co-op partner to get further insight to his character was a very well thoughout feature that they did perfectly. The storyline all comes together and was brilliantly written! The upgraded graphics, physics, and weapons made this game the modern F.E.A.R that no one was expecting to be realeased (after that F.E.A.R 2 release haha). Finally... adding achievements and competition between you and your friends made this game able to live on longer than simply the single player storyline. All around awesome game!			"

												Let's be honest, this game's campaign isn't as scary as it's title suggests. Still I love FPS and I used to play this nonstop even after finishing the game once or twice. The big downside to this game is that it requires a friend for the full experience, sadly I don't have any friend who owns the game and wants to play with me which leaves me the tast to find a friend in the game community, but it seems that nobody's playing this game right now. Shame. The game also includes a ""survival-ish""  kind of game but it adds some special twists to make it unique and fun, still nobody's playing it.Overall this game is pretty good, I would buy it on sale since it's old and should have a great discount on it. If you do have a friend who plays this game you will surely see a brighter (yet darker ;]) side of this game.			"

												This game just wasn't good. The co-op campaign totaled around 2ish hours. I've got about 3 hours on this game, 1 third of that is me trying to get this game to launch and not instantly close after the splash screen.There is a lack of variety in terms of weapons, and I never felt like I was progressing in the campaign, it was just boring and uneventful until the end, which was lackluster. I barely enjoyed this game with a close friend, by myself would have been dreadfully boring. The characters are extremely forgetfull, I can't even remember the asian woman who you saved in the power station. Some of the people you fight are just dreadfully annoying, not even challenging. The maps are boring, and when the world is getting destroyed and sinkholes appear, you can fall 10 feet into one of those aformentioned sinkholes and die. Meh/10			"

												I think this is a good game, but it's not as good as F.E.A.R. 1 and F.E.A.R. 2 and it doesn't exactly feel like a F.E.A.R. game. It feels more like a creepy Call of Duty. It's still very fun though. AND it's cool once you beat the game with Point Man (the protagonist in the other F.E.A.R. games) you can play again as Paxton Fettel. As Fettel, you can posess enemies, blow them up, shoot powers out of your hands, and even hover explosive objects and force them towards your enemies (so at this point when you play as Fettel, it feels like a creepy BioShock). But even so, I still recommend buying it especially when it is on sale (which is what I did).			"

You can't play as him for the whole campain? Why add a char and lock it out as they do?Overall it's good if you played the first 2, if for nothing else but some ""closure"".			"

												Went in expecting abject♥♥♥♥♥♥ just based on the Metacritic reviews. First and second one were good, I figured the third couldn't be that bad, and I was right. This is a middling quality modern shooter. You still get the slow-mo mechanics from the first two games, which is always fun, and a variety of weapons strewn about for you to mess around with. The AI is some of the most aggressive I've seen in an FPS in the past few years, and it will really punish you if you try to hide and take potshots. Enemy soldiers will flank and converge on your position, and regularly toss grenades to scare you out. Even with the slow-mo it was a moderate challenge. The reasons this game scored so poorly I think, were that it's not really a F.E.A.R. game, and it's short. It's about a 6 hour playthrough in full, double that if you play through again as Paxton Fettel, but most people probably won't bother. As for not being a F.E.A.R. game, it comes down to the fact that the game is not scary or even atmospheric. It's not even creepy. Sometimes it'll do the standard ""Alma shows up in little girl form to spook you"" but she's just there and disappears when you get close. It's like it was a line item on a checklist of things they needed in order to slap the F.E.A.R. brand on it, and has no care put into how it is done. Excepting the actual gameplay (which is definitely passable), it's easy to see why this was basically the end of the series. It feels like a Modern Warfare clone instead of what the rest of the series was. I can't imagine it was anything but reviled by fans of the series up to this point, even if the shooting was still competent. It still gets a ""Yes"" from me because it regularly comes bundled with the other two games, which are certainly worth playing, and overall it's cheap. Being short means it doesn't overstay its welcome. So to anyone wondering if they should get a combo of all three games, or just the first one, pull the trigger on the bundle. They're all worth playing.			"

EVERY ♥♥♥♥ING JUMPSCARE I'M LOOKING AWAY BECAUSE THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON IN THE ENVIRONMENT, PROGRAM THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME JUMPSCARE WHEN. YOU. ARE. LOOKING. AT. IT. This game, much like F.E.A.R. 1&2 has a clear separation of creepy moments, from action moments, making the scares predictable and the only sound coming from my mouth is a yawn. They clearly haven't learned much from the previous installments. This game is too action oritented, the name is F.E.A.R. not CALL OF DUTY 74 GHOST BUSTER sp00ky WARFARE. There are in-game action achievements that reward certain kinds of behaviors, like hiding in cover for 200 seconds, spending 90 seconds in slow-mo, getting 3 headshots in slow-mo. Keep in mind that these are mandatory if you want to ""level up"" (Yes there is leveling now) and get more slowmo time/  be able to carry more ammo. Keep in mind, these achievements aren't one time, you can get them every single level. So instead of appreciating the game for what it is, you're going to be replaying checkpoints just so you can get some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t achievement to level up.You can't shoot through walls, but enemies can.Alma kills NOBODY. Except one random enemy who exploded in a house, but even then you can kill him before Alma does.This is not a F.E.A.R. game.Not scary at all, hhell they barely even try, it's almost entirely action oriented.

												The best thing I can say about F.E.A.R. 3 is that it was over quickly, the gore was plentiful, and the slowdown effect has lost none of its charm.The worst thing I can say about F.E.A.R. 3 is that the ""Horror"" tag is completely unjustified. Where the other F.E.A.R. games left a sense of dread. F.E.A.R. 3's tactic of scares seems to involve tacked on, sometimes cheesy moments you can shrug off. Even the jumpscares feel forced, and can be spotted from a mile away defeating the purpose of a jump scare.If you like FPS games that involve slowdown, and scrapes of horror...get this game. Otherwise, avoid at all cost. Get something better like the original F.E.A.R., Bioshock, or Metro: Last Light.			"

												It's mediocre at best. The FEAR story has always been kinda lame in my opinion and this is a snorefest. None of the games have been scary is this is even more so true in FEAR 3. I have yet to play co-op so that might be a little more fun, but after completing it with both brothers, I can say I really only played it because I'm stuck somewhere where I don't have much to do and my good computer isn't with me. If I was home, I'd have probably given up halfway through out of boredom and because there's so many other games to play. If you absolutely must add to your FEAR collection, then don't pay more than 5 bucks for this.			"

All in All , it's not as good as the previous games of the FEAR series, but I had had a lot funny moments playing this Game with my friend.

												FEAR3 isn't meant to be played Solo. If you have a friend you can CO-OP with this is a brilliant game. I played as Fetal on my play through and the different tactics opened up to me made a very good impression on me. The Campaign is not long which kind of works as a CO-OP game I think at one stage we will swap over and I'll play Point Man and will be a differen't experience. Between the mechs and the horror mechanics I think this is a solid co-op game but I imagine it would not of been as fun single player. As Fetal I was able to capture and hold enemies for Point Man to kill, Possess Snipers at the other end of the killzone and then between us take out everyone in the middle. Being bound to Pointman was limmiting but that mechanic made it more interesting like I had to be within range of him to exist.			"

												The best thing I can say about F.E.A.R. 3 is that it was over quickly, the gore was plentiful, and the slowdown effect has lost none of its charm.The worst thing I can say about F.E.A.R. 3 is that the ""Horror"" tag is completely unjustified. Where the other F.E.A.R. games left a sense of dread. F.E.A.R. 3's tactic of scares seems to involve tacked on, sometimes cheesy moments you can shrug off. Even the jumpscares feel forced, and can be spotted from a mile away defeating the purpose of a jump scare.If you like FPS games that involve slowdown, and scrapes of horror...get this game. Otherwise, avoid at all cost. Get something better like the original F.E.A.R., Bioshock, or Metro: Last Light.			"

An utter failure as a game. Leave this alone.			"

												Another great PC exclusive game ruined by console port sequels.  FEAR 2 was playable and even mostly enjoyable despite its flaws, but this one is pretty lame.  Halfway decent FPS, but TERRIBLE horror game or entry into the FEAR franchise.  Maybe playing as Fettel makes it better, but I haven't been able to make myself replay it to find out.			"

												Average game, horrible sequel. The gameplay is reasonably fun and does have some qualities, same for some environments. As mentioned in the key features of the game : ""F.E.A.R. 3 delivers all the hallmarks that define the F.E.A.R. brand"". Indeed, it's all about the “coolness” and the “attitude” of what F.E.A.R is supposed to be rather than what made it great in the first place, because the marketing derpartement always know what is good for us. Long gone is the atmospheric shooter with tense combat, welcome to a shootfest with generic AI and the usual corridor missions. You'll get the shallow experience you've probably seen somewhere else, not terrible not great either, good fun for an afternoon perhaps. On the other hand, the second character is quite interesting due to his unconventional “ghostly” gameplay, making it worth replaying the game or convincing/fighting your coop partner to get a chance to play as him. Its just a shame you cannot use him right from the start in single player.When I said it is a bad sequel, I'm mostly mentioning its worst offence to the spirit of the series made manifest into the achievement system popping up every five seconds to tell you how great you are, increasing your level but more importantly, your score. Why ? Because the game's design is centred around competitive coop, who gets the best score, gets the ending associated to his character. While it isn't a bad idea on the paper, having the scoring in mind and constant pop-ups definitely breaks the atmosphere that used to be a hallmark of the series. This is even worse if you play in single player since the competition becomes irrelevant as you get the ending of the character you are playing.This competitive idea, also serve a purpose in the story, since both involved characters are competing to show their pregnant mother who is the most worthy while at the same time completely disempowering her because of that pregnancy that is about to bring an apocalypse. Its good to remind that she decided to be pregnant and stalked and then♥♥♥♥♥♥♥the second game's protagonist for it. So we have a sudden 360° reversal, destroying all that was powerful and creepy about her, transforming her into a passive reward that gets ditched away no matter which character wins. The two main protagonists writing is also incredibly weak. If they were supposed to be unfortunate companions hating each other, it never shows, as one is completely silent and never seems to not care, making all the snaky comments of the other guy who is bent on trying to be edgy and dark even more pointless and annoying. The ending is definitely puts the last nail in the coffin to the F.E.A.R franchise, because F.E.A.R online never existed.			"

Congratulations!Here are some points!Hey look! A spooky spooky little man crawled accross tha- Hey look a dead body! HERE ARE SOME ♥♥♥♥ING POINTS.F.E.A.R. 1? Fun and occasionally scary.F.E.A.R. 2? Fun and interesting, has it's spooky moments.F.E.A.R. 3? You seriously might as well get Call of Duty. It does whatever the hell this game was trying to do better and leaves the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ranking/points system out of Single-player and has better multiplayer too.The only thing it really has going for it is Co-op, but there are again, better games for that too.Save your money.Edit: I finished the campaign in 3.7 hours. Far too short. The story was random and I didn't really know the purpose of anything I was doing for the most part. The only character that actually adds anything to the story is Paxton, he's also pretty much the only actual character in the story, Point man is a walking gun and the other female character from the first game (i'm assuming) is just kind of there, telling you the same exact thing over and over. Barely any unique Alma encounters or scary/creepy happenings that weren't random jumpscares (half of which are either just loud random noises or extremely easy to miss). Combat was typical of a F.E.A.R. game as Point Man, not a bad thing, but feels a lot cheaper due to the point system. Point system is downright intrusive and immersion breaking at times. Especially during the final boss. Recommendation stays the same, save your money.			"

 Short but fun coop FPS with horror elements, great controls and some minor flaws What is very important with regard to the third episode of the F.E.A.R. universe is actually that you should not fall for a direct comparison to previous titles. The present episode builds on and has its strong points when it comes to the coop element. Concerning storyline, concerning horror / scary moments, it might let you down or even disappoint hardcore F.E.A.R. fans. Take the game as it comes. Take it as a storydriven two-player coop FPS. A rare genre actually and what makes F.E.A.R. 3 definitely an enrichment in your library.  What I liked   Story driven coop FPS  Great, direct controls, good input feeling, good weapon handling  Two different playstyles which complement each other   End bosses and mech gameplay  Graphics are good and serve the purpose; very fluid performance  Some nice gore effects   F.E.A.R. universe / story is brought further  Coop horde survival mode  Level-up system  Plenty of achievements  Replay value together with a friend What I didn't like  It is short (5 to 6 hours) and gameplay feels a bit repetitive  It might get boring in a pure solo party  Blurry cutscenes which do not justice to a sharp display  Repetitive enemies  Horror effects are not scary enough for F.E.A.R.   Annoying connection issues with Steam  Dead multiplayer, so organize yourself well in order to play coop (neutral)  No 3D vision support. It has been abandonned im comparison to previous titles, which is a huge let down for fans of VR. It is overall a great coop experience. If you play merely solo, I would say there are plenty of better FPS. If you like the F.E.A.R. universe, do not get too much disappointed that the game is not that scary. But it complements well the storyline. Grab it together with a friend and have some hours of fun.  "

												SP ReviewDifficulty Played on: Fearless (Hard)FEAR 3 is a solid action game. It has times were the atmosphere is quite disturbing, but it is nowhere near as scary as the original. For those of you who have completed the original and all its expansions, this will be kind of a rehash of the 3rd expansion Perseus Mandate, only instead of fighting the merc group Nightcrawlers, you are fighting ATC corporate commandos. The story is of course different and like Project Origin, FEAR 3 ignores the original expansions  (Jin is still alive and such, Jankowski is not mentioned, but strangely your FEAR CO is still dead as he was in the Extraction Point Expansion)   You play as the Point Man from the original FEAR, and you fight Armacham as they struggle to cover up everything that went wrong in Fairpoint. You travel alongside your psychotic brother Paxton Fettel as you try to stop your mother Alma. Like I said, the game is a very solid action game, but it feels similar to many modern FPS shooters to were it feels like a shooting gallery. Enemies come at predictable patterns and can be easily outflanked and outmanuevered. You get rank ups for completing different challenges such as time spent in bullet time, weapon kills, and performing various manuever or enviromental kills. For each rank, you get a bonus in the form of more ammo, more health, etc. There are soul links hidden throughout the levels as well as dolls to get you additional XP. Finding them is not to difficult if you take the time to look around, but it kind of breaks up the actions a bit. This is similar to the original FEAR power-up system were you find health and reflex boosters. There are times in the game were it pulls you out of the action to deal with various paranormal entities in the game (The Creep being a noteable one). I did not find this scary as much as annoying getting routinely cheapshotted in a random part of the level. This does not serve to build much atmosphere as the monster itself is not to frightening and dampens the flow of gameplay IMO. There are some nice scary moments particularly in interval 3-5 when you go back to Fairpoint. The ambience here is great and the disturbing denizens bring back memories of the psychos from the Condemned series. These were my favorite parts of the game by far. Toward the ending intervals... The action became more tedious then rewarding. Using Power Armor was fun when it was first introduced, but it becomes fustrating during the Bridge interval. I should also point out that you cannot initially play as Paxton Fettel and can only play as him if you beat an interval as the Point Man. Paxton Fettel can suspend, possess, or use his psychic powers in a variety of cool ways, which does add something new to the game. There are two endings depending on who you beat the game with obviously, and Paxton Fettel's abilities do warrant a second playthrough. If you do play CO-OP through the whole game, whoever has the highest score determines the ending adding some competative play to CO-OP. Overall, the SP was fun and despite its hiccups was solid. The story wrapped up kind of weak and left me somewhat confused regarding the future of the series as well as other questions such as  why did Alma die after giving birth to her child, and why would she even consider Point Man a choice to be her successor. Paxon Fettel seemed to share her  goals and had a special link with her mother growing up. I also felt that it was a missed opportunity to not fight Paxton let alone Alma instead of Harlan Wade (who died in the first game). Alma has become quite an iconic horror figure, and it is a shame she went out with such a dull roar given how she laid waste to any and all who stood in her way  All in all, story aside, the game is definately fun and disturbing. Wait for a sale and pick it up.SP Score: 7.8/10Pros- Good gunplay- Great Atmosphere in some levels- Solid action game- Phase Commanders are a nice addition to the opposing force- Rank Up System is fun for completionists or people who like challenges- Multiple endings and CharactersCons- Becomes repetative- ATC soldiers aren't as interesting or threatening as the Replica Forces- Not as impressive of an arsenal compared to the previous titles- Some ingame events break up the action and can become fustrating- Though disturbing and creepy, the story is rather weak and the wrap up was phoned in- Monsters are nowhere near as disturbing or creepy as the original FEAR games- Missed opportunity: ending boss battle			"

Might as well been it's own title, could even had benefitted more from being so rather than alienating the fanbase.It is great fun in co op with a friend though! Controls are smooth, levels are allright, guns feel nice. Using powers, stomping around in the robot suits and tackling enemies is a blast. It's just not a F.E.A.R. game and shouldn't have been in the first place. It is more of a Call of Duty clone with failed horror elements, ludicrous story and idiotic dialouge.			"

												So, the question is....Would I reccommend THE 3RD game? I wanted too, I really did, but as the others have explained....It's not FEAR. If, I wanted to play BATTLEFIELD? I would've played that, instead of this duck-and-cover, generic, false advertisement this was. It's not a horror game, by any means. Blood and gore, doesn't mean you get to classify it as such. The others, got me to jump clear out of my skin. This one, didn't do so at all. The only reason, I kept on....Was the story. I wanted to know what was to become of them. Now that I know, I'm done. Difficulty, Fearless? Yeah, right. Gameplay was super easy. Oh, and I never used the ""duck-and-cover"" BS, unless....The game shoved me there, by accident. Nearly, killing me in the process. Also, Fettel should've had his own AI, and or vice versa, so you could've had cpu playing with you, and we should've had different choices in the end. (IMO) (Keeping the ending vague)]Instead, of trying to shove online play down our F3cking throats.			"

Many good ideas but it really doesn't get close to the first game or the second. It's just a sad ending for a decent game series.By all means, just play the first game and don't touch this garbage.

												3 OUT OF 5. recommend.but not very enthusiastically, and NOT for full price.  I really liked the first games, and the add-on packs. I was disappointed by this one. Definitely not up to the usual F.E.A.R level.  I don't like losing weapons after almost every interlude. , Also weapons have stupidly low levels of max ammunition. I wouldnt go into combat with only 150 rounds in my primary weapon, and I died quite a few times scrambling to try to find another weapon that had ammo.    The rendering isnt the most accurate. By which I mean you can be behind a barricade, and since this primitive game doesnt allow the lean feature, the only way to shoot from cover is to try to shoot over or expose your whole body shooting around.  If the center of a sandbag barricade is 4' high and the sides are 3' high, you cant shoot over the sides unless you aim higher than the center. You can SEE but you can't shoot. Also if throwing a grenade, the trajectory is as if you're tossing from your testicular level. I never carried 'nades by my 'nads. .        The worst part is the new ""Captain?"" who somehow craps out enemies relentlessly so that you need to try to kill him (and he takes a lot of killing), while dealing with attackers spawning from all around you.  THen at one point when you're low on ammo two of them spawn. They can appear anywhere, you cant escape them, so you die over and over.  Since they've gone the ever-popular console route, there is no way to save manually so you'll have to replay over and over to get past the areas where the enemy keeps respawning 5 and 6 at a time. One other criticism. When mapping keys, you cant reuse keys for different functions if in a mech suit or on foot. So you have to try to find keys you can reach easily and remember what they are, or remap every time you switch from armor to foot. Yes, it's a minor criticism, but most good games have a separation between vehicle key mappings and on-foot key mappings since you obviously wont be doing the same actions in a vehicle as you would on foot.          This isn't the worst game ever as some have said, it's just not fun enough to put up with the negatives. When the bogus (I""d use something else that has B and S in it) level got too high, I just stopped playing. I'll wait before buying for any future ""Day 1 Studios' games, checking online for HONEST reviews and not reading reviews posted by the seller.     TWO GOOD THINGS: the challenges to level up added in single player are a pretty cool feature,. Even better, and the reason for the third start, is that the long cutscenes in between levels ARE SKIPPABLE! (pay attention Fart Cry duhvelopers). NOTE: I didn't try multiplayer, just single, campaign.			"

												This game was so unsatifying that I wish I could get my $5 back. this has a terrible cover system that sticks you to walls when you crouch whether you want to or not. the weapon variety only give you about 7 to choose from as you progress. the game seemed like it should have been released back in '07 becasue thats exactly how it felt when i went through the game. this game only had about 4 enemy types and you blow through shooting galleries like it's back in style. this is literally one of the worst games i've ever played and the only reason i toughed it out was for the coop. even the coop couldn't justify a purchase. if given the opportunity to play it for free I would realize how trash this game it by chapter 3. Do Not buy this game. WB brings no quality to the brand nor the name. I hate wasting money on trash The Coop gives it a whopping .5 to the score2.5/10			"

F.E.A.R. 3 is surprisingly a really intense FPS game with a FUNTIONAL co-op campaign feature!The game feels like CoD where you just shoot at enemies with random pick up weapons and work together with the ai/co-op friend to get through the storyline.Apparently after F.E.A.R. 2, Alma somehow got knocked up AGAIN and is having a third f*cking demon child (even though she's dead?)...It just makes NO sense, the only thing thats fun is the gameplay/co-op but the boss battles and extremely hard gameplay RUIN this piece of sh*t just like 2 did.Meh, good luck.5/10 "

												The game is a good FPS game.It is not a good FEAR game.Just completed all FEAR games including expansions and this literally makes no sense. The story contradicts itself too much and all the ""fear"" in the series has been taken out. FEAR and its expansions were amazing. It ♥♥♥♥ed with my mind a good bit without using a ton of cheap jump scares. FEAR 2 was okay, there were still some scary parts in it and had a pretty good ending IMO. But FEAR 3... what? The ending is so confusing unless you make up something of your own. And as I said before, not a very scary game.If you're just looking for a good FPS game, I'd recommend this even though there are better ones out there. I do not recommend this as a FEAR game though.			"

												So ok, back to FEAR 3 :)It feels like you can put Alma into any game and it can turn to a FEAR :) Skyrim? Put her into a dungeon and vola, it is FEAR 4. You are playing Civilization, and your settler is moving and hoping to avoid a barbarian? All of a sudden Alma is there, and it is FEAR 5. You have Tales of Two Brothers? Make the Mom Alma and it is FEAR 3 :)After the lamest of the DLCs in the whole wide world coming with FEAR 2, this was not a surprise that this game sucked. But it was better than the DLCs for sure. Yes, it looks like COD with Alma, but what is worse is that there was an atmosphere in the first one and now it is all gone.I got all those games as a single bundle and if I knew, I would have only played the first one and put the rest down the drain.Play Dota instead of this :)			"

												You may ask: ""in what way this game differs from call of duty?"" At first glance the only difference is name. But wait! There's more:1. In COD you cannot play as a guy with some dank useless magic skills.2. COD wasn't ever suppose to be horror series. 3. In COD no one tries to continue already ended story from previous game.Thats all. In all other aspects this game's name should be ""Call of Duty: F.E.A.R. 3"".			"

												FEAR 3 Was unlike any of the other FEAR Games but that was good, in where it become more of a FPS THan a Horror game but you still get that scary feeling when exploring the atmosphere I've bought this on Xbox and PC And I'm still not dissapointed but it is a shame the Multiplayer has gone inacitve, but there are still groups andp eople that will paly with you on it what I'm trying to say is F.E.A.R 3 is a misunderstood game, infact it's a great game that deserves alot of credit. I haven't experienced one glitch or bug and I've played through the campaign twice the point is it's been years and my hopes of FEAR 4 Have sadly come to an end, I really hope one day FEAR 4 May come true but the Developers will need as much support as they can get, Overall this is how I'm gonna end my review, FEAR 3 Was a great game, great design, development and the Setting even sometimes got me a little depressed on the inside which made it all the more better. Great game, like all the FEARs would definately reccomend			"

												The engine feels similar to but more polished than Fear 2. 2 feels a bit generic and gunplay isn't as satisfying as this is. This one is smooth but still not perfect. The first game had♥♥♥♥♥♥that would make you jump out of your ♥♥♥♥ing seat when it came out back in the day, the 2nd game had much less scares, and this one is basically a pure action game. Taking away what made Fear great in the first place proved a bad idea and this is not a stellar game but is still pretty good. Solid mechanics and graphics make it enjoyable combat. If you can play only one Fear game, play Fear 1. However its presentation value is dated by todays standards so I would give this a shot also.			"

AS YOU MOVE FROM ONE GENERIC LEVEL TO THE NEXT, YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF OCCASIONALLY STOPPING MIDGAME TO THINK ABOUT HOW LITTLE SENSE THE STORY NOW MAKES, COMPARED TO FEAR 1 AND 2, WHICH WERE BOTH OKAY. FIGHT YOUR WAY THROUGH HORDES OF DEMONS, HOMELESS PEOPLE, (I THINK THEY'RE HOMELESS? I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW. THEY TAKE A LOT OF DAMAGE AND FOR SOME REASON ONLY SHOW UP FOR LIKE, ONE LEVEL. THE STORY NEVER REALLY CLEARS UP WHO THEY ARE, BUT IT DOESN'T CLEAR UP A LOT OF THINGS.) AND THE GUYS THAT YOU WERE WORKING FOR IN THE FIRST FEAR GAME BECAUSE, SCREW PROPER STORYTELLING, RIGHT? OH, AND I HOPE YOU DIDN'T PLAY EXTRACTION POINT FOR FEAR 1, BECAUSE THROW EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN THAT OUT THE WINDOW. EXCEPT FOR YOU AND NICOLAS CAGE TEAMING UP. AND HOLIDAY DYING. AND ARMACHAM THINKING THAT YOU TURNED ON THEM. THAT'S RIGHT, FOLKS, JIN IS STILL ALIVE, EVEN THOUGH YOU WATCH HER GET ♥♥♥♥ING MERKED IN EXTRACTION POINT. SO ANYWAYS: YOU AND NICOLAS CAGE ARE NOW BROS, AND YOU TWO GO AROUND KILLING STUFF. AND THINGS. THINGS THAT ARE NEVER REALLY EXPLAINED IN THE STORY. LIKE HOMELESS PEOPLE. YOU START THE GAME OFF IN A PRISON LIKE ANY GOOD SKYRIM GAME, AND FOR SOME REASON YOU HAVE A KNIFE IN YOUR CELL. YOU START OFF WITH A KNIFE. YOU ARE HOLDING A KNIFE IN YOUR PRISON CELL. AM I THE ONLY PERSON WHO NOTICED THIS? ANYWAYS. YOU FIND OUT THAT JIN IS STILL ALIVE, EVEN THOUGH SHE OBVIOUSLY DIED IN FEAR 1. SO YOU AND PAXTEENI FATALLOONEY SET OUT TO FIND HER. AND YOU DO. AND SHE LIVES, I THINK. AND THEN YOU BECOME A FATHER, AND NICOLAS CAGE GETS DOMED BY YOU. OH, AND IF YOU PLAYED FEAR 2, BECKETT GETS BLOWN INTO NOTHING BY (YOU GUESSED IT!) THE CAGESTER. THERE YOU GO, I JUST SAVED YOU FROM LIKE, FOUR HOURS OF THE MOST UNENJOYABLE CONCLUSION TO ANY VIDEOGAME TRILOGY, EVER.SERIOUSLY, DON'T BUY THIS GAME.I MEAN, ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, ALMA LOOKS KINDA HOT AT THE END OF THE GAME, IN A WEIRD ""YOU'RE-MY-MOM-WHO-IS-ALSO-CURRENTLY-GIVING-BIRTH-AND-COVERED-IN-BLOOD"" SORT OF WAY.

												Expect a true sequel to the previous two games, and feel disappointment.Approach it as a, say, side story made by a different team (which it is) and enjoy a solid, fun, action-packed FPS that is great both on your own and with friends.It's not scary, although it tries to be at times, but atmospheric enough to hide the very much arcady shooting mechanics. That said, these mechanics are fantastic, and as a shooter FEAR 3 is highly enjoyable and, to my surprise, easily replayable.It's also hands down one of the best linear coop experiences you'll have in an FPS in terms of variety and coordination.The multiplayer oozes with original and fun ideas which sadly made it into game modes that didn't last long before the community died out, but if you have at least 3 friends who are into this game, get them together and have a blast in the surprisingly innovative multiplayer.It's been 4 years but FEAR 3 remains a highly enjoyable experience to this day. And if, like me, you were slightly disappointed with how FEAR2 turned out in relation to FEAR1, the third installment won't be MUCH of a disappointment, but rather a great time waster - be it alone or with friends.Get it. Just remember that it's not what its predecessors were.			"

Posted: August 6, 2014
												Lets start this review with the truth. FEAR 3 is not a FEAR game at all and rather its a generic FPS. It was devd by Day 1 Studios, who handled the porting of FEAR 1 to PS3 and 360 (I originally played the PS3 version and have to say if memory serves it was a fine port that stayed true to the original game) and some games that were deemed mediocre when they came out and no one has ever talked about them since. So it makes sense that this game isn't a FEAR game aside from the name.The story is based off of what has come about from the first two games but unlike the spooky and mysterious tone of the first two games and especially the first this one just starts off goofy and borderline stupid. Something you get from a comic...book....http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Niles ....whoever hired this guy to write a story while looking at his resume is undeserving of the job they had at the time. I mean look at this guy, he wears facial hair and dresses like hes 30 or more years younger than he is and it looks terrible. He just looks like a manchild or something. Comic book stories are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, so now the FEAR story line at 3 is goofy and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like a comic book. 2 wasn't terribly great in anyway but 3 is just so so much worse especially story wise. Paxton Fettel is back and he is a ghost who helps you....this is literally the reason I don't read comic books. He dousn't help you like a beneficial all knowing god either, he just grabs you while your drowning and pulls you to safety kind of help. Steve Niles, if I ever end up near you...my fist requires a connection to your face.Gameplay wise its actually not fun at all. Its a generic fps so you just go through the motions of killing emotionless brainless AI enemies that don't follow any of the logic rules that made 1 so good. Flanking enemies dousn't do much when they are watching you through walls or just snap to you. Ammo is rare enough as to create a major annoyance and considering enemies soak up hits you find yourself with less than a magazine of ammo most the time. Its just like every other generic FPS game you played than forgot about and never cared about again. Enemies don't react quite enough to make it feel like your doing anything to them when you shoot them and shooting in general dousn't feel terribly good. The choice of weapons is very limited aswell, which in past games and especially in 1 wasn't much of a problem since shooting and all that felt excellent and still do. I was gonna throw in a COD joke since thats so trendy these days but honestly, this is more generic and worse than COD.Graphics are dated compared to the original or even 2. Overly demanding without a reason on higher settings. Its blurry diarhea in general. Sound is nothing special either, meh. Presentation wise the game comes off as if it was meant for multiplayer, I feel thats where it would shine in COOP where you and a bro arn't really paying much attention to the game itself. But honestly the way its all setup gameplay wise where one player is Paxton and the other gets the gun is really boring for one player or maybe both. Its just a crappy game. I want to call it♥♥♥♥♥♥but honestly its not really quite that bad. Its just generic and not worth much to me. It shouldn't be a FEAR game at all as its obvious they just wanted to use the name to bag bucks and screw the long term possible profits from future games.Everything from the old FEAR is here, but its not quite the same. Its like they looked at Fear 2 and tried to make it even more generic and casualised than 2. So now that makes Fear 3 miles away from Fear 1 and in the wrong direction with one shoe and no pants. Its just not a good FEAR game and a generic FPS in general. So basically its♥♥♥♥♥♥ but its not really♥♥♥♥♥♥because you can't tell if its♥♥♥♥♥♥because you will probably just get bored in an hour and just quit so you will never know if its really♥♥♥♥♥♥or just boring as watching trees grow in slow motion.

												The storyline in this game dosen't make a whole lot of sense in context with fear 1 and 2. The reveal that Alma is pointman's mother in fear 3 seems to cheapen the scares in fear 1 since you now know she is your mother and dosent want to hurt her own son. It also makes no sense that spooky pants cannibal Paxton Fettel would help pointman all of a sudden after being killed by him in Extraction Point. For the first time ever in a fear game you can only carrry two weapons.. In fear 1 you could carry 3 weapons and in fear 2 you could carry 4. Why regress back to two weapons? You miss out on all the fun guns since the ammo for them is so rare they arnt worth picking up. There are no longer any competitive multiplayer modes like deathmatch or capture the flag, however i'll admit the co-op is a lot of fun. F.3.A.R. isn't a bad game, it's just a bad F.E.A.R. game. Hopefully one day we will get Fear 4 and possibly play as Alma's new baby or another original character.			"

												FEAR 3 is particular in its way. Its most unusual feature consists in the fact that there's actually no fear - just anger, and irritation, and tiredness. It's not a thriller anymore - just a shooter. It still bears certain resemblance to Crysis, but I'd say that the latter is more 'paranormal' when compared to this certain game. And the bosses. sure, like in good old times. Damn, I hate bosses, really. (That was a reason why I liked the original FEAR, for instance.)What's on the positive side of it? Well, that's fine graphics, some new battle enhancements (such as the possibility to take cover behind certain objects and shoot from your hideout - previous FEARs lacked that function), and the gameplay fork that lets you play either with Pointman or with Fettel. And self-restoring health, yes.What's negative? Simplification, the common disease found in modern games. FEAR and (to some extent) FEAR 2 were more interesting; they were not merely about shooting people, there was room for investigation, for some exploration, and for some mystery. Now that's more trivial: here are some Armacham troops, here are you, you must kill them all and advance further. The same enemies, the same weapons... etc.My verdict - good, but not great. Worth giving a try, though.			"

												What can I say about Fear 3. I hope this is the end of the series. I really enjoyed FEAR and ever since it has been going down hill for me. Each subsequent release gets shorter and less scary. It is ripe with sequelitis. The story adds an interesting dynamic to the FEAR universe that leaves as many questions as answers. I played this through twice both in coop and we were able to see both endings, that is to say I won both times. the coop isnt that much co-operative but more competitive. you have the same goal in the story but the last scene Entirely depends on who got the most points and combos. The level design seemed to be wasted at times as many of the interval transitions were random and felt like half the game was Cut. a few levels were just there, nothing happened at all in them, again a waste. the graphics are astounding but why wouldnt you expect them to be. If you liked Fear 2 then this is right up your alley, but its lost what FEAR was. 6.5/10			"

												Now, back in the day i loved the first F.E.A.R game. It was the first time in my life when i genuinely got frightened by a computer game! Now, the second F.E.A.R sucked. It was bad. It was ""some FPS"", without a twist in any direction.So, i had no high-hopes regarding the third instalment of the franchise.I was disapointed - at first. ""Bang-bang-bang...oh, some attempt to scare me with blood and scrams...yeah right""...boring.But then, the game got the hold on me. First thing i noticed that enemies actually give you hard time. Seriously.The quality of the A.I suprised me completely. Allso, the atmosphere did eventuallyl win me over. I did felt ""dread"" trough the game experience.In short:It´s ""better than average / good"" FPS. Just don´t expect it to resemble anything like the first first F.E.A.R.This game is worth your 10€:s, if you need some easy entertainment for an evening or two.			"

												A great game on its own merits.  None of the FEAR sequels will ever live up to the original game's awsome atmosphere and intense multiplayer action.  FEAR 3 is the conclusion to the FEAR trilogy and while the FPS action is great, the single player story is boring and tacked on.  The events from FEAR 2 are just thrown aside and the protagonist from that game is as throw away as the plot for this game was.  I still recommend the game for the FPS action but dont go in for the story.			"

The last 2 hours of the gameplay I was just waiting for the game to end, and there is part where you are on a highway in a mecha or something for an hour, sounds awesome, but it isn't at all.I give it:3/10p.s. 3 points for available co-op.

												Ok, this one is a little bit tricky since i did not play this game to the ende. You could say i barely started and played it.Let's see.... if you've played F.E.A.R you know it's a horror shooter. A shooter that keeps you binded in front of the screen even though you really think it's creepy and fear is crawling up your neck. That's the feeling i so hoped for. But not in this game.I stopped when i was in a battle where infinite enemies came (i hadn't reached the checkpoint where it would end at that time), hasted around a corner and ...... saw a little ""Alma Puppet"" floating in the air and spinning around.I was like ""What the ♥♥♥♥?"" and stunned. First i didn't realized it was only a ""puppet"" and thought ""♥♥♥♥♥♥ now it get's creepy ...""And it got creepy. Nothing happened. So i walked into this ""floating, spinning Alma-Puppet-Thingy"" that was there and got ... 1000 Points!1000 Points for what?What is this♥♥♥♥♥♥doing in a horror game?That was the moment i closed the game, deleted it from my harddisk and it should never NEVER be played again.

												I really enjoyed FEAR 3.  Even more updated grafx from FEAR 2 and now with COOP!!!  It has online coop where you and a friend play in the FEAR universe and wreck havak!One player plays a Point Man (from FEAR 1) and the other plays as his brother, Paxton Fettel.  Point man strictly uses guns and slo-mo, while Fettel uses magic that can suspend your opponant while point man unloads ammo in him or Fettel can take over their body and play as the enemy which is pretty damn cool.Very short game in around 5 hours, but extremely fun in coop.  Battle it out and see who's the ""Favorite Son"".			"

												FEAR 3 (in my eyes) concludes the story from F.E.A.R.You take off where F.E.A.R. 2 stopped.Alma is Pregnant with a son from SargeantYou take on the character you played with in the first F.E.A.R, wich is Point Man ( Right ), and, with an extra character, that is also from the First One. Paxton Fettel ( Left ). Both of them can be controlled, but Paxton Fettel can only be controlled by Co-Op, and by the person that joins the other.Both characters are great fun to play.This game can still be spooky like the others too, I advise that if you want to get the scares first, play this by yourself, and to get the Co-Op Experience ( Changes some aspects into the game ), do it AFTER you've completed the game by yourself.

												By now, no one should expect new iterations of F.E.A.R. to be scary. While the first installment was the spawn of pure horror, Project Origin slowly deviated from the intense and moody atmosphere carefully crafted before. F.E.A.R. 3 returns to complete this leap, surprisingly finding itself on solid grounds.First and foremost, F.E.A.R. 3 is not a single player game. The campaign was designed for cooperative play. Expect some levels to be near impossible to beat unless played on a lower, and consequently less exciting, difficulty.As a mainly cooperative game, F.E.A.R. 3 is a shining example of how games don't need a competitive edge for replayability. Playing through the campaign with a buddy is a good experience, but it's in the various other game modes that this purchase becomes worthwhile.If you're looking for a horror game, you'll want to skip this. But, if you're looking for a thrilling experience to share with a friend, this instantly becomes a must-buy.Grade: B			"

												I liked first F.E.A.R. so much. It was a nice shooter with pretty scary atmosphere. I enjoyed F.E.A.R. 2 too. But this game is a dissapointment. Practically no more horror, just shooting, shooting, shooting... There are too many enemies in the game, you always have to shoot someone or something, and it becomes just boring. Several jumpscares during the whole process. If you want to be scared - go rerun F.E.A.R., or just play another game. Buy this only during the sale.			"

												F3AR attempts to tie up loose ends and combine the various story arcs of FEAR1 and FEAR2 into a cohesive narrative.The gameplay is heavily consolized, even when compared to FEAR2, and destruction  & environmental interaction have suffered as well. Gone are the brilliant dynamic lights and particles of FEAR1. However, the lighting and art direction are very well done.Creepy? Not at all. Fun? Pretty fun, yeah. Worthwhile if only to close off the story from the first two.			"

												FEAR 3 is similar to FEAR 2 on first glance however the key feature to this game which I think makes it the most interesting before even getting started on the plot is the new 'coop' gameplay.In this game you can play as the 'pointman' as in the first FEAR or as player 2 play as 'Paxton Fetel' who has the ability to possess enemies and take control of them from a first person perspective while being able to use everything the enemy has on them.This game has a points system even in single player and although its meant to be horror the elements of competitive gameplay features have emerged.

												I really, really wanted to like this game...but I'm ever so grateful I picked it up on sale.  The first thing I noticed was that the gun play was 'sedated', meaning that there was no punch to weapon impacts.  Any of the charm of the old school FPS feel that was present in F.E.A.R. and F.E.A.R. 2 is completely gone, and it's been replaced with a very putrid, banal color scheme ala Call of Duty Modern Warfare.Graphics quality is sub par.  Scares are nonexistent.  Story line is as cliche as it gets.  This is yet another franchise killed chasing after mainstream dollars that it never had a shot at getting in the first place.

Story Mode is propably 4 hours long its super fast...Story mode also include coop so there it little bit more fun if you are playing with your friend. Multiplayer has tons of modes and maps, like clearing waves etc...As you might know original F.E.A.R. was scary horror game, this is NOT although sometimes there is scary part...For me F.E.A.R. 3 is is the worst game in F.E.A.R universe, maybe because Monolith (studio which made F.E.A.R and F.E.A.R 2) did not make this game.Fail - 6/10			"

												F.E.A.R 3 is a game I got in a pack from the Humble Bundle and is the first of the series I have actually completed, this review will focus mostly on a co-op playthrough experience. I'll start with the positives, since there aren't many. Firstly, the Fettel (Ghost guy) character had some interesting powers and I thought it made him a little different to the Point Man character, which was good to make the experience a little different for each player. Secondly, the Mechs were fun to run around in for the little while you really had to use them. Now, on to the negative aspects. The game is incredibly repetitive, tossing the same enemies at you level after level, having very little weapon variety among other things. Another aspect which didn't work as intended was the cover system, as enemies seem to be able to hit you from behind the ""cover"" you can take with a key press, making it a useless option to even have within the game. The final negative point I need to bring up is the lack of horror, the game contains no real ""scary"" moments at all, making little to no attempt to include some of the creepy atmosphere you might have found in older F.E.A.R games. Overall, I'd say to give this game a miss. Its around six hours (on nightmare difficulty) of repetitive timewasting, with little to no redeeming factors or unique features. If you are looking for a horror game, try the older F.E.A.R games, if you are looking for an FPS game, there are plenty of better examples, if you are looking for a co-op game, try something like Borderlands 2 or a gamemode for Garry's Mod.

												The actual gameplay is alright, it's similar to the previous games. If you like the bullet-time, the organized AI, and the interesting weapons, that's all still there. But it's not scary anymore. You get these bright achievement popups and it's kind of silly. It also feels that there are fewer set pieces. It has a co-op mode but I've never tried it. You're going to end up playing the campaign for a few hours and that's it, so either catch this game on a deep sale or don't buy it.			"

												Well, it was a solid and fun game, but the lack of Monolith really hurt this game I think.  The first was a masterpiece, the second less so but still excelled.  I'm not sure what happened here.  The shooting was above average and the story falls apart (why was there such a heavy use of prerendered cutscenes?).  To add insult to injury it was a bit on the short side.  Perhaps they didn't know how to followup Project Origin and just decided to add to the oversaturated multiplayer arena.  Very Hollywood esque in the way this trilogy ending failed to live up to expectation.  I'm not chomping at the bit to play the multiplayer, but maybe I should to see if the new focus was justified.

I say nothing ladies and gentlemen, and it is very well shown the gifts passed down from mother to children. I have yet to play it on multiplayer but I am very anxious to try.

												Dont expect good old Alma fright scenes from the original F.E.A.R. it goes after its predecessor  F.E.A.R. more actiony less creepy, but this one compliments the lack of a good scare with good Coop mechanics, it has its spooky moments though.Its a good buy if you got a friend to play it with.

												I thought the 2nd game wasn't to great, but this game just feels rushed all around. No real tense terrifying environments. I feel like they spent more time on putting in mini-achievements for me to Rank up with and gain powers that I should already have.There's been nothing good in the FEAR series since the 1st game in my opinion. I feel like that game didn't have everything, but it made wonderful use of what it did have. Now it just feels like there's enough $$$ to add in other things that every other game's got...but they lost everything that made the game fun/tense/scary/etc. I don't care about the main character at all. I feel like he could have been anyone. Am I a good guy? Am I getting revenge? Also, if you plan on playing with a controller (360 controller) you will still get KEYBOARD/MOUSE prompts. No way to mod it in that I've seen, and I assume the devs won't be adding it in.I give it a 5/10. If you want a good game like this. Play FEAR. Then if you love it, try FEAR 2, and if you can stand that...play this.I do NOT recommend this game from my experience though.			"

												I played this game in co-op with one of my buds. I enjoyed this game's story and even some of the other modes like F*****G Run. The action wasn't too difficult and it was fun playing as the psychic. I should mention, however, the game was not scary in Co-op at the slightest.			"

												Fear3 is a very fun Co-op game. I kind of wish the game was a little longer than it is. After my friend Adam and I beat the game once. We found it kind of hard to want to play it again other than the fact there is Two different endings. I Have Not Played the First or Second Fear games, mainly because I get scared very easy and if I am too scared I almost always end up never playing the whole game. But having a friend there always makes the games feel less scary so Co-op made it easyer for me to enjoy the game. This is a very fun and scary game that was a lot of fun to play!			"

												Unlike the first two installments, FEAR 3 has a single player campaign that almost REQUIRES you to use the Slo-Mo function to complete it on the hardest difficulty setting.  The story was pretty engaging and the cut scenes were well done.  I was very surprised by the behavior of the AI and how they actually required some effort to kill, behind cover or not.  I tore through the first campaign option in one sitting and was well entertained.  I look forward to FEAR4.			"

												It's jarring how much F.3.A.R. is not a F.E.A.R. game. It drips of hubris, disregard for the franchise, and the fundamentals that distinguished its predecessors.The cyberpunk elements are just all but gone. The time to crate is about 3 to 6 seconds, whereafter the first level is room upon room of crates, and that sets the quality bar for the remainder of the game.The horror has switched from visceral and psychological to grotesque and gory. And the writing... It's subtle like a kick to the nuts.Not to mention the awards mechanic that replaces the hypo sprays. You get constant feedback about your actions, not unlike Bulletstorm's skill shot system. Of course,  they make no attempt to pretend that the system has any possible link to the world itself. Hell, they didn't even bother to keep the same key mappings. It's like the designers never even bothered to play F.E.A.R.			"

												As a long term fan of the F.E.A.R. series, I have to say, this game was really the opposite of what I expected it to be. Loved the first one and its two add-ons, thought the second game was terrible, and heard a lot of negativity about the third. It honestly reminds me of an updated version of the first game: Good firefights, intelligent AI that actually work with one another to try and take you out, and not to mention, the game over-all is just enjoyable.The only thing I personally dislike about this is the whole leveling system mechanic. Just seems dumb for the series. But, they did make it useful considering leveling up gives you a lot more buffs rather than just health and slow-mo increase.			"

												Let me just begin to say that I love the F.E.A.R. series but any fan of it knew that it was going downhill after the second game so its your own fault for expecting this game to be like the original. The actual fear factor and feel of the original games is not really there anymore. Granted some parts were pretty scary but seeing Alma didn't really scare me like it used to. It was more like looking at her in a zoo where she pops up and you get excited to see her as oppose to not wanting to  her to jump scare you or the horrible stuff she does to to alter the reality around you. This game is great as a FPS shooter game though. The action is pretty good and theres no stupid level of difficulty where you get frustrated and dont want to continue. All in all I have to give it a positive rating due to it being a decent shooter, but it doesnt really deserve to be a part of the F.E.A.R. franchise. If you can look past that then you'll enjoy it.

												Some people were a bit disappointed in this game because it lacks the scare factor of the first one. Though, it still manages to give a thrilling experience in some levels.Anyhow, F3 is basically action, and it does give the player a great experience in that sense. The most remarkable about this game is the re-playability factor (there are many games thay you enjoy the first time but then never want to play ever again), F3 will give you a different and interesting experience depending on what character you choose: Fettel=Stealth, Pointman=Direct action.The only thing this game lacks is mod support... or at least a good DLC.

												Thanks to trash for letting me play coop with him I found F.E.A.R 3 to be surprisingly good. There was no doubt in my mind that this game was crap from the very start till Interval 03 (the retail warehouse) where I decided to stop playing solo (you can even see via filtering my screenshots of where I stopped). But I've proved myself wrong ...Quite a coincidence, trash invited me to play with him in the level directly after the retail warehouse. I felt the same good qualities presented as in F.E.A.R 2 with amazing level design and atmosphere. I still feel like F.E.A.R 2 is the best out of the trillogy, but this one was very not bad (on par or better than F.E.A.R 1). Part of the reason could be the coop experience. I definately think it's a mandatory component in order to enjoy this game.I played the multiplayer a while ago, but if I recall ... I also enjoyed all the modes. Definately worth the bargain price I bought it for.			"

												Pretty silly and unsubtle but I played it with my wife and it's actually a very good co-op game. You can play the whole main campaign with a friend and each character has unique abilities that compliment each other, encouraging strategic collaboration and communication between partners. Of course it's impossible to have an impactful horror atmosphere when you're spending time with a buddy but if you adjust your expectations accordingly it's a good shooter and action game.I played the first game but didn't spend significant time with the second, but this was enough to help me appreciate where the story was coming from. That being said, you don't really have to play the previous games and can jump right into this one.I can't speak to the solo game but I imagine it's not as enjoyable as co-op. Get this and play with a friend for maximum enjoyment. It's one of the better co-op shooters you will find.			"

												I feel I should start by stating that I've enjoyed the F.E.A.R. IP for a long time. I played FEAR, its expansions, FEAR 2, and even FEAR 3 plenty on PS3, and I enjoy the series so much I chose to re-buy the entire collection on Steam so I can play it in its original format. I've played through FEAR three times, FEAR: Extraction Point three times, FEAR: Perseus Mandate twice, FEAR 2 five times, and FEAR 3 three times. 		Let me make this clear: FEAR 3 was not developed by the development team that made the other FEAR games; that was Monolith Productions. FEAR 3, on the other hand, was developed by Day 1 Studios. Sometimes games/franchises can turn out bad because of a sudden developer change, but sometimes the new developer works it well (like how 343 Studios did with Halo after Bungie stopped developing it). It all just depends on how the new dev team works.	It is in humble opinion that Day 1 Studios managed to screw up the entire FEAR universe across the span of a single game. I doubt this was their intention, but FEAR 3 is a mosh pit of disappointments, and it hardly ever stops going downhill. It's rittled with plot holes, has busted gameplay, and none of the oppressive atmosphere or well-paced scares that made the FEAR games so enjoyably devious. It's almost ALL uniformly gone.	Let's start with FEAR's thematic elements. For example, FEAR games have a theme of never taking the player's view away from the eyes of the protagonist; you always see what the character sees and nothing more, like with Valve's Gordon Freeman in Half-Life. On the off-chance you (and therefore the protagonist) see something that's not in front of your face, it's probably a vision induced by Alma. Another element to this theme is keeping the player (metaphorically) in the dark, leaving the player to explore the levels of the game to find more information (which was done by means of voicemail messages and readable documents) about their current situation. Other things about their situation are revealed to the player as their character sees them.	You protagonist was also silent, which was done so that the player felt as though Alma is haunting them, not the Point Man.  As such, whenever characters talked in dialogue scenes, your character is never directly asked a question, since silent protagonists can't answer them. Another theme was Intervals. Similar to the way Half-Life uses Chapters to break up its story, FEAR uses Intervals. Intervals were an important part of the structure of the game because they separated story divisions from gameplay levels, and these intervals were always a single word, ending in -tion (like Inception, Devastation, Isolation). These themes are completely dismantled in FEAR 3, as I'm about to explain.***THERE ARE SPOILERS HERE, AS I'M ASSUMING YOU'VE PLAYED FEAR, FEAR: EXTRACTION POINT AND FEAR 2***	FEAR 3 starts off in a prison; there is no explanation as to how Point Man got there. Paxton Fettel also apparently chooses to work with Point Man, even though there isn't any logical reason for him to do so. Point Man escapes from this prison (which is apparently in Brazil) and goes after his mother, Alma. What is already a weak plot start gets worse when Jin Sun-Kwon appears five minutes into the game.What's so ridiculous about this is that Jin Sun-Kwon is dead.	You actually hear her screams right before she dies in Extraction Point, then see her bloodily bludgeoned body five seconds later, with her blood all over the room, then get even more confirmation of her death by having the next loading screen say “Jin Sun-Kwon is dead”. Why Day 1 Studios thought retconning Jin Sun-Kwon was a good idea, I'll never know.	The plot doesn't get better. Intervals lose their importance as cutscenes tell most of the story, and the intervals (which are now blandly named “prison” and “store”) simply describe where the level takes place in. The interval names sound like they're still in development and Day 1 Studios simply hadn't thought of a real name for them. The cutscenes themselves are bad. In order to keep Point Man true to his character (I assume), Day 1 Studios kept him silent. This makes sense, but in nearly each cutscene another character will gesture towards Point Man or otherwise beseech him with questions, expecting an answer. Obviously, he doesn't give one. Because of this, cutscenes felt awkward, and most of the dramatic build-up was gone just because of how badly they were scripted. Many character deaths feel as if Day 1 Studios was just trying to create outrageous scenarios to kill characters so there wouldn't be any loose ends in the plot by the time the game ended. The worst example of this is very late in the game and happens to a protagonist from another FEAR game. The two endings to the game are mildly satisfying, but feel rushed. And with how badly the rest of the plot was executed, there was no dramatic build-up when the plot finally climaxed.**SPOILERS END HERE**	As for the atmosphere of FEAR 3, it's an opposite of what previous FEAR games did. FEAR games were about oppressive atmospheres, darkness, destruction, desolation, well placed scares and high mortality rates caused by an angry woman, coupled with a constant feeling of being hunted by said woman. In FEAR 3, environments are bland despite a graphical overhaul, scares are essentially nonexistent (and not scary when they do happen), and aside from two or three areas, there's a ton of light. The atmosphere is simply gone.	To make mattters worse, FEAR 3's co-op (which lets you play as Point Man or Fettel) is a train wreck. See, the game never makes it clear that this co-op is meant to be COMPETITIVE. The ending of the game is dictated by whoever gets the most points at the end of the playthrough. This is given by total kills, how you kill them, etc. While that's fine from a gameplay standpoint, the game never bothered to explain that it's competitive, which made many people perplexed at what ending they got, especially if they played co-op the first time through, because it felt arbitrary. If you're in co-op, why would you be competing to steal kills or headshots from each other? And how would you be expected to know that THAT affects the ending?That's not even including the fact that these points (which are accumulated by challenges) make the game feel like an arcade shooter, which only does more to undermine the atmosphere.The gameplay as Point Man is imbalanced. For example, some guns (like a pair of TMPs that he dual-wields) are incredibly weak, and their ammo drops are so rare and stupidly placed (why give a player TMPs if you're throwing a heavily-armoured mech at them right after?) that they're rendered useless. Other weapons, like the G3A3 assault rifle, are so over-powered that they render the game boring. The G3A3 is just the worst example: the G3A3 fires in a three-round burst, has a giant mag, barely kicks, and kills all non-heavy enemies in one-two bursts. From the point this rifle enters the game, the rest of the game can be watered down to aim the G3A3, use slow-mo, and massacre helpless foes. Playing as Fettel wasn't better; he's a god for most of the game, and even when I did have a challenge, it was because I was outnumbered ten to one, and still won handily.Finally, those points you accumulate do more than affect the ending; they help your in-game profile rank up. This is how (as Point Man) you earn more slow-mo, get higher mag capacities, or (as Fettel) get higher possession ranges/duration times. This means your character gets stronger as you play (which is cool), but it doesn't reset; it's permanent. I actually had no challenge in the second playthrough becauase I had tons of slow-mo and buckets of bullets all the way through.The only bright spot to FEAR 3 was its co-op multiplayer, especially the mode ""F***ing Run"", but it was just a nice distraction from an otherwise awful game. I sincerely hope FEAR 2 gets a REAL sequel someday.			"

												If you haven't played the previous F.E.A.R series then this ""F.E.A.R game"" might be enjoyable.Now is the 3rd time im trying to get back to this game and this time i was actually trying to not be so criticising and enjoy the game as a standalone not related to the actually previous F.E.A.R games that were good, i did not do good end ended up rage-quitting in massive cringe. The game by itself is quite a copy of the general CoD:MW type games and cheezy way that it makes me cringe while adding elements from the past F.E.A.R games to it. Not only is this the worst F.E.A.R game yet, it actually does a good job at destroying the previous storyline in the past games by bringing back two old characters and making them into some kind of co-op duo.If you have played the previous games I would recommend that you do not play this one, disregarding on if you are into the general MW-FPS genre of course.I would not be to judgeing if this game was a standalone from F.E.A.R and was called hmm.. ""Call of Spook: Cringe Edition"", but since it destroyed the F.E.A.R series for me im deeply disappointed.TL;DR: This is the general MW-FPS game with some added scooby-doo to it. If you liked the previous games then play this at your own risk.			"

												I played this game because I was in the mood for some scares, but ended up with a bunch of feels that I didn't know what to do with.Honestly, I see a lot of people poo-pooing this game for having a bad plot, messing up the series, blah dee blah...But I absolutely loved it.The strange love/hate relationship between the two brothers is something I found to be very tragic and engaging. Unlike the past two games, this one humanized Alma and Paxton to the point where I actually sympathized with them, and the final scenes (both ""good"" and ""bad"") left me torn. Both brothers have been deeply wronged, and it was fascinating how each one dealt with their past... With Paxton choosing vengeance no matter the cost, and Point Man choosing to not give up on mankind, which in turn gave way to mercy.Maybe I'm just a sap, but this game is going to stick with me for a long time.

												This one is pretty much like a Call of Duty game. Very fast paced, but also very repetitive. Lacks horror that the first two had, but includes more action and stuff. Still good if you like shooters I guess, but this one is probably the worst in the F.E.A.R series.			"

												77 minutes into the game and I just uninstalled it... what a waste of money and time.Where should I start? The game wouldn't launch.. so I had to search Google to find out that it has issues with DX11 and since it tries to launch with that enabled (no option anywhere to disable it), I had to manually find some switches and use those to launch in DX9....only to be greeted by a horrible narrow FOV (field of view), which on my 24"" 1920x1200 monitor looks like you are seeing the world through binoculars....Again I found a ""somewhat"" fix with another launcher switch which supposedly fixed the issue.... it was better but still....Then the gaming mechanics are horrible. Dare I say worse than FEAR 2 or even 1.Sure the graphics are a bit better, but at the end of the day, this is more of a ""demo"" with a story behind it, rather than an interactive game.Shallow shallow shallow.... I really enjoyed FEAR 1 & 2 but this one is a big disappointment.			"

												All in all, I can't see why fear 3 was considered a ""bad"" game.  It's still pretty damn good.  The hallmarks of the fear series are still all there, save for atmospheric scares.  That's mostly due to Coop -- Which was a fine addition, even if it did cost the game its spookyness.The guns are fun, Slomo awesome, Coop pretty hilarious.  The story is spot on, anyone who tells you otherwise is tone deaf and cant recognize a good story...  Graphics aren't toooo bad, but not up to snuff when compared to the other games' setting benchmarks for their time.  So, I'd still have to recommend this to anyone who enjoys the FEAR games.  It's quite a nice conclusion to the series and while it lacks scares, it still is quite fun and the story is still disturbing.			"

												This sequel to FEAR 2 is not quite as ""shocking"" or ""scary"" as the first two and ops for a more action/sci-fi story with occasional occult references. The SP on its own is decent, not mindblowing, but where it really shines is playing coop with a buddy. The SP is incredibly fun with a friend and it feels that the way the game was designed. Unless you've played the other two, the story wont make much sense either. Multiplayer modes arent explained very well, but they are fun provided you have people. Unfortunately it suffers from P2P Matchmaking, thus its technically dead. Great coop game if you have a buddy! 7/10			"

Love to see more of this game engine in the future (Despair Engine) I was amazed with graphics, interactions and physics. Unfortunetly this is basicly a single player game now adays and you'll need to find friends to play with, the online is dead. The game does have alot of replayability to it tho. Do to achievements and a fun scoring system for the campaign and fun solo challenges.Still completely worth the ride if you ask me.			"

												 am about done with this game. It has been fun. The graphics are very good, the sound is better than that. I have never liked games without real save game systems. Checkpoint saves are lazy. The voice acting was better than OK but repititous. The weaponry was effective even the grenades. Having to start each ""interval"" with no weapons was silly and I have never seen more helicopter/plane crashes in my life. As far as the FEAR factor it takes more than a game to scare me. The game does give ""starts"" but if you want to be afraid watch The Exorcist home alone at age 10. I like that I can play as Fettel if I want. Maybe I will. Point Man looks like the dude from Just Cause 2 or is it the other way around. Chin Ho or Kam Fong or whatever her name is has a nice butt but beyond that I am tired of games with chicks that disappear but call me on the ""phone"" regularly. Just so no one FREAKS !!!! Chin Ho is a character from Hawaii 5-0. I liked the combination of indoor and outdoor locations. The Mechs were OK but if there had been more mech I would have liked the game less. They make too much noise. The game has not crashed on me and I play it with all graphics pumped to the MAX. I captured different parts of the game using FRAPS. It is a practice of mine. There is full frontal nudity in this game. Overall I give it 8 out of 10. Will there be a FEAR 4?			"

Fast action & smooth gameplay is one of the reasons I can't stop playing this game. Paxton Fettel takes a little getting used to. At the beginning, I was more comfortable playing as ""The Point man"", but now Fettel is my favourite character.I havn't tried Multiplayer but CO-OP sounds cool.  I prefer Singleplayer for games like this.You should also try the rest of the games in the FEAR series "

												Lets face it, the only reason why people play fear is to get the crap scared out fo them. This game only gave me the chills once or twice. I might have jumped but if I did it was over something stupid. Fear 1 was great, scared the crap out of me. Fear 2 started to lose its touch but was still pretty creepy and had that awesome epicenter level near the end. Fear 3 is more of another crappy first person shooter but there is no online play except the co-op. If you like to shoot stuff this is your game. If you want a horrific experience play Amnesia or something because you will not get it here. The graphics are excellent which is the only good thing I have to say about this game.			"

												F3ar is a strange beast.  It tries to be a horror game and fails miserably by overwhelming you with cliche horror imagery.  It lacks the atmosphere to drive the point home even if this wasn't the case, however.  The game tries to tell a story, but it's so confusing and poorly explained that I still can't tell you what the point was supposed to be after finishing the game.  I couldn't tell you how it's supposed to be connected to the previous games either, other than the fact that Alma is here again.The graphics are pretty bland (though the blood looks good!)  The game is further let down in this department by motion blur that seriously blurs the screen even while standing still (you can disable this in a config file) and a poorly implemented depth of field effect that can't be disabled.  Levels are filled with lots of arbitrary contrived obstacles that detract from the game atmosphere and only serve to make your passage through the level slower.The gunplay in the game is pretty good, which at least makes it tolerable to play.  They also added a pretty cool dynamic crosshair feature where the gun sights will change color when pointed at an enemy.  The game also uses a cover system which you will die quickly without.  It works pretty well most of the time but occasionally it'll leave you aiming at a wall when you try to pop out.Fortunately the multiplayer is more interesting, though it is poorly explained and some modes are extremely difficult.  I doubt anyone's still playing so you'll need a group of friends to try it out.While the game tries to be something different, it just manages to be one of the most generic shooters I've ever played.  There's lots of better single- and multiplayer FPSs out there, so I'd recommend buying one of them instead.			"

(Even F.E.A.R. 2 might be better in this aspect, amongst others) The ending is botched at best.Where it shines would be the multiplayer: the new game modes are innovative enough, but lack one crucial factor: number of players.

MP seems dead though as I couldn't find many coop matches. The game seems harder compared to its precedessors and the AI is smarter and not dumbed down.

												This game is NOT scary... That said, if you liked F.E.A.R. and F.E.A.R. 2 because of their spookey elements, then you will probabally NOT like F.E.A.R. 3.The reason I like F3 is mainly because of the gameplay.  This game plays almost exactly like F2 does.  You get similar guns and you get another few levels with the MECH.  The gameplay is extremely fluid with really really cool special effects. One gameplay change that I liked is there is a lot less collection involved.I think I'm going to finish this game (currently around 50-75%-ish done), but so far it does not have a lot of reasons to replay it (other than the really cool feature of co-op mode, which I haven't been able to test).  Once you complete a level, you ""unlock"" Paxton Fettel (your brother) and you can replay the level through as him.In the end, if you loved the ""Slom-Mo"" killing-storm you can become, then this is the game you were waiting for.  For die-hard F.E.A.R. fans, be ready to be disappointed.			"

It doesn't capture the universe at all and feels incredibly forced. The art/graphics/plot and most certainly gameplay feel like an immense step back from the previous main titles. The forced co-op and scoring break the flow and immersion of the game immensely as they are constant reminders of what the dev's think you should be doing. Which seems to be reminicent of playing a house of the dead arcade shooter at times. This makes it impossible to take in what little atmosphere there is left. Personally very disappointing.			"

												As a horror game, Scares are short and mainly intended to be purely to shock. As a shooter, however, the combat is sublime. The cover system works fantastically, and the AI seem so intelligent and responsive. I would actually rank this above Call of Duty in terms of mechanics, as there's a much greater level of skill required and you always need to play strategically.			"

												FEAR 3 is pretty good. Not award winning quality or anything but it's enjoyable. The series has all but abandoned trying to scare the player at this point. It's mainly a supernatural shooter game with mechs in it now. If that sounds good to you, then there you go. The first two levels are painfully generic and could easily be a level in any Call of Duty game, but thankfully it gets a lot better and a lot weirder after that. I paid around 5 bucks for it and it took about 6 hours to finish. Pick it up on sale.			"

You have choices between going different directions, but you waste 4 minutes killing crap and running aside, then BOOM dead end, with absolutely NO direction in either way.Game is good, single player lacks narrative aspects and other aspects of storytelling.

												1) New to Fear ? If so, then start here. If you've played any F.E.A.R game before go on to section (2).     Fear is a combination of ""Bullet Time"" shooter and walking simulator. So there will be sections of each level that are arenas for gunfights, and then there will be areas that are you walking around while ""spoooky"" things happen. A few sections combine the two, but they are mostly segregated experiences.     I would reccomend you don't start with this game. Instead you should play FEAR 2 (which does everything this game does but better) or F.E.A.R (The original) because its has the best enemy A.I that you will EVER find in a fps game. This game was mainly built for Co-Op play. The problem is that these Co-OP systems are only semi-optional. They are very intrusive in the single-player experience. If you're looking for a co-op fps , this isn't bad, (though it is a bit buggy, but nothing too horrible). 2) I avoided this game for a long time because of the common wisdom that it just wasn't good compared ot the previous 2 games. That is true...butThe campaign is about *half* ish as long as the second game. You're meant to replay the game as Fettel (the ghost brother) . But his gameplay experience isn't so much different that you'd want to replay the game over again. The co-op and multiplayer systems are not bad,  but they aren't really anything special either. The game does have some very nice ""scary"" sections in some places. It also does *try* to provide a satisfying conclusion to the *story*Everything is in service to the multiplayer systems however, including the story. I could only see this being reccomended if you can get it for a very low price or if you want a decent 3-8 hour multiplayer experience. RECOMMENDED FOR CO-OPT ONLY			"

												There was no fear to be had in a game called 'Fear'. But then again, it has a lot of dots between letters (not sure how many exactly, hey, not everyone is into quantum mathematics or geometrical algebroids, ya know), and it also got a number (I think it's a sequel to the second one, which was a sequel to the first one, and the first one had a prequel about Uncle Fred and his good friend - a talking German banana named ""Leutenant Mattias Von Gruber""), so it has A LOT going for it. Just like my doctor always says: ""if you cannot handle something, just calm down and try not to choke on your vomit'. Which is a perfect analogy for this game and our life in general. 10/10.			"

												After the disappointment that was F.E.A.R. 2, Monolith decided to hand over the torch of mediocrity to Day 1 Studios, who in turn, dropped it into the ocean of incompetency, and drowned trying to retrieve it. The shooting components are noticeably weaker, nice to see the highlight of the series rammed even further into the ground. Mech sections make a return, because they worked so well in the second game, now a lot longer and more painful to plod through. The narrative is one of the worst I have seen, it started with an interesting premise in the first game and now has mutated into a despicable mess, devoid of any redeeming qualities. Giving the Point Man a voice and developing his character would have been a wise choice, engaging in dialogue with Fettel and expressing his thoughts and feelings about the chaos erupting around him. Instead we have Fettel trying his hardest to be unsettling and failing dismally, while Point Man gives him this hilarious look of contempt, which never leaves his face. I'm absolutely disgusted with how it ended, I didn't expect much but it really is abhorrent. As far as horror is concerned, Day 1 thinks that displaying butchered corpses and splattered blood in every corner is an effective way to drum up the scares, newsflash, it's not.A miserable way to end a trilogy.4/10			"

												After noticing that their price during the sale was FIVE DOLLARS, I actually had to delete my previous review because after playing F.E.A.R. some more and watching clips of it and Project Origin in another person's review, I felt I'd not explained ENOUGH just how much of a trainwreck this game is. The F.E.A.R. feeling is entirely gone. The gameplay is derivative and uninteresting unless you play as Paxton and they should have set it up like that in the first place instead of making you have to unlock him. Game looks, feels like dogshit compared to its predecessors.There, there's the whole game review. But that's actually less of the point. This game is like a cruel joke to those who liked the series. It has nothing to do with it gameplay wise. It's possibly the WORST ending to a trilogy in video game history. There's so much lore and story details that could make a person want to like it, but it honestly seems like the developer (not Monolith) was having a laugh at fans of the series. It literally feels like this was made in spite, and it's baffling considering Day 1 has made good games. They should have never made this game. They should have just made another Mechassault. For a moment, WB Games became the dumbest publisher ever. They reduced two silent, strong, badass protagonists to two uninteresting character, one of which has an extremely dull personality when he wasn't supposed to have one at all and one of which is a little ♥♥♥♥♥, making it seem like all of your actions were utterly in vain. Do not buy this game, even if it's really cheap, if you're a fan of the F.E.A.R. games and want to see how it ends. The only people this would probably appeal to are those who have never played any of the games in the series.Picture a clown laughing at you for ~5 hours before you whack your nutsack with a pool cue. Then, sticking your head up against the wall and don't STOP. DON'T. For another hour.That's F.E.A.R. 3.			"

												A well made game in all rights and I will say that this is an ACTION game before it is a horror game unlike its predecessors.Multiplayer is good and feels well made but again it is DEADThe games story mode is done well yet short with only a few hours of gameplay to run through yet the leveling and point system creates competition during co-op gameplay which two players control two polar opposite characters. Player one takes on the role of Point Man which is pretty much that, he is the point man who goes in head on and guns down enemies with an arsenal of firepower and slow-mo gunplay. Player two plays as Fettel the main antagonist from F.E.A.R.: First Encounter Assault Recon who plays more as a support class with possessing enemy soldiers and using them for a limited time to use their weapons and back point man up.On the topic of the story is that there are two endings one is for Point Man (good ending) and the second is for Paxton Fettel (bad ending) and depending on which player has the highest score at the end of the game gets their ending but the solo campaign is solely Point Man's ending7/10 points needs a bit more horror to feel fearful of Gameplay 8/10Story 6/10Controls 8.5/10Multiplayer (If you can find a game) 7/10			"

												Well i got this game in a HB, so if you got it in a good bundle or with a hight discount, this game is a good way to get some fun with some friend. Cooperative campaing will look crazy if you did not played Fear 2 & 1, but it's still a good FPS.I missed some puzles in the game, since each player has his own power and it could make the game way more rich than it is in that way. Not either me or my friend understood much of the story-line, but we both had a good time with this game. Also, I just was waiting for lot of scary things or monsters, and we just got a bit at the end, but it was really dissapointing if we just look at this.Anyways, I'd say that this game is higly recomended if you have one friend to share with and you like FPS.

												I bought this game on HumbleBundle for around five bucks and I even finished the game. Here's my final verdict, splitted into Pros and Cons :)Pros:- The graphics are pretty good- Cutscenes are very decent- In-game cutscenes are seamless- Animations are smoothly, like the enemies' movements- The game runs extremely smoothly, no framedrops etc- The blood and gore is decent and there (but there could be more)- Fights can be pretty intense. Hard, but fun!- The weapons have a great impact and it's very satisfying to decapitate a enemy with a sniper rifle.- There is no direct safe / load option, but there is a checkpoint system. Normally I absolutey dislike a pure checkpoint system, but here it's done very well! Thumbs up.- Some levels were plain awesome. Like the one in the store with all those TVs. Awesome! I also liked it that there were same parts of levels where I was able to mount a Mech. Nice.- Auto-regnerating health. While many players hate this, I welcome this. Because I'm a bad player with no skills, so thanks for that.Things I don't judge:- Levels are very linear. I don't mind linear gameplay as long as the action keeps going.Cons:- Very few (but great!) weapons- No akimbo mode for pistols (but for Uzis, somehow)- The ranking system. Do I really need this?- The story. I didn't followed the story of any FEAR game. Same here, never was interested in.- Enemies are invulnerable while animated (while they are jumping over a crate for example)- The boss battle in interval 8 ist plain boring.- Even for me as a bad gamer, the game seems kinda short.- What the hell can I do with Fettel after I unlocked him for a mission? I never found out, to be honest.- Same with those zombies. They're still standing after three close range blasts of a shotgun. What the hell? And those knive throwing idiots in the beginning of the game, I felt like I'm in BIOSHOCK.- I got REALLY tired of those moments where you automatically start to walk slow, your slomo-option is disabled and you know that something will appear. Bored the hell out of me.- The later levels, screaming Alma and always that babbling Fettel. I know, it's probably part of the story but it annoyed the hell out of me.In conclusion, FEAR3 is a good ego shooter which will serve a few hours of fun. Don't expect much, because you won't get much.			"

												Despite a too-short campaign and repetitive levels, FEAR 3 is still a good finale to one of the most unique first-person shooter franchises I've ever played. The weapons are fun, blowing bad guys away in slow-mo remains satisfying, the scares are lethal and the graphics are still quite impressive, with a lot of really beautiful lighting effects. When it comes to the FEAR series, one thing that I've always loved about them is how the genius of each instalment lies in the mixing of cinematic elements of Asian horror with 80s action films. Perhaps the series as a whole could be best described as The Ring meets Die Hard. However, this wouldn't do it justice, these games are well worth playing, both for the casual gamer and the survival horror aficionado. Hopefully someday we can see a fourth one!			"

												Just finished F.E.A.R 3 for the first time and have played through the whole series with its DLCs this game really ties up the whole story very well.I love how the story is told in the game and it is very nicely presented.If you haven't played the other F.E.A.R games I would recommend strongly doing so as you will understand more and also other aspects of the whole story.If you have played the other F.E.A.R games just be prepared that how you fight in the game is somewhat different. You still have your slowmotion combat but how you take cover and such is different. It is in a good way thou.Combat in the game is fun and good! The melee is fun with the powerslides. Pick your weapons and some are better for certain combat situations then others.As I always do I recommend playing on Fearless difficulty level to get the best enjoyment and challenge in the game. It isn't that bad since I made it through ;) Dying isn't that bad!I do recommend this game and do play the other F.E.A.R games in the series before is my recommendation. "

												If you play this game, please play it with a friend.  It was FANTASTIC to play it with someone I know.  The game is quite short if you go straight through the campaign (5-6 hours), so I would recommend getting it on sale.  This game has jump scares, it has camp, it has a terrible pun.  It was SO FUN that I have a new love for the F.E.A.R. series.  I was cracking up throughout the game on voice chat with my friend.  If you play it with someone you know, I think it has some good replayability.The co-op is alot of fun!  Very different play styles depending on if you are Point Man or Fettel.  There are also opportunities to compliment one another as well as opportunities to compete against each other.  Seriously, I had a great time with this game.			"

I'd say 6/10 but only as an ending to an epic trilogy.			"

												This game hasn't really improved upon F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin but is still a fun game to play. You basically play as Point Man, whom was the protagonist in the first F.E.A.R. game that was considered to be the best shooter of 2005. This game starts off by you being tortured in a jail cell by two gaurds and you have to escape to find Jin Sun Kwon. Here's where the plot problems come into play. The game doesn't tell you where or how you got to where you started, it just puts you there out of the blue, with no relation whatsoever to extraction point.The gameplay is like a basic first-person shooter with mechanics such as taking cover and jumping over obstacles. It's good but I hardly used it at all since how that controls is just hard to get used to. You also posses bullet time which allows you to slow down time and shoot at enemies much quicker and easier. This makes the game realitvly easy in the beginning but you will be greatful that you have it since the game gets realitvly hard and frustrating near the end.The major complaint I had with this game was that the game's difficulty is completly unfair when playing solo. Here's what I mean by that: When you have to fight the two commanders near the end of the second last level, you will die probably 10-20 times at least untill one of them gets hung up on the wall while you kill the other. Seriously if it wasn't for that I would be stuck here still trying to beat that part; it's just impossible.It's not a very good game but it's still a good game so I would still recommend you play this.

												I just finished this game after having it in my backlog for quite a long time and honestly part of me wished I didn't play this game at all because of how much I love F.E.A.R and F.E.A.R. 2. Don't play this if you loved the previous F.E.A.R. games, which sucks to say, but this is not the experience you'd want for a sequel.Performance/graphics:Performance is ok in the sense that I was able to play at 120fps most of the time, but did have dips on occasion, There aren't as many graphics options compared to the first two games, but there are still some. What really bothered me was the forced Motion Blur the game had and the only way to turn it off is via an options.cfg in the game's local folders. Not too big of an inconvenience, but definitely something they should have added in the game's options menus especially when it was toggable  in the previous two games. Graphics themselves are ok, still good looking, but honestly F.E.A.R. 2 looks way better, at leas to me.Combat:F.E.A.R. 3's combat is 100% different compared to the first two. Obviously they're all FPS games, but the actual weapon combat(aiming, weapon firing/response, etc.) is completely different and I don't think it was for the better. You're limited to only two weapons at a time, no medkits/armor pickups(regenerative health), but there is still slow-mo and vehicles in the game. Also there are still around the same amount of weapon variation in the game compared to the first two, but you're just limited to only two at a time which I think is a huge negative, but might be because of the co-op mode the game has, so to balance it out.Atmosphere:Still ""scary"", but compared to the first two games F.E.A.R. 3 is more action than horror and that's bad. I'm not sure if it was because of the co-op addition so they couldn't account for player positioning for jumpscares or scene build ups correctly, but the games are suppose to be scary, but this game probably only scared me once out of the four hours I played it.Story:I appreciate the closure the game has given me for wanting more after completely F.E.A.R. 2, but I wish I didn't experience this closure exactly. The game has two endings, one considered ""Good"" and one ""Bad"", but I'd say both are pretty bad. I won't post spoilers, but if you love F.E.A.R and F.E.A.R. 2, don't play this.Price:This game is not worth $19.99, not even close to that. I got it for $4.99 a while back and that's honestly all I would feel comfortable paying.			"

												Altough I recommend, be warned. This almost feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cousin of Farcry, the Farcry that was hidden under the sofa from the neighbours. I would only suggest this for big fans of the series.Graphics:- Good, rich environments and very varying techniques. I thoroughly enjoyed the visual quality of this game. But it clearly looks like a console game. The performance is good, but I did have to drop my Antisotropic Filtering slightly which baffles me?Sounds:- Good, realistic and believable but suffers from the same problem as Fear 2 in that the music is cued and sometimes kicks off in strange intervals during a fire-fight.Gameplay:- This game is not scary. It is deviod of scares and just doesn't have the same element of fright as 1 & 2.- The environments are varied, and are done justice. Altough I do not like the fact that the game starts in Brazil, it was believeable.- Not all of the guns are useful, I hated the Combat Shotgun and only used the pistol when I was forced to. SOme weapons were absolutely useless.- The AI sucks, it seems to have gotten worse as the series has progressed.- The game is riddled with FMVs. FMVs? Is this the 90s? Is this Final Fantasy? I don't want FMVs in my action-shooters, I want action.Story:- Load of crap. It feels like multiple people had their opinions and ideas added and removed as the story progressed and the full view was just hard to follow and uninteresting.- I do like that they included The Point Man, Paxton Fettel & Becket, but the weaving of the characters together is so forced it feels like it's being helf together by super-glue and band-aids.- The protagonist (The Point Man) is so unlikeable it's ridiculous. He looks like a serial-killer and acts like someone who would NEVER have been accepted into the F.E.A.R. operatives in the first place.- The game starts in Brazil. Brazil? of all places, why Brazil? It's so far removed and misplaced. Guantanamo Bay, I could still believe, but a random slum in Brazil? WTF?			"

Unfortunately it all went downhill from there.In the original game your character was a heavily armed badass trading punches with the bad guys. No BS boss battles or monster closets, just heavies and well co-ordinated squads of replicas. This time even the bullet time sucks. The AI is pathetic and the baddies are lame. Not scary or creepy at all. Nothing ruins the atmosphere more than having the game pop up letting you know that you won an achievement.Your better off playing something else.

If it is in a bundle that you are buying to play through the original, or you want solid 2 player co-op campaign, or you want a shooter campaign that is genuinely different from COD knockoff BS (after level 1), go for it.

												I'm going to start off by saying that I loved the first F.E.A.R. and all of its expansions.  Never had I been so scared of a little girl in a red dress or so saddened in a video game by learning what was done to her.  The sci-fi elements were futuristic, but still grounded in the feel of being the kind of thing a military black ops unit would keep hidden from the 21st century public.F.E.A.R. 2 just didn't have the same punch with either the atmosphere or the gameplay.  I remember the slow motion horror  when the first mechsuit came bursting through a wall at you in F.E.A.R. 1.  Then F.E.A.R. 2 had them shooting down from space.  Just felt like going overboard to me.Then we have F.E.A.R. 3.  The sense of horror, that fear of the unknown that got triggered whenever the lights flickered.  You just don't feel it anymore once you realize that Alma is pretty much on your side at this point.  This is quite simply a run and gun game.  In addition, the sci-fi elements border on Star Trek with enemies teleporting in via portals.  And changing over to that regenerating health model just makes it feel nothing like the first F.E.A.R.  The only thing that kept me playing was that I've wanted to know how this trilogy would end from the get-go of F.E.A.R. 1.I wanted to like this game.  I hoped it would undo some of the minor snafus that came up with F.E.A.R. 2 and give us a dark and unsettling finale to one of the best horror games I've played.  Not a total let down, but a let down none the less.			"

												Fear 3 was an ok game, but a little dissappointing at the same time. It was more like a standard shooter than the previous games survival horror. That might be because Alma doesn't pop up and surprise you much this time. I can't say I was that scared in any of them though. On the other hand, I did like that they made the campaign co-op, and fit it in nicely with the storyline. In the end Fear 2 is still my favourite, but number 3 is still worth a look.			"

												Fantastic FPS, ""Horror"" game, with a complete storyline of 3 games so far, F.E.A.R. 3 makes a 1. place, on my horror shooters, because of the Co-Op campaign, with tons of multiplayer modes, to enjoy the game. It has a 5 Star storyline, and if you like story lines, with action, horror, sorrow and multi-ending games, you should play the F.E.A.R. series. Trust me, it's worth it.Co-Op: The Co-OP is fantastic, I am missing the feature, to set wich character i want to play, in Co-Op mode, instead of the host only getting to pick. Over-all, a good FPS-Horror game, with a 5 star story line, and can, without a doubt, be recommended.			"

												It's been 10 years since I played the first Fear game but I remember liking it. I only played a demo for the second one but it seemed cool too. This third game is something else. The story is just non interesting and at least half of the time I don't even really know what's going on. The gameplay is really just:Take coverPop up and fireTake cover so health can regeneratePop up and firerepeat until shooting gallery is emptyMove forwardRepeat shooting gallery processrepeat repeat repeat until level is overIt's a competent shooter, sure. I don't really know why it used the Fear name though. I guess if you like the Fear series and you wish it was actually Call of Duty then you'll dig it. It's OK but I wasn't really looking for Call of Feardy.I hear the multiplayer aspect is cool but I don't care about that stuff. I probably should have passed on this game but it's not completely horrible. It's just ""meh"" really. The FOV needs to be fixed right from the get go. It's pulled in way too tight. There's no option for it either . You will need to edit a config file. Also the graphics are muddy. There are no hi-res graphics to be found anywhere. This game really isn't that old. Sheesh. Typical console port.			"

												Despite all the hate coming from people, F3AR is enjoyable in its own right. Granted, gameplay was streamlined too much compared to the sequels that it feels too much like Cowadoodee (but not completely).For one, medkits are gone and regenerating health is the new heals BUT unlike COD, regenerating health can bite you in the♥♥♥♥♥also as enemies do like to punish you hard (as in if they're not understrength, they WILL push towards you while trying to regen health). So no medkit abuse to get out of a fight where you're guaranteed dead.Gunplay is a bit generic, but still enjoyable. You do have a destructible cover system that allows you to shoot from side to side, allowing for limited tactical gameplay. Its not original, but workable enough. The martial arts that the first game had and the second game downplayed, are now gone, however, which is a huge damn shame, because ♥♥♥♥ knives, I wanna punch and kick every person I can find like John Woo from hell.There's also a unique feature in F3AR in that you can play as the pointman's sociopathic brother: Paxton Fettel. On his own, he can only throw out telekinetic bolts and levitate thiungs and can't use guns. He can, however, posses certain enemy troops for a limited amount of time, allowing you to have your meat puppet wreak havoc on the enemy lines before doing it again. He can also make people's heads explode like in Scanners. If you can find a friend to play Co-Op with, the prospect is quite good.The atmosphere (after the first level) has to be one of the best features of the game. You do feel like in an apocalyptic wasteland after a psychic/nuclear disaster. It's not ""depressingly beautiful"" or ""adrenalin-pumping beautiful"" but just creepy. The more you progress, the more you see how horrifying Fairport has gone down under. People are crazy. Cannibalistic crazy. And the locations you venture through will reveal how high the level of crazy went into this place.As for difficulty, F3AR does have it. ATC Black Ops and the Replica troops are tough that they usually take a few hits to take down, have a kiiiinda decent set of tactics. Though, the AI does kinda shift from Competent to Call of Duty at times, but most of the time, they remain competent and will give you a run for your money. Cannibal AI is not that far from your everyday zombies from L4D and the likes, but they will try sneak attacks as much as possible.As for multiplayer. Its pretty much dead. Unless you have friends. Its dead.Overall, F3AR might be a bit shifty with its price of $10, but is a definite buy if its on sale. It'll give you some decent enjoyment for its price.			"

												Oh my, I couldn't go far in this game.  I was a huge fan of F.E.A.R. and F.E.A.R. 2 - Those were very good games.  This 3rd installment seemed to lose track of what made the first two games enjoyable and unique, and reduce them to a strange extrapolation on the franchise.  To be honest, I didn't play the game long as the game's intrinsic departure from the overall feeling of the original two games was so dramatic that I couldn't get into it, and uninstalled it.If you really liked the first two games, I do not recommend this one.  If you haven't played the first two and love FPS games, perhaps get this when it's on sale.			"

												A F.E.A.R misses the point from the original games. What a mistake!GameplayI can see why people would find it fun if this is the first time they are playing a fear game. It has a lot of action and is overall an average shooter. What made the first game great is gone in this one. For an FPS the game is boring and it is just another genetic FPS game. It overall fails to deliver its own name FEAR!You can play as two different characters this time. One with awesome supernatural powers and one without. To unlock the character you have to complete it. No one is playing this game twice. The levels are boring and I cannot differentiate the levels from eachother. They are mostly based around small corridors and in general just lazy game design.GraphicsThe graphics are heavily outdated and looks awful for a game that came out in 2011. Think of Skyrim for god sake. It looks like the graphics from Doom 3! There's almost no details in the levels. Pathetic! It has this dark grainy Instagram filter on, which you, by the way, cannot turn off. Speaking of things you can't turn off is the mouse acceleration and motion blur.SoundThe sound is pretty good. The music is scary as it should be. The voice acting is not best, but it's alright. The ambient sound is pretty cool too. VerdictThe game is incredibly frustrating and is overall not a good game. If you're thinking about buying this, please spend your money wiser.			"

												This is a dumb game. It has a stupid story, a stupid narrative, a weird exp system, and all sorts of weird ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that just seems at odds with the franchise. I love it though. The gunplay is by far the best in the franchise with responsive, accurate, and powerful weapons.  The combat is a ton of fun as long as you avoid playing it like a cover shooter. The cover system stills allows you take damage behind cover, so it's an ultimately pointless mechanic. However the enemies die fast enough and your weapons hit hard enough that sprinting between cover and jumping over tables while enabling bullet time makes you feel like Neo. For reference, here's how the games rank:Best Combat: F.E.A.R.F.E.A.R. 3F.E.A.R. 2Best Gunplay: F.E.A.R. 3F.E.A.R. 2F.E.A.R. 1Best overall gameplay: F.E.A.R.F.E.A.R. 3F.E.A.R. 2Best Plot/Narrative:F.E.A.R. 2F.E.A.R. F.E.A.R. 3F.E.A.R. is still the best in the franchise, but F.E.A.R. 3 is so much fun i can't help but recommend it. Game multiplies its entertainment value by a factor of 5 when you finally unlock the overpowered monster that is Paxton Fettel. Overall F.E.A.R. 3 is a bad game that is a ton of fun. Highly recommend.			"

												Compared to FEAR 2 this game is quite a bit more fun, mostly because you can play with a friend.  Enemies are about the same as the rest of the series, albeit with more giants and less ninjas.  Guns are about the same too (although reticules are less useful by my guess), environments are a bit nicer overall.  The game is more gory, and not really in a way that adds to the game much.Story is about par for the course, I guess a little more solid this time around.  Partner merchanics work well, cover mechanics are fairly unnecessary, teammate mechanics are functional and useful.  There is a little bit of a level-up system but it doesn't really retract from the game.  You get more slowmo or special melee attacks, thats about it.I got it for $5 digitally from another site (CD activated on steam).  One playthrough was 5 hours.  It has some multiplayer competative / cooperative deathmatch and monster-wave survival modes I think, I haven't played those.			"

												Had this been it's own action game, it would have been a high recommendation from me. But the game is called FEAR not SHOOTY-EXPLOASIONS and this game has very little scares (blood dripping upwards? Really?!). Also the campaign is way too short. Took me 5 hours to finish and that's including many ♥♥♥♥-ups. Sure there's co-op but the setup is so bad I swear it's impossible. I tried being invited, inviting, and waiting for the friend and neither worked. So no co-op from me! There's multiplayer.... oh wait, it's a FEAR game, the franchise where multiplayer quickly dies! Sorry but this game isn't worth the money.			"

Bad gameplay decisions, totally dumb AI and even not that impressive graphics with no scares just run and shoot.But after that 1,5 hour mark game introduces really interesting environments some good atmosphere moments. Also I think the ending that the best out of 3 franchise games. Not great, but better than previous games.If you are not familiar with previous games, skip and don’t waste your time. If you like previous F.E.A.R games and don’t have anything to play it might be worth a try. "

												Alright, let's get this out of the way: F.E.A.R 3 is NOT a bad game. It does what it does in a competent manner and there are some elements of it that are actually pretty good such as some of the art direction. But is it a great game? Not so much. While the core combat is decent, it is nowhere near the standard that F.E.A.R 1 introduced and F.E.A.R 2, to a extent, continued upholding. Guns no longer bite massive chunks off walls, particle effects are WAY downscaled and everything just feels a bit...off. But again, F.E.A.R 3 is not a bad game. If you want to see how the story ends or just want to play a decent FPS to tide you over until ""the next big thing"", then F.E.A.R 3 might just be worth picking up...during a sale.			"

												The combat was taken in a more modern direction in this game, largely in part to regenerating health changing the style of everything. I wouldn't consider this bad or good, just different. The asymmetrical co-op campaign is pretty fun, and also adds some extra replay value for solo players, as completing the campaign unlocks playing it as Fettel solo. There's also a host of unique co-op and team based modes to keep you playing longer if you've got pals to mess around with.			"

												FEAR and it's sequel were really good games, both managed to be scary in their own way and have some really fun shooting in it. Heck, FEAR 1 has some still impressive AI behind it. FEAR 3 is a dumbed down shooter, player 2 gets some different mechanics if you're playing co-op but honestly the game is weak all the way to the lame last boss. I'm not being overly harsh either, I've played some dumb shooters and enjoyed them but FEAR had some bite to the combat, this game frankly doesn't. You have regenerating health...and a cover system, seriously that's how far they've dragged this game down. Deadspace 3 was pretty butchered, it was at least a fun co-op experience this game got pretty dull, the good news you won't be bored long, it's less than 5 hours on hard mode. The game has some neat visuals but that's about all it's got going for it. They just straight up seemed to forget to add any actual horror in it. It has none of the jumpscares of the previous ones, the tense atmosphere. The final boss was as generic as you can get, without spoiling it? Big slow monster beyond a 'fence' that you shoot at chipping away parts of it till you win. I don't know what they're bragging about on the steam page, they didn't bring any of the hallmarks that deliver anything from previous FEAR games. If you're a fan of the FEAR series? Don't bother, this could have been a totally different game they renamed to FEAR and I'd believe it.  If you're just a fan of a good shoot-y game? STILL don't bother, there's better games for cheaper. If you got this in a bundle? Gift it to someone.			"

												Not terrible, but really damn short. Not a lot of variety, the mecha parts are pretty short and while firing the weapons on them is satisfying, the movement in them is janky as hell. All in all, basically a case of ""Just get it out as quick as possible so we can cash in on the multiplayer shooter dollars."" btw, the multiplayer is kind of deadish too.			"

												FEAR 3 is a fairly good installment into the series but it isn't scary, not at all scary. What it lacks in a scare factor is makes up in its disturbed storyline, since its mainly focused on the ""brothers"" and their past, what they went through ect. I feel that it was pretty disturbing at times. Visually the game looks good, and it will play on most modern day computers so you do not need a fancy graphics card, which isn't a bad thing. Day 1 Studios has made a good installment into the Fear series, I do think if Monolith developed it, they would have spent more time, and would have done a better job. As for game play Fear 3's strongest feature would be the co-op mode. Which of course you can play with your friends, one thing I didn't care for much would have to be the little Achievement boxes -so to speak- popping up every five seconds to let you know you did something unimportant. 8 out of 10.

												F.E.A.R 3 is absolutely a blast to play but does fall short from being a true ""F.E.A.R"" title. For the hardcore fans, they'll be disappointed with the fact that the scare factor isn't as great as the previous games. But don't let that keep you from playing Fear 3 because as I stated before, it's an absolute blast to play as a shooter and I highly recommend it to those that love FPS games with action-packed gunfights.

												You know, this is not a terrible game. Good graphics, decent action, and I absolutely must compliment the audio people for that part where you have to fight with your hearing impaired. That was cool.But, when you come from the previous FEAR games, you surely expect something different than this. The game mechanics are now ""modern"", that is, ripped from COD:MW (the favela level makes the inspiration even more obvious). With the regenerating health and hand-to-hand combat, the once essential slow-motion system became almost unnecessary. The very mood of the game has changed, lacking that oppressive atmosphere that made the original FEAR so cool. Even Alma, who previously had nuked a city and sexually abused a soldier, now much more tame and passive. This game has traded true edge and psychological horror for cheap scares and gore.Worst of all, the endings are very unsatisfactory. You won't get much closure here.Ultimately, FEAR 3 was some decent fun, but definitely lacking. It's not good enough for me to recommend, but not bad enough for me to tell people to avoid. It's just average. And after two excellent games, it should have been much better than just average.			"

Not to mention the Single Player game is so obviously constructed around a co-op experience that any one playing it on their own ala previous games will find them selves with a large mountain to climb in regards to enemy numbers.Such a shame. 5/10			"

												It's nothing like first and second FEAR games, it's more COD type shooter with little horror (mostly jumpscare). You can feel and see how clearly this was made for consoles, the menus and controls are slow and clunky when using keyboard and mouse, with FEAR 2 they at least tried to make a good PC port but with third game they didn't even try. Usually I play FPS games with keyboard and mouse, but FEAR 3 is much more enjoyable with XBox360 controller, the controls are much easier to use and even the targeting is more responsible with gamepad.The story continues right from where the second game ended and this time you can even play as Fettel after completing the stage. FEAR 3 is fairly easy just like the second one so I reccommend to play on Fearless if you are looking challenge. Also this time there is some kind of leveling system like on the COD series, where you get bigger ammo clip, longer motion control, more health, etc. after getting enough points from completing small type of challenges (like get 10 headshots, use motion 10 times and so on). The main game is short, only around 5-6 hours to complete, but you can play the levels as Fettel and there are some colletable items, so these will make the game little bit longer.The granades are useless they have small area of damage and don't do much damage even when exploding next to the enemy. There are some walls that are scripted to break down, but anything else will not move even little bit when blasting them with missile launcher, game like this needs destructible environment, you can shoot oil and other spesific cans that will explote when shooted but it's not enough for a game that was made 2011.The multiplayer seems dead, I'm not sure if they have shutted down all the servers, but it didn't find any games.If it's on sale or in bundle I can reccommend it but I wouldn't pay over 8$ for it			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 follows directly after F.E.A.R. 2 but has very little of a connection to F.E.A.R. 1 since certain events never happened due to the Monolith and Vivendi timeline of F.E.A.R. being a bit different. In short, it's two different story lines, but none the less a good idea to play the predecessors in order to have an idea of what is going on in the game. The developers did an excellent job when it came to playability. I've spent hours playing this game over and over again, doing achievement hunting and completing the game in Co-Op mode (probably the best feature) with my friends. The greatest disappointment (in my opinion) is that fact that they moved away from the horror elements of the game. Don't get me wrong, there are a couple of scares in the game, but it's not nearly as intense as its predecessors. This shouldn't discourage you to play the game, because what lacks in horror the game makes up for in playability. A few multiplayer modes have been added that makes it so much fun to play. Like its predecessors, I highly recommend that you give this a shot, it's a great game with a great story line!			"

												I had a negative review of this game for a long time... having replayed it I'm changing my mind.I hate this game for the sin of not being FEAR 2. As sequels go this is terrible. It brings nothing of the tension or atmosphere that gripped me throughout the astonishingly brilliant FEAR 2... it then uses achievements constantly popping onto the screen in bright colours to kill any residual tension or psychological edge it might have. Which is all extremely irritating and disappointing in comparison to the game it is meant to be surplanting.BUT...Forget that this is meant to be part of the FEAR franchise and assume it's an action FPS not a thriller/horror and suddenly the game looks a hell of a lot better.The gameplay is fantastic with a nice variety of enemies and locations. The weapons have all the standard options (done well) and a couple of nice exotics. The 2 main characters play incredibly different and can give the solo campaign a totally different feel and then you've got the co-op campaign with all the complexities that can bring.I'm still♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥this isn't an excellent game like it should have been... but its still very good.

There's also coop and a few interesting multiplayer modes, but there is no alive community and you can't get into a match ""on the fly"". If you want multi, you'll need to grab a friend.

												The inaugural F.E.A.R was amazing. Blending FPS action with a hint of Japanese supernatural horror, which was a winner in my view. But can F.E.A.R 3 keep up with the hype? First of all, I never played F.E.A.R 2, but thanks to Google, I knew what happened as far as the plot is concerned. Gameplay wise, I would have to pass.I would just concentrate on the horror aspect of the game, since the gameplay mechanics is pretty much the same, with the ""bullet time"" system taking center stage. On a short note, the cover system can be a nuisance sometimes. Though, the ability to play as Fettel is a nice addition. I would also like to note that I've never played any of the multiplayer modes just yet, so I would have to pass.This third installment tried to live up the standards as set in the first game, well it tried(with emphasis). The signature Alma scares which was omnipresent in the first game isn't up on par here. The scares were freaky at best, with little fright value as compared to the first game. Remember the part where Alma was waiting at the top of the ladder? Yeah, nothing like that here. Although the sense of vulnerability is still present, much thanks to the survival horror themed inventory system. As for the enemies, well, they are fairly challenging, especially those high up in the ranks. Boss fights are straightforward, so nothing big about that. To sum it all up, F.E.A.R 3 doesn't live up much to its expectations. The relatively short campaign is a turn off. Couple that with a rather awkward ending. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who's never played any F.E.A.R title just yet. As for those who follow the franchise, well try to keep your expectations low.			"

												It's a decent shooter, but for me it really took the Fear out of F.E.A.R; fans of the series will surely be dissapointed in the lack of tension or atmosphere, and the story is far too shallow to warrant any investment. The gunplay is solid, but suffers from a lack of enemy type; there's only one supernatural enemy type, and the soldier classes are few and unoriginal. There are a few randomized jump scares that might get you here and there, but overall its not scary; it's built too much like a straight action game. The co-op is only as entertaining as the friend you're playing with, and it only serves to further detract from what little tension there was to begin with. As a huge fan of F.E.A.R. 1 and 2, I have to give this oe a thumbs down :(			"

												Do yourself a favor and don't pick up this game. ESPECIALLY if you're a fan of the first 2 games in the series.Disclaimer: I have not finished the game, despite trying repeatedly over the course of about a year. I just couldn't enjoy it.Pros:-Nice visuals, such as skin falling off enemies.-Solid shooting mechanics-Can get pretty spoopyCons:-Enemies, weapons, everything has been stripped from the previous games and replaced with very generic stuff.-Piggybacking on the above comment, the setting and pacing of the game do NOT fit in the franchise.-Terrible A.I. You'll run into two basic enemies, Armacham grunts who aren't a challenge even on the hardest difficulty, and what are essentially very poorly done zombies. Sometimes they have bombs strapped to their chests. The A.I do not react to gunfire or anything. You do fight these soldiers that are electrified? And they somehow shoot electricity and spawn more soldiers? I don't ♥♥♥♥ing know. The mechs are insanely easy to fight, just take cover and spam since they pretty much only use machine guns.-Regenerating health and endless amounts of ammo, effecting the pace of the game-Absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥tier story. Honestly feels like it was written by a child. Fettel and Pointman are a joke, you don't feel nearly as connected with either as you did with F.E.A.R 2's protagonist, or even Pointman himself in the first game.-Dead multiplayer-RPG elements CONSTANTLY popping up on your screen. 'LEVEL UP!' 'FASTER RELOAD!' 'DOUBLE XP!' 'FIND THE BODIES FOR MORE XP!'. It's absolutely ridiculous how intrusive it is.Overall it just feels like one of the most generic games I've ever played, and definitely one of the least fitting in its own franchise. It's a horrible disappointment. If you loved the first two games, just pretend this doesn't exist. It's what I'm desperately trying to do.Also, I know I constantly compare it to the other two games. If you haven't played the others, play them. If you want to play this on its own, buy it for less than 5 dollars, but don't buy it full price. It isn't fun, and it's definitely not worth putting on your backlog.			"

												This game is the best Co-Op horror with a storyline I ever played in my life. Thrilling and tons of fun when played with friends! The only bad side would be that it's a lot loss scary than the 2nd F.E.A.R.			"

												I really don't feel like going too much into it, but this game was a waste.This game is designed around co-op, but theres really no part I can recall that would have been better with it. And yes, this game is basically COD, like every other review says.Also the story absolutely tanks in this game. It's like they went with the most Hollywood story and ran with it.Left a very bad taste in my mouth.			"

												This game deviates from everything that made the original FEAR and it's expansions great. It includes regenerating health, cover system, extremely weak AI compared to the original, and I can't do my favorite thing anymore. That is kung foo replica soldiers to death. All of the fun has been stripped out to and replaced with call of duty elements in an effort to stay relevant, your melee attack is even a knife swing. But the FEAR series didnt need to buy into these tropes the gameplay in the first two was tense and had consequences. You were the ultimate bad♥♥♥♥♥but you had to think and use all the tools available to defeat the smart AI. Levels in the original have branching path ways and felt like real places with boosters to collect to make your health and reflexes better. Now we have a market point system that breaks the immersion of the game as an excuse to have customization. Varying enemy types had a heavier pressence in a battle, HEavy troopers would come through the wall while grunts out flank you. Now we have wave after wave of dumb always reacting the same soldiers. In every firefight i could run right up to the enemies with a shotgun and shoot them. It doesnt matter how much damage I take because I wont take enough to die and it regenerates anyway. Plus I have slo mo which is just a cop out in this game. Sometimes there are a few supernatural monsters thrown in, but it's all forced. I believe that during the production meetings they developed all of the shooter elements and while making the horror someone said, ""Just throw some scary crap in there. The game is called FEAR right?"". So sorry to say but FEAR 3 is lame, buy the original and its expansions Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, for shooters that actually feel good to play.			"

												Hours played - 5I'm somewhere near the end.So... in summary I'd have to say I'm disapointed.It's possible that Co-op was supposed to be a focus, and I didnt go into that.Somehow, I doubt that co-op would change my mind.The first fear was kind of frightening, had GREAT gunplay, and a mysterious story that you pieced together yourself.This one has decent gunplay.Yeah.I literally could not tune into the story. The story was so boring and irrelevant that my brain actually forced quit it's attempt to give a♥♥♥♥♥♥The atmosphere is usually pretty lame.

												F.E.A.R. 3 is supposedly the last in the series (although with the advent of F.E.A.R. Online, I'm not sure if the next one is fourth-coming... *yes lame pun intended*). I'm not quite sure where this one picks up from.. Closest guess is just after extraction point. Graphics have been improved again, and there is a new gameplay element that can be used depending on who you play as. The aim is better than the second, although their intelligence is nowhere near that of the original IMHO. the fear factor is also the least out of the entire series. However you will definitely have a challenging and worthwhile gameplay experience, although if you never played the previous titles, some of the storyline would be lost on you. It is definitely a good game whether you are a fan of the series or not.			"

It didn't surprise me that the game was even worse than the second one.At least now I can say I tried it.Buy the first F.E.A.R. with its expansions.

												Hmm. This game is interesting. Gameplay feels very much like a long hallway, a funnel; co-op playthrough is interesting as players get characters with distinct abilities that can either assist or harm the other player.As a paranormal horror based-game that it was supposed to be, I honestly wasn't impressed.  I'm not sure if this is because I didn't get into it because of the funneling technique, paranormal 'events' just don't translate well in video games. I just couldn't take it seriously. The plot was also exteremly hard to follow as there was no backfill for new players.Honestly, there's much better games out there, that have scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me when playing (i.e. Dead Space), that do a much better job of what was promised. I found myself joking and laughing at the comical and predictive nature of the game (e.g. -- oh wouldn't it be grand if X happened now? ...

												This one is kinda hard to rate as its both the worst and best of the FEAR games.The first two games suffered from bland locations, it was always boring allways and werehouses but this game has some quite intresting locations like a hardware store and south america style village.But with adding co op to the campain it loses all atmosphere, I know that I moaned about FEAR 2 losing alot of the scares from the first one but number 3 as pretty much no scarey bits at all (apart from one moment on a ladder)The score sytem braeks the immersion as well, but its around 6 to 7 hours long and it does have some replay value so its worth the money if you find it for cheap in a steam sale.

												Fear 3 is kinda like the orphaned abused brother to a successful family. It's filled with too much crap to really be anything, but generally gets through by giving people what they want, regardless of wether its actually beneficial to its own survival or not.Fear 3 is very try hardWith that out of the way, fear 3 is basically a mix of everything shooters have today, thrown into a goulash of ultra confusing and cluttered ""SHOOT EVERYTHINGHAKKG"" gameplay.Storyline? two guys hate eachother, one dies, the end. Then babies.How it feels? it's a console game through and through, playing it on a pc feels clunky and slow. ""BUT THE SLOW MO"" I hear you all crying out. Well it's here, they just ripped out everything good and hucked it at your face, and laughed. The slowmo drains much to fast, and mixed with clunky controls and last gen graphics, you'll be shooting at walls most of the time.But if you want a finale to a series, wether its crummy or not, here you go.

												There's not much I can add that other reviews don't already state. The gameplay seems more like C.o.D. than anything. The health kits are gone and replaced with a throbbing, veiny, red outline until you take cover and recuperate. The slow-mo kits are also missing and instead you search for radiating corpses and Alma dolls that increase your psychic ability.The storyline is lacking and transisition from mission to mission isn't as smooth as prior games due to the odd plot readers and post-mission point totals. I do not care how many points I earned in said mission. The game seems better geared towards co-op and maybe this was planned in anticipation of F.E.A.R. Online, which I've yet to play.There are two possible endings, depending on who you play as: Point Man or Fettel. Point Man's ending seems more fitting but still leaves you feeling lacking. Fettel's ending feels forced and doesn't really fit imo.On a positive note, the ragdoll effect is amusing. So is blowing off an enemy's limbs and half of their face with a shotgun. The mech missions are by far my favorite missions in this game and possessing a Spartan for a few seconds is slightly rewarding.Aside from the weird meth-zombies, (Halo) Spartan cross-overs, and shoddy Fettel gameplay, it's worth playing once if only to unravel the little bits of backstory fed to you over the course of the game and to conclude the♥♥♥♥♥♥of Becket in Project Origin.

												Despite all the hate coming from people, F3AR is enjoyable in its own right. Granted, gameplay was streamlined too much compared to the sequels that it feels too much like Cowadoodee (but not completely).For one, medkits are gone and regenerating health is the new heals BUT unlike COD, regenerating health can bite you in the♥♥♥♥♥also as enemies do like to punish you hard (as in if they're not understrength, they WILL push towards you while trying to regen health). So no medkit abuse to get out of a fight where you're guaranteed dead.Gunplay is a bit generic, but still enjoyable. You do have a destructible cover system that allows you to shoot from side to side, allowing for limited tactical gameplay. Its not original, but workable enough. The martial arts that the first game had and the second game downplayed, are now gone, however, which is a huge damn shame, because ♥♥♥♥ knives, I wanna punch and kick every person I can find like John Woo from hell.There's also a unique feature in F3AR in that you can play as the pointman's sociopathic brother: Paxton Fettel. On his own, he can only throw out telekinetic bolts and levitate thiungs and can't use guns. He can, however, posses certain enemy troops for a limited amount of time, allowing you to have your meat puppet wreak havoc on the enemy lines before doing it again. He can also make people's heads explode like in Scanners. If you can find a friend to play Co-Op with, the prospect is quite good.The atmosphere (after the first level) has to be one of the best features of the game. You do feel like in an apocalyptic wasteland after a psychic/nuclear disaster. It's not ""depressingly beautiful"" or ""adrenalin-pumping beautiful"" but just creepy. The more you progress, the more you see how horrifying Fairport has gone down under. People are crazy. Cannibalistic crazy. And the locations you venture through will reveal how high the level of crazy went into this place.As for difficulty, F3AR does have it. ATC Black Ops and the Replica troops are tough that they usually take a few hits to take down, have a kiiiinda decent set of tactics. Though, the AI does kinda shift from Competent to Call of Duty at times, but most of the time, they remain competent and will give you a run for your money. Cannibal AI is not that far from your everyday zombies from L4D and the likes, but they will try sneak attacks as much as possible.As for multiplayer. Its pretty much dead. Unless you have friends. Its dead.Overall, F3AR might be a bit shifty with its price of $10, but is a definite buy if its on sale. It'll give you some decent enjoyment for its price.			"

It has a 5 Star storyline, and if you like story lines, with action, horror, sorrow and multi-ending games, you should play the F.E.A.R. series. Trust me, it's worth it.Co-Op: The Co-OP is fantastic, I am missing the feature, to set wich character i want to play, in Co-Op mode, instead of the host only getting to pick.

												I will say this much about the game: It's  a really great shooter, but it's lacking the fear part. It's no longer scary, even though packed with action, it can be intense although not very challenging any more, it's enjoyable, gives you opportunity to take out frustration,  I also appreciate the co-op, but it no longer makes me afraid to advance, since there aren't really any supernatural fearsome enemies, even though maybe one gets somewhat close. I was delighted, but also somewhat disappointed when playing. The atmosphere does well to keep the immersion up, but you won't be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants and feeling vulnerable, rather the fact you're given so many options now will make you feel over-confident to a point where it supresses the fear part.

												This wasn't made by Monolith, instead being made by Day 1 Studios who worked on the console ports of the original FEAR titles. Outside the title, slow motion and returning characters from past games (You play as Point Man again) it's FEAR only in name. To begin with there's a two weapon limit, regenerating health, a focus on co-op and almost no horror. This makes it sound like it's a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥but I enjoyed it way more than the second and like it as much as the first FEAR since while it's not the same it has a better idea of what it wants to be than the second title which went for shooting and horror again but wasn't very good at either. It has the most varied and colorful locales in the series, some extremely statisfying combat, good co-op modes and the campaign itself is very good and made better if you play it with a friend. First player controls Point Man who can slow down time like he did in the first game, do fancy melee moves (slidekicking an enemy, entering slow motion and gibbing him with a shotgun blast rules), and ride mechs in certain areas. The second controls Fettel who can possess enemies such as soldiers (who control similar to Point Man but without the slow motion) and other more exotic ones who control differently, he can also just run around in ghost form killing enemies with some weird projectiles he shoots from his hands, or lift enemies into the air for Point Man to shoot if you want to share kills with your partner. Point Man can also do something similar by activating slow motion which will also give the ability to Fettel for as long as he keeps it active. Leaning is back in the form of a cover system that lets you peek around corners and shoot enemies. It works surprisingly well.Expect most of the game to revolve around the combat as there's very little downtime unlike past titles in the series.The co-op modes are the standard Horde mode where you barricade the area you start in similar to COD Zombies, ♥♥♥♥ing Run where you and 3 co-op partners must escape an approaching wall of death by running to the exit while killing enemies that try to slow you down, Soul King which is 4 players with Fettel's abilities trying to possess and kill as many AI enemies as they can, and finally Soul Survivor where one player must turn the rest of their team into monsters while they fend off enemy waves with the last surviving human player being given the option to escape.Like I mentioned above there isn't much horror in the game, there are some randomized scares in each playthrough of the campaign but almost every single one of them consists of things appearing when you open doors for a second then vanishing after the musical stinger plays. The final level is kind of ~~spooky~ the first time but that's about it.In the end it's not FEAR but it's still a pretty good game. I really enjoyed playing through the campaign both online and offline, playing the multiplayer modes and watching the surprisingly well done cutscenes that try to wrap up the mess of a storyline the series has.

												FEAR 3 (or ""F.3.A.R."" if you are so inclined) is an odd game. It's a horror FPS with a coop campaign, that grades you on play time and CoD style challenges. None of those things are exactly helpful when trying to establish a scary atmosphere. However, this doesn't stop the game from being an immensely fun shooter on it's own terms. All the important parts like weapon feel, movement, AI and enemy variety are solidly executed. If that would have been it, I would probably have played through the game in single player mode once and left it at that. The reason however for why I keep returning to this entry into the series and not the others, is the totally unique, totally awesome Paxton Fettel ghost mode. Using the (un)dead brother's ghost abilities feels just as satisfying as pulling of a really cool slow-motion moment, except with a much higher frequency. Possessing enemies across the map, shooting their squadmates and then bursting out of your unfortunate host practically never gets old. Why none of this gets unlocked for single player before beating the campaign once is beyond me.As much as FEAR 3 is the sequel, that nobody asked for, it's quite an underrated game. If you don't actually care about the story in FEAR and are looking for an, in many ways, unique shooter, I recommend it.			"

												This is not a bad game. As someone who doesn't really like First Person Shooters, or ever thought they would, I was entertained by this game for the most part. The cinematic mini-movies and cutscenes were very well done in terms of graphics and art and all that good stuff. Overall the soundtrack was good as well and really heightened the tension...well, where tension was SUPPOSED to be, I suppose.See I probably went ""Oh!"" in surprise/shock once in the entire game. Once. For a horror game that isn't a very good track record, yes? I feel that, compared to the other games in this series (of which I have seen people do walkthroughs of on YouTube) this one is the weakest in terms of scares and horrors. Of course, if you only played FEAR 3 and didn't play the other games, it wouldn't seem that scary because you haven't really dived into the universe that this story takes place in, with psychic soldiers and a handsome cannibal (cough) and a mute main lead that you control. And of course, Alma.Compared to the other installments this one also felt a little forced and the ending was anticlimactic. Despite dying quite a few times in the beginning and being stuck on where to go, this game went by fast. In terms of the story this series had to tell, this was the ""Falling Action --> Denouement"" portion of it, which we all know is the quickest-going part of any story, as that's what makes it entertaining, the speed and the tying of everything together.But since this was a separate game, separate from the events that occurred in FEAR and FEAR 2, it feels flat, much like you only read the last few chapters of a book instead of reading the whole thing. I know it's because I haven't played the games in order (ha..haha) but from the very first level there really isn't any...set-up as to why and where and who and how. You just have your mission, you do it, with Fettel snickering and most likely floating by your head with each event (Oh my God shut up I'm doing my damned job alright?!). It's not very strong on character development, at all. We know our players and we know what everyone is capable of so go go go go!! I will say that I very much enjoyed all of the weapons in the game and it made me feel good seeing the little pop-ups of achievements and points being made as I did certain things like killing this many dudes with an SMG or meleeing 30 dudes, etc. I did find the level design to be a little frustrating as well as my jumping abilities. Oh I can jump on THESE boxes but not THESE boxes? Getting stuck is also a small worry I have in the back of my head since sometimes the environment is climbable and other times it's all ""♥♥♥♥ your parkour, you ain't going ANYWHERE"".So I guess all-in-all this game was a little lackluster compared to the rest of the series which, while not having personally played it, know the capacity of horror and action possible; but if you like shoot-bangs and an awesome slo-mo ability as well as very well-done cutscenes I'd play this if I had nothing to do.

Possessing your enemies and using their own weapons against them was an excellent idea. It's more combat-oriented than the first game, probably as much so as the second, but still atmospheric and has its scary bits.			"

												Played FEAR 1 & 2? Nevermind this one is totally different, for one the pace of combat is so much faster. Thankfully the designers have put some thought into some eerie moments true to the original storyline. As for the storyline of this one, I suppose it fits in at a slightly skewed angle of sorts. Slight warning though, on my previous gfx card I experienced issues where the visual colours went haywire and they looked like your character was on a bad trip. Thankfully with my current card this doesn't seem to happen.All in all it plays well and I quite like it			"

												This game hasn't really improved upon F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin but is still a fun game to play. You basically play as Point Man, whom was the protagonist in the first F.E.A.R. game that was considered to be the best shooter of 2005. This game starts off by you being tortured in a jail cell by two gaurds and you have to escape to find Jin Sun Kwon. Here's where the plot problems come into play. The game doesn't tell you where or how you got to where you started, it just puts you there out of the blue, with no relation whatsoever to extraction point.The gameplay is like a basic first-person shooter with mechanics such as taking cover and jumping over obstacles. It's good but I hardly used it at all since how that controls is just hard to get used to. You also posses bullet time which allows you to slow down time and shoot at enemies much quicker and easier. This makes the game realitvly easy in the beginning but you will be greatful that you have it since the game gets realitvly hard and frustrating near the end.The major complaint I had with this game was that the game's difficulty is completly unfair when playing solo. Here's what I mean by that: When you have to fight the two commanders near the end of the second last level, you will die probably 10-20 times at least untill one of them gets hung up on the wall while you kill the other. Seriously if it wasn't for that I would be stuck here still trying to beat that part; it's just impossible.It's not a very good game but it's still a good game so I would still recommend you play this.

												I will say this much about the game: It's  a really great shooter, but it's lacking the fear part. It's no longer scary, even though packed with action, it can be intense although not very challenging any more, it's enjoyable, gives you opportunity to take out frustration,  I also appreciate the co-op, but it no longer makes me afraid to advance, since there aren't really any supernatural fearsome enemies, even though maybe one gets somewhat close. I was delighted, but also somewhat disappointed when playing. The atmosphere does well to keep the immersion up, but you won't be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants and feeling vulnerable, rather the fact you're given so many options now will make you feel over-confident to a point where it supresses the fear part. Still, it's a decent game, fun to play online, I recommend to play it.			"

												It's been 10 years since I played the first Fear game but I remember liking it. I only played a demo for the second one but it seemed cool too. This third game is something else. The story is just non interesting and at least half of the time I don't even really know what's going on. The gameplay is really just:Take coverPop up and fireTake cover so health can regeneratePop up and firerepeat until shooting gallery is emptyMove forwardRepeat shooting gallery processrepeat repeat repeat until level is overIt's a competent shooter, sure. I don't really know why it used the Fear name though. I guess if you like the Fear series and you wish it was actually Call of Duty then you'll dig it. It's OK but I wasn't really looking for Call of Feardy.I hear the multiplayer aspect is cool but I don't care about that stuff. I probably should have passed on this game but it's not completely horrible. It's just ""meh"" really. The FOV needs to be fixed right from the get go. It's pulled in way too tight. There's no option for it either . You will need to edit a config file. Also the graphics are muddy. There are no hi-res graphics to be found anywhere. This game really isn't that old. Sheesh. Typical console port.			"

												Oh my, I couldn't go far in this game.  I was a huge fan of F.E.A.R. and F.E.A.R. 2 - Those were very good games.  This 3rd installment seemed to lose track of what made the first two games enjoyable and unique, and reduce them to a strange extrapolation on the franchise.  To be honest, I didn't play the game long as the game's intrinsic departure from the overall feeling of the original two games was so dramatic that I couldn't get into it, and uninstalled it.If you really liked the first two games, I do not recommend this one.  If you haven't played the first two and love FPS games, perhaps get this when it's on sale.			"

												I bought this a while back on sale and quite enjoyed it, but ultimately I was left dissapointed by the length of the campaign.  F.E.A.R 1 still remains the best of the series (by quite a stretch) but I'd say this is an interesting diversion.The missions are replayable due to the score/challenge mechanics and the controls are fluid  Most of the campaign missions are enjoyable with very little downtime for exposition and cutscenes, meaning the pace remains fairly solid throughout.  Combat is fast paced, sometimes chaotic, but most of all fun with all the trade mark sillyness that comes from F.E.A.R's melee combat and wonky ragdoll physics.Both of the main characters have different play styles which does just enough to make each individual playthrough unique.  Although the linier paths through the missions are almost identical for each, they play very differently due to the mechanics.The multiplayer scene was dead before it even hit the ground.  The netcode is absolutely atrocious and even using direct P2P connections it would only connect on a handful of occasions.  It's a shame because the multiplayer had a chance to be genuinely enjoyable, with both co-operative and competative game modes.On the plus side you can still play these co-op missions solo via ""training"", but obviously it's not quite the same.The reason I'm reviewing this now is because I only recently came back to it and had an absolute blast playing through the campaign.  It's extremely silly, fast paced and mindless and if you can get it for under £5 I'd say it was money well spent.			"

												F.E.A.R.Worth playing at its time a lot of reused environments get old, but the gore and kill satisfaction is still one of the best to date which is sad for how old it is.F.E.A.R. Extraction PointSame old same old environments, guns, NPC, if You are a fan of Fear than its not all bad still fun combat.F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandateis a fun DLC and the funnest one, I thought beating extraction point was better than the main game sure its short around 4 hours and you can do everything and the bonus missions but there more in it than the F.E.A.R 1 there more weapons way more character models and change of environments most things all still stay grey but it feels better and a lot funner.Worth Playing for F.E.A.R Fans.F.E.A.R. 2: Rebornis a fun and big improvement on the genre with superb visuals and awesome events it is a sequel that does better than the original.Great GameI don't believe anyone plays this online couldn't find any servers as of 9/11/14F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin A glimpse at another perspective just seems cheap and made to grab a extra buck with nothing new.

												F.3.A.R. is a bad squeal to what F.E.A.R. 1 and 2 started. The combat is a big disappointment to the first two games. It feels more like Call of Duty then F.E.A.R. and the cover system does not work. Point Man got a personality and it sucks! The color red is too prominent. But Paxton's powers are cool. The game is poorly optimized thus runs poorly. Good luck getting a match in COOP. 5/10 would not play again. Edit: Also no Cheeto man :(			"

												F.3.A.R was a great game and I had lots of fun with it. The game is intense, SCARY AS HELL and fun. Although it can get a little repetetive and the sound/voice acting isn't anything special + the outdated graphics make this game: well less fun. The story was really interesting. Pointman and Fettel (brothers, sons of Alma) have to reach their mother and also erase their past. I played the game in Co-op with my friend and we had LOTS of fun with it. The game's scaryness adds to the fun.Gameplay: 8/10Graphics: 7/10Campaign: 9.3/10Scaryness: 9.5/10Overall: 85/100F.3.A.R is a really great horror game. Lots of fun to be had in Co-Op and the enjoyable story is fun to finish. I recommend it to everyone who likes horror games			"

												As someone who absolutely hated the original game, and thought the second had much to improve before it was a decent title, i am please to say F.E.A.R 3 is the best of the series. It's took three games to get here, but this feels like the perfect F.E.A.R title. It focuses more on fun co op gameplay and improves its mechanics rather than throwing in cheap scares. It's by no means perfect, compared to other games, as well as being extremely short at 4-5 hours, but it's one of the most enjoyable co op experiences i've had and is much better than it's predecessors.

												I am a huge fan of the FEAR game series and FEAR3 did not let me down. This game grows on me every time I play it. Fast action & smooth gameplay is one of the reasons I can't stop playing this game. Paxton Fettel takes a little getting used to. At the beginning, I was more comfortable playing as ""The Point man"", but now Fettel is my favourite character.I havn't tried Multiplayer but CO-OP sounds cool.  I prefer Singleplayer for games like this.You should also try the rest of the games in the FEAR series "

												Alright, let's get this out of the way: F.E.A.R 3 is NOT a bad game. It does what it does in a competent manner and there are some elements of it that are actually pretty good such as some of the art direction. But is it a great game? Not so much. While the core combat is decent, it is nowhere near the standard that F.E.A.R 1 introduced and F.E.A.R 2, to a extent, continued upholding. Guns no longer bite massive chunks off walls, particle effects are WAY downscaled and everything just feels a bit...off. But again, F.E.A.R 3 is not a bad game. If you want to see how the story ends or just want to play a decent FPS to tide you over until ""the next big thing"", then F.E.A.R 3 might just be worth picking up...during a sale.			"

												I must say first 1,5 hour was probably the worst FPS shooter experience ever.As I played this right after finishing 2nd F.E.A.R.The whole feeling is that it's just a console port to PC. Bad gameplay decisions, totally dumb AI and even not that impressive graphics with no scares just run and shoot.But after that 1,5 hour mark game introduces really interesting environments some good atmosphere moments. Also I think the ending that the best out of 3 franchise games. Not great, but better than previous games.If you are not familiar with previous games, skip and don’t waste your time. If you like previous F.E.A.R games and don’t have anything to play it might be worth a try. "

												I bought this a while back on sale and quite enjoyed it, but ultimately I was left dissapointed by the length of the campaign.  F.E.A.R 1 still remains the best of the series (by quite a stretch) but I'd say this is an interesting diversion.The missions are replayable due to the score/challenge mechanics and the controls are fluid  Most of the campaign missions are enjoyable with very little downtime for exposition and cutscenes, meaning the pace remains fairly solid throughout.  Combat is fast paced, sometimes chaotic, but most of all fun with all the trade mark sillyness that comes from F.E.A.R's melee combat and wonky ragdoll physics.Both of the main characters have different play styles which does just enough to make each individual playthrough unique.  Although the linier paths through the missions are almost identical for each, they play very differently due to the mechanics.The multiplayer scene was dead before it even hit the ground.  The netcode is absolutely atrocious and even using direct P2P connections it would only connect on a handful of occasions.  It's a shame because the multiplayer had a chance to be genuinely enjoyable, with both co-operative and competative game modes.On the plus side you can still play these co-op missions solo via ""training"", but obviously it's not quite the same.The reason I'm reviewing this now is because I only recently came back to it and had an absolute blast playing through the campaign.  It's extremely silly, fast paced and mindless and if you can get it for under £5 I'd say it was money well spent.			"

												A very good game if you were into F.E.A.R. What better way to end the series than being one of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sons of Alma herself, and causing carnage and death whereever you go!? I say nothing ladies and gentlemen, and it is very well shown the gifts passed down from mother to children. I have yet to play it on multiplayer but I am very anxious to try. Only cons about the game in general is like any other F.E.A.R. game, with the facts that they are all around to short and mission based...no free roam or true plot twists that will jump out at you unlike the many faces of Alma. Honestly, it is a game I would suggest if you are into a good first person shooter mixed with a few good jump scares and horror. 4 out of 5 stars.			"

												What can I say about Fear 3. I hope this is the end of the series. I really enjoyed FEAR and ever since it has been going down hill for me. Each subsequent release gets shorter and less scary. It is ripe with sequelitis. The story adds an interesting dynamic to the FEAR universe that leaves as many questions as answers. I played this through twice both in coop and we were able to see both endings, that is to say I won both times. the coop isnt that much co-operative but more competitive. you have the same goal in the story but the last scene Entirely depends on who got the most points and combos. The level design seemed to be wasted at times as many of the interval transitions were random and felt like half the game was Cut. a few levels were just there, nothing happened at all in them, again a waste. the graphics are astounding but why wouldnt you expect them to be. If you liked Fear 2 then this is right up your alley, but its lost what FEAR was. 6.5/10			"

												I played this game because I was in the mood for some scares, but ended up with a bunch of feels that I didn't know what to do with.Honestly, I see a lot of people poo-pooing this game for having a bad plot, messing up the series, blah dee blah...But I absolutely loved it.The strange love/hate relationship between the two brothers is something I found to be very tragic and engaging. Unlike the past two games, this one humanized Alma and Paxton to the point where I actually sympathized with them, and the final scenes (both ""good"" and ""bad"") left me torn. Both brothers have been deeply wronged, and it was fascinating how each one dealt with their past... With Paxton choosing vengeance no matter the cost, and Point Man choosing to not give up on mankind, which in turn gave way to mercy.Maybe I'm just a sap, but this game is going to stick with me for a long time.

												F.E.A.R. 3....... this is a love it or hate it type of game. It is completely different from the previous games. It doesn't play like a FEAR game, it plays like ""just another FPS game"". The suspense and scare moments aren't here at all. The story is terrible, filled with plot holes. No character development or proper believable narration to speak of. There are a total of only TWO NPC you will have a conversation with in the whole game. It feels like I'm in a game killing hundreds of faceless and nameless enemies for no reason. There is no story immersion.There is no more health&armor points either. The game is so consolified it dilluted the F.E.A.R. experience. Just hide and wait for the redness to disappear from your screen. This type of health works with some games but it shouldn't have been used on a F.E.A.R. game. As an FPS game, it's fine. Especially if you haven't played the previous games. But if you did play them, you will feel like you're playing a very watered down sequel that doesn't take the last games seriously.I did not play the co-op mode but they say that is quite enjoyable.

												Sorry F.E.A.R. fans, and sorry for myself :(Remembering FEAR 2 goes back in time, FEAR 3 episode goes Forward in the story again.Acording to the story events: FEAR 2 > FEAR (and expansions) > FEAR 3Just like any blockbuster, this game lives out of the previous successes. I have seen many bad reviews, unfortunatly they were all well fundamented. The story goes around the ""Weird Family"", just like any cheap TV show, now formed by: Alma the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off dead Mum, her violent sons (we can play both), her new GI-Joe-boyfriend, and her new baby (Good Job Mr. GI Joe!!)Ok.. lets skip for goodies and badies..[Goodies]- Being able to replay the game with both brothers and use tactics according to their skills- Some visual improvement over FEAR 2 (but not much)- Some interesting ""bosses"" and get to drive a mech again =)[So so]AI: The AI looks ok, sometimes they move and change hideouts. I think FEAR 1 and 2 had a lot more fun AI. This ones just hide too much. They are predictable and we can be confident nothing fancy will happen. They do behave more realistic because I also wouldnt go out of the hideout if I was watching all my friends die =)[Badies]Where am I supposed to get chills and jump from my chair? It DID happenen in the other episodes. This game moves out of the thing that made it so interesting. Creepy stuff that wouldn't stop surprising me ( aka ""gotta-change-pants-again factor"")Sound: You dont know how I missed the comments from the enemies, full of courage or.. desperating in fear. In FEAR 3 they just say the same GI-Joe stuff through the whole game without any emotion.[Horrible!]Last the not least, the main reason for the score..I expected to play an FPS-creppy game and I was presented with a HUD full of fancy cheerful RPG stuff.Please keep the ""Mission Score"", ""Found Items"", ""Play Style scores"", ""Achievements for shooting"", ""Achievements for camping"".. bla bla bla FOR YOURSELF! Just give me a damn creepy game.Believe me, its hard to jump out of my chair at the same time a pop-up saying something like ""CONGRATS! YOU'RE RANK IS NOW PIKACHU 7"" comes on the screen. But despite falling behind in the FEAR series, its still a nice shooter.PlayTime: 13 hours (As pointman) + 1 hour (a few speedy levels with Fettel)Score: 6 / 10			"

												FEAR and it's sequel were really good games, both managed to be scary in their own way and have some really fun shooting in it. Heck, FEAR 1 has some still impressive AI behind it. FEAR 3 is a dumbed down shooter, player 2 gets some different mechanics if you're playing co-op but honestly the game is weak all the way to the lame last boss. I'm not being overly harsh either, I've played some dumb shooters and enjoyed them but FEAR had some bite to the combat, this game frankly doesn't. You have regenerating health...and a cover system, seriously that's how far they've dragged this game down. Deadspace 3 was pretty butchered, it was at least a fun co-op experience this game got pretty dull, the good news you won't be bored long, it's less than 5 hours on hard mode. The game has some neat visuals but that's about all it's got going for it. They just straight up seemed to forget to add any actual horror in it. It has none of the jumpscares of the previous ones, the tense atmosphere. The final boss was as generic as you can get, without spoiling it? Big slow monster beyond a 'fence' that you shoot at chipping away parts of it till you win. I don't know what they're bragging about on the steam page, they didn't bring any of the hallmarks that deliver anything from previous FEAR games. If you're a fan of the FEAR series? Don't bother, this could have been a totally different game they renamed to FEAR and I'd believe it.  If you're just a fan of a good shoot-y game? STILL don't bother, there's better games for cheaper. If you got this in a bundle? Gift it to someone.			"

												F3AR attempts to tie up loose ends and combine the various story arcs of FEAR1 and FEAR2 into a cohesive narrative.The gameplay is heavily consolized, even when compared to FEAR2, and destruction  & environmental interaction have suffered as well. Gone are the brilliant dynamic lights and particles of FEAR1. However, the lighting and art direction are very well done.Creepy? Not at all. Fun? Pretty fun, yeah. Worthwhile if only to close off the story from the first two.			"

												By now, no one should expect new iterations of F.E.A.R. to be scary. While the first installment was the spawn of pure horror, Project Origin slowly deviated from the intense and moody atmosphere carefully crafted before. F.E.A.R. 3 returns to complete this leap, surprisingly finding itself on solid grounds.First and foremost, F.E.A.R. 3 is not a single player game. The campaign was designed for cooperative play. Expect some levels to be near impossible to beat unless played on a lower, and consequently less exciting, difficulty.As a mainly cooperative game, F.E.A.R. 3 is a shining example of how games don't need a competitive edge for replayability. Playing through the campaign with a buddy is a good experience, but it's in the various other game modes that this purchase becomes worthwhile.If you're looking for a horror game, you'll want to skip this. But, if you're looking for a thrilling experience to share with a friend, this instantly becomes a must-buy.Grade: B			"

												F.E.A.R. 3Story 3/5  nothing really interesting that makes you want to immerse into these section of the game.The story is good enough to keep anyone playing and  not to annoy yourself in the gaming experience.Gameplay; Shooter Mechanics 4.3/5  the gameplay is fun with healthy amount variety of guns, the maneuverability feels smooth and meleeing enemies is more encouraged in this game and the game itself is  challenging enough. Innovation 3.9/5  you can pilot a mech....you should  like that.Overall:  7/10 I stating this review without comparing this  game to its predecessors because i never played them so i dont know any sorts of improvement in the series.

												FEAR 3 is similar to FEAR 2 on first glance however the key feature to this game which I think makes it the most interesting before even getting started on the plot is the new 'coop' gameplay.In this game you can play as the 'pointman' as in the first FEAR or as player 2 play as 'Paxton Fetel' who has the ability to possess enemies and take control of them from a first person perspective while being able to use everything the enemy has on them.This game has a points system even in single player and although its meant to be horror the elements of competitive gameplay features have emerged.

												Whilst I don't recommend this game what I'm not saying is that F.E.A.R. 3 is a bad game or something you shouldn't spend your money on, but rather that you shouldn't expect to be blown away by what you find here. Picked this game up for the 2 player campaign co-op which I played through over 2-3 sittings (approx 6.5hrs) - during which I found the game to be a hum-drum shooter with uninspired opponents and a story which made zero sense to me. I couldn't follow it. Some co-op mechanics are present but ultimately these are unnecessary and lack the polished execution of say, Left 4 Dead 1/2. Perhaps the biggest let down here is the horror (supposedly this is meant to be a scary game) which is lackluster throughout. The closest thing I can approximate this title to is a Call-of-Duty esque linear shooter without the production value. All this said, it wasn't so terrible we stopped playing - and there is a co-op scene with mechs which is a highlight. Give this one a whirl with a friend to pass some hours - but don't part with too much cash or you will be disappointed.			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 makes me fear one thing and one thing only: having to play it any more.This game manages to make a generic shooter that is so generic I feel like I'm experiencing perpetual deja vu.Playing the campaign with a friend is, to some degree, fun. I use that term loosely.The idea is simple: here are some guns. There are some soldiers. Every once in a while, you'll see a monster. Shoot them with the guns.I will concede that some people can be scared by FEAR 3, but only those who are scared by jack-in-the-boxes.In co-op, the second player can take over the bodies of enemy soldiers and use various psychic powers, but that basically just means that they spend 5 seconds looking for a body and then return to the generic shooter playstyle.There are very, very few weapons- a rifle, a sniper-rifle, a shotgun, an smg, a pistol, and dual smgs (as far as I can tell. There might have been others, but they all really handle the same.)Enemies are unvaried: There is normal soldier, heavy soldier, sniper soldier, normal monster, knife monster, and exploding monster. Though there are six, you only fight three in most levels.All in all, F.E.A.R. 3 isn't awful, but it's definitely not good.Average Playtime: 5 hours.Price: $20.00$/hour: $4.00/hour.Final Score: 5.0/10Letter Grade: FVerdict: ""Worse than mayonnaise.""

												While not all that scary, FEAR 3 makes a decent FPS. The gunplay is well done; guns sound heavy and powerful. The pistol alone has a great feel that will make you want to use it over more powerful weapons. The enemy AI is particularly good; soldiers will dive for cover and aggressively flank you, forcing you to change up your tactics instead of camping behind cover and taking potshots. The game isn't all action however, and there are some atmospheric moments in the game that horror fans will appreciate. Once the main campaign is complete, the second character is unlocked, and the game can be played again with him. This actually gives a different gameplay experience because the second character focuses more on psychic abilities as opposed to brute force. The game can also be played through in co-op with a friend, using both characters at the same time. There are also some unique multiplayer modes, but unfortunately seems to be devoid of players.			"

												This game was a major disapointment, but lets start with the positives. Its multiplayer and player two will have a very unique experience as a ghosty goo that can do all manor of neat tricks other then player 1 who can shoot and slow time. The shooting mechanics is decent, the graphics are decent, the gun selection and balance is... ok.Now for the cons. WEAK WEAK WEAK story telling. First 20 minutes you dont really know whats going on, you rarely know why your doing the things your doing, Fetten the ghost is the only person who talks which doesnt work if your goint to put him and Point Man in a dozen or so cutscenes together, while Point Man stares and grimaces at Fetten and well EVERYTHING else... also Pointman looks like a caveman from a car insurance comercial, you wont care a bit if either of these main characters live or die because they are both uninteresting or in Fettens case ANNOYING. He tries soooo hard to be creepy and scary, most of the dialogue in the game is him... being creepy and trying to be scary. There is nothing scary about the game minus two or three jump scares with an enemy never fully explained and it has an ending that is SURE to leave you eye rolling and disapointed... or if Fetten scores a higher ranking in multiplayer disgusted and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at the writers. Level design is terrible, me and my friend got lost often. There's no creepy, scary vibe. It just feels like your playing CoD and your charging through Silent Hill with little regard, stomping over any sloppy attempts to scare or unnerve you, the amature designers tried to catch you with. Alma... she isnt really in the game much. She plays a ""pivotal"" role in the story... but in the background, off in the details somewhere and it felt like they replaced her with Fetten... the player 2 or dialogue spewing NPC helper to be your creepy scare factor. As I stated how effective that is, it was down right insulting to the original FEAR to see her utilized so♥♥♥♥♥♥poorly. She will sometimes appear to stare at you... and thats it. She doesnt do anything else and its just NOT FEAR.So... if its on sale for 3-5 dollars pick up this game and play with a friend. If its on sale for 6-10 dollars, pass... pass pass pass.			"

It has some features that give it an amazing replay value as well. It's a little too dark for me to play twice, though.			"

Interestingly enough, I think that if you play more the other brother and not Point Man during the game, the ending will be different.There is still a little something that is missing to make of F.E.A.R. 3 a good game.

												Terrible gameplay. FEAR 2 was a pretty amazing game but it looks like the gameplay just took a nosedive for FEAR 3. Shooting is not fun, the shotgun just doesn't work the same, the enemies are annoying as they shoot blindly from behind cover so all you basically have to do is run up and melee them. One of the worst things is that they took away the health bar and armor so that its basically call of duty style where you take damage, hide in cover for the appropriate amount of time and magically you're fully healed. All parts of the gameplay are just massive downgrades from its predecessor, even the bullet time just doesn't feel right. I wanted to enjoy the game because I loved FEAR 2 and the storyline was pretty gripping but there's just no way I can deal with playing through this entire game. Enjoy the previous games and just save yourself the trouble and skip this one.			"

												If not for the FEAR name, would be a great game. Good graphs gameplay and a fun gameplay, taking the AI ​​(which in previous fear were better). The huge problem is the lack of the great personality of fear within the game, you did not take no fright, or will or even monstrous scary moments. The plot is pretty weak and super predictable ending. Even if the difficulty of fever and was set aside. If you're a fan of the series worth playing, but not create any expectations.Se não fosse o nome FEAR, seria um grande jogo. Bom graficos jogabilidade e um gameplay divertido, tirando a IA (que nos fear anteriores eram melhores).O enorme problema é a falta da grande personalidade de fear dentro do jogo, vc não tomara nenhum susto, ou terá momentos assustadores ou mesmo monstruosos.

												Maybe I have played the Fear series a bit too much but so far this section of the (what I consider) beautifly written Fear series has yet to make me jump up and have a ""WTF"" moment.  With that said however, I still would recommend this game.  The movement of your characters feels a bit off, but the weapons, the graphics are amazing. I do not care for how linear the game feels though.  I understand most FPS games are linear but I did not feel that in the first 2 fear games.  I give the game a solid 6/10.  It keeps me coming back and playing, but It just does not have the same feel to the story like the first one did.  Moments in the first game left me scared and shocked and left with an adreniline rush, I felt fear for my avatar as I was running around wtih him in part one, Fear 3 however, I could really care less if my character dies (which I think is a casuality of having a game that automatically saves at check points vs requiring you to choose when to save). 6/10			"

I dont agree with a gaming model where you force replayability just to get a perfect score. i guess half the fun is to play it in CoOp, but i dont think i have anyone id like to play this game with. it just dosent enforce the same type of wth-was-that-feeling that ive seen Dead Space 3 create or that you get in Fear 1 or 2. Basicly,  youre not scared. kinda like replaying Doom3 for the forth time, you know where all the monsters are going to pop up, so its more a shooting gallery then a fright-game.the meccha-parts were cool tho. idk, make a new game centerd about that ?

												I don't think any of the reviewers gave this game a fair chance. There's an amazing shooter here, obscured by cheap horror tricks that failed to scare me 2 games ago and the predictable story. Day 1 Studio's take on F.E.A.R. is simply an ultra-gory action romp, and should be taken as such. When that's out of the way, the game's centrepiece comes into focus: the shooting. This is maybe one of the only games that gets the modern shooting model right. The cover system here never feels cheap or clumsy and never becomes a bore because the AI soldiers work in perfect synergy with one another to flank, frag and shoot down any cover you're trying to exploit. The shooting is tight and satisfying and kept at a fast pace because of the regenerating health. In Co-op, this game is just amazing. Pointman's slow motion allows him to take out whole swaths of enemies in between taking cover and perferming satisfying headshots while slowing time, while Fettel is a bad♥♥♥♥♥with the way he jumps into the fray by possessing people and murdering them close-up. There is a pretty deep achievement system here meant to have the two players compete and a levelling system that I've maxed out at level 21. The 4 multiplayer modes are really strong and not what you find in other shooters. In fact, the contractions (horde) mode is actually pretty intense, complete with randomnly generated Alma. A pity they are all dead right now. I've played through the campaign 4 times on increasing difficulties and somehow...the shooting keeps bringing me back.			"

												a good FPS while the SP isnt anything to brag about playing solo but playing it with a friend is quite fun cause fettle has some Unique powers to support the point man and point man can slow down time so the both of you can pick off your enemies with ease so the game encourages teamwork and now off to the multi-player this is where FEAR3 stands out theres 4 modes one is where the squad has to run away from a wall that will kill anyone who gose near it and  while your running away from the wall you have to fight off enemies and the 2nd mode witch is much like the zombies mode from cod but in the FEAR world and the 3rd mode is where a member of the squad is corrupt by alma then they will have to try to bring down his former squad and corrupt them and theres the 4th mode is where all the players start off as a ghost where they kill as many A.I. humans as possible and if they dies they will lose half of there points so to sum this up this is a good game if you have someone to play with  "

												This is not a bad game. As someone who doesn't really like First Person Shooters, or ever thought they would, I was entertained by this game for the most part. The cinematic mini-movies and cutscenes were very well done in terms of graphics and art and all that good stuff. Overall the soundtrack was good as well and really heightened the tension...well, where tension was SUPPOSED to be, I suppose.See I probably went ""Oh!"" in surprise/shock once in the entire game. Once. For a horror game that isn't a very good track record, yes? I feel that, compared to the other games in this series (of which I have seen people do walkthroughs of on YouTube) this one is the weakest in terms of scares and horrors. Of course, if you only played FEAR 3 and didn't play the other games, it wouldn't seem that scary because you haven't really dived into the universe that this story takes place in, with psychic soldiers and a handsome cannibal (cough) and a mute main lead that you control. And of course, Alma.Compared to the other installments this one also felt a little forced and the ending was anticlimactic. Despite dying quite a few times in the beginning and being stuck on where to go, this game went by fast. In terms of the story this series had to tell, this was the ""Falling Action --> Denouement"" portion of it, which we all know is the quickest-going part of any story, as that's what makes it entertaining, the speed and the tying of everything together.But since this was a separate game, separate from the events that occurred in FEAR and FEAR 2, it feels flat, much like you only read the last few chapters of a book instead of reading the whole thing. I know it's because I haven't played the games in order (ha..haha) but from the very first level there really isn't any...set-up as to why and where and who and how. You just have your mission, you do it, with Fettel snickering and most likely floating by your head with each event (Oh my God shut up I'm doing my damned job alright?!). It's not very strong on character development, at all. We know our players and we know what everyone is capable of so go go go go!! I will say that I very much enjoyed all of the weapons in the game and it made me feel good seeing the little pop-ups of achievements and points being made as I did certain things like killing this many dudes with an SMG or meleeing 30 dudes, etc. I did find the level design to be a little frustrating as well as my jumping abilities. Oh I can jump on THESE boxes but not THESE boxes? Getting stuck is also a small worry I have in the back of my head since sometimes the environment is climbable and other times it's all ""♥♥♥♥ your parkour, you ain't going ANYWHERE"".So I guess all-in-all this game was a little lackluster compared to the rest of the series which, while not having personally played it, know the capacity of horror and action possible; but if you like shoot-bangs and an awesome slo-mo ability as well as very well-done cutscenes I'd play this if I had nothing to do.

If you've played the earlier games you should pick this one up and see the story through since it is not likely there will be more games in the future.""Day 1 Studios"" took over the helm from ""Monolith"" and ""Time Gate Studios"" and did an excellent job. The graphics are pretty nice and the controls are more responsive than ever before in any ""F.E.A.R.""-game. The level design was also better than previous games with more varied maps.+ Nice ending to a good FPS-series.+ Fun gameplay.+ Slow-Mo (need I say more).+ The pointsystem.- Some of the cutscenes are a bit lenghty.- Some enemies have bad Ai.- From what I could see, you can not play as Fettel in SP-mode.

Unfortunetly this is basicly a single player game now adays and you'll need to find friends to play with, the online is dead. The game does have alot of replayability to it tho. Do to achievements and a fun scoring system for the campaign and fun solo challenges.Still completely worth the ride if you ask me.			"

There literally is no sense of fear that was heavily present in the first 2 games. Usually if a game is CoD'ish I can back it up with the story, however this game's story was half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's as though they couldn't decide on what to do so they took from 2 and expanded it. Should of just called this game F.E.A.R 2.5.The A.I. seems to have actually downgraded from the original games, guess that's expected when a game has to dumb down for console style gameplay. I would pass on this one unless you see it under $3 and really want to play it.			"

												where to begin... well i personally liked the other 2 games better.  it wasn't scary and it was heavly focused on action.  the gun play in it is ok enough but not alot of scares.    the story didnt really make sense and it didnt follow the other 2 fears. often times i had to go to a wiki to understand what was going on becasue what happens in fear 3 makes no sense with the other 2 games.  another big letdown was fettle.  you have the option of playing this psychic ""badass"" but only after you complete the level as ""point man"" which was dumb because some of the levels were snore fests and i didnt even care enough to run it again as fettle.  speaking of fettle he is a let down in this game compared to fear 1. When you do play him he has a weak  psychic attack ability that loses its appeal in the first few battles. He also has this ability to ""posses"" enemys then use them to kill off opponents. i hate this ability because then you pretty much are point man again. the only ability i did enjoy was the psychic hold ability where you can suspend people in mid air. another beef i had is this game is ultra short. i ran through this game in roughly 4 hours. that wouldnt be all that bad if there was a community to play online with but there isn't  the only real fun i can see with this game is running it in co-op but again internet supoort is pretty much void.in summery. the game is not all that scary, has a strange plot that to me didnt make abit of sense. the option of playing fettle only to prolong the games life but in the end its not worth it, and the game overall is very short. if you have played the other fear games i suggest playing this just to finish the series. but as a stand alone title its worth skipping.i rate this game a 1.5 out of 5 stars			"

												Ok, this one is a little bit tricky since i did not play this game to the ende. You could say i barely started and played it.Let's see.... if you've played F.E.A.R you know it's a horror shooter. A shooter that keeps you binded in front of the screen even though you really think it's creepy and fear is crawling up your neck. That's the feeling i so hoped for. But not in this game.I stopped when i was in a battle where infinite enemies came (i hadn't reached the checkpoint where it would end at that time), hasted around a corner and ...... saw a little ""Alma Puppet"" floating in the air and spinning around.I was like ""What the ♥♥♥♥?"" and stunned. First i didn't realized it was only a ""puppet"" and thought ""♥♥♥♥♥♥ now it get's creepy ...""And it got creepy. Nothing happened. So i walked into this ""floating, spinning Alma-Puppet-Thingy"" that was there and got ... 1000 Points!1000 Points for what?What is this♥♥♥♥♥♥doing in a horror game?That was the moment i closed the game, deleted it from my harddisk and it should never NEVER be played again.

And if you can get some friends together, the multiplayer would be pretty cool.

It has a 5 Star storyline, and if you like story lines, with action, horror, sorrow and multi-ending games, you should play the F.E.A.R. series. Trust me, it's worth it.Co-Op: The Co-OP is fantastic, I am missing the feature, to set wich character i want to play, in Co-Op mode, instead of the host only getting to pick.

												This wasn't made by Monolith, instead being made by Day 1 Studios who worked on the console ports of the original FEAR titles. Outside the title, slow motion and returning characters from past games (You play as Point Man again) it's FEAR only in name. To begin with there's a two weapon limit, regenerating health, a focus on co-op and almost no horror. This makes it sound like it's a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥but I enjoyed it way more than the second and like it as much as the first FEAR since while it's not the same it has a better idea of what it wants to be than the second title which went for shooting and horror again but wasn't very good at either. It has the most varied and colorful locales in the series, some extremely statisfying combat, good co-op modes and the campaign itself is very good and made better if you play it with a friend. First player controls Point Man who can slow down time like he did in the first game, do fancy melee moves (slidekicking an enemy, entering slow motion and gibbing him with a shotgun blast rules), and ride mechs in certain areas. The second controls Fettel who can possess enemies such as soldiers (who control similar to Point Man but without the slow motion) and other more exotic ones who control differently, he can also just run around in ghost form killing enemies with some weird projectiles he shoots from his hands, or lift enemies into the air for Point Man to shoot if you want to share kills with your partner. Point Man can also do something similar by activating slow motion which will also give the ability to Fettel for as long as he keeps it active. Leaning is back in the form of a cover system that lets you peek around corners and shoot enemies. It works surprisingly well.Expect most of the game to revolve around the combat as there's very little downtime unlike past titles in the series.The co-op modes are the standard Horde mode where you barricade the area you start in similar to COD Zombies, ♥♥♥♥ing Run where you and 3 co-op partners must escape an approaching wall of death by running to the exit while killing enemies that try to slow you down, Soul King which is 4 players with Fettel's abilities trying to possess and kill as many AI enemies as they can, and finally Soul Survivor where one player must turn the rest of their team into monsters while they fend off enemy waves with the last surviving human player being given the option to escape.Like I mentioned above there isn't much horror in the game, there are some randomized scares in each playthrough of the campaign but almost every single one of them consists of things appearing when you open doors for a second then vanishing after the musical stinger plays. The final level is kind of ~~spooky~ the first time but that's about it.In the end it's not FEAR but it's still a pretty good game. I really enjoyed playing through the campaign both online and offline, playing the multiplayer modes and watching the surprisingly well done cutscenes that try to wrap up the mess of a storyline the series has.

												It's a decent shooter, but for me it really took the Fear out of F.E.A.R; fans of the series will surely be dissapointed in the lack of tension or atmosphere, and the story is far too shallow to warrant any investment. The gunplay is solid, but suffers from a lack of enemy type; there's only one supernatural enemy type, and the soldier classes are few and unoriginal. There are a few randomized jump scares that might get you here and there, but overall its not scary; it's built too much like a straight action game. The co-op is only as entertaining as the friend you're playing with, and it only serves to further detract from what little tension there was to begin with. As a huge fan of F.E.A.R. 1 and 2, I have to give this oe a thumbs down :(			"

												What I liked:-the return of point man-different enemies-easier to kill enemies in gory ways-great level designWhat I disliked:-Alma isn't seen as much as the last two games-Weird controls-WAY more challenging since all the enemies can kill you in a mere 4 seconds from full health.Conclusion:F.3.A.R. is disappointing, even though I think the series didn't need a third installment.  I do recommended it, especially if you have played the first two games, but considering what this could have been, you may be disappointed.  I would like to see some sort of continuation, though, to figure out what happens to the baby, Point Man, Fettel, and Alma.			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 is an unusual yet fun installment of the F.E.A.R. series. It is focused on the online aspect so the story of the game is told in a very fragmented and overall poor way, however this doesn't stop the levels from being fun. It reminds me of Modern Warfare 2 more than it does of the previous F.E.A.R. games. Thus, if you hate Modern Warfare you may want to wait until the game is cheaper.F.E.A.R. 3 is longer than other First Person Shooters of this generation. The game has eight levels with four modes of difficulty, with two characters to select from and a scoring system similar to Call of Duty's multiplayer challenges. All of this means that there is a lot of replay value to be had from this game. "

												A great game on its own merits.  None of the FEAR sequels will ever live up to the original game's awsome atmosphere and intense multiplayer action.  FEAR 3 is the conclusion to the FEAR trilogy and while the FPS action is great, the single player story is boring and tacked on.  The events from FEAR 2 are just thrown aside and the protagonist from that game is as throw away as the plot for this game was.  I still recommend the game for the FPS action but dont go in for the story.			"

												This game was a major disapointment, but lets start with the positives. Its multiplayer and player two will have a very unique experience as a ghosty goo that can do all manor of neat tricks other then player 1 who can shoot and slow time. The shooting mechanics is decent, the graphics are decent, the gun selection and balance is... ok.Now for the cons. WEAK WEAK WEAK story telling. First 20 minutes you dont really know whats going on, you rarely know why your doing the things your doing, Fetten the ghost is the only person who talks which doesnt work if your goint to put him and Point Man in a dozen or so cutscenes together, while Point Man stares and grimaces at Fetten and well EVERYTHING else... also Pointman looks like a caveman from a car insurance comercial, you wont care a bit if either of these main characters live or die because they are both uninteresting or in Fettens case ANNOYING. He tries soooo hard to be creepy and scary, most of the dialogue in the game is him... being creepy and trying to be scary. There is nothing scary about the game minus two or three jump scares with an enemy never fully explained and it has an ending that is SURE to leave you eye rolling and disapointed... or if Fetten scores a higher ranking in multiplayer disgusted and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at the writers. Level design is terrible, me and my friend got lost often. There's no creepy, scary vibe. It just feels like your playing CoD and your charging through Silent Hill with little regard, stomping over any sloppy attempts to scare or unnerve you, the amature designers tried to catch you with. Alma... she isnt really in the game much. She plays a ""pivotal"" role in the story... but in the background, off in the details somewhere and it felt like they replaced her with Fetten... the player 2 or dialogue spewing NPC helper to be your creepy scare factor. As I stated how effective that is, it was down right insulting to the original FEAR to see her utilized so♥♥♥♥♥♥poorly. She will sometimes appear to stare at you... and thats it. She doesnt do anything else and its just NOT FEAR.So... if its on sale for 3-5 dollars pick up this game and play with a friend. If its on sale for 6-10 dollars, pass... pass pass pass.			"

												Maybe I have played the Fear series a bit too much but so far this section of the (what I consider) beautifly written Fear series has yet to make me jump up and have a ""WTF"" moment.  With that said however, I still would recommend this game.  The movement of your characters feels a bit off, but the weapons, the graphics are amazing. I do not care for how linear the game feels though.  I understand most FPS games are linear but I did not feel that in the first 2 fear games.  I give the game a solid 6/10.  It keeps me coming back and playing, but It just does not have the same feel to the story like the first one did.  Moments in the first game left me scared and shocked and left with an adreniline rush, I felt fear for my avatar as I was running around wtih him in part one, Fear 3 however, I could really care less if my character dies (which I think is a casuality of having a game that automatically saves at check points vs requiring you to choose when to save). 6/10			"

												Game is fun especially with the addition of coop to the F.E.A.R. series, however it is a VERY short game that could be beaten in a single setting assuming you have 3 or 4 hours of free time.  The ending which is determined by who has more points at the end of the game whether you played as Point Man or Fettel  (assuming you aren't playing single player) is another nice addition turning the friendly coop into a competition.  The game dives back into the origin of Alma's two sons and explains what they went through while growing up in a ward and how their abilities were acquired.  The multiplayer aspect is subpar but really where this game shines is with the coop.  I bought it on sale for $8 and honestly I wouldn't pay more than that for this game.  Not saying the game is bad, just saying that for $20, there are better choices to spend your money on.			"

												This game is pretty much an old-school shooter. Very linear, unfortunatly the plot doesn't even make up for that. The style overall seems fine, but the graphic isn't the best coupling for F3AR, ironically Fear 2 looks even better for many reasons (a more polished and balanced graphics, a better plot, etc).If you came from Fear 1&2, you might be kinda disappointed playing a game that has quite a bit of Call-of-Dutyness to it, without even feeling nearly as much as fun to play. There isn't really a variety of weapons, and you can carry only a few (3 if i recall correctly).In the end, i'd rate this game at 7/10. It might deserves a wee bit more, but surely not with the name it carries. Bottom line: it's short. It's fast. Meh. You can find better bang for your buck.			"

												As someone who absolutely hated the original game, and thought the second had much to improve before it was a decent title, i am please to say F.E.A.R 3 is the best of the series. It's took three games to get here, but this feels like the perfect F.E.A.R title. It focuses more on fun co op gameplay and improves its mechanics rather than throwing in cheap scares. It's by no means perfect, compared to other games, as well as being extremely short at 4-5 hours, but it's one of the most enjoyable co op experiences i've had and is much better than it's predecessors.

Fast action & smooth gameplay is one of the reasons I can't stop playing this game. Paxton Fettel takes a little getting used to. At the beginning, I was more comfortable playing as ""The Point man"", but now Fettel is my favourite character.I havn't tried Multiplayer but CO-OP sounds cool.

												F.E.A.R. 3 is a game with an identity crisis. The gunplay is fun, the score attack system is actually pretty engaging, and the asymmetrical co-op is interesting, but it's just not very scary.It tries to be, doing little spooky bits where Alma just shows up, but there's not too much there. Granted, I'm glad they didn't go ""Jump Scare!"" constantly, but there never was a feeling of dread when I was going around like a walking armory. The campaign itself is laughably short. Which is sad because, again, the feel of the guns are fantastic. Fettel's mode of body-hopping kind of calls for a run-and-gun style that is pretty enjoyable. I didn't check multiplayer, but I tried the horde mode on my own. It's fun since it boils it down to strictly the gunplay, but it would sorely require a friend or two.Comparing to the original FEAR, it's kind of strange. Once again, you're not too worried about ghosts since you're armed to the teeth, but the use of a fantastic lighting engine and robust AI makes this game look really dull. I don't know if I'd recommend this to fans of the original, or newcomers to the franchise. After every praise I think of for this game, it follows, ""but it's just not scary."" Certainly don't check this out to get spooked. At the very least I would say if you're looking for an interesting Cooperative game you could do far worse. Otherwise, just go play the first FEAR.			"

Textures are crappy as well, it's one of the worst games I've ever played.  After twenty minutes I was regretting buying it even at the offer price.  It has absolutely nothing going for it.

It is actually trying hard to scare you but you won't feel anything. Although action is good but its not as chaotic as it was before with debris and destruction. Gfx degraded as well.So what is good about this game? It emphasized alot on coop. The whole MP is coop. Get this if you want to coop 2-4 players of Black ops style, PvP coop & f*cking run. It is the only reason. Don't go for Single player.My Rating:ExcellentGreatAverageBadGraphics: AverageSound & music: AverageGameplay: AverageStory: Average			"

												77 minutes into the game and I just uninstalled it... what a waste of money and time.Where should I start? The game wouldn't launch.. so I had to search Google to find out that it has issues with DX11 and since it tries to launch with that enabled (no option anywhere to disable it), I had to manually find some switches and use those to launch in DX9....only to be greeted by a horrible narrow FOV (field of view), which on my 24"" 1920x1200 monitor looks like you are seeing the world through binoculars....Again I found a ""somewhat"" fix with another launcher switch which supposedly fixed the issue.... it was better but still....Then the gaming mechanics are horrible. Dare I say worse than FEAR 2 or even 1.Sure the graphics are a bit better, but at the end of the day, this is more of a ""demo"" with a story behind it, rather than an interactive game.Shallow shallow shallow.... I really enjoyed FEAR 1 & 2 but this one is a big disappointment.			"

												 am about done with this game. It has been fun. The graphics are very good, the sound is better than that. I have never liked games without real save game systems. Checkpoint saves are lazy. The voice acting was better than OK but repititous. The weaponry was effective even the grenades. Having to start each ""interval"" with no weapons was silly and I have never seen more helicopter/plane crashes in my life. As far as the FEAR factor it takes more than a game to scare me. The game does give ""starts"" but if you want to be afraid watch The Exorcist home alone at age 10. I like that I can play as Fettel if I want. Maybe I will. Point Man looks like the dude from Just Cause 2 or is it the other way around. Chin Ho or Kam Fong or whatever her name is has a nice butt but beyond that I am tired of games with chicks that disappear but call me on the ""phone"" regularly. Just so no one FREAKS !!!! Chin Ho is a character from Hawaii 5-0. I liked the combination of indoor and outdoor locations. The Mechs were OK but if there had been more mech I would have liked the game less. They make too much noise. The game has not crashed on me and I play it with all graphics pumped to the MAX. I captured different parts of the game using FRAPS. It is a practice of mine. There is full frontal nudity in this game. Overall I give it 8 out of 10. Will there be a FEAR 4?			"

												Excellent game 8/10, it plays smooth (played on an AMD fx 6300 CPU and GTX 970 SC EVGA GPU) and doesn't bug out. Its still gory and creepy, and still gives you that scare.  However its different compared to the last 2 games. Its implemented multiplayer mechanics into the single player campaign (collecting items for points, leveling up and receiving perks for it, ETC). It feels more of a point grabbing FPS than it should be. Its VERY linear; go in one room, clear it, go to next room, door shuts and locks behind you. It also feels slightly unplayable with the VERY LOW FOV. I had to use Steam's launch option tool to fix it.I suggest this game as it gives the FEAR universe another angle to explore and gives some closure for FEAR 2, but keep an open mind about it.			"

												Very fun and decently violent game. The game was interesting but if you're looking for the old scare factor that the FEAR series offers, then you're looking at the wrong game. This more or less turned into a cooperative shooter with the occasional predictable jump scares of Alma. I will admit thought it was a really interesting game and I was actually really invested into the story of the brothers and mother. The game however is short as hell seeing that I completed it in five hours. I think I was supposed to get more hours out of this by replaying the story with the different character but don't see much of a point when I already finished it. But if you're in the market for a shooter with your buddy, then this game can't go wrong.			"

												This game deviates from everything that made the original FEAR and it's expansions great. It includes regenerating health, cover system, extremely weak AI compared to the original, and I can't do my favorite thing anymore. That is kung foo replica soldiers to death. All of the fun has been stripped out to and replaced with call of duty elements in an effort to stay relevant, your melee attack is even a knife swing. But the FEAR series didnt need to buy into these tropes the gameplay in the first two was tense and had consequences. You were the ultimate bad♥♥♥♥♥but you had to think and use all the tools available to defeat the smart AI. Levels in the original have branching path ways and felt like real places with boosters to collect to make your health and reflexes better. Now we have a market point system that breaks the immersion of the game as an excuse to have customization. Varying enemy types had a heavier pressence in a battle, HEavy troopers would come through the wall while grunts out flank you. Now we have wave after wave of dumb always reacting the same soldiers. In every firefight i could run right up to the enemies with a shotgun and shoot them. It doesnt matter how much damage I take because I wont take enough to die and it regenerates anyway. Plus I have slo mo which is just a cop out in this game. Sometimes there are a few supernatural monsters thrown in, but it's all forced. I believe that during the production meetings they developed all of the shooter elements and while making the horror someone said, ""Just throw some scary crap in there. The game is called FEAR right?"". So sorry to say but FEAR 3 is lame, buy the original and its expansions Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate, for shooters that actually feel good to play.			"

												Sorry F.E.A.R. fans, and sorry for myself :(Remembering FEAR 2 goes back in time, FEAR 3 episode goes Forward in the story again.Acording to the story events: FEAR 2 > FEAR (and expansions) > FEAR 3Just like any blockbuster, this game lives out of the previous successes. I have seen many bad reviews, unfortunatly they were all well fundamented. The story goes around the ""Weird Family"", just like any cheap TV show, now formed by: Alma the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off dead Mum, her violent sons (we can play both), her new GI-Joe-boyfriend, and her new baby (Good Job Mr. GI Joe!!)Ok.. lets skip for goodies and badies..[Goodies]- Being able to replay the game with both brothers and use tactics according to their skills- Some visual improvement over FEAR 2 (but not much)- Some interesting ""bosses"" and get to drive a mech again =)[So so]AI: The AI looks ok, sometimes they move and change hideouts. I think FEAR 1 and 2 had a lot more fun AI. This ones just hide too much. They are predictable and we can be confident nothing fancy will happen. They do behave more realistic because I also wouldnt go out of the hideout if I was watching all my friends die =)[Badies]Where am I supposed to get chills and jump from my chair? It DID happenen in the other episodes. This game moves out of the thing that made it so interesting. Creepy stuff that wouldn't stop surprising me ( aka ""gotta-change-pants-again factor"")Sound: You dont know how I missed the comments from the enemies, full of courage or.. desperating in fear. In FEAR 3 they just say the same GI-Joe stuff through the whole game without any emotion.[Horrible!]Last the not least, the main reason for the score..I expected to play an FPS-creppy game and I was presented with a HUD full of fancy cheerful RPG stuff.Please keep the ""Mission Score"", ""Found Items"", ""Play Style scores"", ""Achievements for shooting"", ""Achievements for camping"".. bla bla bla FOR YOURSELF! Just give me a damn creepy game.Believe me, its hard to jump out of my chair at the same time a pop-up saying something like ""CONGRATS! YOU'RE RANK IS NOW PIKACHU 7"" comes on the screen. But despite falling behind in the FEAR series, its still a nice shooter.PlayTime: 13 hours (As pointman) + 1 hour (a few speedy levels with Fettel)Score: 6 / 10			"

												Its quite sad to see how the infamous F.E.A.R series degenerated to such mediocrity with this entry into the franchise. This game is like the movie equivalent of ""Matrix Reloaded + Matrix Revolutions"" which killed the Matrix series. Yes, its that bad.The third entry into the series, it tells a story of 2 brothers who is working together to re-unite with Alma, the main antagonist of the F.E.A.R series. The entire very short 5 hours story is forgettable and an extremely poor follow-up considering how powerful and thought provoking the ending of F.E.A.R 2 was.Its a very average FPS and the only interesting thing is the character Fettel who can assimilate into enemies. Level and graphic designs are very uninspired. The graphic even manage to look worse then Fear 2 which is an achievement in itself. Enemy types are also recycled (you keep seeing the same human soldiers over and over again) and the whole thing just feels very dated.There are even sequences where they put you into Mechs and you go around blasting stuff, which IMO should have been cut. as it somehow just doesn't feel like a proper F.E.A.R game with robots blasting around the place.Compared to the first 2 games in the series, the whole scare factor is just non-existent. Unless something drastic is done about it, this franchise will probably die with this game.I really want to like this game, but i am angry and jarateed off at how low the series has sunk with Fear 3. The developers should be ashamed of themselves for producing this game.Overall Rating: 3.5 / 10Unless you are a die-hard fan and wants to know how the series ends, don't waste your money on this game.

												I barely played it and don't think I'll finish it. The game is far different from the first, and can't even match the second one. They made the gameplay easy, enemies unrealistic and ridiculous, and the story doesn't even follow suit. There's co-op if you're into that, but it's like race to the finish instead of a challenge. The guns sound like .22 rounds and the shotgun can't even aim down sights. Even more so you're limited to only two guns. They try to give you ridiculous objectives to involve the point system and they are completely meaningless. Not only that the achievements are just terrible. You can lean over cover but you have to press a key to leave the cover, which can get you stuck if you try to leave and get blasted with bullets. The worst part? A girl shows up every once in a while to say hello, and tries to scare you, but just smears blood everywhere.Verdict: 4/10, this game needs revision. Highly recommend you replay the original F.E.A.R and the add ons for the real enjoyment.			"

												I had a negative review of this game for a long time... having replayed it I'm changing my mind.I hate this game for the sin of not being FEAR 2. As sequels go this is terrible. It brings nothing of the tension or atmosphere that gripped me throughout the astonishingly brilliant FEAR 2... it then uses achievements constantly popping onto the screen in bright colours to kill any residual tension or psychological edge it might have. Which is all extremely irritating and disappointing in comparison to the game it is meant to be surplanting.BUT...Forget that this is meant to be part of the FEAR franchise and assume it's an action FPS not a thriller/horror and suddenly the game looks a hell of a lot better.The gameplay is fantastic with a nice variety of enemies and locations. The weapons have all the standard options (done well) and a couple of nice exotics. The 2 main characters play incredibly different and can give the solo campaign a totally different feel and then you've got the co-op campaign with all the complexities that can bring.I'm still♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥this isn't an excellent game like it should have been... but its still very good.

												I rate the game F.E.A.R. 3 4/5. Good.This is a fairly impressive FPS game which is designed to be played either as a single player game or entirely as a co-operative game. The plot supports the co-op mode very, very well. While it has some detractors, there is far more to like about this action game than to dislike if you don't mind incredibly violent, occasionally creepy, generally dark games which focus on the family histories of psychotic telepaths.+Wraps up the previous two FEAR games (and the add-ons for each) very, very well with nearly no loose ends while still leaving the way open for yet another sequel if anyone cares to bother to create one without feeling like it has a cliff-hanger ending.+While generally this is not a very creepy game (just bloody and horrific) the game does have its moments (particularly picking your way through the haunted houses in the suburbia section of the game).+The sound and the use of the sound, from the ambient sounds of creaking wood or running feet in another room to the loud gunshots are almost uniformly outstanding. Only the grenades and explosions seemed a little muffled.+Good voice acting though enemies often did end up saying fairly repetitive things during combat and one soldier often sounded like another.+Great between level movie scenes.+Interesting (though often disjointed feeling) plot.+Outstanding and shockingly impressive graphics (the bullet time mode and effects is very well done) Great lighting effects and use of shadows as well.+The two playable characters have interesting and different abilities (but playing as the Ghostly Fettel is much, much easier than playing as the flesh and blood Point Man).+Interesting and varied environments.+This game's plot causes all of the add-on packs to become canonical.+Highly replayable game with two different endings (depending on which character you use and/or if playing in cooperative multiplayer mode, who did better on all of the previous missions. FEAR 3 is Possibly one of the best cooperative FPS gaming experiences ever designed.+Excellent enemy AI and enemy variety.+Outstanding Mech battle sequences.+Your character can only pick up two guns at a time and 3 grenades of each of the 3 types causing for much more intense combat situations and requiring you to make more complex tactical choices.+Excellent controls which support five-button gaming mice.+/- Incredibly violent (and playing one of the character's this violence will often be seen in slow bullet-time motion in painfully exquisite detail. Definitely not a good game for the weak minded or easily influenced or previously disturbed. This game contains particularly disturbing situations and images throughout.-Not extremely creepy throughout. Mostly just bloody and horrific.-This game could have used longer between level cutscenes to flesh out the plot further.-Uneven difficulty. The game is fairly difficult for the point man character but much, much easier for the ghostly Fettel character.-In single player mode the other character vanishes (which, in terms of the plot, makes some sense if you are playing the flesh and blood character but not so well if you are playing the ghost). The game should have included an AI controlled character to assist you when in the playing single player mode to stand-in for an actual person particularly as the game's design and difficulty seems to occasionally forget that you might be playing the game by yourself causing some battle situations to be extremely difficult and possibly even frustrating even on the easier (recruit) difficulty.-The plot will be difficult for newcomers to understand. This game's plot does a very poor job of standing on its own and is clearly intended for those who had played not just the first two games but possibly all of the add-on packs as well.-Relatively short game with only 2 endings.-Fairly linear gameplay and level design. The mech battle sequences, while well done and very atmospheric are particularly linear.-This game has irritating HUD indicators. Text telling you to reload if your clip is not totally full. Stupid on-screen crosshairs that you cannot turn off.-Mediocre music throughout which succeeds only in setting the right tone but fails to be truly catchy or very interesting.			"

It is actually trying hard to scare you but you won't feel anything. Although action is good but its not as chaotic as it was before with debris and destruction. Gfx degraded as well.So what is good about this game? It emphasized alot on coop. The whole MP is coop. Get this if you want to coop 2-4 players of Black ops style, PvP coop & f*cking run. It is the only reason. Don't go for Single player.My Rating:ExcellentGreatAverageBadGraphics: AverageSound & music: AverageGameplay: AverageStory: Average			"

												This is a great game, It is realistic {if you allow it to be} especially if you play with the lights out and headphones on with volume up. There are some moments that  do genuinly make you jump.the graphics are very good and I wish my system was a little better just to get the maximum benefit of the graphics.Would I recommend this game to others...............?  With my diying breath I would. The only thing I would change is giving the Charature the absolute freedom to roam anywhere, ie jump fences, climb walls ( all within the laws of gravity ), freedom in a simular way to Prototype.Out of the 18 people I've recommended it to, 13 are now playing it and brought it for themselves.Many many thanks to the game makers and producers for a job wonderfully done and I hope we will see another instalment soon. { sorry for any bad spelling it is not one of my strong points :)  }			"

The cover feature and slomo is sweet and the graphics, while not the latest and greatest, are well done and enjoyable. It's playing like a solid shooter and runs smoothly even on a dual core with no lag. I haven't tried it on my quad core yet.			"

												This is a difficult one. In terms of production quality the game is pretty well done. Shooting enemies and seeing them blow apart and bullet holes everywhere and it can be fun but aside from the entertaining aspect everything else lacks. The story is quite slow and very linear. No major plot points, from the begining you know the end (or at least can predict it) and there aren't a lot of enemy types. You're primarily fighting soldiers or possesed people and the occasional ""bigger"" thug. Honestly the mechanics were the only things that kept me playing this game.			"

												I love the Fear series, and this game...well it does things quite differently. First off, there's co-op, and without a doubt that makes the experience in this game much better. You're working together with your friend as well as against, competing for your character's respective ending. The combat's quite different, especially with the inclusion of Fettel, the ""ghost"" you can play as, and brother to the main character. The story doesn't take very long to complete, so I'd suggest waiting to get this game at a discount price. And heck, then you can get the game as a ""two-for-the-price-of-one"" deal, maybe even cheaper than the current set price if you're lucky. It's one of those co-op games, so grab a buddy and enjoy!

												This game far exceeded my expectations. It delivers in almost every category where FEAR 1 and 2 shined. The only exception is the length of the campaign, which is comparatively shorter. However, with the addition of coop campaign mode and the wide variety of multiplayer modes, the shorter campaign duration is easily overlooked. The coop campaign mode is very fun and very well balanced. The multiplayer adds refreshing new dynamics to the game while also adding new and unique feelings of suspense. One mode in particular, called ""F****ing Run!"" is nothing short of a constant adrenaline rush. Fear 3 easily earns a 9 out of 10 in my book.Note: I edited this recommendation in response to a major patch.			"

												FEAR 3 is similar to FEAR 2 on first glance however the key feature to this game which I think makes it the most interesting before even getting started on the plot is the new 'coop' gameplay.In this game you can play as the 'pointman' as in the first FEAR or as player 2 play as 'Paxton Fetel' who has the ability to possess enemies and take control of them from a first person perspective while being able to use everything the enemy has on them.This game has a points system even in single player and although its meant to be horror the elements of competitive gameplay features have emerged.

												Like the other fear titles F3AR is showing it's age but still provides solid fun. The graphics are a little muddy in places and the engine groans under the weight of the poor outdoor sections. Having said that as with the first two games enviromental design, particularly the interiors, and the art direction is fantastic leading to some truly unique locales and great lighting. The combat is fast paced and fun but seldom rises above the average shooter tropes. Enemies like to flank you and use grenades which is a nice change from the increasingly banal pop up targets of the COD genre.  The story is a little ridiculous at this point and if you are considering by a game for plot then you probably want to look elsewhere. Overall F3AR is a good game that treads the fine line between average and exciting and falls towards the former a little too often. Pick it up if it's a rainy weekend and you want a little bit of mindless shooting fun. 7/10			"

												I really, really wanted to like this game...but I'm ever so grateful I picked it up on sale.  The first thing I noticed was that the gun play was 'sedated', meaning that there was no punch to weapon impacts.  Any of the charm of the old school FPS feel that was present in F.E.A.R. and F.E.A.R. 2 is completely gone, and it's been replaced with a very putrid, banal color scheme ala Call of Duty Modern Warfare.Graphics quality is sub par.  Scares are nonexistent.  Story line is as cliche as it gets.  This is yet another franchise killed chasing after mainstream dollars that it never had a shot at getting in the first place.

Multiplayer has tons of modes and maps, like clearing waves etc...As you might know original F.E.A.R. was scary horror game, this is NOT although sometimes there is scary part...For me F.E.A.R. 3 is is the worst game in F.E.A.R universe, maybe because Monolith (studio which made F.E.A.R and F.E.A.R 2) did not make this game.Fail - 6/10			"

												Fear 3 is kinda like the orphaned abused brother to a successful family. It's filled with too much crap to really be anything, but generally gets through by giving people what they want, regardless of wether its actually beneficial to its own survival or not.Fear 3 is very try hardWith that out of the way, fear 3 is basically a mix of everything shooters have today, thrown into a goulash of ultra confusing and cluttered ""SHOOT EVERYTHINGHAKKG"" gameplay.Storyline? two guys hate eachother, one dies, the end. Then babies.How it feels? it's a console game through and through, playing it on a pc feels clunky and slow. ""BUT THE SLOW MO"" I hear you all crying out. Well it's here, they just ripped out everything good and hucked it at your face, and laughed. The slowmo drains much to fast, and mixed with clunky controls and last gen graphics, you'll be shooting at walls most of the time.But if you want a finale to a series, wether its crummy or not, here you go.

												F.E.A.R 3 is a game I got in a pack from the Humble Bundle and is the first of the series I have actually completed, this review will focus mostly on a co-op playthrough experience. I'll start with the positives, since there aren't many. Firstly, the Fettel (Ghost guy) character had some interesting powers and I thought it made him a little different to the Point Man character, which was good to make the experience a little different for each player. Secondly, the Mechs were fun to run around in for the little while you really had to use them. Now, on to the negative aspects. The game is incredibly repetitive, tossing the same enemies at you level after level, having very little weapon variety among other things. Another aspect which didn't work as intended was the cover system, as enemies seem to be able to hit you from behind the ""cover"" you can take with a key press, making it a useless option to even have within the game. The final negative point I need to bring up is the lack of horror, the game contains no real ""scary"" moments at all, making little to no attempt to include some of the creepy atmosphere you might have found in older F.E.A.R games. Overall, I'd say to give this game a miss. Its around six hours (on nightmare difficulty) of repetitive timewasting, with little to no redeeming factors or unique features. If you are looking for a horror game, try the older F.E.A.R games, if you are looking for an FPS game, there are plenty of better examples, if you are looking for a co-op game, try something like Borderlands 2 or a gamemode for Garry's Mod.

												I don't think any of the reviewers gave this game a fair chance. There's an amazing shooter here, obscured by cheap horror tricks that failed to scare me 2 games ago and the predictable story. Day 1 Studio's take on F.E.A.R. is simply an ultra-gory action romp, and should be taken as such. When that's out of the way, the game's centrepiece comes into focus: the shooting. This is maybe one of the only games that gets the modern shooting model right. The cover system here never feels cheap or clumsy and never becomes a bore because the AI soldiers work in perfect synergy with one another to flank, frag and shoot down any cover you're trying to exploit. The shooting is tight and satisfying and kept at a fast pace because of the regenerating health. In Co-op, this game is just amazing. Pointman's slow motion allows him to take out whole swaths of enemies in between taking cover and perferming satisfying headshots while slowing time, while Fettel is a bad♥♥♥♥♥with the way he jumps into the fray by possessing people and murdering them close-up. There is a pretty deep achievement system here meant to have the two players compete and a levelling system that I've maxed out at level 21. The 4 multiplayer modes are really strong and not what you find in other shooters. In fact, the contractions (horde) mode is actually pretty intense, complete with randomnly generated Alma. A pity they are all dead right now. I've played through the campaign 4 times on increasing difficulties and somehow...the shooting keeps bringing me back.			"

However, once you play, you will find it stands on it's own as something a little more unique and genuinely fun if you are into fast-pased FPS gameplay.

												F.3.A.R is a good game that has its unique gameplay. From way before the F.E.A.R franchise F.E.A.R 1 was a very scary game with a lot of scary moments that you didnt expect, F.E.A.R 2: Project Origin had scary moments that were either scary or okayish, and unfortunlly F.3.A.R scary moments just make you gasp thats it, nothing like jumping off the chair. Despite its lack of scary moments, F.3.A.R campaign and multiplayer is very fun. Like all shooter games the campaign is short but at least the multiplayer is very different then other shooters. The only problem is that theres no one that plays F.3.A.R multiplayer now these days so you might need to grab a friend. This game features Excellent Co-op campaign, Very good multiplayer, bad scary moments, and Ranking up.

You need to beat the game with Point Man to unlock Fettel.pros: catered to run on the PC, good combat (especially with the mech sections), AI is competent, varied maps, great atmospherecons: not much different from FEAR2 (especially the visuals), some fps drops during set pieces, lacking effective ""horror"", AI can get buggy, the last interval could of been a lot less annoying, Fettel is required to be unlocked, and multiplayer is a ghost town so I can't review itIf you enjoyed FEAR2 then this game is worth checking out.

												77 minutes into the game and I just uninstalled it... what a waste of money and time.Where should I start? The game wouldn't launch.. so I had to search Google to find out that it has issues with DX11 and since it tries to launch with that enabled (no option anywhere to disable it), I had to manually find some switches and use those to launch in DX9....only to be greeted by a horrible narrow FOV (field of view), which on my 24"" 1920x1200 monitor looks like you are seeing the world through binoculars....Again I found a ""somewhat"" fix with another launcher switch which supposedly fixed the issue.... it was better but still....Then the gaming mechanics are horrible. Dare I say worse than FEAR 2 or even 1.Sure the graphics are a bit better, but at the end of the day, this is more of a ""demo"" with a story behind it, rather than an interactive game.Shallow shallow shallow....

												Игра интересна мне из-за того, что когда-то, я играл в первые две части этой игры и они мне понравились. Но столкнувшись с этой частью я немного разочаровался. Игра к середине игры быстро набирает темп, а затем сбавляет и это мне не очень понравилось. Сюжет стал более тухловатым, игра не пугает. Я так и не могу собраться с силами чтобы пройти ее до конца.

												(6/10)Its another fear game, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I think in this outing they really tried very hard to 'modernize' the formula with what in the end is a somewhat tacked on and rather un-necessary cover system.  It doesn't really heighten the tension of the game, and kind of undoes some of the overal feel of the time warping when instead of being an amazing time warping marine badass, you spend a good portion of the game hunkered down behind a box.The overall package isn't awful, it just never fully gels into one cohesive 'game' to play, its constantly wavering back and forth between the old/new systems.

												Well, all I can say is that it lasted 6 hours.If you liked the previous FEAR games don't even bother playing this one, it doesn't even deserve being called FEAR.It's more like... ""A lame PS3 game we made because it will sell itself because of the name"".The storyline it's terrible, it doesn't bring anything new to the main storyline of the previous games, it is just a bad ending to it, making FEAR 2 pointless.I really enjoyed some creepy locations, but that's all they were, just creepy locations. There are few enemy types and the combats are always the same.What I find that it really broke the climax of the game was this ""competitive"" touch they want to put in... You level up pointlessly (because the skills you gain are nothing exciting) and those ""achievements"" totally break the aesthetic of the game and the gameplay itself.So, if you want my oppinion, buy this game if you can get it for 75cents, play it a boring sunday afternoon and then go back to the old ones so they can wipe out the bad taste that this one leaves.

												I loved playing the original Fear and Like other reviews I think it was unique. I didn't play Fear 3 until recently and It has decent graphics and controls. I like that it has co-op to play with friends. The multi-player with the possession ability is interesting. I got it on sale for just $5 , So I have nothing  to complain about at that price. I think if it had a map editor available at release, players would have gotten more mileage out of the game. I did a google search and didn't find any real info on Fear 3 map editing. I did see some mention of Fear 1 map editing.For $5 its a good buy, IMO			"

												Even though this is vastly diFFerent from the previous installments, it was immensely fun to play with a friend. The previous games were more focused with the horror and less on the action, whereas F.E.A.R. 3 is more action oriented and has the horror theme, but not the actual horror itself.For me it was a nice change of pace and expanded upon the story in a great way. Visually appealing and fun gameplay made for a good time.			"

When there is a boss around, you'd best keep an eye on them or else you're going to fail sooooooo hard.I had tremendous fun with this game, especially in the boss scenes, and double boss scenes.I thought the Graphics looked outdated in magazines, etc, BUT i was pleasantly suprised to find they were quite excellent.A word to the developers: ""It's all the little small things, that were totally unexpected, that you put in this game, that show just how much effort was gone to try and make this perfect.

												Terrible gameplay. FEAR 2 was a pretty amazing game but it looks like the gameplay just took a nosedive for FEAR 3. Shooting is not fun, the shotgun just doesn't work the same, the enemies are annoying as they shoot blindly from behind cover so all you basically have to do is run up and melee them. One of the worst things is that they took away the health bar and armor so that its basically call of duty style where you take damage, hide in cover for the appropriate amount of time and magically you're fully healed. All parts of the gameplay are just massive downgrades from its predecessor, even the bullet time just doesn't feel right. I wanted to enjoy the game because I loved FEAR 2 and the storyline was pretty gripping but there's just no way I can deal with playing through this entire game. Enjoy the previous games and just save yourself the trouble and skip this one.			"

												Pretty silly and unsubtle but I played it with my wife and it's actually a very good co-op game. You can play the whole main campaign with a friend and each character has unique abilities that compliment each other, encouraging strategic collaboration and communication between partners. Of course it's impossible to have an impactful horror atmosphere when you're spending time with a buddy but if you adjust your expectations accordingly it's a good shooter and action game.I played the first game but didn't spend significant time with the second, but this was enough to help me appreciate where the story was coming from. That being said, you don't really have to play the previous games and can jump right into this one.I can't speak to the solo game but I imagine it's not as enjoyable as co-op. Get this and play with a friend for maximum enjoyment. It's one of the better co-op shooters you will find.			"

												I've come to this sequel right after finishing FEAR 2, and, having read a lot of negative reviews, had low expectations. Fortunately, it's been a positive surprise so far, in light of that. No, it's not scary at all, that's true -- so real hardcore fans of the previous episodes may very well feel disappointed --, but it's quite an okay shooter/action game with its own little twists and a distinct, intriguingly dark mood. Let me repeat: it won't scare you, but if you're willing to go along, you'll get immersed. I also think I can appreciate how a new team of developers (afaik) managed to add their own to the story and to the world as well. Because there's a strong connection indeed.As some said, it's a solid game - it won't turn your world upside down, it won't give you what the previous episodes did, but it's definitely fun. (Especially if you manage to fix the initial resolution issue, which is a terrible bug indeed. I had to use a hexa editor and manually tweak certain files to get the game display properly on my screen.)			"

												The skinny: FEAR 3 is superior to FEAR 2 in just about every way. Much better gunplay. nicer level design and a better story. Is it a great game? No, not quite. Your enemies are still too bullet spongey and the creatures that come out of the walls might be some of the most annoying in gaming history. Some of the mini boss fights can be frustrating and the aim of the game is still to go from Point A to Pointt B. There is some replay value as once you finish the game with the Point Man, you can replay the game as Paxton Fettel. Or you can play co-op with one player as Point Man and the other as Fettel. That's a great option to have. All in all I'd definitely recommend FEAR 3. If you can get this in the $5 range (which it has been before) or preferably  with the rest of the FEAR series for around $14 you'll get a lot of bang for your buck. 8/10 from me.			"

												If you haven't played the first two games in the series before thins one, play those first and play this one if you really want to see the ending.I enjoyed F.3.A.R, but not as a FEAR game. It's a fun shooter, but the horror is lacklustre, the story's muddled and the AI is dumb.The upshot of this game is the ability to play it in multiplayer, either in challenges and things or as a coop/competetive campaign. This was a really nice addition, but it still doesn't really fit in a FEAR game.I can't think of anything in the first two F.E.A.R games that really made no sense or wasn't explained through the collectible lore drops or the story, In F.3.A.R a lot of stuff goes unexplained. There are points in the game where normal enemy soldiers, rather than walk in, or get airlifted in or something like that, they literally walk out of walls or are formed from lightning, with no explanation apart from some crap about ""but psychics"".Moreover I just found the enemies in F.3.A.R. just aren't as interesting as in the previous games, There's a recurring antagonist in the game referred to only as The Creep, how or why The Creep is in the form he takes is never explained, and virtually contradicts the previous two games A whole bunch of aspects in F.3.A.R. just seem to contradict the first two games' story, albeit sometime only the inferred story. in the first two games the actions of the character's are somewhat justified, whereas in F.3.A.R. the motivation is hard to see. Pros Fun gun-playNeat atmosphereLooks good, though somewhat dated nowFun multiplayer game optionsMech levels allow for on foot progression for those who desire a challenge Cons Horror relies on jumpscares many of which fall flatStory is a bit of a messNot a huge amount of enemy variationScrew those cultist enemies, numerous and bland Doesn't feel like a FEAR gameIt's a pretty good game, worth getting on sale or if you just want to see how the story ends, or if you want a good shooter.If you want a great FEAR game go replay one of the first two.

												I played this game because I was in the mood for some scares, but ended up with a bunch of feels that I didn't know what to do with.Honestly, I see a lot of people poo-pooing this game for having a bad plot, messing up the series, blah dee blah...But I absolutely loved it.The strange love/hate relationship between the two brothers is something I found to be very tragic and engaging. Unlike the past two games, this one humanized Alma and Paxton to the point where I actually sympathized with them, and the final scenes (both ""good"" and ""bad"") left me torn. Both brothers have been deeply wronged, and it was fascinating how each one dealt with their past... With Paxton choosing vengeance no matter the cost, and Point Man choosing to not give up on mankind, which in turn gave way to mercy.Maybe I'm just a sap, but this game is going to stick with me for a long time.

												Sorry F.E.A.R. fans, and sorry for myself :(Remembering FEAR 2 goes back in time, FEAR 3 episode goes Forward in the story again.Acording to the story events: FEAR 2 > FEAR (and expansions) > FEAR 3Just like any blockbuster, this game lives out of the previous successes. I have seen many bad reviews, unfortunatly they were all well fundamented. The story goes around the ""Weird Family"", just like any cheap TV show, now formed by: Alma the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off dead Mum, her violent sons (we can play both), her new GI-Joe-boyfriend, and her new baby (Good Job Mr. GI Joe!!)Ok.. lets skip for goodies and badies..[Goodies]- Being able to replay the game with both brothers and use tactics according to their skills- Some visual improvement over FEAR 2 (but not much)- Some interesting ""bosses"" and get to drive a mech again =)[So so]AI: The AI looks ok, sometimes they move and change hideouts. I think FEAR 1 and 2 had a lot more fun AI. This ones just hide too much. They are predictable and we can be confident nothing fancy will happen. They do behave more realistic because I also wouldnt go out of the hideout if I was watching all my friends die =)[Badies]Where am I supposed to get chills and jump from my chair? It DID happenen in the other episodes. This game moves out of the thing that made it so interesting. Creepy stuff that wouldn't stop surprising me ( aka ""gotta-change-pants-again factor"")Sound: You dont know how I missed the comments from the enemies, full of courage or.. desperating in fear. In FEAR 3 they just say the same GI-Joe stuff through the whole game without any emotion.[Horrible!]Last the not least, the main reason for the score..I expected to play an FPS-creppy game and I was presented with a HUD full of fancy cheerful RPG stuff.Please keep the ""Mission Score"", ""Found Items"", ""Play Style scores"", ""Achievements for shooting"", ""Achievements for camping"".. bla bla bla FOR YOURSELF! Just give me a damn creepy game.Believe me, its hard to jump out of my chair at the same time a pop-up saying something like ""CONGRATS! YOU'RE RANK IS NOW PIKACHU 7"" comes on the screen. But despite falling behind in the FEAR series, its still a nice shooter.PlayTime: 13 hours (As pointman) + 1 hour (a few speedy levels with Fettel)Score: 6 / 10			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 follows directly after F.E.A.R. 2 but has very little of a connection to F.E.A.R. 1 since certain events never happened due to the Monolith and Vivendi timeline of F.E.A.R. being a bit different. In short, it's two different story lines, but none the less a good idea to play the predecessors in order to have an idea of what is going on in the game. The developers did an excellent job when it came to playability. I've spent hours playing this game over and over again, doing achievement hunting and completing the game in Co-Op mode (probably the best feature) with my friends. The greatest disappointment (in my opinion) is that fact that they moved away from the horror elements of the game. Don't get me wrong, there are a couple of scares in the game, but it's not nearly as intense as its predecessors. This shouldn't discourage you to play the game, because what lacks in horror the game makes up for in playability. A few multiplayer modes have been added that makes it so much fun to play. Like its predecessors, I highly recommend that you give this a shot, it's a great game with a great story line!			"

												A guilty pleasureThis manages to stand next to Mass Effect 3 for the worst ending in a ""trilogy"" series. Story-wise it's horribly written and leaves more questions than answers about Pointman, Fettel, and especially Alma. A sloppy mess.Now the GAME is fun. Although it has ""we want call of duty's audience"" written all over with with brown&bloom, ranking up, and crosshair hit confirmation... it still manages to be even more fast-paced than the first two without deviating from its roots. The campaign is best designed for co-op, so grab a buddy (or me) and have a blast.You can play one of two characters: Pointman and Fettel. Pointman plays as every FEAR game before, carrying an armory on his back and having bullet-time at will. Fettel is REALLY fun playing as a blood mage ghost sort of deal. You have precise shotgun blood-blasts, an enemy hold, a channeled shield for Pointman, and you can posess the bodies of enemies to fight ala-pointman style.			"

												I rate the game F.E.A.R. 3 4/5. Good.This is a fairly impressive FPS game which is designed to be played either as a single player game or entirely as a co-operative game. The plot supports the co-op mode very, very well. While it has some detractors, there is far more to like about this action game than to dislike if you don't mind incredibly violent, occasionally creepy, generally dark games which focus on the family histories of psychotic telepaths.+Wraps up the previous two FEAR games (and the add-ons for each) very, very well with nearly no loose ends while still leaving the way open for yet another sequel if anyone cares to bother to create one without feeling like it has a cliff-hanger ending.+While generally this is not a very creepy game (just bloody and horrific) the game does have its moments (particularly picking your way through the haunted houses in the suburbia section of the game).+The sound and the use of the sound, from the ambient sounds of creaking wood or running feet in another room to the loud gunshots are almost uniformly outstanding. Only the grenades and explosions seemed a little muffled.+Good voice acting though enemies often did end up saying fairly repetitive things during combat and one soldier often sounded like another.+Great between level movie scenes.+Interesting (though often disjointed feeling) plot.+Outstanding and shockingly impressive graphics (the bullet time mode and effects is very well done) Great lighting effects and use of shadows as well.+The two playable characters have interesting and different abilities (but playing as the Ghostly Fettel is much, much easier than playing as the flesh and blood Point Man).+Interesting and varied environments.+This game's plot causes all of the add-on packs to become canonical.+Highly replayable game with two different endings (depending on which character you use and/or if playing in cooperative multiplayer mode, who did better on all of the previous missions. FEAR 3 is Possibly one of the best cooperative FPS gaming experiences ever designed.+Excellent enemy AI and enemy variety.+Outstanding Mech battle sequences.+Your character can only pick up two guns at a time and 3 grenades of each of the 3 types causing for much more intense combat situations and requiring you to make more complex tactical choices.+Excellent controls which support five-button gaming mice.+/- Incredibly violent (and playing one of the character's this violence will often be seen in slow bullet-time motion in painfully exquisite detail. Definitely not a good game for the weak minded or easily influenced or previously disturbed. This game contains particularly disturbing situations and images throughout.-Not extremely creepy throughout. Mostly just bloody and horrific.-This game could have used longer between level cutscenes to flesh out the plot further.-Uneven difficulty. The game is fairly difficult for the point man character but much, much easier for the ghostly Fettel character.-In single player mode the other character vanishes (which, in terms of the plot, makes some sense if you are playing the flesh and blood character but not so well if you are playing the ghost). The game should have included an AI controlled character to assist you when in the playing single player mode to stand-in for an actual person particularly as the game's design and difficulty seems to occasionally forget that you might be playing the game by yourself causing some battle situations to be extremely difficult and possibly even frustrating even on the easier (recruit) difficulty.-The plot will be difficult for newcomers to understand. This game's plot does a very poor job of standing on its own and is clearly intended for those who had played not just the first two games but possibly all of the add-on packs as well.-Relatively short game with only 2 endings.-Fairly linear gameplay and level design. The mech battle sequences, while well done and very atmospheric are particularly linear.-This game has irritating HUD indicators. Text telling you to reload if your clip is not totally full. Stupid on-screen crosshairs that you cannot turn off.-Mediocre music throughout which succeeds only in setting the right tone but fails to be truly catchy or very interesting.			"

Some nice gunplay reminisent of the original FEAR but the story is such a badly put together mess that it destroyes anything great the second game in the series had built up. Not to mention the Single Player game is so obviously constructed around a co-op experience that any one playing it on their own ala previous games will find them selves with a large mountain to climb in regards to enemy numbers.Such a shame. 5/10			"

												I hate this game so much. It’s so unbelievably generic and bland, it’s sad to see this game use the fear name. The story is so awful, the reason why I liked the story in the first game was even though it was stupid it was subtle and mysterious but here they just went full ret*rd with the plot and the fear storyline. Fettel feels like a cartoon character with his design and voice acting and they actually gave pointman a face, a ret*arded, generic white guy face. Gameplay is very boring and dull, guns feel and sound awful, shooting is not satisfying and the enemy ai is really bad. You can’t even compare how awful the shooting is compared to how masterfully done the the gunplay was in the first game. The games art design and level design is disgusting. It’s all brown and grey absolutely no colour to the game at all and the level design is so bland and forgettable. The scares in this game are so laughable, just the thought that it is actually supposed to scare you is funny. Either the developers did not care or they have no talent or direction. This game has no redeeming qualities at all, it killed the franchise.  2/10 (Awful)			"

												Well, all I can say is that it lasted 6 hours.If you liked the previous FEAR games don't even bother playing this one, it doesn't even deserve being called FEAR.It's more like... ""A lame PS3 game we made because it will sell itself because of the name"".The storyline it's terrible, it doesn't bring anything new to the main storyline of the previous games, it is just a bad ending to it, making FEAR 2 pointless.I really enjoyed some creepy locations, but that's all they were, just creepy locations. There are few enemy types and the combats are always the same.What I find that it really broke the climax of the game was this ""competitive"" touch they want to put in... You level up pointlessly (because the skills you gain are nothing exciting) and those ""achievements"" totally break the aesthetic of the game and the gameplay itself.So, if you want my oppinion, buy this game if you can get it for 75cents, play it a boring sunday afternoon and then go back to the old ones so they can wipe out the bad taste that this one leaves.

												I enjoyed FEAR, FEAR Extraction Point and FEAR 2: Project Origin (even if Project Origin was rather short it didn't stop me enjoying the 6 hours of gameplay I went through) so when I started seeing the negative comments and reviews for FEAR 3 I was some what confused as to how bad the game could be. As it turns out, all of these negative reviews have very very good points. I've literally just finished the first interval of this game and I can already see major flaws in gameplay which take away points for this franchise.NEGATIVE POINTS-AI are dumber than door nailsAt points in the first mission I witnessed at least several cases of incompitant AI. The shotgunners rush your position constantly and won't stop, not even to take cover, until either you drop or they do. AI seem adamant to hug every damn grenade thrown their way with some AI going as far as to throw grenades at themselves and not give two s*its. AI seem to like shooting at indestructable objects such as CHAIN LINK FENCES(?) and BULLET PROOF WINDOWS that you are behind. For me this made all enemies which I came accross turn into nothing but moving targets which took away most of the fun in the game for me.-Jump ScaresYep...Good ol' jump scares (sarcasm). FEAR and FEAR Extraction point earned their name sake by creating a very tense, suspension filled and dark atmosphere almost all the way throughout the game with minimal jump scares. For me, I prefer the atmosphere in anything to do with horror whether it's a horror movie or a horror game, atmosphere is what I want not some generic sudden appearance of a supernatural force followed by a loud sound effect. I want to feel genuinley scared or on edge during a horror experience. I want adrenaline to be coursing through my body at every interval during this game but that's not going to happen thanks to just five seconds of the screen going dark and Alma walking around with whispers in the background.-Regenerating HealthRegenerating health is not usually a problem for me as long as health regeneration is balanced for the style of gameplay like after an area is cleared of enemies health can then regenerate at a slow pace and this only applies if regenerating health is in place throught any previous games of the same franchise. In this case however FEAR 3 absolutely ruins the difficulty in this game by having a fast paced regenerating health system during combat.-XP and Ranking system...in a linear single player Story modeXP and ranking is fine for online play or in a open world sandbox style game such as TES:5, FALLOUT 3/NV or Borderlands and Mass Effect but having a linear story mode with an XP/Ranking system? Not even the Call of Duty franchise has implemented something that stupid and useless in their campaigns...and their campaigns since after World at War were♥♥♥♥♥♥ You have to unlock abilities with ranking up which the Point Man should already have from the first game...-Only two weapon slotsHaving only two weapon slots is such a disadvantage in a FEAR game as ammo is usually found in very small amounts on corpses and in little supply crates. Not only is ammo an issue but what if you decide to swap out empty heavy weapons for weapons like the pistol and submachine gun which have ammo and you have to fight some big bad Mutha F*cker with heavy armor and weapons which small arms are nothing but a damn tickle to him? You're going to get wrecked because you have only two weapons which do nothing and yet on FEAR and FEAR 2 you could just pull a missile launcher out your a*s and keep those weapons with ammo tucked safely between your butt cheeks whilst you just destroy the guy.POSITIVE POINTS-It gave me something to do for 20 or so minutesNow with all these problems (which are problems that I personally find annoying) that I found in the first damn interval, I have now just completely given up on playing the rest of the game.

												This game hasn't really improved upon F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin but is still a fun game to play. You basically play as Point Man, whom was the protagonist in the first F.E.A.R. game that was considered to be the best shooter of 2005. This game starts off by you being tortured in a jail cell by two gaurds and you have to escape to find Jin Sun Kwon. Here's where the plot problems come into play. The game doesn't tell you where or how you got to where you started, it just puts you there out of the blue, with no relation whatsoever to extraction point.The gameplay is like a basic first-person shooter with mechanics such as taking cover and jumping over obstacles. It's good but I hardly used it at all since how that controls is just hard to get used to. You also posses bullet time which allows you to slow down time and shoot at enemies much quicker and easier. This makes the game realitvly easy in the beginning but you will be greatful that you have it since the game gets realitvly hard and frustrating near the end.The major complaint I had with this game was that the game's difficulty is completly unfair when playing solo. Here's what I mean by that: When you have to fight the two commanders near the end of the second last level, you will die probably 10-20 times at least untill one of them gets hung up on the wall while you kill the other. Seriously if it wasn't for that I would be stuck here still trying to beat that part; it's just impossible.It's not a very good game but it's still a good game so I would still recommend you play this.

												I've always been a fan of the Fear games. While their gameplay wasn't the best, it was still highly entertaining and had just enough horror to keep me shaking in my booties.Fear 3 takes a step into a deep dark part of the gaming world, co-op. For a Horror game, co-op ultimately ruins the tension in the game. Is this true for Fear 3? Ha, there was little horror left in the game other than the obvious jump scares and random moving chairs. Fear 3 is BARELY a horror game. It's more of a creepy looking game with gore and guns.But the strange thing is... I like it. I enjoyed running around wrecking my enemies. They never stood a GHOST of a chance! (That there is a Paxton Fettel joke... because he is dead) While I enjoyed the game, playing single player alone just didn't cut it for me. It wasn't worth spending the money on it at that point. However, co-op is where I was sold on this game.In co-op one person takes on the mute, bullet dodging hitman called... Point man (yeah screw good names!) and the other takes on the role of the invulnerable ghost of Paxton Fettel. Point man can basically bullet time his way around the place while Paxton, being the what is basically the most powerful psychic person in this universe, can take over bodies at will and have a taste of what it is like being a weak Point Man. Now I know this sounds kind of terrible but playing as Paxton gives you so many options. You can be a great support for Point Man. You can outright blast enemies or take them over as your temporary body. Now staying within the body is not forever and you will have to get another but until then, enjoy the shoot 'em up. While you would think being Point man sucks, it does have it's high points. You easily can get mechs, powersuits and other cool gadgets to take over and run wild in. (Paxton can get them as well by the way but he might bleed out before getting into one)Working as a team and dealing with all of the different difficult enemies thrown your way is really crazy fun. I enjoyed the feel of the weapons and how enemies reacted. You blast an enemy with a shotgun and he either gets knocked back or becomes bits. Shooting limbs and heads feel really good in the game, if not very rewarding.There is collectables that are actually important as well! You basically get these to increase the time in which you can either be in slow motion or take over a body.Now the story is forgettable at best as, I only remember the ""Brother"" jokes I was making as I pointed to my forehead (Again, another Paxton joke). Still, of what story there is, there is some seriously WTH moments in the game. And an ending you will literally fight over.As a co-op and a thinly lined multiplayer experience, I can recommend this game as cheap fun. As a single player experience, you really must be wanting to shoot something to come here for it.Co-op is 8 Paxtons out of 10.Single Player is 6 slowmotion punches out of 10Multiplayer is 7 Almas out of 10.Pick it up cheap and you will have no fears.

												Just got this one and it's just as great as the first and probably better than the second title. The ability to play as Paxton Fettel after finishing the game is also great. Possessing your enemies and using their own weapons against them was an excellent idea. It's more combat-oriented than the first game, probably as much so as the second, but still atmospheric and has its scary bits.			"

												If you play this game, please play it with a friend.  It was FANTASTIC to play it with someone I know.  The game is quite short if you go straight through the campaign (5-6 hours), so I would recommend getting it on sale.  This game has jump scares, it has camp, it has a terrible pun.  It was SO FUN that I have a new love for the F.E.A.R. series.  I was cracking up throughout the game on voice chat with my friend.  If you play it with someone you know, I think it has some good replayability.The co-op is alot of fun!  Very different play styles depending on if you are Point Man or Fettel.  There are also opportunities to compliment one another as well as opportunities to compete against each other.  Seriously, I had a great time with this game.			"

												What's great is that you get to play as Fettel. Assuming the role of Point Man gets you a fun fast-paced shooter with unalienable slo-mo. But playing as Fettel nets you the ability to possess enemies, and when they expire - they explode in a burst of blood!The game's length is on the shorter end of the spectrum, but on the bright side - you can finish the whole thing in co-op mode in a single afternoon. Additionally, the co-op mode is a great boost to the replay value.This game as not as creepy-scary as the original, and I started to get skeptical about the amount of scares - until I started interval 4 (the suburbs). This interval alone is worth the money in my opinion; that was the best of classic FEAR!The controls are very convenient, enabling the player to assign the same key to mutually-exclusive actions (for the most part). Audio is solid; soundtrack is non-invasive and at times feels very right for the circumstances.To sum it up, this game is a fun fast-paced shooter, and can be enjoyed not just by the FEAR veterans, but also the FEAR newbies.

												This is a great game, It is realistic {if you allow it to be} especially if you play with the lights out and headphones on with volume up. There are some moments that  do genuinly make you jump.the graphics are very good and I wish my system was a little better just to get the maximum benefit of the graphics.Would I recommend this game to others...............?  With my diying breath I would. The only thing I would change is giving the Charature the absolute freedom to roam anywhere, ie jump fences, climb walls ( all within the laws of gravity ), freedom in a simular way to Prototype.Out of the 18 people I've recommended it to, 13 are now playing it and brought it for themselves.Many many thanks to the game makers and producers for a job wonderfully done and I hope we will see another instalment soon. { sorry for any bad spelling it is not one of my strong points :)  }			"

												I was never really a big fan of the F.E.A.R. franchise, but this is too much, and not in a good way.Let's start with some good things:- the graphics in the game are pretty decent and good looking- the shooting style is good- it has co-op (favorite thing)Bad things:- the game is way to short (finished it for 5 hours)- not nearly as scary as the first two games- gets boring really soon (although it is so short)- the ""story"" is just stupid and almost non-existent Overall, if you can get it for a few coins and play it with a friend maybe, but just MAYBE, you should get it.If it wasn't for the co-op I wouldn't even finish the game. The last 2 hours of the gameplay I was just waiting for the game to end, and there is part where you are on a highway in a mecha or something for an hour, sounds awesome, but it isn't at all.I give it:3/10p.s. 3 points for available co-op.

												Well what can I say. Let's talk about gameplay. It's terrible. Yes the game may be a relatively small install but the replayability is pretty low. You can play as Point Man and then later unlock Fettel for the same level and experience different styles of combat and gameplay, not to mention that you can also go on co-op. The mutliplayer modes are well thought out and fun to play with different game types spanning possession, fighting against hordes of enemies; however it does become repetitive quickly.The storyline suffers from major plotholes. And it's terrible. Oh my is it terrible. I'm not saying that F.E.A.R. is the benchmark of storytelling but when you play F.E.A.R. & F.E.A.R. 2 Project Origin you will notice the huge drop in effort when it comes to story.I used to enjoy this game upon release but it's been well over 3 years since it came out and looking back retrospecitvely the entire game is awful. The horror is gone, Alma is no longer frightening, there is no depth and I really miss the JupiterFX engine that was in the previous 2 titles. I'm a ridiculously huge fan of F.E.A.R., to the point where I was an official moderator on the F.3.A.R. forums, received a free copy of the game, T-shirts, heck even a signed poster by the dev team. And yet... why is the game so bad? They just threw it out the window. And it's a real shame. I doubt we will ever get a F.E.A.R. 4 and the series ends on a flat note. Ridiculous. F.E.A.R. 3 is subpar. It stands nowhere near the previous iterations of the series by Monolith and you cannot help but wonder what went wrong. The characters of the story are not done any justice and the storyline is a shoddy mess. It's a horrible way to end the series and F.E.A.R. ended with a whimper, rather than a slo-mo explosion. TL;DR - Monolith shouldn't have given the game to Day 1 Studios to develop. Day 1 Studios screwed it up. Avoid game. Buy during 75%+ sale. Cry yourself to sleep knowing F.E.A.R. series ended badly.

												F.E.A.R. 3 is an unusual yet fun installment of the F.E.A.R. series. It is focused on the online aspect so the story of the game is told in a very fragmented and overall poor way, however this doesn't stop the levels from being fun. It reminds me of Modern Warfare 2 more than it does of the previous F.E.A.R. games. Thus, if you hate Modern Warfare you may want to wait until the game is cheaper.F.E.A.R. 3 is longer than other First Person Shooters of this generation. The game has eight levels with four modes of difficulty, with two characters to select from and a scoring system similar to Call of Duty's multiplayer challenges. All of this means that there is a lot of replay value to be had from this game. "

												FEAR 3 is an enjoyable shooter that is more of an action game than a horror survival game. The graphics are decent when maxed out and slow motion makes the often frenetic shootouts very fun and rewarding. The story is ridiculously laughable, and while I played the two other FEAR games quite a long time ago, I don't quite remember them being as silly. The cutscenes do have their entertaining moments though. Overall, the game executes all the core fundamentals that make a first person shooter enjoyable and entertaining. While not groundbreaking or innovative, FEAR 3 is fun to play and has its challenging moments.			"

												I really enjoy this game. I think its a lot of fun. So many people complain becuase this game isnt FEAR 1. Well I do agree that the first FEAR game is the best overall, I still think that F3 is better in a lot of way and has way more action. No its not as scary and it seems to me there arn't as many weapons either but the gun play is really top notch. I won't go through all the pros and cons but overall this game is great and worth the money. People need to keep in mind, if they want to play F1 they should go play it. Every COD installment is exactly the same for the most part with small changes to keep it fresh but that boring. I like how every Fear game has its own feel and in my opinion they did this game right. The coop is really good and if you want more of a challenge and if you want the game to be more creepy then solo it.			"

												Very fun and decently violent game. The game was interesting but if you're looking for the old scare factor that the FEAR series offers, then you're looking at the wrong game. This more or less turned into a cooperative shooter with the occasional predictable jump scares of Alma. I will admit thought it was a really interesting game and I was actually really invested into the story of the brothers and mother. The game however is short as hell seeing that I completed it in five hours. I think I was supposed to get more hours out of this by replaying the story with the different character but don't see much of a point when I already finished it. But if you're in the market for a shooter with your buddy, then this game can't go wrong.			"

But, sadly, I do feel that Day 1 Studios could have put more into what was, at the least, a renowned franchise. Still, despite the lacking material, what is there is commendable. At the very least worth picking up once the price drops or if on sale, as the co-op campaign alone gives a decently solid offering.			"

Also, not sure why they didn't include local co-op when it's clearly a direct port from xbox including the clunky feel of the controls. Guess they just couldn't find enough corners to cut.This time you get to play both brothers (though you have to complete it with point man, the guy you play in the first game, before playign as Fettel). Fettel is by way the most enjoyable. Stealing other peoples bodies from across the room for surprise attacks was great fun and kind of wish I could find a better game with something like this. Shooting people is quite satifying as well. Unfortunately that's pretty much it for good stuff.On the bad, I don't want to give the plot away, but in short, there is no fear in this game (if you know even the basics of the original storyline, you'll know what I mean pretty quickly), so it comes down to just killing people, the reasons for which are totally explained (aren't they actually on your side?! Aren't they trying to do what you want to do?!!). If fact, the whole storyling makes no sense. When you play as Fettel (a dead guy floating around as a spirit) you can get shot at, which also makes no sense, at all, even less in the context of the game. I have to also mention there is this dead space rip off bit which is just annoying and the games end kind of blew my mind, for mostly the wrong reasons. You do get to drive some mechs, which is kinda cool, until you play as fettel, then it is just plain annoying. It's also pretty short, I'd say the shortest of the F.E.A.R. games, but I could be wrong. I could whinge more but I'll stop there.If you've never played a F.E.A.R. game, well, you could find more enjoyment in this than I did.			"

												The fact this game is marketed as F.E.A.R is the real problem. I bought this game a while back and just now got around to playing it. As FEAR game, its easy earns 1/10. The reason being is well covered by so many other reviews. But to break it down to the just a FPS, its ok. I paid under $5 dollars for the game, and based on that the FPS game play is 6/10. I would say worth the $5, anymore and no way.			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 is a game with a serious identity crisis. Developed by Day 1 Studios instead Monolith (although they were apparently creatively involved), this is a seriously weak conclusion to a promising trilogy, with much of the signature creepiness and atmosphere plucked out in favour of imitating modern day shooters. Does it want to be a horror game, or does it want to be your standard points-based shooter with generic enemies?I recently played through F.E.A.R. 2 for the first time and enjoyed it, feeling that its shooting mechanics were great fun. It just felt smooth and easy to play through, with a couple of unsettling moments along the way that helped to make up for its less-than-stellar story. I guess I've always had an issue with the way this series tells its story, never quite fleshing out Alma Wade as a truly menacing presence, and being too cryptic about how the whole thing comes together. This wasn't really a major problem with the first two games though, as the frantic shooting and solid slo-mo mechanics more than made up for it. Perhaps the biggest issue with F.E.A.R. 3 is that most of the horror elements have been sucked out in favour of copying Call of Duty. This is a co-op shooter now, with a points system based on certain actions within the game. Co-op in horror games almost always dilutes the impact of the experience, and while I didn't get to try out the game with another person, I can't help but feel that these elements have affected what's here. Many of the scenarios within involve simply moving from one area to another, clearing out a bunch of soldiers along the way and maybe a few monsters later on. It isn't that there aren't some creepy moments (one early sequence wading through a warehouse with a bunch of flickering TV's is actually pretty effective) but they're thrown into a generic shell. The shooting is quite well done, with decent guns, and the tried-and-tested slo-mo effect helping you to take out enemies effectively, but it's just all very... ""meh"".By the end of F.E.A.R. 3 I felt like I'd sort of slogged my way through it just to see how the story concludes. I never felt truly invested due to how different the game feels from its predecessors, and the attempt to copy COD and modern shooters has drained much of the personality that previously existed. This is just a generic shooter now; a slightly painful limp to the conclusion of a story that was never brilliantly told from the beginning. You'll be playing this purely to finish out the trilogy, not because it's a good game. It doesn't stand out, it's not unique and it'll make you appreciate Monolith's two strong efforts all the more.			"

												After noticing that their price during the sale was FIVE DOLLARS, I actually had to delete my previous review because after playing F.E.A.R. some more and watching clips of it and Project Origin in another person's review, I felt I'd not explained ENOUGH just how much of a trainwreck this game is. The F.E.A.R. feeling is entirely gone. The gameplay is derivative and uninteresting unless you play as Paxton and they should have set it up like that in the first place instead of making you have to unlock him. Game looks, feels like dogshit compared to its predecessors.There, there's the whole game review. But that's actually less of the point. This game is like a cruel joke to those who liked the series. It has nothing to do with it gameplay wise. It's possibly the WORST ending to a trilogy in video game history. There's so much lore and story details that could make a person want to like it, but it honestly seems like the developer (not Monolith) was having a laugh at fans of the series. It literally feels like this was made in spite, and it's baffling considering Day 1 has made good games. They should have never made this game. They should have just made another Mechassault. For a moment, WB Games became the dumbest publisher ever. They reduced two silent, strong, badass protagonists to two uninteresting character, one of which has an extremely dull personality when he wasn't supposed to have one at all and one of which is a little ♥♥♥♥♥, making it seem like all of your actions were utterly in vain. Do not buy this game, even if it's really cheap, if you're a fan of the F.E.A.R. games and want to see how it ends. The only people this would probably appeal to are those who have never played any of the games in the series.Picture a clown laughing at you for ~5 hours before you whack your nutsack with a pool cue. Then, sticking your head up against the wall and don't STOP. DON'T. For another hour.That's F.E.A.R. 3.			"

												When i first played this mess of a game, i actually gave it a decent review. Hindsight is 20/20 i guess.  In reality, this game is HORRIBLE. God, where do i begin?  Graphics are ridiculously dated. Now i understand it's an older game, but that's not what i mean. The graphics in F.E.A.R. 2 are MUCH better. Gameplay is a joke, AI intelligence isn't and the story is stupid. oh, and the awards/achievements break immersion bigtime. The only redeeming feature is coop. so the majority of my score is for the coop. Avoid this stinker at all costs. If you are a F.E.A.R freak such as myself, only get it for completist purposes and then get it on huge discount on a Steam sale if you can. It's not worth much more than that. A sad and pitiful ending to a spectacular franchise. Final rating 2/10			"

												After the disappointment that was F.E.A.R. 2, Monolith decided to hand over the torch of mediocrity to Day 1 Studios, who in turn, dropped it into the ocean of incompetency, and drowned trying to retrieve it. The shooting components are noticeably weaker, nice to see the highlight of the series rammed even further into the ground. Mech sections make a return, because they worked so well in the second game, now a lot longer and more painful to plod through. The narrative is one of the worst I have seen, it started with an interesting premise in the first game and now has mutated into a despicable mess, devoid of any redeeming qualities. Giving the Point Man a voice and developing his character would have been a wise choice, engaging in dialogue with Fettel and expressing his thoughts and feelings about the chaos erupting around him. Instead we have Fettel trying his hardest to be unsettling and failing dismally, while Point Man gives him this hilarious look of contempt, which never leaves his face. I'm absolutely disgusted with how it ended, I didn't expect much but it really is abhorrent. As far as horror is concerned, Day 1 thinks that displaying butchered corpses and splattered blood in every corner is an effective way to drum up the scares, newsflash, it's not.A miserable way to end a trilogy.4/10			"

												A well made game in all rights and I will say that this is an ACTION game before it is a horror game unlike its predecessors.Multiplayer is good and feels well made but again it is DEADThe games story mode is done well yet short with only a few hours of gameplay to run through yet the leveling and point system creates competition during co-op gameplay which two players control two polar opposite characters. Player one takes on the role of Point Man which is pretty much that, he is the point man who goes in head on and guns down enemies with an arsenal of firepower and slow-mo gunplay. Player two plays as Fettel the main antagonist from F.E.A.R.: First Encounter Assault Recon who plays more as a support class with possessing enemy soldiers and using them for a limited time to use their weapons and back point man up.On the topic of the story is that there are two endings one is for Point Man (good ending) and the second is for Paxton Fettel (bad ending) and depending on which player has the highest score at the end of the game gets their ending but the solo campaign is solely Point Man's ending7/10 points needs a bit more horror to feel fearful of Gameplay 8/10Story 6/10Controls 8.5/10Multiplayer (If you can find a game) 7/10			"

												F.3.A.R. continues the story of the second game and plays the character of the first game (you can use a second character after you finish each interval) The game is a decent port to the PC, could use a little more optimization but it's not bad, I got a Steam redeemable key for $4.99 and it's worth it for the SP alone. MP seems dead though as I couldn't find many coop matches. The game seems harder compared to its precedessors and the AI is smarter and not dumbed down. Good game overall, finished the campaign in about 5 hours. Many questions are answered and many new ones arise, wonder if F.E.4.R. is in the works.			"

												If you're expecting a FEAR game, skip this, the magic is gone. The first FEAR game was a suspense game with shooting, this is a shooting game with some suspense scenes. There is a multiplayer survival game that feels like COD's Zombie mode. Fettle is actually pretty fun to play as but enemies are too aware to allow for full use of his powers. Otherwise it's a decent Wally McChestHigh. Check this out If you like cover based FPS with regenerating health and a slow-mo mechanic, and don't mind that it plays like a console port with weird mouse acceleration.			"

												The campaign is decent, and if you get a friend along you'll have good fun(and some jumpscares too).The horror part has lost a bit versus more action and more shooting, but it's still there.The multiplayer part was a great adition tough, and even if it was underestimated it is one of the greatest aspects of the game.- ""F**king Run"" is an adrenalinic mode where you run away from almas wall of death all while fighting hordes of enemies.And believe me there is nothing more anxious than reviving a downed friend while seeing the wall of death aproach.The mode title couldn't been more hit on!- Contractions a round-based survival mode, where players must barricade and stock up weapons against a total of 20 waves of enemies.When the round ends stocks appear around the map that gives ammo and new weapons, all while trying to rebuild your shelters protection.The last few round are really hard so good team play is critical!So to sum it up, if you are looking for a really scary horror game, you should probably get any of the other good games around.If you are looking for a great action game to play with a friend, or some really fun and genuinely entertaining multiplayer modes, then this is most certainly for you!

												Well, it is not the Fear as it was before, but it actually is not that bad. The most refreshing element for me was the possibility to play as Fettel, it is fun to posses the enemies and rush it forward to collect souls or die, because you can actually die twice in this case - first possesed body, then Fettel. It is really fierce gameplay. As Pointman it is a bit generic,but...there are much worse FPShooters out there, so don't worry. Plus I liked the leveling up, which brings some more challange into it - like trying to get 50 headshots in a level, 20 kills without being hurt, etc. Yes, levels are simple and not very nice, enemies stupid (especially hellhounds and the freaks), but shooting them makes you feel good and that is what matters in any FPS.

												This is a wonderful game that really adds to the Fear series. The graphics look awesome and very well done. The multiplayer is totally awesome but can sometimes be hard to find people to play with. It is a game that can be play with a friend on singleplayer co-op. It is so much fun to play through the entire campaign with a friend. The sounds at times are really creepy and can give you the chills when you dont know were the enemy is and all you hear is the footsteps. The combat is what makes this game really shine, its really well done. The story can be confusing at times, so its a game that needs to be beaten a couple of times to really understand what is going on. I would suggest playing the previous Fear's to really understand this story better. This isn't as scary as  the previous 2 in the in the Fear series but it really does bring something unique.  I've loved playing this game and its a great one to pick up, I've enjoyed this greatly awesome game and I know you will too!			"

												Altough I recommend, be warned. This almost feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cousin of Farcry, the Farcry that was hidden under the sofa from the neighbours. I would only suggest this for big fans of the series.Graphics:- Good, rich environments and very varying techniques. I thoroughly enjoyed the visual quality of this game. But it clearly looks like a console game. The performance is good, but I did have to drop my Antisotropic Filtering slightly which baffles me?Sounds:- Good, realistic and believable but suffers from the same problem as Fear 2 in that the music is cued and sometimes kicks off in strange intervals during a fire-fight.Gameplay:- This game is not scary. It is deviod of scares and just doesn't have the same element of fright as 1 & 2.- The environments are varied, and are done justice. Altough I do not like the fact that the game starts in Brazil, it was believeable.- Not all of the guns are useful, I hated the Combat Shotgun and only used the pistol when I was forced to. SOme weapons were absolutely useless.- The AI sucks, it seems to have gotten worse as the series has progressed.- The game is riddled with FMVs. FMVs? Is this the 90s? Is this Final Fantasy? I don't want FMVs in my action-shooters, I want action.Story:- Load of crap. It feels like multiple people had their opinions and ideas added and removed as the story progressed and the full view was just hard to follow and uninteresting.- I do like that they included The Point Man, Paxton Fettel & Becket, but the weaving of the characters together is so forced it feels like it's being helf together by super-glue and band-aids.- The protagonist (The Point Man) is so unlikeable it's ridiculous. He looks like a serial-killer and acts like someone who would NEVER have been accepted into the F.E.A.R. operatives in the first place.- The game starts in Brazil. Brazil? of all places, why Brazil? It's so far removed and misplaced. Guantanamo Bay, I could still believe, but a random slum in Brazil? WTF?			"

												Fear 3 doesn’t do anything particularly wrong, but it does nothing good either, everything is mediocre. I think its biggest mistake was going for the call of duty crowd, instead of going for the horror element and only having the resident evil franchise to contend with, and a few others in that niche, but it steps into the first person shooter arena, which is already saturated and loses its identity, and shows up massive, underperformance compared to the goliaths in that arena.  Should of stayed true to its self, maybe next time, find out what its good at and stick to it. "

												is this really a F.E.A.R Game?!?  Fear 2 while a step back from 1st F.E.A.R, it at least  felt like a F.E.A.R game and was for most part fun. this game is like any generic shooter. 2 weapon limit system(f*cking whyyyy), Regerating Health(Done to F*king death, god forbid we have tension in a ""horror"" game), A.I. have little strategy and mostly follow basic actions of cover, peek, shoot(farcry from Fear 1 A.I.).  story is also complete garbage with the characters being completely bland(who decided NOW to give The Pointman [who has always been a silent protagonist] some character). its not a terrible game but is so average. you'll waste your time to find anything that is remotely exceptional. do yourself a favor and skip this entirely, go back to playing Fear 1 and 2.

												Most say that F.E.A.R.3 sucks compared to the other F.E.A.R.'s. I disagree.  I believe F.E.A.R. 3 is a great game, it has a great storyline, great gameplay and if you pair up with a friend this game can easily provide hours of fun. I own this game on XB360 and PS3, I'm now working on 100%ing it on Steam. F.E.A.R. 3 was the first in the serious I played, and there were plenty of times I felt my heart race. It's more action centered than the others, but still able to give a few scares to an unsuspecting player. If you've played the other two games, the controls are a bit awkward to re-learn but everything has a great feel to it. The only downside to this game is unlike the first two, you only get two guns and they sadly aren't carried over after the chapter. Which for someone who loves snipers like I do, it sucks only being able to use them at some points. I highly recommend giving this game, this series a chance.			"

												Firstly, I have played all the F.E.A.R. games and can say they are amazing.  The immersion is incredible once you are sucked into the story it has you.  The scare factor is way up there and jump scares are out of control scary as hell.  I played the first two in Iraq and was terrified with my headphones on while others slept.  It has a very well executed ambiance that makes you look around the room more than play sometimes.  I would have to take smoke breaks just for my sanity.  I have played all the silent hill games to completion and this games ranks with those titles in my opinion.  If you are going to get a fear game then start from the beginning because the story carries throughout and gets weirder and weirder as you progress.  The movement and shooting along with A.I is on point and very difficult at times but the payoff is worth it.  If you are a whiny baby then play with a friend to make yourself feel like an adult I guess?			"

												Great sequel to the thrilling F.E.A.R 2. This time Alma`s son´s unite to reach their pregnant mother. But they are not only one`s. Also Armachan seek`s Alma for their own sinister purpose.  While story is short and lacks in horror, games campaign offers great story and awesome gameplay. Riot shields, Mech`s, natural and unantural enemies, theyre all here. I enjoyed this game in ps3 and enjoy it even more in pc. Pointman`s lighting like reflexes and Fettel`s possession abilities make this game a blast. And this time there is no need to go in solo, co-op is included. Invite your friend to join you in intense MP or reach Alma together in campaign. But wich one is going to be the Alma`s favorite son? Do you share and help or are you rivals to the end? Beautiful game.			"

												you know, this game suffers from a lot of ""being ♥♥♥♥♥♥"" The gameplay feels six years old, the scares and a lot of the mechanics remind me of Half life and Unreal, and every other first person shooter ever. That being said Half life and Unreal are ♥♥♥♥ing sick. THAT being said Fear 3 doesn't innovate at all, but it's really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fun. This game constantly throws objectives and challenges at you, and insane difficulty is actually difficult. you're constantly entertained and you're trying to complete every level with as many points and as quickly as possible. I would highly recommend this game if you're looking for some mindless fast paced fun, cause it suceeds so well. Is it scary? no. does it bring much new to the table? ♥♥♥♥ no. Pay like 5 bucks for this if you can though, it's worth at least a try.			"

												I bought this game on HumbleBundle for around five bucks and I even finished the game. Here's my final verdict, splitted into Pros and Cons :)Pros:- The graphics are pretty good- Cutscenes are very decent- In-game cutscenes are seamless- Animations are smoothly, like the enemies' movements- The game runs extremely smoothly, no framedrops etc- The blood and gore is decent and there (but there could be more)- Fights can be pretty intense. Hard, but fun!- The weapons have a great impact and it's very satisfying to decapitate a enemy with a sniper rifle.- There is no direct safe / load option, but there is a checkpoint system. Normally I absolutey dislike a pure checkpoint system, but here it's done very well! Thumbs up.- Some levels were plain awesome. Like the one in the store with all those TVs. Awesome! I also liked it that there were same parts of levels where I was able to mount a Mech. Nice.- Auto-regnerating health. While many players hate this, I welcome this. Because I'm a bad player with no skills, so thanks for that.Things I don't judge:- Levels are very linear. I don't mind linear gameplay as long as the action keeps going.Cons:- Very few (but great!) weapons- No akimbo mode for pistols (but for Uzis, somehow)- The ranking system. Do I really need this?- The story. I didn't followed the story of any FEAR game. Same here, never was interested in.- Enemies are invulnerable while animated (while they are jumping over a crate for example)- The boss battle in interval 8 ist plain boring.- Even for me as a bad gamer, the game seems kinda short.- What the hell can I do with Fettel after I unlocked him for a mission? I never found out, to be honest.- Same with those zombies. They're still standing after three close range blasts of a shotgun. What the hell? And those knive throwing idiots in the beginning of the game, I felt like I'm in BIOSHOCK.- I got REALLY tired of those moments where you automatically start to walk slow, your slomo-option is disabled and you know that something will appear. Bored the hell out of me.- The later levels, screaming Alma and always that babbling Fettel. I know, it's probably part of the story but it annoyed the hell out of me.In conclusion, FEAR3 is a good ego shooter which will serve a few hours of fun. Don't expect much, because you won't get much.			"

												Despite a too-short campaign and repetitive levels, FEAR 3 is still a good finale to one of the most unique first-person shooter franchises I've ever played. The weapons are fun, blowing bad guys away in slow-mo remains satisfying, the scares are lethal and the graphics are still quite impressive, with a lot of really beautiful lighting effects. When it comes to the FEAR series, one thing that I've always loved about them is how the genius of each instalment lies in the mixing of cinematic elements of Asian horror with 80s action films. Perhaps the series as a whole could be best described as The Ring meets Die Hard. However, this wouldn't do it justice, these games are well worth playing, both for the casual gamer and the survival horror aficionado. Hopefully someday we can see a fourth one!			"

												There was no fear to be had in a game called 'Fear'. But then again, it has a lot of dots between letters (not sure how many exactly, hey, not everyone is into quantum mathematics or geometrical algebroids, ya know), and it also got a number (I think it's a sequel to the second one, which was a sequel to the first one, and the first one had a prequel about Uncle Fred and his good friend - a talking German banana named ""Leutenant Mattias Von Gruber""), so it has A LOT going for it. Just like my doctor always says: ""if you cannot handle something, just calm down and try not to choke on your vomit'. Which is a perfect analogy for this game and our life in general. 10/10.			"

												FEAR is considered the last ""classic"" shooter, coming out shortly after Half Life 2.  A unique game in that it takes a survival horror atmosphere but doesn't pretend to be a survival horror game. It's balls to the wall in your face up your♥♥♥♥♥licks your boobies action in slow motion firing an automatic flak cannon at supersoldiers with tourettes in the middle of an office complex. Naturally once people realized that the game was not an independent shooter and was actually published by a big name corporation they pretended that they didn't like it as much as they really did.When the sequel came out it recieved pretty much nothing but praise because all of the nerds that want to look cool and pretend they don't like something popular couldn't deny the fact that they all fired off a couple broken arrows to the thought of Alma slamming them against the wall and taking their virginity with her haunted hot pocket.As for the third game, it recieved a relatively ""eh"" reception. At this point I would have to agree, but only if you take the story into account. I prefer to ignore the story completely. I didn't like it that much in the first game and was disappointed that the sequel didn't just resolve everything so we could stop dwelling on Pointman's mommy issues and start fighting other weird stuff. I mean, the government didn't create a SWAT version of the X-Files for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles.In an attempt to make the story more grimdark everything became extremely convoluted and ""edgy"" with every other character suddenly being revealed to be worse than hitler every 15 minutes because they realized they needed to end the story with all the plot threads resolved. In order to resolve these plot threads they dropped like 20 nukes and then said ""♥♥♥♥ it"" and made it so that when Alma had contractions that would cause the planet to♥♥♥♥♥♥itself for some reason.Like I said, I don't care about the story, the action is what it's all about. The gun butt is replaced with a combat knife but you can still kick guys in the balls and kill them instantly. Weapons can be fired form the hip with limited effectiveness, slightly more accurately than the first and second game.It's really not that bad. It's not amazing, but it's pretty good. It's like Friday the 13th part IV. They're just phoning it in but that's cool because a lot of people die.			"

It may feel like you're fighting hoardes of combine non-stop, but after a few waves you will understand that you are NOT playing another HL2 clone, you're playing an entirely fresh and original haunted FPS thriller.The fully interactive scenery is gorgeous, with many nooks and crannys to explore much like the original heart of all FPS monster shooters, Duke Nukem 3D. The gun variety is impressive with pistols, smgs, shotguns....The stages may look a little familiar from other games, and the ai is a bit dated, but dont let that deter you from this exciting and innovative FPS!

In single player this really changes the games ""Boss Fights"" since you cannot just blow them away with a weapon but have to juggle body jumping along with combat.

The loss of all weapons at the end of most chapters is really annoying especially when there isnt an obvious story reason. 3.

												I went into this game with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. I was told that there was no horror in this one, that's not true. The atmosphere and sound engineering are top notch in this game. The three things that divided fans most were that Alma takes a back seat role, the horror is minimized and the levels are too straightforward. Let's address those one by one. First, I personally like that Alma took a back seat role. After a Fear 1 and Fear 2 marathon I was getting really tired of seeing a naked girl or a little kid in a red dress run across my screen. It's nice to see the other creatures take over more. Second, the horror is minimized. No, it's not, not at all. There's just as much as Fear 2. And that's from someone who played all 3 over a weekend. Rather than use the same boring jump scares (although they're still there) this game aims more for atmosphere and sound tension. The dread of something jumping out actually makes the game pretty tense. Third, the levels are too straight-forward. I 100% agree. There is almost no collecting, it's all done by achievements this time around. Rather than finding a needle to get more slo-mo, you just kill X amount of enemies with X or something. And even then there is no curiosity about it, just go down the tunnel and kill everything. Another complaint is the “COD-ification” of Fear. Again, I agree, in this game you can only carry two weapons off the bat and barely any ammo. This also works in the games' favor as the action mechanics in this game are far and away the best. Gunplay is tight, and solid. Seriously, the shooting in this game is easily the best in the series. All the weapons are absolutely lethal and splatter enemies. Sadly, the health regen (which I personally hate) from COD is in this game as well. Also, because there is health regen, there are some seriously cheap deaths.+Best shooting mechanics in the seriesFluid gameplay (smooth FPS throughout)Great atmosphereAll the guns are useful againTwo playable characters give the levels some replayability (You can play as either Paxton Fettel or Point Man)-The scares themselves are a bit minimizedNo collection, just overused achievementsLazy level layoutNo medkitsOverall 8/10, it's not perfect, but I really enjoyed it			"

												Not bad but rather mediocre compared to the original FEAR.  PROS - playable and the AI is ok. If you havent played any of the games previously then the game might even scare you at points. CONS - 1. Very linear maps 2. The loss of all weapons at the end of most chapters is really annoying especially when there isnt an obvious story reason. 3. Limited enemy character skins so at times when you are being attacked by a hord it just looks like a really lazy 'clone' job - lazy production/programming. 4. The use of the mechs is poorly thought out with little challenge or difficulty despite being on hardest setting.			"

												I just finished this game after having it in my backlog for quite a long time and honestly part of me wished I didn't play this game at all because of how much I love F.E.A.R and F.E.A.R. 2. Don't play this if you loved the previous F.E.A.R. games, which sucks to say, but this is not the experience you'd want for a sequel.Performance/graphics:Performance is ok in the sense that I was able to play at 120fps most of the time, but did have dips on occasion, There aren't as many graphics options compared to the first two games, but there are still some. What really bothered me was the forced Motion Blur the game had and the only way to turn it off is via an options.cfg in the game's local folders. Not too big of an inconvenience, but definitely something they should have added in the game's options menus especially when it was toggable  in the previous two games. Graphics themselves are ok, still good looking, but honestly F.E.A.R. 2 looks way better, at leas to me.Combat:F.E.A.R. 3's combat is 100% different compared to the first two. Obviously they're all FPS games, but the actual weapon combat(aiming, weapon firing/response, etc.) is completely different and I don't think it was for the better. You're limited to only two weapons at a time, no medkits/armor pickups(regenerative health), but there is still slow-mo and vehicles in the game. Also there are still around the same amount of weapon variation in the game compared to the first two, but you're just limited to only two at a time which I think is a huge negative, but might be because of the co-op mode the game has, so to balance it out.Atmosphere:Still ""scary"", but compared to the first two games F.E.A.R. 3 is more action than horror and that's bad. I'm not sure if it was because of the co-op addition so they couldn't account for player positioning for jumpscares or scene build ups correctly, but the games are suppose to be scary, but this game probably only scared me once out of the four hours I played it.Story:I appreciate the closure the game has given me for wanting more after completely F.E.A.R. 2, but I wish I didn't experience this closure exactly. The game has two endings, one considered ""Good"" and one ""Bad"", but I'd say both are pretty bad. I won't post spoilers, but if you love F.E.A.R and F.E.A.R. 2, don't play this.Price:This game is not worth $19.99, not even close to that. I got it for $4.99 a while back and that's honestly all I would feel comfortable paying.			"

												Altough I recommend, be warned. This almost feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cousin of Farcry, the Farcry that was hidden under the sofa from the neighbours. I would only suggest this for big fans of the series.Graphics:- Good, rich environments and very varying techniques. I thoroughly enjoyed the visual quality of this game. But it clearly looks like a console game. The performance is good, but I did have to drop my Antisotropic Filtering slightly which baffles me?Sounds:- Good, realistic and believable but suffers from the same problem as Fear 2 in that the music is cued and sometimes kicks off in strange intervals during a fire-fight.Gameplay:- This game is not scary. It is deviod of scares and just doesn't have the same element of fright as 1 & 2.- The environments are varied, and are done justice. Altough I do not like the fact that the game starts in Brazil, it was believeable.- Not all of the guns are useful, I hated the Combat Shotgun and only used the pistol when I was forced to. SOme weapons were absolutely useless.- The AI sucks, it seems to have gotten worse as the series has progressed.- The game is riddled with FMVs. FMVs? Is this the 90s? Is this Final Fantasy? I don't want FMVs in my action-shooters, I want action.Story:- Load of crap. It feels like multiple people had their opinions and ideas added and removed as the story progressed and the full view was just hard to follow and uninteresting.- I do like that they included The Point Man, Paxton Fettel & Becket, but the weaving of the characters together is so forced it feels like it's being helf together by super-glue and band-aids.- The protagonist (The Point Man) is so unlikeable it's ridiculous. He looks like a serial-killer and acts like someone who would NEVER have been accepted into the F.E.A.R. operatives in the first place.- The game starts in Brazil. Brazil? of all places, why Brazil? It's so far removed and misplaced. Guantanamo Bay, I could still believe, but a random slum in Brazil? WTF?			"

												If any dev want's to know how best to put a bullet in a series. Play this. It's like Dead Space 3. Looks like it's predecessors, but it's completely misses to the point of its own existence. This is meant to be a horror game. But instead it's just another generic shooter with terrible controlls.

												Another repetitive and boring shooter.  From what I have heard, this is a completely different game from the first two games.  So if you like call of duty with jumpscares then you will love it, but believe me that is not a good mix. Also this is a game that you want to play with a friend, because this gets really boring.

												After the disappointment that was F.E.A.R. 2, Monolith decided to hand over the torch of mediocrity to Day 1 Studios, who in turn, dropped it into the ocean of incompetency, and drowned trying to retrieve it. The shooting components are noticeably weaker, nice to see the highlight of the series rammed even further into the ground. Mech sections make a return, because they worked so well in the second game, now a lot longer and more painful to plod through. The narrative is one of the worst I have seen, it started with an interesting premise in the first game and now has mutated into a despicable mess, devoid of any redeeming qualities. Giving the Point Man a voice and developing his character would have been a wise choice, engaging in dialogue with Fettel and expressing his thoughts and feelings about the chaos erupting around him. Instead we have Fettel trying his hardest to be unsettling and failing dismally, while Point Man gives him this hilarious look of contempt, which never leaves his face. I'm absolutely disgusted with how it ended, I didn't expect much but it really is abhorrent. As far as horror is concerned, Day 1 thinks that displaying butchered corpses and splattered blood in every corner is an effective way to drum up the scares, newsflash, it's not.A miserable way to end a trilogy.4/10			"

												I only recommend this as a part of the trilogy, on it's own, it's weak. Graphically, they could have put more into it. The story begins annoyingly different to the rest of the series, but by half way through I was much more into it. The ending is quite good and worth hacking out the rest of the game for. I'd say 6/10 but only as an ending to an epic trilogy.			"
