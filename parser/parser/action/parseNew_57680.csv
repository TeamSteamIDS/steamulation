												First the game asks me to create a Kalypso Account, then i go to play online and it asks me to create yet an other username and password. After creating those two separate accounts, do I then learn that I need to link the second one to my Facebook to be able to play with friends. The game it self seems lacking after playing abit solo. And being obligated to link to a Facebook account to play multiplayer is just absurd! Even more so since I do not have a Facebook. Bought this on special for 1.09$ and honestly I don't sugest this to anyone even at 1$ ist'a waste of money.			"

As far as I'm aware, It should have a yellow box up right corner that notifies the customer if it's needful  to play (3rd party account or 3rd party EULA).

												Rather surprising amount of depth in this game. While I probably wouldn't buy this at full price, getting it on sale or in a bundle is a sure thing.The graphics are pleasant - not perfect but for the most part I was happy looking around at what the game had to offer. It played a lot like a non-complex Witcher (2). Gameplay was responsive with button combos to swing your sword this way or that or kick or whatever, and there are RPG elements to unlock more combos/abilities/perks. Honestly I was expecting poor gameplay and that was a surprise for me.The story is better than many of the reviews are stating, but it's not told in a very effective way. Cheesy lines delivered by soft-spoken NPCs in which you see little. But it's there. It's not Shakespeare in that it's easy to miss if your ears aren't open, but it's a bit harder to pick up is all.Regardless, story is not needed. It's meant to be played not read or watched (in that if it were a movie or a novel it would suck).The individual cells or environments are unique enough and I rather enjoyed snapping between two characters or having the option to play co-op (not that I have any friends). Many people say there are too many co-op games, but I feel a lot of games just ignore co-op even if it would fit perfectly. At least give those of us who like co-op the option, and those who don't like it lose nothing in the process.All in all a good experience. A poor man's Witcher 2.			"

												Surprisingly addicting game.  Too bad it's overlooked.The graphics are dated, really dated, and you can tell that right away. But somehow, the game itself does not appear to be ugly - the game doesn't try to be anything else but a good and easy linear adventure. But in general, the graphics are STATIC. As in, there's no wind, trees are frozen in time and space, no physics, no discernible effects on the environment by your actions.The story is extremely easy to follow though. No need to memorize names, locations and tons of redundant quests. And there's an abundant amount of history to enjoy. I'm not sure how much of it is concrete though.There is a certain degree of suspense in some levels and sequences and there is the ability to do some stealth killing.You can play as one of the two Templar brothers, and you can switch in between the two any time you want, eventually, another character joins in.You can also gain experience and exchange it for some combo moves, more health, etc.You also get to collect some items that enable you to get one or another armor and weaponry.Let's not forget about the co-op though. The bad thing is that I'm not sure how much re-playability this game has. So I would rather see this game as a lone experience and have other games that scream co-op to have co-op (Jericho for instance). Your AI co-op partner is okaish for the most part, and your stealth moves are apt to copying your moves, but sometimes your partner with end up on the ground which is when you have to revive him or her.Also, it's rare in games when the two protagonists tend to agree with each other most if not all the time. The two characters you play as agree with each other constantly, unlike in Bulletstorm, Enslaved, etc. So even though there's enough scripted dialogue between the two characters, I would probably enjoy to listen to some arguments about the inquisition, the church, the main quest and what not.The game is also easy, really easy, but eventually, it does require you to pull off some combos and some well-times blocks and counter-attacks to advance further.The voice acting is pretty poor though.The game is pretty long. There are puzzles to solve and dungeons to crawl through.  There are plenty of twists and turns along the way.  The co-op is outstanding. My best friend and I spent 3 days playing the game. A few months later, we started playing the game from scratch. When we first tried running co-op we had difficulty seeing each other, so I e-mailed the dev at the end of 2012 to figure out what's up. They e-mailed back a few days later saying that they were out of the office because of X-mas (they also wished me happy X-Mas), and then asked that we stay put for a couple of days so that they could e-mail us back the activation e-mail (which you unfortunately need to play online), so they did so a few days later.In any case, I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to relax, who likes the hack'n'slash with tactical approach and anyone who wants enjoy a nice story.Plus, you get to support a small company that made the game in the first place.

												Kalypso takes your money AND force you indirect to be on Facebook!To play this game online with a friend, you need a Facebook-profile to do so … in other words, if you don’t have a Facebook-profile, you are forced to open at Facebook-account in order to have fun coop-game with a friend. So if you don’t have an account on Facebook, maybe because you don’t like the idea of having a facebook-profile, then DO NOT buy this game  – otherwise you have spend money on nothing!I do wonder why Kalypso have their games on Steam, when Kalypso don’t allow their games to run on Steams servers. I like to have ONE account – ONE server to play my games by. I find it ridiculous to need several of servers to play my different games – and that is why I have a Steam-account – to play my online-games at ONE place! I wish that Steam wouldn’t sell games which can’t be played on Steams own servers, because I don’t want to open all kinds of account everywhere. I want ONE account, ONE server from where I can play my games. I hope that other whom read this will back me up and complain about this ridiculous policy to force us gamers to need many different servers and accounts (and now Facebook) to be able to play expensive purchased games bought on Steam.

												In my opinion one of the most underrated games ever. It is a very solid ARPG in a setting without elves and orcs !!!Graphics are not really good , but never ugly and very atmospheric. Sound and music is very good and voices are great.You will play with three different chars which can be changed during missions, which can be a lot fun .The story is really good, especially if you like stories about Crusader, Stonemasons and the holy grail !! I really enjoyed the feeling to be on a “little crusade” The game design is straight forward as in most action based RPG. You have to do a mainquest and lots of bonus quests.Rewarded XP can be used to get new skills, upgrade skills, get more HP …..Controlling with a XBOX Controller is solid and works good, but the game never shows Controller Button, only Keyboard shortcuts..8 / 10  "

												It's a shame that The First Templar doesn't get much credit for it has a quite splendid plot and the fighting mechanisms of two playable characters are solid enough for player to try differnet tactics instead of tapping one mouse button at each strike. There is also some nice, light puzzle solving and sneaking features time to time. Unfortunately I haven't had chance to try co-op with this, but according to what people say it should be even more entertaining.So, is this game something groundbreaking? No.. but I have surely enjoyed playing it !!			"

												A nice 3rd person view hack and slash adventure game set during the time of Crusades. The game is story-driven and has the player take the role of Celian d'Arestide, and his two allies who accompany him, Marie and Roland, who are in the search of a Holy Grail to bring about peace and prosperity to the world.The story is generally fun to follow. A lot of interesting events occur, a lot of betrayal, and some plot twists as well. The ending only felt a bit anti-climatic and rushed. I think it could've been made better and expanded on a bit. Some of the side characters were also not developed enough and not given much screen time.Combat is fun. It's somewhat simplistic and doesn't offer all that many combinations for the player to use, but it manages to stay fun throughout the whole game regardless. Each of the 3 playable characters has their own unique moves to use in combat. Celian fights with a sword and shield, Roland with a single longsword, and Marie uses daggers, which she can throw as well. Enemies tend to come in some varieties too. Some might be armed with a shield which you have to destroy first before being able to hurt them, some are archers, pikemen, nimble assassins, war dogs, and even hideous beastmen.Each character has a skill tree, where they can spend skill points acquired during missions. Some upgrades unlock new moves, whilst others are passives, such as offer more health, or increase damage of certain combos. This creates some character progression and offers some depth to the gameplay.Most levels focus on combat, though there are some stealth sections as well, as well as levels where you have to solve switch puzzles and dodge traps. There are also some mini-games present here and there too, such as the Trebuchet mini-game where you get to operate a Trebuchet and shoot down some approaching enemy troops. In general, there's a good variety of things to do in the game.Visuals and music are both fine enough and do their job. Neither stands out too much, but they're not bad either. There are also unlockables to get which should satisfy completionist player types, such as new outfits for the characters and also some backstory audio logs.Generally a very fun hack and slash game with a relatively good story and characters. Highly recommended.			"

												The First Templar is a respectable co-op action game set during the First Crusade. The enjoyable combat and decent story help to overcome the game's pedestrian production values, and make it worth checking out.In The First Templar you and a partner (controlled either by another player or pretty good AI) are on a quest for the Holy Grail. While your goals are noble other characters may not be as trustworthy as they seem, and there are a few plot twists and surprise revelations along the way.Much of your time in The First Templar will be spent in combat and the fighting system is good; there's a nice rhythm to it, and a wide variety of moves can be unlocked, which keeps things from getting stale.When you're not fighting, you're figuring out puzzles, negotiating deadly traps, and searching for collectibles. There are even a few stealth sequences in The First Templar, and they're pulled off decently enough. Thankfully the AI of your partner is quite good, and they can easily negotiate the levels and handle themselves in combat without you having to babysit them.The Special Edition of The First Templar on Steam contains a bonus mission that takes place after the events of the main game. This mission takes about 90 minutes to complete, and it has a few new Steam achievements to go along with it. All told it will take about 12 - 14 hours to complete the game, depending on how thorough you are when it comes to looking for hidden areas and collectibles.The First Templar is underrated.			"

												A pretty much unknown game. Nobody has heard about this and i got mine from a bundle. Gave it a try and was not dissapointed. Graphics are old and characters blocky but that does not stop you from having a pretty decent time with this title. Greatest strengths this title has is the Templar story setting which isn't very unique but when it's well made it has all the components you need for a good cloak and dagger story. I found the story arc and level design to be quite decent. Combat is based on using combos and special moves. Silent takedowns can be used on enemies from behind. I suppose combat system could be described as a loose precursor to the popular batman games.  Only real cons i could find are the aging looks and stretched ending. It's like the makers of this game just did not want the ride to end when it would have been most appropriate. Gamepad recommended.			"

												The First Templar is an action RPG set in a medieval times, where you take on a role of a crusader wandering in search of Holy Grail. The beginning of the story might sound dull but overall plot is well written and quite enjoyable.The game mechanics is quite simple yet entertaining. The game is not that hard even on the highest difficulty setting. It is also quite long, there are over 20 levels total, each worth about 30 to 45 mins of gametime.It should be noted that the game features a co-op mode fully implemented into the story. All the achievements are also obtainable in this mode and the game is much more fun when playing it with a friend, though you might experience some network lag from time to time.The largest flaw of the game is its outdated graphics, it seems sub-par even for the time of its release. All in all this a great game for co-op, I definitely recommend it. Playing it solo might be much less enjoyable.			"

												For the sale price of $2.99 (85% off) it's worth it.  Don't expect AAA level gaming but you can definitely do worse at this price.  It reminds me of Assassin's Creed (without the scaling of buildings) but with its quirks.  The graphics are console quality think PS3 but cleaner because of Antialiasing.  Also, I normally like to use a keyboard and mouse but prefer using an XBOX 360 controller in this game which helped with my character's movement during combat scenes.  If you purchase the game, you'll quickly see why I prefer the controller to the keyboard and mouse.  Also, I think its cool that you can play with a friend in split-screen.  One person uses the Keyboard and Mouse and the other the XBOX 360 controller.  Apparently there is also an online mode but honestly I haven't tried it yet.			"

												The First Templar is a mediocre third person action RPG. You are guided through a linear story with optional ""side objectives"" which amount to  straying off path for a minute to fight a band of enemies, open a chest, or read a tablet.First let's note one thing. YOU DON'T NEED FACEBOOK TO PLAY WITH A FRIEND. EVERY REVIEW THAT SAYS SO IS LYING. I PLAYED WITH MY FRIEND WITHOUT FACEBOOK. IT IS AS SIMPLE AS JOINING ON YOUR FRIEND THROUGH YOUR FRIENDS LIST.+The game doesn't look to bad, but then again I'm not picky.+A decent amount of collectible costumes for each of your 3 playable characters.+The music is pretty good, but it wasn't anything to brag about.+The combat is good and you have plenty of combos/moves to keep you entertained for a while.+Skill development is extensive with 4 trees of development for each character.+Co-op makes the game a lot more fun to play.-The sounds in this game are mediocre, no real effort was put into any kind of immersion.-Character models are ridiculous. Main character's head isn't even attached to his body. Your female companion's neck becomes distorted when she turns to look at you in certain scenes. When they speak their mouths move like puppets.  -The animations are limited and lacking. Every character has the same boring running animation that you get to stare at throughout the entire game.-The story was uninteresting at best and constantly interrupted by annoying villagers asking for your help. Making 3 out of every 4 levels completely unrelated to the story and mere filler to the story.-The game is too long for how uninteresting it is. By the end you'll be begging for it to be over.-The game as a choice system which was UNFORTUNATELY only used at the very end of the game. It should have been used throughout the entire game to keep me interested, or at least used better in the end so that my ending and the ending I didn't choose isn't simply one line of dialogue different.-The voice acting is lifeless, emotionless, and halfway through the game I began to ignore it -The dialogue is pathetically written. The lines are either blande, forced jokes that suck, or forced lines that are supposed to be the character's ""catchphrase"" almost that just becomes annoying to hear when they repeat it 4 times per level. IE: ""It's a girl thing.""-The character development was horrible. I already forgot most of their names. What's Roland's past? What was my female companions past? How come by 4 hours into the game all I know about my main character is, ""There was an accident. I don't remember anything. I don't talk about it."" And why don't I learn anything else about him until 8 hours into the game? I'm able to predict character development long before it is ever done.I'll give this a 4/10 simply because it entertained me for at least half of its playtime. But for the last 4 hours I found myself playing it just so I could finish it. It's not worth your money. Though in a bundle like I did, it's ok for some co-op entertainment. Until you get bored of it halfway through like my friend and I did. Avoid it if you can.			"

												In the last few years the knights templar for gamers became synonymous with the Illuminati with their representation in the Assassins creed universe.....already going off track here. When I first saw the screenshots for the game back in 2011 like many i thought it is an AC rip-off or ""the poor mans AC"" as i heard some say and did not even bother much until last year when i got it during summer sales.The first templar takes place after the 3rd Crusade(1189–1192), its a 3rd person action-adventure game and features co-op.You can play as 3 main characters which are interchangeable.The game begins with Celian d'Arestide(the main character) and Roland de Saint-Omer starting their quest for the (you won't believe it) THE HOLY GRAIL !!!11 , cheesy as it sounds the story is actually very complex and has nice twists towards the end and you meet more characters during your journey .Now lets talk about the first thing you experience, the graphics, while the game is not a triple A it still looks good with beautiful colors and textures, and while the character models look ok, there is no motion capture and it feels sometimes stiff.The soundtrack is nothing special, but the voice acting is quite good.The gameplay is where the game shines, the game has an excellent combat mechanic,as you level up you can learn new moves or improvements of already learned moves , each character has its own unique style Celian - Sword and Shield, Roland TwoHander and the 3rd main character Marie d'Ibelin has a rogue style gameplay with her weapons being daggers, although it seems like an rpg feature its not, there are no skill trees and in the end you can have all skills and upgrades.You can upgrade your equipment, but this is also simplified, you can use an armor or an weapon set only when you have the full set, you find pieces of these sets hidden in the levels also they aren't many and give some stat improvements but they cannot be combined.Also besides combat  you have puzzles which add some flavour to the game and in some levels you can use cannons which also adds to the game.In the end although the game is simpler than other AAA games , its good story and decent combat will keep you interested as you find out the secret of the holy grail and who is the first templar :)The good: Combat                      Puzzles                     StoryThe bad:rpg featuresFinal Rating 7/10			"

												Decent hack 'n slash with good mechanics, passable story and graphics. If you're a fan of the genre, worth picking up when on sale. Co-op is an added bonus.The story itself is pleasantly uncomplicated. I didn't even bother much with it. What's that? We're a knight in search of the Holy Grail? Whatever. Let's get our swords out and start slashing. The voice acting is generally good, but nothing outstanding. The atmosphere is great, though; the desert fortress of Acre is bright and dusty, while the village and swamps at the base of Montsegur castle are drab and dark. Environments in general are nicely detailed - not earth-shattering, but nice. You'll come across some incredibly low-res rocks and water at odd places in the game (usually towards the end). Fire and smoke are particularly well-rendered. This is not an open world btw; travel too far one way or another, and you'll come up against an invisible wall. The combat is very quick to learn, and the upgrade tree is very deep. There is some stealth (very easy), some boss battles (hard, but not too hard), Switching from one character to another is simple and seamless: just hit the Tab key to change to the other character. And you will need to do this to solve some of the dungeon puzzles. The puzzles themselves aren't that hard to complete, though if you charge in without analyzing the situation first, you'll die quickly.That's the problem with The First Templar: there's nothing really outstanding about it, but it is not a bad game either. It is average in just about every quantifiable category. I had fun with it. Not a must-buy at the current list price of $20; at $6 or less, though, it's a fun game to while away a few hours.If you're purchasing for the co-op, only the hosting player gets achievements, so be sure to take turns hosting the game.

I don't forget that the game is already 5 years old and I think graphics are decent, not best, but on high settings game is satisfying. I quite liked story and mainly dubbing. Coop is very good addition to game, because your AI friend can be dull. Even the bonus in form ""The Arena"" is pretty good.

												The First Templar leaves me with mixed feelings. One the one hand it's a very fun and engaging game to make your way through with a friend, but on the other hand it has little problems here and there that mar the gameplay. It seems like it was sloppily put together and could have been better constructed all around in order to make the gameplay more fluid. It's a decent game to go through at least once and is definitely worth picking up.It's hard to judge The First Templar by the usual standards, since almost everything here has two sides. Fairly good story, but dated graphics. Interesting combat system – annoying stealth sequences. Big levels – linear corridors. But ultimately, you will be remembering these 10+ hours of non-stop swashbuckling with a smile on your face.The sneak mechanic is fun, as it's always fun to visit death upon unsuspecting enemies, but it is admittedly a little broken. Enemy line of vision is poorly handled, to say the least.Combat can unfortunately be a little repetitious, with the basic attacks mapped on two buttons and a few mapped to others. This leaves a very strong impression of the game being a button masher which it tries to rectify by giving the characters special attacks they can perform to break up the gameplay. Sadly though, some of the moves aren't the most responsive.Each level has main objectives for you to complete as well as additional, bonus objectives that serve to give you more experience for your characters. They also contain a variety of collectibles in the form of chests and tablets. The chests contain various items, ranging from experience to new outfits for the characters.The story of the game is actually quite interesting, with the characters trying to figure out where to find the Grail amidst the mystery of what is happening with the King betraying the Templar order. All in all, this is a fairly decent game. Overall 7/10.			"

												Utter garbage with overly restrictive drm! Avoid at all costs and don't let curiosity get the best of you. There are plenty of better third-person action games than this. Hell, The Witcher 2, AC:Revelations, AC:Black Flag, Dark Souls I & II, Onimusha, etc. Catch them on a good sale at least. So please save your hard earned money and spend it on something worth your respect, you've earned that.			"

												Do not buy this game. It looked like it would be fun to play with a friend, but the coop feature relies on logging into a third-party server. That normally wouldn't be a problem, except for the fact that the server was never up. No response from dev team, and when I contacted Steam, they said that the game doesn't offer multiplayer.

												So sad I've wasted my money on this crappy game. Ok, first, you need to create an account. Then you play the solo campaign, and you realize it's a total crap. So, you want to try the multi, right ? And guess what ? You need to create another account ! Awful, but doable, right ?Problem : once you've done it, you can't even create a multi game, you need to link your account to Facebook first, and then play only with your Facebook friends !Whoever thought about this system need to either stop taking drugs, or stop making video games.Worst game ever.

												This is definitely a cute little game to get if you can get it cheap. (I got it for about .50 USD)  It made a pretty decent transition from console to PC and the graphics are still pleasant to the eye.  There are a few issues with it, but there are also a few workaround considering how few people currently play.  It's definitely a nice casual co-op if you just want to hang out with a friend, or you can solo it just as casually.PROS:-- Pretty easy controls (keyboard or controller)-- Pretty easy to understand Tips panel and not-in-the-way live time pop ups during gameplay-- Pretty cute humor and plot holes that are a great laugh with a friend-- Decent plot and enviornment transitions-- Co-op is pretty smooth.-- Not too hard, not too easy-- Nice variety between NPC skillsCONS:-- Content issues not worth base price-- Can't make a private match (due to broken facebook link -- make a public and have friend join on you works fine)-- The server HOST has to level up the GUEST player-- Some objectives have small glitches that can bum ya out-- No options to change vertical and horizontal camera axis, making it a large learning curve on keyboard/mouse combo			"

												Very cautious recommendation here. If you're able to pick it up cheap and play it with a good friend, you'll probably have a good time.  Some of the environments are pretty interesting, and a couple of the puzzles are clever. However, there are some frustrations. First off, the combat is a little stilted.  The player is given a dodge-roll and a counter, but the timing on these seemed to be very stingy. Even after 11 hours with the game, I was never able to devise the actual rules that govern the counter (Can you only counter moves after the grey crossed blades are above the enemies heads? What about moves that aren't telegraphed? Do I need to be facing the enemy?, etc.).  With the dodge-roll, the player is given a sort of window that doesn't altogether make that much sense. With certain enemies, I would attempt to dodge-roll away more than a second before a blow landed, only to stand there watching myself get hit. There are also some hit-detection issues with traps in the game.  Often you'll find yourself hit by a trap that you pretty clearly dodged. The game also does this strange thing where despite the directional movement of a blade or spikes, you will always be pushed backwards towards the direction you came from, even when this makes no physical sense.  Lastly, there are multiple ""duels"" in the game, in which the second player simply stands on the sideline watching the other playing fight.  Pretty audacious move by the Devs, having me watch their mediocre combat in action, haha.  Despite all this, I had quite a few laughs playing this game, and I don't regret the time I spent with it.

Graphics are well useable, you will do a bit of fighting, and tower defence then some bosses, so there is a nice mixture to break up the gameplay.You can play as a female or male so there’s another choice in game play.Get it on sale, and it’s a nice little game for your library.

												A decent, fun game with a good amount of historical facts. My game rating: 74.5 / 100Graphics: 65 / 100Whilst character graphics are done fairly well, I feel as if the ground was not given enough details. Graphics could definitely be better, but they still fit in quite well and do not ruin your experience. Story: 78 / 100It is true that the story feels slightly unchanging. For most parts of the game you are infiltrating castles or camps, but the story itself does keep you interested and hungry for more. Furthermore, aside of the storyline of the game, it offers you the story of the knight Templars in small portions that you get by discovering stone tablets. I have enjoyed this addition very much as it brings the age of Templars alive and closer to you.Combat mechanics: 76 / 100As everything else in the game, combat is developed to that point where you just begin to like it. Trick with the combat module in this game is that there are 3 characters that you may chose to control at any time during the game, and all 3 of them have different skill trees that come with different attacks. As you progress through the game, you may chose to upgrade your attack moves and unlock new ones. Game also offers huge difficulty spikes between the difficulty modes which is great in my opinion. This allows you to chose whether you would like to go through the game without much stress or perhaps chose a more realistic mode. Sometimes you also get awarded with a kill cam. I enjoyed it.Fun factor: 79 / 100Is the game worth its price (14eur)? I am not sure, it depends what you are looking for. If you do buy it, do not forget to check out the Arena.Recommendation!			"

												The First Templar starts off fairly weak: a brief voiceover describing the Knights Templar and the central protagonist Celian's obsession with finding the Holy Grail, before cutting to him and his fellow knight Roland finding a murder scene at a small church, cutting between observations like half the pages had fallen out of the script. However, after this shakey opening the game picks up speed fairly quickly.My first impression of the game was that it was similar to Viking: Battle for Asgard; an inoffensively average hack n' slasher with a few stealth elements. And while this assessment isn't entirely inaccurate, the longer I played the more I got NWN2 vibes from it. It's not really an RPG - your equipment is purely aesthetic and by endgame you can afford to fill basically your entire skill tree, and the only choice you're allowed to make is literally the last thing you do in the entire game - but it's very much the same sort of feel of incredibly proficient killers wandering into incident after incident while trudging in the general direction of their actual goal.The player characters, while rather simple, get a bit endearing after a while, bantering constantly while navigating terrain and trap, but besides them there are precisely three other characters that get any level of characterization to them besides plot device to move the story forward. Celian himself is unfortunately a bit bland, a generic grizzled badass whose only apparent character traits are an almost crippling hero complex and a mild phobia of rats (which comes up precisely twice and never has any affect on story or game). Even so, his unabashed good-guy nature had some charm to it, making the game feel like a magic-free DnD campaign where you play as a paladin.One thing that helps distinguish it from Viking: BfA is that the stealth mechanics actually work - sort of. When you're detected things switch into action mode instantly, giving no margin for error. Thankfully the minimap lets you know precisely where the enemy's sightline is and your support character is handy for quickly dispatching guards in pairs, making winding through an enemy camp with a series of neck snaps feel like a cooly effecient guerilla mission.The combat itself is also nicely varied, with enough different ways to punch people's faces in that I was still experimenting with it by game's end, but with a small enough menu that you weren't left simply forgetting half the controls. My only real complains are that the combo attacks can be finnicky at best, often resulting in me shield-bashing an opponent I had been trying to bowl over, and that especially in late game enemy health becomes ridiculously high, with fat, shirtless torturers somehow able to tank half a dozen heavy sword blows to the chest. The fact that you never gain any upgrades to your basic damage output doesn't help.All in all, I recommend trying it out if you like fun little hack-n'-slash games that aren't worried about being especially ambitious. However, I will leave one further criticism without explanation. You'll understand if you play through it.♥♥♥♥ bear traps.			"

												There is Incredible Simplicity in the way its made that just keeps getting you more interested the more you play it.	The fact that the environment are used most similarly as a painting is used as ""Something to look at."" In Comparison to other games that require the 'Hunting &Pecking"" involved in finding Every Single Item, this game really gets with it, and cuts to the chase. 	That every place you have to run mostly you will be doing this. But before I go into that I want to say what an incredible job was put into all the detail(from the plants, fountains, stairways, doorways, archways, demigod statues, just about anything you can think of this side of Rome. 	Speaking of Rome but this ones in France this time & throughout the entire English, French, Dutch, Swiss, Italian, German, maybe perhaps Eastern block as well. Basically all over that country-side (and beautiful if you have not visited Europe, 	You can either play this to get a flavor of that era. 	You and your fellow Templar(Which eventually becomes an♥♥♥♥♥♥kicking woman), have to find the beloved testament from 'heaven' sent to us, otherwise known to Indy movies/Excalibur/Monty Python as : the Holy Grail:	After youre finally thru about a 'dozen separate areas' this areas are quite spansive, and I mean filled out every single detail like a drunks over-sized MGD on a Saturday night out at the pub.	There's a lot at stake here, and the almighty himself has to step up and help. I know, youre wondering how Jesus could get involved,but , not him. At least not yet. 	It is the ""Pope"" ""The Pontus"" ""Romes Greatest Adversary in the Middle Ages"". When they actually had a job of not only avoiding getting murdered,to fight for the churches, to aid in discovering things that others cannot. 	This is starting to sound confusing like an old silent movie classic with keystone cops, but its more like episode of starsky and hutch, only with cooler costumes SWORD @ times SHIELD or KARATEKICKING:	So after you get through most of the first chapters, the thing I began understanging was that there is no 'Pointing and CLicking' on every thing thats not nailed down. 	All you have to do is look for one or two things: Crates(For upgrades), and Water Barrels(or some Grilled food item(Health no doubt, and no (theres no Bano as much eating and drinking they do. 	Other wise the only things to interact with in the levels are :DOORS : For battering down usuallly without a ram.PILES OF CRATES: to burn down(for entrances, or just to be damn mean)			"

												Don't buy into the low meta-critic score of this game. Those reviews do point out problems that this game has, but at the same time most write that the game is enjoyable.If you are a fan of historical RPG, and are willing to overlook some technical flaws, you will enjoy this game.First off, I just finished my first playthrough of the game. It took me 20-something hours. Here are my impressions:Worst problem: character animations. They feel unfinished. Most characters walk around stiff, as if they are only held upright due to some painful shaft stuck up... I was surprised to see the finishing credits showing a team of 5 character animators. They really dropped the ball on this one. However the combat finishing move animations are very satisfying to watch.Good points:The story is great. People who say otherwise either haven't progressed enoug in the storyline to where it becomes engrossing, or else they simply don't appreciate the scenario (and why buy the game if you don't?)Combat is simple but fun. There is no level system, but fighting earns you XP which you use to purchase and upgrade skills. I never really had to rely on any of the combat skills until the final battle though. I played on normal difficulty.I loved the voice acting. Again, some people wrote otherwise. The voice acting of the main character is simply awesome. To each his own, I suppose. I can only thing that some folks can't appreciate what was done here.The traps in this game will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off (maybe in a good way). They are challenging, and will likely have you cursing out loud.Lastly, the game supports local co-op (split screen). Which is quite rare for PC games. There is also online co-op apparently (I did not try that).My bottom line: if you look at this game and think, ""hmm, I might enjoy this"" then you probabbly will enjoy this game. Don't let yourself miss out on a fun time due to some over-critical reviews. "

The story kept me interested for about 2/3's of the way through it, but it wasn't great story. The fight mechanics were like a cheaper Arkham game style, but still held up well. It also has partial controller support(even though steam doesn't say it). I however couldn't get the game to register that I was using one to play. It kept giving me keyboard promts.

												Janky 3rd person melee action adventure with semi-RPG'ish skill leveling.Very bad mouse control, extremely annoying forced sign-on to Kalypso account and changes to display settings are not saved.But there is also a pretty decent coop/buddy AI, so there's that.			"

												I'm not sad I played this.Once you get past the first puzzle - a gate that opens for one networked player and not the other, forcing a restart - The First Templar can be more entertaining than not playing The First Templar.There was a good puzzle at the end.Recommended for co-op!P.S Amazing things happen if you play local co-op with two controllers on an accidentally un-powered USB hub.

			http://store.steampowered.com/app/57680 http://steamcommunity.com/app/57680/discussions/0/522730700845568888/ - how to play with a controller Follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/Little_B_Gaming...		

 http://steamcommunity.com/app/57680/discussions/0/522730700845568888/ - How to setup a controller  The written review is too long to fit here, so for more thoughts on the game, check my video review For hundreds of years people are trying to find the Holy Grail – it's a cup, dish, plate or stone. Probably depends where you read about it. It's thought to have divine powers like eternal youth. Only handful of people manage to get their hands on it but they always lost it. One such a person is Indiana Jones. The other is the main characters here Celian d'Arestide. It's not a spoiler. Right in the beginnig the narrator is saying it. This is the First Templar - highly underrated, that in my opinion came in the wrong time. The problems the game have are probably related due the fact it's port and not a great one. And also some weird decisions.The game is released in 2011 and I think even for the time it wasn't that good looking. It have a lot of video option and it runs fine on Windows 7 with 60 fps, but no matter how high you put all settings, it won't impressed you. Characters and textures looks plastic. If I  didn't know the released date, i'd probably say it came out around 2005. Graphics are not bad, just okay.You play (mainly) Celian d'Arestide, a knight templar who devoted his life in searching of the Holy Grail. With him is his brother in arms Roland, another templar. One minor spoiler ahead. After about an hour into the game, Roland is replaced with Marie d'Ibelin and with her they travel the world in search for the Grail. Parallel to your quest, you will save a lot of people, even help a city to fight off an attack. Part of the game takes place in time of persecution of the Templars  The story is okay. It have few twists, but it's not the best story ever written in a video game, but it's enjoyble. It connects the dots.What is more enjoyble is the combat. You can play with mouse and keyboard or controller. The game doesn't support generic controller, but I used one and to see how I done it, see the link I provided. If you played Batman Arkham series, you will feel almost like home. The game have similar rhytmic combat, but it have few twist that I like. Make no mistake Batman Arkham series combat is more fluid. The production values are a lot higher. The small difference here is blocking and counterattack. When enemy is about to make a move, icon above his head appear. Then if you don't want to dodge-roll, you have to face him to do counter or block. You can't just spam the buttons and hope to do what is supose to do, when your back is against the enemy. For perfect block and counterattack you have to press the corresponding button at the right time. I like that, because it offers more tension in the combat, especially when you are surrounded. At first is counterintuitive, but I got used to it fast.The gameplay is great .You have only one basic combo in the beginnig, but you can buy new ones from the skill menu. In game they are called Special attacks. All are important. They are not many. This is not a spectacle fighter. After each battle you will be rewarded with xp points. With them you can upgrade existing combos or buy new. Special attacks are really important, because enemies tend to block your regular moves and with them you can brake their defense. Of course they are not only for that. The combat in the game is satisfying and almost perfect. I think it needs little more audio and visual feedback to feel more meaty. There is one perticular thing I like in the combat – the finishing moves. When a single enemy is left there is a chance to trigger one. They are nice little touch and I never got tired of seeing themOther things you can buy from the skill menu is additional Health and Zeal orbs and they way you restore them. Health orbs are basically another health bar. More you have, longer you'll live. Life is restore by eating or drinking water. They fill even your Health orbs.Special attacks and other moves require Zeal orbs. They are replenish by fighting, but with upgrades you do it even by killing enemies. As I said blocking is essential for surviving, because there is upgrade for getting Zeal orbs by blocking at the right time and therefore you can make Special attacks and so on. It's full circle.The game can be played in split screen or online. I didn't try them, but I can safely say, your AI parter is quite capable of dealing with enemies. This is such a suprise. He or she have their skill menu and you have to buy for them upgrades. To my hugh suprise the AI  uses Special attacks and even replenish his life! First I thought, that they will never use any of the moves I buy for them, but they do and this help a lot. You also have few basic commands for your teammate. I've never ever seen before better AI partner. Well, you will do most of the killing and of course the AI will do stupid things, it's not perfect, but still I stay behind my words.A small part of the gameplay is stealth. With one or two exeptions, it's not forced, but it's useful dealing with multiple enemies. It's kinda cluncky, because it just duck or hide behind a cover and wait for opportunity to snap a neck. Even when you are out in the open, the enemy won't notice you as long you crouch an stay out of sight. The focus of the game is action not stealth, but it's still this part could be better. Most of the levels are not design with stealth in mind.Level design is okay. You will visit a giant mansion, an oasis in a desert, the Middle East, Asia, dungeons filled with traps, castles, abbey, villige and so on. They are all nice, but it's too bad you can't explore more of them. I really love the places full of traps. It feels like i'm Indiana Jones. Levels are linear, but exploration is rewarded. There are hidden chest with parts for new clothes or weapons, xp or buffs and other stuff to find. Clothes and weapons don't offer any additional bonuses, so it's not require to equip them. They are just cosmetics. Enemies you encounter are more or less the same with few exeptions. Different types of soldiers, bandits with swords, axes, spears and so on. In one level you will encounter hashashins, that are using daggers and jump a lot. In other places you will fight a tall ogre-looking creatures, but the main character said that they are humans. This is not fantasy game. As a setting is more realistic. Enemy AI won't surprise you if you played similar game to Batman Arkham series. They surround you and waiting to beat them, and from time to time they make regular or special attack. All the bosses here are fun. They make tons of damage and if you are not using all acquired skills and the shield, you will die easily.Sound design is okay at best. Voice acting is passable. Most main characters voices are decent, but side characters and NPC's are bad. It's not awful as a whole, but it could be better. Celian have a gruff voice of course.Effects are also okay. As a mention in the beginning the game could use better audio feedback, when you slice enemy. There is one really weird thing here. Sometimes when enemy dies wilhelm scream can be heard. Why? I don't see the point. It tooks me out of immersion, especially when I killed the final boss. It's out of place.Music is not really memorable. Most places have different theme, but a lot of times when fight arose, you will here the same track over and over again.			"

												I went into this with fairly low expectations, but I was very pleasantly surprised. The story caught and held my attention, and I loved the characters (especially Marie). The scenery is pretty gorgeous, and the audio and voice acting was pretty solid. Character models are a little dated, but considering this is a few years old thats to be expected. Combat isnt overly special, just button mash to win, but I had fun during the boss fights and found smashing guards to be pretty relaxing as the game went. Stealth was pretty fun. Sneak up behind guards and snap their necks, which was a great way to break up any boredom in guard-smashing. Linear, but I dont really see that as an entirely bad thing considering the lack of map. Also felt like it helped the story keep its pace, especially in the later levels.There are chests to keep an eye out for, as well as to explore the rooms/areas that arent on the linear path. The chests are buffs for that level like extra health, extra zeal, extra abilities, or costumes. Collect all the costume pieces and you can unlock different costumes for the main character and both party members.Puzzles werent anything special. I cringed the first time it made me try to use both characters to solve a puzzle, until I realized how player-friendly the party member controls are when it comes to puzzles. Tell a member to stop following you, and even if you swap the character you are playing as, the other stays put. Park them near a level, and an extra option will pop up letting you tell them to pull a lever without swapping to them. Overall, Id recommend it if you like story-driven games and dont mind some hacknslash when it comes to combat.			"

												This game looks, plays and feels to unfinished and empty.Between quests there just doesn't happen anything.I think the developers did not think that their cool game concept would fail.Hell, what's more fun than a co-op game with two templar knights that level up like an RPG and gives you man to man sword fight? Not this end product i would think. I played a very early version on the Gamescom in Germany and the game altough riddled with bugs at that time, looked and played different than the final product.I remember telling myself:When this (RPG?) game is released i'm going to buy it.When the day finally came for release i even preordered it thinking about what i had seen and played....After installing i loaded the game and started playing...First of all... The graphics are now different and loads of promised elements were (i think) cut from the game.There is nothing that has been done correct.After annoying the crap out of myself for buying, believing and playing this turd for a few hours with a friend i quit playing this terrible excuse of a game and uninstalled this (at the time) 40 Euro piece of garbage...NOT RECOMMENDED!! (it's an understatement) I think after all this time i would rate this 2 out of 10.Really... The nerve some developers have for releasing something as bad, unpolished and unfinished as The first Templar...			"

												Well What can I Say about This Game.Unfortunatly, I thought This game At First, May actually be Decent, Online Coop, Action RPG. Sounds Good, Right? But once i started Playing, The AI Ran into a wall Continuously for 5 minuites Straight! REALLY!? And when I went to test The Coop, One the Login Did Not work and why did it not work you may ask. It was all because the games Servers Went Down Years Ago. Well That was £10 Wasted.So Overall, It Could have been An Great Indie RPG because the Story Is Pretty Interesting and the Combat Is very fluent But Unfortunatly, The Ai IS Horrible and having the coop servers down, Which was actually what I bought the game For, Just ruined IT.I Unfortunatly Cannot Recommend This Game.

If you hate games where you can get through by pressing the same button over and over, only to be stuck with predictable puzzles then I wouldn't bother with this. I neither recommend or hate this game, it's more one of those games to kill a day or two of gaming never to be touched again, unless craving some random hack & slash gameplay that is best played with a friend rather than solo.

												Wish I could recommend this but there are too many problems. First off, the combat. You basically mash the one attack because you can only use other buttons for special abilities when you've built up enough zeal so it gets super repetitive fast. You only use the same weapon throughout the entire game without upgrading it. As for leveling up. Although you can upgrade traits it is mostly just ""more health/zeal/damage"" or a few different special attacks, but they all require zeal, which is stupid because then you will just be using one of the attacks so you're basically replacing the attacks you just leveled up, but never changing your basic boring attack which becomes not as effective. In combat that are problems. They throw you into combat fighting groups of 6 guys that just attack you from behind while you try to attack someone else. And to make this worse, blocking wont turn you to block the guy attacking you, meaning if you're attacking some guy and stop and try to block the person attacking from behind you'll still get hit, which is dumb. Enemies can for some reason be in the middle of getting hit by your sword combo and just start attacking you, making you trying to do combos useless. You would think there is a pattern, but you have no idea when they'll do it making you just want to attack once at a time. Also there is only 1 way to break shields and they always can and will attack you when you are forced to do it. Enemies can hit you even when out of range and hitboxes on enemies sometimes aren't right. The levels get boring as its the same thing of you running into groups of 5 guys of the same enemy types and pressing the single attack button to hurt them. There are also some very poorly designed checkpoints that force you through multiple annoying parts again. Also, healing in combat is stupid. They give you healing objects but you have to stand next to them and interact and it takes 3 seconds of uninterrupted standing to get health, making them useless when you actually need them, in combat, as someone will attack you. Very dumb design decision. There are secrets to find but they are also poorly done. Markers show you where to go which is nice and sometimes you have to follow footsteps which I enjoyed, but there is no actual maps and sometimes you can miss secrets because you see the direction of where it is but can't find how to get there and there isn't a map to check. Also, some secrets unlock new costumes and different looking weapons (without stat changes), but this is poorly done also. They are broken up into parts of course scattered across levels. Which means in order to get a new sword you need to find 3-4 boxes in different levels, meaning you need to get every secret or get lucky that the ones you find are them or you've just wasted time. That means you could have done the hard work to find 3 boxes of the costume but since you missed that one box in a certain corner of the level you now don't get it........very stupid. The game is very long and the story is actually interesting. Graphics are also fine, although voice acting is terrible as well as face animation/movements and body movements. During conversation faces dont move and people make stupid gestures with their bodies. 5/10.			"

												Got it on sale for $3, still wishing I hadn't made that stupid decision of dumping 3 bucks on this one. I believe most of my frustrations about this game have already been covered by older reviews, but I'm still gonna rant about it for the heck of it anyway. First off, the graphics leave a lot of room for improvements, nothing special, generic and plain, although at times it can look kinda pretty, hit and miss mostly. Characters look funny, though this can be a matter of opinion, and they move in an awkward manner as if someone glued a giant board to their backs. As an avid fan of open world game, this game dissuaded me from playing due to its linear gameplay, you don’t have the luxury of going wherever the heck you want.  Combat is forgettable and unimpressive. Though I can tolerate some of the stated flaws, my main beef with the game is the control. REVERSE MOUSE CONTROL. And the game doesn’t even have an option to change that. “Oh, you’d like to see where you’re going? How about we show you the ceiling instead? Isn’t the sky just lovely today?” Simply put, you point up, the screen goes down and vice versa. I was struggling with it and it felt like most of my effort in playing this game went into maintaining a proper field of view. On a side note, when I finally got somewhat used to the stupid control, I went back to playing other games with NORMAL mouse control and it all went bananas for me as once again I had to struggle to revert to how I used to play those game before I had to adapt to the clunky control of this game. Can’t say anything about the plot because I haven’t gotten very far in as evidenced by my playing time and because everything about this game just discourages me completely. My advice, don’t waste your money on it even on a sale, and if you’ve made the mistake that I did? Don’t repeat my mistake of wasting time with it. Bury it in your backlog. "

												This game may have passed for an excellent action game in the early 2000s, but for a game release in 2011, this game is rather sad.  The voice acting is spot on, however the characters themselves are a bit...two dimensional.  There's ""funny"" banter here and there.The fighting is lathargic once you get the hang of it.  Having three, well, two different fighting styles would be interesting, however this game doesn't pull it off too well.			"

												I bought this game with the BundleStars reboot 4.0 bundle for 2 bucks. Glad I didnt waste any more money on it. Game requires you to register an account, ok no problem except that the Launcher glitches out and shows the steam overlay behind the text boxes and in front of the buttons that allow you to finish registering. I have tried about 9 times now to get registered, no option to register on the game's website, overall just a lousy ♥♥♥♥ing game launcher.			"

												Not a bad game not a $20 game though maybe $10 i'd probably only give $5 i got it from a bundle so i didn't even give $5 lol Better than 57 meta least a 67. graphicly not as impressive as most 2011 games are graphics are more of a 2008ish look. The story seems pretty decent so far heavy christian based sub-story but that should be expected from anything ""Knight Templar"" based. Combat is simple fun finishers but game could have seriously used more gore lol I mean finisher acts like going to decapitate an enemy and he just falls over ya know? Best gore you see is the blood on your sword so pretty simple gore. has co-op never tried it probably wont but i belive it would be fun. No character levels in the game but plenty of active and passive skills to hone exp is the cost of skills rather than say skill points per level. No open world you go the way that was programmed for you to go. No buying armor or weapons no customization what so ever any armor or weapons you get you find either as rewards or chests all outfits are pre-made. Stealth could have been better but it works for this game i suppose.  Overall 6/10 i recommend it if you can snag it in a bundle or onsale for under $5-$10 for $20 save your money for something you been eyeing up on that cost same price or multiple games for $20			"

I really enjoyed this game.It had its ups and downs, but overall it was playable. I can say for sure that this game is really addicting for some reason. First time i played it, i thought i was wasting my time with this game (i got this game from a bundle and tried to give a go), because it looked kinda bad in the beginning and the voice acting made me laugh. But when you focus on the story, you will completely ignore the bad things about this game and play the hell out of it. I really loved that you could do bonus objectives and find loot, because i dig these kind of things in games. Using stealth hasn´t been this much fun also - you can easly kill anyone that is in your way or just break the game hiding in the bushes, while the game sends a group of men against you and you can just sneak away. The puzzles were sometimes kinda lame and annoying, but theres more killing than puzzle solving in the game. Haven´t tried the multiplayer, so can´t say nothing about it. So overall, i would give this game a solid 8 out of 10, because i haven´t had an enjoyment of a game this big in a while. I would strongly advise to get this game when its cheap OR if you have the balls and money, you could get this game for full price.			"

												The voice acting is laughable, not ""so bad it's good"" like for example in the Just Cause games or Boiling Point, but simply terrible and out of place. I can't tell if it's a technical problem or the actors are that unprofessional. The animations are awkward and stiff, more so in the cutscenes. The graphics might be okay and in places you can even spot some impressive landscapes of the war, but only if you can get past the low-res textures and numerous glitches. The story seems to be just a means to drive the action and not the other way around as you'd expect. There are some interesting ideas here and there, a few details might get you curious about the outcome, but in the end you'll find it was just a silly plot, too convoluted for its own good and unnecessarily confusing.  The characters would be much cooler if they were somehow given a chance to develop properly, unfortunately you won't find much of a distinct personality in any of them, and there are three characters with immense potential and a bit of backstory.Fortunately, the gameplay is a whole lot of fun. Each of the three characters that you can choose to play (when the story lets you) have unique combat skills that you can upgrade, you can use ranged attacks or slash your way with swords and knives, even the stealth missions have their own appeal. Then there's the puzzle solving, which is a great diversion, but the AI shows its awful nature here and it's best to play these sections co-op. While you're at it, play the whole game co-op, because that's where the game shines most. Switch between character with your buddy, earn achievements togheter, and you can even play in split-screen mode. That's awesome. So, if you're bored or waiting for some new triple A title, give this game a try, it's cheap as hell and offers a good value for what is worth.			"

												It starts nice and interesting, but this game is boring. Really boring.After the first few hours nothing changes aside from settings and story. You just end up doing the same things over and over, figting reskins of the same exact enemies using brainless combat mechanics and a couple moves and button prompts.Puzzles arn't very engaging, combat mechanics are extremely shallow and repatitive, and aside from the graphics there isn't much I really liked about the game, for a budget game, it dousn't do anything new and aside from the setting and story theres no reason would have played it as much as I have. The main issue is the combat is just so boring, it undermines all the other work because I don't feel like I even want to play this game again.The story also goes down the Assasins Creed magical♥♥♥♥♥♥road and gets a bit silly because of this. I was hoping for a more educational video game about the templars but nope, its just more fantasy♥♥♥♥♥♥Theres nothing to really say about it, its just a boring budget game that makes me think and want to go play the old LOTR games that shared the same names as the movies. Those were good games and this game is only like 1 to 10% of the game that those are.			"

We were immortal, we were all-powerful. We were gods. Yet ultimately we brought merely pain and suffering. We failed.I love the atmosphere on the Knights Templar, the Crusades, and that period of time. It's sad that games of such theme are not enough.After 19h+ (without Arena DLC, 23-24h with DLC, fighting with achievements):PROS+ very long game+ Templars+ finishers+ side quests+ silent killing+ maybe searching for tracesCONS- too long game- painful linear as hell- total lack of choosing dialogues- underdeveloped combat system + AI based on 'nec Hercules contra plures'- useless skill tree- cosmetic equipment- underdeveloped riddles + tiring final labyrinth- you might miss an extra mission or treasure because you kill too fast talking guards and you should hear them (facepalm)- after load you lose all your collected Zeal orbs Subjective rate: D (I like the Templars, but this here is not enough, otherwise this game doesn't deserve to be called cRPG, but I recommend it only for lack of something more interesting)			"

												This is a really OK game. Nothing really stood out to me that made this anything other than a very generic hack and slash adventure game. The levels are extremely one-way. The move set you have is very limited...I basically finished the game by only using the main basic attack (left click), there is no other attacks available...The story is horribly slow paced and dull, characters are no better, they all seem very bland and uninteresting.This is also a really bad port, you are unable to play in 1080p, you have to set your resolution to something weird...that is just unacceptable in this age of pc gaming.  I also experienced some frame rate drops, but this was fixed by using vsync. The one and only redeeming factor is that you can do local co-op, this is something which is an instant bonus in any game as it adds to the fun factor of being able to sit on the sofa and have a laugh with a buddy while playing a poor game.Skip this one.

												This game is horrible. I like the stuff Kalypso has put out in the past decade except this piece of trash. SO SO SO bad. Voice acting is god awful. I like linear but there is linear and then there is this. Split paths in this game don't exist. In the 3 or 4 hours I played of this, every single optional path had a clear treasure that you could see from the main, so you would just run back and grab what you were missing. No mystery etc. The graphics belong on the N64. In fact that's an insult to the N64. Don't waste your money or your time. If you want a cheap, generic RPG from Kalypso, get the GoT RPG. It uses the exact same character models and voice actors but surprisingly its good.			"

												Before I begin I would like to point out, that I played on the hardest difficulty with a Co-Op partner, and finished the game completely (while also getting all costumes and weapons/ doing every side quest in each level).This game is without a doubt one of the worst hack-and-slash games I've ever played. It has been compared to Assassins Creed, and Dragon Age, but lacks any of the fun and ingenuity those games had. The voice acting and writing are atrocious, and sitting through the painful dialogue is truly the game's most difficult aspect. 90% of the conversations between the two protagonist characters follow the formula of the secondary character saying ""Oh no! Do we really plan on *insert current mission objective here* all by ourselves?"", and the main character responding with ""Yes"" or some other mumbled one-to-three word affirmation. The game-play itself is incredibly simplistic, and requires the player to mash the mouse1 button to build up enough ""zeal"" before any of the advertised ""furious combos"" can be utilized. The enemy AI isn't challenging at all, with the difficulty coming from the player's attacks themselves. The AI is programmed to cheese the players at every opportunity, knocking them down or poking them with their sword while they are mid-combo or already knocked down. This results in multiple instances of player knockdown spam, where your only escape is to roll away at the speed sound; like a cellophane-wrapped child just set on fire.Even with these flaws the game has some fun moments. For example, there are about 5 levels where your only objective is to navigate trap-filled tombs a-la ""Indiana Jones and the First Templar of Doom"". The problem is that these sequences are tiny gems in the otherwise massive and tedious narrative of the main story. Most levels have you slaying hordes or identical twin enemies with identical abilities every five feet, so the entire level feels like one continuous and draining spam fest. The 1 on 1 dueling segments are fun, but they really just serve to highlight the combat system's major flaws. Boss enemies will either spam unblock-able attacks, use their magnetic vacuum swords to suck you into their attack animations, or simply ignore being stabbed in the face and attack you mid-way through your own animations. Luckily for the players, healing items are scattered every 5 feet, so there's really no way for you to die.I can honestly say after playing this game from start to finished, both my Co-Op partner and I were desperate for the game to end 15 levels in. Little did we know, the game actually has a total of 20 different levels. Even when you reach the end of the story, there is little to no resolution, so you feel like your actions during the last 4-5 levels we're completely pointless and had no effect on anything. To be honest, I could forgive all of the game's flaws if not for the terrible level design. Each level is comprised of large areas with hidden chests and side quests. Unfortunately, your character moves (hilariously) at a snails pace, making navigating the levels a bore. On top of that, the level designers insisted on placing random and elaborate nooks and crannies that lead to absolutely nowhere. I cannot relate to you how many times I was searching for treasure chests around the map, found a promising path and thought ""Oh I found a secret!"", followed it to the end, and found naught but a bush or rock as my reward. Despite its many flaws, this game is truly a laugh riot and should be played by anyone attempting to get into video game design, if only to experience the overall horrid design decisions and hilarious bugs that plague the entire experience.2/10 Never Again, Tropico.**EDIT** Oh and I just remembered, one of the two main villain's fate (and the female character's entire reason for being part of the adventure) is never explored, he simply just walks away and is never mentioned again.

												While there are some rough edges, this is a really great adventure game.  There are stealth levels, combat levels, and puzzle levels (and occasionally a mix).  There are weapons and outfits to collect, but they're just cosmetic so you don't fall behind if you miss one.  There are a lot of skills to pick up, with multiple choices at any given time.  The story is engaging and there are several twists near the end, but those twists don't come out of nowhere - they make perfect sense in the story.  The AI for your companion is pretty decent, although not as effective as a good player. On the other hand, the checkpoint system is kindof annoying and the plot is very linear (except for one choice you can make at the very end of the game).  Overall, the pros outweigh the cons, though.			"

												This game is not very fun, and quite boring. It doesn't let you do much besides follow a linear path, and button mashing X with abandon to kill things. The RPG elements are pretty shallow, it's not really an RPG at all, more of a skill tree. The inventory system is called ""outfits"" FFS. I was enjoying the story, and I'll probably play it again because it's a very casual level of difficulty when played on ""normal"" mode that could kill a few hours of time. However, there are better games to play meanwhile.			"

												the combat a very very bugged ( enemie often become invulnerable for a long time if they perform certain attack ( attack they do in chain so they are invulnerable almost forever)  hard to make combo due to the unprecise way of hitting( it's just silly to the point your not having fun but just get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off because you cant hit them even if you anticipate their move.trap not made to kill you but just trap you and deprive you of one of your charater for the rest of the level....  speaking of trap  since the mouvement are a bit unprecise it's annoying when you have to evade series of trap... ( it's not hard because the trap a stupid and easy to figure out but it does become hard BECAUSE of the  way your  mouvement are...) The story to the point I stopped playing because of the gameplay is not very good and you primary charater often say stupidly obvious comment.. I would say a lot more negative stuff but comment only allow so much character....dont buy it			"

												This game has, by far, the most obnoxious DRM ever imagined. You have to register an account for the launcher in order to even launch the game. Then you need a second account in-game to actually play the game. THEN you need to link the game to your facebook account in order to play with friends. All of this in addition to the already blasphemous Steam DRM + serial key.Even without the astounding DRM though, the game is totally unremarkable. Do not buy.			"

It have finishers that often look like they were taken from said Witcher 2, but... not synced with new enemy. And with half the frames. You play it as average game, but some parts are so bad so they are actually enjoyable... I don't have words for it, see it yourself.			"

												For the $0.99 I paid for it, this is a masterpiece.The First Templar is far from a great game. In fact everything is just about average. Yet it's still an enjoyable game.There is no way I'd recommend this at full price. But this has gone on sale for around a dollar, a couple times now. Keep your eyes open for when it drops again.Pros: The story is actually fairly good & the characters are somewhat enjoyable.Mehs: Combat is average, but it's in that sweet spot between barely bearable & fun enough to keep you playing. BGM is pretty good, but cuts out at times. Character models are a little odd.Cons: The game is very linear. You need to create a Kalypso account & deal with their launcher. Gamepad controls take a ton of work to set & will never be right.(hard to explain, but it's awful)			"

												The story is very interesting but gameplay is freaking lame! Consider to buy this game when it's on sale only for its story!Pros:Interesting story!Beautiful word font!Nice Artwork!Outfit is changable and collectible!Music is fine!Knights!Cons:Useless and same skill tree for every characters!Weak and stupid AI!Boring combo and only do with Left and Right Mouse!Gameplay sucks!Sidequest sucks!

												I just bought this game to play with friend on CO-OP. Okay it kinda worked yes, but he cannot assign skill points as the game says he's ""Guest""So then we tried to link ourselves with facebook as the game wants and this is what we get {   ""error"": {      ""message"": ""Invalid redirect_uri: Sovelluksen m\u00e4\u00e4ritykset eiv\u00e4t salli annettua URL-osoitetta."",      ""type"": ""OAuthException"",      ""code"": 191   }}authentication doesn't work with any browser so i cannot recommend this game for you if you are going to play it on CO-OP with friend.

												Rating: 2/10For all those players who want to ""Co-op"" with your friend, think twice before you buy this. I bought this game with hope of ""Co-op"" with my friend and i tried the ""Facebook friend authentication"" system which gave an error on Chrome & Ie. Well we got to play the game without being ""facebook friends"", but then the game informed ""A Guest canno't learn any skills"". So basically whole talent tree is unavailable for player2.The game graphics we're decent & gameplay somehow playable but the friend system just messed everything up completely.Sent ticket to game makers & steam and asking for refunds.

												I was rather excited when I saw this game on sale, the game looked similar to assassins creed.. but looks are decieving as I soon came to see the game wasnt all I expected (and for a sale where you get this game for a dollar, I didnt expect anything much.)I feel the game needs more comsmetic work for the most part, the cotntrols are a bit slow and dont feel as responsive. all in all I say:PROS+decent characters+quite a few collectables +multiplayer+decent graphics-----CONS-the characters tend to respond slowly and the shielding feels like it forces a character to stand in one place, not able to move the shield to move from attacks from behind.-lips syncing is almost non existant.-enemies are way too easy to kill and tend to have bad AI.-skilltree  doesnt really feel like it affects anything that I noticed.-voice acting feels really bad in this, nobody seems show any emotion in anything they say, saw your master kill like 5 people then pray? ""oh..hi master"" like its average, no worry if hes ok or anything, which makes the characters really feel like robots.-the god awful unhuman stares the characters do without blinking in cutscenes.

Posted: October 16, 2014
												Okay, so where do I get started?First of all, the graphics! The graphics shouldn’t make or break a game, but it’s definitely in its favour if they look rather good. This game does not look good at all. It’s outdated, looks pretty darn ugly, and to top it off, the animations are rather shocking to say the least. Let me explain: When your character turns from one direction to the other, it should be smooth and look pretty good. What it shouldn’t be doing is snapping from one direction and then to the other instantly. There’s not really any in-between animation and you’re just sort of snapping from one direction to the other, and it just does not look good.Now, let’s get into the real meat of the game, or what should be the meat of the game, and that’s the gameplay. For a hack and slash game you want some nice, satisfying combat to make you feel like the true badass that you’re playing as, slicing up enemies left, right, and centre. This game does not feel like that at all. The combat feels light and is just kind of boring, it’s nothing too interesting and I’m sure in co-op you’re only going to get the chance to tell your buddy the same thing. The game also takes a crack at stealth, and goes for what most games do with stealth, which is as long as the enemy doesn’t see you; you can sneak up on them and crack their neck. Speaking of cracking necks, this games breaking neck animation is kind of ridiculously fast, and the sound effect they use for it is so short and sudden it just takes away even more from the experience.The story is rather dull and uninteresting, and left me doing the one thing I rarely do in games and that’s skip the cutscenes, because the way it’s all being told just can’t grab my attention, so I’m not even going to waste my time when it comes to the story.Lastly would be the audio, and more importantly, the music. The sound effects are okay, nothing special and not particularly good, but they serve their purpose. The music in this game is just another one of those things I don’t take too much notice with. The music hasn’t drawn me in at all, and certainly isn’t something I’d necessarily want to listen to again. Also, on a slight sidenote, there was a moment in the game where I was simply walking in a monastery, and there was literally no sound to speak of. It was utterly silent, no footsteps, and no music, it was just completely silent. A little bit of music would have been nice, but alas, there was nothing.All in all, this is definitely not a game I recommend. I haven’t enjoyed my time with it, the audio is just okay, the gameplay is plain and nothing special, and the story is just uninteresting. Not a game I would recommend spending your money on. There a many other games that are more enjoyable and more worth your time, and money! "

												Visuals are oldAnimations suck:No animation for a lot of events. sheating arms, changing walk direction, stopping walking etc. To eat food you touch it. And you can kick open chests. Combat is too simplistic and becomes extremely boring after a while. You fight with legions of the same enemies all the time. Beside some traps the game offers no challenge at all. The interaction between the players That Wilhelm Scream is not fun to hear all the time. Final Verdict: The game is a chore you have to do to progress a rather mediocre story.			"

												I'm not even kidding when I say this was one of the best co-op experiences I've ever had. You take on the roles of either Celian d'Arestide, or Roland de Saint-Omer who is also a total badass, which he demonstrates by punching his fists together every cutscene he's in. Sadly he is almost immediately pushed out of the game in lieu of another character, a woman whose name I can't remember and I guess she's a rogue type thing except the combat really doesn't allow for much variation besides hitting stuff in front of you and we were both very disappointed when we lost the cool guy.Celian, the main character, is a shieldbearing honorable templar warrior with a strong moral compass, unless somebody offers just a hint of resistance in which case he'll buckle and do pretty much anything. Early in the game, our two friends happen upon the corpse of a fellow crusader, and Roland suggests Celian takes his shield as it is of rather fine quality. Celian, mortified, objects as he believes it's disrespectful to loot the dead. Roland basically says 'You should grab it anyway because it is cool' and Celian does so. Celian is useless.Throughout your journey, you will come across giant babies and their smaller but still giant baby offspring, which might trick you into thinking the game has a fantasy element to it but nope. That's it. You got the giant babies and maybe some dogs, but mostly just schmucks with clubs and if you are lucky, swords. You will also see a group of poorly choreographed knights, and quiant little taverns. All in all, the game is a technical mess, but it's a hilarious mess.			"

												The First Templar (Haenimont, 2011)The First Templar is an action-adventure game (with some RPG elements) featuring the following core concept:  You and a friend embark on a quest in search of the holy grail;  visiting exotic locales, solving riddles and battling evil, all the while marvelling at the many fantastic sights and sounds experienced on the way.  And let me tell you, it WORKS.The highlight, in my opinion, is the co-operative play.  Every ounce of the game appears to have been designed to maximise the potential for teamwork.  In other words, co-operation isn't just a buzzword or an afterthought.  It is integral to the gaming experience.Of course you may still play in single-player, and the game is very good even then, but I found the story so interesting and the drama so involving that I appreciated being able to share the experience with a friend.Please note, I havn't played all the way through the campaign yet.  (It's a lengthy quest and you'll get your money's worth.)  Judging from the collectables I've gathered (gear and diary entries and so on), I surmise that my buddy and I are probably about three-quarters through the game.  Already I don't want it to end;  but all good things do.GRAPHICS -- 90 %The game looks glorious.  Just look at those textures!  Just look at that animation!  Even better is that it runs fast and smooth regardless of the amount of enemies, the size of the level or the amount of visual effects on-screen.  Just brilliant! SOUND -- 85%From the voice casting to the voice acting to the musical score to the sound effects everything is very well done.EXECUTION -- 95 %Here we come back to the game's core concept and how well it has been realised.  You feel like you're traversing strange lands.  You feel like you're on a quest of importance.  And the story plays out well, with a plethora of interesting revelations as things develop.ADDICTIVENESS -- 95 %Massively addictive.  I can't wait to see which location or fantastic revelation is lurking around the next corner.OVERALL -- 92 %A truly fantastic co-operative experience.  Single-player is still good but it's the co-op where this game shines.  And it does shine.			"

												A very compelling trivial campaign depicting the story of one the original nine Templars. Full of action and plot twists, there's no break from combat in this game. Added kill moves and a very small selection of skills add a sense of tactics to the game rather than just click to kill. Combat is entirely controlled by the player, blocking, moving, and when to strike. Overll, the combat is relatively easy as long as you have good timing and know when to block or dodge since there is no cooldown buffer meaning you can block or move mid-swing.The storyline is rather straight-lined but that does not mean it is a bad thing. The storyline gives another spin to the legend of the Holy Grail and to where it is being kept.All in all, it is a rather fun play for a 10 hour game and I would suggest this game to any gamer who is interested in role-playing or adventure games.

												Игра которую многие недооценивают, на  самом деле это настолько приличный дебют для разработчиков, которые смогли на движке Тропико сделать екшн, на интересную тематику, с вкраплениями исторических событий и приключениями в стиле Индиана Джонса. Вообщем советую товарищи, игра достойна Вашего внимания, просто нужно чуть чуть больше уделить внимание на сами детали, и она Вас приятно удивит.			"

												Great game!* Story kept me interested through the entire game. * Graphics are nice, but there are some (mostly minor) animations missing* Music is good* Gameplay is fun but the skillsystem could have been made better though* Coop is fun but achievements can only be earned by the host which is kind of stupid...I recomend buying the game as long as it's 50% (I got it when it was 75%) off. Personally I'd say its worth even the full price (actually 30€).			"

												Highly recommended if you enjoy hack and slash but dislike having to open every single box and search every enemy like in Skyrim...I really have to set the record straight on some of the things mentioned here. You can play in 1080p and it doesn't look as bad as many say. The fighting is not as simple as some of the reviewers say either, once you start upgrading there are lots of special moves that you can do, even with the keyboard and mouse as your controller.Yes the game is linear but often there are treasures and bonuses to be found when you take a small detour from the path.The game has interesting information on the Knights Templar, most of it seems historically correct.The first level is really bland but after that it only improves, the second of the 20th levels is a forest not unlike the Forest Near Flotsham in The Witcher 2, I really liked that.It's not all fighting either, there are footsteps to be followed, doors to be opened, secrets to be found.You have an AI or second player as your companion, I didn't try the second player but played with the AI and was pleasantly surprised by how good the AI player was handling himself/herself in the fights.I really enjoyed my run of 20 hours in this game and highly recommend it! You just have to get past the blandness of the first level...One point of criticism though, having to create an account for Kalypso to spam me on really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. I ended up using a fake mailinator account and that worked but still they should respect their paying customers more!			"

												I won't argue with the assertion that at the first glance this game looks like a cheap attempt to copy Assassin's Creed series with Templars as the protagonists, but in practice this careful attempt succeeded perfectly even above it's initial goal to tell a story from the other perspective.This game is unexpectedly pleasant in relation to the plot, graphics and gameplay. It knows it's limits and doesn't pretend to be what it can't be.And yes, at some points it's better than some of the latest Assassin's Creed games.			"

Then I discovered the great world of The First Templar. I mean, of course it is a modest game, but it is a very good modest game. I has a enjoyable gameplay, a well-built plot and well designed levels. If you can see further than graphics then you won't be disappointed.			"

												Surprisingly entertaining for a simple hack and slash game. Polished for the most part with only minor if noticable at all bugs. Only played single so I can only talk about that. Story isn't great but enough to keep you following along. To aquire new combos and abilites you gain experience and purchase them. The game is broken into chapters and each chapter has optional side objectives, makes the levels more interesting than just plowing through with the main objectives.I imagine some people are disappointed they can't play as Roland, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sword weilding fighting companion, more, or that he doesn't have more screen time. The other companion the double dagger weilding woman is the only character with range who can throw daggers. The main character shield and long sword who can charge into enemies shield first, regain life for the players is a solid character. Weapon and custome skins are a nice touch that doesn't do anything for game play but something small that adds interest. Very playable with just keyboard and mouse.Overall, a solid hack and slash.

												Well well well, I'm the First Templar and I don't know why... at least, until the End :)This game ha received too much negative critics but I'm not confident with critics, so I played It from the beginning to the end, included the special Steam exclusive mission! And it's funny! There are the templars and here they are well represented. The game focuses upon the historical reproduction of the epoc and you will find here a lot of original tables with rules and letters of the past. This means that you have to forgot magic, skeletons and other stuff, this is a game that wants to recreate the scenario of the ancient and it reaches in my opinion enough well. Graphics is detailed and clear, armor expecially are good, with bump mapping and reflection of the iron. Of course this is a budget game, and a lot of details that you find in colossus like skyrim and Co. are missing. The gameplay is focused on a single working trama that will discover the secret of the Templars, the use of the Inquisition as an army and will let you understand as a first protagonist how man race reaches it's worst during time.A part this, you will play an amusing action game with ""corridors"" level but some secrets here and there, with various scenario that reaches sometimes incredible skyline. I've get fun doing a lot of screenshots and they are really good. You will fight always with a companion that will help you expecially in your morale. You will never feel lost or abandoned because he/she will always be there! strange...Gameplay is alternate between action, exploring, tracking footsteps, or levels of traps and chests; there is also a stealth mode. Everything I must say, is very simplified, but is a good balance and it'is fun! Moreover you will gain experience to level up both your characters, but you will master the art of combat not so quickly because it's not simple to understand how to engage in the most proficient manner.The game is long? Yes! it is, I've taken about 16 hours to complete ... just remember to get fun from everything, looking scenario, reading tablets of original manuscripts of the epoc, and so on..This is a very good budget game, too high for budget and too low for colossus production... a midle budget funny game! Play it if you want some distraction between a shooter and an Rpg.Lord Hol Napult's experience: 7/10			"

												This game is very enjoyable as a multiplayer co-op RPG. My fiance and I have been playing through it together. Though it has its quirks (only the host can level up the characters, small bits of lag) it has been quite enjoyable for us. The story is passable (but it's no Mass Effect) and the combat is actually pretty fun. There are light/charge/secondary attacks as well as melee special abilities (crowd control and single-target options). Though there's nothing revolutionary here, there's also nothing bad. If you've got a friend and want a solid multiplayer RPG (light on the story), this is a great find for a few bucks.			"

												Very interesting experience. This game really really makes me ambivalent. In my head is only one question: Was it good game or not?+interesting story+good representation of time and historical events (outfits, armors, environment etc..)+good music+great atmosphere (beautiful music and environment)but-boring combat system (you need only two buttons to fight)-stupid stealth actions (unrealistic, and in some parts of the game you are forced to use stealth or you cannot pass mission)-sometimes ugly bugs let me complete side missions-i didn't like that big guys looks like a beast in the beginning (i think they don't belong to this story)My conclusion: This game is good experience for everyone who like stories from history or mysteries about Templar order. For these who goes only for gameplay this game is not so good purchase. But i enjoy it so i recommend.			"

												Well glad that was over, trying to go through each game and beat them no matter how bad they are... and this was one of those times I really wanted to put in in my endless backlog. The dialog was boring and bland, but the story was pretty okay.  Honestly just skip it, play assassins creed or one of the many other games like this. Some things that are annoying in this game---------------------------------------------The Traps --- Worst implementation in any game I have ever played The Combat --- HOLY TEMPLAR is it bad. Specially getting knocked down on the ground by gawd is that crap annoyingMusic --- Same thing over and over againCounters--- unimpressiveUnblockable attacks--- So annoying... cannot even counter themPostives -------------------Seige combat was fun kind of...

												How did someone look at this game and think it was okay? Kalypso has brought us some decent strategy games but this is an action game that seems to have the graphics and animations of a strategy game and that would seem okay but in this case, it just looks downright awful. This game is better than Cursed Crusade but that doesn't make this a good game. Another thing is that this game is not Teen, it is a few decals shy of an M rating, and I'm okay with this. It's the gameplay, the voice acting, and the stiff animations combining with sudden jumpy movements characters seem to have. It just doesn't work together to make a cohesive action experience. If you want a game about Templars and Crusaders, just stick to Assassin's Creed because while this game can entertain, it truly begins to grate on you like you are parmesan cheese over a bowl of pasta.+ Some decent gameplay+ Finishers are cool+ Tons of violence for a Teen rating+ Skill trees have a lot of room to make the characters suit your playstyle- Not a single interesting character- Dull combat- Animations are janky- Voice acting is atrocious- Graphics are poor- Uninteresting collectables- Hair looks like cement/clay- No physics in this game at all- Still a boring experience, even with a friend			"

												The First Templar. A very good medieval sword-fighting game. In the game, you are a templar trying to do what's right - to prevent the Holy Grail from falling into the wrong hands. During the game, you will encounter cries for help, revenge, savagery and betrayal.If you are playing solo, you will be accompanied by either one of two characters namely Roland and Marie. Both have merits in their own fighting style. The good news is, you can swap-play your companion if you are bored with the protagonist. However, I would suggest a real life co-op buddy if you are playing in Hard Mode. Your AI buddy aren't too bright for higher levels.Controls are simple. Gameplay above average. However, the only problem I found in this game is the game-saving format. Saving can only be made at checkpoints automatically and there's only one save slot. If you forgot, let's say to pick up an outfit, and the game goes to the next scene (which is also a checkpoint), you will never get the outfit unless you replay from the start of the chapter. Very annoying.Other than that, no visible problem for me at least. I have played it 4 times and finished them completely (for the achievements, what else...). If you like medieval sword-fighting games, this is for you!To me, this game scores a 78% satisfaction.			"
