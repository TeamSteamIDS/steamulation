 Fix has been found; woo! (Outdated review)This review is a tad obsoletepps: Some people are still reporting it not working. Idek at this point. Just be cautious.-WARNING/GAME HAS BEEN BROKEN-PLEASE UPVOTE THIS TO WARN OTHER PLAYERSThere is no point in buying this game anymore, it has been broken and Rockstar couldnt give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about it.You guys remember GFWL right?The pimple on your forehead that showed up out of nowhere and proclaimed 'YEAH GUYS PC GAMING IS THE BEST WOO AM I RITE?!' ?Well its dead now.Problem is rockstar refuses to patch this game.You can save games anymore because it asks for a GFWL login - but the servers are dead so you cant log in ergo you cant save.But what about multip-no.Thats dead too. GFWL took to its grave the chaos and hilarity that was gta iv multiplayer.My friend just bought this and got ripped off because he wasnt aware of this.Please save other gamers money.EDIT: There is a multiplayer-less workaround now. If you're fine throwing this much money for the single player experience go ahead.It seems quite inconsistent too; many are having this game just flat out not work, while for others it works perfectly.

												The best way to play this game is to ignore all outlets offering the product for purchase legitimately. Heres what you do. Close this page, go to google, and torrent it. The game does not work on newer systems without an amazingly complicated process of messing with some simple directories. The game is broken. If a game won't work legitimately, remove it from the market or patch the issue. If Rockstar thinks that we don't know how simple and cheap it would be to fix, then they're lying to themselves and deserve to lose sales to piracy. Simple as that. Pirate it, you'll have no problems. Pay to not play.			"

												To those with Games for Windows Live issues or who are whining that the game is broken and shouldn't be sold due to this: There is no issue. You simply have to create an offline account, which is clearly stated when you start the game. I have personally done this. I installed the game, created an offline account, completed the first mission and saved. I restarted the game and guess what? I started off from the saved point.To those whiners: Please take the time to confirm if a game is broken or not before writing some non-sense review to scare people off. Save yourself the embarrassment of being proven to be both wrong and ignorant.			"

												TL;DRHaving a legitimate copy of game was never so unfavorable. ♥♥♥♥ games for windows.On windows 8/10 run with parameters: -availablevidmem 60 -norestrictions -nomemrestrictSo where do I start first?When I tried launching the game nothing was happening, just icon flashing for a while on taskbar.Apparently I had to download myself GFWL from Microsoft website, which was not included in the game.Later I had to verify my game through Rockstar Social Club or something which didn't activate at first, but after several tries it worked.Game launched at 800x600 with everything on low, because game detected only 23MB of video ram.After some searching i had to modify a bit launching parameters (-nomemrestrict).Then when I finally got into game had to create an GFWL account to let me save my ♥♥♥♥ing progress in game (they don't store your progress on cloud, they just want you to log in for ""achievements"").Clicked play after sitting in front of loading screen for 5 minutes I realised something is wrong.After MORE research i had to modify again launch parameters to -availablevidmem 60 -norestrictions -nomemrestrict.Seriously, what the ♥♥♥♥ is that? You pay for a game that you need to tweak half an hour after searching some info on the internet? Why is this still on shop unpached without any information about it being unable to launch without this mess??The game itself is okay in my opinion, but they should pay more attention to games they still are selling.

												ALL GTA IV AND GTA IV EPISODES FROM LIBERTY CITY FIXES!!!This is a fix review for GTA IV and GTA IV Episodes From Liberty City, on whether you should buy these games.The short answer is NO! and here is why...First off, I loved the story of GTA IV and GTA IV Episodes From Liberty City, in my eyes I had just as much fun with them as any other GTA game. The reason why I am not recommending them however is because of the shear number of Port Issues these 2 games have.Now, I am going to tell you all the issues and how to fix them but even so, the reason I do NOT recommend them is because Rockstar have done nothing in years to fix these bugs and even beyond that the Online is completly broken and yet they do NOT specify this or any fixes on the Steam Page.1) FIRST BUG - Graphics Card- Ok so basically if you have a Graphics Card that has a video RAM of over 2GB, (I have a 4GB GTX 970 myself) both games do NOT allow you to adjust any of the graphics options!This is crazy and so surprised Rockstar have not fixed this :( But to do so, on Steam go to your Library, right click over either GTA IV game and then go to Set Launch Options and enter this without the brackets (-nomemrestrict -norestrictions). Once you ok that you can start up the game ane edit your graphics options like normal :)2) SECOND BUG - Game Not Starting- Ok so this is the biggest one and it seems to be happening a lot to people with Windows 10 like myself. So when you sign into the Rockstar Social Club it either says failed or password not correct (even when it is), something along those lines yeah. Well if you go to the hard drive on your computer where the game is stored and find either Steam>Steamapps>Common>(Then either GTA IV game) or Rockstar Games>(Then either GTA IV game) and find inside either folder these 3 files ""gtaencoder"",""gta4browser"",""gtaiv"" for Grand Theft Auto IV and these 3 files ""eflc"",""gta4browser"",""gtaencoder"" for Grand Theft Auto IV Episodes From Liberty City; then right click on every file and choose Properties>Compatibility and then choose Windows Vista Service Pack 2>Apply>Ok.Now that you have done those steps you should be able to launch the game, Rockstar Social Club pop up, choose Offline and the game actually start up :)3) THIRD BUG - Games For Windows Live- Well we can all agree that this has ruined games...lol!But basically in order for you to be able to sign in to LIVE, you need to go to go here...http://www.xbox.com/en-US/LIVE/PC/DownloadClient...and download this software and install it. You don't need to start it up, just so long as it is on your machine. Once you have done that you will be able to sign into LIVE via the game and start at least earning Achievements until Rockstar fix the Online.4) FOURTH BUG - Online Broken- Sadly at this stage I can't specify a fix for the Online as I have looked at many forums and Rockstar's Website :( I guess only time will tell, but if there is a fix in the future I will be sure to update this section here :)Cheers Guys, please pass on and share as I just want people to enjoy the games :)James.

 it is literally perfect. Episodes from Liberty City is more like a big expansion pack than ""DLC."" You get two completely new campaigns for an absurdly low price. Lots of new weapons, new vehicles, new helicopters, new cutscenes, new characters, and more explosive.Endless hours of entertainment with this game weather you choose to do missions, or just cause TERROR on the streets of Liberty City. Of course the more missions you complete, the more you're going to have options as far as weapons and newer exotic vehicles to steal. Software itself is well rendered and the modelling within the game is superb. Spectacular graphics with settings maxed out- well worth the upgrade of your video card if required.			"

""45 YEARS OLD AND I GET MY KICKS DOING BLOW WITH 17 YEAR OLD KIDS WHOSE ONLY CLAIM TO FAME IS THAT PEOPLE KNOW BETTER WHAT THEIR ♥♥♥♥♥♥ LOOKS LIKE THAN THEIR FACE. I SHOULD BE SENT TO PRISON, SHOULDN'T I?""Rockstar is one of those companies, whose DLC's and EXPANSIONS are really in right meaning of the word. If I don't mind, how they changed their DLC's policy in GTA V which by the time will step into regular EA bulls*it. Don't get me wrong, but Rockstar is starting to make stupid Cars/Skins/Weapons DLC's but at least for free, and I believe they'll fall into darkness of DLC gaming market model sooner or later. Back to the game.As I said before, oficially this game is expansion to GTA IV, but everyone who played it, raise the hands up for me, that this seems (and is) truly standard and actual game. Story is gripping and longer than stories of 90% nowadays games if not more. GTA IV, TBoGT (The Ballad of Gay Tony) and TLaD (The Lost and Damned) makes the universe. All three stories are connected with logical connection, and what happened in GTA IV has affect on these two stories (EFLC - Episodes From Liberty City). Or let's say it has affect on it. It's not like it has some real affect, but it was made to have the affect on it. And it has.Both expansions shows something of both worlds. TBoGT is showing classy high & luxurious style of life while TLaD is showing underground, real side of America. In overall I do like TBoGT more, but Johnny was truly awesome in TLaD.There's also one mission where all 3 characters meets up but now shhh about it. Same with intro. For the price you see at Store Page, you will get two precise full games not just expensions as they are called. Also they're BETTER OPTIMALIZED than GTA IV. So you don't have to worry about your hardware as much as you had to back then with IV.Bonus Point: Lenght & OptimalizationRating: 9/10(for both)			"

												--- The Lost and Damned ---I'd heard that TLAD was mediocre and paled in comparison to the base game and The Ballad of Gay Tony, but I actually liked it a lot more than the base game.+ Johnny handles motorcycles way better than Niko handles cars+ There aren't any really bad bikes (while most of the cars are terrible)+ You can get bikes for free and guns at a discount whenever you want by calling your gang members+ At the end of an early mission, the game tries to make you think it's gonna go all San Andreas and let your gang get pushed around by a couple of corrupt cops, but you just go kill them in the next mission+ You don't get called to go do things with your friends all the time+ This game introduces the sawn-off shotgun, which is the most hilariously overpowered gun to use on a motorcycle+ Also introduces a few more guns that are more interesting than anything in GTA IV: An automatic pistol, a street sweeper shotgun and a grenade launcher+ I enjoy playing as bikers in games and Johnny has a sweet jacket/ The story is still generally joyless/ The story is short, but there are a lot of side jobs, gang wars and races to do as well/ Johnny flipping his♥♥♥♥♥♥in combat for little reason can be alternately hilarious and annoying. ""F*** YOU! F*** YOU! F*** YOU F*** YOU F*** YOU F*** YOU!"" (this is all one line)- Only 2 safehouses, both very close together, and you can only use one or the other for most of the plot- Johnny runs slower than Niko and Luis if he's holding a weapon- The bike handling is still iffy, and the 4-wheeled vehicle handling is iffy at best- The death metal station has like 8 songs on it so if you listen to it a lot it will repeat all the time- No character customizationTLAD is still no San Andreas or Vice City but it's a pretty good game.

												Episodes from Liberty City puts you in the shoes of other people trying to make something of themselves in this world. Unlike Niko however, Luis and Johnny have been in this city for a long time; they know what's going on.Episodes from Liberty City brings you two stories, the story of Luis, The Ballad of Gay Tony, pretty self explanatory. And Johnny's story, one of the bikers in the Lost and Damned.In my opinion, Episodes from Liberty City is a much stronger and touching story; even though it does not contain as much sad parts and engaging as Niko's storyline. Sometimes sad stories are not a free pass for a good story.It depends on one's perspective, but to me, GTA 4 and all three of its main storyline, is based on a $2,000,000 worth of diamond(s), and the game just puts you in the shoes of one of the people who are chasing after this diamond. The moral of the story is, we all have a dream, but someone already owns that dream. Sometimes there's people with the exact same dream as you, they're also chasing it. And if you don't make friends with them, bad things are going to happen. In the end, no one achieves that dream, because we all killed each other; but in the end, that dream is given to those who deserve it. And a new chapter of the book begins....			"

												I love GTA IV, so I should probably recommend this. However, after a few hours it has become obvious that this game was never meant to be played.First the game ran fine. On the lowest graphics. I'm not allowed to change graphical settings. With some launch codes, I can! High graphics! Now the game crashes on start-up. Re-install game. Still crashing. Check the time. Yes, this game is still 4 years old. I consult Rockstar Support. They suck. So I google for a while and discover that Games For Windows Live is the problem. Reinstall that. Game runs! ""Please login to GFWL"" Okay. Okay... OKAY. Can't login to Games For Windows Live, because why the ♥♥♥♥ not? Uninstall, not recommending. It's been four years and we still have to deal with this kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. GTA V is almost here. We must hold on.			"

												Copy-pasted from my IV review. This is a review of both GTA IV and EFLC.Honestly one of the best games I have ever played. Compared to V, I think there are some things that IV does better, euphoria physics, vehicle handling, story, realism in general; It's nice if that's the kind of thing you're looking for. V improved in certain areas, and included a lot of things that IV was lacking. I don't think either is better than the other, but I personally prefer IV. The game runs OK, specs:Intel Core i5-3570 3.40GHz8gb RAMAMD HD 7950 (OC)I did some tweaking and I feel like it runs best at these settings:1680x1050 60 Hz (Native)Texture Quality: HighReflection Resolution: Very HighWater Quality: Very HighShadow Quality: HighNight Shadows: OffTexture Filter: Anisotropic x8View Distance: 25Detail Distance: 40Vehicle Density: 100Definition: OffVSync: OffFraps Benchmark: 5 minutes, 21682 framesMin: 47, Max: 102, Avg: 72.23I have the latest patches on both games. Everything is vanilla except for the Visual IV Mod. If you don't have it, you might as well install it. It makes the game look a lot better and apparently includes a ""fixed rendering code"" to make playing smoother.I run EFLC on the same settings and results were pretty much identical. Everyone is aware that GTA IV is a ♥♥♥♥ port, but I think I've managed to get a somewhat consistent framerate. It still drops to >30 for a few seconds, occasionally. This happens no matter what I do. It's still completely playable and doesn't annoy me at all, but it's something I noticed; It's still miles ahead of the console version. If anyone is able to get a constant 60+ in this game, let me know what you are doing. R* Social club isn't a big deal. GFWL is useless and I don't like it, but it hasn't caused me any trouble so far. Over all, my experience with this game has been really good. The only thing that would make it better is if multiplayer wasn't dead, would've made a nice mod-friendly alternative to GTA: Online.Edit:I felt inclined to update this review after finding out a little more about the graphics settings for this game. GTA IV is not necessarily meant to be maxed out on current hardware, the intention of the developers was that the higher graphical settings would be for future use, and when GTA IV was released on PC back in 2008 there was a disclaimer of some sort that advised players to use medium settings. I'm just learning this now and I had purchased GTA IV in 2012. People are criticizing the game for being a terrible port and having framerate issues because they believe they should be able to max out a 7 year old game. In most cases they would not be wrong in assuming that, but gta iv does have higher minimum requirements than pretty much any other game. Now, with current patches, as long as you have this game configured correctly it will run beautifully.AUTO CONFIGURE IS YOUR FRIEND.Use it when you are tweaking your graphics. If you have a decent rig, most of the settings will be automatically set to high/very high, except for VD, DD, and Vehicle Density. If you want to push it further, I would increase the vehicle density, which has the lowest impact on framerate, and you will be all right leaving everything else alone. Hope this helps anyone thats having trouble running this game.			"

The Lost and DamnedThis episode focuses on motorcycles, as you would expect from a game that revolves around a biker gang. If GTA4 wasn't gritty enough for you, this one's even grittier. Storywise, it's about the same level of grittiness as GTA4, if not more, If you like riding bikes, you'll like this episode; Johnny Klebitz has mastered the delicate art of not flying off his bike when clipping a lamp post at 20 miles an hour. Though he's not as good of a driver as Niko, and you'll definitely notice that if and when you get behind the wheel. There's more content in general, including an exclusive set of weapons to play with, including an autopistol, a sawed-off shotgun, and a grenade launcher. You get all three of these pretty damn early in the game; the sawed-off is Johnny's starter weapon and he can fire it while riding! Worth playing if you want to follow a parallel, equally if not more gritty story to Niko's.Lost MC! Lost MC!The Ballad of Gay TonyThis episode takes a leap away from GTA4's usual brand of grittiness; it's more colorful, has lots of new fun guns to play with (P90 SMG, advanced sniper rifle, M249 light machine gun, AA-12 shotgun with explosive rounds...), parachutes, upgraded police units, and a whackier tone to compete with its new nemesis, Saints Row 2. This one focuses a bit more on helicopters, so this episode may be good practice for the awful PC controls for the helicopters. Or it may frustrate you a bit. Once you finish the story, you can go back and replay any mission you want. There's a score system for missions this time around, but who cares? I actually find this episode to be more fun than GTA4 just because of all the fun stuff it adds. There's nothing like screwing up everyone's commute in Star Junction with stickybombs and an explosive shotgun. What's that? The police are coming? Pfft. They ain't got♥♥♥♥♥♥on my APC.You'll have a good time. And as always, mods only increase the fun.			"

												A MUST have addition to GTA IV. It basically retells the story of Libertiy City on the same time era as NIko from additional two different perspectives. A lot of events and mission end up tying between the three protagonists (Niko, Johnny, and Luis).The Lost and Damned (TLaD)Summary: American 60's biker drama (greasers, junkie girlfriend, running with the politic and mafia, pushers, internal dispute, etc.) There are lot of interesting gameplay mechanics introduced since you are now in bike club. Eg: You get to roll with your brothers (that's what they call each other); with each successful mission (and them not dying), they will receive 'EXP' to upgrade their survivability and weaponry. (Note: noobs brother tend to die easily, but main story brothers won't die unless the story tells so) The Ballad of Gay Tony (TBoGT)Spoiler: Actually not gay. Lots of booty calls (note: NOT from dudes). Dude who you are working for (Tony Prince, AKA Gay Tony) is the one who's gay; dude runs clubs in town with some 'business' partners. I played TBoGT a long time ago; frankly I don't remember any new interesting things thrown in except for booty calls. I do recall sweet♥♥♥♥♥helicopter (an upgrade from Annihilator) from rich♥♥♥♥♥racist Arab. You can replay missions though since each mission has this 'additional objectives' in order for you to get the 100%/ gold medal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and make yourself feel less terrible.Pros:+ Don't need to own GTA IV (But highly recommended to finish the main game first; this game assumes player has experienced base game. A lot of references are thrown here and there as story progresses)+ A lot of new arsenals introduced. They are exclusive to each stories (and are more OP in some cases)+ Complete different atmospheres with some new mechanics+ Feels more optimised than the base gameCons:- Takes another 16 GB of files even if you own GTA IV (since Episodes from Liberty City is considered a separate game). It is such a waste of space, considering 90% of the game files are recycled- Generic missions, with some minor bugs here and there- They RIP APART Vladivostok FM into pop dance club ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t FM. GIVE ME BACK Кино́'s Группа крови!Overall, if you or your friends are thinking of picking up GTA IV, get the Episodes from LIberty City as well.			"

												Episodes from Liberty city is like DLC for other games, but in this case you dont need own base game (GTA IV).So in this 'DLC' you have two short storylines to play with:The Ballad of Gay Tony:+Great story and funny characters++Overlaping sides of story and characters from main GTA and The Lost stories +A lot of fun in Story line for 7-8 hours+More diversity in gameplay+Colorfull gameplay++Awesome carpark+Cool guns+Better soundtrack for most radio stations- Too many ♥♥♥♥ing choppers :DThe Lost and Damned++Overlaping sides of story and characters from main GTA and Gay Tonny stories+A lot of fun for 5 hours+Awesome storyline+Fun new weapons+Better soundtrack for most radio stations, especially Liberty Rock-I dont like bikes, neither driving with them-Broken TV graphical theme in first person-Small amount of cars on streetsOverall very awesome  'DLC', overlaping characters and story lines was THE thing - everything about that 'ice'. :D			"

												In Episodes From Liberty City (EFLC), we play as 2 of the characters that cross paths with Niko Bellic and each other a  few times during Niko's story and learn mode details about the diamonds, secondary characters, and the city itself.All the pros and cons of Vanilla GTA IV apply to the expansions as well, so I'll only mention the differences.JUST LIKE THE VANILLA GTA IV, THE X.LIVE.LESS MOD IS ALMOST OBLIGATORY TO REMOVE GFLW, AND BE ABLE TO PLAY IT LIKE IT SHOULD BE PLAYEDThe Lost and DamnedWe play as Johnny Klebitz, the vice president of The Lost Motorcycle Club, as the Club struggles to stay dominant and alive in the gang wars of LC+ Improved motorcycle handling, now it's harder to fall off the bike (Sometimes unrealistically harder)+ New vehicles added (Mostly bikes)+ Darker tone and very interesting story+ New locations and activities, mostly MC related+ New weapons,also fitting the MC theme ( and the ability to use more weapons while riding, like the baseball bat and the sawed off shotgun)+ New songs and new TV/radio shows (Even more rock!)- Lack of more safehouses- No character customization- The new vehicles, locations, and weapons are not accessible on the vanilla GTA IVThe Ballad of Gay TonyWe play as Luiz Lopez, a security guard, and friend of Gay tony, a very rich nightclub owner.+ Get to experience the more ""glamorous"" side of Liberty City+ More Vehicles added (mostly luxury, also we get an attack helicopter and an APC)+ Parachuting is back!+ Very fun missions (If you liked those more over-the-top missions from previous games, You'll like the ones here)+ New activities and locations, mostly nightclub related+ New TV/Radio shows, songs and a new radio station (80's!) - Only one safehouse- The new vehicles, locations, and weapons are not accessible on the vanilla GTA IVThis is one of the best expansion packs I've ever seen, it has a lot of content and is completely stand-alone from the main GTA IVThis is how DLC should me made, this is a must have if you liked GTA IV			"

												Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City is an expansion pass for GTA 4 where you have to DLC packs which both expand on the story of GTA 4. I will review both as separate games so let's get into it.Grand Theft Auto Lost and Damned:This expansion pass follows on the biker gang Lost and Damned who are old school gang in Liberty City. The story follows on Johny Klebitz as he tries his best to keep his chapter under falling out.This expansion is really good, for story, but not so much for missions. Now I know that I should have expected this, from an expansion that follows on Bikers, but I didn't really like how much of the entire expansion follows on bike rides. But the story missions were fun and challenging.Music wise I enjoyed the rock music in this game, it's a very fitting choice of music for this expansion and it works well.The entire expansion overall is still better than the entirety of GTA 4, I enjoyed the story and action based missions, but hated all the bike stuff, because of how bikes control in GTA 4 overall.Next up is Grand Theft Auto The Ballad of Gay Tony:This expansion is better than Lost and Damned and GTA 4.This expansion follows on Luis a bodyguard who works on a business man Gay Tony. The entire expansion takes place after the Three Leaf Clover mission in GTA 4 and is all about Luis trying to save Tony's dying business by taking up different business ventures.This expansion is incredibly fun and I had tons of fun playing through it. A lot of the missions are really fun action packed missions and it fixes a lot of the problems that Lost and Damned and GTA 4 had.The overall atmosphere is also not as dark and lightens the tone. It's also incredibly funny, the characters are funny and it's all really fun. Lightening the tone also helps a lot, cause GTA 4 being way too serious made the game kind of boring to play. This expansion also paves the way to GTA 5 like the medals in missions and multiple characters.Overall this expansion is a great addition and is overall better than the main game, but I still suggest playing all three games.Pros:+ Funny and cleverly written stories+ Missions are action packed so it never gets boring to play+ Soundtracks which fit the overall atmosphere of the expansionsCons:- Gameplay and Car physics aren't that good- Gun gameplay is incredibly stiffFinal Rating:9/10			"

												A relatively short yet interesting expansion of the original GTA IV, this pack actually comprises of 2 storyline games, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, in which you can either play as the biker Johnny Klebitz, or the prestigious Luis Fernando Lopez, respectively.While EFLC is much shorter than the original game, it still shows Liberty City from two completely different perspectives, with one of them being the lifestyle of bikers (bikes, booze, drugs, rock 'n' roll and babes) and the other being the modern, night club lifestyle (fancy sports cars, dancing, pop, booze and babes too).The only cons of the PC version are the inclusion of the obsolete Windows gaming services, which are completely useless and even at times disrupting for the players, and the poor job with the port, which requires you to own a beefy PC to play it on higher settings.Overall, it's a damn fine expansion and I completely recommend it if you're a fan of open world and third person shooter games.

												As I write this, the release date for GTA V is fast approaching. Hard to believe it's been 5 years since GTA4 was released.GTA: Episodes from Liberty City (EFLC) moves the base GTA4 game forward nicely. There's two smaller storylines, each about 12-16 hours of gameplay. Both stories are interwoven with the main GTA4 storyline. Niko Bellic and other characters make appearances in these games, and certain loose ends are tied up in these episodes.The stories are strong, the supporting characters are interesting, and the protagonists are fun to play. Luis Lopez, the main character in The Ballad of Gay Tony, is my new favorite GTA protagonist - even better than Vice City's Tommy Vercetti. These two smaller games are much more interesting to me than Niko Bellic's story.EFLC delivers some technical fixes and gameplay improvements to the base game.  Most notably, we now have mid-mission checkpoints, so if you fail a mission, you can pick up part-way through. This really decreases the frustration level of the game. Less notably, but important to me: traffic is more realistic. And, motorcycles are easier to control.The Ballad of Gay Tony is the standout episode. It brings back the over-the-top flavor of Vice City and San Andreas. The missions are crazy fun, including a shootout on top of the Empire State Building, hijacking a subway car, helicopter duels, and a race around Manhattan -- excuse me, ""Algonquin"" -- involving parachutes, speedboats and fast cars. There's a new cage-fighting mini-game, and everywhere you turn in this one, there's fast cars to boost. And, as mentioned, parachuting! There's 20 optional missions involving base jumping and parachuting skills. Excellent fun. The Ballad of Gay Tony pulls out all the stops to show off what this game engine is capable of delivering. And maybe, hopefully, it shows that Rockstar hasn't forgotten how to have fun. If you need a GTA fix before GTA V appears and you skipped these episodes, you should definitely take a second look.  "

												Overall a great game, got it working on Windows 10 too.Last time I played was in Windows 7 and it worked fine, but getting it working in Windows 10 was kind of a pain. I could always play it in Windows 7 by putting GFWL on offline mode, but this time there doesn't seem to be an offline option.First of all, install ""Games For Windows Marketplace"" (google it, should be the first result, xbox.com page), set up an account if you don't have one. The game may automatically direct you to the download link upon trying to launch it for the first time, it did for me. You may get a prompt from Windows 10 that it's not compatible, but install it anyway. Without Games For Windows Live/Marketplace installed, the game won't launch at all.Make sure you put ""-nomemrestrict -norestrictions"" (without quotes of course) in the game's launch options (right click it in Steam library, select Properties). If you don't, the game won't let you change resolution or any graphics settings.From the main menu, pick the LIVE option and sign in. It may take a while, maybe not, but just be patient if it seems to take a while. At some point it will also ask for your game key. Don't try to close the GFWL overlay in the game while it's signing in either, I did and the whole thing became unresponsive.It may ask you to update GFWL, I updated but it may not be necessary. If you choose to update, it will ask you to exit and re-launch the game, just sign in again from the main menu using the LIVE option. When I tried to sign in when prompted while starting a new game, it crashed. So using the LIVE option from the main menu was necessary for me. It will also download your ""Profile"" this may also take a bit, again just be patient.Once you're signed into LIVE go ahead and start a new game, it should work without any problems.It's been a while since I played this game and it was a pain to get it working this time, but so far it was worth it. I almost gave up at one point, was gonna chalk it up to the game being incompatible with Windows 10. It actually works fine under Windows 10, it's just this Games For Windows Live/Marketplace stuff that gets in the way.TL;DRTo get EFLC working in Windows 10:1) Install Games For Windows Marketplace, sign up for an account if you don't have one.2) Put ""-nomemrestrict -norestrictions"" (without quotes) in launch options for game.3) Launch game, set up graphics, sign into GFWL using the ""LIVE"" option in the main menu. It may take a while, be patient. It may ask for the game key, just put it in and it will work.4) Start a new game.			"

												This is pretty much GTA IV on steroids. TLaD expands the base game a bit, especially by adding many new bikes.TBoGT feels like a true evolution (something like Vice City compared to GTA III). There is a quite significant amount of new vehicles (which reappear in GTA V), fun weapons and other minor details, like base jumping. The majority of missions involves doing rather crazy stuff, especially in comparison to the base game. In fact, to me it felt like a bridge between GTA IV and V.The only thing I didn't really like was the fact that GTA IV's campaign was longer. The EFLC's ones are rather short, despite the existence of repetetive side missions.Still, fun-wise, TBoGT is the greatest thing since San Andreas (I'm not counting GTA V because I haven't played it yet).

												Beware of buying GTA 4 and GTA Episodes Of Liberty City.They do not run correctly. I've tried all the commandline fixes and made an account with Rockstar Social Club like one user mentioned. The game runs like poop. Even though I am getting 46fps. Theres texture pop ins and it's not smooth at all, just massive nasty lag. If I turn off vsync there is massive screen tearing. Thousands of users have problems with these games just by browsing the many message boards of the internet on possible fixes. I really want my money back to ,but I don't see any customer support section for steam. These games were a total rip off and they should not be sold.system specs?AMD 965 black edition 3.7GHZCorsair Vengeance 16GB running at 1600mhz750 watt Thermaltake EVO power supply256 Gb Crucial SSD M550 with speeds of 500mb Read and 450mb writeGTX 660 TI 2GBThere is a file called contig that you can get which is a defragmenter meant to defragment a specific set of files for GTA which in turn makes it run like butter. But, as you can see I have a solid state drive and I'm not about to break it for this aweful game. Which in fact did work better when I had a HD 4890 1GB and the game was not on steam. Worked well except it would crash my pc if the settings were not just right. Now it's just total garbage. How can steam sell this crap? Don't they have a reputation to uphold?			"

												Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City*In this review, I'll be covering TLaD and TBoGTStory (TBoGT) - I loved it, full of action. Last mission was really cool. But some missions could be better. 9/10Story (TLaD) - It was alright, it had many awesome moments, but at the same time the game felt really dark. 8/10Storyline Length (TBoGT) - Around 3 hours or so. Maybe a bit more.Storyline Length (TLaD) - Again, around 3 hours or so, or even more.AI (Both games) - Just like in GTA IV, easy to kill, fun to interact with. with your car. Just, brilliant. But they are a tiny bit stupid. 9/10Experience (TBoGT) - You'll have an amazing time playing this! Great intro, great ending, great freemode. 10/10Experience (TLaD) - It's a bit dark, but fun. It had an ok intro, brilliant and satisfying ending, good freemode. 8/10Graphics (TBoGT) - Very nice and full of colour. Very detailed. Loved it. 10/10Graphics (TLaD) - I'd say it had more detail than TBoGT, but it certainly lacked the colour that TBoGT and GTA IV had. I'm not saying it's black and white, it just doesn't have as much colour. Like, the sky is almost always cloudy, the yellow taxis aren't AS yellow. But it's still ok. 7/10Sounds / Voice Acting (TBoGT) - Very nice, the voice acting was brilliant, the car sounds were good, many different radio stations for different radio types. My favourite is Electro Choc. Gun sounds are quite good aswell. 10/10Sounds / Voice Acting (TLaD) - Just like TBoGT, voice acting is great, bike sounds are good, a lot of radio stations, and I think there are other guns which have awesome sounds. 10/10Controls (Both games) - Takes a while to get used to the helicopter, but everything else is just great! 10/10Overall (TBoGT) - 10/10Overall (TLaD) - 9/10These are great games, and I recommend you try it if you haven't already! Isn't much to say here, as I said everything up there. Erm... Enjoy the game, I guess xD			"

												Once upon a time, there was a brave thief who decided to buy a new dagger. That dagger looked good, was $7, and came in a bundle of 3 daggers for the price of one. The thief bought and opened the bundle and found that the daggers needed to be blessed since it was cursed. Games for Windows Live cursed those daggers and the thief thought of giving up since the creator of these daggers left no cure. Then he came across a blacksmith who looked promising and asked ""How do I remove the curse on these daggers?"" The blacksmith looked at the thief with a smile on her face and said "" Here, use this water. It's called X_Liveless. It should allow you to use those daggers after you placed the water on them."" The thief did as the blacksmith said to do. Several minutes later, the thief was able to wield any of the three daggers. Legend says that he who conquers the curse would be able to enjoy the use of weapons. Simply said, Rockstar should have cleaned GTA IV complete edition for Steam to sell. Don't get me wrong, I like the game. It's just that Rockstar should have made a patch, so Steam could take over instead of Games for Windows Live.			"

												DLC-pack for GTA IV with two separate stories : The lost and the Damned - The ballad of Gay Tony. Looking at the play time....is it a DLC ?Installation : unlike with GTA III, Liberty City, San Andreas and GTA IV, installation went smoothly.However, do install GFWL (recent version) yourself.It's a stand-alone pack so no need to have GTA IV installed.Save games : If you have GTA IV installed be aware that the DLC is using the same standard save-game directory as GTA IV and overwrites the GTA IV save games.Story-line : It has references / connections / cameo's of GTA IV characters so best to play GTA IV first.Game quality : simply a top game just like....GTA IV (story-line, characters, graphs, sound, music, humor), what a vibrant lively open world.Maps : same as in GTA IV so Liberty City with Alderney, Broker and AlgonquinBugs : nopeEnd credits of both missions : don't skip them.....contains some fun to watch drone video views about ingame missions like the bank robbery.LOST AND THE DAMNED (LD)Main story : clash of two biker gangs (The lost and the Damned versus The angels of Death) and the internal rival between the members of the LD.Side missions :Races (12) : located across Liberty City, driving a motor bike is challenging and needs some excercise. Equipped with a baseball bat, you can knock other racers from their bike and vice versa.   -> Fun to do and more challenging then the car races in GTAIVGang Wars (25) : located across Liberty City, find and kill all gang members (The angels of Death members or Russians) at a certain map location. Difficulty increases by taking on more missions. You have help from NPC club bike members but don't rely on them........their AI is not that smart. What to think about a gang member throwing a grenade at me or stepping in my line of fire. -> So so, generic missionsBike Thefts (10) : steal bikes and bring them back to your gang club for money-> So so, easy missionsRandom Characters (3) and  their short stories : are displayed on the map with a white icon.-> Fun to doSeagulls (50) : find and kill the sea gulls (no icons on the map)-> Boring brainless excercise, skipped that one. Without a walktrough, it will takeages to find them.Something else : two new standup comedian shows, the mini games 'air hockey' and 'arm wrestling', new radio stations (heavy metal and rock)BALLAD OF GAY TONY (BT) :Main story : You are the bodyguard Vince of Gay Tony, owner of two discotheques and he is in serious debts with the mafia. Did you like :* Brucie in GTA IV, well then you never met his brother Mori* Roman in GTA IV, well it can get worse, meet Arab money Yusuf Amir, loser number one* CJ in GTA San Andreas, you will be playing Vince escaped his hood but sometimes catches up with his homies Henrique and Armando to go on drug  wars* Gay Bernie Crane in GTA IV, please to meet Gay Tony and his coke head lover boy EvanSide missions :Races (3) : A combination of paragliding, steering a speed boat and driving a car-> Fun to doRandom mission (5) : Funny and hilarious encounters, simply enjoyableSeagulls (50) : As in LD, skipped it, pfff, impossible to find them all without help.......Drug wars (25) : Steal the drugs from another gang, drive to the place, kill everyone together with your friends Henrique and Armando, pick up the drugs package, get in a vehicle and drive back to the offload point in car or boat chase style -> so, so  generic missionsBase jumping (15) : Jump from a helicopter or building and paraglide through air checkpoints and land on a ground target or paraglide directly on to a fixed or moving target (boat / truck). Do it the Assassin's creed away -> fun to do.Cage Fighting : Win six rounds, each consisting of three battles against (un)armed opponentsSomething else : doing some surveillance in the discotheque, champagne drinking contest, dancing with the lllladieezzz, drinking shots and going out with friends..

												Might as well make it detailed.Grand Theft Auto: Episodes From Liberty City is bugged, hacked and modded, and it will ALWAYS stay like that. You can't go in a server without getting missing textures, spammed by bullets and explosives, and get modded and crash. The community for EFLC got screwed up, the servers are filled with people with carmods, people fighting cops, people killing each other for no actual reason (in Free Mode, not Deathmatch), and of course, good ol' crashers. If you want to buy it for Multiplayer, get Multi Theft Auto for San Andreas or wait for GTA V PC.Single player, both of the stories are good, but very short, it feels like the game ended really quickly. So if you like GTA because of it's stories, This might not be what you want.So, The game is short, Multiplayer becomes annoying when you see your damn desktop every five minutes, bugs everywhere... Rockstar needs to fix the game (Spoiler Alert: They won't), so, if you buy this game, you should know you'll experience a short story, crashing, and A LOT of rage in Multiplayer.			"

It's like playing GTA 4.5. Both episodes provide more backstory on events in GTA 4. The Ballad Of Gay Tony is my favorite with its over the top action missions involving boats, tanks, and chopters. You can also replaying any of the missions once the story is complete, a new feature of GTA-series that will make it into GTA 5. Overall a really solid game, get it now.			"

												Liberty City is a one crazy, messed up place with lots of opportunities. EFLC gives GTA IV a revisit in 2 other protagonists' perspective. The characters you play with really distinguish themselves from their peers and they people they work with.While this game is not a big step up from IV, it backs itself up well for being a standalone game (and not a mere DLC). Multiple additions to cars, guns, and recreational activities are just part of the game's added value.Here are the things I liked and disliked about each episode:TLaD+ Biker life - gang wars, hot bikes, gambling, club+ New guns (imagine shooting a sawed-off while riding on a motorcycle)+ New bikes (of course!)- No territorial progression (raiding rival clubhouses and owning them, etc.)- Not enough biker gangs (you have 1 archrival)- Your biker members are all idiots (the AI sucks)- No dating life; lasting relationships purely within the brotherhoodBoGT+ Nightlife and everything nice - clubbing, gay clubs, golden helicopters, golden guns+ New cars (and some of them, fancy!)+ Base jumping+ Gay Tony and Yusuf Amir+ Finally, a tank! (you use it in only 1 mission)- Handling of some cars is a little annoying- Hookups only, dating life nonexistentHere are some of the things I expected, but didn't get, in the game:- Stealth ops (more disguises, suppressed guns)- Winter season (it snows in NY, right?)- The military chasing you at 6 stars- Smarter drivers - they randomly change lanes, do not use their turn lights before doing so. This was a problem in GTA IV that I hoped they were able to solve. I can't believe how many times I failed a mission because of an idiot that decided to change lanes in front of me.			"

												EFLC has new features that GTA IV doesn't have like parachuting, motorcycle racing, gang wars and  new weapons, vehicles and places to visit like nightclubs. The characters in EFLC are interesting. The game is a great complement to the GTA IV story. Though you need to run it with Game for Windows Live which is very annoying and quite difficult to setup. You'll need to tweak the game in order to run it on Windows 8.1 but it works fine on Windows 7.			"

												GTA: Episodes from Liberty City is an expandalone (Standalone Expansion Pack) of GTA IV. They are a two-in-one game, with two sides of one story.On one hand you have The Lost biker gang having gang and family issues, and on the other hand you are Luis Lopez, a part-time bodyguard at Maisonette 9, one of the biggest nightclubs in Liberty City.I will be covering The Ballad of Gay Tony first, as I found it most enjoyable.TBoGT has the most enjoyable missions in any GTA game ever, in my opinion. They are all action packed, interesting and never some sort of escort mission, or ""drive there and come back"" type of mission. If you've ever played GTA:SA then think of the mission where you board the cargo plane, ""Stowaway"". Now, multiply that mission about 30 times and you have TBoGT in a nutshell.You get to own interesting and very fun weapons and vehicles such as huge capacity machineguns and... actually I won't spoil any more, I will just say that you will have fun, GUARANTEED, if you have one of those weapons equipped, or you are driving/piloting any of the special, new vehicles. Most of the new vehicles, if not all of them have been copy and pasted into GTA V, as they were too much fun!The story of TBoGT is a bit lacking, but it's enough there to keep you going. The characters in the story, though, are the most crazy and insane in any GTA game ever! There is not one main story cutscene that doesn't involve someone really high on drugs, half-naked or drunk as♥♥♥♥♥♥ You just can't hold in a laugh every time a cutscene rolls!Buuut, here comes the sad and disappointing part of the pack... The Lost and Damned.Now, this might be a bit of a swayed opinion, but The Lost and Damned was just too boring for me. The first initial missions involve you riding with your gang, informing the player about who is who. The leader of the gang just got out of jail and you are picking up his custom bike from the shop. That's the intro, really, and it's a boring, long intro of just driving. The dialogue kinda made up for it, as it was semi-interesting. It is nice to hear the bikers talk to each other when they are in proximity.You still get some extra weapons that you don't get to use in TBoGT, and even some vehicles, but nothing really stands out. There's a sawed-off double barrel shotgun that is incredibly useful at knocking off enemy bikers, as it only needs one pellet to do so, but it's inaccurate as hell and requires you to be at point blank range. I find melee to be more fun at that time. TBoGT has set the bar for that sort of stuff, and TLaD is nowhere near reaching it.If you really enjoyed GTA IV's narrative and atmosphere, you might enjoy TLaD because it is much more slow and story-driven.In the end, it's weird that it was packaged with a much more ""mindless fun"" type of game as TBoGT.I will rate both parts of the expansions separately, but the game is so cheap now you might as well just buy it for one and have the other as a sort of nice bonus.TLaD: 5/10 - Generally boring, uninteresting, but has its good bits, and come on it's still a GTA game!TBoGT: 9/10 - Definitely takes the cake as it never gets boring until the end of the story.(I have not touched upon the technical issues such as GFWL and such, but there is a mod called x_live_less (remove ""_"", Steam censors the name for some reason) that removes GFWL and may help you with any issues. I managed to play the game start to finish with GFWL installed and updated no problem, but this may be different for you. Keep in mind Steam refunds are a thing, and do not let this sway you from the purchase of this amazing expandalone!)			"

												Best DLC a video game ever had.If you are through the main story of GTA IV, this is a great opportunity to play as two other heroes of Liberty City. Some missions are even harder than those in the original game. Of course, it had the Rockstar Social Club with a partially bugged login, and also has Games for Windows Live, but once you've logged in to it, you will be able to feel the real Liberty City energy once again.

												Both of these games are really fun, each narrative has it's advantages and disadvantages, and each one has it's own set of vehicles, characters, cameos and easter eggs. They are both fun 10 hour expansions to the game however I would recommend this soully for the Ballad of Gay Tony DLC.The vehicles and missions are more interesting, there are better side missions and recurring jobs and multiplayer is so much better on account of the cars. The ballad of gay tony has excellent replayability, and is generally hella good fun. The one bad point is even on modern hardware these games are really damn unoptimised on modern hardware and there is nothing we can do about that. On a decent rig expect 60 fps but no more. Even after 8 years however the graphics on these games are stunning.			"

Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City is a third-person open-world adventure shooter. Play either as Johnny Klebitz, the VP of The Lost biker club, or Luis Fernando Lopez, henchman of Gay Tony, as you strive through the criminal underworld of Liberty City.Pros: This is two full campaigns for Grand Theft Auto IV but doesn't require the original game to run. These are characters that crossed Niko Bellic's path in the original campaign, but their stories happen in parallel to it, allowing you to see who they were, deal with their troubles on their end, giving you a chance to understand events that happened behind the curtains of crimes Niko was involved in. Both are full-fledged story lines of their own, with its own lot of unique characters you come across and gameplay elements. Your new friends brings new perks of their own, and new locations.Cons: You don't have the same feeling of discovery in this game as it's the one as Grand Theft Auto IV, with some locations or stores no longer available. You have a lot less mini-games and side quests, and much if the character customization is gone. There is no major change to the city.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youIt's more of the same, so it's all up to you. If you didn't enjoy Grand Theft Auto IV that much, there is no reason to buy this. However, if you did like GTA4 and wished you could play more campaign mode in Liberty City, these will deliver!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												A fantastic expansion for GTA4. GTA4 on its own is already a great game, but it was lacking some of the older GTA things that made the series fun. The added some of that into this stand alone expansion pack. The story on both episodes is pretty solid and the missions are fun. The better of the 2 is The Ballad of Gay Tony. It is arguably better than GTA4 in all areas. The missions are more diverse and they even add some of the older GTA missions, for example there is a mission where you get to skydive. These episodes are on sale all the time so I hightly recommend them, I give these episodes a 9/10, lots of extra GTA fun.			"

												Grand Theft Auto: Episode from Liberty City is an Action/Adventure/Open-World game that contains the 2 DLC of Grand Theft Auto IV: The Ballad of Gay Tony and The Lost and Damned. The Ballad of Gay Tony follows the story of the protagonist: Luis Lopez who is the henchman of Gay Tony in a difficult time for the U.S. economy. The Lost and Damned follows the story of the protagonist: Johnny Klebitz who is the Vice-President of the motorcycle club: The Lost. Now let's talk about the multiplayer! The multiplayer of the TLAD is completly dead. If you want to have fun in multiplayer in EFLC, TBOGT is consider as the best multilayer of all the GTA IV games. To play multiplayer you will need: Xbox Live Account (Gold is not required) and a Rockstar Game Social Club Account. For more fun you will need: Simple Native Trainer 6.5 (link below) and ASI loader. Hope this review will help you to make a choice!Links: RGSC: http://socialclub.rockstargames.com/Register to Xbox Live: Xbox.comSimple Native Trainer 6.5: http://www.gta4-mods.com/script/simple-trainer-version-65-f2115ASI Loader: http://www.gta4-mods.com/tools/gta-iv-asi-loader-v1020b-f1976 "

												WOW, What a game(s) both being the same but different gameplay mechanics implemented, felt really different of each one.I started with TBOGT, I hated it when the flying missions started and I though they will never end! But I loved them because I'm not going to lie I SUCKED AT FLYING HELICOPTERS! Now I can thanks to this missions! :-D , the Objective Score looks like it was implemented on GTA V after this, that was cool, felt like fresh old optional objectives, really cool tho. I really don't recomend it to people that are really sensitive to terrorism topics, because this ""Episode"" has a lot of Terrorism on it. TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK (This is only for those kind of people, for the rest you'll enjoy it), the story was filled with a lot of funny moments and how they connect to the base game GTA IV really explains all the events happened that was clever!Then I played TLAD, I really HATED IT at first because you need to follow your gang It was like ""caged"" because you don't like maybe get orders from a major command? (when you already get them with the missions lol?), anyways I liked the crew system XCOM-like but the best part for me was the CREW HELP! WOAH, I felt really special! because sometimes I really needed help and they where just a call away and I never felt alone, BROTHERS FOREVER! this episode was not funny on the same way as TBOGT, but was SUPER FILLED with action, WARS and SHOOTINGS EVERYWHERE so CRAZEEEEE! was really cool in that aspect. The Objective Score was not in this ""Episode"", and the bikes where superb but I don't know it felt more shorter for me than TBOGT, maybe because I mostly didn't stopped playing it because it was so good. Both Episodes are brutal and I really enjoyed them, hope to see more like this content on future GTA Titles.Mods used: - RealityIV- Real Gunshots Sounds- Realistic Driving EFLC- Flashlight 4 Weapons- ColAccel- ScriptHook .NET- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥If you are getting stuck on ""No. 3"" Mission (TBOGT) after you are going to pull down the cars and after the race cinematics just skip them to avoid freezing on loading, if doesn't load the mission at all enable Vsync or limit the framerate via command line.If you are falling through the ground in TLAD when starting the game and you are using ""ColAccel"" just delete or rename ""colCache.dat"" and start the game again.Hope you enjoy it as I did!

												The expansions to Grand Theft Auto IV do nothing to remedy the issues of the original game (see my recommendation for that title). If anything, they are steps downward from the original; they are repetitive, and the characters are difficult to enjoy. The main character from The Lost and the Damned is particularly unlikeable. In sum, these don't add much. They go on sale from time to time for a very affordable price; if you're going to buy them, then buy them at that reduced price.			"

												While the game is still burdened with the same DRM and bad port job as GTA IV, the addition of checkpoints to the missions makes the game play a lot smoother and less annoying. It makes me wonder why they didn't just go back and add them to IV - it would be a quick fix.The plot isn't as good as in GTA IV. Nico as a protagonist really grows on you and the main character just isn't as interesting. But otherwise, it works well as a continuation of GTA IV.			"

												Grand theft auto 4, what can i say that has not already been said? This game (and its 2 expansions) are works of video game art. The entire story and cinimatic parts of the gameplay play out like they are a movie rather than a game though, not on the level of Konami's Metal Gear franchise. The story follows Niko Bellic, a immagrant from (most likely) Yugoslavia or Ukraine looking to fufill the ""American dream"" with his cousin Roman. As the story gets deeper and you encounter more of Niko's old, and new, enemies you see that niko's dream to live the american dream turns into a nightmare. Also, games for windows live ♥♥♥♥ing sucks.			"

												So I recently reinstalled this game since I've been watching Son's of Anarcy and wanted a similiar experience to the tv show.  So once I've installed and launched it requires me to sign into Windows Live, and it wouldn't let me save untill I do.  Because of the simple fact I can't even progress though the game I say ♥♥♥♥ this game.  This is sad though because even though this game is good, although maybe not the best GTA game, it was still good.			"

												The game itself is quite nice. Especially since it features one of the very few openly gay videogame characters. The problem with it is, that it still needs Windows live to run, if you want to save games. A service wich is no longer supported by microsoft itself and never really was by any player. If you want to play online you also have to sign in into the ""Rockstar Social Club"". So if you want to run this game as intended you need to be signed in into three online platformes at once. Two of them are only there to make sure you bought the game. And in the case of Windows live to annoy you. So no thanks. Until they at least cut out this Windows live crap, this game is going into my libary limbo. What a shame.			"

												Summary: Overall The Ballad of Gay Tony and The Lost and Damned are great standalones with slight improvements to the original GTA 4. Each one offers roughly 5-9 hours of gameplay and new elements such as parachuting, base jumping, mini-games, weapons, and vehicles. 4.5/5.Packaged together, Episodes from Liberty City offer two standalone games that take on very different approaches to the original gameplay in GTA 4. Both offer their own single-player campaigns with roughly 5 hours of missions, mini-games, and a variety of new weapons and vehicles to spice up your experience. The stories, just like the original, are well-written and interweaves with Niko Bellic. Playing the original and then through the episodes will give a second perspective on who did what, where the diamonds came from, and so on. They aren't heavily dependent on knowing the original plot, but they can be better appreciated if you've played through it.The Lost and Damned takes the perspective of Johnny Klebitz, the vice-president of The Lost Motorcycle Club (TLMC). As you would expect, you primarily travel by motorcycle and much of the storyline is around the MC and their conflict with the police, rival gangs, and eventually the mafia.  There is a healthy heaping of new music revolving around the 1% culture, weapons such as the sawn-off shotgun and grenade launcher, and mini-games in the clubhouse such as arm-wrestling and air hockey. One of the big improvements, at least in my eyes, is the use of mid-mission respawns. If you die or fail a mission, restarting it via phone will no longer pull you to the very beginning of the mission. You will probably respawn before the segment where you failed, started. This cuts down on the amount of needless driving when you fail a mission and makes it less of a hassle restarting.The second episode is the Ballad of Gay Tony, which doesn't take you from the perspective of the flamboyantly gay Tony Prince (whom you may have noticed in Niko's story), but his bodyguard and partner Luis Lopez. If TLAD focused on motorcycles, it's safe to say that TBGT focused on helicopters, base jumping, parachuting, and night clubs. Again, TBGT's plot is interwoven into the original plot and fleshes out much of the why's and how's of that story. As with TLAD, there's almost a good half-dozen new mini-games, such as golf, dancing, drinking, parachuting, and races. If you had a hard time with the helicopter controls, then bad news, about 1/4 of the missions require piloting a helicopter at some point. Generally the storyline is well-written, the characters are great with Yusuf, the playboy millionaire Arab, Mori, the bodybuilding dwarf with a God complex, and Bulgarin, the Russian mobster collecting American rock memoribilia. The characters drive the storyline well and leaves the game with a satisfying conclusion.Overall the game improves on a few issues from the original, but there are still a few things that hamper your gaming experience. Controls are still finicky, with driving still painful (you'll come to hate motorcycles on the final TBGT mission), flight controls difficult, and shooting still frustrating at times. It'll put a smile on your face when you see an NPC struggle to get in and out of a vehicle, but make you cringe when your characters' pathing causes him to dart back-and-forth around a vehicle. Mission restart has been improved, maybe some way of fast-travel would make driving less of a burden but I'm sure they want the playtime to be buffed higher by needless traveling. In summary, it's a strong buy and I highly recommend the game, I think that if you especially like the original then you'll find enjoyment with the episodes. 4.5/5.			"

												EFLC is an amazing standalone DLC for GTA IV. Both storylines are action-packed fun (TLAD + TBoGT). Both begin with a bang, meeting the characters in a way. In TBoGT you start off in a cutscene where you're on the ground, and there are Irish brothers robbing a bank. It has a great sense of humour at times and has references to GTA IV itself (most of them are not spoilers, just showing the characters like Niko drive past or Roman at a club. TLAD starts off with a bang, where you are the Co-Leader of a Motorcycle Club. You get him back & then get his bike back.Good stuff. Another thing, the missions in EFLC have a lot more action in them compared to IV's in my opinion.If you do decide to get this, good luck out there. LC is one dangerous placeOh and, might wanna get yourself a GFWL and Rockstar Social Club account while you're game is downloading/installing. It'll help.			"

Software itself is well rendered and the modelling within the game is superb without causing my system to grind to a ultra slow march.

												Double the story, double the fun! This DLC actually contains two stories: you play as Johnny and also as Luis. Both stories take place in Liberty City and should be launched separately. Lost of The Damned felt a bit boring as the game put too much emphasis on the use of motorbikes. So, after a while I hated I couldn't really get into a car but Luis's story compensated me for that.There isn't much to say about these two stories. Everything is identical to the things we got used to in GTA IV. Perhaps, many of the missions seems a bit more over the top but it only increased the fun for me.Putting the bad optimisation aside this is a damn fine DLC.

												GTA Episodes from Liberty City is a collection of the 2 GTA 4 expansions: ""The Lost and Damned"" and ""The Ballad of Gay Tony"". Almost everything i had to say about the original GTA 4 also applies here, since the expansion are basically additional story missions with 2 new protagonists and some new additions. The story of the episodes has the same quality as the original, and they interwine in a cohesive way. TLAD is bike-focused, and TBoGT has new mechanics that will remind you of San Andreas. The missions are more varied too. The map is the same, but the soundtrack is new. It is shorter, but i enjoyed it more than the original. And TBoGT finally introduces a replay mission feature, with optional objectives to complete. The PC related issues are also the same. So, if you enjoyed GTA 4, you'll definitely enjoy this compilation.			"

												Wow. Just realized I had not reviewed this yet.. Pro's. Great addition to the GTA family. Based on what I ve seen of GTA V might be the last of the game play style that made GTA what it was. Of course, being a bit older now, the graphics are typical of the time, but fun and good to run with. The games both, have good story lines, but more important.. the ability to still be a total moron or not and just do what you want.. TBoGT being the best ever IMO. I love the ability to meet a girl in a club.. ' hit it ' in the bathroom of said club, then maybe or maybe not ever call her again... ah... just like RL. BEST PART OF THE GAMES:LCPDFR If your a cop fan. If you just want to occasionally play as a cop.. you need this and LCPDFR.. I ve not finished nor put in more than 20-25 hours of the games.. the rest is all playing the character of Officer Jeorg, 13 year vet, often suspended and no understanding as to the why of it.. along with his usual partner.. Marty.LCPDFR is still a totally free Mod, and it still has additions etc being created. LSPDFR is moving along.. but has slowed d/t all the cheating ( EXCUSE ME ) d/t the way they are trying to address the 'modders' corrupting GTA V.  ( ♥♥♥♥ing cheaters trying to make a nice name for it.. lol.. like when Cheaters got called hackers.. paaaleeeeaaassssee )			"

												I used to really enjoy this game back when it came out, so when it came out on sale again I decided to buy it before committing to the new GTA5. What a mistake I made, if I said the game was terribly bugging, especially with the addition of having to use windows live I would be making an understatement. What's more than enjoyable is the hour or two you'll find yourself in trying to set up game files, searching through every avenue of support pages, and the many attemtps at ""possible"" fixes.  If you computer has a video card with over 1GB of ram this game wont run on anything except the minimal  graphics, no exceptions. Unless you have the day off work, are pretty computer savvy, and have a tremedous amount of patience. Also I will not be buying the new GTA5 because of this.			"

												Definitely a lot better than GTAIV. Most annoying things has been fixed: steering, physics, combat, even radios has been improved. Both ""The Lost and Damned"" and ""Ballad of Gay Tony"" have more interesting stories, more diverse gameplay (attack helicopters, sky diving, and combined vehicle races). Interesting side activities are back while NOBODY calls you up for a bowling every 2 minutes.Before playing Episodes from Libery City I haven't got high hopes for GTAV, now I've changed my mind. The only problem with this DLC is that is standalone and all the changes are not implemented into GTAIV itselfP.S. GTA SA is still the bestest. "

												been playing video games since the 80s, and for me this is clearly (along with GTAIV) the best game in history. the level or detail and realism is just beyond imagination. been playing it for years and i keep discovering new things, new places .. i play EFLC TBOGT with Niko mod because in TBoGT you have clubs, taxi and opened islands since the beginning. EFLC have also more vehicles. honestly, if there wasn't a good Niko mod out there, i'm not sure i would have rated the same. i think i would have not rated and rated IV instead. the game graphics are still excellent, and with the modding you get an endless gaming experience. there are always nice mods coming out. from maps, to functionnality (scripts) , and of course vehicles. about the EFLC game itself, it's splitted into 2 games. one TBoGT where main character is an associate nightclubs owner, and the other TLaD where the character is a bikers gang member. TBoGT's atmosphere is dance music oriented, but missions are awful. i mean 80% of TBoGT missions are totally unrealistic (destroy a huge crane in city center, destroy a yacht 2 km from the coast, steal a subway with an helo..). in TLaD, atmosphere is metal rock, metamphet sh### and broken showers.if you encounter problems with the game launching, it's most of the time caused by obsolete Games for Windows thing. search on the net a tutorial that explains how to install things and in which order, and it should work fine			"

												There’s no contesting how good a game it is. My grievance however, is with the painfully annoying social club, drm, crap optimisation and bugs. My god the bugs!I’ve bought enough Rockstar games to know unequivocally, of their complete contempt for the pc community. It’s a rather hard learned lesson, but I’ll never give Rockstar another cent for their cynical shovelware. If I want to play a future Rockstar game, I’ll either pick up a console port or, better yet, just torrent it. "

												WOW! there is no other words to describe this game the story for both The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony are fantastic instead of going through the game as Niko Bellic this time you play as two new characters that were seen in the normal GTA IV game but not playable the two new characters Luis Lopez and Johnny Klebitz stories in the game are very interesting and will hook people in immediately. Still retaining the features from GTA IV The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony both add new features in the game that can only be used when playing EFLC for example The Ballad of Gay Toy adds parachutes to the game so now you can go and jump off the empire state building and not die when you hit the ground. Like in GTA IV you still explore Liberty City just this time you can access places that could not be accessed in GTA IV. Like I said the story for both games really will hook you in like GTA IV's story hooked me in when I first played the game both games adds up to about 80 hours of gameplay which will keep people entertained throughout both games. So if you're looking to buy a GTA game I really really recommend you get GTA IV and GTA EFLC they are both very enjoyable games and they will both blow you away without a doubt!.			"

												Rockstar has recently, with no warning, forcibly taken out content from one of their bigger games (GTA San Andreas): it's now missing music and video options it had before, plus all the savefiles were broken and mods turned uncompatible; it also introduced a lot of bugs, so some consumers can't even play the game anymore. It's definitely an illegal practice under any country's consumer laws, and that's why I can't, in good mind, recommend any of their games anymore, as there's no warranty that they won't be doing this to their other games.If you want better open-world, sandbox games, look for Saints Row 3 or 4, Just Cause 2 and Sleeping Dogs - besides being better games, their developers never stole content from their customers.

												Episodes from Liberty City é um pacote com as duas expansões de GTA 4, inicialmente lançadas separadamente, sendo que podem ser jogadas mesmo sem possuir o jogo de base. Ambas trazem pequenas variações no mapa em relação ao original e algumas pequenas novidades.O primeiro episódio, The Lost and Damned, diz respeito a uma gangue de motoqueiros que teve seu líder (Billy Grey) capturado pela polícia. Até que ele pudesse retornar, a gangue passou a ser comandada por Johnny Klebitz que guiou seus companheiros à prosperidade.No entanto, anos se passaram e com o retorno de Billy, ele estava totalmente transformado de forma que sua liderança estava destruindo tudo que havia sido construído e pondo em risco seus membros. Esta situação faz com que alguns dos membros se revoltem.Nesta expansão, o jogador controla Johnny, que por sinal se movimenta muito devagar, bem mais devagar que Nicko. Como há um maior foco em motocicletas, foram acrescentados alguns modelos novos e tornou-se praticamente impossível cair delas.Uma coisa ruim é que as vozes dos motoqueiros não combinam com os personagens e nos faz ter dificuldade de saber quem é quem está falando, o que prejudica um pouco o entendimento dos diálogos.Já o segundo episódio, The Ballad of Gay Tony, assumimos o papel de Luis Lopez, braço direito de Tony Prince, um viadinho dono das melhores boates em Liberty City. Luis é sócio de Tony e eles são apenas amigos, sendo que não há nenhuma outra relação entre eles.Diferente dos outros personagens, Luis vive na vida boa, tem um bom apartamento e várias mulheres. O problema é que o negócio das boates já não está tão lucrativo como antes, e seu mentor Tony se meteu em algumas enrascadas tentando diversificar os investimentos.The Ballad of Gay Tony tem as melhores músicas tocando nas rádios contando todos os GTA’s já lançados, pelo menos na minha opinião, além de missões frenéticas e um sistema de pontuação por missão que premia o jogador em realiza-las usando métodos específicos.Há nas duas expansões algumas adições muito bem vindas, como um sistema de checkpoints nas missões em que, no caso de falha, o jogador não precisa repetir a missão desde o começo, mas sim do último checkpoint.Também foram adicionados novos mini games, como queda de braço e competição de bebida, corridas com bastões e habilidade para dançar. Foi retirada (felizmente) a necessidade de ficar ligando para as pessoas para manter relacionamentos.O interessante é que as tramas das expansões ocorrem paralelamente a do jogo principal, sendo que por várias vezes passamos pelo mesmo local onde ocorreu algum evento e podemos ver os personagens dos outros jogos realizando as ações que fizemos, quando estávamos jogando com eles.Além disso, as histórias são interligadas, com várias referencias cruzadas, e há situações em que realizaremos missões  com a participação dos personagens dos outros jogos, o que nos ajuda a entender melhor qual o que ocorreu em cada evento.Algo que já acontecia no GTA 4 original, mas agora é muito frequente é o recebimento de alguma ligação que faz iniciar uma missão qualquer... Isso é muito chato porque não há como não aceitar e você deverá fazer aquela missão compulsoriamente naquele momento, mesmo que tivesse em mente fazer outra coisa.Não se pode deixar de mencionar que também foram herdados alguns bugs do título principal, mas pelo menos são bem menos numerosos, e não atrapalham tanto jogar como eram naquele, de forma que não há quase nada para reclamar do jogo.No fim das contas, se você jogou GTA 4, é praticamente obrigatório que você jogue suas expansões também, pois são bastante sólidas e talvez até mais divertidas que o título principal. EXCELENTE (9/10). "

Saints Row is a far superior choice... spend your money on that, kids.Looking back, I figured I should elaborate a bit more.  Saints Row kind of picked up where GTA: San Andreas left off.  More fun, less serious.  I didn't care for GTA 4 at all, especially forcing you to hang out with your ""friends"" and do mundane activities.  The Episodes from Liberty City just couldn't grab my attention at all, on top of my previous issues with GFWL (which is now dead, thankfully) and Rockstar Social Club.			"

												This is one of the greatest games ever made in my opinion. It is better than IV because of all the extra stuff like: Golden uzi, buzzard, loads of cars. I personally likes to mod weapons and things to make it even more cool. If you visit: ''http://www.gta4-mods.com/'' you find loads of script mods which you then can make the game exactly like ''GTA V'' if you want to. Defintley buy this if you like open world gameplay along with: guns, cars, outlaw, and action-games.			"

												I've already finished this game 100% on the cracked version, but since it was on sale, long ago,i thought maybe ill buy it.now that ive discovered the anti-aliasing support from my nvidia control panel, i can now freely play the game with maximum graphics. gameplay 10/10, storyline 10/10, the detail and ambience 10/10.overall 10/10 for me.

												Great game. Had a lot of weapons in game that felt that should have been in the original version. Over all very fun Ballad of Gay Tony was probably the most fun out of the GTA IV Ballad added fun and ridiculous missions while Lost and the damned was a little lack luster. I still hate the drm software that it forces you to sign up for. Also wish they would push an update that would remove it.			"

												It's hard to NOT reccomend EFLC. I mean yes, it still has some glaring issues from its brother, GTA 4, such as the just rather grey and depressing Liberty City (and TLaD doesn't do much to fix this, especially when it adds that grainy filter), the PC port (which I'll talk about more later) is still random, sometimes it will run great, other times it's like playing a slide show, and all of it varies from PC to PC. I've seen fixes that helped improve performance for some by 20 frames, and then when I try it it does nothing to the performance. But overall, you're getting a very solid package with EFLC.TLaD:This expansion in my opinion has the stronger story of the two, but the weaker world. You are ""Johnny the Jew"" part of a biker gang that has been on the fall since its peak in the 60s. The leader of your bike gang begins to go crazy with power, and starts a war with the AoD (Angels of Death), and as you can imagine, chaos ensues. I'm going to leave the story off from that since as I said it really is quite the ride, and if you liked GTA 4's story you'll really enjoy TLaD as Rockstar really managed to combine the stories quite well with several crossovers from Niko. This was the first game in a long time that I sat down and beat the story in one sitting, it really is that good in my opinion.However, if you DON'T like GTA 4's focus on story and grim approach, TLaD probably isn't for you. Now, that's not to say if you didn't like Niko's story you won't like Johnny's, as they are quite different, but Johnny's story is still very grim compared to other GTA stories (not to say it doesn't have its share of laugh out loud moments and some absurdity thrown in there). But if you're expecting this to bring the insanity of GTA:SA combined with a ton of unique side missions, TLaD is not for you. The only notable side missions include a new race mode with bikes and you now have the option to hit oppenents with bats to throw them off course, and a ""gang wars"" side mission which is cool on paper, with X-COM style mechanics in the sense that the more you use a gang memeber with out them dying the better they become in battle, but when they die that's it, they're dead and you have to start all over again with a new memeber. But the AI is just not good enough to make it worth your time, and often my team mates would die from a bomb I threw at a car that my team mates are trying to ram, no matter how hard I try to get them to get away. Also there are only like 5 scenarios that just repeat through out the 25 side missions, and only a few lines of dialogue that the characters just repeat over and over again. You do get some guns from doing it, but if you've already beaten the story, chances are you have a ton of ammo for these guns already.Overall I give TLaD a 8/10:Pros:Great StoryGreat mechanicsSome fun new toysOverall solid expereinceGreat Voice ActingCons:World feels lackingGrainy filter makes the game look ugly and even more washed outTBoGT:This expansion without a shadow of a doubt is one that every fan of the GTA series should play. The story, while not as strong as TLaD, wraps up many, if not all lose ends from GTA 4 and TLaD. The world is great fun with loads of side missions that will keep you busy for hours and hours. And you get some fantastic toys that brings back some of that absurdity many loved from GTA:SA.You are Luis Lopez, a former criminal who was involved with a lot of drug dealing in Northern Algonquin, but has since moved to Downtown Algonquin and changed his life around. He's now making a lot more money, works night clubs, and is the body guard of Tony Prince (Gay Tony) a once big shot going through a mid-life crisis, threatened by the closing of his night clubs under a new law in Liberty City, and he owes money to just about every major gang in Liberty City...I think you see where this is going. So through a 6-8 hours long story you'll go from blowing up cranes, highjacking trains, and riding planes. It truly is a fun time with some of the best missions in the GTA 4 trilogy. Also, the start of this expansion is in my opinion the best of the series. TBoGT also has a fantastic world, and in my opinion is more engaging than even GTA 4's. You have fight night matches, an awesome racing mode that has you jump out of a helicopter, land in a boat, then drive to a car, and race in the cars which also have nitrous, it really is fun. On top of that you have club managment which is...so-so it's rather boring as you just watch over the crowd for a few minutes but every time you do it you get a mission from some celeberity at the end of your shift, this ranges from simply escorting them from paparazzi to spraying people down with a fire truck, it feels very familiar to the wackiness in Saints Row 2, which is definitly not a bad thing. You also get base jumping side missions, which are really fun. You'll be jumping out of helicopters, off of buildings, and off of motorcycles mid-air, and it feels very similar to GTA:SA. And finally, you get some ""Drug War"" missions, which are very similar to the ""Gang Wars"" from TLaD, the only difference being they got rid of the X-COM mechanics and instead of just killing everyone, you normally have a goal to steal the ""product"" and cash and get it to a safe location without it blowing up or you dying. It's fun for the first few times, but just like the gang wars  it's really just like 5 scenarios repeated and the dialogue begins repeating.TBoGT will pretty much appeal to anyone that has liked a GTA game in the past, and in my opinion that's fantastic.Overall I give TBoGT a 10/10. Must play.The overall package is fantastic, and well worth your money. Rockstar did it again. PC PERFORMANCE:Yeah, so I'm going to be frank here, if you don't have a decent PC in TODAY standards, you may want to consider getting this on console. Now-a-days the game is so cheap on both platforms it's worth getting the PC version anyways just to mess around with mods, even if the game doesn't run so hot for you. But on my 660 and i5-3470 rig this game runs very poor, especially for its age and the visuals. The frame-drops in the game are just really strange, I've gone from 140fps in one second to 30 in the next, it's just all over the place, and I STRONGLY reccomend putting V-sync on to stop this, even though V-sync locks the fps at 55...seriously what the heck were you thinking Rockstar? Oh yeah, and the benchmark is pointless, unlike other games like Metro: LL where the benchmark pushes your PC to the limit and you'll never encounter that heavy of a load in game, the benchmark is really easy on your PC and I get almost double the fps average in the benchmark than I do in game... There are some fixes out there that are worth a try but I couldn't find one that worked for me. Also if you have more than 2GB of Vram the game won't let you change the settings (there are some fixes to this, just google it). And on top of it all, this game uses not ONE, not TWO, but THREE DRM services...including GFWL...yeah.So the PC port is pretty abysmal I must say, and I hope Rockstar treats the PC version of GTA V with more care (they better, considering how long we've waited). That being said, if you have the PC to run it well, this is WAY better looking than the console version, especially now that the shadows actually look like shadows and not blobs! And there are some cool PC exclusive features like your own radio station that plays your own songs, some improved animations, and the ability to save video clips and edit them together. Also, if you're like me and had a XBL account GFWL isn't all bad, as you can still get into private chats with people using the XB1 and 360, so that's sorta neat.			"

												Grand Theft Auto Episodes from Liberty City gives you two side stories to the main game, and tries to fix a lot of gripes people had with it. The Ballad of Gay Tony in particular was clearly an attempt at Rockstar getting back it's lost fanbase.The stories are interesting and the parallels to the main game fitting in places. However more then that they are a decent length. GTA4 made you feel it's length very often. The storyline felt really overly lengthy for such a small amount of things actually accomplished. In both of these episodes the storylines are tighter and more constrained. Not that it's a bad thing after all, they actually feel a lot more polished as a result.I recommend getting these if you already liked GTA4 but chances are, if you didn't like GTA4 you're most likely not going to buy these anyway.

												I can't recommend this game for PC.Is the game itself good? Yes, without a doubt.The problem is that the PC version is one of the worst ports you'll ever find.I had several problems that prevented me from even starting the game. I can't actually start the game via steam because I have to manually run the ""LaunchEFLC.exe"" file as administrator for it to actually start, or I will receive an error.I was also unable to edit anny graphics options due to a deliberate barrier set up to prevent you from changing the graphics if your PC is weak. Problem is, it also happens when your GPU has more than 2GB of VRAM.Last but not least, the game would automatically crash because I hadn't installed and patched Games For Windows Live.Even after I got it to work, there are still plenty of gameplay-related issues. Also, the framerate is unacceptable with my specs considered, and it even manages to crash to desktop now and then.TL;DR: Get it for your console if you can instead.			"

												A DLC for GTA 4, this game does will for itself. Having two distinct storylines and playstyles interlacing between each other is both a clever and intuitive show of other criminal life in the city apart from Niko's grand immigration adventure. I liked it. Although the pc controls are REALLY bad, particularly for helicopters. I had to actually rig one mission versus doing it properly because of the dificulty of controlling the damn chopper. Overall, I'd give it a 7.5/10 for gameplay. It's cool, its hip, but it's nothing you couldn't live without. "

												IV's engine was insane for it's time, and the soundtrack is so damn good as in any GTA. This engine is WAY more fun than GTA V. Play this with CryenbV3 it is a different game, it's GTA 4.5. Euphoria Natural Motion is so damn good in this it's incredible.. PC version has alternative radio stations as well as the console ones although it leaves a few to Niko's side. Most deep satired adverts out of any GTA game and the mmost varied music. Clubs are classic. Liberty city is nicely populated,  attention to detail is extremely impressive for its time. Natural motion and rigid body car physics that left huge dents, (unlike V). People go into a dynamic reaction that still wows me. What other game can you go around in that uses natural motion like this? The answer is absolutely none other, GTA V only has it sometimes and same as the cars, and it's extremely toned down from the natural motion on the people to the skeletons of them being rigid. Plus you can't get Red Dead properly for PC. Max Payne 3 has it but isn't free roam. (Got GTA IV on disc and have enb ICE1040) Best of all about this game is it's natural-motion reaction physics.

												First of all, I must say that the game needs an unofficial patch to run. Now lets go to the game itself: **The lost and damned analysis only** The mecanics are all the same of GTA IV, the difference is that this game has more bikes and other story. So: Bikes: There are more choppers, they dont really add mutch to the game. They are not satisfactory to drive, and the game forces you to do it un half of the missions. History: At first I didnt like it, I mean, there is nothing interesting at the beginning. After certain important point in the history, it starts to be good: New characters are added, and the whole game starts make sense, but when I really started to enjoy the game, it abruptly ended. Launch time was over maybe? We will never know In summary: Do I recommend this game? Yes It was Good? The last 15% of the history was good. On the other hand, it is horribly optimized, and needs a patch to run, so buy it only on sale			"

												Nice addition to GTAIV.  Adds on two ""campaigns"" to the main game. TBoGT in particular makes this pack entirely worth it. Brings back ""drug wars"" similarly to San Andreas, except instead of gaining turf, you get weapon spawns at your apartment. Lots of new weapons... lots of new missions... a new helicopter, and a tank!			"

												As a GTA fan since GTA3 came out for PC... I originally owned and played this one on xbox 360 shortly after it came out and then bought it again here on sale after finally building a capable enough PC. I've heard many people say bad things about the PC port of this and, while it could be improved, I can honestly say it still looks much better on PC with the graphics settings cranked up. Having the keyboard and mouse in addition to a 360 controller is great. What I love best though is the modding abilities. I've already played through the game and it's been a lot of fun going back and now playing with some mods I've found as well as trying out making my own mods.			"

												It's hard to NOT reccomend EFLC. I mean yes, it still has some glaring issues from its brother, GTA 4, such as the just rather grey and depressing Liberty City (and TLaD doesn't do much to fix this, especially when it adds that grainy filter), the PC port (which I'll talk about more later) is still random, sometimes it will run great, other times it's like playing a slide show, and all of it varies from PC to PC. I've seen fixes that helped improve performance for some by 20 frames, and then when I try it it does nothing to the performance. But overall, you're getting a very solid package with EFLC.TLaD:This expansion in my opinion has the stronger story of the two, but the weaker world. You are ""Johnny the Jew"" part of a biker gang that has been on the fall since its peak in the 60s. The leader of your bike gang begins to go crazy with power, and starts a war with the AoD (Angels of Death), and as you can imagine, chaos ensues. I'm going to leave the story off from that since as I said it really is quite the ride, and if you liked GTA 4's story you'll really enjoy TLaD as Rockstar really managed to combine the stories quite well with several crossovers from Niko. This was the first game in a long time that I sat down and beat the story in one sitting, it really is that good in my opinion.However, if you DON'T like GTA 4's focus on story and grim approach, TLaD probably isn't for you. Now, that's not to say if you didn't like Niko's story you won't like Johnny's, as they are quite different, but Johnny's story is still very grim compared to other GTA stories (not to say it doesn't have its share of laugh out loud moments and some absurdity thrown in there). But if you're expecting this to bring the insanity of GTA:SA combined with a ton of unique side missions, TLaD is not for you. The only notable side missions include a new race mode with bikes and you now have the option to hit oppenents with bats to throw them off course, and a ""gang wars"" side mission which is cool on paper, with X-COM style mechanics in the sense that the more you use a gang memeber with out them dying the better they become in battle, but when they die that's it, they're dead and you have to start all over again with a new memeber. But the AI is just not good enough to make it worth your time, and often my team mates would die from a bomb I threw at a car that my team mates are trying to ram, no matter how hard I try to get them to get away. Also there are only like 5 scenarios that just repeat through out the 25 side missions, and only a few lines of dialogue that the characters just repeat over and over again. You do get some guns from doing it, but if you've already beaten the story, chances are you have a ton of ammo for these guns already.Overall I give TLaD a 8/10:Pros:Great StoryGreat mechanicsSome fun new toysOverall solid expereinceGreat Voice ActingCons:World feels lackingGrainy filter makes the game look ugly and even more washed outTBoGT:This expansion without a shadow of a doubt is one that every fan of the GTA series should play. The story, while not as strong as TLaD, wraps up many, if not all lose ends from GTA 4 and TLaD. The world is great fun with loads of side missions that will keep you busy for hours and hours. And you get some fantastic toys that brings back some of that absurdity many loved from GTA:SA.You are Luis Lopez, a former criminal who was involved with a lot of drug dealing in Northern Algonquin, but has since moved to Downtown Algonquin and changed his life around. He's now making a lot more money, works night clubs, and is the body guard of Tony Prince (Gay Tony) a once big shot going through a mid-life crisis, threatened by the closing of his night clubs under a new law in Liberty City, and he owes money to just about every major gang in Liberty City...I think you see where this is going. So through a 6-8 hours long story you'll go from blowing up cranes, highjacking trains, and riding planes. It truly is a fun time with some of the best missions in the GTA 4 trilogy. Also, the start of this expansion is in my opinion the best of the series. TBoGT also has a fantastic world, and in my opinion is more engaging than even GTA 4's. You have fight night matches, an awesome racing mode that has you jump out of a helicopter, land in a boat, then drive to a car, and race in the cars which also have nitrous, it really is fun. On top of that you have club managment which is...so-so it's rather boring as you just watch over the crowd for a few minutes but every time you do it you get a mission from some celeberity at the end of your shift, this ranges from simply escorting them from paparazzi to spraying people down with a fire truck, it feels very familiar to the wackiness in Saints Row 2, which is definitly not a bad thing. You also get base jumping side missions, which are really fun. You'll be jumping out of helicopters, off of buildings, and off of motorcycles mid-air, and it feels very similar to GTA:SA. And finally, you get some ""Drug War"" missions, which are very similar to the ""Gang Wars"" from TLaD, the only difference being they got rid of the X-COM mechanics and instead of just killing everyone, you normally have a goal to steal the ""product"" and cash and get it to a safe location without it blowing up or you dying. It's fun for the first few times, but just like the gang wars  it's really just like 5 scenarios repeated and the dialogue begins repeating.TBoGT will pretty much appeal to anyone that has liked a GTA game in the past, and in my opinion that's fantastic.Overall I give TBoGT a 10/10. Must play.The overall package is fantastic, and well worth your money. Rockstar did it again. PC PERFORMANCE:Yeah, so I'm going to be frank here, if you don't have a decent PC in TODAY standards, you may want to consider getting this on console. Now-a-days the game is so cheap on both platforms it's worth getting the PC version anyways just to mess around with mods, even if the game doesn't run so hot for you. But on my 660 and i5-3470 rig this game runs very poor, especially for its age and the visuals. The frame-drops in the game are just really strange, I've gone from 140fps in one second to 30 in the next, it's just all over the place, and I STRONGLY reccomend putting V-sync on to stop this, even though V-sync locks the fps at 55...seriously what the heck were you thinking Rockstar? Oh yeah, and the benchmark is pointless, unlike other games like Metro: LL where the benchmark pushes your PC to the limit and you'll never encounter that heavy of a load in game, the benchmark is really easy on your PC and I get almost double the fps average in the benchmark than I do in game... There are some fixes out there that are worth a try but I couldn't find one that worked for me. Also if you have more than 2GB of Vram the game won't let you change the settings (there are some fixes to this, just google it). And on top of it all, this game uses not ONE, not TWO, but THREE DRM services...including GFWL...yeah.So the PC port is pretty abysmal I must say, and I hope Rockstar treats the PC version of GTA V with more care (they better, considering how long we've waited). That being said, if you have the PC to run it well, this is WAY better looking than the console version, especially now that the shadows actually look like shadows and not blobs! And there are some cool PC exclusive features like your own radio station that plays your own songs, some improved animations, and the ability to save video clips and edit them together. Also, if you're like me and had a XBL account GFWL isn't all bad, as you can still get into private chats with people using the XB1 and 360, so that's sorta neat.			"

												Ok, Rockstar you released this game nearly 5 years ago and when this game was first announced i♥♥♥♥♥♥my pants i couldnt believe that i could not only return to liberty city but also could play two different stories as gta 4 was a little lame.., it still had its charm though ,but i digress, this game is awesome, why? well not only are graphics better (well sorta) but has a way better story arch, new weapons and some returning weapons from gta 4 ,way better missions and better characters. Each story represents the different difficulties for instance GTA: TLAD is for more beginner types whereas GTA: TBOGT is for more experienced players the missions are far more difficult and provides plenty of challenge..., as for gameplay its overall the same as GTA IV accept the addition of new running animations of the characters and a few new vehicles however theres one particular vehicle and weapon that tops them all of course ill let you find out but its awesome,,,now for the mods..oh my, there are hundrends upon thousands of free mods for this game and not to mention there are so many modding websites dedicated to this game but my final verdict for this game is a 8/10 the game could have had a higher score if rockstar didnt use the same formula from GTA IV and added new gameplay styles like being arrested which is in fact a long awaited feature....you know?

												This is one of the greatest games ever made in my opinion. It is better than IV because of all the extra stuff like: Golden uzi, buzzard, loads of cars. I personally likes to mod weapons and things to make it even more cool. If you visit: ''http://www.gta4-mods.com/'' you find loads of script mods which you then can make the game exactly like ''GTA V'' if you want to. Defintley buy this if you like open world gameplay along with: guns, cars, outlaw, and action-games.			"

												A DLC for GTA 4, this game does will for itself. Having two distinct storylines and playstyles interlacing between each other is both a clever and intuitive show of other criminal life in the city apart from Niko's grand immigration adventure. I liked it. Although the pc controls are REALLY bad, particularly for helicopters. I had to actually rig one mission versus doing it properly because of the dificulty of controlling the damn chopper. Overall, I'd give it a 7.5/10 for gameplay. It's cool, its hip, but it's nothing you couldn't live without. "

												First of all, I must say that the game needs an unofficial patch to run. Now lets go to the game itself: **The lost and damned analysis only** The mecanics are all the same of GTA IV, the difference is that this game has more bikes and other story. So: Bikes: There are more choppers, they dont really add mutch to the game. They are not satisfactory to drive, and the game forces you to do it un half of the missions. History: At first I didnt like it, I mean, there is nothing interesting at the beginning. After certain important point in the history, it starts to be good: New characters are added, and the whole game starts make sense, but when I really started to enjoy the game, it abruptly ended. Launch time was over maybe? We will never know In summary: Do I recommend this game? Yes It was Good? The last 15% of the history was good. On the other hand, it is horribly optimized, and needs a patch to run, so buy it only on sale			"

												The gameplay of TBOGT is much better than the original game. You get crazy weapons, a ridicolously fun assault helicopter and   the missions are all very entertaining, right from the first one! Unlike GTA IV, here, the whole action starts right from the beginning. Overall, I find TBOGT better than GTA IV in any aspect, although the story of Nico is deeper. Personally, I didn't like The Lost and Damned too much, but it was okay.			"

												These two chapters are actually entirely better than the base game of GTA4. In fact I would recommend these over it; More guns, more characters, more fun, and better characters and stories. Also Ballad of Gay Tony has an explosive shotgun, I love it!			"

												Well, I don't really know how I should review this game nowadays, because back then when I've played I didn't have to endure any kind of problem involving the MSN Live's network. Either way, those two games in one were like the best expansion pack that I've ever played in a long time. In one of those stories you get to control this guy who owns a night club and has a partnership with this gay guy. As for the other one, you assume the role of the leader of a bikers gang. There's not really much diversity compared to the original game, but these two different stories certainly add something else to the whole spectrum. I also read in some reviews that people were having to deal with some crashes, I also had to deal with this really annoying one that would happen everytime during this mission that involved a train (The Ballad of Gay Tony). I don't really know how I actually managed to pass that, it must've been some sort of miracle but in the end everything worked out, so I'm giving everything a thumbs up.			"

												Episodes from liberty city is pretty good its not as good as gta V but this will do for now until it comes to steam. this time you play as to new characters from the original game you play as john and luis john is the vice president of the LOST which is a biker gang and Luis is a party guy who likes to party he works for gay tony which as you expected people think he is gay  it introduces new weapons and items such as the sawed off shotgun and the famous parachute and allsow adds new game modes to multiplayer new mini games to play when your bored like dancing arm wrestling drinking some shots and more.

												I recommend the game but Rockstar's Social Club launcher for gta 4 is the most annoying thing I've encountered. Much more annoying than all the most annoying video game characters in the world. If anything, the ""Social Club login failed."" problem is more annoying to me than my games freezing or crashing after hours of play without saving.Rockstar, you make great games. But you feel like a pain when your content fails to function properly.			"

I still love the game 3 years later however it's vbery hard to get running correctly it's sad that rockstar dropped all support for it but if you look around hard enough there are fixes available. But without rockstar support the game will never be like it once was.			"

												Game used to run flawlessly on my old computer that I played on roughly 2 years ago.  I have a new system now and decided to play some of my ""old"" games...this won't even finish installing.After reading some reviews, I'm not the only one having issues.  Apparently, newer systems (especially with Windows 10) won't install this properly.  I believe some people got it working, but only after a good amount of tweaking.Won't recommend this game at all until this issue is resolved.If you have an older system (running Windows 7), this game worked and was very fun to play.  If you have a newer setup, skip this game purchase, unless you feel like tackling the install problems - and there is no gaurentee that you'll get it running.			"

												Gta 4 episodes from liberty city is such a fun game to play (mainly the blad of gay tony). However on pc it still runs like crap and crashes frequently in windows 10 (with out changing compatibility settings to Windows vista SP2) my pc can almost max out gta 5 and higher frame rates, and with no support from rockstar it really shows they only care about gta5 and there older titles in the series. Even though the game runs like crap on console it actually works and doesn't have secuROM or GFWL. Until Rockstar can fix the issues with gta4 and its DLC i cannot recommend this game to anyone. Pick it up when its on sale because the game is not worth  $21			"

												Well, what is there to say. After an investment of $20 you have a good chance of finding out it was all for nothing. After pressing the ""play game""  button you experience absolutely nothing at all. This atrocity of a game makes no effort to run whatsoever and Im starting to question if it was even supposed to in the first place. After tampering through mutliple online forums and whatnot you realize everyone and their mother has this problem and most people would say not to buy this is the first place...if only i knew.			"

												Developers, take note. This is how you create DLC. Two episodes that span around 15 hours of gameplay (more if you're going to do everything). It feels like a whole new game. Yes, the city is still the same, but the stories aren't and the missions are quite diverse. One thing I really liked was the fact that all important characters are in a way part of the other characters' stories. The graphics and details are still awesome to this day (and the faces could still use some work). The missions from The Lost And Damned (and the story itself) aren't as much fun when compared to The Ballad Of Gay Tony. The missions in Gay Tony range from racing to stealing and basejumping. There's also a few helicopter missions. Flying a helicopter is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥though, and it's one of the things I really hate. But that can be overlooked. This game is great ! Recommended ![Rating: 92/100]			"

												It's GTA IV, but with more fluid game mechanics. What you probably want to hear is whether it's worth getting, whether it fills the gap until GTA 5 hits the shelves. So in a word, yes. In two words, sort of.The game engine is still the GTA IV engine, of course; don't expect any dramatic changes between GTA IV and Episodes From Liberty City (EFLC). The only discernible differences are better driving (motorbikes! yay!) and cover taking mechanics, as well as slightly better AI and new radio content. The graphics are still the same ones that taxed the hell outta all our PC's back when IV was released; this old engine seems to have been optimized quite a bit since then, even if the physics are still a bit buggy in large scale explosions or bridge traffic pileups (yup, they still periodically do that weird stacking thing on the bridge). The AI as mentioned before has better cover taking, especially when in a firefight with allies. But, when♥♥♥♥♥♥gets real, you'll quickly realise that the AI can't handle certain things. There were moments in my playthrough where i'd be in a firefight and just move myself behind a solid object that i could still fire over or around, and find myself then being able to systematically slaughter any bot that had the temerity to walk into my fireline. The soundtrack to the game is pretty decent. The LC Rock station with Iggy Pop in particular was to my mind the best thing about the Radio stations. There's a fair few gems in the limited new content the radio stations get, but after a while you'll probably find yourself adding your own music just to keep things fresh.The storyline is alright; it fills in gaps between key events in Niko Bellic's story. In terms of the quality of the storytelling it's more or less your usual GTA fare. Lots of violence, swearing, racism, homophobia and misogyny coupled with explosions, gun fights and chase sequences. EFLC is just as cheesy, offensive and satirical as GTA has ever been, so if that's your bag you're in for a fun, nostalgic ride through that familiar virtual cesspit that is Liberty City.To summarise, there's nothing really *new* here, and whilst it's certainly a lot of fun revisiting LC through the eyes of two very different characters, after the 30 or so hours of gameplay it takes to rinse through it all, you can't help but feel like it was fun, but you've done it all before. You'll almost certainly find yourself very quickly forgetting the characters and their stories, but at least you'll have enjoyed the process.Overall: 3.5/5 Audio: 3/5Graphics: 3/5Gameplay: 4/5Nothing groundbreaking, revisits a lot of old ground, but it's still an exciting sojourn through a living, breathing city.

												While I hated GTA4, Episodes was actually WAY better.The controls, driving, and some of the visuals are still crap, as well as the car limit and being infected with GFWL, but there were actually some improvements in a few areas.Both extra campaigns each added some new and improved weapons, which added to the fun factor.The Lost and Damned was focused around being a biker, and as a result made the game a lot more interesting. The choppers are some of the better handing vehicles in the game, and there was almost always at least one around, and so you never had to drive one of those 4 wheeled icy marshmellows commonly known as 'cars' in GTA4 unless you REALLY wanted to.In addition to having your trusty gang deliver a bike to you whenever you wanted, you could also call them for backup, either just for fun, or to help you out on a difficult mission. Successfully completing missions leveled your gang members up, actually making them even more useful.Lost was definitely the most enjoyable version of GTA4 for me. Probably because it felt a little more like Saints Row.The Ballad of Gay Tony wasn't quite as good as Lost, mostly because you were back to reliance on cars for most of your traveling and didn't have the option of backup whenever you wanted. But it DID have the explosive shotgun.And dancing. Don't ask me why the dancing was so fun. Maybe because the rest of the gameplay was so meh.Getting a dance-off going at the Hercules was probably the best part of the episode.Each episode was around 10 hours for mostly the story missions, but they felt a lot more fun overall. While you still got calls to hang out every so often, it wasn't nearly as bad as GTA4.There also weren't as many difficult missions as there were in GTA4, and there were much more plentiful checkpoints in the ones that were difficult.While Episodes still shares a lot of problems with GTA4, if you REALLY want to play a GTA4 game, I'd recommend just playing Episodes from Liberty City. There will be a few plot holes, but who's playing a GTA game for plot?			"

												This needed A LOT of internet searching and fixing to get it run on my Windows 8.1:- Install Games for Windows Live- Set the main EXE-file to run in Vista Service Pack 2 compatibility mode- Manually add a registry key to tell the system where the game files are installed, for example: [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Rockstar Games\EFLC]""InstallFolder""=""D:\\spiele\\steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Grand Theft Auto IV Episodes from Liberty City\\EFLC""So, if you are not a nerd wanting to spend some time searching how to get this thing working, installing extra stuff, and hacking in the registry, this is not for you.It still crashes when quitting the game, but at least it now finally runs.

												Played it on PS3 back in the day, great game. However the pc port is rubbish. I can run Gtav on ultra with all additional settings turned on with silky 60fps. Yet struggle to hit 30fps on medium in GTAIV. Frame rate regularly tanks to mid teens seemingly at random. Thankfully with steam refunds you can try it for yourself and just refund if you cannot run the game to an acceptable standard.			"

												GTA: EFLC is more of a game pack that consists of 2 games, GTA: The Lost and Damned, and GTA: The Ballad of Gay Tony.GTA: TLADYou play as a biker called Johnny, and the game has many interesting activities/missions, activities like Arm Wrestling, Pool (I think), Darts and more. The multiplayer has some gamemodes that might be more interesting than Free Roam (will talk more about it on TBOGT), yet I haven't played them because the multiplayer is dead pretty much.GTA:TBOGTYou play as Luis Lopez, a guy who works for a man named Tony (Nickname: Gay Tony). The game is generally better in terms of visuals and more fun things to do. In terms of visuals, TBOGT did a good job of removing the annoying color thing that makes the game more grey like in GTA IV. TBOGT has activities, just like TLAD, but there's one that isn't seen in other GTA games (I think). Cage fighting. It's basically you fighting against some people, or you can spectate and bet your money on who you think is gonna win. When you fight, each round you fight against 3 different people, there's 5-6 rounds in total. And now the Multiplayer. It's a pretty fun experience, Free Roam and the other gamemodes maybe too. I like Free Roam, because it lets you do atleast one activity that you can't do in other GTA IV games (normal IV and TLAD), that's parachuting. It's fun if you find a way to do stuff like:Actual parachutingDying in the best way possibleStart the sky diving thing, fall and have a low chance of living (from the top of a building), it also has uses for free running, too. Free running is pretty fun if you find the places to do so. They are commonly found near parachuting locations, or other buildings in the game (Lots of them are enterable, and I think most of them can give access to a rooftop). Now, you might be wondering, how can sky diving possibly help? Here's the answer. Without a parachute on, you couldn't really jump far. While with one on, you could start the sky diving which lets you travel further distances, for example that one stair case that's in the opposite building. Overall, it's a fun experience, both singleplayer and multiplayer.			"

												I most enjoyed this title even though it was on the same map as GTA4 it had so much to offer!!PROS:✔ Sick story telling with huge amounts of humor. Man I will never get bored of some of the hilarious moments during dialogues and cinematics while doing quests.✔ They kept the radio stations interesting. Indeed they did! Loved the talkshows. Loved the commercials. Loved that they kept the independence radio station system. And totally loved the hilariousness included in each dialogue, comment or ad in them as should be in a predecessor of the GTA cult!✔ Interesting script. Especially loved the The Ballad of Gay Tony. I first played the tBoGT and afterwards I played tLaD campaign. I enjoyed it. And I totally loved how nicely they both blend in the exact same world in the exact same timing.✔ Loved the little crossovers here and there with Niko from GTA4.✔ Absolutely awesome quality and quantity of weapons!✔ Insane attention to details by the devs. From the graphical effects of dust and dirt on surfaces down to pedestrian AIs and material and texture design. The city looks live and real. Hell, even the music and sound effects are more realistic! Even braking the glass of a car's window affects the music volume from the car radio!!✔ Awesome voice acting as expected from a GTA game.✔ Awesome water and sea dynamics. It felt so natural and relaxing driving a boat, even if it was a really slow one.CONS:✖ Terrible follower AI. Their combat tactics and driving skills were a complete disaster. They kept getting in the way many times during battles. They drive like freakin psychopaths on crack even if you drive like a 70yo lady.✖ I was expecting a way better lip sync.✖ Inexcusable rendering mistakes from various city locations. Invisible walls or flooring and pavement textures. They are not many. But they shouldn't really exist. I mean they did put down so much detail in so many other things and some of the graphical bugs are so hard to miss it makes you think they were too bored to care fixing them.✖ WHY THE HELL DO YOU FORCE US TO PUT UP WITH THAT PIECE OF SH*T GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE INTERFACE? F*cking Hell it♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off all the time!! App runs like a freakin faulty spyware! Can't get rid of it, eating up space and bandwidth. Kept disconnecting all the freakin time and totally bugged out 90% of my checkpoint auto-save games (it actually kept informing me that I already had the checkpoint savegames from quests I was doing for the first time!). WTH dudes?!? Is't the Rockstar Games Social Club app enough for middleware launch and you also had to add the buggy as f*ck Games For Windows Live interface too? WHY?Heard that GTA5 won't be having it.... Thank God!MIXED:☢ Some face expressions needed a bit work done. They made a great effort bringing realism in all characters plain NPC citizents included. But then you get to see some hideous face expressions from women when dancing with them at the club. Or seeing yoru character having the same angry face expression through the game even if all the action is hours (ingame) past the moment.☢ I really wish we could dive underwater...☢ I needed more collectibles.FINAL VERDICT:I enjoyed the game a whole lot, so much that I was able to put aside all the negatives or mixed feelings during gameplay that I would totally recommend this game.I'm giving it a 8/10. For me personally it could had been higher if it wasn't for the irritating Games For Windows Live interface.it's a good enjoyable game worth spending time on. If your PC can handle it and haven't played it yet please do.Totally worth buying on special offers.			"

												This game should absolutely not be for sale in it's current state. Here is a list of steps that I had to take to run the game once. (Since quitting that one session I have been unable to load the game a second time.) Once installed, clicking 'play' did nothing. No GTA, no error messages either. Upon consulting Google, I downloaded and installed Games for Windows Live. (Hasn't this been discontinued? Why is this even still available?) After installing and attempting to launch the game, I was presented with an error message. Progress! Error 'Seculauncher failed to start application [2000].' After more Googling, running the .exe as an administrator solved this problem. I'm finally in the game! Oh, the resolution is stuck at 800x600. I'll just change that. I can't. Great. After more Googling, I have to create a text file (commandline.txt) in the game directory and add the following parameters: '-nomemrestrict -norestrictions'. Apparently this is because I have TOO MUCH video memory on my laptop. I can't add these as launch parameters within Steam because I'm having to launch the game as an administrator from the game directory each time. Holy crap, I managed to change the resolution! And I'm in the game! Awesome! Time for a break. I'll just close this game and reopen it later. Okay, I'm back. GTA, here I come! Oh, now the loading screen just loops infinitely. Wonderful. Back to Google. Apparently this problem is also related to having too much video memory. Except the launch parameters I added should have already solved it. I give up.Stay away from this. It's a wreck. "

												People say this game doesn't work. Not only does this work on my windows 7 Alienware, it also works on my windows 8.1 CybertronPC. It's honestly best to still do some research about a product and not just trust reviews... Don't even base your opinion about this game from my review. Do some research then decide what you want to spend your money on when you think you've learned enough about the product you were thinking about buying. I do think this is still worth it... It is like GTA IV but with more weapons, vehicles and a different character. It's like another GTA game. And one more thing, you could always get this during a sale... Steam always has sales... I got this game plus the original GTA IV for $10 during a sale.			"

												DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS! IT IS BROKEN AND DOESNT WORK!as everyone else is claiming the social club login wont let you play online, then the games for windows live makes it so you cant save the game. also if you have a computer that is less than 4 years old it wont run right and get like 10fps on lowest settings at 480p (even on my gtx970, 16gb ram and i7 5700),it is absolutely unplayable. I've tried multiple ways to fix it but still no go. you get a prompt half way through installing saying it is not compatible with windows 10 and may not work correctly, and guess what it doesn't.THIS WILL NOT BE FIXED ANY TIME SOON, I emailed rockstar before buying and they assured me that they don't know of any issues and basically ignored people who have been saying for months it doesn't work. what a fool of me to trust there lies!I have no idea why steam hasn't pulled it off sale?!

												Word of Caution: You have to tweak with a file or 2 to get the game to run well. Besides that, currently on this day Dec 2 2016, they updated the game a few days ago which helped with the social club login. You can now play multiplayer again by linking your xbox account to your social club by using the games for windows live. You can play single player and multiplayer now! Only caveat is not many people play multiplayer that much anymore because of the problems in the past that lasted years. If you have a few friends with this game I think it is safe to say you can jump right back on this game with some buddies and have some good old fun.			"

But when former bum-buddy Will Smith returns to the scene to settle some old scores, Carlton must find it with himself to stand up for what's right, and ruthlessly slaughter as many pedestrians as he can in hilarious automobile accidents. Along the way he will make sarcastic remarks as zany, over-the-top and downright racist depictions of characters do stereotypical things until you can no longer bleed them dry of money. You will experience utter bliss as you use virgin-tight  shooting controls to kill the same korean character model over and over and over. You can also experience Ground Zero for the first major gainaxing of a hairy erect♥♥♥♥♥♥in a video game.Oh and theres also a Sons of Anarchy mode but thats for limpdicked middle-aged men from Connecticut with daddy issues and sociopathic tendencies.

												Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty CityPositives:+ WOW, this game has a huge amount of content for an expansion, so refreshing. Around 40 hours gameplay which is about the same as the original main game! Totally worth it for that reason alone. Lots of little side missions to complete.+ Graphics are good.+ Two different story arcs, one following the Lost Motorcycle Club and the other focused on Gay Tony, a nightclub owner. Both of these stories are interesting, the characters stand out and it's extremely fun.+ Nice shooting and combat as usual!+ Some real blockbuster moments towards the end, which is great.Negatives:I can't really see anything bad about this expansion. Tonnes of gameplay time, engaging and enjoyable, price comes down on sale regularly.Overall Score: 8.5/10To be honest, these two expansions alone could be more intriguing than the entire main game mode. At least, it's on par. Very good expansion that is worth purchasing when cheap. Look for it during the upcoming 2014 Christmas Sale, or for that matter, any major event in the future.			"

												Not super long (19 hours or so for both stories for me, and I like to mess around in the sandbox), but both The Lost and The Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony capture the interest and humour that were so lacking in the main story. I would go so far as to recommend playing these episodes far more than playing Niko's story, which can be very slow at times. Surprisingly well optimised for a Rockstar game too.			"

												9/10 - Grand Theft Auto: Episodes in Liberty City fixies so much about the previous game (Grand Theft Auto IV) as it manages to incorperate a serious story with fun gameplay as many aspects are added in/ added back in to the game, like parachutes, nightclubs. It is the nightclubs that really breath some life in to the Grand Theft Auto IV Trilogy as it offers fun gameplay with a number of funny situations and outcomes. GTA:EFLC even manages to improve other aspects of the game like the physics, which are considerably improved in this entry, I can't tell what they did to improve this but it just feels alot better and nature in this entry (TBoGt specifically). These added aspects do of course have their disadvantages, for one they easily expose the fact that the game map itself is quite small in comparison to other open worlds, this is evident by the use of multiple flying and parachuting sequences in game. If you like story based games as well as games with fun gameplay I don't see why you wouldn't like it, it's a win win situation			"

												Ran fine in Windows 10 on a GTX 970 with the 11/29/2016 patch, maybe two crashes total.  You run this separate game to play either Lost and the Damned or the Ballad of Gay Tony.  Both are definitely optimized/tweaked/balanced more than the original GTA 4 (nice touches like mid-mission continues).  It's the same city but starts fully unlocked for both.  There are new characters and new interiors.  Neither require that you have beaten GTA4 first, but I highly recommend you do because there are crossovers.  See my review on GTA4 to get the basic idea... but if you like that and wnat more this is worth it.Lost and the Damned is all about a biker gang.  You don't have to use a bike in every mission, but in the few that require it I really hated having to cruise over slowly (since taxis are not an option).  Be ready for chase sequences where you have to aim, follow, and kill other drivers.  The story is depressing without anything terribly interesting about it.  Definitely the weaker of the two DLC and I would say it is missable entirely.Play the BoGT last!! It's a celebration of the game... not taking itself too seriously and getting into the thrill seeking side of GTA.  There are some optional ""club management"" sequences that play like I imagine the Sims is, but there's also some BASE jumping style stuff that really is a blast.  The story is chaotic but still fun.Based on the BoGT alone I'd give this a value of $8, assuming you've already beaten the GTA4 main game proper.			"

												GTA IV and the EFLC expansion are a great sandbox, but the storylines are uninspired and it's a real chore just to get the game to launch.

It's great fun when you get it to work and I spent a lot of time tooling around in it, but Just Cause 2 and Saints Row 3 would be better purchases.			"

												I seriously can't believe I'm doing this, I'm giving a bad rate to a Grand Theft Auto game... I love the serie, I really do, but this PC version is just terrible! The game is a masterpiece, I've played it a million times on my Xbox 360, but this PC version is a just one of the worst ports I ever seen...The issue with this game is basically just one: Performance.The performance of this game is atrocious, the optimization is really bad. I have a medium-end PC that, according with the system requirements, would run it almost on the maximum performance. Guess what? I had to put the lowest game options on everything, no shadows, no anti-aliasing, minimum distance-view, no V-sync, and still only achieved 10 fps, lot of crashes, etc...Basically, this game is only playable in highest end PCs, and even on those the performance isn't really good.Until this game is properly optimized (which is never), I can't recomend this to anyone. Its really a shame, it's an imensely good game, but unplayble... Consider buying the consoles version.			"

												GRAND THEFT AUTO: EPISODES FROM LIBERTY CITYThe Lost and DamnedSupplement about Jewish biker johnny. went out earlier, so with him and begin. Our main hero — the Vice-President office of the brotherhood of the Lost in liberty city. He calmly and judiciously conducts business of the organization, one does not give offense to and all that. A real goodie, although in the course of action a will release caustic jokes about its origin. Anyway, while the President of the section — Billy gray — rehabilitated from heroin addiction, johnny earned a reputation and proved himself a good leader. And then one happy day the leader returned from work and immediately began imposing a new order.Apparently, during treatment, and much Billy thought hard about the softness of the seat under your own♥♥♥♥♥ so his first action on the outside was the war with another gang called Angels of Death. Moreover, the reasons for this newly issued Chapter has chosen not the most successful — lies, deception, incitement and slander. For example, the daughter of Mikhail Faustin contacted the biker of the Lost — we killed it in the role of Niko. This situation without a trial Billy gray dumped for a rival group and with hoots led the brothers to destroy their headquarters. Actually the reason for the attack was heroin, which the President later again and tied. Johnny stands at the head of the gang... and it's time to figure out what you can do in liberty city, when fighting on the shoulders of the leather jacket, in the hand of the evil gun, and at his back a powerful rumbling chopper.The Ballad of Gay Tony""Ballad"" should be taken only after The Lost and Damned. Otherwise you will be disappointed: additions are so different in execution, I can't believe the story of a biker at least some relation to the glitz and glamour of night life. This, of course, not about the appearance of the main characters.Despite the name, we will not be in the role of Tony (it would probably have caused a rejection from the audience), and in the skin of his best friend, companion and just a great man Luis Lopez. He's a regular guy, without protruding ambitions and, frankly, not particularly clever. But sincere and honest, calm and considerate, sensitive and loyal friend, but if you really♥♥♥♥♥♥him off... Literally from the first minutes the character draws attention to the detail of character, it is easy to understand, and because worried a very natural way.			"

												So i bought this game on Steam because i knew it was a fun game since i have it on my xbox 360, and knew I would evantually run into a few problems but thought solving them would be worth it. So the first problem was after i  downloaded the game for 5 hours i go to lauch it and it fails to lauch. So i download the latest version of windows live for windows 10 from the microsoft website and lauch the game, that took me an hour to do. Then after i launch the game and start it up the  quality of the graphics was horrendus so i open up the menu and go to set the game to run at a higher resolution and guess what i cant... So i looked up a video and typed in some commands and was able to change the resolution. Then i get back on the game with no problem. Then i wanted to play online and i try to and it tells me I have to log into Social Club, so i quit the game and went to log into Social Club and i type in the CORRECT PASSWORD AND USERNAME THAT I HAD JUST RESTET  and try to click play but no there was the next problem it says ""Social Club login failed , please try again"" so i gave up, i have NEVER had such a bad experince with a steam game.

												This game consists of two components: The Ballad of Gay Tony and the Lost & Damned. For the Ballad of Gay Tony: This game was poorly constructed to misrepresent the context of the LGBT community and exagerates the steryotypes most heard of in the United States, consequently leading to the inevitable stockpile of cliches featured in the game. As for the Lost & Damned, it was a disappointment following the excellent storyline in GTA:IV. The level of engagement and realism is poor given the player will most likely not be able to relate to the player he is controlling. I personally did not enjoy this as much as GTA:IV or GTA:V.			"

I try to login with my Hotmail account,and it says that my password is wrong... How the hell can my password be wrong on account that I login to almost every day?! I just unistalled game and was so frustrated that I punched my screen... I will most definitely never again try to play some stupid Rock Star game again.

												Easily these games are better then the normal GTA IV.While I love GTA IV a lot, I'll admit the story is meh, Niko isn't a very intresting charater and its kinda ironic that Roman often steals the spotlight in that game.However here you get two stories about two charaters, ones a biker and the other is a bouncer for a club, its very orignal and funny enough Rockstar made a fantastic Biker game that was orignal rather then Derp Sliver making a sh*tty one!I played over a 1000 hours of GTA IV back in 2008, I OWN IT ON DISC along with steam, however during the time of this review I haven't instailed it on steam so I can review it. I got it in a bundle with GTA IV for £6!More weapons then the orignal GTA IV, more cars and stuff and you get two stories for a cheaper price.Worth the price, get it.			"

I Installed that POS, but I STILL couldn't play it because of some random error.SOMEHOW, I got it working by gonig through its files... started the campaign... the game asks me to create a GFWL account (even an offline one), in order to same my progress. I sigh, but, wanting to play, I press ""Yes"", in order to create one... AND IT CRASHES, EVERY TIME I DO IT.Everyone says PC gaming is sooo great, because you can play all past games, without issue. That is a load of bull****. Guess what? The pirated version works like a charm :)			"

												[**Contains pr*fanity, if you are sensitive to words and can see through asterisks, this review may not be for you**]I'm sure the game is great (I liked GTA IV a lot on 360 but never got around to playing the expansions).That being said, f*ck Games for WIndows Live. First, I can't run the game without crashing, then I finally get GFWL working (the step I missed when giving up on Dark Souls months ago (which I still haven't played) was apparently restarting my computer after installing the correct version of GFWL which had to be obtained manually online (why microsoft made an operating system that doesn't work properly out of the box with the stupid stupid GFWL thing that they created (and should be ashamed of) is beyond me).So, some number of days ago I got the stupid GFWL thing working so that I could play the game, what's this I see immediately? 'Sign in to some special ""Rockstar social club"" thing to play online'... um... ok... sure, I mean I didn't have to do any of this stupid pointless stuff when I played on console... but sure...So I make the account and think, well at least it's not like that stupid thing in Dark Souls (which I ran once to see if it worked) where I had to create a windows live profile to even save the game (foreshadowing... creepy).So I start up the expansion and, about 10 seconds in, realize that the keyboard controls are unplayable, at least from what I'm used to, I honestly don't know how anyone could play this with a keyboard, but whatever, I've needed a better controller for a while now so I ordered a 360 knockoff from ebay and forgot about GTA for a while.So the controller comes in and I get around to playing GTA, first, somewhat of an aside, I go to the graphics section and see a benchmark. Oh neat! I think to myself, I can run a benchmark and see if I want to try and push any of the recomended settings a bit higher, good deal. The benchmark runs to completion and then...PC : EFLC.exe has stopped working. Me: Oh well, it was a nice thought while it lasted.Anyway, I forget the benchmark and start the game, seems pretty good so far, kind of a long winded intro and they introduce a follow the leader mechanic which looks like it's going to be kind of annoying, oh look a safehouse... that's cool, look at all of the things I can do, I'll have to check that out...Game: Autosave feature has failed, you need to sign in to a LIVE-enabled account to saveMe: Of course, I knew expecting there to only be one account that I need to play this game was too much to ask for... nevermind the fact that I never needed to sign in to live when playing on the console, and nevermind that I'm just trying to SAVE MY GAME IN A SINGLE PLAYER GAME MODE WITHOUT SIGNING INTO AN ONLINE SERVICE. Whatever, you win this round M$.Naturally I can't be bothered to remember what e-mails I've used for various Live accounts in the past (i've had several) so I decide to make a new one from scratch.Wait, let me back up. You see, before I can get a Live account, I first need a Microsoft account for it to make the Live account from. OK, I'll bite:Name: 	First: F*kYouAsswh*lesIJustWantToF*kingPlayGTA	Last: ThisIsSoF*kingStupidF*kEveryOneOfYou[Note: asterisks added for this public review, the misspellings are because, apparently, if you're name contains profanity it can't be used for a M$ account, even though it's a required field.]Username: f*ckGamesForWindowsLiveWith@BigRusty.Pole[again the asterisk is mine, the correct spelling of the word this time is also not a typo]Password: *****[I guess I'll keep this one to myself for posterity, but, fun fact, originally it contained the word f**k, which was also set as the first name at the time (my form went through many revisions), the first error on trying to submit a form I saw was 'password cannot contain your name... hmm...

I win!! I broke your system, I broke your system *does a dance*Anyway, yes, I had p*ssed [Edit: really guys? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is a bad word?] them off, I'm not entirely sure how or what they were going to use for my username, but I ended up with the account ID/name: TendedFever6 which I guess is cute, but I digress.So I go back to GTA, and I enter in the oh-so-wonderful e-mail address and type in my password and enter in the key that Steam gave me (that it finally decided to ask for) and blah blah blah and what's this, did it work? am I done?Live: LIVE needs an update!Me: God, of course, whatever, just shut up and do it, I don't care, just have your way with me if you must, just please, don't hurt me again.Live: Live is updating, this may require restarting your computer.Me: You better not restart my f*cking computer you piece of sh*tLive: Do do do, I am updating, do do doMe: I swear to god, if you restart my f*cking computer...Live: Guess what! you need to restart this game for the update thingy to work, so do that because we hate you.Me: You realize I haven't saved? The game took me like 15 min in until it showed the first safehouse before prompting the autosave (or showing a bed) and I can't save now because you won't let me until I sign in, and immediately after you let me sign in you told me that there was an update that I needed or I would be signed out, and then I said OK update and so you updated and need to close my game, which I haven't saved.So I resign myself to go back to the game, turn off the autosave feature because I'm soft-locked with it enabled, make one last attempt to find some way to manually save even though I know it's futile, and then I close the game.Then Microsoft does it's stupid update on it's stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥ piece of software that's just as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ after the update as it was beforehand.And then I launch the game. And then I sign into my profile, and then I'm logged in and it seems to work. I start up the expansion, it starts to load... and then I press Alt+F4 because I'm not in the mood to replay the 10-15 minutes that I lost, because I'm not in the mood to look at a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GFWL game right now, and I feel dirty after what I've just had to do to be able to save a single player campaign.GTA is a great franchise, GFWL is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Unfortunately they used that piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥to port this game, so ♥♥♥♥ it and ♥♥♥♥ Microsoft for making it the most appealing option.If you run Windows 8 (I'm not proud, the PC came with it, but that's another rant) be ready for a potential headache if you haven't already figured out the whole 'getting games like Dark Souls and GTA IV to run because GFWL likes to error and fail by default'. Also, if you're like me and don't want to create yet another mostly-legitimate account for something you don't have any plan to use for much anything else at any time in the near future (but who doesn't have an XBox, right? maybe people who had the system die on them and didn't bother to get a replacement because there's other consoles out there that don't have a stupid high RROD fail rate? nah, that's crazy talk).Again, I hear the expansions are great, but get 'em on PS3 or something, this is the type of thing that should just not be encouraged.Anyway, I had a fun waste of an evening and decided to waste even more time making this wonderful rant of a post. To anyone who made it this far, congrats and have a nice day.Edit: Formatting.			"

No, who could beat RS on that subject?But they tell better stories and provide interesting and in case of SR 4 genius spins on thegameplay formular.Coolest sandbox, still the newest GTA your machine can handle or still can handle -whatever, is GTA.I did recommend the game WHEN it worked (which might be a cr****d version) but today at least tripple check if your computer is in the unlikely spot where it could run GTA IV & DLCS			"

												It's fun to see the stories from GTA 4 and Episodes crossing like this. Up till now I've finished Ballad of Gay Tony and one thing I have to say is that it fixes some issues I had with the base GTA 4 - namely, when restarting the missions, they start from the point in time when the mission really begins, leaving out driving to the place, etc. Also, there are checkpoints in longer missions. Because of that I didn't notice what seemed like a bug in the main game - that even though the mission is restarted, you don't get back ammo and armour. It's shorter, of course, and funny, which is also a nice change after the main story.			"

Это пак из 2 дополнений для Grand Theft Auto IV не требующие оригинала, то есть - это отдельные игры от оригинала дополнения у наследовали, название и геймплей, движок и плохую оптимизацию при порте на PC платформу. Сюжет рассказывает о: байкере Джонни Клейбеце и о телохранителе Энтони ""Голубого Тони"" Принца которого зовут Луиз Лопез,он работает на бизнесмэна работающего в сфере развлечений. За Джонни нам предлогают сыграть 25 миссий, плюс дофига побочных заданий таких, как ""Войны группировок, угон машин"" и так далее. За Луиза 28 миссий, плюс дофига побочных заданий таких, как ""бейзджампинг, управлениями в ночное время клубами"" и можно тусить в клубах и при удачном с течении обстоятельств. Луизу может чего-нибудь перепадет именно в ""этом"" смысле. Игра хорошая, моя оценка 92/100.			"

												TL:DR -> see last lineFor all the people that think GFWL has to do with saves: it doesn't. Those people have just no idea. GFWL was NEVER a cloud saving system, that means that it DID NOT delete your saves, NOR it makes you unable to save at the moment. The game is totally fine in single player, in fact I booted up just this week to have some car fun. And guess what, I downloaded it from the steam library, launched, quit, imported my old save files (from 2010) I had on the HDD and put it in the right folder, launched the game again, and took from exactly where I left my character in 2010. GFWL *is not* connected to the savefiles, they are on the HDD. If you are not clever enough to understand that you should have backed up the savegame files before uninstalling the game last time, DON'T write reviews which are not helpful for the other users.I am speaking about single player. So: SINGLE PLAYER is totally fine and save system is fine too. I am not sure about multiplayer, but yes, it would be understandable that the online portion is totally failing at the moment. ***But single player is 100% the way it was before.***			"

												""This port seems to be a higgldy piggldy mess of cobbled together trash i'm afraid.""Before i attempted to sink my teeth into this game,  was bludgeoned with several issues to get the game started.That is: Before you play this game, you must have a GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE account to actually start it, inwhich that is already crap, but if you want further♥♥♥♥♥♥in the bowl, then a fresh serving of a old version with thegame that autoinstalls, so you have to clean up the old ""GFWL"" and install the new one off the website.

Bloody hell rockstar, look if you're going to do a port. Make it a goodone don't just slapdash it together with the drunkest of your employees and have the high as hell PR department say""GERD JERB""... Overall. It's an embarrasing port, thats a blemish of a actually fun collection of the two gta 4 dlc's.But drop the idea of playing it on PC. As a I7, with 8gb of ram and a 2gig card you'll still be lucky to play it all on highsettings.Basically: You dun ♥♥♥♥d up pc ports. Waiting to get GTA 5. Then i'll see if they have redeemed themselves... "

												This game runs fairly better than the base game, which is already one reason to play it. Each part of the game has its own story, and both are great. Multiplayer with mods is what makes this awesome though.			"

												Spent 14 hours with Luis (Ballad of Gay Tony), then 7 hours with Johnny (Lost and Damned) - which is the wrong order chronologically.Doesn't add to the GTA IV experience, other than fizzling out the ending with weaker characters and attempting to tie up 'what happened to the diamonds' which didn't really matter in GTA IV as much as the surprisingly human experience of Niko.Ultimately, just play GTA IV and skip Episodes from Liberty City.

												Lots of initial problems. Bundled with crappy rockstar software that does not work from the get go. Problem:When I turn on the game through Steam shows up: Log in Social Club When I click play, nothing happens. Solution:""Download and install the latest version of Games for Windows - LIVE ("" GFWL "") PC Client. The version installed with this older game is no longer compatible with modern operating systems.You can get this from the microsoft (xbox) website. Downloading it from there is the only thing that works.EDIT: STILL not working.  Now i am getting: failed to start application [2000] -> 0x000002E4EDIT 2:Set all the exe files in the install directory to compatability with windows xp. Installed update to windows live gaming.I finally got it working. Game is fun for short periods of time. It does not hold my attention like some other games do. Negatively ranked due to all the initial problems and stress and having to install extra programs just to get the game working. I would only recommend this on consoles.			"

												I loved the GTA series until they came out with the money hording game GTA 5 and especially playing their PC ports, their PC ports are laughable pathetic. I've played about 3-5 hours in the game and in that time frame, I've literally crashed +10 times and now when I try to play it's saying I'm not connected to the internet, oh, did I mention, you need Windows Live to even play it and have to be logged in at ALL times to even continue your saved game?♥♥♥♥ this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port.

												Great game compared to what people say. Even though it was a step back from GTA San Andreas on some points, like the removal of planes, it took GTA to the next era by adding Online modes like freemode (Which was a lot of fun back in the day) and improving the graphics. It improved on GTA IV by adding 2 new characters with their only seperate and unique stories and added new features like parachutes (Which for whatever reason are only in The Ballad of Gay Tony and not in The Lost and Damned which is a bit strange) and new vechicles and strangely enough the vechicles that appear in each story, don't appear in the other one which doesn't really make sense. Both stories and characters are unique and completely different from eachother.  Would recommend for fans of GTA. It is a game worth getting.			"

												Lots of initial problems. Bundled with crappy rockstar software that does not work from the get go. Problem:When I turn on the game through Steam shows up: Log in Social Club When I click play, nothing happens. Solution:""Download and install the latest version of Games for Windows - LIVE ("" GFWL "") PC Client. The version installed with this older game is no longer compatible with modern operating systems.You can get this from the microsoft (xbox) website. Downloading it from there is the only thing that works.EDIT: STILL not working.  Now i am getting: failed to start application [2000] -> 0x000002E4EDIT 2:Set all the exe files in the install directory to compatability with windows xp. Installed update to windows live gaming.I finally got it working. Game is fun for short periods of time. It does not hold my attention like some other games do. Negatively ranked due to all the initial problems and stress and having to install extra programs just to get the game working. I would only recommend this on consoles.			"

												I actually played this game on Windows 7 and it was a very fun experience (especially the ""The Ballad of Gay Tony"" episode). However, after updating to Windows 10 I stopped being able to play it. Nevermind the online guides asking you to uninstall and reinstall this or that Games for Windows Live version, Visual C++ 2005 or .Net 3.5 (I tried them all) - it doesn't work on Windows 10. Forget about it. Save your money or buy something else on Steam. Fortunately Microsoft will make Windows 10 backward compatible with whatever piece of legacy software that is conflicting with the game laucher, or Rockstar will release a patch that will make the game work. Until then, spend your money on other game.			"

												A great add on to GTA IV. This is how DLC should be done (even though it is technically not dlc since you don't need the base game to play it). It's like a brand new game. A ♥♥♥♥ton of more wepons and addons that GTA IV should of came with. Parachutes, AA12's (with explosive ammo), gernade launcher, sticky bombs, new cars and so much more. The story of both TLAD and TBOGT are both good and actually have effort put into them. Personally, I think TBOGT has a better and more intresting storyline but they're both great. This would be the ultimate bargain if Rockstar would of not of ditched GTA IV and EFLC once GTA V came out since this game(s) still have the cancerous tumor which is GFWL attached on it like a blood sucking leech. Also, the multiplayer is a lost cause at this point. Since Rockstar completely abandoned GTA IV multiplayer, it is a broken mess and if you do get it working after configuring the game's files, close to nobody is even on multiplayer. (atleast in my experience)Overall, I would recommend EFLC in a heart beat.♥♥♥♥♥♥ If this game was price at $60 i'd still buy it just for BOGT since it's such an amazing improvement over GTA IV. Totally Reccomend.			"

												Despiste being one of the best Open World games, GTA IV / EFLC has also one of the WORST ports ever on PC.(use these commands to make the game run/load properly: -availablevidmem 60 -norestrictions -nomemrestrict)Introducing the main problems that you will face:1 - Games for Windows LIVE. You know? That s***ty Microsoft thing? Its in this game.2 - Social Club. Because reasons. If you have to create a LIVE account, why not making a Social Club account too?3 - Even if you have the best hardware for Gaming, you will find the most s***ty feature ever implemented in a game, and it works awfully bad. Presenting the ""not enough memory available"" crap, AKA ""screw this im unnistalling this game, Ive searched the internet for 3 hours trying to fix this crap"". Even if you have some of the best PC hardware, youre not safe from this, and GTA IV / EFLC will inform you most of the times that your hardware is weak and it only has 55MB of VRAM available (even if you have 4GB of VRAM) (you can also try to remove the restrictions but the game wont load most of the times, it will only work if you successfully make the game acknowledge that you have *insert your VRAM here*)			"

												DO NOT BUY FOR WINDOWS 10... game is so broken its not funny. -Problems with the Social Club EFLC launcher, -leads to reinstalling Gaming for Windows Live, -which leads to microsofts website continuously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on you saying ""GFWL is retired, this page cant be found"", -which leads to people telling you ""ok, then just do launch commands, its superezpz broheim"",-which leads to you not know what the ♥♥♥♥ you're doing and typing in♥♥♥♥♥♥that breaks your game further.-which leads to same people telling you to do launch commands saying ""l0lcopter you broke ur own game and want help now?! l0lface ur ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as ♥♥♥♥ing hammered ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥kill yourself"".-which now leads to me coming here, warning others of the unforseen ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that awaits if they buy this game with Windows10. If you're a pc savy individual that doesnt mind really working to get your games to run, then go for it.If you're average Joe Blow like me that just wants to play some ♥♥♥♥in GTA without jumping through hoops, buy it for console.

E.g. when I tried to make changes in options, the settings kept bouncing back to the default value. When I tried to start game, it just kept making slide show (I couldn't tell if it was a loading screen or something else). Basically, it's the worst experience ever on Steam.			"

												This game is stupid. The controls are overly touchy when driving to where you can't keep from dinging another car and thus getting the police after you. I played for awhile, deleted it, and when I tried to download it again, the stupid thing wouldn't even load. Any game that requires you to log in through a completely different service just to save is simply not worth the time to download. Paying for this is one of the worst decisions I have ever made.			"

And games for windows live isn't a thing any more so no multiplayer. Whats more the graphics look someone was drawing while taking a s*&% and their inspiration was the product of their trip to the bathroom.

												(Mostly pasted from my GTA IV review but slightly edited)Worth it for multiplayer and at 5 or so bucks but that's about it. I used to love this and the original game (Come on GTA V, it's not too late for single-player expansion packs...) but it has aged surprisingly horribly.Pros:+Euphoria physics are beyond awesome and ragdoll is the best in any game ever (apart from RDR and Max Payne 3 of course. Thank gosh for a mod that brings it back in GTA V)+Though controversial, I personally love the vehicle physics. Sets it apart from the other GTA's. Glad it went back to more arcadey with GTA V though+Characters are mostly likeable+Voice-acting is superb like usual from Rockstar+Melee system is fun+Great American satire+Often humourous (it's GTA...)+Story isn't as serious as GTA IV, more GTA style+Addition of checkpoints in missions unlike GTA IV+Good length for both expansion packsCons:-Graphics aged horribly due to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ art-style, lack of colours etc. (it's not even that old...)-Barely a problem at all, you get used to it real quick but the vehicle camera angle is kinda whack-GFWL is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Not so bad though, just say offline which people seem dumb enough to not figure out-Not much to do in the world-Shooting is sorta ♥♥♥♥♥♥ feeling-Sound is forgettable, lackluster gun sounds etc.-Far less content than San Andreas and Vice City-Music is dogshit-Horrible optimizationSound: 5/10Graphics: 2/10Gameplay: 6/10Content/Replayability: 4/10Overall: 7/10The expansion packs are slightly better than GTA IV original, but honestly this game has aged horribly and yet it's only 9 years old. Not worth it at full price. Get it on sale.			"

												Bought this on sale for around £6 if memory serves. Just about the best value you could hope for. Two full length games in one. And GTA4 games at that.Runs slightly better on my system than GTA4 too, which is a bonus. New radio stations are nice, new vehicles and weapons are excellent, and the new stories are very well written, acted and told.As per usual you find it impossible to feel anything for the character you play, as they are both just scuzzy criminals with no morals and would kill their best friends for money, even though they keep going on about how important friends are.Gay Tony is by far the best of the two, with an awesome new helicopter gunship, and a fantastic auto-shotgun with explosive ammo that smashes vehicles to peices with each shot. Hilarity obviously ensues when you do this to a police car.I havent played MP yet, but it seems to be just the same thing as in GTA4, so if you liked that you will like this.All in all a great game.

												I never written a review before, but I'm so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I had to write one.Game runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ even after the new update and with some tricks.  Having it on a gtx 1070 and a 6500, I thought this game would be somewhat playable, but was I ♥♥♥♥ing wrong.  Have to make it look worse than the 360 version just to make it stable, but it still dips.  It hits the cpu hard(thats why it stutters so much) and it barely uses the gpu.  The framerate stays high, but the stuttering is way too common that it makes me sick.  Did I mention that it has no anti-aliasing?I loved this game on the 360, but I dont love it enough to endure this piece of a turd port.I knew this was one of the worst ports ever made, but I didn't know it was this awful.

												The extension to GTA IV which weaves in to and out of the storyline of the original brings a surprising amount of detail and new content to the series with new storylines, items, vehicles and events throughout the city.

This one follows what's become the typical GTA hierarchy; the music is the best part, followed by the story, then the driving, then the combat. Unfortunately, the story wasn't that great in this one. It started out pretty good but really unraveled at the end, seemingly just to rush the story to a conclusion. I enjoyed being on a chopper basically the entire time, and Liberty Rock Radio was damn good as expected, but other sandbox series have really left the gameplay of GTA in the dust. Hopefully Rockstar North realizes that and really tightens it up for V.			"

												There are games that are good. There are games that are great and then there is this game. If you have played any of the gta games you know what it is about. But here in TBOGT you really can connect with Tony and the other characters. You build a bond between you. I really like this. Since it is not the unsensible side of the game that you hear about but the exact opposite. You are not doing it to get drugs and cars but just about being at the wrong place at the wrong time. and there is the lost and the damn which is pretty much all about shouting rival gangs and ride your bike. Good ending on both of the games though. Prefer TBOGT ending over TLAD.			"

												When playing GTA4 one should not avoid GTA: Episodes From Liberty City. We are back in Liberty City, but not as Nico. Instead we jump into the shoes of Johny Klebitz, a Vice President of the biker gang ""The Lost"", and into the shoes of Luis Fernando Lopez, a close friend of ""Gay"" Tony, who is one of the major players in town, who owns several night clubs. Both stories tells a story set in Liberty City from a different perspective. When put together with Nico's story, GTA4 finally comes to it's conclusion. Johny, Luis and Nico are three great characters in GTA4, and it is entertaining to experience all their stories and the outcomes of those stories.Gameplay is pretty much the same as with normal GTA4, so if you had problems with helicopters... then really don't expect a difference...In the end though GTA4 is amazing and that feeling is only boosted with Episodes From Liberty City			"

												在GTA5发售之际，通了TBOGT的主线剧情，总的来说没有TLAD和正传的剧情来得震撼人心，但是也足够合格了（我喜欢大团圆的结局）。剧情对于自由城上流社会生活做了非常丰富的描写，人物性格也非常鲜明，疯狂的中东地产大亨Yusuf让我想起了正传里的Bruce，不过他更加丧心病狂（Bruce反而在TBOGT里显得很规矩，大概是兄长Mori在的缘故），但是为人重情义，帮了主角Luis不少忙。本作的任务也堪称GTA4之最，游戏性几近GTASA（跳伞真的很好玩）。总而言之，该资料片对于GTA4原作是个非常好的补充。			"

												I would break the hands of the guy who thought out the helicopter controls for PC. Even after reconfiguring (while it deliberately and inconsistently overwrites other keybinds) it's a chore. My brain starts to hurt when I think about it. Controller is a must it seems, yay consoles!			"

												A little better optimized than the main game, and it adds better multiplayer support and two single player campaigns which co-exist within the same space and time from Niko's adventure.It also adds many more guns, character skins, vehicles and makes handling better, adding also more weather and better ambiance. Worth buying.			"

												Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City delivers two games based on the world of Liberty City. Both games -- The LOST & Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony -- offer expansive, story-based experiences inside this wild and dangerous city. The package does not require a copy of the original Grand Theft Auto IV to play.THE LOST AND DAMNED -- Johnny is a veteran member of The Lost, a notorious biker gang. Johnny has been creating BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES for The Lost in Liberty City, but his first loyalty must be to the patch he wears on his back and to Billy Grey, the club's President. However, when Billy returns from rehab hell-bent on bloodshed and debauchery, Johnny finds himself in the middle of a vicious turf war with rival gangs for control of a city torn apart by violence and corruption. Can the brotherhood survive?THE BALLAD OF GAY TONY -- Grand Theft Auto IV's second downloadable episode injects Liberty City with an overdose of guns, glitz, and grime. As Luis Lopez, PART-TIME hoodlum and full-time assistant to legendary nightclub impresario Tony Prince (aka ""Gay Tony""), players will struggle with the competing loyalties of family and friends, and with the uncertainty about who is real and who is fake in a world in which everyone has a price.

												A weird occasion, but it is that case when DLC is actually better than the main game. tBoGT goes from strict realism to crazy fun with stealing train cars, racing with nitro and jumping to a taking off plane from a motorbike. This one somewhy reminded me of Vice City, with it's gloss, sunshine and one particularly eccentric person. Yusuf Amir, son of a wealthy Arab businessman, very much reminded me of Diaz. The plot is great and fun, with lots of new interesting characters, as well as cameos from the original game. The relations between Lois (the main character) and Gay Tony (his boss) are a very well-presented story of a friendship. If you own a GTA IV, or you just consider yourself a GTA fan, this one is a must-buy.			"

												I am fiscally minded with video game purchases, so naturally I found the complete GTA IV trilogy on sale and bought it knowing what I was getting.  IV was great, but the feeling of restriction at the start bugged me, so when fired up this game I feared such pains again.  Not so, as I learned.  You get two storylines, both having the things that made GTA IV fun, and new stuff as well.  But what really got me was the fact that the world was wide open from the start, no strings attached!  Although missions like to congregate in certain places at certain points, the feeling of freedom is a welcome feeling to me.  If you want Liberty City at it's best, get this game, it's a great addition to the GTA series.     It should also be worth mentioning that most (if not all) GTA IV mods will work with these games, so if you want to cause even more chaos you shouldn't have trouble making that happen.			"

												Absolutely awful port, the game runs terrible because Rockstar doesn't understand GPU vs CPU. Additionally the controls on the helicopter are incredibly frustrating. Keys can only be in two ♥♥♥♥ing positions, pressed or not. Yet because Rockstar doesn't know that it becomes impossible to accurately shoot things below you, such as boats in one of the very first few missions of The Ballad. Difficult games can be good, but games that are hard due to bad controls aren't fun.			"

												Ekipa iz Rockstara kao da je sve zanimljivo ostavila za epizode za GTA4. Daju novi pogled na originalnu pricu iz GTA4, jer igrate sa novim protagonistima, a takodje se vrti i neka njihova licna prica. Misije su mnogo raznovrsnije, i moram da napomenem da mi je 20-ak misija svake pojedinacne epzode donelo vise zabave nego ceo GTA4 sa skoro 90 misija. Mnogo vise humora, crnog i ne-crnog, doprinose kvalitetu. I dalje nema RPG elemenata, ali valjda ce se te opcije vratiti u narednom GTA.			"

I do not want anything to do with this, but that OK because it broken anyway. So unless you want to put hours of your life into actually starting the f***ing game, do not buy it until they get rid of windows live.			"

												DLC well-aligned with GTA spirit.Episodes from Liberty city is something we were all expecting when we finished GTA IV. We were left with that feeling of something missing, gnawing at us, not knowing exactly what we wanted: this was it.  Those of us who have played the series from the beginning know that it carries a somewhat serious story that is permeated with a silly, fun, and exciting sense of humor under the surface. What was lacking from the base game was restored with this excellent DLC.The first episode consists of The Ballad of Gay Tony, which takes place in the same Liberty City as the base game. The main protagonist is Luis Lopez, a Dominican-American who is the co-owner of a club with partner Gay Tony.  The episode is much faster-paced than the base game, which is understandable, as the episode only lasts around 15 hours if you do a lot of the side missions and mess around like I did.  This means that missions progress the story rapidly, with large, life-changing events taking place in a short period of time.  I found this extremely enjoyable, as many of the missions are borderline plausible, over-the-top, ridiculous fun.  The voice acting is commendable, and every character is realized in a totally believable way. Luis deals with problems at home, past relationships, and his volatile partner consistently throughout the game. You get to fly new vehicles which allow for a large degree of destruction.  New and exotic weapons are unlocked periodically, and they also help spice up the gameplay.  This was a great addition, since being stuck with the same guns as the forty hour base game would probably have made the gunplay stale. The shooting and cover mechanics carry over from the base game, and they are still .  I still think the shooting mechanics could have been polished up a bit from the original. The story is evenly paced and has only a few irritating missions, and difficulty spikes are kept to a minimum. I can comfortably say that The Ballad of Gay Tony is a worthwhile addition to the GTA IV expirience.Now, the second episode, called The Lost and Damned, delivers a similar expirience with a few drawbacks pertaining mostly to the story.  I played the Gay Tony episode first, and I was left with a great sense of satisfaction after the conclusion. Playing this after also left me with a sense of satisfaction, but to a lesser degree.  I liked the story almost all the way through, and then it wound down extremely fast near the end, leaving me wanting more.  The game really should have included more missions exploring the background of the gang, and also more commentary related to the gang's past.  I felt that a lot of the dialogue included mentions of past events that were not developed in any way. Some of the characters were also unlikeable, including the protagonist, who can seem bland at times compared to Luis Lopez. Another thing that bothers me throughout the entire game is the muted, dark color palette and grainy film effect that is present in the entire game. I can understand that the developers were shooting for a sixties biker theme, but the effect can get annoying after a few hours. Negatives aside, the game carries over a lot of the good things from Gay Tony, including the fast-paced weapon progressions, over-the-top missions (less so compared to BOGT), and excellent voice acting. This is still a solid addition to the base game, and features memorable characters and missions, although muted in full-blown silliness and adrenaline compared to TBOGT. This DLC pack was something that I did not expect when GTA IV was out.  The pratice of selling DLC was becoming common practice around release date, but Rockstar has never made smaller, riskier pieces of extra content on their games before.  For a first try, they really got a lot of things right, and overall, this DLC package is a must play if you are a fan of the series.  Especially at the current price, you cannot miss the memorable expiriences in both episodes. I suggest you play The Lost and Damned first, and save the best for last.			"

												This game it extremely fun and i do like it, but it doesn't work with windows 8.1. If you are impatient and have windows 8.1 do not buy this game because it took me around 3 hours to get it working, because when you've downloaded Rockstar's patch you then have to get past games for windows live (GFWL), which is one of the most poorly designed things of all time, and you need it if you want to save the game. But if you are willing to do all of this then the game itself is very fun and there are plenty of mods out there to mess about with, so it is worth it in the long run. Hope this helps.			"

												“Man was born for society. However little He may be attached to the World, He never can wholly forget it, or bear to be wholly forgotten by it. Disgusted at the guilt or absurdity of Mankind, the Misanthrope flies from it: He resolves to become an Hermit, and buries himself in the Cavern of some gloomy Rock. While Hate inflames his bosom, possibly He may feel contented with his situation: But when his passions begin to cool; when Time has mellowed his sorrows, and healed those wounds which He bore with him to his solitude, think you that Content becomes his Companion? Ah! no, Rosario. No longer sustained by the violence of his passions, He feels all the monotony of his way of living, and his heart becomes the prey of Ennui and weariness. He looks round, and finds himself alone in the Universe: The love of society revives in his bosom, and He pants to return to that world which He has abandoned. Nature loses all her charms in his eyes: No one is near him to point out her beauties, or share in his admiration of her excellence and variety. Propped upon the fragment of some Rock, He gazes upon the tumbling waterfall with a vacant eye, He views without emotion the glory of the setting Sun. Slowly He returns to his Cell at Evening, for no one there is anxious for his arrival; He has no comfort in his solitary unsavoury meal: He throws himself upon his couch of Moss despondent and dissatisfied, and wakes only to pass a day as joyless, as monotonous as the former.” ― Matthew Gregory Lewis, The Monk			"

												Runs like sh*t just like gta 4 but also like gta 4 i was able to put up with it because of how good the dlc's are. I love the references and tie ins to gta 4 all three stories feel connected its great. Both DLC's are pretty short around 6 hours each if you are just doing the missions which is fine you can't really expect more from standalone DLC.Ballad of gay tony in particular is the best thing to come out of gta 4. A lot of the missions are so crazy and fun to play and luis is also the best protaginist out of the three because he's the most interesting and the most badass. Lost and damned is good but it just doesn't compare to gta 4 and gay tony mainly because i dislike johnny as a character and the missions are just not as fun.The Lost and Damned 7/10 (Good) GTA 4 8/10 (Great)The Ballad of Gay Tony 9/10 (Amazing)			"

Some extra cars and bikes are also very welcome, the mission rating system in TBoGT not so much (especially for completionists). It's also worth noting that the engine in TBoGT got couple enhancements making the game more beautiful (don't expect a huge difference thou).

												A weird occasion, but it is that case when DLC is actually better than the main game. tBoGT goes from strict realism to crazy fun with stealing train cars, racing with nitro and jumping to a taking off plane from a motorbike. This one somewhy reminded me of Vice City, with it's gloss, sunshine and one particularly eccentric person. Yusuf Amir, son of a wealthy Arab businessman, very much reminded me of Diaz. The plot is great and fun, with lots of new interesting characters, as well as cameos from the original game. The relations between Lois (the main character) and Gay Tony (his boss) are a very well-presented story of a friendship.

												Since it's not really a game, but expansion packs, I'll use at the beginning, the same ""performance issues"" part of the review, then change the ending.The huge disappointment in this game is due terrible optimization, sounds fun that this old GTA IV runs terrible compared to my new GTA V, even GTA IV having weak graphics even maxed out compared to GTA V, sounds that Rockstar did something lazy only to say that they released it for PC, people will say that console's version was better, but I played it also in consoles and the game looks terrible with frame stuttering even being most of the time at horrible 30FPS.This game doesn't have a decent plot as GTA IV has, the story seems amateur, specially TBoGT that focuses too much into disgusting characters, if it was a separatedly GTA game, it will be two of the worst ones.

												Gta 4 and Episodes from Liberty City are my favorite games. Great story, great city, great car physics, great freedom. The only flaw is the optimization of PC version. It could be and have to be really better. And don't doubt about buying DLC - Episodes from Liberty City, they are sometimes better than original game. TBoGT is far more crazy and has a lot of freedom than main game: choppers, gang wars, more destructive missions =)			"

												Great games! Doesn't require GTA IV as a base game so you can get these yourself!Both stories can give a little something that caters to almost every type of GTA player. I personally liked Ballad of Gay Tony more, as the characters were far more interesting and the whole ""neon"" theme is more up my alley (just my opinion).Either way, worth $20 for sure and this game goes on sale a lot so if you are lower than this, keep an eye out on your Wishlist! Must have for any fan of the GTA series or Sandbox Game Series! (Liberty City is a really realistic Carbon copy of New York, and the city is just as (if not more) engaging as Los Santos in GTA V.

												With the euphoria engine, the games (IV, Bogt, Tlad) are so much more fun than the previous versions of GTA. You can create movies with the editor and it can be ""youtube quality"" or 720p or 1080p. The length of the story in these games is really great and it offers really mindblowing action and drama. When the mainstory is complete the game has a great multiplayer to offer and you can deathmatch or race or just hang out and cause chaos in the liberty city.			"

												GTA IV Marked the beginning, and Episodes From Liberty City Opens the Next Two Chapters of this new Era of GTA.The Lost and The Dammned brings us into the shoes of Patriotic Young Middle Age Biker Johnny Klebitz, from the start you feel like part of the gang, you ride your Metallic Stallion down the highway with your brothers in tow, banter and insults fly as you cruise around the city, you couldn't feel more at home behind the handbars until now.The Ballad of Gay Tony shows us the highlife of Liberty Cities Posh,  Rich and the Stupid, as we roll into the sneakers of Luis Lopez, and we see the return of more of the sillyness GTA IV denied us in IV, Solid Gold Helicopters you say? SWAT Tanks? they're all here, along with the Fast Cars, Fast Women, and Good Guns.Episodes from Liberty City fits snuggly into the already established Story of IV involving Coccaine Diamonds and Rivalry, you haven't had the full experiance till you've played these GemsEpisodes of Liberty City gets 8/10			"

Not as much the down town night club kind of person like Lewis in TBGT. Really glad that I purchased it. Now it is time to get a computer that can handle GTA V and start playing it. Playing online with friends is the greatest; although, since GTAV has come out, there is not many people in the lobies to play with. That was surprising to me.			"

												Having beaten GTA4 I can assume this one kicks♥♥♥♥♥ as well.I toyed with it a bit to make sure it worked and I'll write more on the actual game once I've had a chance to play it. But I'm writing this to offer a bit of help with anyone having trouble with the graphics memory setting being maxed out despite actually having enough RAM to run the game.This is what worked for me:IN your computer's program files folders, go to  \Steam\steamapps\common\Grand Theft Auto IV Episodes from Liberty City\EFLC Make a  text file  using Windows Notepad and write  -availablevidmem 14.0  in it, nothing else, and save it to that folder (I don't know why 14.0 works for me, but it does, fiddle with it if it's too much or too little)Then, right-click the  LaunchEFLC  and click  Send to > Desktop (create shortcut)  Now, on the Desktop shortcut, right-click and go to  Properties In the  Target:  after the  ""... Liberty City\EFLC\LaunchEFLC.exe""  type in  -availablevidmem 14.0  hit  Apply  and close it out. Now, from the desktop shortcut, right-click and  Run as Administrator  and hopefully you should be able to adjust the Graphics Memory in the game options and play the game.(Edit Note: Once you've established that the game works, it can be launched from Steam. Also, this game kicks so much ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥it's ridiculous.)I hope this helps. If not, there's a billion work-arounds out there and I had to figure this out by trying all of them and using the one that worked for me. Good luck.			"

												The episodes from Liberty City are alot like the expansions to the original Half Life game, both add a lot to the story of the original game, and add a good deal of new content as well.The Lost MC Campaign: This story follows the Lost MC biker gang as their second in command (the player) is trying to keep the gang alive and prospering while the current leader is using the members for his own purposes. The levels throughout this offer alot of action and an interesting mechanic of staying in formation with your other bikers when riding. It reveals other perspectives to the main story of GTA 4 and gives plenty of backstory on characters that were not touched to much before. There are also a few new weapons in this and some fun motorcycles to ride, which oddly enough were easier to control than in GTA 4.The Ballad of Gay Tony: This campaign shows you the life and empire of the club owner Gay Tony and his right hand man Luis (the plater). Everything from this type of campaign is present from drugs, to shootouts, and club adventures. This campaign does a decent job of exploring a few select characters backgrounds and offers tons of new weapons to try out throughout the game. The missions in this campaign are a lot more fun as the introduction of the parachute is present allowing you to jump out of helicopters and high rise buildings to escape danger. I would consider this campaign to be alot more fun gameplay wise than The Lost MC, while The Lost MC offers more story wise.Both campaigns are phenominal, and short enough to keep you entertained while playing and long enough to enjoy them all the way though.

												The Ballad Of Gay Tony Review:GTA Liberty City Episodes TBOGT was a Fabulous DLC. It brought many new features into the already amazing GTA 4, new features consisting of New Radio Stations, New Weapons, Parachute, Vehicles, Night Clubs & Dancing etc... The storyline itself was excellent it tied in perfectly with the GTA 4 Setting and it was amazing seeing how they interconnected, the protagonist himself is quite awesome, he has a big heart and also gets his hands dirty if necessary, Tony's character is also great to watch because your basically his babysitter and best friend. All the characters you interact with are memorable especially the protagonist and Tony, the missions themself are fun & entertaining to play.Overall TBOGT improved upon the fabulous GTA 4 in every way. The Gameplay is fun and will bring many hours of entertainment, The Story is Beautiful and fun to play out. I enjoyed this game from start to finish, and the freeroam has been entertaining aswell.In the end, I would highly Reccommend GTA Liberty City Episodes, TBOGT Is a beautiful GTA 4 DLC that is a must have for any GTA Fan.

Doesn't add much aside from a good story and some new bikes.The Ballad of Gay Tony is essentially GTA 4.5 as it adds quite a lot of new content like APC's and military weaponry as well as a new story that ties off all the loose ends of the GTA 4 story quite well.

You get tanks, attack helicopters (missiles AND machine guns), new cars, new guns, and booty calls. Thats not even half of what this game has to offer you. So go out and buy it.

												It has two DLC episodes in it, the best one being Ballad of Gay Tony.Ballad of Gay Tony is one of my favourite GTA games ever made and is much better in many ways than GTA 4 itself.The story is very well made and you can really find yourself feeling for the main characters of the story.Some of the main missions are truly hilarious, this is also what sets Ballad of Gay Tony aside from GTA 4.Each episode is about 14 hours long up to 20 if you do all the side quests. (if you rush through the game it's minimum of about 8 hours)			"

												PSA: GFWL is rumored to be going off-line in July of 2014. If this is the case and it's developers do not migrate the game to steamworks, major features may cease to function. Some games, like the Arkham series, have already been migrated. There are still many left, including this one. If a port happens then this review will be removed.You can keep track of GFWL to steamworks ports at this wiki: http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/The_Big_List_of_3rd_Party_DRM_on_Steam#Games_for_Windows_Live "

												Some great DLC, for the wonderful GTA series. I really loved the story line to this and the new weapons/cars were also a great addition to the game. In this game you'll find that there is tons of things to explore ( again ) tons of enemys to kill ( again ) and tons of things to blow up, run over, shoot up, curse out, and steal!

												After a fair bit of playing this game, I thought I'd write an honest review about it (almost unheard of with me).A lot of people are saying how GFWL has broken this game and how it is the main reason to not buy this game. Honestly, GFWL doesnt affect my gameplay nor should it affect yours. I have gotten GFWL to work from the first day, but I never use it because literally no one plays multiplayer on this game anymore. So, therefore, GFWL is not needed.Also, people are saying that the PC version of this is broken. No, its not. So far, I have seen no extra bugs from what the other platforms already have with the exception of two problems - the fact that if you have a graphics card with 2GB or more for video memory GTA IV is not going to pick it up, and that The Lost and Dammed lags extensively. For the garphics problem, all you have to do is create a 'commandline.txt' file in the game directory increasing the 'availablevidmem' size. A lot of people dont know this and therefore, label the game as ""broken"". My computer has a nVidia GeForce 830m with 2GB of graphics, and it runs like a dream on the highest settings. For the extensive lag in TLaD, its unplayable. Even with the graphics turned down to the lowest possible settings, it lags from anywhere between 5 and 12 frames (for me personally). Also, the reaction times are severly affected due to the fact that the game will delay the action you want it to for at least 3 seconds. For example, if you go to shoot someone, it will not register the mouse click until 2-3 seconds later. Same for the keyboard input and mouse movement.The number one reason I bought this game was to mod it with the LCPDFR mod. But since then, I have installed multiple mods and it makes the gameplay twice as fun as with no mods. I have also clocked The Ballad of Gay Tony two times as I really enjoy the storyline. For me personally, its a game that will never get old.The computer I have used to help with this review:HP Pavilion 15-P008TU laptopIntel Core i5 @ 2.6Ghz processornVidia GeForce 830m graphics card8GB DDR3 memoryWin8.1 64bitNot a lot is required to run this game, as I could run it on medium graphics on a machine that was three times as weaker as this one above, using Win7 64bit.I legitimetely think this is a great game and I would seriously recommend it to anyone who is looking for an awesome game with a great storyline and freeplay as well as good modding capabilty. Just use TLaD at your own risk.			"

The biker one is good and but in the time I have played so far, the Ballad of Gay Tony is a better story. I have not beaten either story yet because of not enough time. I would recommend this game if you like GTA! It is a better port than GTA IV.Use this command to ""-norestrictions"" for the game to run like it should on Windows 8			"

												This is a great DLC for the already great GTA IV. You play as a night club co - owner caled Luis, who if you have played the main game or the first DLC, The Lost And Damned, you will have already seen before in cut scene situations. The gameplay is fluid, and exciting. This DLC adds a complete new story line under this new character, meaning a whole new barrel full of hilarious situations and side missions. There have been more activities added such as golf, and a whole host of night club based activities. Many new weapons are added, including remote detonated sticky bombs, which all help to make the game just as fun and destructive as a GTA game should be.Overall I think this DLC couldn't have been any better, and because of that I give it 10/10.

I logged into the same account I used for my Xbox 360 and it worked just fine.2. You can NOT play online. Which is obvious considering that GFWL is down. As for the quality of the game, it is fantastic. The DLC is fun and lengthy, (currently only ten hours in and I've only beaten lost and the damned and haven't really scratched the surface of the side missions.) "

												Better port than GTA IV. (However, when it comes to enb modding I prefer IV over EFLC because Rockstar did some lighting update which makes everything 100x brighter.) The story mission were really fun, such as skydiving, highjacking a train, varies of motorcycles ETC. Rock* satire humor never gets old, especially if you listen to their radio commercials. There's a lot of replay value and so much to do afterwards if you have the time to mod.			"

												First of all, don't listen to all the noobs who can't install Games For Windows Live and say it's broken and not working. It's false. GFWL installs with no problems whatsoever and you can login simply by registering on the games for windows website and installing the latest version of the software. Online also works, but very few players play this at the moment. Also, if for some reason you're not able to log in to the GFWL service you can still make an offline (LOCAL) profile and save your game, no problem at all. It's always been like that with GFWL, there was really no need to be online if you wanted to play single player. That being said, the game is just fine. I suppose people are just too dumb or spoiled so they trash this game because they don't know how to register on a site, update software or find the local profile option. I like GTA, although GTA IV and Episodes from Liberty City are my least favourite. I don't like the handling and the city feels kinda dead in comparisson to GTA San Andreas (which, speaking of, also is getting trashed by people for no reason at all. It did lose some songs, but that's about it. Been playing it for a long time since the update, no graphics glitches, no crashes, no anything.)I bought the game on sale and recommend for you to buy it too if you're a fan of sandbox games. Don't listen to the negative reviews regarding GFWL, it works just fine, you just have to use your brain a tiny little bit :)Buy GTA IVDownload the gameStart the gameRegister and login with Rockstar Social ClubRegister and login with Games For Windows LiveUpdate GFWL to the latest version from their website if neededPlay the game.orBuy GTA IVDownload the gameStart the gameRegister and login with Rockstar Social ClubStart a new local profile on Games for Windows LivePlay the game.Simple as that.

												So, I've just started EFLC, however, since there are so many reviews talking about how this game is broken and does not work, I wanted to give my initial assessment.The game works fine. It starts just fine, and both, Rockstar Social Club as well as Windows Live are working for me. I have had accounts for both networks for a number of years and they still work. The game runs smooth, better even than GTA IV does, although not by much. I had no problems changing the resolution, changing any of the settings in fact, and it even automatically imported most of my control mappings from GTA IV.I will write more about the entire game and its storyline once I had a chance to play more, but I wanted to write this much, to counteract all the negative reviews of people claiming the game is broken. I have not experienced any of these issues.			"

												The Ballad of Gay Tony is quite amazing. TBoGT has lots of new weapons and cars, the story is more enjoyable and the characters are more memorable. Lost and Damned was more monotonous aside from a couple of fun weapons and new bikes. A definite buy for some extended fun to the GTA IV world.			"

												Forget about Niko and get TBoGT (TLaD is just a bonus).The entire game owns the original IV...new weapons (truly awesome..such as C4 or M249), new cars (even unique ones), the L's story (much better than Niko's even it's shorter), the nightlife...and of course a CHUTE!So what should I say...definitely worth buying.P.S.

 Is it worth your money? ♥♥♥♥ Yeah! If you loved Gta IV than you'll love this even more! Im going to split this review into two sections one reviewing TLAD and TBOGT. Lost and the Damned Before I begin note that I played this first before I played TBOGT and my feeling for The lost and the Damned change once I played it but I'll try not to show any bias here. The story isnt as great as IV in TLAD so I wont really be mentioning it in the review. One big reason I love TLAD is because of how it brings you straight into the action unlike Gta IV which made me more hesitant towards marathoning this game through (the begining atleast). Another element of the game that made more happy to drive to the far away mission markers was that because I knew that I would be doing something badass in every mission like ambushing a convoy or stopping a prison bus the missions are really varied compared to Gta IV's drive here and kill this guy and that element is still here is just executed in a better manner. The new weapons are also a plus like the new Auto-Shotgun(auto shottie is bae) and automatic 9.mm which make firefights more intense. The Ballad of Gay Tony I went into TBOGT with me thinking that it would be like TLAD which is still good but the moment I realized that after 5 hours of starting the game I was  blowing up helicopters on top of the Empire State Building with an explosive shotgun and than I realized which game was superior. Not only that but the story isnt half bad because of all the crazy and hilarious characters you run across not to mention the even more crazier things they ask you to do. Their is a staggering amount of new stuff to do and use in the game participating in a triathilon,doing a drug deal with some friends or going on a civilian rampage with the games new tank (not really a tank) called the ACP. Score In the end I would reccomend this game to any gta fan or even any person who likes free roam games. The Lost and the Damned  8.4/10 The Ballad of Gay Tony  9.7/10			"

												As expansion packs go, this is easily amongst the best.Presenting GTA IV's Liberty City in two entirely different lights, these two games offer several hours each of extra missions and new characters, all set in the same world as the main game.The Lost and Damned follows a pack of bikers as they wage war on a rival gang, whilst struggling with their own internal politics.  The presentation of the world here is one far grittier even than Nico Belic's. The characters are well-realised throughout.  The focus on motorbikes (specifically choppers) is a nice move away from a focus on cars.The Ballad of Gay Tony demonstrates the lighter, brighter side of Liberty City, far more in line with Vice City's glitzy parody of Miami.If you are a fan of GTA IV (or indeed any other GTA game) you should really have played this already!

												在GTA5发售之际，通了TBOGT的主线剧情，总的来说没有TLAD和正传的剧情来得震撼人心，但是也足够合格了（我喜欢大团圆的结局）。剧情对于自由城上流社会生活做了非常丰富的描写，人物性格也非常鲜明，疯狂的中东地产大亨Yusuf让我想起了正传里的Bruce，不过他更加丧心病狂（Bruce反而在TBOGT里显得很规矩，大概是兄长Mori在的缘故），但是为人重情义，帮了主角Luis不少忙。本作的任务也堪称GTA4之最，游戏性几近GTASA（跳伞真的很好玩）。总而言之，该资料片对于GTA4原作是个非常好的补充。			"

You get tanks, attack helicopters (missiles AND machine guns), new cars, new guns, and booty calls. Thats not even half of what this game has to offer you. So go out and buy it.

												Alot of more stuff to do but the missions involved alot of helicopter use so it is a bit harder to finish. I wouldnt get this dlc unless you have played the actual GTA 4 because there are parts in the game where you see Niko. There are less people on servers using this dlc so i would put mods into this game if you only want one modded version of this game. Alot of new weapons and cars to mess around with including the famous APC. If you want to choose this game over another game i would buy the other game if you want the other game more than this dlc.			"

												Another great GTA title. Episodes from Liberty City has two episodes, one about a motorcycle gang (which is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to me) and another about a gay Tony who owns night clubs. Was entertaining and I liked the Tony episode more. It's missing some key elemets I loved in original games like buying property and clothing. Other than that it's pretty solid piece of work.Oh and like GTA IV this often lags horribly even with high end equipment, badly coded game.			"

												I've seen lots of reviews stating about the game being broken. I do agree in certain points like when the game asks for GFWL login to play your online save games, which means when you play in online or offline mode, they are seperate save games, which really sucks. Multiplayer isn't a good point either.There's just not enough players to play with.But in terms of playability, this game is definitely great. I played with high video quality in 1080p rez and still no lag or frame drops on a mid-end gaming laptop.The Ballad of Gay Tony has an awesome storyline but The Lost and Damned didn't really impressed me. Overall I would still recommend this game.			"

 Gay Tony?	You'll Always Be the King of this Town. You own this town. We gettin Arab Money.Although this is my favourite Grand Theft Auto IV DLC.If you're up to some Dominican protagonist storyline which will tell you about nightlife, clubs, russians and big heistsall of that within Gay Tony's ballad, you will like this game for a weekend.This is kinda straight to the point game - in other words: major action is at the spotlight.Happy pills:(+) Funny protagonists.(+) Powerful weapons.(+) Good multiplayer experience.(+) Optimal graphics performance.(+) Missions are not just cool: awesome.(+) Entertaining multiplayer.Guilty pills:(-) Excessive missions (one man army required).(-) Overloaded map, lack of street races.Highly recommended.Played on my Alienware 17 notebook @1600x900 resolution, with very high settings at avg. 35 fps.

However, some mission's gut stuck duo the i7 cpu, turning them all off except one for these missions (alt-tab too windows) (processor afinity) will solve that problem. Once the mission is loaded you can turn them all back on (otherwise the game will lag during your mission). Enjoy the game.Grtz			"

												Doesn't work with windows 8.1, just opens social club then closes after authenticating.  (also doesn't work in compatability mode.)Dear Steam devs, or Rockstar, if you aren't going to continue supporting the games you sell. Refund the people effected!Unplayable in singleplayer and multiplayer.Edit: After finding a version of GFWL online, I was able to boot single player, but still unable to access multiplayer. (PS: If the steam version of GTA4 came with GFWL to make the game work, I'd change my recommendation.)			"

												Good addition that compliments well with Grand Theft Auto IV. Another big hit from Rockstar definitely! This game will keep you glued to your PC for weeks, with new storyline that relates to Niko Bellic and the diamond saga that causes so much conflict in the first place.  The downside there's not much replayability after completing the storyline, same repetition of drug wars missions and the base jumping side missions will cause so much grief if you intend to achieve a 100% game completion.

												A great couple of DLCs, thankfully nothing game breaking this time, though the chopper missions can definitely make you rage alot (granted an XBox controller might be worlds better than playing with the keyboard like I did). Rockstar took some of the best aspects of GTA 4, brought them forward into this, and added even better stuff in on top of it. Aside from some rage worthy moments here and there, it is all in all an awesome time.			"

I have the mouse problem and tryed everything. diffrent mouses, changing my CPU settings, changing the version of windows that the game runs in.  So I say ♥♥♥♥ steam and ♥♥♥♥ the franchise for putting a game out and NOT putting a worring before buying. I expect a refund for the bundle pack. So this reveaw will go on every site I can get it on. and I will give it the worst rating I can intell problem is fixed or refund is given.

												First of all, don't listen to all the noobs who can't install Games For Windows Live and say it's broken and not working. It's false. GFWL installs with no problems whatsoever and you can login simply by registering on the games for windows website and installing the latest version of the software. Online also works, but very few players play this at the moment. Also, if for some reason you're not able to log in to the GFWL service you can still make an offline (LOCAL) profile and save your game, no problem at all. It's always been like that with GFWL, there was really no need to be online if you wanted to play single player. That being said, the game is just fine. I suppose people are just too dumb or spoiled so they trash this game because they don't know how to register on a site, update software or find the local profile option. I like GTA, although GTA IV and Episodes from Liberty City are my least favourite. I don't like the handling and the city feels kinda dead in comparisson to GTA San Andreas (which, speaking of, also is getting trashed by people for no reason at all. It did lose some songs, but that's about it. Been playing it for a long time since the update, no graphics glitches, no crashes, no anything.)I bought the game on sale and recommend for you to buy it too if you're a fan of sandbox games. Don't listen to the negative reviews regarding GFWL, it works just fine, you just have to use your brain a tiny little bit :)Buy GTA IVDownload the gameStart the gameRegister and login with Rockstar Social ClubRegister and login with Games For Windows LiveUpdate GFWL to the latest version from their website if neededPlay the game.orBuy GTA IVDownload the gameStart the gameRegister and login with Rockstar Social ClubStart a new local profile on Games for Windows LivePlay the game.Simple as that.

												This is a great DLC for the already great GTA IV. You play as a night club co - owner caled Luis, who if you have played the main game or the first DLC, The Lost And Damned, you will have already seen before in cut scene situations. The gameplay is fluid, and exciting. This DLC adds a complete new story line under this new character, meaning a whole new barrel full of hilarious situations and side missions. There have been more activities added such as golf, and a whole host of night club based activities. Many new weapons are added, including remote detonated sticky bombs, which all help to make the game just as fun and destructive as a GTA game should be.Overall I think this DLC couldn't have been any better, and because of that I give it 10/10.

If you get the infinite loading glitch, it is to do with the -availablevidmem thing so just up the number on it. if you do this it should work and the same goes for GTA 4.

												I love GTA IV, don't get me wrong. I love EfLC even more especially for LatD because I live right next to Sturgis and thus the Sturgis Biker Rally. But the Steam version is crap. First time around I was able to create an offline profile on GFWL so I could save. Now it won't even open Live anymore, so I have to restart every time. Again love this game to death, so many memories, but this is completely useless. Until it gets fixed, it's not worth the $20 for some nostalgia. I'd even rather pay $20 to get kicked in the balls, because at least I would get what I paid for.Steel-toe sack tap >>> GTA IV			"

Once the mission is loaded you can turn them all back on (otherwise the game will lag during your mission). Enjoy the game.Grtz			"

												These two fairly-short campaigns add back some of the more ""video-gamey"" elements that were missing in the main game.   And the friend system is much, much better. No more phone calls, dates with your friends are completely optional, and you still get the bonuses they provide (mobile gun shop, mission backup, free cars, etc.). Unfortunately you're married to your chopper in The Lost and the Damned, but The Ballad of Gay Tony is much more open-minded when it comes to what vehicle you choose to drive.Still has the same optimization issues as GTA IV, but still playable if you launch the game outside of Steam (directly from LaunchEFLC.exe).

												Probably a decent expansion to a good game, but the dialogue was so absurd, so surreal and kafkaesque that I could not enjoy it. It's like they hired actual aliens with no understanding of human interaction and asked them to do their best approximation of what a conversation might be like. It didn't feel human and it didn't feel real or believable.Nobody talks like that, no one.Still if you want more GTA then yes, it's absolutely recommended. Just leave your head at the door though.

												I have played and reviewed Grand Theft Auto IV and I can tell you EFLC runs slightly better. These two DLCs include everything from GTAIV and introduce several new weapons, vehicles, mechanics, etc...The Lost and Damned follows the story of Johnny Klebitz, who you may remember as he works with Niko in some missions, and the Lost MC. New weapons like the Sawed-Off Shotgun, Automatic 9mm, Pipe Bombs (and more) are fun to use, along with the unique cars/bikes which have been added.The Ballad of Gay Tony introduces a less miserable and depressing Liberty City and features weapons like the .44 Pistol, Automatic Shotgun, Advanced Sniper, Sticky Bombs (and more). You play as Luis Lopez, who was a hostage in the bank heist Niko and the McRearies pulled off. It has a very large variety of missions, too. It also features new cars, bikes, boats and helicopters (such as the popular 'Buzzard').In short, EFLC is a great addition to the franchise and is certainly worth playing if you enjoyed GTAIV.			"

												As I mentioned in my review for the main game: This is an atrocious mess. Not just on Windows 10, either. This is designed to be a headache right out of the box on any version of Windows.I'll leave a brief summary of what I had to do to get this working: First off right-click the game title in the Steam library (not in Windoes Explorer like I initially did), click properties, and in 'launch options' put this line: -nomemrestrict -norestrictions ...that will make the game accept modern resolutions without crashing your computer. Then you'll want to take care of the GFWL crisis BEFORE YOU EVEN START THE GAME OTHERWISE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SAVE! (and they don't even warn you that you need to be logged into GFWL ahead of time, not even a whisper). Go to this site http://gtaforums.com/topic/388658-relgtaiv-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥/ and download the first link. Unrar that item and copy all those files to the game files of both GTA IV and the expansions. That should delete GFWL from being mandatory for saving.Rockstar Social Club also has a failing login but it seems you can play the game without it, so just opt to 'play offline' and you're good to go. Unless you want to play multiplayer, then I have no freaking clue what you'll need to do. :\			"

												The lost and the damned is a fairly interesting piece of DLC, but the ballad of Gay Tony is where it really shines.  BoGT reintroduces some minigames and the overall sense of humor that was missing from GTAIV and LatD, complete with a cast of characters that you never really want to meet.			"

												GTA IV Marked the beginning, and Episodes From Liberty City Opens the Next Two Chapters of this new Era of GTA.The Lost and The Dammned brings us into the shoes of Patriotic Young Middle Age Biker Johnny Klebitz, from the start you feel like part of the gang, you ride your Metallic Stallion down the highway with your brothers in tow, banter and insults fly as you cruise around the city, you couldn't feel more at home behind the handbars until now.The Ballad of Gay Tony shows us the highlife of Liberty Cities Posh,  Rich and the Stupid, as we roll into the sneakers of Luis Lopez, and we see the return of more of the sillyness GTA IV denied us in IV, Solid Gold Helicopters you say? SWAT Tanks? they're all here, along with the Fast Cars, Fast Women, and Good Guns.Episodes from Liberty City fits snuggly into the already established Story of IV involving Coccaine Diamonds and Rivalry, you haven't had the full experiance till you've played these GemsEpisodes of Liberty City gets 8/10			"

												GTA: Episodes from Liberty City is a nice DLC for GTA IV. This time you’re getting a chance to see the life of characters that crossed swords with Niko Bellic in GTA IV.You have Johnny who’s a veteran member of The Lost, a notorious biker gang. (The Lost and Damned).Then you have Luis Lopez a part-time hoodlum and full-time assistant to a nightclub owner Tony Prince also known as Gay Tony. (The Ballad of Gay Tony).Whether you play Johnny or Luis, you will still commit grand scale crimes in Liberty City and you’ll get to see how and why they crossed swords with Niko Bellic, so this DLC really gives a in depth view of the crime activities in Liberty City from all angles.I keep saying DLC, it’s not really. Because you don’t need to buy GTA IV in order to play this. It is in fact a standalone game. I recommend this game (and GTA IV, it's also a keeper!).Peace. "

												Alot of more stuff to do but the missions involved alot of helicopter use so it is a bit harder to finish. I wouldnt get this dlc unless you have played the actual GTA 4 because there are parts in the game where you see Niko. There are less people on servers using this dlc so i would put mods into this game if you only want one modded version of this game. Alot of new weapons and cars to mess around with including the famous APC. If you want to choose this game over another game i would buy the other game if you want the other game more than this dlc.			"

												Намного интереснее оригинальной GTA 4. Покупайте не задумываясь, две игры по цене одной это просто халява. Эти две новые истории сюжетно переплетаются с четвертой часть, но игра за каждого персонажа совсем разная. За Луиса Лопеса, помошника владельца клуба, придется окунуться в мир гламура и разврата, попутно избавляясь от конкурентов клуба и делать просто сумашедшие вещи, такие как угон вертолетов, растрел огромного катера, прыжки с парашютом, подрыв поездов и частных самолетоов для богатых. Игра за байкера тоже очень интересна, игра предстает перед нами в мрачном стиле. Много придется ездить на мотоциклах, участвовать в соревнованиях по арм реслингу и т.д. В игру добавили много нового оружия, более трехста новых песен и две новые радиостанции, а также много новых машин, вертолетов и мотоциклов. Вобщем игра бомба, по сравнению с оригинальной частью, это просто шедевр. Плюс, скучать вас не заставят новые режимы сетевой игры и разнообразные задания с драг диллерством. Моя оценка 10/10. P.S - Такие большие дополнения которые превращаются в полноценную игру - редкость.			"

												My clean up of GFWL games continues so I never have to see that piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥again. This one follows what's become the typical GTA hierarchy; the music is the best part, followed by the story, then the driving, then the combat. Unfortunately, the story wasn't that great in this one. It started out pretty good but really unraveled at the end, seemingly just to rush the story to a conclusion. I enjoyed being on a chopper basically the entire time, and Liberty Rock Radio was damn good as expected, but other sandbox series have really left the gameplay of GTA in the dust. Hopefully Rockstar North realizes that and really tightens it up for V.			"

												I probably would not have purchased this game if I would have realized the main characters would be Bikers and Puerto Ricans, I find thier dialogue to be highly annoying. The characters just are not as endeering or likeable as GTA4, in my opinion. Otherwise, the gameplay is enjoyable and the addition of new weapons and vehicles is awesome. I do feel they have changed the way road vehicles drive, they seem to slip more than in the original game. so, I will give a - for characters and a + for enhancements to the game.			"

												Grand Theft Auto IV, a game that blew everyone's minds just because of the graphics. And then you realized San Andreas had way more to offer with less graphics. So what would be a solution to making a game seem so great with limited variety? Add some Downloadable Content that probably should of been in the game since Day One but at the same time make you feel like it is optional. Well I guess that's not entirely how Episodes of Liberty City was formed, just most DLC in general. Although this DLC I'll give some credit, you don't have to buy the original game to play it, which is pretty neat. Though makes you kind of wish all the content in Episodes of Liberty City would be indluded in the orignal game. I'll explain later on that but for now let's talk about the Episodes starting with the first one mostly everyone picked first, The Lost and the Damned. Okay maybe I picked it first.So the Lost and the Damned, what's it about. It's about a Biker named Johnny, who's no way related to a Greaser named Johnny back in another Rockstar game called ""Bully,"" who all he wants is to ride with his Biker Gang and assist. The name of the Biker Gang is called ""The Lost,"" who's runned by Billy who was in rehab for drugs. Supposably Johnny and Billy were great friends but since Billy's return it appears to not be as strong anymore. You even get a sense of betrayal is coming up. Well Spoiler Alert that's kind of what happens. The Lost and the Damned is basically Bully just shorten with blood and guns. Oh yes, the episode itself is not as long as the original game which is kind of dissapointing especially since these episodes are playable stand-alone. What's more the story of each episode takes place during the original game's timeline. So you would think there would be more going than just helping a mere Biker Gang with the Leader getting arrested all in attempt to get rid of Johnny. Though it may be short in story, it does add new weapons and do they play the part in a Biker Gang. From Automatic pistols to the classic sawed-off Shotgun. As you progress you'll gain other new weapons not seen in Grand Theft Auto IV, but since the story's short, it won't take long at all. Oh and Johnny has a problem playing dress-up. Yeah if you were thinking of making Johnny wear something other than a leather jacket for the whole game, I'm afraid that's not possible. Although I wouldn't mind the same kind of Jacket being worn by Niko Bellic, oh well next Episode.The other is known as ""The Ballad of Gay Tony,"" and I won't lie, I thought you was going to play as Tony, but this Episode has the ""Legend of Zelda Syndrom"" meaning you play as another guy. And this guy is pretty much a Dominican Quagmire who goes by the name ""Luis."" Tony is the man you work for due to personal reasons that involve Luis' history with Tony. No nothing like that, more like Tony helpped Luis when Luis needed help though most. So Luis feels honorbound to help and work for Tony no matter what. Unlike The Lost episode, Ballad feels more lively. And it may not be as short as The Lost (though still far shorter than GTA IV) but there was much going on. Also like The Lost, this takes place during Grand Theft Auto IV's timeline, more specifically right after the Bank Robbery. You soon meet Tony and you're off to some meet, which ends up in a big fire fight trying to get out the door. Though this also introduces you to one of the new weapons in this Episode, but soon later in the game you realize both episodes have their own exclusive guns and weapons. As much I like The Lost in style, Ballad has my vote for most content. I mean there's a bunch of guns in it that really should have been in the original game from the start. But doesn't matter which one you like, it's an automatic hands down that the Shotgun in this game is Over Powered. Why? Explosive Rounds. The Ballad of Gay Tony is the only episode part of the GTA IV timeline that features Explosive Round ammunition. And boy could it do damage to EVERYTHING! Also early in the game you get to high jack a new Helicopter, a buzzard which unlike the orignal or the Lost features Rockets and Miniguns. The moment you started piloting it, you just didn't want off. Also Parachutes are in it. Guess what, they wasn't in Grand Theft Auto IV, big suprise. And where as Johnny didn't like playing dress-up Luis has no problems with it. Though doesn't like buying clothes so might as well wear what you have. I mentioned before how both of the episodes are part of the same timeline, What you might be wondering is what is Ballad's part of the story other than being bossed around by a gay guy. Well really this is the Episode that explains a bit on the whole Diamond thing that partially was around in Grand Theft Auto IV and as well in The Lost episode. But this shows how it started and how it ended which you know, I'm glad. I'm glad because those Diamonds seemed useless to the story in Grand Theft Auto IV to begin with, and the fact you didn't get them in the end was like ""What was the point?"" This Episode gives the point but I still think the Diamonds shouldn't of been a thing, but it works only for this Episode.Is Episodes of Liberty City worth getting? Not alone, I would get this along with Grand Theft Auto IV just to understand most of the story. Also with both episodes quite short in story, you may end up feel like ""what else to do?"" There is a Multiplayer option which has the same options in the orignal Grand Theft Auto IV, however customizing your character is more limited in customization. This is not a Bad DLC / game, just I wouldn't recommend buying it without getting the original. It's fun to play as a rage fueled biker along with a sex crazed bar manager. And the content given is very nice. But the Story length for both is not really enough to get this alone. Now if you are planning to get Grand Theft Auto IV, then yeah get this just to experience a little bit more.			"

 Gay Tony?	You'll Always Be the King of this Town. You own this town.

												Endless hours of entertainment with this game weather you choose to do missions, or just cause havoc on the streets of Liberty City. Of course the more missions you complete, the more you're going to have options as far as weapons and newer exotic vehicles to steal. Software itself is well rendered and the modelling within the game is superb without causing my system to grind to a ultra slow march. Spectacular graphics with settings maxed out			"

												Was never much a fan of GTA games and still not even after GTAV... However... The Ballad of Gay Tony is an asset to the franchise! Enjoyed that DLC more than any whole GTA game. Not only did it flesh out the GTA4 story, but the characters were actually entertaining! The other 1/2 though of this package though, Lost and Damned, I didn't give one flying **** for that.			"

Is a very fun game, which explore new metagame and increase the fun of normal GTA 4 game.I like:- New GTA expereriences, and comeback of old GTA experiences, all in 1 expansion.- New cars and weapons, music and missions.- Parachute comeback! hahha- New sarcasm in stories about life and friends in the societyI dislike:- You only can run Lost and Damned or Gay Tony for separatelly, not together.- Sometimes the game crash, but are very rare and random crashes.

Doesn't add much aside from a good story and some new bikes.The Ballad of Gay Tony is essentially GTA 4.5 as it adds quite a lot of new content like APC's and military weaponry as well as a new story that ties off all the loose ends of the GTA 4 story quite well.

												These two fairly-short campaigns add back some of the more ""video-gamey"" elements that were missing in the main game.   And the friend system is much, much better. No more phone calls, dates with your friends are completely optional, and you still get the bonuses they provide (mobile gun shop, mission backup, free cars, etc.). Unfortunately you're married to your chopper in The Lost and the Damned, but The Ballad of Gay Tony is much more open-minded when it comes to what vehicle you choose to drive.Still has the same optimization issues as GTA IV, but still playable if you launch the game outside of Steam (directly from LaunchEFLC.exe).

												I played this on my ps3 for 1000+ hours and I have this game on a cd and when I saw the gta collection sale I bought the 4th copy of this game. I love everything about gta 4 and the modding is fun to check out. Anyway I love tbogt and tlad. Very fun to play through once in a while and, for me, it doesn't get repetitive. It runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥though! But there are enough fixes for that so don't worry about it.			"

												overall good game mabey is has been ported a little bad but hey look rockstar aint perfect :) also with windows 7 it works better and if you have intel you might have some problems such as broken models/textures but i mean your going to need a dedicated gpu anywase to run it the way they attended :) overall 10/10 the devs really stepped up their game the year of release and im proud of that if your looking for a game where you can run people over with them on your wind shield or let them hold onto your car door while you drive OR if you just love ragdolls and good physics you have found the right game :D so if you see anything i listed in this comment that you would like in a game i Suggest you buy this game :)			"

												Rockstar outdid themselves quite this time.A dlc which feels like 2 games!Woah!The lost and damned(tlad) and The ballad of gay tony(tbogt).The lost and damned-Pros-+Continues the winning saga of gta iv.+Liberty city viewed from the bikers.+Gritty and violent. +Voice acting and writing.+Relationship between Johnny and Ashley.+Bikes are easier to maneuver and a lot of fun driving around the city in it.Cons--Most of the missions are like gta iv.Brings nothing new to the table other few guns and side missions.-Rather short.Score-8.5/10The Ballad of Gay TonyPros-+More lighthearted.A break from gta iv's bleak outlook on life.+Liberty city viewed from the rich class.+Crazy missions reminding of gta sanandreas. +Parachuting.+Gold helicopters :P+Yusuf Amir!+Overall solid campaign.Cons--Too many aerial missions.Score-9.5/10Overall-9/10Must play for people who liked iv.

												Well, even with thermal throttling on my CPU this game performed really well, with a Fx-8350 and a GTX 760 runs perfectly 60fps steady as long as I know 'cause I've the V-Sync on, anyways, after talking about the PC Port stuff I'd like to review the actual game:This game has a nostalgia factor on me so I actually don't mind to see worse graphics than GTA 5, I originally played this expansions when they were Xbox 360 exclusive, those were good times, anyways, this is being sold as a new game here on steam, (Something that I totally understand) but as I consider them DLC's they have a BIGGER value for me, I mean, new weapons, really good storylines, TBOGT has some of the funniest misions on the GTA series at all, Liberty City is a place full of life, of course now it doesn't seem that good if we compare it to GTA 5 but, this game is different, is the latest great Grand Theft Auto game, I don't mean that GTA 5 is a bad game, of course I don't, I'm just saying that GTA 5 doesn't feel the classic way, it's almost perfect technically, not like a game that was trying to innovate, GTA 5 perfects everything which is good but GTA 4 and EFLC were trying to make people get excited, this is not objetive at all, but, if you like the old GTA style this is the best version you'll have, playing this game is like taking a whiff from the old times.

												As I mentioned in my review for the main game: This is an atrocious mess. Not just on Windows 10, either. This is designed to be a headache right out of the box on any version of Windows.I'll leave a brief summary of what I had to do to get this working: First off right-click the game title in the Steam library (not in Windoes Explorer like I initially did), click properties, and in 'launch options' put this line: -nomemrestrict -norestrictions ...that will make the game accept modern resolutions without crashing your computer. Then you'll want to take care of the GFWL crisis BEFORE YOU EVEN START THE GAME OTHERWISE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SAVE! (and they don't even warn you that you need to be logged into GFWL ahead of time, not even a whisper). Go to this site http://gtaforums.com/topic/388658-relgtaiv-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥/ and download the first link. Unrar that item and copy all those files to the game files of both GTA IV and the expansions. That should delete GFWL from being mandatory for saving.Rockstar Social Club also has a failing login but it seems you can play the game without it, so just opt to 'play offline' and you're good to go. Unless you want to play multiplayer, then I have no freaking clue what you'll need to do. :\			"

												I bought this game the other day and I was going to refund it as soon as it downloaded because of the reviews on this game but I thought I would go ahead and give it a try and it works great on my pc I don't have any of the problems people have been complaining about. I love this game so much especially TLAD and I will be spending hours on this game since I have some time to waste :D			"

												Note: You MUST install ""X Live Less"" (without the spaces, Steam blocks the word for some reason. Google it, first link) to play this game. GFWL has discontinued and it is impossible to get past the authentication check without  ""X Live Less"".Did you like GTA4 and wanted more? And not quite ready for GTA5 yet or just loved Liberty City? Well this is for you. Definitely play the base GTA4 first as the events in this game are concurrent to GTA4, with the characters making cameos and references to the main story. Really this is two seperate stories in one, The Lost and the Damned, and The Ballad of Gay Tony. The Lost and the Damned has you leading a motorcycle gang through gang wars, fighting off the government from trying to shut you down and dealing with lots of drugs. You better get used to driving a motorcycle, you'll be on it a lot. At least they made you ""stickier"" now, used to fly off when hitting a pebble in GTA4. It's really a fairly tragic story, I won't ruin it but it shows that gang life is tough, brutal, and destroys everyone's life. It is a fun story with plenty of action, and a shoot and destroy everything final mission.The Ballad of Gay Tony is, well, much more fun than TLOU. You're Luis Lopez, helping your business partner Gay Tony (the game makes it quite clear that Luis is very straight, women falling over themselves to have him and he doesn't say no) keep your club afloat while short muscleheads, Russians and other gangs come to collect the debts you owe for the money you borrowed to run the Club. Plus you meet a very crass, very loud, very obnoxious, very, very rich arab man who loves guns, sex, and things money can't buy, who sets you on missions to steal outrageous things in some of the most fun missions in GTA. Seriously Yusuf missions are a treat. The only real negative of TBOGT which does hurt it some are all the helicopter missions, there's a disproportionate amount and the helicopter conrols and camera are just awful. Fortunately the missions aren't too hard, but I hate them nonetheless for the terrible controls. The story is compelling, and makes you race from one mission to the next. If you can only play this or TLOU, play this. All in all TLOU takes about 7 hours, TBOGT takes about 10 hours (assuming you only do the story missions), and are quite fun. The graphics more or less hold up today, though I still sometimes get 15 fps dips even with my Titan X and i7-6800k, odd. I do recommend the CryENB v3 for a bit better graphics. Enjoy the game, you won't regret it.8.9/10			"

												These two fairly-short campaigns add back some of the more ""video-gamey"" elements that were missing in the main game.   And the friend system is much, much better. No more phone calls, dates with your friends are completely optional, and you still get the bonuses they provide (mobile gun shop, mission backup, free cars, etc.). Unfortunately you're married to your chopper in The Lost and the Damned, but The Ballad of Gay Tony is much more open-minded when it comes to what vehicle you choose to drive.Still has the same optimization issues as GTA IV, but still playable if you launch the game outside of Steam (directly from LaunchEFLC.exe).

												A great expansion to the already amazing GTA IV.The Lost and Dammed was a good start, with a few new weapons and cars. The missions do complete the plot holes in the original GTA IV, so it is a must play if you want to get the full picture of Nicko's story. However, without spoiling much, it is a very drepessing story and overall environment. On the other hand, the Ballad of Gay Tony is, not surprisingly, more colorfull. It's all about going to parties, out in the night, score chicks, have fun, an environment that pleases me more. I also prefer the main character to the one in the Lost and Dammed.Again, these two episodes complete GTA IV.			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS! UNLESS YOU LIKE TO SPEND MONEY ON WORDS IN YOUR LIBRARY. I literally bought this game during the winter sale and still unable to run it. Once I found out about steam refunds, I jumped on it and tried to return this. Funny though how I was unable to return it because the numerous times I tried to click play and it crashed. added up to over 2hrs (gta IV). I literally played nothing of this NOR GTA IV, and yet my hours show as if I've played them. This to me is Fraud. I tried to explain the situation but It's just a huge headache and waste of time and money. I implore you to avoid ANY of the GTA IV franchise on PC. Including the Episodes. It will not work and you won't be able to return it because once you install it and run it just for it to crash, your hours will add up like a broken taxi meter.			"

I can run GTA V on full graphics at over 60fps happily... This combined with the aids that is GFWL makes the game a pain in the nicely sized butt to play. If you can get passed both of these issues, the game is awesome and really fun (same with GTA IV). I can only recommend this game on a decent sale but not at full price.			"

												The Lost and Damned wasn't all that fun to get through TBH. The main character is boring, the story is short and kinda sucks. But the new weapons are awesome.The Ballad of Gay Tony is on a whole another level though. TBoGT features great characters, lots of humour and amazing music. The new weapons are even better than those in TLaD. Missions are a lot of fun and over-the-top, reminiscent of San Andreas. And the dancing minigame is awesome too.			"

												“Man was born for society. However little He may be attached to the World, He never can wholly forget it, or bear to be wholly forgotten by it. Disgusted at the guilt or absurdity of Mankind, the Misanthrope flies from it: He resolves to become an Hermit, and buries himself in the Cavern of some gloomy Rock. While Hate inflames his bosom, possibly He may feel contented with his situation: But when his passions begin to cool; when Time has mellowed his sorrows, and healed those wounds which He bore with him to his solitude, think you that Content becomes his Companion? Ah! no, Rosario. No longer sustained by the violence of his passions, He feels all the monotony of his way of living, and his heart becomes the prey of Ennui and weariness. He looks round, and finds himself alone in the Universe: The love of society revives in his bosom, and He pants to return to that world which He has abandoned. Nature loses all her charms in his eyes: No one is near him to point out her beauties, or share in his admiration of her excellence and variety. Propped upon the fragment of some Rock, He gazes upon the tumbling waterfall with a vacant eye, He views without emotion the glory of the setting Sun. Slowly He returns to his Cell at Evening, for no one there is anxious for his arrival; He has no comfort in his solitary unsavoury meal: He throws himself upon his couch of Moss despondent and dissatisfied, and wakes only to pass a day as joyless, as monotonous as the former.” ― Matthew Gregory Lewis, The Monk			"

												I probably would not have purchased this game if I would have realized the main characters would be Bikers and Puerto Ricans, I find thier dialogue to be highly annoying. The characters just are not as endeering or likeable as GTA4, in my opinion. Otherwise, the gameplay is enjoyable and the addition of new weapons and vehicles is awesome. I do feel they have changed the way road vehicles drive, they seem to slip more than in the original game. so, I will give a - for characters and a + for enhancements to the game.			"

If you get the infinite loading glitch, it is to do with the -availablevidmem thing so just up the number on it. if you do this it should work and the same goes for GTA 4.

												I love GTA IV, don't get me wrong. I love EfLC even more especially for LatD because I live right next to Sturgis and thus the Sturgis Biker Rally. But the Steam version is crap. First time around I was able to create an offline profile on GFWL so I could save. Now it won't even open Live anymore, so I have to restart every time. Again love this game to death, so many memories, but this is completely useless. Until it gets fixed, it's not worth the $20 for some nostalgia. I'd even rather pay $20 to get kicked in the balls, because at least I would get what I paid for.Steel-toe sack tap >>> GTA IV			"

												for everybody that complains about the game not working without windows games live...you do understand that there is a mod that enables you to play the game AND save it AND play online without games for windows do you?that mod also makes the game run without social club...and that mod exists for almost 5 years or more now...overall this standalone DLC is amazing, i loved both stories, but yeah the original GTA IV story is much more in depth and interesting.i wouldn't recommend buying EFLC from steam, but from sites like♥♥♥♥♥or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ its a steal and really worth its price!8/10 for me (only because using that mod is nowadays a necessity to play the game)			"
