TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:An old game (by the time I wrote this review) but a great game nonetheless.As you might know, this is a Star Wars game based on the Clone Wars era where you are the leader of an elite Clone Commando Unit tasked with some of the most dangerous and most critical missions in service of the Galactic Republic.PROS:+ Story: -Amazing story that places you not in the eyes of a skillful Jedi or a powerful Sith, but in the boots of Clone Troopers fighting the war. The game delivers in terms of story with its superior voice acting by Temuera Morrison (Jango Fett) as well and the various personalities of your squad mates really adds to the experience.+ Squad Mechanics: -You cannot Rambo (go solo) this game, mainly because the squad is mandatory, BUT also because the game is brutal as hell (like most old FPS games). Enemies are really hard to kill without your squad's support requiring the players to properly order their squads into position and direct their fire when necessary.+ Graphically pleasing despite its age: -Released on 2005, this game carries a dated visual design, but pleasing nonetheless. Animation is good and the atmosphere is immersive. (I simply love the HUD in this game)+ Sound: -One of the greatest OST I have ever heard. (Vode An is the greatest of these OST)+ Gameplay: -Lengthy campaign without getting boring: There is always action around the corner.CONS:- Squad AI is a bit limited: -Although the AI, for the most part, is intelligent and is far more useful than some of the other AI partners in modern games, I feel as though a bit more could have been done. They follow command well enough.- Bugged Graphic setting in terms of Bump Mapping: -Remained unfix to this day. (can be turned off in the options menu though)Additional Note:The game is linear (corridor shooting), from start to finish. THIS IS NOT A BAD THING PEOPLE. Not all games need to be open world, specially if the game, such as this one, is trying to properly tell the story in a progressive fashion giving the player a sense of direction and purpose.CONCLUSION:MUST BUY and MUST OWN for any Star Wars fan or First Person Shooter fans.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												People often complain about the stone-faced, bald and monotomous space marines in videogames; how they're an extremely overused template and stifle the development of round characters. Republic Commando puts an interesting spin on this complaint: It gives you four clones; four space marines. That's where the complaining ends.Republic Commando is a squad based shooter set in the Star Wars universe during the Clone Wars. You play Delta 38 ""Boss"", leader of a highly specialised and extremely elite squad of Clones. You're bred with a great affinity for your clone bretheren. Your squad is as much a part of your arsenal as your special rifles and armour. Repulic Commando translates this premise to gameplay in an absolutely incredible way. You can 'direct' your squad to perform tasks while you hold off the enemy. Or you can work on the objective while you let them hold the line. The surprise in this comes from their intelligence. More often than not, CPU allies are less than helpful. Not the Clone Commandos; they are in a league of their own. They take, and move through cover, hide when the odds are against them, secure the area before helping you instead of running in headlong, and their aim is about as good as your own, so they don't feel considerably overpowered. What also helps is a careful balance of enemies. There are just enough in each room to keep it interesting, but never too many to make it feel like a grindfest. Your three squadmates (and yourself) are the bread and butter of the game's presentation. 2005 graphics haven't aged so dignified, but the artstyle gets the job done. Everything looks slightly grittier and messier than it does in the films. You'll quickly determine this when you use the melee button a droid for the first time and the grease and battery acid are wiped off your visor with a laser. The helmet display resembles that of Metroid Prime a lot, complete with ambient effects and splatter. But, enough about the visuals, the real fun is in the sound. You, and your brothers engage in a lot comic banter to keep spirits up. You, the boss are the tough as nails leader, voiced by Mr Jango Fett himself. Delta 62 ""Scorch"" is the squad's demolitions expert and all-round joker. Delta 40 ""Fixer"" is the straight man and computer specialist. And finally, Delta 07 ""Sev"", the sniper and gruesome sadist. The dialogue exchange is worth its weight in gold and because the game's pace is tight and condenced, they don't end up looping up. It gives the whole endeavor a lively character that is a nice offset to the gritty visuals. Still, there are some things you'll have to consider. The game isn't very long; you can tear through it an afternoon. Replaying it wastes some of the surprise moments, but you'll be better at some of the positioning and directions, allowing you to focus on speedrunning for instance. Some gauntlets can also feel extremely cheap at first. Sometimes you'll end up reloading a particular section over and over again because you squad gets wiped within the first 10 seconds. And then there is the ending off course. I'll let you figure that out on your own. I can reccommend this game to anyone who is a Star Wars fan, and to anyone looking for a shooter with exemplary squad AI and gameplay.			"

												Edit 25/11/2016I'm giving SW:RC the Test of time award because out of all of the old games from my childhood I've tried to get back into, I got back into this absolutely no problem. If graphics aren't a dealbreaker to you, try this game, it truly is one of the best Star Wars games ever made, perhaps only second to SW:KotOR.Reasons to get this game. 1. Squad banter2. Detonate explosives3. Awesome breach door manoeuvers4. Great story (short but great)5. Awesome music which fits surprisingly well with the Star Wars universe			"

												In this game, you play as Commando Delta 38 (Boss/Leader).The game follows the story of three missions throughout Delta Squad's career in the Separatist Crisis.From fighting alongside wookies to getting your face drilled by a scavenger droid, you lead your squad to complete objectives your normal, mass produced, counterparts could/cannot.The game and story is nice, I loved it and maybe you will too. This is from the soldier's perspective as to the usual jedi perspective. The game plays pretty damn smooth on PC. I haven't had any real game-breaking problems. The game is old enough to even play on lower-end laptops. You get to actually order your squad to do things (ex.When you issue the Search and Destroy order, they become aggressive and move ahead even if you're looking around, You can order them to set demolition charges on objectives to progress or you could order them to secure the area and plant the demolition charge yourself. You can even send them to sniper/anti-armor positions as well as turrets.)If you lose all your health, you get downed and the game doesn't end until your entire squad is downed. So while you're downed you could either tell them to maintain current orders (ex. search and destroy) or order the closest squad member to revive you. There's also the option to load the last save while you're downed. There's also quicksaves, I hotkeyed mine to F1 and F3 because I can screw things up a lot. I don't think you can really get through this game without ordering your squad around. You take quite a bit of damage, even on medium difficulty. Just for future reference, don't run infront of your squad while they're firing a sniper or a anti-armor grenade. Bad things happen. . .All in all this game was great for it's time and pretty short if you know what you're doing. I just REALLY wish there was a sequal just because of the ending. . .			"

												The moment you boot up Republic Commando is the moment your realize this isn't your usual Star Wars games.Presented in a darker, militaristic tone, you're placed in the shoes of Boss, a freshly manufactured clone, whose the leader of a commando squad of four. The opening epitomizes the message of the game, that you're a soldier and you have to rely on your squad-mates- as a side-note, look up during the short scene on Kimino, that's the attention to detail this game has. The art-style is harsher and the droids have an threating growl to their voices (♥♥♥♥ those whiny voices Lucas went with). It certainly feels unique since it uses its own soundtrack instead of constantly using John Williams pieces as a crutch. Stylistically, the game is beautiful, with a absolutely rocking soundtrack that knows when to throw in those vocals and drum-beats. Graphically, it's a 2005 game and console port, at 60 fps and proper lighting it's better than the original xbox version for sure. However, I believe it's the art-style instead of the textures that carries the visual direction. The actual gameplay harkens back to Rainbow Six with how you use your AI partners to clear levels and focus fire. Some of my favorite aspects of the game are the fact that you can 'prep' for battle. You can order a sniper to sit back or have one of your guys bombard the enemy from grenadier nest. Now you can only do this through context sensitive actions, but it's more a feature of the level design that rewards player thought than a ""you can only proceed after using a laser-designated airstrike on these helpless sand people"".The AI is very compentent too. They will require revival, but that's only on the hardest sections of the game. I never felt like they were idiotic, and actually they keep up with you extremely well. It's no F.E.A.R, but for a squad-based shooter, the AI never failed me on the several play-throughs I've had both past and present.Augmenting this squad is your own weaponry. The standard blaster is honestly a peashooter to me, but you get a mother♥♥♥♥ing shotgun in a Star-wars game, and it is god-damn awesome. The standard blaster can be switched to both a sniper rifle and an anti-tank grenade launcher, allowing to have a total of four weapons (one weapon you can pick up from an enemy soldier) with three types of grenades. You also have a blade-fist, and like Halo, your melee attack is brutal and effective in close-combat. In total, you have a solution for every problem and ammo is given often enough to use all your tools while given sparingly enough to not go willy-nilly with sniper and rpg shots.This game has become one of my favorite Star Wars games mostly because of the characters and story. Your three squad-mates have plenty of memorable quips and though they were stereotypical in their personalities, they give that Star Wars flair that prevents the game from being a super grim-dark slog. I'd never consider them annoying and by the end of the game you really detect how the characters have become more brothers than comrades-at-arms.  Story-wise you get some background information on some of the Clone-war plot-lines from the Prequels. However you never have a moment where it overly masturbates over the prequels' storylines or characters, it plays it straight and the only time you ever see a truly iconic character from Star Wars is once. RC is it's own game and story inside the Star Wars universe and I really admire that. It doesn't need Han Solo or Luke Skywalker to be a Star Wars game. And the aforementioned moment actually comes as a real reward to an honestly disappointing ending. A pat on the back for working through the difficult sections of RC.However I have my misgivings with RC. For one it's short. Not any shorter than an average FPS campaign of today, but at the time it was a very short game. There are only a handful of worlds to go to. Although the finales end with a bang (the Republic Ghostship's final mission has the most badass ending setpiece I've ever seen in a Star Wars game), they aren't extremely varied. You're going to be inside military compounds with only a few examples having open level design (these often have squad-points where you can assign snipers and grenadiers). There will be a few stretches where you have to go down a narrow corridor. Fighting waves of enemies. Ho-humming your way along. It'd be an injustice if I didn't emphasis a 'few' though. Most often the game gives you options and some cool set-piece battles to command through.The game can also be back-breakingly hard at points. I like this, but sometimes you'll get super-bullet spongy enemies (the reason why the main blaster feels ♥♥♥♥♥♥) back to back. The super-battle droids are the worst offenders. We're talking fighting up to six of those ♥♥♥♥ers at once, in a bare-knuckled shoot-out. On harder difficulties, this can make the game undeniably frustrating. Which turns those glorious finales into a sweat-inducing curse-ridden rant.Also no sequel. When you finish this game, you will agree that it ends at the worst moment. It doesn't feel unfinished due to just how badass the ending finale is. I mean there's a stretch that basically deconstructs the entire premise of the game and makes you realize just how important your squad is. But story-wise, you'll have to read a book to ever see the end of the Republic Commando series. And honestly, the book was 'meh' like most video game books.The squad gameplay can be a bit disappointing at times. It's more arcadey than realistic, and sometimes the squadmates are there to just hide how bullet-spongy the enemies are. I'd have liked to be able to always have a guy with his sniper-rifle out rather than them having to setup. I'd also have liked to have the squad mates use grenades more often or engage in melee instead of using those aforementioned blasters. Asking them to switch to shotguns would've been the best damn thing too. But every complaint I have with the game ends with a 'however'. The squad gameplay can be meh, however the way the game uses the squad adds extreme weight to the narrative and tone. The story is abrupt, however it has so many moments in the game that have struck with me for a damn decade. The levels aren't varied, however they really give that ""behind enemy lines blowing up their♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; feeling.For $10.00, you get a game that I would mention in the same breath as KotOR 1&2 and Jedi Outcast. It's not just a great Star Wars game, it's a game I would recommend to people that know nothing about the universe. It's a game I would play even if I wasn't in the mood for a Star Wars fix. This was a work of passion for the devs, who used Star Wars as a vehicle to tell a story of cooperation and brotherhood more through the gameplay than cutscenes.EDIT: Some things I forgot to mentioned or worded poorly. For one the AI of the squadmates is competent, but the enemy droids are as dumb as they are in the Prequels. Only the Super Battle Droid or Droideka pose any threat due to their bullet-spongey nature and their constantly attacking AI pattern. An enemy force you encounter later mixes things up, but their use of cover is only so effective and they do have a habit of mixing effective tactics with standing in the open.As a whole though, the enemy variety is noteworthy. Each major faction in the Clone Wars (as were present up to episode III) is represented and has units that are both cannon fodder and those that require squad focus fire. The enemy forces are gradually changed out and each world introducing a new faction that is better than the one before. Better armored, armed, and tactical. You'll never meet a force that can truly match your Commandos, but the array or melee and ranged enemies is remarkable for such a short game. Also, there is multiplayer in RC. Do I play it? Well, once or twice. It's a deathmatch arena game in the style of older shooters. Make of that what you will.			"

Tl'dr version:  One of the best Star Wars games out there. To this day, an underrated and often overlooked part of the evolution of squad based shooters; also included is a fantastic soundtrack.Great, (for the most part) A.I, and likeable squad mates make this short, but engaging ride all the sweeterElaborated version: I often find that people have a tendency to harp on about SW: Battlefront and KOTOR a little bit too much. They were great games, (especially the latter) but I found them to be deeply flawed games. SW: Republic Commando, while flawed in some ways, manages to pull everything together in a much more satisfying way. This is obviously due to it's genre, and the nature of the mission structure. Not a thing is out of place. This comes at price however; the mission structure is disjointed to say the least, and the story is bare bones. However you'll get the feeling this was deliberate, as just like in real combat, and especially if you're a 'slightly less expendable' clone, you'll not be kept up to the date with the war as a whole. The game will take it tacitly that you know the Star Wars lore already and fling references to the films at you without guilt or trepidation. For a avid SW fan this wont be a problem, I unfortunately found myself lost at some points in the dialogue.  The mechanics are just as you expect from a Squad shooter; intuitive, tight, and easy to control. The PC version runs great with a M&C set up, but a controller is also possible. It might be necessary to have button mapping software however, as the games age breaks the controls. You squad mates don't need you to hold their hand, and can perform simple tasks without you needing to give the order. However, they will occasionally rush in a 'no win scenario' and be dropped in matter of seconds under a hail of plasma fire. This will happen to you over and over, and their really is no way to stop it happening. This does have the unintended use of keeping aggro off you, while you attend to other matters. The game features the modern invent system of the FPS. That is to say. You're limited to two normal weapons, 1 special weapon, and multiple attachments to your assault rifle, thus giving the weapon variety a much needed boost. There is a weapon for every scenario. Now, onto the soundtrack. As a avid collector of game Soundtracks, this would have a proud spot on my list. In short; it's fantastic. A mixture of choral, and star wars symphony tropes mixed together to create a chilling, but engaging and epic theme. Definitely worth getting on soundtrack.Finally, onto the negatives, and they are surprisingly few. The game is no looker, and is really showing it's age as of 2015. However, over a decade on and it's vista's are still rather eye catching, especially the later missions on Kashyyyk. Also, while I said the A.I was great; that was for last decade. Now not so much. Your squad mates will get stuck on geometry and regularly fail to revive you, even if their aren't any enemies in the area. This is all forgiven however by the amazing squad dynamic of banter that is constantly being thrown around. Very rarely will you actually care what your objective is, but you'll genuinely like and care for your squad as the game progresses, and you feel like this is a family. Final thoughts: By no means a looker, and to modern audiences this game might feel slightly lost in why this game was so great back in the day, however I still recommend giving it a try if it comes on sale. Everything is here:• Great Combat• Great Characters• Great Soundtrack• Reasonable length.*Be aware however, the MP for the game has been shut down.*			"

												Well  Star Wars Republic Commando is imo one of the best Star Wars games out their....may even be better then Battlefront 2 or Knights of the old republic but damn that's a hard choice. All Star Wars games are awesome. But back to  Star Wars Republic Commando.It is such a badass game. You get to command 3 Squad mates while  battling your way though the galaxy on geonosis,A creepy♥♥♥♥♥spaceship,(That level still gives me the creeps), and kashyyyk.While at the same time getting a bunch of sweet cool weapons and fighting a bunch of cool enemies. Sadly their isn't any 4 player Co op but i'm pretty sure their is or someone is gonna make a mod for that.(I hope)In general you should buy it. Star Wars fan or not buy it. Like FPS Games? Buy it. Like Star wars? ♥♥♥♥ing Buy it.All in all 10/10 One of the best games ever made imo.			"

												One of the better Star Wars games out there. I despise the prequel trilogy, yet I still found this game to be quite good. It's an FPS where you play as the leader of an elite squad of commandos sent on the toughest of jobs.You can position your squad members, each one is supposedly skilled at different tasks, and it's mostly just blasting your way through droids and bugs in caverns, facilities, and space ships. You get the typical weapons--shotguns, pistols, sniper, rifle, etc. mostly in star-wars-style laser blasting form. It's about ten hours long, and it's a pretty good campaign with some neat set-pieces. The squad members have some fun personalities and the voice work is solid. Since it's an older game, there are no iron sights, so that might be hard to get used to. The graphics hold up well, although I do believe it lacks widescreen.

												On the timeline of great FPS games, Republic Commando sadly lurks in the shadow of the classics, but outdoes them in many respects. This Metroid Prime-inspired and slightly darker take on the Star Wars mythos puts you right in the shoes of a squad of covert Republic infiltrators carrying out a series of increasingly tense missions in tightly designed levels. A cohesive package of sound, graphics, and story that coalesce to form one of the ofter overlooked masterpieces of the genre.			"

												What a shooter. Other than a little short, I can't see anything bad to say about this. Maybe a bit too much of lonely time, but it makes up in other areas. A brilliant mix of just a bit of Rainbow Six and a lot of Halo, but in the Star Wars universe. There is something that I can't put my finger on, but at least for me it works quite nicely. Either that or the famous Nostalgia Goggles.			"

												EA, Disney, and LucasArts could quite literally make 100 million dollars by releasing a sequel for this game.Unfortunately, they're too busy releasing a washed out version of Battlefront.Updated 13.10.2015Like i thought, after playing the Battlefront Beta it's now clear that the game is absolute garbage. It's boring, cookie cutter shooter where you just spawn, run forward, kill everything you see and repeat. It might be ""fun"" for the first 30 minutes but after that you'll probably get bored and move to some other more mechanically interesting title. There are also dramatically less features than in the original two games, it was also announced today that they are going to be releasing a 50€ Season Pass for the game which will provide early access to future content for buyers etc.Now, business practices like this are terrible for the gaming industry. There is absolutely no way you can defend it without sounding like a sheep. Then again, i probably wouldn't be too♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about it if they actually released even half of the content that was already introduced in the Battlefront games more than 10 years ago.So, getting back to Republic Commando. It's still a great game, instead of buying Battlefront get this game instead. You certainly won't waste your money that way.			"

												No nonserious review this time, I can't think of anything.And here's my little info thing. Star Wars: Republic Commando is a tactical first-person shooter taking place in the prequel trilogy, or the Rise of the Empire Era, during a period of three to four years known as The Clone Wars, which is infact, my favorite part of Star Wars. Yes, get mad at me for liking the prequels. You play as Boss, a clone commando who leads Delta Squad, a squad of commandoes. There is Scorch, the explosives expert, Fixer, what you could call a hacker I guess, and Sev, the sniper.Time for the review part.Pros:+ First off, THE MUSIC. It's amazing!+ The graphics are quite good.+ The gameplay is decent, better than some other first person shooters.+ It has a good storyline, even though it's short. + Good voice acting+The characters are good. Cons:- Widescreen support has to be edited in.- Campaign is short.- Cliffhanger ending.Star Wars fan? Pick it up!Get's a 9/10 from me!			"

												Best FPS for Star Wars.Screw EA.Screw the new Battlefront.Play this game over and over.GG.In all seriousness, this game is a must buy for any Star Wars fan, even if you don't like the Clone Wars or the prequel movies. It's 1000x better than the new Battlefront game.You control Delta squad, a group of four clone commandos, Delta Sev, Delta Scorch, Delta Fixer, and you, Delta Boss, the leader of the squad. You fight your way through battledroids, super battledroids, droidekas, spider droids, flyings things that try to suck on your head, Magna Guards, Geonosians, and even lizards. It's true, the campaign is fairly short and multiplayer doesn't work anymore, but guess what. Those 9 ish hours were the best 9 hours of my life! I recommend this game 100%.

												I absolutely love this game! It shows how awesome the Clone Commandos are and is great because there are absolutely no Jedi! I'd like to say real quickly that if you want this game and are leery because it says 'blood and gore,' don't be worried. There is a little blood, but not much (most of it is green alien blood); and the 'gore' is nothing to worry about. There is also just a bit of language as well. The campaigns are great! I love the weaponry options in the game, and the commands you give the Commandos are easy to use and understand. For being an 11-year-old game, IT IS FREAKIN' AWESOME! Last note about the game: The multiplayer does not work because the company that hosts the server shut down a few years ago.			"

												I remember playing this game way back on the original Xbox. It's not through rose-colored glasses that I say this is the greatest squad-based shooter I've ever played.Let's start with the atmosphere. It's spot on. Any casual Star Wars fan will recognize most of the enemies and locations. The level and character designs are grittier than what you see in the movies, and that fits the tone perfectly. The HUD is one of the best I've ever seen, because YOU SEE THE BORDERS OF YOUR HELMET! Such a simple design choice affects your immersion immensely.So everything around you is cool. What about the combat? This game FEELS great. The modular weapons system is genius.  The squad commands are easy to learn but hard to master. The difficulty is pleasantly challenging; don't expect yourself to be repeating tons of levels, but do expect to be constantly searching for health and ammo. The weapons feel rewarding to use, and above all, the squad-based combat is amazing. You FEEL bad♥♥♥♥♥ You FEEL like it's you four protagonists against the world. And you WANT to take 'em all on.Your three Clone Commando compatriots, Scorch, Fixer, and Sev, are exceptional AI companions (especially for 2005). They are effective in combat, respond to commands instantly, and generally don't make the kind of dumb decisions that make you rage at AI companions. They don't talk much, but you can still feel personality emanating from them.On the note of character, the one category where this game falters is story. You know where you are, and you know why. You have objectives. But that's about it. The characters don't change over time. There are no plot twists. There is an instance of tragic loss (I won't spoil it for you), and it hits you hard. But there is room for improvement in that area.Besides the story, what other improvements could be made? I won't comment on the graphics, because this game is coming up on 10 years old, but I will say they've aged well. The only thing that springs to mind is the level design. Don't get me wrong, the levels are designed fine, but it gives away what's to come. When you see a spot where you can issue a sniping command, you know there's enemies directly ahead. Health and ammo are always located directly behind large groups of enemies. It's textbook old-fashioned level design, but you always know what's coming.One final point: because this is an older game, a 1920x1080 aspect ratio is not an option it offers. It's a minor detail, but an important one.In conclusion, ten years later, this is still an incredible game. Although the story is never going to be a selling point, everything else about this game is great. It feels like you're taking a first-person trip through the summer action film spectacular that Star Wars never had. I highly recommend it to anyone who puts gameplay ahead of graphics. Amongst the vast troves of LucasArts treasures, this gem certainly shines bright.			"

												Yes, the first few missions may be dull: Slice this, snipe that and so on. But that isn't the point. The point is, you need to work as a team. Sure, I may be a Star Wars fan myself but this doesn't affect my opinion on this fantasic game. To the people who say the graphics make up the game entirely, just do yourself a favour and don't play a single game for the rest of your life. Sure, the graphics in this game aren't up to scratch with today's standards but they sure were back in the good days of 2005. To be honest, I think they're great! The gameplay and story line is simply amazing. It brings you back to Geonosis, Kashyyk, an abandoned Republic Cruiser and a few other places. I don't think there is another Commando game out there that is based on Star Wars. But if there is, this has got to be one of the best around. I spent heaps of time playing Star Wars Battlefront 1 & 2 and let me tell you, those are amazing games too. The squad that you play with is also very responsive and helpful (unlike in many other games). They'll do what you tell them to do. No questions asked. Unless they are under heavy fire and it is protocol-wise required to defeat the enemy first (goddammit just revive me already haha). Scorch really does keep the squad alive with his 'jokes', athough he can say it the wrong times.But too bad Lucas Arts and Pandemic have left the Star Wars games, they were doing a fantastic job. Anyway, overall this is a fantastic game and I hope it won't be forgotten. If you are looking for a multiplayer, try going to Star Wars Battlefront 2. That is also an amazing game. I'll give it 9.5/10. Buy it already if you haven't! Have fun! :)			"

This is one of the finest Star Wars games as well as one of the best FPS shooters of its time; heck, it's 2016 and it's still mindblowing how much of a quality game Republic Commando is.My only wish for this game is for it to be remastered. Take whatever DICE did with graphics and sound for BATTLEFRONT and apply it to this game, add up to 4 player co-op and reboot the servers for multiplayer skirmishes, add a couple of extra gamemodes like wave survival and extraction and I can guarantee that it would sell like hotcakes.

												After completing this game I can gladly say that this is a game that needs a sequel.This game follows Delta Squad. You are the leader, Delta-38 Boss. Your squad consists of Delta-07 Sev, Delta-40 Fixer, and Delta-62 Scorch. The chemistry between these characters is unlike any other game I have seen.  Sev is the most badass Clone I have ever seen. Scorch is a querky, funny joker. Fixer is a very self centered man. He has basically no personality besides a few funny quotes here and there. This game is very short. It consists of 3 ""Chapters"". Geonosis, RAS Prosecutor, and Kashyyyk. In all I rate this game 9/10. The game's story is very good, the only thing I can find bad about this game is that the firefights can sometimes be very bland and boring.			"

Your team, Delta, is formed by 4 RC clone commandos:-1138 (Boss, squad-leader, that is You)-1262 (Scorch, demolitions)-1207 (Sev, sniper)-1140 (Fixer, tech expert)It is rather great to give individual orders to this team simulating a spec op team behind enemy lines into a Star Wars universe. This feature gives the game uniqueness. For this reason I do recommend it to anyone who loves Star Wars.Thanks for reading.			"

												Don't let my hours fool you, I've completed this game nearly 3 times over. This game is frankly one of the greatest Star Wars games out there. Republic Commando puts you in the boots of (you guessed it) a clone commando, with 3 squadmates. You travel to locations like Geonosis, Kashyyyk, and an abandoned Republic ship. This game focuses on squadwork, while you or another squadmate is arming a charge to get into a locked door, the other 3 are stopping the super battle droid shooting at you (which are actually kinda intimidating in this game). This is an older game, but you will still be impressed with the graphics to a degree, and at the not-as-expensive-as-98%-of-all-fps-shooters-out-there price of $10, I believe that this quality game is well worth your money!

												-played for years not using steam-My undisputed favorite game of all time. Amazing game-play and squad controls plus an immersive world create a memorable campaign leaving you longing for more. The worlds and characters you meet along the way are varied. Enemies have distinct faults you can exploit to defeat them. Voice acting and level design are both fantastic and add to the great campaign. Your squad has AI way ahead of its time and for once you don't grow tired of them. Instead you develop a weird sense of attachment to each of their unique personalities. Beyond being my favorite single player game it was also my go to for multiplayer* in which it molded arena combat and amazing maps to create a fantastic experience.*multiplayer servers are down and there are many issues when trying to bypass that with the steam version.Pros:Game-playVoice acting immersionSquadCharactersWorld/lvl designenemiesplotCons:Servers for multiplayer are down9.75/10			"

												This game can be truly called one of the best StarWars action games, it was so good, I can't tell it was innovative, but it simply accumulated every single possible best concept of the action games and perfectly served them:+Visuals: Despite the fact that this game is old as hell, it's still beautiful. The character designs, the hud, all the effects are very well made gun designs. Everything was designed so well that you could nearly touch that feeling of how to be a Republic Commando.+Soundwork: The whole SW franchise is famous for great sound work in every single game, this game is no exception.+Gameplay: And now to the best part -this game offers a unique experience - how does it feel to be a part of the Clone Squad, amazing AI of your clone friends, different roles of each person, command each of your team members and its really easy to control them, so it's a pleasure to play even with bots, and on top of that you had+Multiplayer: So you can squad up with your friends for the Republic glory.All the characters feel so alive, I couldn't get enough of this game back in 10 years ago. You may see some rеtаrded comments that this game is underrated, it's all lies, you can't find a single person that would say that this game is bad or even mediocre if you'll see something like that it's either a troll or a very ill person.

												This game has been one of my favorite games since it came out over a decade ago. Without a doubt it still holds it's own in this gaming generation. There are no force powers, and no jedi lightsaber battles. This is all about a badass clone commando squad, the experience is unique and awesome. It deserves a sequel.			"

												So, ive been a gamer all my life especially with FPS games, I started with halo in 2000, and moved to Call of duty, with the occasional Battlfield, in all my 20 YEARS of gaming, there has been no other first person shooter that has touched me the same way PERIOD. The story is compelling, deep and emotional having you go through real struggles. The gameplay is fluid, and smooth, better than any other first person shooter, and ive played : Halo 1 through 4, Call of duty : 1 through 4 Modern warfare 1 through 3 Battlefield 1942, 2142, battlefield 2, 3. This game TRUMPS THEM ALL. Commanding the commandos is easy to understand and simple without interrupting the gameplay flow. The amount of weapons is a comfortable amount that give you versatility without bogging you down. The commandos are like real people with thier commentary and feedback! Its also actually difficult, you dont regenerate health, the enemies are harder but not unfair, you dont get unrealistic amounts of ammo, and the scenarios are down to earth and feel like solid military situations that could come up. I cant rate this game high enough it holds the top 3 star wars games ive ever played. P.S its not 3rd i just couldnt pick a number 1 haha. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game you wont regret it.			"

												This game may be old, as it was made over 10 years ago (2005), but, it still is today my all time favourite FPS and Star Wars game. This game puts you into the feet of an elite republic commando squad leader, only by the name of 'Boss: 38' (Voiced by the same person who voiced Jango Fett). He has three other clones in his squad, 'Sev: 07' (The Sniper), 'Fixer: 40' (The Hacker) and last but  deffinitly not least 'Scorch: 62' (The Demolishion, and my favourite clone in the game), who all take place in 'Delta Sqaud'. Campaign is FANTASTIC, AWESOME storyline, with amazing characters. Unfortunatly, multiplayer no longer works, but you can still system link with ur friends and enjoy tring to kill each other.All in all, this is an amazing game, I 100% recomand this game to all of you, AND IT'S ONLY $10. 11/10: BEST GAME EVER (or at least in my opinion) 100% GET THIS GAME, NOW, OR I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN IN MY RREPUBLIC COMMANDO OUTFIT AND KILL YOU, ok maybe that went to far, but stil, GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ""JUST DO IT!!!!!!!""Thanks for reading and I hope you get this game.Kind Regards: TouchTheRazor			"

												This game hold a unique place amongst the Star Wars games. There are no lightsabers, you don't have the force, you only have Delta Squad. The gunplay is fun, the gameplay is very interesting and challenging, and the AI is actually decent. In Republic Commando your squad of Commandos are not just fodder to absorb fire for you. They are good at killing, they can be deployed into a variety of tactical positions and be given a variety of orders, they get hurt, and they can be taken down. In the event you are taken down, they can actually help you up, which is pretty impressive. Another difference this game has from other Star Wars games is it's decidedly darker tone, as you aren't hanging out in the nicest of places. After all, you are a soldier and you are definitely in the♥♥♥♥♥♥I cannot reccomend this game enough to fans of both Star Wars and FPS games.			"

												when i was 9 years old i saw this game while browsing on youtube and i really  wanted to play it but i didnt have a steam account so i couldnt really figure out how to play it, a few months ago i saw the game on sale and i decided to buy it just for the nostalgic childhood moments. I didnt expect the game to be fantastic, just a standard game with bad graphics because it was developed in 2005. But when i played the game i was really surprised, i didn't expect the game to be so good, when you look at it; the graphics are actually very good for a 2005 game, the story is amazing and the gameplay is very enjoyable. Because of the variety of different weapons there are options of playstyles for each individual person. and the ability to remotely control your teammates is very nice too, i just wish there was a sequel or a remake kind of thing, i would be very happy to see this game remade with modern day technology.

												For coming out in 2005 this game still is a thrill to go back and relive the ultimate Clone Special Ops experience. You will be tasked with dealing with the most elite and discreet Republic operations, and leading a group of 4 (including yourself) elite Clone soldiers called Commandos. To begin, the gameplay is really good for a 2005 game. The shooting action gets really intense in the latter part of the game, and you will have to learn how to manage your squads survival as well as your own. Get too caught up in keeping your squad fit, and your own health will fall and you will go unconscious. Focus too much on your own health and equipment, and your squad will be left without orders and ultimately end up dying. This ends up being a gameplay goal for you as you must balance the two in order to have a successful playthrough (unless you want to play on the easiest difficulty). Although this does end up becoming a problem when your squad completely goes against their own common sense and runs out into a crowd of a bunch of droids, guns blazing, and gets shot down within seconds. Your squad also tends to run in front of you as you're throwing a grenade, which is super annoying because it will take down your shields and your health, as well as your squad member's, and you will still have enemies firing at you. I also feel the game is a little bit too difficult as you will find yourself screaming at your monitor on the Normal difficulty setting. Perhaps the developers could have balanced the difficulties by adding a fourth one (easy would still be easy, add a normal, normal would be hard, and hard would be very hard). But still, the game is still enjoyable despite the setbacks of a few gameplay issues. The guns are also nice. Most of them have decent sounds (other ones being laughable), and they have a good difference in purpose and power. The grenades, with the exception of the flash-bang grenade, are all pretty useful. Although none stand out above the other in the department of usefulness as they're all pretty much the same: aim at your enemy and throw. But still, they're a decent touch.The presentation is at an average level. With your standard graphics card you can max this game out, and the visuals won't look too bad. The textures are decent, and you won't really see any frame rate drop or texture pop-ins. The game overall has excellent environments that all differ from each other drastically. You'll go from fighting on the sandy and rocky world of Geonosis to the ""abandoned"" Republic ship in a matter of hours. With the varied environments and average graphics with no presentation technical difficulties, I can confidentially saw this game has above par presentation given its age.Now, onto the fun part, the content of Star Wars Republic Commando. First off, the story is really good. You are placed in command of Delta Squad, an elite group of Republic Commandos, which essentially are just Clone super soldiers. You will be given a variety of missions ranging from destroying a Droid Factory to helping the leader of the Wookies on Kashyyyk. Along the way you will unlock a few extras, which aren't really anything special, but they're a decent addition. The game is honestly too short. With the edition of another planet this game would have easily felt more complete. But the content that is there is fun and replayable, so it doesn't diminish the game too much. The multiplayer is remotely enjoyable, but will get old quickly. The community is either dead silent or a bunch of snotty veterans who trash talk new players and exploit the more powerful weapons. The maps themselves aren't anything out of the box, and quite bland, which is a shame considering the variety and design of the campaign maps were quite well. You'll most likely end up playing the campaign 1 or 2 times and maybe the multiplayer an hour or two (unless you find the multiplayer really fun, which I doubt most will).All in all I can say this game was a very good addition to the Star Wars franchise. Although it is a little short and has some gameplay issues and a below par multiplayer, you will find yourself thoroughly enjoying the amazing campaign and its awesome storytelling, environments, and characters. For the current price of $9.99 you should definitely pick this game up and relive or enjoy for the first time one of the greatest Star Wars gaming experiences you can possibly find.			"

												Republic Commando is a FANTASTIC game, one of the greatest Star Wars games ever made and unquestionably the best Star Wars first-person shooter ever made (I do not count Jedi Outcast or Jedi Academy, because the lightsabers kind of radically change those games to the point where they no longer really qualify). The squad AI is still incredibly good by today's standards, the characters are compelling and smartly-written, and the environments and story are original and creative.But I cannot openly recommend getting this on Steam without some qualifying statements.Republic Commando is an old game. A very old game. And it does not play nicely with newer computers. Problems with bumpmapping in the graphics can result in crashes, and trying to get it to run on a 64-bit Windows OS is a horrific struggle. If you have Windows 7 or 8 64-bit, Republic Commando may need to be sadly relegated to the history books. Hopefully your memories, if you got a chance to play it back in the day. You will likely not get another.EDIT: Ever since I upgraded to Windows 10, it's worked perfectly. I don't know what changed, but I hereby retract the preceding paragraph. In the interests of transparency, I will leave it up, but the compatibility issues probably won't affect you anymore.			"

												This may seem like an exaggeration, but Star Wars: Republic Commando may be the best game I've ever played. I am a huge Star Wars fan, and I actually found out about this game from the  tie-in novels [www.amazon.com]. I bought this game during a sale and mostly left it alone until recently. Now, after playing it for a few hours, I can confirm that it is everything that its small but fanatic cult following says it is.This depiction of the Star Wars universe is much darker than any other I've encountered before. Rather than following the heroic Jedi in an unrealistic ""good vs evil"" fight, Republic Commandos occupy that ""gray area"" and win their fights through brutal efficiency. In fact, Jedi don't even play a significant role in this game. Also, rather than showing typical sanitized Star Wars death (no blood), gratuitous amounts of gore frequently splatters the player's helmet (yay), which is eventually cleaned by a nifty windshield wiper-like device.Gameplay is heavily centered around a squad of four, where the leader is controlled by the player. Commands are given to the other three soldiers, consisting of a sniper, a demolitions expert, and a hacker. AI teammates are actually useful in this game without making it too easy for the player (take notes, Overkill). Each member can be told to perform certain tasks, such as manning a turret, blowing a door open, or providing sniper fire. Everything feels seamless and well-executed, especially the  door breach maneuver . #SquadGoalsGraphics are, well, 2005. Can't expect much. The resolution doesn't even go to 1080p. Thankfully, there are mods to fix that. They're good enough to create a reasonably immersive environment, but I'd like to think that it's the story and gameplay that makes this game what it is. The soundtrack fills in the rest of the atmosphere, which is a combination of John Williams glory and some original compositions. Good music is pretty much a given for anything Star Wars related.About the story (SPOILERS AHEAD): I haven't played through the entire game yet, but I've played enough and have read enough of the novels to get a sense of what's going on.Late in the game, one of the commandos, RC-1207 or ""Sev"", is left behind on the planet of Kashyyyk following a botched extraction. The game then ends on a cliffhanger regarding the fate of Sev. The game then ends on that cliffhanger. In the novel, Sev's former drill sergeant and father figure Kal Skirata then embarks on a long journey to find him. Unfortunately, thanks to LucasArts getting really messed up and its transition to Disney, both the sequel to this game and the sequel to  Imperial Commando [www.amazon.com] were cancelled. There have been rumors that  EA will release a sequel [www.technobuffalo.com] and that  Sev is alive [www.polygon.com]. However, they are only rumors that we can only hope are true. TL;DR: Underrated squad-based first person shooter with great mechanics and story. Give sequel pls			"

												One of the best Star Wars games I have ever played. You take the role of a Clone Commando unit which is basically the elite of the clone army. The game features unique squad commands that you can give to your squad members who are not operating on a stupid AI but actually good decision making that could make you recover from a stupid down and allows you finish the mission. The story is amazing, the atmosphere is superb, the graphics are a bit outdated but for a game that came out  in 2005 it still has lovely graphics. I can recommend this game to any Star Wars fan especially the ones who have interest in the Clone Wars era			"

												This game reminds me of a point in my youth that wasn't the greatest time. Didn't have a lot of money and didn't have a lot of things to do. My dad bought me this when it came out cuz I played the demo on one of the Star Wars movies. This game was incredible. What do you get:Better squad interaction than 90% of games today with better personalities too. Solid shooting with an adaptive weapon system and enjoyable weapon pick ups from enemies. Level design is fun and in some places the tension is extremely high as blaster fire is pounding off your cover. You feel like a real commando going against brutal odds and sabotaging enemy lines. And an ending that will make you yell at your screen in a good way, none of that cliffhanger insert sequel here nonsense.			"

-Quick Review-Star Wars Republic Commando is a squad based FPS set in the Star Wars universe right at the start of the Battle of Geonosis and ending right at the battle for Kashyyyk. Republic Commando was developed by LucasArts and released March 1, 2005.

-Detailed breakdown review-Story: You join up with the Delta Squad, an elite group of clones whom have been cloned from the Mandalorian Bounty Hunter Jango Fett. They were also hand picked by Jango Fett to become commando's. The Delta Squad batch of clones were all raised in the same pod group, they're actually one of the closest knit clone groups.Okay PAUSE the review... I personally already had a vested interest in this game because I've read several of the Author Karen Traviss' Republic Commando Books. While Disney (and George Lucas) no longer accepts these books as cannon... ...Don't get me started, I'm just going to accept it and move on.I still prefer the ties between the series. That said, there's a lot of additional character development given to the Delta Squad from her books. Honestly the Nulls are way better, ORDO ALL THE WAY BABY! ..but I digress.


RC-1140 (Fixer... In the Green), RC-1207 (Sev... in the Red), and RC-1262 (Scorch... in the Yellow).

The four Delta Characters are RC-1140 (Fixer), RC-1207 (Sev), and RC-1262 (Scorch) and you play as RC-1138 (Boss). Here's another reason to respect the game developers, the voice actor for Boss is the actual actor for Jango Fett himself: Temuera Morrison.(However each clone should have his voice, but the game developers gave all of the clones voiced different voice actors... Lets just pretend this is how they hear each other differently, because in Karen Traviss' Books they knew the difference between eachothers voices, but it was only clones and people who got to know them on a personal level would notice the subtle differences. ....aaaaaand it would be very difficult for a gamer to notice difference between the clones voices, let alone instructing a voice actor to change their voice just enough to be different.... BAH. It's complicated, just know I thought about it and attempted to explain it.)Anyway, to recap with less words: Republic Commando story on it's own is kind of shallow because there's very little character development. HOWEVER if you go read the Republic Commando Book series from Karen Traviss then you'll have a whole new level of appreciation for each of these clones.Multiplayer:Just a quick note about the multiplayer, it's gone. Since Gamespy was shut down the servers aren't there. There might still be communities and mod's which you can use to play it with other people though.Gameplay: Before I jump right in and explain the gameplay, lets fix something real quick. When you boot the game the resolution will probably be all wrong, and your mouse will probably be traveling lightspeed all over the screen if you full screen it (ALT + Enter)This guide helped me fix it.Basically you want to open your console mode with your Tilda key: ~ and then type in:setres 1920x1200setmousesensitivity 0.5Even then my mouse moved super fast, and would just use arrow keys to navigate menu's... but it makes the game much more playable. (Final side note: you need to join a game before you can get into the console commands, you can start a LAN game, or jump into a single player campaign game)You have all of the features of a standard FPS in this game, fire, zoom, crouch. The buttons are a wee bit weird at times, like you zoom with Z, and you throw grenades with your right mouse button throws a grenade. (Yeah, that was an unpleasant discovery. I was looking at a wall when I did that.)You Can jump too... but you really won't use that, you also can't sprint... it's the reverse, if you hit shift you move slower. Both of those were weird design choices, but I'm just going to blame it on being the 2000's when this game came out. We're probably lucky it turned out as well as it did.I think it's pretty safe to say most people have played FPS before, and so you come to expect easy and medium difficulties to be relatively challengeless and the only real challenge come from hard mode onward... This is not the case for Republic Commando, I played on medium difficulty (I didn't notice you could change the difficulty until I was half way through, and there's no way I'm switching difficulty half way through a game. Forget that noise.)Most of the challenge in this game comes from the team-oriented gameplay and game design. I normally exploited the AI's design, and let my team mates be cannon fodder while I set bombs, or knifed battle droids in the back of their armor plates... but even with that advantage the game can be down right brutally difficult. Especially if you run out of ammo! Which happened more frequently then I'd like to admit. (I became very well antiquated with the melee button... which is E by the way)


Campaign Mission Selection Map. It averages about 5 levels per planet/ship. For a total game time of 10 hours, that's pretty decent.

By: Atratzu




There's about 5 levels on each world, I took roughly 10 hours to play through the whole game, and in my opinion hearing the song ""Vode An"" and a few Mando'a words and curses was definitely worth the price of admission for me.Conclusion: I really enjoyed my time spent with Republic Commando, unfortunately I'm disappointed there wasn't really any character development, the controls were awkward at times, and the technical problems you're bound to have with older titles.I was very pleased with the Mando'a tribe, the cutscenes, and the effort given to small details which Fandalorians will definitely pick up on and after hearing Vode An I realized I have a new ringtone for my phone.I hate to say it, but I don't think Republic Commando will appeal to everyone equally. But that being said anyone who enjoyed the clone wars era of star wars, and especially anyone who has read Karen Traviss' books should totally check this game out.Oya Manda!			"

												Bought this game when it was on sale. I loved it when I was a kid, so I thought I'll have it in my library, never intending to actually replay it. But then I thought I should give it a go just for fun. Oh wow, after all these years it's still fun to play! There's something special about this game that even the modern games lack off. And I think this is the only good thing that came out of the prequels (this and the Mr.Plinkett review).

												Tinkering might be needed.I needed to set ""bump"" setting in the video option to low. Then I could set everything else to highest.  Otherwise it would crash (Found this inf. on the internets).So now that I am 90 minutes into it I can see why everyone loved this game. Its a solid FPS. The guns are not great but the action is exciting, the voice acting is sooo much better than today's crappy FPS games. The music is awesome.  Your NPC buddies are kick **s. The world is simple old lo res but full of atmosphere.  It's smooth.  I'm enjoying it... It's supposed to be about 10 hours which is fine with me. It's too dated for me to put more then 10 hours into it. But it's more then worth a $1 per hour.  For instance, I managed to enjoy shadow of mordor (at least the killing chieftans) because of cutting edge animations and fun high res combat ** DESPITE the horrible  generic characters, awful forgettable plot lines, dreary music,  and repetitive environments. This game you will get as muchvalue for your money. The combat animations suck and the shooting is not the greatest(but it's OK - and there is some tactical parts) but the GAME as a whole is well conceived and extremely well executed. It's better than the AAA titles of the modern era. **I know Mordor is not a FPS so the comparison is not 1:1 but it's the last game I played and the most ""new"" and slickest game to have been released so I'm just comparing value and I'm making a case for trying out this dated title.

I love how it starts on Geonosis at the beginning of the Clone Wars in the 2nd movie, ""Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones"" and ends around the time of the Separatist Invasion of the Wookie homeworld Kashyyyk in the 3rd movie, ""Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith"". It is an awesome and excellent First-Person Shooter game for being made in 2005!			"

The game its self if a nice twist from the star wars games you know. Star Wars republic commando is a gritty, exciting, and bloody first person shooter with a nice team based mechanic in it. The game can be challenging at times and i found myself running out of ammo and from time to time be resorted to using my pistol. I would rate this game 8/10			"

												Finally, some external marketing of Star Wars that does the franchise perfect justice.This game may be older, but it's one of the greatest and still relevant shooters I've played today.Tired of the jedis? Or massive Battlefront-style unit management? Take control of Delta Squad: an elite group of clones who all have their own specialties to bring to the team, and personalities that play well off one another in the amsuing dialouge.The shooting feels pretty good. Enemies die in a lot of visually pleasing and hilarious ways, keeping the good cartoon/serious balance Star Wars is known for. While there's a dissapointing variety of guns, the ones you have suit you very well.As Delta Squad's leader, you take advantage of ""squad commands"". Split up your three squad members to take up sniper positions, heal themselves, hack consoles, breach doors, blow things up, and a variety of helpful things. All these commands are administered and canceled with suprising ease, and the AI is FANTASTIC at fending for themselves and executing orders.Almost shameful to say that your team AI is better than most cooperative shooter-style games on the market today.You only play through three worlds. While the game isn't longer than eight or so hours, it's one long thrill-ride that is action packed with appropriate breathing room. Nothing's more intense than when you're the last of your squad not incapacitated and there's a pod dispensing Super Battle Droids infront of you.There's multiplayer. It's standard deathmatch and CTF type gamemodes. It's nothing special and nobody really plays it anymore.TL;DR?FANTASTIC shooter, very unique, BLEEDS Star Wars atmosphere, entertaining and likable characterss, and holds up as one of the greatest shooters and Star Wars games today. What's not to like?			"

Superb voice acting, epic set pieces, pulse pounding action, it does it all very well. Some games have bad pacing, feel like corridor shooters, or don't do the shooting mechanics very well, but this game manages to avoid those problems. SWRC doesn't have a huge arsenal, but the weapons feel good to use. The main characters are also very endearing.			"

But the point is Sev isnt dead, he just says he is under heavy fire, witch if you have played this game for long, you know happens alot and a commando can take care of it.

It feels at home with today's FPS, only slower.Great multiplayer (now if we could get more people to play it online.)Great story, and they don't take much of your time.Intense gameplay, with quick desicion making action from full on attack and support, to revive you and turret cover.

												Even as an old game, it's simply brilliant and brilliantly simple.Even on the easiest difficulty, it's extremely difficult.Republic Commando takes place during my favorite point in Star Wars history, the Clone Wars, and provides an interesting story that provides a few layers of depth to the Grand Army of the Republic. Unlike most shooters, such as Battlefield and Child Online Daycare, your weapon isn't the strongest thing you have (in fact, it's kind of weak sometimes) - it's your squad. When presented with seemingly-unstoppable enemies such as droidekas and super battle droids, you'll need every single rifle aimed at the target. You cannot just blitz through the levels, like you can in most games. It requires a lot of skill and coordination, that both add up to make Republic Commando a very challenging game,  but also a really fun one.			"

												In my opinion Star Wars Republic Commando has to be one of the best first-person shooters made to date. This is because:1. The combat feels great! running at a group of droids firing away at you with just the right amount of accuracy to be a threat and then dispatching them one by one with your wristblade is one of the best experiences in gaming!2. The Team. Your team is made up of 4 people (no spoilers, as you find this all out in the opening) you, the elite Delta 38, the sniper Sev (Delta 07), the hot headed demolitions expert scorch (Delta 62), and the trustworthy commando fixer (Delta 40). Your command over them is relatively limited as you only have 4 options, Search and destroy, Form up, Stay here and Do thing (sniper point, grenade point, breach door, hack, etc) Also if you ""die"" your squad will carry on fighting until finished and then will revive you with half health (you can order them to revive you sooner but that often puts them in a very vulnerable spot).3.The environments, without spoiling the game for you the envoronments range from full on battles with other troopers present to creepy environments with your enemies lurking around every other corner.4. The story. The story really attaches you mentally to your squad and by the end you'll be scolding scorch for shooting you in the back rather than cursing the AI, and there are some real moments of accomplishment in the story such as the end of the first ""chapter"". The ending is awesome too!.So to sum up, GO BUY THIS GAME!			"

												Republic Commando is a very good game, though due to the multiplayer servers being shut down your pretty much paying for a 8-10 hour campagin. (Hamachi, Gameranger, and Orgin can be used to play multiplayer but I am unaware of how much people play)This is currently the only Tactical Star Wars shooter to date so compared to other Star Wars shooters out there it is very good and refreshing for me.Pros: Very good AI teammates.Good ways to make use of the enviroment tactically. The health system is nice, not too easy like regeneration nor not too hard like health pickups.Great Variety of enemies, Super Battle Droids fight like a super battle droid would. They get a bonus for making standard battle droids look somewhat more menecing.Intresting Story.Gun Fights feel like real tactical gun fights.Realistic Door Breaching and squad teamwork.Cons:The design of the Commandos is odd for me, they look too ""super human"" if you will.The campagin is only 8-10 hours and it is really the only thing your getting.Trandoshon weapons resemble real world gunpowder firearms way too much for my liking.Despite being short the way the levels of the campagin are designed makes you feel like your grinding in some areas.For those wondering...IS THIS GAME'S STORY CANON? (SPOILERS)For the most part no, anything that was not the Movies or the Clone Wars animated series were never really canon and they everything that was not the movies or the clone wars series were offically decanonized by Lucasfilm after the company got sold. IS THE CHARACTERS, WEAPONS, AND OTHER ELEMENTS CANON?Some things yes, Delta Squad made an apperance in the Clone Wars animated series thus making them canon. The Trandoshon Shotgun also made an appearance in the Clone Wars along with it being in a EA's Star Wars Battlefront DLC named the ""scatter gun"" (loved using it in both games)Other things no, The follow up to Battle of Kashyyyk does not line up with how it happend in Revenge of the Sith (this was made prior to the movie so that is understandable)General Grevious resembles the 2003 cartoon so i'd assume if he had any lines in this he would sound like he did in that series thus making his role in this game non canon by default.In canon the Trandoshons do in fact use regular blasters and when their shotgun made an appearance in the Clone Wars it did not eject any shells.

												One of The Best Star Wars Game Ever, great story(ends a bit short, but that is because they were suppost to make a second one.), great gameplay, good guns, awesome sound, sound track in amzing. Really makes you feel part of a squad.  A lot more dark and gritty then other star wars games.  Justs a great shooter over all.Story: 5/5 (may end short, but has a good ending making you want a sequal so bad that you cry for years for not getting one)Gameplay: 5/5Game: 10/10  Game is awesome a must own.  Made my childhood.			"

												I can't get over how stunningly well this game holds up to the test of time.  I used to game away at Republic Commando when I was but a wee lad, though I never finished it because of that timed level at the end of the first act (let me just get it out of the way, that's probably the biggest doozy in this game).  I've since come back and completed it, but as a child, whoo, was that level rough.  If you can get past an occasional sharp difficulty curve through impressive strategy or dogged pursuit of your goals, you'll find this to be one of the most rewarding experiences you've ever had in a shooter.  It's polished, impressive, tense at parts, and will thrill you despite the limited mechanics.In summary, singlehandedly one of the greatest shooters I've ever played.			"

												Alright, this game is AWESOME.  Star Wars Republic Commando is an FPS based on the lives of Delta Squad, 4 elite clone commandos who are sent on the most dangerous and imperative missions the republic has to offer.  Each one has his own distinct personality and all 4 of them (you play as squad leader) are pretty likable characters.  Here are the commandos in order:38 ""three-eight"" aka ""Boss"" or ""Sir""- the squad leader and the player character. He is fully voiced by Temuera Morrison, the voice actor for Boba and Jango Fett in the films.  38 (said literally ""three-eight"")  is a no nonsense commander with a head for strategy and a dry sense of humor.  He leads the squad (obviously) and is able to issue orders to the other 3 commandos, for example, he can tell them to set up sniper positions, anti armor, mount turrets, use healing stations, etc.  (btw these are actual game mechanics, issueing orders to your squad is a huge part of the game).  He has all the weapons that the other 3 commandos are capable of wielding but unlike the others he is capable of using special, enemy weapons that can be found off certain foes.  40 ""four-oh"" aka ""Fixer""- Fixer is the tech specialist of the squad and specialises in hacking and computer interfaces, he is very useful for hacking terminals.  While all the commandos have the same skills and abilities, some are better than others at certain things.  For example, Fixer can hack faster than the others, Scorch is more accurate with grenades and can set explosives faster and Sev is a deadeye with a sniper rifle.  Fixer takes his job verrry seriously and doesn't talk about much other than the mission or how to accomplish it, but he does have moments where he loosens up.  Fixer is exceptional at melee combat and dispatches melee using foes with ease.  62 ""six-two"" aka ""Scorch""-  Scorch is the squad demolitionist and explosive expert and his outlook on life relfects that.  He loves danger and has a very positive, optimistic viewpoint on any sitution, using humor to deal with even the most harrowing of missions.  He is the squad funny guy and his upbeat personality is definitely helpful when things look grim.  Scorch's preferred weapon of choice is the anti-armor grenade launcher and grenades themselves.     07 ""oh-seven"" aka ""Sev""-  Sev is the designated marksman and stealth fighter of the squad and revels in war and battle.  He is a deadly sniper and the best shot in the squad (other than the player).  He is probably the most mandalorian out of the squad and by that I mean he lives for war.  62 finds his fervor for killing to be a bit creepy at times but he is a good soldier and a good friend... and a truly terrible enemy.  Sev's weapon of choice is the sniper rifle, which he uses with pinpoint accuracy.   The game's combat is pretty good and the squad AI is amazing even for today, the commandos feel very human and real.  The game even has multiplayer which I'm not sure if there is anyone on it anymore but it was good in its own way as well.  The story is pretty good and involving and gets pretty hectic at times which keeps things interesting.  All in all this is one of the best star wars games out there and I highly reccomend it for any star wars fan.  I know I spent most of this review talking about the characters, but I did so because they are  the game's strongest attribute.			"

												This is my all time favorite star wars game. Being able to play not just a clone soldier but a clone with a story. In the game you get to see the front lines in a whole new way. This isnt battle front where once you die your just respawned as a new clone and thrown on the battle field. In this game you have a team and you have to keep them moving along just as you must move along. It reminds me of a mix between the first Halo game and rainbow six vegas. All in all I love it and wish that a second were made.			"

Complete with a strong single-player experience, Delta 62 and 07's usual bantering, and a multiplayer that feels like Unreal Tournament without vehicles. MP is still pretty fun at times, though. Also, it has that hard-as-nails Kashyyyk mission.Yes.THAT Kashyyyk mission.			"

												It's really good, gameplay is good, A.I can be stupid sometimes but telling them to form up or to hold a position can fix their positioning. It's a good game.Pros- -Squad combat is good (their accuracy and damage can be bad at times however) -Multiple weapon types that feel different- Good story - Your squad actually has character - Difficult at the right times (although there are a few unfair moments)- Game took 8 hours to complete (which is good for a good price) and I mostly had fun through the entire gameCons--The default rifle can't do damage for s**t- Some enemies are annoying to fight without the right weapons, killing a super battle droid or the spider tanks without special weapons or grenades is unnessicarily long (yeah yeah difficulty and challenge whatever) - Some sections were a little longer than i would've liked (like the wookie missions) - Bugs- Weird hit detection at times (not that big of a problem just thought i'd mention it, dont try shooting over boxes) - Unfair difficulty spikes - Don't hack or place charges, get a squadmate to do it because your squad will NOT be able to cover you - You can hack or breach doors, but theres really only a few times where hacking it will be helpful. Hacking takes longer and with breaching your squad takes cover and even throws a grenade after breaching, so theres no reason to hack (TL;DR, theres 2 ways to open doors and only one of them is helpful)  Cliffhanger ending  like honestly wtf happened to my edge lord Sev There was more cons than pros but the cons were either minor annoyances or things I felt the game could've gone without. It's a good game and I would reccomend it when it goes on sale. R.I.P good star wars games 7/10			"

												I know I'm a bit late to the party on this one since the game was released almost 11 years ago as of this review, but this game is actually pretty good for what is. The game is fairly challenging, the AI honestly isn't half-bad, and the overall gameplay is pretty damn good; the music is great, the voice acting is solid, and the game actually looks pretty good for its time. My only real gripes are that the game feels a bit short for the campaign (personal opinion, I just felt that it was a bit shorter than what I expected) and that the ending feels like a bit of a cop-out since it leaves the player feeling as if there's going to be a sequel (which we all know is unfortunately never happening). I'd definitely say something about the multiplayer as well if I could, but since the multiplayer has been rendered non-functional due to GameSpy's shutdown, I'm unfortunately not able to do so.In the end, I'd definitely say that this is a game I'd recommend, even without the multiplayer being functional.

												Republic Commando is not a very deep or unique game, but it is challenging and pleasent to play! The multiplayer doesn't work, but the single player is engaging, and may surprise you. Enemies take a long time to kill and there are lots of times where the game feels like a ""bullet hell"" game because of all the enemies coming at you, but it just adds to the challenge. If you like clones, Star Wars, and single player fps games be sure to check out Republic Commando!			"

												Star Wars Republic Commando is such a unique and addicting game that I find it may even rival the Battlefront series.Basically you are the squad leader of a 4 person squad.Delta 40Delta 62 Delta 07And you, Delta 38. Together, you form the Delta Squad. You are clone troopers that have been engineered to be the best of the best. You are the future. You are the commandos. You must strategically command your squad in order to beat back the droid army on various missions across various planets. Something i'd like to mention is that the droids are very tough in this game, while in the movie they seemed like bumbling pieces of metal that could easily be taken down.  Initially I started the game on normal but had to change it to easy because it was too hard. I may re-play the game on medium though. But even on easy, the separatists are a force to be reckoned with and the enemies are remarkably tough. This makes for thrilling gameplay as all the responsibility falls on your shoulders as the squad leader, and you must make hard decisions. In the end, only 2 things matter. Win the battle, and get your squad out alive. But later in the game, you must choose which is more important....Each squad member has a unique personality, and as the game progresses you feel very close to them. The members are: Scorch, (62)Fixer, (40) Sev, (07) And you, 38. Or, Boss.You are alone, cut off, and all you have is your squad. You do whatever it takes to save them. I'll never get tired of hearing:Engage snipe maneuver, Delta.Rearrange some architecture, commando.I want some explosives here, Delta!Stop limping around and get some bacta, soldier.Engage anti armor position, delta!Something i'd like to mention is that your character's full number is actually 1138. 38 is just for short. I think that's cool because THX-1138 was a screenplay George Lucas wrote in college. So that's a neat little Easter egg there.And also, at the end of the game you can hear the x wing pilots from a New Hope saying things they said during the Death  Star run. So that's another cool little Easter egg. I also like how you can attack your squad, and they fight back! I tried killing my squad mates one time, and found myself fighting against them. I actually felt really bad. XDThis game is spectacular, extremely fun, unique, and a must-buy. It was so much fun for me because I am a HUGE fan of the Clone Troopers. I just think they're really cool, and being able to not only be one, but be a commander throughout this game, was an incredible experience.I would definitely, whole heartily recommend this game. The only thing I'm disappointed about is that there isn't more. I thought there'd be several more planets and missions leading up to Order 66. Oh well, maybe there will be a sequel in the future called Imperial Commando. (Just please don't have EA make it) I give this game a 10/10.The game is extremely fun with a great story, good voice actors, great controls, hard bosses that require strategy to take down, good weapons, great graphics, and a great atmosphere. Would play again.			"

												Star Wars Republic Commando is a unique experience for a Star Wars game. You don't play as a Jedi or a Bounty Hunter or any of the things in between. Instead you get plopped directly into the head of a Clone trooper and thrown onto the battlefields of Episode Two.As a clone trooper you don't get much back story or indeed any motivation beyond the occasional communication pop-up on your UI that tells you where to go next. Indeed you were bred for combat and unquestioning loyalty and that's what you do. This rather unique aspect does a lot of alleviate many of the problems that usually plague Star Wars games and makes Republic Commando a rather enjoyable experience.You are not just any Clone Trooper however, you are a squad leader and this is where the gameplay of Republic Commando comes into play. With you have 3 additional commandos, each with their own area of expertise. A sniper, a demolitions expert and a hacker. As you go through the missions you will be able to order your team around, into cover, mounting gun positions, or performing specific tasks suited to their specialty through a context sensitive command system. You basically just point at an object and click and one of your squad members takes the appropriate action. This all works surprisingly well and trying to play the game as a lone wolf tends to end badly as the game features some rather impressive AI, both on the part of your teammates and the enemies.The game is very pretty and in particular the background deserves notice as there is always something else going on there which often looks every bit as intense as the fight you are distracted from.The voice-acting is pretty good for a game but you will quickly realize that the developers took a little shortcut here as the many different voices and accents the clones have makes you wonder just how similar they really are.Star Wars Republic Commando is an attempt to take the Star Wars franchise into the squad based tactical genre and it comes away from the attempt quite nicely although it is a game that has it's flaws, most notably the campaign is extremely short and ends with a cliffhanger that's never resolved as this is the only game in the franchise. Still all in all it's one of the best Star Wars games out there and one of those that can be held up as a good game in it's own right.			"

												As a Star Wars fan, this was fun.  It's a first person shooter, has nothing to do with the elite characters of the movie, instead you are a clone trooper.  The teamwork works great, at least they listen to what you want them to do.  Outside of that, the AI isn't great for either your partners or for the enemies.  There are a variety of enemies, some that are rather tough, and others that just annoy.  The weapons are decent, but nothing spectacularly new.  The storyline is intriguing and connects somewhat well within the Star Wars Universe.  The fun, didn't last through the entire game though as the game gets quite repetitive.  The graphics aren't too interesting to look at these days, and this isn't to say that they aren't good, just that there's no real art design that stands out.  Everything seems bleak and without much detail.If you are not a Star Wars fan, this may not tickle your fancy.  However, it's a short game that can easily be beaten in less than 10 hours.  I enjoyed it.			"

												This game...Is a masterpiece, I want to cry for the fact that the sequel was dropped, this was one of my favorite games as as a kid. If you haven't seen the behind the scenes video, a real special operations veteran was used for the MoCap in this game, which really made the authentic ""Elite clone squad"" Feeling. The game's graphics are just amazing, the squad system is beautifully crafted, AND LIKE HALF LIFE 3, we were left hanging in the end with no sequel in sight.But I digress, this game was one of the games (besides splinter cell, which is my first favorite) that holds a VERY warm special place in my heart. I recently discovered today it was on steam for only $9.99, letm e get straight I am no ""diehard star wars fan"" But it was just one of the games I grew up with, and since my disc barely worked anymore, I was ecstatic to see it was on steam, and from what I hear, you can still play multiplayer through direct IP connection, what's not to like? If you are a fan of star wars, but not a huge fan, this game is for you, because yes, it does have all the star wars aspects, but it's as if those are just masks making the game more beatiful over a core elite squad game.This game is  WORTH THE $9.99, BUY IT!

												Great game, I've loved the story, made me think about the ""Clone side"" of the Clone Wars.The gameplay was awesome, it was not just one FPS but a strategy game too. The action of controlling your squad is the great point of this game.It's a shame that the game is too short, and a next game of the series was never made.			"

												It's not very often a Star Wars game (specifically this one) goes on sale. I remember playing this a few years ago when it first came out, just picked it up on Steam, too. Had loads of fun playing the campaign, lots of great memories from this game. I remember hugging the healing stations because I was worried I'd get killed during the next fight all the time.You can play as different specialized Clone Troopers (i.e. Demolitions, Sniper, etc.).This is actually one of those games where commanding your own squad is fun. The AI is decent (not perfect, but close enough). You can use turrets from fallen Republic Gunships and mow down enemies with it. All in all, a great game.. multiplayer wasn't that bad too. I had lots of fun dueling 1v1. One day, I was lucky enough to pull a direct headshot by bouncing a Wookie crossbow projectile off the wall on somebody. :D: Been a while, and I can't remember the name of the map, but it was an arena map called ""Clone Training"".I give the game a 8.5/10. Although the game was pretty enjoyable, I remember it being short (a few hours only) and there were some brutal levels.. well, that's AI squad-based gameplay for ya. Anyways, you can listen to me yap all day, but this goes on my list of Top 10 SW video games ever released. It's on sale right now for just $3, worth buying if you're a fan of Star Wars.			"

												The second best Star Wars Game of modern times, behind Legendary masterpiece Jedi Outcast.  Ive played it at least five times, and it still kicks major a.s.s.  The authentic feeling of Star Wars is what makes or breaks a game set in this universe, and almost all others fail to capture it.  Republic Commando has that feeling all the way to its bones, from the Clone Squad commands, to the run and gun of military squad combat, this game looks right, sounds right, and feels right.  Ready up Commandos.			"

												""GET YOURSELF SOME BACTA, SOLDIER""The prequels were flawed yes, but at least the Episodes II-III era (2002-2005) spawned some sweet SW games, for many the last great era for LucasArts (everything went downhill after 2005).Republic Commando is ""THE"" SW shooter, by that I mean the best SW shooter of all time (unless Dark Forces gets a remake, which is unlikely next to impossible). The Halo 2-Half 2 influence is evident (minus riding a vehicle and the gravity gun) and the game tries to be lean and mean (not bloody though). Explosions and melee attacks are everywhere, and the cheesy-cute humor of the prequels is nowhere to be found. Overall the game provides a solid Clone Wars experience.The graphics still look very good for a mid-00s game and the sound design is superb.But sadly, the game has some clear flaws, which put the game in a  8-8.5 out of 10 zone at best (it could have been a 10 out of 10)a) too short (like 4-5 hours on easy). Also, some people will find frustrating that there are only three (extended) maps: Geonosis, Republic Ship and Kashyyyk. b) the AI of the squad is not that great, they get killed easily on medium difficulty.c) some enemies are ridiculously overpowered and hard to kill without heavy weapons (which are hard to find)That said, the game was loved-popular enough so fans demanded a sequel, which never came due to the mismanagement of LucasArts that slowly killed the company until its 2012 disappearance.

												This game is so good that i had to buy it again after i lost my original version of the game.Pros:~Amazing action-packed about 8h story~Phenominal voice acting and backround music~Flawless combat~Quite a few weapons including: a concussion rifle, a geonosian beam cannon, a wookie bowcaster and the always reliable DC-17m Interchangeable Weapon System which has three different attachments: Ion pulse blaster, RPG anti-armor, and sniper. If u have all three attachments fully stocked with ammo u will be able to solve any situation.~Some enemies can be a pain sometimes but that gives it that touch that u arent invincible and u need to think before u act~Graphics are pretty good~And there is also a decent multiplayerCons:~Ocational glitches/bugs for example a team mate goes down but cant be revived~The AI can sometimes be a little dumb but nothing too major~For me atleast the story was a bit too shortConclusion:I would give this game 9/10. Its pretty much a must-buy for any Star Wars fan.			"

												One of the best star wars games I have ever played. It  was rather challenging at certain times and you had to really work as a leader to control your squad if you wanted to win. It did a wonderful job of getting the star wars feeling right in level design and  art. The only problem I had with it was it started to feel slow after i had played it off and on for 2 weeks. But it is an older game and free roam wassnt as standard as most shoooter games today. Also i have to remark the bonus making of the game videos are Well worth the watch for any fan and are availible in game for free.			"

												This is literally a better Halo 5 from the story, to the AI and actual presence of squad commands, to the balance, and even the gameplay.Some people say the game is short and that's primarily because it's split up into 3 distinct campaigns which maybe about 2 hours a piece. Not bad especially considering the price. But where this game shines so well is the squad command. It may only consist of 4 basic commands, target a specific enemy, and attach to cover (grenade, anti-armor, or sniper position) but the way it implements it is so beautiful.You, as the leader of Delta Squad, have to constantly balance between defense and offense in a wide variety of scenarios and above all else it makes it feel like the combat is alive more than anything else. At any moment you have to react to something and figure out how to tell your squad to deal with it. And the great thing is: They are NOT dumb AI, they may be among the best AI I've seen so far and this game was made in 2005. Which if you fail you can't blame it on the AI, they did they're job meaning you failed yours. The responsibility to win any engagement falls squarely on you because your squad will perform and often perform very well. And somehow that makes it a game of personal skill in a squad command game and it's bloody fantastic. I love this game to pieces for that.And beyond that like I said earlier the story is great, it really does makes you feel like you're an elite Clone squad during the Clone Wars. The immersion is absolutley perfect and the squad mates accompying you all have distinct personalities are quite interesting. They even often say things during combat that range from helpful to entertaining.If anything this game left me wanting for so much more because what I got was amazing. Which is why I'm giving it my first non-humor 10/10. I will ALWAYS love this game, it is easily worth more than the price you're charged for it.			"

												I liked that it involves mostly clones, as they were my favorite characters in the Star Wars saga, and the fact that this game is based on clone commandos has made it one of my most favorite games in Star Wars. I liked the Campaign as well as multiplayer while it lasted. What I dislike is the fact that GameSpy is dead, which means multiplayer is as well. It had been one of my favorite games mostly because of the multiplayer, and now my excitement in this game has decreased because of that very reason. While there are websites that offer to fix this problem, such as moddb.com, it's still not as fun as it was anymore. If there is anyone who is a fellow commando fan reading this right now, hope is not lost. There is a website that is dedicated to Republic Commando content that is attempting to reach enough followers to demand a sequel to a game that was once in it's prime. I will not reveal the name of this group, as I am taking precautions not to attract any attention of hackers or trollers because I do not want anything drastic to happen to this group that is attempting to keep the Commando name alive. Good luck commandos, and I'll see you on the battlefield.			"

A game ahead of its time Star Wars Rebublic Commando is set in the early stages of the Clone Wars. You are a clone commander in charge of Delta Squad, the republics deadliest soldiers. You and your squad are sent behind enemy lines and must fight the droids of CIS (confederacy of independent systems) However, the droids are not the only threat you must face.A very clever and simple squad based gameplayWhen I first dove into the game, I was expecting a squad based system which would be confusing, similar to Red Orchestra 2. The system was actually pretty simple. It did not take long to learn the mechanics. You have just a few buttons which you can use to give your squad commands. Commands such as defend this area, follow me, advance (search and destroy), cancel orders. You can also order your men to different highlighted positions like, sniper,anti armor, turrets and grenade. Might sound confusing, but it really isn't. I was surprised of the good physics in this game and the gameplay itself was fun, but only for a couple of hours. The maps and basic gameplay got a bit repetitive and I got bored after a half an hour or so each session. Still, it was fun and entertaining.Short and loose storythe story was not as good as I hoped. You get a short prolouge cutscene that tells you about the clone commandos. The story jumps from one place to the next. At first you are at Geonosis and suddenly you are investigating a lost republic war ship. So it is not a direct storyline throughout the game. What I did like was the chatter between your men. It was funny at many occasions and you got more feelings about your men. It also ends with a cliffhanger and since republic commando 2 was cancelled I doubt that there will be a sequel anytime soon. Though, the developers leaked information about how the story would continue, so the ending is still there.Worth it?It was a game ahead of its time, so I can't complain about anything really, except the story. Other than the story being very loose I would still recommend bying it, especially if you are a Star Wars fan. The music is top notch. Note: Multiplayer does not work anymore, so you will only be able to play singleplayer, still worth it though "

												It's probably one of the best Star Wars game you could get, it's cheap, fun, has a great soundtrack & nice level design, my favourite being aboard the republic ship. The levels are short but theirs plenty of them so you will get at least 8-10 hours of gameplay worth going through the campaign. I did have a few problems with the DPI it was way to fast & I had to set it down to 1 just to look around & aim correctly. I wasn't able to play at 1080p even tried going into the files to change it but it was pretty buggy.			"

As an FPS it takes inspiration from all the right sources, including Metroid Prime for its famous HUD.Pros* Tacticool as ♥♥♥♥. Door breaching, landmine ambush, air support, everything is there* Good ability at creating a believable atmosphere with a mix of large battles and claustrophobic resistance* Excellent OST, with some very bad asses Mandalorian songsCons* Low variety of weapons and enemies* You're never given quite enough ammunition to kill armored droidsNote that the ending is a slightly-frustrating cliffhanger that will likely never be resolved.

												Equal parts tactical strategy game and first-person shooter, Republic Commando proves itself greater than the sum of its parts.  Enemy encounters are varied and fun, in a way that only sci-fi shooters can be with their assortment of alien and robotic adversaries.  Squad commands are doled out in a system that is about as intuitive as possible, at least until voice recognition works its way into the realm of gaming.  On top of it all, great writing that de-emphasizes the Jedi Order does something that George Lucas failed to do; it makes the prequels cool.  Republic Commando is the rare Star Wars game that is more than just a money grab, and you know it because it would be just as good without all of the licensing.

Multiplayer Shall Live On! How to play Multiplayer 
A Guide for STAR WARS™ Republic Commando
By: (Eyeris)Toxicvirus1230

			Got Republic Commando? Want to play online with friends/others? Think its impossible to play multiplayer after GameSpy died? Think again! This guide shows how to play Multiplayer with others/friends!		


This game is pretty amazing. First of all, for a game that came out in 2005, the graphics are really well-done. The textures and graphic layouts really showed how much time LucasArts put into this game. The story is awesome too, especially for those who are interested in Star Wars lore. No spoilers on the story; I will let you experience it in full :). Lets not forget the Multiplayer, which is probably the best experience I had with this game. Once you finish the amazing story this game has, you will definitely have fun battling it out in the Multiplayer mode, especially if you love Arena FPS games like Unreal Tournament and Quake Live.I will recommend this game to anyone who loves Star Wars, or just loves online Arena FPS games.

												I love this game. Like this game has single-handedly made me look back into Star Wars games in general. Republic Commando is basically what happens when you make a Tom Clancy game, put it in the Star Wars universe, and make your AI allies actually listen to you. I know, I could hardly understand it myself at first.Your squad actually listens to you instead of going into random rooms (a la Mass Effect) or not doing anything (some Tom Clancy games). But even without the great ally AI, the game still holds up well. The gameplay is surprisingly furious for a mid 2000s shooter, and you'll nearly die many times in the crazy firefights that ensue during the game. The game's multiplayer is also fun (somewhat similar to Halo 1/2's splitscreen multiplayer) but not as lasting as the campaign. The game's story length (~8.5 hours) is also respectable given the depth and action. Did I mention that your allies actually friggin do what you tell them to do, even in a firefight?Honestly the only downside to this game is its lack of sequel. The game ends on an obvious cliffhanger that was meant to segue into a sequel, as one was in development before this even released. Unfortunately the project got cancelled, so the ending just gets left with nothing to follow up on, which is a shame. I wish this game was given as much love as The Force  Unleashed; it'd be more deserving to be sure.			"

												I'll make this review short and sweet ( maybe ).STAR WARS™ Republic Commando™ is as it shows an FPS game featuring the Republic Commandos' dangerous missions throughout their first year(s) in combat. The gameplay is pretty good and for all you gamers out there with ridiculously sucky laptops or computers that have horrible fps in modern games, this game will run beautifully in your system. Your teammates are quite smart even though they are just AI's, they warn you about everything and anything throughout the game. Star Wars fan or not this game is truly a must have if you're interested in First Person Shooting games with a well made story. If you're thinking of buying this then do it, you absolutely wont regret it and if you do, well sucks to be you.			"

												I liked this game, and keep wondering why there isn't a sequel out given *spoilers* *spoilers* *more spoilers*. I'm hardly a fan of the Star Wars prequels, but the characters and plot are interesting and solid. I especially love the first half of chapter 2, with its ""haunted house"" feel. I can even get over the fact that Scorch is voiced by Raphael Sbarge (that guy who will forever be Carth Onasi to me and who only has one acting style), given that all the squad's personalities are both clearly defined and show development across the plot-arc. For instance, I love how Fixer is incredibly straitlaced but sometimes the facade cracks, just a little.I also don't play a whole lot of shooters, but I really enjoyed the feeling of being in charge of a squad that reacts to me without a whole lot of complicated keyboard commands to memorize. In fact, there's only one button to direct every terrain-contextualized action, and that's okay with me! A little odd that the boys will get infinite ammo of whatever type they're using while they're in a terrain position, but hey, Scorch lobbing unlimited grenades is also okay with me. The graphics are also fine for how old it is, and I like the little details like the visor windshield wiper for rain/blood/oil/scratches(!?). It was a little frustrating at times when running low on ammo or health and with no way to get more before having to survive difficult waves of enemies, but that's almost certainly because I'm not very good at shooters. :POverall, I really got the feeling that I was part of a team while playing this game, and it was really awesome.

												Here's my bottom line opinion on Republic Commando; it's the second-best Star Wars first-person shooter. Just below Dark Forces. It has the unfortunate distinction of being the best game to come out of the prequel trilogy, and doesn't escape the taint of the prequel's legacy. I may even like the ideas behind Republic Commando more than I like the game itself.Here is what sucks about Republic Commando: the weapons sound weak, and there aren't many different enemies to fight. So what does Republic Commando do right? The intro to the game is great. It details where you and your squad came from, all from the first person perspective. In fact, this game takes a page from Half-Life in that the entire game is played from the first-person perspective. There are a couple of scenes where you are not in control of your character, but they're limited.The squad AI is not smart but it's competent. They'll kill enemies, heal themselves, heal you when you drop, take cover, etc. There are certain set pieces that you can order a squadmate to take position at for a specific purpose (like sniping or anti-armor) and they're meant to be used. Your squad dies less when they're in one of these ordered positions. The squad also has fantastic vocal banter. Each member is a personality, and I got attached to them as the game went along.Though the levels are a little cookie cutter, there are plenty of objectives to them and no lack for fights. I was fighting in corridors, in small courtyards and hangers, on multi-level starship bridges, and in trees. They're not as varied as Dark Forces, but each environment is well made.And now I can get to what stops this from being a great game. They can fix the sound effects and toss in a couple more enemies, but it's harder to change the setting. Republic Commando takes place at the onset of the Clone Wars. It starts on Geonosha even. And though it takes place over a two (three?) year span, it could have gone farther. This was a pre-Episode 3 game and it shows. It feels like a teaser leading up to Episode 3 and, ultimately, suffers for that. It doesn't deserve to be timely movie release fodder. It deserves to be treated like a game that can stand on its own two legs. Something that can be taken out of the context of the prequel release. It doesn't deserve to be lumped in with Episode 1 Racer, Star Wars Starfighter, Bounty Hunter, Obi-Wan, or any other godawful prequel game.It doesn't carry the same tone as those games. The developers did their damnedest to give this game a fair chance. They go out of their way to make  you know that you are playing an elite soldier. You're no jedi, and you're not fodder either. You see your share of ally deaths and the Clone War takes its toll. But you're fighting bugs on Geonosha. And battle droids, even if they're way more menacing than they ever were in the prequel movies. They may bleed oil, wear a metallic gray paint job (rather than the orange seen in the movies), and the super battle droids may be some tough ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, but they're still battle droids, which are inherently lame. There's a pitiful tie in with General Grieveous in the form of his bodyguards, which flip and hop around like acrobats, with electric sticks. They're not threatening in the slightest, more annoying than anything, and serve only to give General Grieveous an excuse to make an unwarranted appearance.What I'm getting down to is that in Republic Commando you are playing, in essence, a proto super stormtrooper. I wish the devs would've been allowed to run with that rather than get tied to the time frame that stuck them between the two prequel movies. I hope we can get another Republic Commando game, but I'm not expecting it. This franchise has legs that get cut out from beneath it by the movies it was made to support.			"

												If you've played it before and have $10 to spare or if it's on sale, absolutely get it. The community for it mostly gone but if you REALLY want to get some multiplayer action going, there are small groups like ReiGn that will play and have servers up. I may or may not get one myself. There are plenty of mods for the game as well. I haven't put that much time looking into it but I believe there is one that adds an entire new campaign. Never played it before? This game is within that top tier of all Star Wars games ever made. Amazing and unique gameplay + story. The chat between your squad as you progress makes it even better. It can be incredibly challenging even now if you turn the diff. all the way up. The squad mechanic also ups the difficiutly a bit as you will need to utilize them correctly if you want to get anywhere.  You are not a God (i.e a Jedi) in this game and it will remind you if you try to lone wolf it.Like I said the game still looks AMAZING considering how old it is. One thing that makes this stand out in my eyes is that like the story for BF2, this is one is told from the Clone perspetive rather than the overdone Jedi one. All in all yes get this game. Maybe with all the hype coming back to Star Wars with the new movie and BF3 we'll finally get a sequel.			"

												This has to be one of my favorite games of all time. Not because it is Star Wars or anything like that. Partly cause it is Star Wars actually. But it has a certain feel to it that other games don't give me. Especially FPS wise. FPS wise I mainly stick with Halo cause I really enjoy Sci-Fi. For awhile Halo was my go to FPS. But this game takes that position now. Yes, I could be fighting the flood and watching them devour people. But for some reason that never made me as nervous as when I was roaming the abandoned Republic ship as Clones got torn limb from limb in the room next to me. Yes, I could be trying to take down a hunters. But a lot of villains in this game provide much more of a challenge.Another aspect of the game is the squad. You control your squad and tell them where to go. I'm constantly checking my squad's health and changing their positions. Yes, some current games have squads. You kinda control them, but I don't think as much as in this game. But that's just my opinion.With a compelling story and constant threats trying to kill you, this game makes for a great experience.			"

												This is probably one of the best FPS that are out on the market today. I have been playing this game for 7+ years and have enjoyed every second of it. Before the server shutdown, this was an amazing multiplayer game. There was constantly 50+ people playing per day on every server, and everyone enjoying themselves.As for the campaign, they really put in a lot of detail into this. They were able to establish a squadron of elite troopers known as ""Delta Squad"" and tell us about their story and what they were able to accomplish. Like any good game with a story, there is also a lot of sad parts, and enjoyable parts. The creators of this game also were able to establish a few easter-eggs for us as the players to figure out, and made the graphics far ahead of its time.All in all, I love this game and always will. If the servers weren't shut down, I would definitley recommend this game for anyone. But if you enjoy Star Wars, and Campaigns, then this is the game for you. One of the best on the market.			"

												Didn't expect much since it was a game that came out a decade ago.  But, surprisingly, this game hold up well on PC.  Although I can't get the bumpmapping option to work (using AMD/ATi card, seems to be for Nvidia cards), the graphics looks good (think almost at the level of Rainbow Six: Vegas on PC or Mass Effect ground mission).I feel that the weapon feel underpowered and I had difficulty at first.  But slowly I learn to rely on the squad members more, commanding them take sniping/grenade position, it became less overwheming.  I am only over one-fifth of the game and I like what I have played so far.  You don't need to be Star Wars fan to enjoy (I am not).			"

												Hands down the best Star Wars video game ever made. I've played through it on 3 different systems, multiple times now. If you have any love for the Clone Wars, or even Star Wars as a whole... Or Heck, even if you just love Sci-Fi shooters, you owe it to yourself to try this one.It still looks great today, with anistrophic filtering and texturework nigh on the best of its time. The Steam version goes on sale often and only takes a small mouse acceleration fix for the menus, otherwise it runs like a dream.It is a Squad-Based shooter, done very well. How many of those do you even know of that exist? Besides maybe Rainbow 6. You can and are given incentive to order your men to specific positions, breach maneuvers, or turret mounts, etc... They aren't dumb either, great AI too. They'll prioritize targets as you mark them.Not to mention everyone on the team can do every job, from splicing terminals to planting bombs to setting up sniping nests. You can do all of it too, but if you use the right guy for it, they'll usually do it better.And the story, oh the story... There are 3 zones you'll be going through, going from Geonosis, to something else, to Kashyyyk. I don't want to spoil the 2nd one because, well, it's frankly fantastic atmosphere and all that. Just trust me, Geonosis and Kashyyyk might be average, but the 2nd one, oh man it's great.I... I could keep going, but again just trust me, this game is a Home Run in every way I can think of. Buy it, play it, love it like everyone else who has bought it and played it.			"

												Zero Dark Thirty - Star Wars Edition. These boys would fit right in with modern day Navy SEALs or US Army Rangers, heck they even have a little SWAT in them. Call of Duty ain't got nothing on this gem. Their personalities are unique and easy going, if you can get used to TMNT then you can handle Delta Squad. The military tactics are down to Earth and easily recongnizable, plus each has a distinct voice unlike the Clone Wars Series were everyone has the same one, gives each one personality only your main character has Jango's voice. So if you are looking for realistic gritty Star Wars without any of those pesky Jedi or Sith, this one is for you. Its nice you can for once block out the Sith or the Jedi and pretend just for a moment Star Wars is actually a WAR and not a philosophical battle between a guy with a red sword and someone else with a (insert color here) sword. Very refreshing. It makes the Star Wars Universe seem not so far away after all and all the more enjoyable.			"

												This game is worth every cent that I payed and possibly even more if the story was longer! (already a fairly long and fun story, don't worry). I played this game non-stop on the hardest difficulty as soon as I got it and it is honestly perfect in every way. This game, not even kidding in any way, has thebest beginning to any game I've played. The awe that I felt as I saw my character's life begin was simply wonderful and irreplacable, it might just be me but everything about this was just beautiful and unforgettable. Enough of that though (I love this game so f**king much) it's time to go on to your squad. The squad gameplay is amazing and unlike most squad features in most triple A title games nowadays. The basics of what I'm saying are that there's good control over your squad and that without you your squad will likely die and if you're alone you will likey die, only together can you effectively triumph against you enemies both weak and strong. The story itself is fun and effectively gave me a feeling of bonding and love with my team, all of them of distinct personalities and traits that make them unique and lovable, they will even occasionally crack a joke between one another or yell something that makes me laugh or smile. To be completely honest, with how amazing this game is I am very suprised that it isn't as loved or known as star wars battlefront is. I'd much prefer this game over that (despite battlefront being my chidhood and being simply a great game). I really hope that someone eventually comes to finish the series with its canceled sequel otherwise I shall continue to cry at the thought of what could've been.as a final verdict I rate this work of art a 10/10, it has no real failings other than age and at this point I honestly want to play it all over again. (I don't usually give games this good of ratings, only other game to get that high on my list is portal 2). I cannot reccomend this game more if you like squad gameplay and fps games or if you like murderous-deep voiced badasses, funny-somewhat timid, or that one guy who follows orders and is fairly serious about most subjects because that's what this squad consists of and I love tham all.

												Pros:-Great story (I haven't finished it but what I have done so far has been really enjoyable)-Really neat tactical gameplay (The squad commands mechanic feels really satisfying)-The above, in addition to the great audio makes for a very immersive experience in the world of star warsCons:-None worth mentioningThis game is really good for its time. I didn't play it until a year ago, and I still really enjoy it despite the slightly dated graphics and  the linear gameplay(which in this case is not at all a bad thing).			"

												I highly recommend this game. It is very VERY hard at some points, but its very fun and has a great story. You take lead of your squad and encounter many enemies. Breach doors, give your squad positions, target enemies, and many more commands. Though I was disappointed at the end, actually I was kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. After losing one of your squad mates  and the droids invade, you get ready for the next mission, then suddenly the credits appear. I think this would be a great game for a sequel,  maybe even the main character being your lost squad member, fighting back and finding the delta squad! I'd give this game 8/10 We really need a sequel for this gameOh and sorry for all the spoiler boxes didn't want to give anything away			"

												One of the best action FPS ever made. It's kinda like a Halo clone but to say it's a ripoff of halo would be unfair. It plays kinda like a first person Ghost Recon or Rainbow Six Vegas but with less strategy. The whole game is just really well made and you can tell the developers put their heart & soul in this. The characters in the game feel so lively and it feels like YOU ARE the commando the entire time. Using the DC-17m with the blaster rifle attachment never gets old and the sounds in the game sound very satisfying from blaster shots to droid noises. It is a rich FPS experience with a cheap price tag. Well worth your money. Easily one of the best star wars game.			"

												I just finished the game and I just have to say that it's pretty damn good. Especially for its current price.Now, the combat is Bioshock style. Meaning that you just shoot and at some moment the enemy just falls down and is dead. There's no real feedback to the damage you're doing and due to that the gunplay is very unsatisfying. The melee however was strong and it made me take a lot of risks to just take out the enemy. If a game gets me to risk myself and forces me to not play safe without it feeling unfair and just artificial, then I'd say that it does a good job.The story is what it is. It's 3 main campaigns, each is about 2-3 hours. On normal, the game was just as difficult as it should be. I lost the game a few times, but not enough to have the game feel unfair. Almost every death felt like it was my fault and preventable.The graphics look pretty good and the game runs very well as well, even on my 4GB DDR3, FX-4100, GT640.The game's been in many bundles, so it's pretty cheap when it comes to value. You'll be able to trade for it no problem.One problem though was that it ends in an annoying cliffhanger and the last mission also ends very abruptly, which makes me feel that they were just pushing it out as quickly as possible. The A.I. is pretty good for your team, but the same can't be said about your allies and enemies. They usually just sit and do nothing and get themselves killed. I know that all allies are meant to die, but it's just so damn annoying that they die to one minion or something.Overall, is this game worth the full price? If you're not on a shoe-string budget, then yeah. Is it worth a bundle purchase or a trade? Yeah, definitely. Overall 7/10(All games start at a 5/10 and move up/down based on its pros/cons)			"

												This is one of the most criminally-underrated shooters ever made. The game manages to fully immerse the player in the Star Wars universe without using Jedi, force powers, or any other hallmarks typical of the Star Wars franchise. This is a tactical first-person shooter played from the perspective of a Clone Trooper, one of the expendable ""mooks"" who drop like flies in the movies and are predecessors to the Stormtroopers, the ultimate ""disposable bad guy."" Each member of the squad is a clone, but they behave with distinctive personalities and voices that make you actually care about them. The game has a fairly good difficulty curve, with the game gradually spacing bacta tanks and ammo dumps farther and farther apart as the game progresses without becoming noticeable. You will need to use teamwork to knock out larger enemies like spider droids, which are almost impossible to down with the limited grenade launcher ammo you have. To drive the importance of team work home, the game has several sections where the squad splits, meaning you have no one to revive you if you die. And you have at most 6 hits on normal difficulty before you're a goner. The presentation is fantastic. The graphics have aged well and it runs smoothly on modern operating systems with no compatibility issues. The soundtrack is a masterpiece, with memorable pieces like the Mandalorian chant ""Vode An"" punctuating intense action sequences, as well as familiar snippets from the film scores. The game will throw in bits of fan-service such as a squad mate quipping ""these must be the droids we're looking for"" which just make you chuckle even under pressure. The AI is decent but will occasionally get stuck behind barriers when rushing to revive you, leading to frustration. The cooperative nature of the campaign makes the lack of online co-op campaign play very glaring. If this game ever gets a sequel, this feature needs to be added first. The campaign only features three planets, and is pretty short. None of the multiplayer maps are very interesting. These are probably due to the game's status as a tie-in for Episode III's film release with crunched development time. Just get this game. You will not be disappointed. It's not perfect by any means but its extremely minor flaws do little to hamper an amazing experience. For a 9-year-old game it's extremely playable and not dated at all.			"

												Republic Commando is a nice squad based first person shooter. Playing as a clone delta squad commander provides a fresh perspective in the Star Wars universe where you get to use a blaster instead of a light saber. The squad based system is simple and easy to use and the AI actually follows orders well. The small assortment of weapons and attachments isn't impressive, but they get the job done. The game offers an engaging tactical story and traditional Star Wars music. There's no in-game options for wide screen resolution support, but you can manually modify some .ini files to get higher resolutions working. And the graphics look decent at 1920x1080.Although there's nothing great about it, Republic Commando is definitely a polished game that is fun from start to finish--worthy of its 2005 release date.

Short version: 87%Star Wars meets Rainbow Six in this tactical FPS, where you lead a group of strangely unique clones against the enemies of the Republic in three different campaigns. It may not be on the levels of Battlefront or the actual Rainbow Six titles, but Republic Commando is still a great game to play.Long version:Star Wars has a really successful and long relationship with the FPS genre, and Republic Commando is no exception. It may be nothing but a Rainbow Six clone in Star Wars costume, but this is hidden behind excellent game design.The story takes place during the Clone Wars, where the player takes the role of a special commando, leading his own squad straight into the heart of enemy lines. (The game is not tied to the animated series.)The settings are a bit clichéd: the battle of Geonosis, a (seemingly) desolate space ship, and Kashyyyk (because there always have to be wookies)… Luckily the writers knew these predictable settings need something to keep interest, so they spoil us with some good dialogues and fast-paced mission structure.The gameplay itself is simplistic squadron-based tactical combat where a single button replaces the command menu. It may be a significant limitation, but the system works as intended. All events are scripted, but you still need to continuously assess the situation and order your squad accordingly.Republic Commando may not reach early Halo levels with the AI, but it has nothing to be ashamed of. Just don’t expect your squad to win the game for you; team management is a very crucial point, especially in hold the line situations.The game didn’t age well from a technical standpoint; modern systems may have a bit of a problem running it properly. But when they do, you are offered one of the best Star Wars games to date to play with.			"

												This game came out in 2005 and has a much better squad system then halo: reach which came out in 2010. You play as Delta 38 aka Boss, leader of an elite clone commando squad. You lead your squad of 4 commandos across 3 different campaigns during the era of the clone wars. Each campaign is relatively short (around 2 hours) but feel unique enough to give you a different experience through each one. Atmosphere is great and so is the soundtrack. Using your squad effectively is very important to succeed in this game. You can't finish this game by yourself you need to use your AI controled squad. Your squad consists of 3 other commandos that all have different strengths and personalities, which leads to some good interactions and interesting dialogue. The squad commanding is very simple but also one of the most effective ways i've ever seen in any game, even in 2016. the game ends on a cliffhanger ending, originally planned to continue the story in a sequel. unfortunatly this game got scrapped so the game ends with a very important part of the story unexplained. Rating 8.5/10.			"

												I recommend this for a die hard Star Wars fan. If you're not a fan, then this is a generic shooter that falls down on some areas. Main problem is that the variety of enemies and guns are small, which makes the shooting part pretty boring. The leading of the team is made surprisingly well and the team is most of the time useful. For some reason, the team can only use grenades, sniper rifle and anti-tank weapons on certain specific points, which doesn't offer much of tactical challenge. Most of the time, you order your men to all available positions and run yourself to melee distance where enemy is very lacking. The game hasn't stood the test of time, and lacks memorable moments. Then again the music and sounds are pretty good that makes the atmoshphere quite good. Level design is boring, unmemorable and  and areas between loading times are really short(usually 5-10 minutes). The game doesn't change much after the first few levels. The game lasts for about 5 hours, which is good or bad depending if you like it or not.			"

												Like a swift kick to the stomach, this game will leave you doubled-over and gasping for breath hours after you finish playing. How many times have I been forced to kill a spider droid on my own with just a pistol because I ran out of ammo and my entire squad is incapacitated, or how often have I encountered a droid dispenser pumping out SBD's only to realize I've already used up all my anti-armor charges? These kinds of situations force to think ahead and plan & execute your strategies quickly. Keeping your squad organized is key. It's a beatiful thing when you give your squadmates commands and then find out that what you've decided for them to do is the perfect strategy. Good ol' Delta 38... he always knows just what to do.Squad control in the game is easy as pie, and the friendly AI is okay, though at times a bit frustrating. When they're given a command, the squad will go do it no matter what, even if it means doing something dumb like getting killed because they don't think to kill the things in their way first. Enemies are pretty stupid, but you don't need to be smart when you're a Super Battle Droid. The graphics and landscapes are dated but still amazing, from the windy, dusty canyons of Geonosis to the dark and foreboding forests of Kashyyyk. Except for the commando armor, everything is dark and gloomy. Gameplay is also awesome; everything is fast-paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat (and sometimes out of it completely). Whether you're desperately trying to hold off an endless stream of enemies as one of your squadmates plants explosives on a droid dispenser while another hacks into a security system while under fire, or you're clearing a path through a group of fat Trandoshan slavers in the maze-like corridors of an assault ship, there's never a dull moment in Republic Commando, and the hard difficulty mode is just right.The Squad:Delta 38, the main character. A tough-as-nails commando, 38 don't take no crap from nobody. Even when under heavy fire, he calmly gives commands like he's ordering food at a McDonald's drive-thru. He's the voice of reason, keeping everybody under control.Delta 62 (Scorch), the Demolitions expert. Scorch likes explosives. That's all there is to say.Delta 07 (Sev), is a fierce hunter. His best use is as a sniper, providing amazingly accurate covering fire for his squadmates. His only job is to kill, kill, kill.Delta 40 (Fixer), is just a good old-fashioned soldier. He's uncomplicated and a great fighter, and always follows orders. Other than that, I'm not quite sure what his deal is... I guess he's the ""computer expert,"" though any commando can slice any console.Each commando has his own personality. Scorch can be quite humorous at times, and Sev has some pretty disturbing things to say. One thing I don't understand is why do all have different voices? I though they were all the same clones...Trust me when I saw that even still to this day this game is worth every penny. The only thing I wish is that more games could be like this.			"

												Back in 2005, Star Wars: Republic Commando was an unsung gaming classic, since then it has aged incredibly well in the gameplay department, standing defiant against both the tides of time and the trends of cover-based shooting and regenerating health. The gameplay, weapons, squad mechanics and even the graphics are still appealing even after all this time. The Steam release of Republic Commando is the third time I have bought this game, and I still love to play it now and again.The first thing that LucasArts got right with this game is making the Commados feel just as bad♥♥♥♥♥as the Jedi, while at the same time making them feel like soldiers. This is accomplished simply with the squad commands and context-dependant actions such as sniping and grenade positions. The scripted animations are icing on the cake like tackling droidekas or killing a kamikazi trandoshan with his own knives.But while each member of Delta Squad is comprehensively a one-man killing machine, they are not as invincible as a Jedi Knight, you need your squad, and again this really enhances the military feel of the game. Performing door breaches, setting up entrenched positions, and setting up covering fire while you outflank the enemy do a great deal to give Republic Commando a military feel that few modern military shooters can match. Putting you in command of Delta Squad was an awesome idea.Atmosphere is another area where this game shines. You start out being dropped behing enemy lines onto Geonosis, fighting your way into a Geonosian hive complex, down through a droid foundry and into a trade federation droid control ship. Then comes the genuinely creepy ghost-ship mission where you will be reduced to being hunted, alone by scavenger droids, and finally you will form part of the first wave in the republic's campaign on Kashyyyk, each location feels unique, and the game manages to capture the frenetic pace of a battlefield, the isolation and helplessness of a horror game, and the epic scale of a megaflora jungle.While some games start to feel dated and klunky as technology and design practices roll on, Republic Commando was at least 10 years ahead of its time. Everything about it shines, and the few flaws are minor and easily overlooked. Even when it's not on sale, this game is a bargain at ten bucks, the only negative point I can hold against Republic Commando is that it wasn't long enough and never had a sequel.			"

												While it's playtime may be on the short side. Republic Commando provides solid, challenging, and engaging combat and on-you-feet tactics that will please any FPS fan. Combined with wonderful atmosphere, a suprisingly fitting orchestrial score and incredible replay value, Republic Commando carves out its own niche in the tide of star wars games. You won't regret playing this in the slightest.			"

												This is one of the best Star Wars single player FPS ever created in my opinion. Its another one of those childhood games that I grew up playing. I bought it again recently to relive the brilliance of this game. The gameplay is solid, the combat is fun(if sometimes difficult) and will genuinely keep you playing and completing the game in a single sitting! Fantastic game			"

												This is an amazing game, and probably my favourite FPS.It's also very short. There are three mini campaigns, which you play through sequentially. One on Geonosis, one onboard a Republic cruiser and one on Kashyyyk, all of them clock in at around 2 hours each.With that big, primary concern out of the way, do I recommend this game? I sure do.Beyond nailing the aesthetic of the Clone Wars (more the one from the films than the tv series) or even Star Wars in general it is a solid single player squad based shooter.Single player and squad based might sound like opposing descriptors, but they're not. The three titular Commandos are your greatest weapon, both in effectiveness and enjoyment. Every Commando can do what you do, at the same rate.Do you want to dash in behind the enemy battle droids and take out their dispenser or do you want to send one of your squad mates to do it so you can lay down covering fire? You'll have them hack their way into power generators to reactivate them, but could just as well do that yourself.Should they fall you can revive them by running up to them with a defibrillator, or order one of the remaining squad mates to do that. Even if you get shot down yourself your squad mates will, at your orders, run over and put you back on your feet.Opposing you are the expected Trade Federation droids, the Geonosian bug army and, the only group not plucked directly from the prequel trilogy, Trandoshan mercenaries. These all have their share of easy fodder (the basic federation droids especially are little more than target practice) as well as a variety of overwhelmingly strong enemies.If the game did not work as well as it does then the best strategy would be to have your squad hold its ground out of harm's way, go at it alone and have them come revive you if it doesn't work out, and it's a testament to the excellent work the developers put into making the squad mechanics worthwhile.Orders are given easily, point at a piece of cover and press the Order button to have a squad mate take cover behind it. Same goes with entering turrets, breaching doors, setting explosives, etc. etc..It's a simple system, but it works well and is easy enough to do in the middle of hectic combat situations, of which there are plenty.The plot doesn't really add anything to existing lore, but it does its job and all of your squad mates have their own distinctive personalities, voices and preferences (though the explosives expert is no faster at placing a charge than his brothers).As long as you keep in mind that this is a short game and that it will primarily stay away from the plot of the films then you're in for a great time, and I recommend this title.

Short version: 87%Star Wars meets Rainbow Six in this tactical FPS, where you lead a group of strangely unique clones against the enemies of the Republic in three different campaigns. It may not be on the levels of Battlefront or the actual Rainbow Six titles, but Republic Commando is still a great game to play.Long version:Star Wars has a really successful and long relationship with the FPS genre, and Republic Commando is no exception. It may be nothing but a Rainbow Six clone in Star Wars costume, but this is hidden behind excellent game design.The story takes place during the Clone Wars, where the player takes the role of a special commando, leading his own squad straight into the heart of enemy lines. (The game is not tied to the animated series.)The settings are a bit clichéd: the battle of Geonosis, a (seemingly) desolate space ship, and Kashyyyk (because there always have to be wookies)… Luckily the writers knew these predictable settings need something to keep interest, so they spoil us with some good dialogues and fast-paced mission structure.The gameplay itself is simplistic squadron-based tactical combat where a single button replaces the command menu. It may be a significant limitation, but the system works as intended. All events are scripted, but you still need to continuously assess the situation and order your squad accordingly.Republic Commando may not reach early Halo levels with the AI, but it has nothing to be ashamed of. Just don’t expect your squad to win the game for you; team management is a very crucial point, especially in hold the line situations.The game didn’t age well from a technical standpoint; modern systems may have a bit of a problem running it properly. But when they do, you are offered one of the best Star Wars games to date to play with.			"

												I can't reccomend this game enough. As a kid, I loved the fact it was a gritty Star Wars game. it really showed a side to the galaxy that had not really been shown. The game has a tactical/strategic aspect of managing your three comrades and their positions, while trying to be an effective member of the team yourself. I started playing this again recently, and I still love it. Obviously the graphics are not great by todays standards, but the game play is still really fun. I still tilt my head away when my team breeches a door, and I still pray every once and awhile that a new version will be made.			"

												Despite me not having many hours on here. I put countless hours on this years ago back on my original Xbox. This game (in my opinion) still holds up with modern day games. Unfortunately, there are few and far between squad-based games out there like this. The only ones that still carry on this tradition would be Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon for example (Singleplayer at least). Which we need more games like this, instead of these one man superpowered (yet normal) soldiers that can regenerate wounds after getting shot multiple times, and with unintelligent A.I. (that seem like that they're just for show, like a hindrance, rather than helping the player take care of hostiles) that stays back 10 feet behind while the player is on the other side of the map, blasting their way through enemy territory. We need less games like that, and more of this, if the FPS Genre wants to at least survive in someway. Definitely worth buying, that is, if you like to work as a team. If you can't handle that responsibility, then look somewhere else.Oh and this game actually has a challenge to it. Pretty rare nowadays in the FPS Genre.9.7/10 Would buy and play again.			"

												 Star Wars: Republic Commando was a great experience for the most part, but it got fairly repetitive after a while. I got VERY tired of how many times I've had to breach a door or kill Droidekas and Super Battle Droids, and  It doesn't help how easy this game is. Anything one would consider ""challenging"" about it is how you run out of ammo in the midst of every other SBD/Droideka/Spider-Droid/Magna-Guard ""Ambush"". Because of the game's repetitive tendancies, the little length that the game has seems like less of an issue. The game does have it's moments though. For example, I personally found it fun mowing down Battle Droids and Geonosians every once in a while. The game's soundtrack was an enjoyable mix of music from the Prequel Trilogy, a bit of music from the Original Trilogy, and some original music written specifically for this game. Soundtrack aside, the graphics of this game compliment the feel of being in the Star Wars universe as well. Despite all the problems the game has, it still has that charm to it that many other Star Wars games have, so I definately reccomend it			"

												This game was a bit of Fun. I'll just say this: It is old, but it is fun. To be fair, i haven't touched the multiplayer. I Gather it doesn't work without 3rd party servers but I'm not to sure so i'm reviewing this on the single player.Pro's: 1) Star wars game! usually they are pretty good and this was deinetally one of them. If you enjoy Star Wars games, play this.2) The music is honorable to the movies. It was nice to be running around with battle music from star wars going in the background, it really supported the feel of the game.3) It's a different take on the general star wars universe. Your not a Jedi (Pro and Con) which is fun for a change in the Star Wars Games.4) Wookies!!!5) The allies in your party are not full retard. They actually do damage. You can also tell them to slice, blow up doors e.t.c and although primitive it still works and add's to the gamplay.Con's:1) The AI for the enemy is just...can't say anymore than that. 2) It's an older game. There are some moments were you can tell it's aged badly.**NOTE THIS ONE IS A SPOILER**3) The storyline. It's nothing fantastic but i feel that it could of been a little bit better. I like that it's set during the clone war era, i like running around as an elite team, i don't like how the storyline is practically inexistant. And that ending! What kind of ending is that.4) It is far from a long game. The whole game took me about 5.5 hours to complete.Overall, the game is enjoyable and i definetally suggest it for a star wars fan. 7/10			"

												This game is great if you want a game with some tactics and a squad of AI team mates with actual personality that say one liners after every kill. The game play is good , a little bit linear , but the heroism of these guys is admirable. The graphics don't hold up to the ones that we have now but you can run it smoothly ( but watch out when you first enter the game , you might want to change the mouse sensitivity , plus what do you expect form a game that can run on 256MB of RAM and 64MB VRAM) and so far I haven't came across lag , only on large explosions. Finally the game is good and shows the other side of the conflict , not only the rebel part and their struggles but the comando's bravery , determination, marksmanship , skill and what actually is a united squad( not like CSGO or BF).

												If you're looking into this game, you should really get it.It's a fantastic game, it has a pretty good story, unique weapons, and you play with your squad for most of the game.The biggest part of the game is your squad. They're really amazing, you've scorch, sev, and fixer. They all have their specialties, and it's not super noticeable, but they do better than the others in their area. (Scorch- demolitions, fixer-computers/slicing, sev- weapons expert{sniping, anti-armor posts, turrets, etc.}) They listen to your orders, you can set them to do different things. You can have one guy sniping, one guy disabling the droid dispenser and still have the last one fighting head on with you. You can have them on the full offensive, you can have them staying in formation, you can have them moving carefully, ready to blow ammo into anything that moves.Plus there's the Humour. Really there's some funny jokes in there. Gotta love scorch XDThere's a really unique weapon setup in the game, you can have 3 guns. There's your standardized pistol (infinite ammo, energy recharge), the standardized rifle (with sniping and explosives attachments), and then you can have a single enemy weapon. That could be anything an enemy drops, like a geonosian beam rifle (pretty much shoots a powerful beam of energy) or a trandoshan shotgun, or even a wookie bowcaster. There's also heavy weapons you can get, like the ACP Heavy Repeater or the Wookie Rocket Launcher. Personally, by the end of the game I really only used the pistol, and the rifle attachments if I really need to.It also has a fair ammount of extra fun one time kind of stuff. Most of them come as a surprise, so I don't really wanna spoil it for you.When you play, keep in mind how useful cover can really be. You have an energy shield, which recharges, and a pistol with infinite ammo. If you can find some good cover, you can use those two together and take out just about anything with relative ease.			"

												This is a very good Star Wars game, made back in the waning days when Lucasarts still cared about video games. You take control of a squad of republic clone troopers each with his own personality (my personal fave is Sev, the cold, silent, deadly sniper on a hunt for blood). The gameplay is short, unfortunately; I think the 14 hours for my playthrough that is listed here is because I either didn't know where to go many times or my file got lost and I had to start over for some reason. At any rate, this game is a must for any hardcore Star Wars fan and perhaps even people who don't care so much about Star Wars and just want some military squad-based action in a science-fiction setting. Gameplay-wise, this game is terrific. You fight your way through jungles, heavily-fortified enemy bases, desert-terrain, etc as you carry out your missions. You can choose, in many situations, to go head-on with the enemies or sic your bloodthirsty comrades on them with the press of a button. The music and sounds are top-notch as usual in Star Wars games. You will hear the familar firing of laser blasters and roaring of wookies, not to mention the authentic Star Wars music we all know and love from the movies. Cons: Game is short, but by today's standards of 8-10 hours, I would say it fits in nicely. Perhaps the AI is a bit boring with the repeated use of ""hide behind rock, pop out and shoot, maybe toss a frag, hide again, repeat"", but let's be honest, this is the formula for most games, sadly even today. Oh, almost forgot, if I remember correctly this game has what felt like a moderate cliffhanger at the end. This is a huge con because it leaves the story unfinished I feel. It doesn't take away too much from this great game, but it still sucks. Checking online I see that a sequel was planned and then canceled. However, in 2011 there appeared to be reports that a sequel is still in the works. We will have to wait and see.9/10			"

												Very linear, hardly any replayability, but I thought it was a fun ride. There are only three missions. But all of them are quite long. Finished it at almost exactly 10 hours. Coming off from Battlefront II, I thought this game is much better in terms of presentation, especially concerning the first person view. The audio and visual effects in this one just feel more ""real"". I also like the strategy aspect of it. Fights were as much as a test of how well you issue orders as it is a test of your ability to shoot things. Though I found that it was really easy to just run and knife scores of enemies so long as there isn't a ""heavy"" thrown into the mix.The ending sequence was pretty anti-climactic. The endings for the first two missions were harder and more tense.			"

And after all these years and with all the Next Gen FPS titles out today, theres just something about this game that sets it apart from all other games that are out today. Of course the graphics are outdated, but the gameplay is just incredible and the story is actually very interesting! I think it would be absolutely amazing if the there could be a sequal to this game, or even a remake! Playing this game using today's technology would be greatest thing since sliced bread!			"

												Absolutley loved this game when it was new, was so excited about it back then I baught my first ever new aftermarket Graphics/video Card in order to play it at the best settings and it was beautiful. So many years later and the game is still awesome. Although the online multiplayer comunity has died since then, the gameplay is still just as fun and the squad A.I. and simple commands are still one of the best I've come across. In adddition I came to really like the squadmates as their own characters with their little banter back and forth. However I do have to point out and easily over looked physics issue, as the ""ragdoll bodies"" was new back then, sometimes the dead enemy units shake/twitch/jiggle about one the ground for a bit. Personally I think it's funny looking, but it is noticeable and you might see it a few times throughout the game. Other than that, the game is pretty much flawless in terms of squad shooter gameplay and audio  This game deserves a good sequal, but unfortunately probably won't get one. Anyways I'd recomend this game if you enjoy shooters and anything Star Wars, if you're not a fan of either, then this game may not be for you.			"

												After the Jedi Knight/Dark Forces series started focusing more on Lightsaber battles and Force powers (which was eventually expanded even further in the Force Unleashed games) it was refreshing to play a good ol'-fashioned, Star Wars shooter again. The use of Star Wars assets isn't exactly done with the most accurate attention to detail, as the design of the droids and other baddies look very little like their saga counterparts, and the weapons would look very out of place in Lucas' universe, but the gameplay and level design more than make up for it. This is a short-but-sweet, fun, squad-based shooter, which doesn't try to be too clever or reinvent the wheel.It's incredible there was never a follow-up, considering the success of the game and the subsequent success of the Clone Wars TV series (which even featured a cameo by the Republic Commando squad), but who knows, maybe one day...

Telling them what formation to be in, or what foes to target. This game is just simply amazing, it has an AMAZING story and amazing gameplay.

												Star Wars: Republic Commando is a tactical first-person shooter set in the Star Wars universe, developed by LucasArts and published by Activision and LucasArts in 2005. The game uses the Epic Games Unreal Engine.In Star Wars: Republic Commando you play as an elite Clone Commando accompanied by three other squad members through three main missions with submissions included. In the game you investigate hostile areas and search for enemy Intel. You are Delta RC-1138 (Boss, orange suit), the leader of Delta 38 who meet up with Delta RC-1262 (Scorch, yellow suit), Delta RC-1140 (Fixer, green suit) and Delta RC-1207 (Sev, red suit). These elite Clone commandos are created at the clone factories on Kamino. As a squad leader you can order your squad members to attack, defend a position or blow up blockades and each squad member has its own abilities. During your military operations you will find yourself at Geonosis (Rocky desert planet) where droids are manufactured, at the Republic Assault Ship (RAS) and at Kashyyyk (Wookie Forest/Swamps Planet).I highly enjoyed this game because tactical functions and of the HUD (Head Up Display) interface which is built inside the Helmet of your character. Also the weapon designs are well done, for instance the DC-17m Commando Rifle Model which is an adaptable rifle of the Galactic Republic. You can change parts of the gun while in battle and switch a modular sniper- or anti-armor grenade launcher attachment when you progress into the storyline. I also liked the hidden blade (Knuckle Plate Vibro Blade) which comes in handy when you are out of ammunition or just for dealing massive damage in close-combat. The voice acting is great and the interaction between squad members makes the game feel lively. I highly recommend this game to people who like the Star Wars Universe or tactical first-person Sci-Fi shooters with great gameplay, certainly when the game is on sale! "

												This, in my personal opinon, is the best Star Wars game in the entire collection even to date. This game is rich in story, has great character build, and actually has a lot of content for a game that is going on 11 years old. I played this game when I was younger on the original Xbox console, and replaying it on my PC was amazing. I love this game and all its glory even to this date. You should definately play the game.Pros:Story richBeautiful character design and art style (even though the graphics are outdated seeing as this game came out in 2005)Quite a bit of contentVoice actors feel natural and make the funny/serious dialogue in the game so much betterQuite a bit of enemy varietyLocation variertyFunny dialogueCons:Slight glitches with character movement ocasinallySometimes some of the AI within the game don't target you as quickly as they shouldSometimes Delta Squad doesn't listen to comands (happened twice through my entire 8.5 hours)Overall, this game is a ton of fun even today, and the game is worth picking up when on a sale or if you happen to have a spare $10 in your Steam wallet.11/10 Seriously, the game is that much fun.SPOILER BELOW:WHY THE HELL DID SEV HAVE TO GET LEFT BEHIND?!

												One of the best games to come out of Lucasarts before Disney happened. It takes on a darker tone of the Star Wars universe through the eyes of the leader of the Clone Commandos, but maintains the clanker-bashing droid-exploding childish fun that you know you love. Oh, and did I mention, the multiplayer is pretty sick too ;)			"

												'Best Star Wars game of the genre'This game although dated visually, (that said it is perfectly playable) has so much still going for it 10 years after it's intial release.I played through it twice back in the day (before kids), and hung out for a sequal - as it leaves you begging for more!I'm playing it now for the 3rd time.PROs+innovative AND effective teamplay controls. They feel right and work well+voice acting is top notch (Temura Morrison)+soundtrack, ahead of its time for 2005 and much darker and/or militaristic than other star wars gamesCONs+none, other than it's old+It's not a long gameif you dont have it get it!

												Unlike a lot of people, I only thought this game was okay (I'm giving it a positive review, but only just). I also believe that a lot of this game's positive reviews are a result of nostalgia (or being a devout Star Wars fan) at its best. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a MASSIVE Star Wars fan, which is exactly why I'm being honest. The idea for the game was great, and parts of it are fun, but it could have been done much better. Killing Super Battle Droids was just too time consuming. Pumping clip after clip of ammo into them just got monotonous very quickly. I did however like the conclusion of the story and thought the music was great.The multiplayer is a different story altogether. It reminded of Halo, to an extent (especially when everyone is grabbing a rocket launcher) and had solid enough gameplay which makes it fun with a few friends.In short, if you want a great Star Wars shooter get Battlefront II with some mods, you won't regret. I would still however pick up this game if it was on sale for the right amount since it's about as solid as any other average FPS.			"

												A fantastic game!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I dont really know what to say, as its all ready famouse. Well this is a Star Wars game set in the Clone wars Universe, and you are playing as the Elite Delta Squad. (cant get any better than that :P) Furthermore its a First Person Shooter, with some pretty amazing graphics and the best sound u can get as its coming form Foley sound artists that created all the sound in the movies too, the best sound made form natural resourses, making Star Wars the best. ^^ Lastly u possibly cant get better than this, the main character the Delta Squad leader that you play (Delta 32) is voiced by the one and only: Temuera Morrison, the voice of Jango Fett, the notorious Bounty Hunter from the Star Wars movie: Attack of the Clones ^^Whats not to like??Star Wars game, in a First Person Shooter, and the character u play is voiced by flipping Jango Fett!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

												One of my all time favorites and best selling game in the star wars franchise behind battlefront, Republic commando gave me a glimpse into the darker and somewhat gory side of the star wars universe. the game features delta squad fighting its way through several missions and defeating iconic foes such as the droids, trandosians, and geonosians. the game has decent graphic for a 2006 game and i must say it really out did themselfs developing the charactors and evironments they encounter throughout the game. i would say that if your a star wars fan, PICK UP THIS GAME, it is a must play and really hooked me on the franchise.

												Okay to get this out before I had internet or even a steam profile I played the hell out of this game and loved it, I recently saw it on steam and was like ♥♥♥♥ yeah I want this game and got it.At the time when i played this alot i played this and halo 1 & 2 since no other halo is on PC and this game always remided me of halo if it was about star wars. Now i most likely made a bunch of people mad saying its like halo but its really the way it looks than how it playsThis game is great, Its one of those star wars games that was done right and live up to a single player star wars game. Compared to the newer star wars games from EA I would rather play this and if EA ever tried to make a game like this, to be a good game it needs to be a carbon copy pretty much. The game runs just fine for me on windows 10 no crashs and of corse no FPS problems. If u are a fan of star wars and is looking for a game that is a fun first person shooter that does not suck and can run on anything this is the game for you.Today they honestly dont make games like this anymore and its sad			"

												I love this. I finished the game twice long before having a steam account, just for clarification. As a diehard Star Wars fan, I've always loved the alternate takes on the universe. Sure, I love Jedis, lightsabers and stuff, but most of all I love how Luke is just a simple farmer, Han is a regular smuggler and there are so many ordinary characters and all of them interesting; and what interests me the most is - what's going on beside the stuff we know from the movies? Aaaaand there you go, play Republic Commando. It's Star Wars by all means but it also isn't. It's a great shooter and even without all the mods out there, it still stands tall these days. Looks good, plays great and the atmosphere of the brotherly love felt among the commandos despite all of them being so epic and tough is amazing. IMPORTANT NOTE: the game is difficult as hell and you'll die a lot. Meaning on the HARD difficulty.			"

												After the Jedi Knight/Dark Forces series started focusing more on Lightsaber battles and Force powers (which was eventually expanded even further in the Force Unleashed games) it was refreshing to play a good ol'-fashioned, Star Wars shooter again. The use of Star Wars assets isn't exactly done with the most accurate attention to detail, as the design of the droids and other baddies look very little like their saga counterparts, and the weapons would look very out of place in Lucas' universe, but the gameplay and level design more than make up for it. This is a short-but-sweet, fun, squad-based shooter, which doesn't try to be too clever or reinvent the wheel.It's incredible there was never a follow-up, considering the success of the game and the subsequent success of the Clone Wars TV series (which even featured a cameo by the Republic Commando squad), but who knows, maybe one day...

Telling them what formation to be in, or what foes to target. This game is just simply amazing, it has an AMAZING story and amazing gameplay. Star Wars fan, new or old, you definitely need this in your collection. Besides... Screw lightsabers when you have a good ol' blaster!			"

												Star Wars Republic Commando is a first-person shooter about four deadly commandos, the Delta squad, helping the Republic's war effort. You take direct control of the squad's leader, Boss, while he guides his comrades, Sev, Scorch and Fixer, through their missions against the separatists forces.The main beef of the game is indeed to issue orders to your squad (set a demolition charge here, destroy that specific target, ...) in order to advance in the levels. Thankfully your mates' AI is quite handy and won't give you any serious problems, aside from some rare instances (it's worth mentioning that you and your clones aren't friendly fire-proof and your comrades have an annoying tendency to lock themselves into place if facing a mine field). The members of delta Squad can even revive each other if put down, which is rather fortunate.You can access a wide array of weapons (an assault and a sniper rifle, a bazooka of some kind, a pistol, ...) in order to battle several rather challenging enemies. The opponents in Republic Commando are indeed very hard to defeat and range from suicidal infantry units with little sense of survival to very sturdy and hard-hitting mini-bosses who can dish out a lot of damage towards your squad. You don't get to face any real boss, though.Republic Commando's rather short lenght is a well-known fact: it clocks around six or seven hours of gameplay. Many players tend to overlook this in favor of the game's great atmosphere, good soundtrack and solid gameplay, on top of providing a videogame about Star Wars without the usual Jedi and the Force angle and packed with a more gritty and edgier concept			"

												Star Wars: Republic Commando is quite possibly the most fun game I have ever played...no exaggeration.Republic Commando is a FPS that was released back in 2005 but stills holds up today as an extremely fun game. In the game, you play as RC-1138, AKA 'Boss', who is the...well...BOSS of an elite clone commando squad known as Delta Squad. You have 3 squadmates: Scorch, the munitions expert, Fixer, the computer slicer, and Sev, the sniper. The 4 of you go on many, many missions across the galaxy and basically destroy everyone in your path. The mechanics of the game are surprisingly smooth and it's easy to get the hang of. You know how to aim at things? You're all good. This game is so worth it for the price not only because of how fun it is, but because of the length of the campaign. I think we've all bought a game and had fun with it but were left short-handed because of how small the campaign was. No worrying about that with this game. You get a blaster rifle, a sniper, shotgun, pistol, grenades, and even a grenade launcher to blow your enemies to hell all while your squad mates are bantering with each other...which is probably one of the best parts of the game.TL;DR Here is a pros and cons listPROS-Good amount of content-Smooth mechanics-Squad banter-Good graphics for its release date-No extra BS. You shoot things.CONS-There isn't a sequel.......YET.(I don't have much play time on Steam at all because I mostly played it on my CD version.)			"

With you there are three other commandos that you give orders in field during each mission,such as slicing door,planting detonators etc. The graphics are nothing to boost about,they are what 2005 games looked like in the day,but the music is great seeing as it triggers only in the right moments. The gameplay is pretty satisfaying and it really makes this game the best FPS i ever played.  The only thing i didn't like about this game is how it has a range of 8-10 hours of campaign,which is pretty short. Even more if you consider that the game ends abruptly AND with a cliffhanger,with a sequel that may never be made.			"

												Tons of fun to play. Not only was it great back when I was a kid, but it is still pretty good today. Its a shame that there was no sequel following this game but still, definitely worth getting if you haven't tried it. It was games like these that helped me to appreciate the greater Star Wars universe as a kid, and even today the Clone Wars era has a place in my heart. The story is actually pretty good for what seems to be a weird Star Wars title and it was pretty interesting how games like this and the series gave more and more development to these faceless hordes of troopers. The gameplay itself is also quite good and a tad more mature then some more typical Star Wars games of late. Overall, I'd recommend this title to anyone looking for a fun Star Wars games. 8/10			"

												Star Wars Republic Commando is an fps game released in the star wars universe in 2005. In 2015 it still remains one of the best Star War games ever to be created and im trully sad to admit, i didnt appreciate it in its time of release. Back at the time i felt the game was really hard even on normal and i couldnt get accustomised with the various game mechanics. Now that im a bit older (but certaintly not wiser ^^), i came to appreciate this awesome title in all its grandeur.In this game you play the leader of a republic commando team, whose purpose is espionage,sabotage and advanced reconnaisssance. Obviously stealth is out of the question for like 95% of the game but the rest are yours for the making. Your team includes 3 more members each specializing in its own field. You get your sniper, your demo man and your enginneer as well. Throughout the game you are called to make tactical decisions and place your team8s around the field, in order to maximize your chances of survival and win your confrontations. Its sounds easy to do and at first it is, but as the game evolves your desicions must evolve as well.  All and all that was one aspect i enjoyed the most in this game. As with any good fps, you get to use a lot of different weapons and grenades and you can further enchance your own weapons to meet any kind of enemy. From the simple laser pistol to a full rocket launcher, this game has it all and more.In terms of gameplay difficulty, the game is not as hard as you might think, but its harder that most of todays standard measures. You dont get to do rambo stuff, cause you will be facing the ground and w8 for your m8s to revive you and that is really nervebreaking. All the levels have a linear design as well, so you wont miss your next objective. Maybe for most that is considered a down, but i think it works pretty well for this game.The graphics arent on par with todays standards, but you can modify the texture pack anyway you like and you can increase the games resolution as well. On the plus side even if you dont it still looks ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. And as with any star wars game that respects itself, the audio is one of the best things in this game. Everything from the tiniest footstep to the biggest blast has been exceptional and thats something i cant say for most games these days.The dialogues are grimm and funny at the same time and the voices seem to match everyone and everything in this game.All and all i recommend this game to everyone. If you are a fan of fps you will love it, if you are a fan of star wars you will love it even more and even if you dont like fps try it. You will love it too!!!			"

The best location in the game in my opinion is the Clone's Starship ""Executor"".			"

												Although at first glance this game seems like it is a waste of any money at all, especially coming out near the attack of the clone game, it is one of the best star wars games I have played. This is my second favorite star wars shooter, barley falling below BattleFront 2. The Story is amazing, the atmosphere makes you feel like a badass, while at the same time feeling so weak and fragile. (Especially when fighting Super Battle Droids) This game is a must with either friends or being alone, as the AI will follow orders and even in today's standards are smart and think well. The HUD idea is great, it gives the look as if you are the clone itself. The graphics hold well, and the combat is spectacular. After playing this, you will have a craving for a sequel, and want to have a higher standard in today's shooter games. 10 out of 10. I enjoyed getting this game while being on sale.			"

												This game is fantastic in almost everyway, particular emphasis on ALMOST, as there is one particular part about it that you should consider before getting this game.But before I do that, let us discuss what is great about this game, which is a lot. For starters, the gameplay in general is nothing short of amazing and gritty. The gunplay between the various different types of weapons (really attachments to one gun that all do different stuff but w/e) is satisfying. Most battles are often ripe with tension thanks to the more or less competant AI. The game also has a squad system. Wherever you go, you have about three other clones with you to help you out in battle. Like the enemy AI, they can hold their own fine. I especially like how they sometimes go into weird fighting animations with other enemies that they never lose. You can command these troopers to do certain stuff, like blow open doors, hack open doors, take up sniping positions, heal themselves, etc. This provides some level of strategy, though it's usually obvious what you want to do when you do it due to conveinient placement. Now, if any of your members (including yourself) ends up biting the dust, then you or another member can help them back up. Overall, the system works well enough, and  I reccommend you learn it fast.Normally, something like this would be good, but the game continues to impress with its characters and story. Just in case none of you know, this game takes place throughout the Clone Wars of the Prequel Films. It centers on Delta Squad, a four-man squad of elite clone troopers, who are genetically modified soldiers. Essentially ten-year trained badasses. However, the different types of personalities between the four all make sense. Boss, the clone you play as, is more or less uptight, but compassionate and caring for his men. Fixer is by-the-book, standard soldier guy. Sev is dark and overall creepy, but you grow to love the guy due to his wisecracking remarks with his fellow squadmates as well as his ruthless combat skills. Finally, there's Scorch, who is hilarious in every way. Throughout the story, you grow to care about them and what they go through, something you wouldn't normally expect from a game focusing on emotionless military badasses.The story itself is grand, if short (clocks in around 6-7 hours at most.) You get lead through planets like Kashyyk, an abandoned ship, and Geonosis.Overall, the game is amazing... except for one thing.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This game is unstable as hell. I don't know what it is, but there is a possibilty your game will crash as soon as you make a new game and play the first mission. And when I say that, I mean as your guy literally lands on the ♥♥♥♥ing ground. Fixes have been made for this, but they don't work for me. So take that into consideration.9/10 "

												Still a great game, very happy to pick it up on sale as I never completed it back in the day.It CAN be run at 1080p, but you'll need to use a hex editor to change the aspect ratio to 16:9 and open up a .ini file with notepad (or your text editor of choice) to incease the resolution to 1920x1080.  It's VERY VERY easy to do this, but if you don't understand these basic terms and plan to ♥♥♥♥♥ endlessly about not having native 1080p in a 2005 game, you've only got yourself to blame.			"

												Star Wars: Republic CommandoThis is a Star Wars FPS that puts you in control of a squad of elite clones, better known as Delta Squad. Your squad members have different personalities. Funny, reckless, and serious. You have to complete campaigns, which can take quite a long time to complete. Your squad members have different abilities, one's good at explosives, one's good at computers, and one's good at sniping. You can assign them to do things. The shooting is like CoD, but the graphics are a bit outdated. I'd recommend this game, it's a good Star Wars FPS  game - possibly one of the best made. 9.5/10			"

												Star Wars Republic Commando, Knights of the Old Republic, and Battlefront 1 are considered the Holy Trinity of Star Wars games.  You can put Rogue Squadron in there as well, but these three are always the ones everyone always talks about.  Republic Commando is an FPS set during the period of the Clone Wars where you command an elite clone unit called Delta Squad.  As you travel throughout the galaxy and undergo missions you will be faced with very difficult challenges, very immersive gameplay, and a cast of characters you will never forget.  This is a no-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game.  It's hard, it's fun, and it leaves you begging for more.  I remember this game came out during the time of Halo 1 and after playing both I thought Republic Commando just kicked way much more♥♥♥♥♥  This is a game you must play if you're a Star Wars fan or an FPS fan.  You will be hooked right as soon as you give your squad that first ""BREACH THAT DOOR"" command.I'm giving this game a strong 9.5/10.			"

												This game. THIS GAME. This game, if I'm correct, is the reason I joined Steam. When I was younger, I used to watch videos of the campaign. I thought it was the coolest thing ever when they would knife a Geonosian and blood got over the screen, only to be taken away by a laser. I wanted it so bad, so when someone I know showed it to me on Steam, I ran straight home and installed Steam. I do not regret sitting there and watching the install screen for two hours. I really wish more people had known about the game in it's time, because then there would've been a sequel. The ending is just a huge cliffhanger, and I need to know what happens.This game deserves a 10/10. Hands-down.			"

												Clear Space Hulks, blow up vital bridges, and play a vital (if now unrecognized) role in a war you were born to fight as a member of the elite Delta Squad! The game itself is quite old, and unfortunately has not aged as well as most. However, if you're a die-hard Star Wars fan, a classic FPS connoisseur, or a nostalgia junkie, this is well worth the now discounted price of admission. Multiplayer via Gamespy is dead (and has been for years, as most of you already know), but Multiplayer via direct-connect servers or Gameranger are available (If that's your thing). Regardless, If you're itching for something old, with maybe a little bit of mold attached, look no further!			"

												One of the most fun and challenging Star Wars games to date.  Don't bother reading the negative reviews, they're all just Call Of Duty fanboys expecting a Star Wars version of their favorite game, which it is not. This game actually requires you to try and to think, not just run around  one shotting every enemy you see while you take a thousand hits and not die. Enemies take time to kill, and some require teamwork to take down. The characters are pretty awesome and as the game progresses, it gets more challenging and more interesting. It's always fun to stab a B1 Battle Droid and see its insides splatter on your hud, then see your teammate tackle a Droideka and smash its head in. Even seeing another teammate snap a Geonosians head. It's just an incredible game. Anybody who says otherwise, is an idiot and has no taste in games whatsoever. Buy this game.You think this is a joke?   Buy it already.    "

												Quite possibly the best Star Wars licenced game out there in my opinion. I have fond memories of playing this when I was 7 or 8 years old back in the day, and the game has not aged AT ALL. Smart squad commands, challenging enemies, a wide and interesting array of weapons and some of the best voicework in a game I have seen. Its not just a great star wars game, but its a great shooter as well. Highly RecommendedPros-Intuitive and innovative squad commands-Interesting weapons, like the Trandoshan projectile weapons and the DC15 system-Great AI, both enemy and teammates-Brutal difficulty even on normal-Wide array of enemy types, and you even get to see characters such as Yoda and General Grevious!Cons-Pretty short, clocked in about 6 hours-Buggy in some sections'-NO SEQUEL			"

												Star Wars Republic Commando (or as I like to call it also, Band of Clone Bros) is the forgotten and underrated Star Wars video game that everybody that loves the Star Wars franchise should play. The story of the game is based on the 2nd and 3rd movies of the prequel trilogy, where you play as the leader of a Spec Ops squad of 4 Clones of the Galactic Republic who are responsible for performing special missions that occure behind the scenes of the Clone Wars. This is a squad based game, where using your squad team seriously will be your road for victory. The fact that you play as a Clone, fighting along aside with a team of other Clones, breaks the monotony of the usual protagonists of a story of a Star Wars game, which tend to be Jedis, Siths or some random bounty hunter.I agree, like the vast majority of people who played it, that this is a good game - but not a perfect one. It has one problem that I felt frustrated about: while the enemy was agressive against you, your squad team will be very weak and will lack agressivness, unless you babysit them all the time. Sometimes, they will just get close to an enemy and try killing them by melee (it reminds me of the Warscape Engine BS that is now plaguing the Total War series...), instead of trying to get to cover by their own initiative. Another problem  that I have with the game is the lack of variety with the level designs: the game is divided only by 3 chapters, which are limited equally to 3 areas (first you fight in one planet, then inside a ship, and then again in another planet). A little bit of more effort from the producers of this videogame could have created more variety for you to be present in another scenarios/planets of the Clone Wars. But I believe this problem to be minor, when you compare to the much more positive aspects of the game.Still, I cannot recommend you buy it at full price (except if your are a Star Wars nerd :P), since it is an old game and it no longer has an active multiplayermode. Buy it only when it´s in promotion.Like many people claim, this game really needs a sequel - where you play as the same squad team, now part of the forces of the eeeeeeeevil Galactic Empire. It would have been a much better sequel to make instead of the disaster that was Star Wars ""BattleFront"" EA (THE GAME IS NOT WORTH OF DESERVING OF ""BATTELFRONT"" ON IT´S TITLE!!!). Unfortunatelly, this game appears to have been forgotten and I don´t think a sequel (or a reboot) will ever be created.7.5 out of 10 "

This game has substance, which is why I have come back to it many, many times.The abundant chatter between your squad mates, the constant challenging action-filled battling against droids, Geonosians, & Trandoshians, the strategic commanding of your squadmates, and the constant changing of your objectives, make this game feel immersive, challenging, and a title that you will want to come back and play time and time again.

												Gritty, dark, and a heck of a lot of fun to play, Star Wars: Republic Commando is a first person tactial shooter that finds the perfect balance between strategy and action.Whereas most First-Person shooters take the action route there are still a few extreme tactical and strategy based military such as the Tom Clancy: Rainbow Six series. The Rainbow Six series takes a linear strategy and tactical based approach to military operations. The game focuses on the ""How to"" rather than the ""What to."" The problem with games like this is that they combine the complex strategy with a genre that most people prefer to stay focused on the ""What to."" First-Person Shooters. Therefore creating an issue. You have those who love it because it of it strict strategy focus and then you have those who hate it because it doesn't have enough action. Republic Commando solves this issue...It blends (and balances) the action with the strategy. Featuring a one key strategy system you can command your squad members directly and quickly. No sub-menus, no complicated explanation. Just push and play. One of the games main features is a excellent AI system. And boy is it good...You squad members know how to fight and how to do it efficiently. They automatically take cover and stay focused on the objective. They eliminate the primary targets first and take on the secondary ones later. The first time playing the game through, I found myself dying more than the AI! Now that is good...The gameplay is fast paced, frantic, and exciting. It perfectly balances strategy and action.The graphics are...meh...In their day they were probably amazing. But now a dated Quake engine remains. Don't get me wrong the graphics aren't bad, but by today's standards they are a little old, but acceptable. The sound is good and the soundtrack is perfect. The soundtrack by Jesse Harlin is a great blend of dark overtones, action sequences, and excellent buildup. The sound effects in game sound exactly like Star Wars.The campaign is extremely fun. It isn't even much of a campaign. It is just three big missions broken up into small parts. I have probably played the game's through about 7 times. My only complaint about the campaign is the rather abrupt ending. Now I won't spoil anything but it will leave you feeling like...""WHAT! THAT'S IT! THAT WASN'T HOW IT WAS SUPPOSED TO END! THERE WAS SOOOOO MUCH BUILD UP! COME ON!""Then you will go frantically searching the web to try and find if there is a sequal. And you'll find this: CancelledAnd when your all done you can play the multiplayer! Which is fun, but pretty much dead...So in short this game is awesome. Go get it!Overall Rating: 7.5/10Presentation: 10/10Story: 8/10Gameplay: 7/10Graphics: 6.5/10Sound: 9/10Lasting Appeal: 7/10Overall Rating: 7.5/10Content Review:Star Wars: Republic Commando is a tough game to review in terms of content. While much of the game is dark, gritty, and permeated by death, on has tot take int the account the fact that...well...it's Star Wars. This is (so far) the most violent Star Wars Video Game to date. Thankfully, violence is the only category that scores high in this game, in terms of content.Positive Elements: You fight on the good side. You stand for morals such as teamwork, unity, and justice. Teamwork is essential to success in the game.6/10 (Moderate) Violence: The game is a First Person Shooter, so some violence is expected. What is different about this game game though in comparison to previous Star Wars games is that it features an extensive amount of blood, gore, and corpses. The Genossian bug enemy's you fight break into bits and pieces when killed. If you shoot an enemy up close blood will splatter on your visor only to be removed by a wiper blade seconds later. When shooting at an enemy you can see spurts of blood flying off. Combat is highlighted by screams, cries of pain, and yelling. In addition to all that, many bodies of human clones are found scattered throughout the game.3/10 (Infrequent/Mild) Language: D--n and Hell are used occasionally. Insults like, clankers, and scumbag are uttered with frequency.0/10 (None) Sexual Content: :)0/10 (None) Drugs/Alcohol: :)4/10 (Present) Negative Elements: Death permeates the environment. Much of the game is dark and has a bleak outlook on things. Frequently the Commandos quote from their fake rule book which says things like ""Rule Number 1: Kill them before they kill you.""Other Moral Issues: The weird mystical Force is mentioned (e.g.""May the force be with you."") but never elaborated on. The Commandos are cloned from another human being, as are many of the other soldiers you see in game. Final Content Rating: 5.5 (Acceptable)Key Elements- Violent - Gritty and Dark- Death permeates the environment- Infrequent Mild Language			"

												Well, whatever people have to praise about in this game has already been posted, and as you can see I recommend this for pretty much the same reasons. Great gameplay, great soundtrack, great experience overall, but yet I really want to warn this to anyone reading this review. The ending is too abrupt, you're led to believe that things are only beggining, that the game is at it's crucial point with a plot twist incoming... and then it ends. I loved the story but I have to admit it was one of the WORST moments to ever end a game, specially one this good. So yeah, you've been warned. Still worth buying though.			"

												If any game in the Star Wars universe needs a sequel it is this game. As short and repetive as this game can get Republic Commando at least gave you exactly what you expected without any fluff or bullcrap. The game isn't perfect but it was the best at what it needed to do at the time. I dont care who or what i have to do in this world to get another of this game, but the idea of a strategic team of clones running around behind the scenes of war and doing things that you havent heard of for good reason is a brilliant way to add to the Star Wars universe without ever having to break Cannon or mold to the story. They can be anywhere doing anything and the story will always make sense as long as they dont fight or kill important characters to the rest of the universe. I love it.			"

												STAR WARS: Republic Commando, a video game that takes place between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith, is an ideal example for a STAR WARS game about ordinary soldiers.  Fun, humorous, and unique, its pros outway its cons, but the problems can still pop up.Plot:You are Delta 38, the leader of a group of elite clone commandos working for the republic.  You, along with your team, must do the jobs that are too big to know about and too extreme for a regular clone.  Your team is the greatest weapon you have.  Versatile, yet disfunctional, your squad consist of 07 AKA Sev, a vicious hunter who rarely ever misses, 62 AKA Scorch, the demolitions expert with the maturity of a teenager, and 40 AKA Fixer, your second-in-command and tech head who is serious, yet pure of heart.  They will either cheer for you or jeer at you.  Nevertheless, you four are family, and that's how it will always be.PROS: - Good characters you can invest in- Spectacular wepons- The squad moves and operates like real life soldiers- Very funny catchphrases and jeers- Unique locations- Distinctive weapons- Extras are interestingCONS:- Not a lot of locations- Gameplay takes some getting use to- No controller functionality			"

												I remember the first time I put that disk, that artwork of Delta Squad giving me excitement, waiting for this game to finish installing so I could play as a Clone Commando. I was 15, perhaps, maybe 14. Being a Star Wars fan, spending hours playing Knights of the Old Republic, Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy.Got this on a discount a while ago, wanted to have my old games on Steam. - and still, this feels so damn good.Nostalgia isn't a reason to still hype over this game. Republic Commando did define the First Person Shooter genre, combining a Squad-based Gameplay with a Tactical Shooter. You play your cards right, you don't die. Still, many shooters can't reach this level, they can't make a fast gameplay combined with team management in the middle of the combat. This game gave us a choice to place our commandos in the right places, managing our resources between having more firepower and getting the job done. Not the best variety of weapons, sure; still leading a group of four in various scenarios is enough to get yourself in a challange.If anything, it's worth playing for the story itself. Being a ""Deluxe Model"" in a Clone Army, leading a squad of Clone Commandos with different characteristics. Listening to them trashing at each other, commenting on kills and reacting to your actions. Well-designed, well-thought.To this day, Republic Commando is still one of the most feature-rich First Person Shooters out there. Still looking good, still has a damn-good story, still enojyable, still challanging. - Do you like First Person Shooters? Then, this is a must have.			"

												A not so long time ago in a country not far far away came a game so good we would ask for a sequel for ten years after release and still has not got one yet. This is star wars Republic Commandos. In the introduction you are shown the early years of a clone through quick clips of training introducing your squad. Your excellently written and acted squad is comprised of Fixer, the hacker and technical expert, Sev who is the hunter and sniper of the group who jokes around with Scorch, the demolitions expert who is always telling jokes at the worst of times. You and your squad fight on iconic planets from the movies such as Geonosis and Kashyyyk doing missons such as killing geonosian leaders, blowing up droid factories and saving wookie generals. The game is a first person shooter (obviously) with some strategy elements involved via squad commands such as ordering your troops to move to tactical positions, provide covering fire, attack targeted enemies and seize objectives. Certain actions will play to a commando's strengths like Sev is the best with a sniper and Scorch arms explosives faster and Fixer hacks quicker. This game looks good even though it came out about a decade ago and has really nice level design. The campaign is short lasting about 5-7 hours but it makes you eager for more and the story set up a sequel which we unfortunately never got but i hope that one day we will. All in all i give this game an 8/10, i would have rated if the campaign was slightly longer.			"

												This game is fantastic in almost everyway, particular emphasis on ALMOST, as there is one particular part about it that you should consider before getting this game.But before I do that, let us discuss what is great about this game, which is a lot. For starters, the gameplay in general is nothing short of amazing and gritty. The gunplay between the various different types of weapons (really attachments to one gun that all do different stuff but w/e) is satisfying. Most battles are often ripe with tension thanks to the more or less competant AI. The game also has a squad system. Wherever you go, you have about three other clones with you to help you out in battle. Like the enemy AI, they can hold their own fine. I especially like how they sometimes go into weird fighting animations with other enemies that they never lose. You can command these troopers to do certain stuff, like blow open doors, hack open doors, take up sniping positions, heal themselves, etc. This provides some level of strategy, though it's usually obvious what you want to do when you do it due to conveinient placement. Now, if any of your members (including yourself) ends up biting the dust, then you or another member can help them back up. Overall, the system works well enough, and  I reccommend you learn it fast.Normally, something like this would be good, but the game continues to impress with its characters and story. Just in case none of you know, this game takes place throughout the Clone Wars of the Prequel Films. It centers on Delta Squad, a four-man squad of elite clone troopers, who are genetically modified soldiers. Essentially ten-year trained badasses. However, the different types of personalities between the four all make sense. Boss, the clone you play as, is more or less uptight, but compassionate and caring for his men. Fixer is by-the-book, standard soldier guy. Sev is dark and overall creepy, but you grow to love the guy due to his wisecracking remarks with his fellow squadmates as well as his ruthless combat skills. Finally, there's Scorch, who is hilarious in every way. Throughout the story, you grow to care about them and what they go through, something you wouldn't normally expect from a game focusing on emotionless military badasses.The story itself is grand, if short (clocks in around 6-7 hours at most.) You get lead through planets like Kashyyk, an abandoned ship, and Geonosis.Overall, the game is amazing... except for one thing.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This game is unstable as hell. I don't know what it is, but there is a possibilty your game will crash as soon as you make a new game and play the first mission. And when I say that, I mean as your guy literally lands on the ♥♥♥♥ing ground. Fixes have been made for this, but they don't work for me. So take that into consideration.9/10 "

												One of the best star wars games ever, Republic commando puts you in the boots of an elite commando. Based during the early days of the clone wars just after the movie star wars ep. 2.Essentially a solid squad shooter with light  tactical elements, Republic commando creates the most gritty view of the star wars world ever seen.Top quality Star Wars game that should belong in any fans collection.

As a fan of the Clone Wars, I can see where a lot of inspiration for the characteristics and plot design are inspired by this game. It is also an extremely challenging game, and you need to latch on to exactly how to destroy enemies and their weaknesses. There are even times I played and just ragequit from how hard it became. "

												Although at first glance this game seems like it is a waste of any money at all, especially coming out near the attack of the clone game, it is one of the best star wars games I have played. This is my second favorite star wars shooter, barley falling below BattleFront 2. The Story is amazing, the atmosphere makes you feel like a badass, while at the same time feeling so weak and fragile. (Especially when fighting Super Battle Droids) This game is a must with either friends or being alone, as the AI will follow orders and even in today's standards are smart and think well. The HUD idea is great, it gives the look as if you are the clone itself. The graphics hold well, and the combat is spectacular. After playing this, you will have a craving for a sequel, and want to have a higher standard in today's shooter games. 10 out of 10. I enjoyed getting this game while being on sale.			"

												First time I saw this, I played the demo of it on the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Xbox disc.  Original Xbox.  And I was blown away.  Fast forward nine years.  I see it on Steam, and just because I'd been wanting to play it since that day in 2006, I bought it.  I exxpected to find the game having aged like milk.  Was I wrong!  It still looked like that day that I played it on the original Xbox.  And, I tell you what; this game could hold its own against some of today's games.  No problem!  I'll admit, though, it DOES feel a bit odd, now, playing it with a mouse.  This game was a console game, and the aiming felt so good with a right stick.  Even with the Steam Controller and its trackpad, the aiming doesn't feel right, somehow.  But, I digress.  Regardless of the aiming issue, this is still oone of my favorite first person shooters, third only to UT2004, which is second only to DOOM (The original)			"

												One of the few good things to come out of the Prequel Era.The gameplay revolves around properly managing your squad, and has interesting encounters. The scope is more focused than other, grand and epic Star Wars games, but by the end of the game, you've really connected with your squad. They may all be numbers to the Jedi, but you will remember each character's colour, number, nickname, and preferences.The only unfortunate thing is that the game's premise could have easily made this a 4-player-co-op shooter, but it isn't. The multiplayer is generic and mostly bland, but the single player campaign is definitely worth it. The least enjoyable parts of the game are when you are separated from your squad, working independently. Without the squad management, it becomes a generic shooter set in the Star Wars universe.			"

												I'd say this game is worth some of your time. I love the characters (mostly Sev and Scorch) and the gameplay is fun and challenging, yet can be a little repetitive before it's all over. It took me about 7 hours to beat the game on Normal difficulty, , but (MINOR SPOILER ALERT)                                                                                                                                                  when I was starting to get really pumped after the last mission thinking there  was going to be more to it, the game just ended causing my heart to skip several beats out of serious disappointment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I do believe this game deserves a sequel yet I have a feeling that the developers might screw things up such as: making   Delta Squad as flat, generic, and emotionless protagonists or forget them at least. Overall I would give this game a 3.75/5 mostly because of length it has.			"

												This game is a great first person shooter for not just Star Wars fans, anyone looking to just have fun. It may be a relatively short game, but its replay value is astounding and it doesn't suffer from Call of Duty Syndrome. The campaign's story is an amazing experience that leaves you wishing that a sequel had been made.Unfortunately, the multiplayer on this game is very lacking. For a great Star Wars multiplayer experience, I recommend getting Star Wars Battlefront.Also, the gore level in this game is limited to a small amount of green blood, so convincing parents to buy this game is easier than most other first person shooters.

												Spectacular game!!!! I highly recommend this FPS. The controls are still fun after all of these years (11 years later) and the graphics are well worth it too since you can pick this game up for less than $5 when it goes on sale. The campaign mode is pretty short but it's pretty challanging at times. There are a few glitches in this game though which only increases the difficulty. The glitches are all with your teammates though. The AI is challenging and your squad works their butt off too. I haven't attempted to play the multi-player but the campaign alone is worth the time.Best Star Wars game to immerse you in the universe since there's a lot more in this world than Jedi and the force.

The levels are beutiful and the enemies are difficult and fun to fight. The multiplayer was underpopulated and yet still enough to be fun. A clever and great way of seeing the militaristic world of the star wars universe. A star wars game with no jedi no force and ridiculous over powerd abilities. However some glitchy AI is prevelent and the lack of a co-op system holds the game back. If this game is ever remade and remade well I believe it could a game of the year award.			"

												A great game for fans of simple, FPS shooters, but it is also a relatively hollow game, all things considered. -The gameplay is fun, and the ability to command your squad is a unique gameplay mechanic. -There are no upgrades, collectibles, or unlockables, and the levels are fairly linear. This can be good, bad, or a little of both, depending on your personal preference.-The story is minimal, but definitely there. The characters are likeable, but relatively static, and the narrative is pretty surface level. The ending is very sudden, and doesn't really give the player much resolution.-The game is very stable, with very few bugs, but the few bugs that can occur were, at least in my experience, very noticeable, though not game-breaking.-The game can be very nostalgic for fans of shooters from the mid 2000s (arguably the peak of shooter games), and the story may be quite interesting for Star Wars fans (I believe this game is still canon, in case you were wondering).-There is virtually no replayability, but considering the current price for this game, the 9-12 hours of gameply you'll get are well worth what you'll pay.-The graphics aren't bad at all, especially for its time.Overall review = 6/10 Not great, but for $9.99, certainly not bad			"

												Ah, I love this game. I remember playing it when it was on the X-box, and was is great to play it again.It's a squad based action shooter, with rather intelligent AI companions (Although they can't use any weapons other than the main gun unless in special cover). You play through the game taking place during the Clone wars as a elite squad sent on special missions, and in my opinion it really nails that atmosphere of taking on the impossible odds, as your sent against increasingly difficult hoards of enemies. Keep it mind, it isn't an RPG, there are no real choices or decisions to be made, and there is no multiplayer scene, giving it unfortunately very little replayability other than for enjoyment. It is a fun game however, and offers some of what I feel is the best squad gameplay and teamwork mechanics even compared to newer games today. Worth picking up if you just want to shoot some baddies and lead a commando team.			"

												This game feels like it should have been made in the 90s, when memorable characters and good stories came to games without question.It's an FPS where you lead a squad of clone soldiers - all who manage to have a distinct and enjoyable personality - as you tear around behind the curtains of the Star Wars universe.  You won't jumping from any rooftops in flashy lightsaber fights, but your crack team of mighty mortals finds their own way to be awesome.Squad controls are simple, too.  It reminds me of a more involved Mass Effect.  You can give general orders like fall back or take cover, but all throughout the level are little hot spots that a squade mate (or yourself) can take advantage of.  Lot of enemies in a room?  Get someone on the turret.  Just make sure you cover him on the way over there so he doesn't get shot (or you do it, and have your guys cover you).It's a surprisingly great game with a fun concept, delightful characters, and solid mechanics.  It's aged, but not so much that it's not worth $20.			"

												I wish there was a star rating for steam, because while Republic Commando is a good game, it has a lot of problems. Its singleplayer campaign is just too short, bordering the length of the original portal, and the finish is anticlimactic. You just start to connect with your AI squadmates when the campagin ends, and its kind of frustrating that they couldn't have added on another mission or two. On the positive side its a fun game with a lot of strategy and a decent enough plot, but I'd wait until it goes on sale before buying it. I also really enjoyed the mechanics for working with your AI squad mates, and I wish more FPSes did AI interaction as well as this title. All in all a good game, but with dated graphics and thats just too short.			"

												This is truly an amazing game. Take a step into the life of a clone commando, where you are responsible for the lives of your squad mates. This is one of the greatest Star Wars games of all time! Immerse yourself into the awe inspiring Star Wars World to command a clone squad, as their leader you must be responsible for their strategic actions and welfare. With the use of in-game techniques based on real Special Ops techniques, set up your squad in the best way possible to take down the CIS! In this expansion of the Star Wars universe, wield new, unique weaponry designed to fit the aliens that conceived them! This game is one of my all-time top favorites and I rate it at 10 out of 10! I have never come across such a distinctive game as this, both in story and gameplay! I recommend this to anyone who enjoys strategic gameplay, first person shooters, Star Wars, or well written story lines! ""Enemy eliminated, proceeding to next sector!""			"

												First time I saw this, I played the demo of it on the Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords Xbox disc.  Original Xbox.  And I was blown away.  Fast forward nine years.  I see it on Steam, and just because I'd been wanting to play it since that day in 2006, I bought it.  I exxpected to find the game having aged like milk.  Was I wrong!  It still looked like that day that I played it on the original Xbox.  And, I tell you what; this game could hold its own against some of today's games.  No problem!  I'll admit, though, it DOES feel a bit odd, now, playing it with a mouse.  This game was a console game, and the aiming felt so good with a right stick.  Even with the Steam Controller and its trackpad, the aiming doesn't feel right, somehow.  But, I digress.  Regardless of the aiming issue, this is still oone of my favorite first person shooters, third only to UT2004, which is second only to DOOM (The original)			"

												One of the few good things to come out of the Prequel Era.The gameplay revolves around properly managing your squad, and has interesting encounters. The scope is more focused than other, grand and epic Star Wars games, but by the end of the game, you've really connected with your squad. They may all be numbers to the Jedi, but you will remember each character's colour, number, nickname, and preferences.The only unfortunate thing is that the game's premise could have easily made this a 4-player-co-op shooter, but it isn't. The multiplayer is generic and mostly bland, but the single player campaign is definitely worth it. The least enjoyable parts of the game are when you are separated from your squad, working independently. Without the squad management, it becomes a generic shooter set in the Star Wars universe.			"

I'm not saying that they are bad, but i think that RC is the best for now =)The game is little bit short, graphics for 2014 outdated, and game has few Squad tactical features.But god damn this game has amazing atmosphere, good story line, and really good gameplay.If you are the SW fan or Clones in SW universe, you just have to have this game in your library.P.S. The best location in the game in my opinion is the Clone's Starship ""Executor"".			"

												I remember the first time I put that disk, that artwork of Delta Squad giving me excitement, waiting for this game to finish installing so I could play as a Clone Commando. I was 15, perhaps, maybe 14. Being a Star Wars fan, spending hours playing Knights of the Old Republic, Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy.Got this on a discount a while ago, wanted to have my old games on Steam. - and still, this feels so damn good.Nostalgia isn't a reason to still hype over this game. Republic Commando did define the First Person Shooter genre, combining a Squad-based Gameplay with a Tactical Shooter. You play your cards right, you don't die. Still, many shooters can't reach this level, they can't make a fast gameplay combined with team management in the middle of the combat. This game gave us a choice to place our commandos in the right places, managing our resources between having more firepower and getting the job done. Not the best variety of weapons, sure; still leading a group of four in various scenarios is enough to get yourself in a challange.If anything, it's worth playing for the story itself. Being a ""Deluxe Model"" in a Clone Army, leading a squad of Clone Commandos with different characteristics. Listening to them trashing at each other, commenting on kills and reacting to your actions. Well-designed, well-thought.To this day, Republic Commando is still one of the most feature-rich First Person Shooters out there. Still looking good, still has a damn-good story, still enojyable, still challanging. - Do you like First Person Shooters? Then, this is a must have.			"

												One of the best Star Wars games I've ever played! Every aspect of this game feels really polished, creative, and researched (well, as much as you can for a sci-fi setting). It all comes together with the gameplay to make a really immersive and surprisingly original (since it's not just re-hashing something straight out of the movies) experience.First of all, the gameplay. After my first session of this game, I actually had a lot of complaints. The enemies feel like bullet sponges - often times taking entire clips just to down one. My squadmates stand out in the open in view of a strong enemy and stupidly march to their deaths without taking cover into consideration. The reticle for the main rifle is really wide and it doesn't feel ""precise"" like I would imagine a laser weapon would feel. Even when I have an enemy in the crosshairs a lot of shots go wide. However, after my second session these complaints disappeared as I got familiarity with the gameplay. You learn the importance of grenades for taking out the high-health enemies, the importance of ordering your troops around to specific ""maneuvers"", how to hit targets with all the different weapons, and how it doesn't matter that much if your squad does dumb stuff because you can still win encounters on your own. You start to understand the tactical tradeoffs of the different maneuvers and weapons. So, if you find yourself frustrated or a bit annoyed your first time playing, give it a rest for the day and come back tomorrow.You might notice the squad-based tactics and orders system. If you've played other games like that, you might be dreading having to deal with it, but I think that it's done very well in this game. It's really simple, and they do a great job of helping you keep track of what your squad is doing. There's a lot of subtle ways they achieve this and I won't describe them all. You won't really have to micro manage what everybody is doing using all sorts of different keys - you usually just press F2 so they follow you around, and then point at things in the environment and press ""f"" to tell a squad mate to perform a specific maneuver. Because it's implemented this way, it's pretty seamless as you switch between shooting and commanding your squad. Even if you go down, your squad can sometimes manage on their own and come revive you.Anyway, it's hard to be frustrated with this game because of the great quick save and quick load system. It's really fast and makes it so you never have to worry about replaying a section over and over. If you do find yourself at a  spot where you keep failing, there's usually a ""trick"" to the encounter to overcome that spot, accomplished by intelligently using the weapons and maneuvers available to you. It's a nice way to design a game like this - a lot of the encounters are kind of like puzzles, in a way.And all that is just about the gameplay. One of the best things about this game is the detail and the immersion it achieves. I highly recommend going into the sound settings and making sure you max them out if you can, and making sure to play with headphones with the volume high enough. There's all sorts of details in all the little sounds, the writing, the UI elements, the dialogue and one-off things the characters say that manages to not get too repetitive, and lots more that needs to be experienced to be understood.If you like Star Wars games, this is one of the best. Even without that, the game is a fun, squad-based sci-fi shooter. It's actually similar to Halo in a lot of ways, so if you like that game I bet you'd enjoy this.			"

												A great game for fans of simple, FPS shooters, but it is also a relatively hollow game, all things considered. -The gameplay is fun, and the ability to command your squad is a unique gameplay mechanic. -There are no upgrades, collectibles, or unlockables, and the levels are fairly linear. This can be good, bad, or a little of both, depending on your personal preference.-The story is minimal, but definitely there. The characters are likeable, but relatively static, and the narrative is pretty surface level. The ending is very sudden, and doesn't really give the player much resolution.-The game is very stable, with very few bugs, but the few bugs that can occur were, at least in my experience, very noticeable, though not game-breaking.-The game can be very nostalgic for fans of shooters from the mid 2000s (arguably the peak of shooter games), and the story may be quite interesting for Star Wars fans (I believe this game is still canon, in case you were wondering).-There is virtually no replayability, but considering the current price for this game, the 9-12 hours of gameply you'll get are well worth what you'll pay.-The graphics aren't bad at all, especially for its time.Overall review = 6/10 Not great, but for $9.99, certainly not bad			"

												Ah, I love this game. I remember playing it when it was on the X-box, and was is great to play it again.It's a squad based action shooter, with rather intelligent AI companions (Although they can't use any weapons other than the main gun unless in special cover). You play through the game taking place during the Clone wars as a elite squad sent on special missions, and in my opinion it really nails that atmosphere of taking on the impossible odds, as your sent against increasingly difficult hoards of enemies. Keep it mind, it isn't an RPG, there are no real choices or decisions to be made, and there is no multiplayer scene, giving it unfortunately very little replayability other than for enjoyment. It is a fun game however, and offers some of what I feel is the best squad gameplay and teamwork mechanics even compared to newer games today. Worth picking up if you just want to shoot some baddies and lead a commando team.			"

												Now, im not a professional reviewer, so Ill just give you what I think compared to games today. I think this game still holds its own. The graphics are dated but gunplay and gameplay is fun. Some small AI bugs and some funny glitches, I only found ONE game breaking which happened YEARS ago. It was when a Delta got stuck in a pit and refused to do anything. I could continue level, but I reloaded it cause I didnt want him in the hole. I never got to play multi so I dont have opinion on that. I found the game fun in general and I have played through it multiple times. I think this game still holds its own, but it would be REALLY NICE if this game got a sequel. I doubt it will happen, but battle front got one, right? (Even though from what I hear so far its not good). Well, if you stuck with me this far, then I recommend if you havent already, give it a try.			"

												A fantastic game with excellent music and endearing squad humour. In my opinion it has also aged well.You are Delta 38, leader of the 4-man Delta Team who are clone troopers with advanced equipment and medical implants, as well as more personality to help with creative thinking.The gameplay mostly revolves around ordering your squad members into positions, which also tells them what weapons to use. Best of all your squad will actually do what you tell them to, even if it gets them taken out. Makes you wonder how Fallout 4 still can't fix companions standing in doorways!Know that the first area (Geonosis) is the least fun, so stick with it. As you progress the game (slowly) gives you more options, as in there will be more positions than you have squad members, so you will have to make quick decisions while under fire. The pacing gets faster as well, both from more dangerous enemies and more heavy weapons available, but also thanks to good storytelling and use of the loud, epic music this game has.There are good mods to fix common graphical issues/crashes and allow higher resolutions (I played it in 4K).Unfortunately it ends on a cliffhanger as it sets up for a sequel that never came.But yay, Wookie life-debts for everybody!

It's something different and i would higly recommend. It's got wookies in it. get it. Oh wait one more thing. This game screams, like just crazy loud in your face, 'co-operative'.

												Easily one of the best games I have ever played.When I first played this game I didn't even like Star Wars that much,but this game made me a fan.I get goosebumps only when I hear the game's soundtrack.Gameplay-wise,the game is absolutely beautifully designed.It plays out like a regular shooter game,the guns feel good and you have a decent variety of weapons and enemies.What makes the game stand out,is the tactical element of it.You give orders to your fellow Delta Squad commandos during battle.Knowing where,when and how to control them can make the game easier or harder.Going through the campaign,I never got bored because the game offers enough variety.The storyline is the icing on the cake.It keeps you engaged and makes you love the characters and the universe that they are in.The personalities in the game are fun,interesting and exciting.Even the soundtrack is one of the best in any game that I played.In the end I'd like to express my regrets that we still don't have a sequel for the game...EA please...Sev,hang in there!

In all the playthroughs over the years I haven't had a single time where the other Commandos blocked me or anything similar. They also don't just teleport around like certain other games.Otherwise it's just a very solid game overall. Level design, story, gunplay, etc. All solid.			"

												Star Wars Republic Commando (or as I like to call it also, Band of Clone Bros) is the forgotten and underrated Star Wars video game that everybody that loves the Star Wars franchise should play. The story of the game is based on the 2nd and 3rd movies of the prequel trilogy, where you play as the leader of a Spec Ops squad of 4 Clones of the Galactic Republic who are responsible for performing special missions that occure behind the scenes of the Clone Wars. This is a squad based game, where using your squad team seriously will be your road for victory. The fact that you play as a Clone, fighting along aside with a team of other Clones, breaks the monotony of the usual protagonists of a story of a Star Wars game, which tend to be Jedis, Siths or some random bounty hunter.I agree, like the vast majority of people who played it, that this is a good game - but not a perfect one. It has one problem that I felt frustrated about: while the enemy was agressive against you, your squad team will be very weak and will lack agressivness, unless you babysit them all the time. Sometimes, they will just get close to an enemy and try killing them by melee (it reminds me of the Warscape Engine BS that is now plaguing the Total War series...), instead of trying to get to cover by their own initiative. Another problem  that I have with the game is the lack of variety with the level designs: the game is divided only by 3 chapters, which are limited equally to 3 areas (first you fight in one planet, then inside a ship, and then again in another planet). A little bit of more effort from the producers of this videogame could have created more variety for you to be present in another scenarios/planets of the Clone Wars. But I believe this problem to be minor, when you compare to the much more positive aspects of the game.Still, I cannot recommend you buy it at full price (except if your are a Star Wars nerd :P), since it is an old game and it no longer has an active multiplayermode. Buy it only when it´s in promotion.Like many people claim, this game really needs a sequel - where you play as the same squad team, now part of the forces of the eeeeeeeevil Galactic Empire. It would have been a much better sequel to make instead of the disaster that was Star Wars ""BattleFront"" EA (THE GAME IS NOT WORTH OF DESERVING OF ""BATTELFRONT"" ON IT´S TITLE!!!). Unfortunatelly, this game appears to have been forgotten and I don´t think a sequel (or a reboot) will ever be created.7.5 out of 10 "

												Quite possibly the best Star Wars licenced game out there in my opinion. I have fond memories of playing this when I was 7 or 8 years old back in the day, and the game has not aged AT ALL. Smart squad commands, challenging enemies, a wide and interesting array of weapons and some of the best voicework in a game I have seen. Its not just a great star wars game, but its a great shooter as well. Highly RecommendedPros-Intuitive and innovative squad commands-Interesting weapons, like the Trandoshan projectile weapons and the DC15 system-Great AI, both enemy and teammates-Brutal difficulty even on normal-Wide array of enemy types, and you even get to see characters such as Yoda and General Grevious!Cons-Pretty short, clocked in about 6 hours-Buggy in some sections'-NO SEQUEL			"

												Still a great game, very happy to pick it up on sale as I never completed it back in the day.It CAN be run at 1080p, but you'll need to use a hex editor to change the aspect ratio to 16:9 and open up a .ini file with notepad (or your text editor of choice) to incease the resolution to 1920x1080.  It's VERY VERY easy to do this, but if you don't understand these basic terms and plan to ♥♥♥♥♥ endlessly about not having native 1080p in a 2005 game, you've only got yourself to blame.			"

												Star Wars: Republic CommandoThis is a Star Wars FPS that puts you in control of a squad of elite clones, better known as Delta Squad. Your squad members have different personalities. Funny, reckless, and serious. You have to complete campaigns, which can take quite a long time to complete. Your squad members have different abilities, one's good at explosives, one's good at computers, and one's good at sniping. You can assign them to do things. The shooting is like CoD, but the graphics are a bit outdated. I'd recommend this game, it's a good Star Wars FPS  game - possibly one of the best made. 9.5/10			"

												In this game, you are playing as the leader of a special clone commando, you won't see a jedi a single time. Reasoning behind that is to see the military side of the clone wars, not just the ""OP Jedi destroys everyone without any losses"" one. You have to be tactical, giving commands to your 3 fellow clones, to have all of them survive through the story. The basic idea is fascinating, although I don't believe it to have been done completely right. Whilst you certainly aren't overpowered against the enemy, I don't really see how this game is portraying the bad side of war, as clones are still beeing shown as the good ones, while their enemies are the bad guys, and you won't ever build up any feelings for any of the characters out there.However, the gameplay feels solid, and the tactical part of the game was enjoyable as well.The graphics are OK to play now-a-days, while some textures, like the ones of your three clone companions, have very high resolutions, other parts, for example the skyboxes, often highly lack in quality.If it is on sale for less than 5€ /5$, I would recommend you buying it specially as a Star Wars fan.2005 this would've probably easily gotten 9/10 points, 2016 I would rather give it a solid 7/10.

They can be anywhere doing anything and the story will always make sense as long as they dont fight or kill important characters to the rest of the universe. I love it.			"

												Star Wars Republic Commando, Knights of the Old Republic, and Battlefront 1 are considered the Holy Trinity of Star Wars games.  You can put Rogue Squadron in there as well, but these three are always the ones everyone always talks about.  Republic Commando is an FPS set during the period of the Clone Wars where you command an elite clone unit called Delta Squad.  As you travel throughout the galaxy and undergo missions you will be faced with very difficult challenges, very immersive gameplay, and a cast of characters you will never forget.  This is a no-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game.  It's hard, it's fun, and it leaves you begging for more.  I remember this game came out during the time of Halo 1 and after playing both I thought Republic Commando just kicked way much more♥♥♥♥♥  This is a game you must play if you're a Star Wars fan or an FPS fan.  You will be hooked right as soon as you give your squad that first ""BREACH THAT DOOR"" command.I'm giving this game a strong 9.5/10.			"

												One of the best Star Wars games I've ever played! Every aspect of this game feels really polished, creative, and researched (well, as much as you can for a sci-fi setting). It all comes together with the gameplay to make a really immersive and surprisingly original (since it's not just re-hashing something straight out of the movies) experience.First of all, the gameplay. After my first session of this game, I actually had a lot of complaints. The enemies feel like bullet sponges - often times taking entire clips just to down one. My squadmates stand out in the open in view of a strong enemy and stupidly march to their deaths without taking cover into consideration. The reticle for the main rifle is really wide and it doesn't feel ""precise"" like I would imagine a laser weapon would feel. Even when I have an enemy in the crosshairs a lot of shots go wide. However, after my second session these complaints disappeared as I got familiarity with the gameplay. You learn the importance of grenades for taking out the high-health enemies, the importance of ordering your troops around to specific ""maneuvers"", how to hit targets with all the different weapons, and how it doesn't matter that much if your squad does dumb stuff because you can still win encounters on your own. You start to understand the tactical tradeoffs of the different maneuvers and weapons. So, if you find yourself frustrated or a bit annoyed your first time playing, give it a rest for the day and come back tomorrow.You might notice the squad-based tactics and orders system. If you've played other games like that, you might be dreading having to deal with it, but I think that it's done very well in this game. It's really simple, and they do a great job of helping you keep track of what your squad is doing. There's a lot of subtle ways they achieve this and I won't describe them all. You won't really have to micro manage what everybody is doing using all sorts of different keys - you usually just press F2 so they follow you around, and then point at things in the environment and press ""f"" to tell a squad mate to perform a specific maneuver. Because it's implemented this way, it's pretty seamless as you switch between shooting and commanding your squad. Even if you go down, your squad can sometimes manage on their own and come revive you.Anyway, it's hard to be frustrated with this game because of the great quick save and quick load system. It's really fast and makes it so you never have to worry about replaying a section over and over. If you do find yourself at a  spot where you keep failing, there's usually a ""trick"" to the encounter to overcome that spot, accomplished by intelligently using the weapons and maneuvers available to you. It's a nice way to design a game like this - a lot of the encounters are kind of like puzzles, in a way.And all that is just about the gameplay. One of the best things about this game is the detail and the immersion it achieves. I highly recommend going into the sound settings and making sure you max them out if you can, and making sure to play with headphones with the volume high enough. There's all sorts of details in all the little sounds, the writing, the UI elements, the dialogue and one-off things the characters say that manages to not get too repetitive, and lots more that needs to be experienced to be understood.If you like Star Wars games, this is one of the best. Even without that, the game is a fun, squad-based sci-fi shooter. It's actually similar to Halo in a lot of ways, so if you like that game I bet you'd enjoy this.			"

												Ah, I love this game. I remember playing it when it was on the X-box, and was is great to play it again.It's a squad based action shooter, with rather intelligent AI companions (Although they can't use any weapons other than the main gun unless in special cover). You play through the game taking place during the Clone wars as a elite squad sent on special missions, and in my opinion it really nails that atmosphere of taking on the impossible odds, as your sent against increasingly difficult hoards of enemies. Keep it mind, it isn't an RPG, there are no real choices or decisions to be made, and there is no multiplayer scene, giving it unfortunately very little replayability other than for enjoyment. It is a fun game however, and offers some of what I feel is the best squad gameplay and teamwork mechanics even compared to newer games today. Worth picking up if you just want to shoot some baddies and lead a commando team.			"

You're the squad's leader, Delta 38. You have the ability to command your troops, whether it be to breach doors or take  up a sniping position. The game will take you to the following locations: Geonosis, an Acclamator-class assault ship, and Kashyyyk. Command your troops through each campaign to set charges, computer slice doors, set up sniping positions, and many more to effciently complete your mission.

												If you're a fan of FPS's and Star Wars, this is the game for you. It's great fun bossing around your fellow troopers, having a complicated battle strategy and it really makes you feel like you're operating your own team of commandos. However, it can get very boring at times, probably because I don't like single-player FPSs. After hours and hours of plowing down B1s with your assault and wasting several clips of sniper ammo on the B2s, it does lose its entertainment value and just becomes another FPS. However, it can still be fun if you play it correctly.			"

Tactics and fast thinking are  key. This game will bring you through many filled fire-fights and even some scary solo missions (Ghost ship scared the ♥♥♥♥ outta me when I was 7) This game brings you to 3 awesome Locations and you will mostly get you immersed in their atmosphere. This game is worth it			"

												Ah, I love this game. I remember playing it when it was on the X-box, and was is great to play it again.It's a squad based action shooter, with rather intelligent AI companions (Although they can't use any weapons other than the main gun unless in special cover). You play through the game taking place during the Clone wars as a elite squad sent on special missions, and in my opinion it really nails that atmosphere of taking on the impossible odds, as your sent against increasingly difficult hoards of enemies. Keep it mind, it isn't an RPG, there are no real choices or decisions to be made, and there is no multiplayer scene, giving it unfortunately very little replayability other than for enjoyment. It is a fun game however, and offers some of what I feel is the best squad gameplay and teamwork mechanics even compared to newer games today. Worth picking up if you just want to shoot some baddies and lead a commando team.			"

												Star Wars Republic Commando takes place during the Clone Wars and the game follows the story of Delta Squad, an elite unit of Clone Troopers tasked with special operations. You're the squad's leader, Delta 38. You have the ability to command your troops, whether it be to breach doors or take  up a sniping position. The game will take you to the following locations: Geonosis, an Acclamator-class assault ship, and Kashyyyk. Command your troops through each campaign to set charges, computer slice doors, set up sniping positions, and many more to effciently complete your mission. Multiplayer for this game is no longer provided.			"

												So I first played this game way back on the original XBOX like some odd 8/9 years ago. I was (math is hard) 9 or 10 then, and I thought the game was cool, but it wasn't ground breaking or life fulfilling. So I played it, beat it, and really didn't think about it too much.Time passed and now I'm 18. I saw this was on sale and I said to myself, ""Hey, I totally remember this game from way back when! I've got some spare pre-Christmas dough, so lets give it a go!"" Best 3 bucks I've spent in a while.  PRO   Obviously, amazing price tag. 3 bucks is basically less than a half hour's work at minimum wage.  Solid core gameplay mechanics. The A.I. is reaaaaly good for this time of development, and squad commands and actions are smooth and natural.  Atmospheric environments. Cliche, I know, but this game hits it home on the atmosphere. As a commando, you really get a Halo ODST feel to your character (really bada** but not Master Chief-invincible) (BTW I'm not comparing ODST to this game bc I know a lot of people feel strongly about the game but w/e ok back to main points). For example, on a specific mission you go onto a derelict, abandoned Republic destroyer to investigate why it went missing. As you enter the ship, you get overwhelmed with just how big the ship is. Your squad splits up to cover as much ground as possible, so you go alone into your section of the ship. It's got a nice Death Troopers feel to it (GREAT BOOK BTW).  AMAZING CHARACTERIZATION. So this one is really important to me. I feel like lately I have played waaaaayyy too many games that just throw in characters somewhat relevant to the storyline without actually giving half a crap about establishing who they are, where they come from and how they act. Sev, Fixer, and Scorch (your squadmates) all come from the same clone production facility and program, but they have DISTINCTLY different and memorable personalities. Sev is your deep voiced, hunt-loving, bada** sniper. Fixer is your narcissistic and protocol following technician. Scorch is your curious, optomistic, reckless explosive specialist. Seriously good work put in here. Oh yeah and they don't just tell you who they are at the beginning of the game and then treat them as generic clone troopers the rest. Their character traits and facets stick with you throughout. Streamlined HUD and squad commands. They put in basic controls for your squad (Attack formation, defensive formation, defend area, regroup) that just about anyone with a cheese brain can conquer. They also designated certain cover positions to be used for lobbing grenades, sniping, or AT weaponry, which is a nice touch and a boon to locking down an area. Also, your hud is like actually looking through a trooper's helmet. So that's +1 for atmosphere again.Diverse yet comprehensive inventory. Your sniper rifle, rocket launcher, and machine gun are all variants of your blaster rifle; it creates a professional feel about your loadout. You also have your handy-dandy blaster pistol, which is a good backup. Lastly, you're kitted with 3 different grenades (Thermal detonator, flashbang, and anti-mech EMPs. You can also pick up alien grenades too.). Added on to your traditional inventory, you can pick up elite weapons from dead enemies if they drop them. The hardest enemies to kill drop the best weapons to use. Dope.There's more I could touch on, but those are the basics. Cons would be a slight lack of content and game-time, lack of multiplayer/other gamemode, and sometimes buggy AI but I'm forgiving on that. All in all a great game. I can appreciate the theatrics and core mechanics of the game now more than I could back then, and by heavens I hope that someone someday comes out with a worthwhile sequel to this. If you're a fan of Star Wars, I would ABSOLUTELY reccomend this. The storyline covers some aspects the movies don't, and the ending is very satisfying to the total storyline of SW. If you're not a huge fan, I still reccomend. This game can be really difficult at times, but it's still a worthwhile FP shooter that should be tried out. If you absolutlely hate it, it's still only just 3 bucks (at least right now). 9.5/10 ayy lmao			"

												I remember when this game first came out and my dad purchased it on the original xbox. back then, I thought the game looked cool just because it was starwars. well fastfoward roughly 11 years into the future and during that timeframe, I had sadly forgotten about this gem. You see my console was a sony playstation 2 and this game was an xbox excusive when it came to home consoles. Well I caught a steam sale for the starwars collection and decided to purchase it because it had both 2 kotor games and battlefront 2. One day when I was scrolling through my library to find something to play, my mouse had landed on republic commando... The moment that main menu music started playing was like a flash of nostalgia. The memories of the cool starwars game were back but this time I was the one experiencing it firsthand.Few things about the game.The ai is fantastic, from having them man turrets to heal eachother and yourself (you'll need it) I found the ai to be some of the best i have ever experienced.Although this game is over a decade old, I still think it has some pretty fantastic graphics that definitly aged well (specially with settings maxed)The soundtrack is just amazing... that purfect pix of classic starwars tracks with remixes and new tracks made specifically for the game. no moment was ever a dull one.The difficulty is indeed harder then most other shooters (specially starwars ones). Dont go into this with a battlefront mindset at all or you will have a hard time.personally, I would drop current steam price on this game BUT if you find it on a sale, you owe it to yourself to add it to your library if you like starwars or good fps games.

												If you're a fan of FPS's and Star Wars, this is the game for you. It's great fun bossing around your fellow troopers, having a complicated battle strategy and it really makes you feel like you're operating your own team of commandos. However, it can get very boring at times, probably because I don't like single-player FPSs. After hours and hours of plowing down B1s with your assault and wasting several clips of sniper ammo on the B2s, it does lose its entertainment value and just becomes another FPS. However, it can still be fun if you play it correctly.			"

												This game feels like it should have been made in the 90s, when memorable characters and good stories came to games without question.It's an FPS where you lead a squad of clone soldiers - all who manage to have a distinct and enjoyable personality - as you tear around behind the curtains of the Star Wars universe.  You won't jumping from any rooftops in flashy lightsaber fights, but your crack team of mighty mortals finds their own way to be awesome.Squad controls are simple, too.  It reminds me of a more involved Mass Effect.  You can give general orders like fall back or take cover, but all throughout the level are little hot spots that a squade mate (or yourself) can take advantage of.  Lot of enemies in a room?  Get someone on the turret.  Just make sure you cover him on the way over there so he doesn't get shot (or you do it, and have your guys cover you).It's a surprisingly great game with a fun concept, delightful characters, and solid mechanics.  It's aged, but not so much that it's not worth $20.			"

												This is truly an amazing game. Take a step into the life of a clone commando, where you are responsible for the lives of your squad mates. This is one of the greatest Star Wars games of all time! Immerse yourself into the awe inspiring Star Wars World to command a clone squad, as their leader you must be responsible for their strategic actions and welfare. With the use of in-game techniques based on real Special Ops techniques, set up your squad in the best way possible to take down the CIS! In this expansion of the Star Wars universe, wield new, unique weaponry designed to fit the aliens that conceived them! This game is one of my all-time top favorites and I rate it at 10 out of 10! I have never come across such a distinctive game as this, both in story and gameplay! I recommend this to anyone who enjoys strategic gameplay, first person shooters, Star Wars, or well written story lines! ""Enemy eliminated, proceeding to next sector!""			"

												I wish there was a star rating for steam, because while Republic Commando is a good game, it has a lot of problems. Its singleplayer campaign is just too short, bordering the length of the original portal, and the finish is anticlimactic. You just start to connect with your AI squadmates when the campagin ends, and its kind of frustrating that they couldn't have added on another mission or two. On the positive side its a fun game with a lot of strategy and a decent enough plot, but I'd wait until it goes on sale before buying it. I also really enjoyed the mechanics for working with your AI squad mates, and I wish more FPSes did AI interaction as well as this title. All in all a good game, but with dated graphics and thats just too short.			"

												10 years ago, when this game originally was released, I got this game but the thing is... I never finished it. Why I don't know, can't really remember. Because of that, I was really happy to see ""Republic Commando"" as part of the 'Star Wars Humble Bundle' - I could finish what I started so long ago.Was it worth it? Both yes and no - mostly yes. The game is very simple in comparison of what we've got today, but it's still Star Wars and it has got some fun action throughout the game. It's a tactical first person shooter where the player is the commando of the Delta Squad and you have the ability to give the other three soldiers commands - ""Attack that enemy"", ""Snipe from that position"" and similar things.As I stated before, it got some good shooting but was pretty linear and monotone - the environments are pretty same-looking and the enemies are pretty much the same ones everywhere. I know, there's not much variety in the Star Wars movies either, but still... they could be somewhat creative.If you get a chance of getting this on the cheap, I'd say ""go for it""! Also, if you're a big Star Wars fan... go for it!			"

												If you love Star Wars, and you love a First Person Shooters, with an Awesome Storyline then this game is for you.I fell in love with this game when it was released back in 2005, and still 10 years later I still jump on and play some Republic Commando. This game is still an awesome game, and I Highly recommend it. Its  a squad based FPS,but what I love is that each of your squad mates has there own personallity and great Dialogue. Set in the Clone wars, you are taking up the role of a Clone Commando, its a different look at the Star wars Universe, through the eyes of a soldier, instead of a Jedi, which is what makes this game interesting This game never gets old, and is, in my opinion one of the best Star wars games out there, along with the Star Wars Battlefront II.There is however no more Multiplayer which is a bit of a shame, but still this game is worth buying for just the singleplayer alone, although the storyline isnt long, it still got that great Star wars feel to it, and you will be begging for more. There are an array of weapons, which is what you should expect from an FPS, weapons range from ones that the Commandos use, and then there are ones you can pick up from different cultures, from all you enemies.So even though this game is 10 years old if you are still considering buying it don't think twice, you wont regret it.10/10			"

												This game is amazing, It's has maybe textures of a game from 2005, but who cares.You play as a Clone Commander in the republic war and you have a squad of 3 other people.You don't simply walk around and shoot alien's and people, Like the: Follow-The-Objective and that's it like you would in MW2-3 or anything. but this make's you the bos of your squad, you can command them to go cover you/blow thing's up/hack consoles/snipe people down/stand clear/to follow you or to stay and more.and if you dislike commanding you squad to do it, you can also do it yourself.this game has basically a great story, somewhat funny dialoges, good gameplay, and amazing location's to go for mission, maybe it doesn't has a viarity of diffrent location's, but every map is a tough challange that you will enjoy playing.i played this game when i was a child, and even now i'm playing it. i reccomend this to every star war's lover or even if you just started liking Star Wars a bit.The sad part is this game is not so popular, but this game is damned amazing.1000/10Would keep this game for the rest of my life.

												If you love Star Wars, and you love a First Person Shooters, with an Awesome Storyline then this game is for you.I fell in love with this game when it was released back in 2005, and still 10 years later I still jump on and play some Republic Commando. This game is still an awesome game, and I Highly recommend it. Its  a squad based FPS,but what I love is that each of your squad mates has there own personallity and great Dialogue. Set in the Clone wars, you are taking up the role of a Clone Commando, its a different look at the Star wars Universe, through the eyes of a soldier, instead of a Jedi, which is what makes this game interesting This game never gets old, and is, in my opinion one of the best Star wars games out there, along with the Star Wars Battlefront II.There is however no more Multiplayer which is a bit of a shame, but still this game is worth buying for just the singleplayer alone, although the storyline isnt long, it still got that great Star wars feel to it, and you will be begging for more. There are an array of weapons, which is what you should expect from an FPS, weapons range from ones that the Commandos use, and then there are ones you can pick up from different cultures, from all you enemies.So even though this game is 10 years old if you are still considering buying it don't think twice, you wont regret it.10/10			"

												One of my favorite Star Wars games and favorite First Person Shooters in general, an excellent example of what the universe of the prequel trilogy can be when placed in the right hands.  The campaign mission doesn't exactly tell a compelling story (its 3 narrative arcs broken into smaller missions) and the gameplay can be repetitive, but the whole experience is solid thanks to the squad based combat.  It really feels like you have control over your squad, each combat situation ends up feeling like a puzzle you need to carefully strategize with team placement to solve.  I've beaten this 3 times since the original came out on the Xbox and I will probably play through again at some point, highly recommended, even if it isn't perfect.			"

												Released in March 22, 2005 this first person Star Wars game is probably the best thing about the prequel films. In this game you are 1 of many clones being trained to be Commando's of the Republic on Kamino. Basically the Republic Commandos are the Navy Seals of the Star wars universe. The game takes place during Episode 2: The Clone Wars and is supposed to bridge the gap between Ep2 and Ep3. I always found this game awesome because of the perspective. What I mean by that is that most star wars games always focus on the Jedi or you are this master sith lord or something that gives you an advantage over the others. While in this game it gives you a soldiers perspective of the Clone Wars, which was greatly overlooked during the films. You play as the leader of Delta Squad; a 4 man expertly trained group each with special abilities and skill sets. Sev is the Sniper, Fixer is the hacker, Scorch is the demolitions expert and you... well you are simply the Boss. Although the game emphasizes that each has special ability sets, anyone of your group can do the task you tell them todo. The game is one of the first games that I know of that puts you in control of AI. For example if you see a vantage point you can call out one of the commandos to snipe over there, or if you notice one member is low on health you may send them off to heal. This mechanic brings a variety of ways to play the game but also makes you actually feel like the leader of this squad. Each of the characters in my opinion each have their own personality that doesnt make them dull or boring and makes you want to care for them. The game starts you off on an assassination mission on Geonosis but then leads to other planets like Kashyyyk and broken down space carriers. I personally loved the campaign because you are only a soldier so alot of the time you are just as curious of the mission as they are. The game has great combat with a variety of weapons and a fair difficulty level that you can change at any time. The grittiness that this game brings to the star wars universe is awesome and is defiantly  a must play for any Star Wars fan that can find a original Xbox copy or buys it for $10 off Steam.OVERALL:This game is a great first person shooter that takes place in the star wars universe and should be played by anyone who enjoys that. Also the game has team deathmatch multiplayer so if you are into that sort of thing you should play now before the servers shut down!9/10			"

												First thing I can say about this game is that it is kinda hard playing it if you're used to call of duty or any other games that are like it because here your character is the leader of delta squad and you have to order your squad to tactical positions in order to eliminate the enemy. Although the AI is good ordering them to tactical positions makes killing the opponents easier. Other than that the game is awesome and the story line is great. THIS GAME ISN'T LIKE OTHER STAR WARS GAMES WHERE YOU'RE A JEDI OR CAN BE A JEDI. YOU'RE A CLONE COMMANDO NO FORCE POWERS OR LIGHT SABERS JUST GUNS GRENADES AND TACTICS. The graphics of this game is not that bad even though it was released a decade ago. I'd recommend this game for gamers who play FPS who want a bit more challenge and Star Wars fans.			"

												TLDR: I love this game above all others, and when you're done with it several times, I'm confident you will too.Again, not really good at writing reviews. I will however state that I absolutely love this game.Don't let the few hours clocked on Steam fool you. I only bought it on Steam because it's more convenient than using 2 very worn CDs.I've played the campaign at least a dozen times over the years. Sadly, the campaign is short, but in no way does the campaign length negatively impact the absolute quality of this game.Best squad-shooter I've ever played. Excellent voice acting. Squadmate lines are witty and charming, and the squad is extremely affable. There is no way you will not like all of them, though it is very likely that you'll have a favourite. Mine is Scorch :)And you will experience true loneliness when you and your squad split up on several occasions to achieve independent objectives.Again, I love this game above all others and I would recommend this game to anyone, anyday and everyday, Star Wars fan or otherwise.If you value exellent gameplay, simple yet elegant squad mechanics, amazing voice acting, witty one-liners, affable teammates, dark and immersive atmosphere, brilliant music and everything else that makes an excellent game excellent, you would be severely amiss to let this game go unplayed. And when you're done with it, play it again. And again.One play through hardly does the game justice as it impossible to get take notice of all the gems it offers with just one play through.Infinity/10.""Clone Advisor: Delta Squad, clear that promenade!Scorch: Promenade, sir?Fixer: Shut it, Six-Two.""

												Republic Commando owns. You're free to fight however you want, tactical or not tactical. Graphics are alright for the time. Music is pretty cool. It's set in the prequel era, so that part sucks. Story is pretty much prequel stuff that noone cares about. Unless you're up against bullet sponge mechs without any sniper ammo, the campaign moves along pretty quickly. Five or six hours. Ten dollars is worth it. I paid sixty when it first came out and loved it.			"

There are still some bugs where your teamate may fall of an edge of the world which can be a issue but will respawn after a checkpoint. I remember playing this game back on the original Xbox and it's just like I remember it. The controls are pretty smooth, no mouse issues, no screen tearing, and no game breaking bugs. ModDB has texture, mouse and ingame bug fixes which helps improve the experience as well.			"

												Star Wars Republic Commando is a First Person Shooter with a tactical twist, to control your squad! Not only does it deliver a solid and outstanding narrative, but it also proves that you can get a connection with characters through numbers. No pre-rendered cutscences needed!Shooting: The game can be tough, it really can. It is in no means easy and the guns have the right amount of star-wars and unique twist. There isn't the biggest array of weapons, and i often found myself sticking with the default commando weapon(s). Oddly enough, these space weapons also have a tiny bit of a recoil. No idea how that works, i just know that i enjoy shooting them.Controlling your squad: It's smooth, yes, but sometimes it doesn't really work because of the odd AI, your squadmates aren't always intelligent and they're often very slow. Luckily, it can be very useful to know where to put them, and once you've put them there, they'll stay there.(Unless you go down and they have to save you.). Overall, it needs a bit more depth, but it works a lot better than most games these days.Your squad: Delta are absolutely the coolest looking clone-commandos in the galaxy! They are familiar with each other and have some rather cool and talketive interactions. People like 07(Sev) is the badass sniper who's not very talketive with a gruff voice and well, a few twists. I don't remember the other characters that much, but that's because i haven't played the game in a while. The AI however isn't that well-developed and often clunky.Conclusion: Despite the lack of multiplayer (RIP gamespy), the weird AI and the short length of singleplayer. I encourage anyone to drop those 10 Euro's on this game. Because it really is worth it. Not only will you remember the game as something that ABSOLUTELY needs a sequel, but also one that needs to be more noticed. In short: The game is great. Seriously, if you haven't bought this game yet, i encourage you to buy it.			"

												This game is amazing. I've been playing this game for many years now. Been trying to finish campaign for many years. Never got past Geonosis. There is a legit rumor that EA will have a 3 minute trailer to the sequal Imperial Commanods this year at E3. The game will be realesed in November 2017. This game will always be one of my favorite games to play. Pros:Everything. Cons: Nothing.			"

												This my friends ... This is a game. *note* I have played this game no doubt 500hrs off steam.  There's so much action, drama, and story. Let's see what we got! Gameplay - This game runs extremely well, given that I kept my old pc machine with windows xp lol. The gun fights are super fun and the melee isn't hard at all. Moving around is easy, and i've had no issues with it, hasn't crashed at all.Graphics - Back in the day ( dang i'm getting old ) this was amazing to gaming standards. The realistic blood and gore, bodies jiggled around if you shot them, etc. To todays standards it's not graphically "" amazing "" but it looks a lot better than some games that came out 5yrs after it. Other - The story is pretty interesting. You're a squad of elite commando's trained and bred to be a one man army. You have Scorch (Delta 62) The classic goof off and jokster that loves blowing stuff up. He's made me chuckle more than once and keeps the squad in good spirits. Fixer (Delta 40) is the brains of the team, he can hack anything and is a loyal soldier that follows orders perfectly, and does everything by the book. Sev (Delta 07) well ... Sev is Sev. Tick him off and he will kill you. Seriously, he will. He's the hot headed one that's just misunderstood, and will do anything for his brothers. He's a weapons expert and loves to kill anything that stands in the squads way. The squad AI is just perfect. I look at other stupid AI's in games, and think to myself, "" Why can't all AI be as good as my squad?! "" They follow your orders perfectly, warn you of enemies, and if you die they will fight tooth and nail to revive you. You really bond with your family. Yes, family. These are your brothers, and you feel close to them ... This story will make you laugh, grit your teeth, and cry. I wholly recommend this game. They just don't make 'em like this anymore ... EA is making Star Wars Imperial Commando 2 - DON'T screw it up EA. Or i'll have your heads on a plate. 10/10 easily.			"

												As far as I've been able to play it, brilliant game!This game seems to be a lot better than I would've ever expected. It's great for Star Wars fans especially those whom love the Clone Wars. It's extremely fun to actually be commanding a squad rather than being the ""newest recruit"" in the squad. You're all brought up the same way and you all became part of a team together which really puts the equality between your team. The great thing about this is rather than viewing them by their rank, despite that they're all pretty much the same in this game anyway, you can view them by what they're specialized in.Another great thing about this game is that your character can actually talk! YES! You read this correctly! Unlike almost EVERY other FPS, your character can talk! And he talks as much as the rest of the squad which can lead to some really interesting conversations between the squad.However, as with every other game, there are some flaws. This game can be INCREDIBLY difficult which really puts people like me off of playing it. Because who wants to play the same mission 100 times just to move to the next, even harder, section of the mission. If you're someone who hates having to search up walkthroughs, good luck trying to complete this without going to YouTube. Another flaw that links in with this, normally games use hints for you to find out how to get around a certain enemy in this game. As much as I've focused on the surroundings, enemies AND dialogue, I haven't noticed any hints since Geonosis.To sum up, for someone who hates a lot of FPS games I really enjoy this and I will continue to play it... When I can be bothered to look up the walkthrough for the mission on the Acclamator-class Assualt ship.I rate this game:7/10			"

												If you like first person shooters and Star Wars, then you will enjoy this game. Simple but intuitive squad commands add depth to the FPS gameplay. The campaign mode doesn't take very long to finish, but it's fun and the commandos are well done characters. Each of them has personality and adds to the squad in a meaningful way. The game does have a multiplayer aspect, but I don't know much about it because I've never played it. Some technical notes; this game runs well on medium to high settings with integrated graphics. I'm running it on an Acer Aspire XC- 603G (a cheap Walmart PC given to me by a family member) and haven't had any issues on medium settings. I played this on the original Xbox back in 2006 and it's a better experience even on a low-end PC. 10/10 did purchase again.			"

												There is one outstanding game mechanic in SWRC, and that is that you can never really die. When you ""die"" you are really just incapacitated. And when you do, you have the ability to force the AI to come heal you or to make them follow current orders (btw, the menu looks awesome here).Republic Commando has another amazing game mechanic, and that is to be an utterly INANE, EXTREMELY GENERIC FIRST PERSON SHOOTER. There is absolutely nothing else in this game that makes RC stand out against other games. It's like the developers just gave up after making it Rainbow Six or any Tom Clancy game.That's not to say it's a terrible game...well..actually, come to think of it, it is pretty bad. The levels can be rather confusing and full of tedious objectives and enemies (many of which [I'm looking at you Super Battle Droid] have obscene amounts of health and take forever to die).See rest of review here: http://gamespotting.net/gameblog/review-star-wars-republic-commando/ "

												I bought this game on release and for years since I've always wanted to go back and play it again, but I could never remember why until I bought it again. Despite having to jump through numerous hoops in order to get it optimised for a modern operating system, Republic Commando is a surprisingly wonderful game given that it is, in many ways, a rather standard corridor shooter.Whilst genre-wise it may play as a rather standard FPS shooter, the writing of the characters and the missions gives a much greater depth to the world than it otherwise ought to have. You play the commander of a crack team of Republic commandos, and your teammates all have distinct and consistent personalities, and are autonomous enough to make them seem genuinely intelligent. Yes, you will be giving orders for the most part - and their AI is programmed well enough so as to feel like they're an extension of yourself, as they should - but you won't need to tell them to heal themselves, or attack the bad guys if a threat looms, and should you be overcome and you need help, they will be promptly at your side healing you at the risk of their own lives. And this all helps to develop a genuine bond with your fellow squadmates, particularly as the game is much easier when you have their help, further emphasising the importance of your cumulative strength as a team. On top of this, the missions, whilst comprising of many parts, manage to consistently escalate the stakes until by the end of the mission you feel a genuine and frantic rush of adrenaline as you plunge headlong into the final stages of each operation. And it's the little things that make a difference - for example, whereas most games would have an alert announcement indicating that your vessel will self-destruct, in this case they're serious. And it's these little things that actually make you emote as a player, which is what any experience should do, whether it's a book or a movie or a video game.  And thus, Republic Commando manages to rise above it's state and hold up quite well as a challenging and compelling experience. I'd recommend it to Star Wars fans primarily, although I think it has a wider appeal because of the quality of the writing.			"

												Star Wars Republic Commando is a really fun game. It provides an awesome experience in the Star Wars universe. It is also hard as nails. It feels like quite a challenge, which makes it seem like a much more realistic outlook on the Clone Wars. I definitely reccomend it, and if you get stuck, you can press the '@' key which opens the console, and type in 'TheMatulaakLives' (This puts you in god mode.) My one wish would be that it was possible to play the campaign co-op.But yeah, it's great.			"

												""Scavenger Drones"" (roughly translated to ""holy ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥why do I keep dying"") are hostile, and deadly, enemies encountered. They are about the size of a toaster, and hover 3 meters above the ground using AntGrav Hover™ technology. Upon seeing a Republic Commando, they will fire a constant beam at them. This beam has a 100% chance of hitting the commando, sometimes even if they are behind a wall. Once this beam is fired, the Commando has approximately 1.3 seconds to destroy the drone, or they will be killed. This is no easy task however, as the drones are small, fly incredibly fast, and have a 75% chance to dodge bullets. Also, they like to hunt in numbers, usually seeing about 3 or 4 of them in a pack. Why the man who designed these drones meant to siphon resources out of disabled ships thought it would be a good idea to make them kill people, I have no idea.			"

												It\'s Star Wars meets FPS plus Tactical team based gameplay. Your team can\'t die but they can go down and when that happened the fight gets harder. Loved the characters. Then again I read the books and I understood them that much more. Still would like to see a second one at some point in the future.			"

												This is one of the best FPS games i have ever played, and dont let the pictures fool you, the game has been updated but the store page has not. if this isnt the best FPS game ive ever played, then it is definetly the best single player fps game i have ever played; amazing story, amazing gameplay, and missions that are difficult enough that you dont beat it the first time for every single one. the only downside to this game is that like most other star wars games, the multiplayer was removed, and because of that i give it an 8/10. also, i took a look at all of the negative reviews, and all of them are either a) negative because the game crashes if you change the resolution; this was fixed in a recent update. b) negative because of other gameplay and lighting issues; these have either been fixed or the person just didn't have a good enough computer. c) because the mouse sensetivity on the startup screen is insanley high. this one i actually agree with, but its really not a good reason to give the game a bad review.

												Very easily one of my favorite shooters. It has a pretty good story (honestly, most star wars games should, the universe is set up to tell stories), easy controls (watch the mouse sensitivity), and wonderful gameplay. You will die, you will be frustrated, but you won't give up on it. The sound in this game is absolutely incredible (the geonosians' weapon sounds really interesting). Enemies are pretty balanced, most of the game I went around with a pistol throwing grenades, but I used A LOT of cover. Good luck, and cry because Sev. Good god, they need to make a game about rescuing Sev. That'd be beautiful. I'd buy 3.			"

												Republic Commando is a tactical first person shooter where you are the leader of a small squad called Delta Squad. The gameplay is much like any other shooter however instead of run and gun the player must order their squadmates to perform different functions such as slice a terminal, set a bomb and get behind cover and use various weapons including sniper, anti-armor and grenade. They will also target one enemy, form up on the player, go to a certain location or search and destroy. On top of that the player has a special weapon called the DC-17 which was interchangeable from assault rifle to sniper rifle to anti-armor launcher. The Player also had a full HUD that made it feel like the player was really in a clone trooper helmet.  One of the other cooler features is instead of dying you just go down and you can either call a squadmate over to revive you, maintain their orders and kill everything before getting you or just reload a save.  A lot of these features worked perfectly it isn’t like whoever could develop the sequel couldn’t just use all these features all over again. It begs the question where is the sequel if the gameplay mechanics are already there and ready to be used again. 	You are Delta RC-1138 or “Boss,” the leader of Delta squad who has in it RC-1262, “Scorch,” the comedic relief /explosives expert, RC-1140, “Fixer,” the by the book soldier that specializes in slicing and RC-1207, “Sev,” the hunter/sniper. You start out in your birthing tube on Kamino and it shows your training as you age. Eventually your squad meets up for the invasion of Geonosis during the beginning of the clone wars. There Delta Squad is tasked to infiltrate and assassinate Sun Fac, a Geonosian leader. Along with that they have several other objectives that they accomplish including destroying an underground droid factory and retrieving launch codes from a Trade Federation core ship. 	One year after the invasion of Geonosis Delta Squad is set to investigate their original ship the Prosecutor to find out why it has not responded in several weeks. During this they find out the Trandoshan Slaves and Mercenaries have taken over the ship with the help of the Separatists in order to capture and bring the ship back to a Separatist base. Delta Squad ends up destroying all of the Trandoshans and defends the ship from a Trade Federation Battleship that attacks shortly after. 	The final mission involves Delta Squad being the advance recon team on Kashyyyk and to help the Wookiees to fight back the Trandoshan Slavers and Separatists that have control of the planet. They end up rescuing General Tarfful and run into General Grievous themselves but only end up fighting those IG-100 Magna Guards that carry the Electrostaff. Eventually Delta Squad makes it to where the Separatist Battleship has linked itself the giant citadel tree and they destroy it. They end the game on a cliffhanger as Sev had been captured and the invasion of Kashyyyk by the main republic force had begun which once again begs the question, why not continue the story and have a sequel. 	Now the graphics aren’t anything to write home about but they are fairly impressive for when this game was made, 2005, but what really makes this game look impressive is the HUD for the clone troopers and the art assets they created for the game. Lucasarts did not separate themselves from canon too much in that the story of Delta Squad lines up perfectly with that of the actual Star Wars universe and Extended Universe. 	Republic Commando is actually the first Star Wars game that featured licensed music that included the song “Clones” by the band Ash which sounds awesome. On top of that they included all of the heavy battle music from John Williams you may have heard from any of the other Star Wars movies. The voice acting is also superb as for most of the clone troopers and Delta 38 was voiced by the original actor for Jango Fett, Temuera Morrison which I thought was a nice touch.  	Overall this game is actually one of my favorite Star Wars games of all time and is an absolute classic in terms of story and gameplay. With the disbandment of Lucasarts, in order to make a sequel some developer is going to have to get rights to both the Star Wars IP and the Republic Commando IP which could make it quite pricey. •	Story  - 4 out of 5•	Gameplay – 4 out of 5•	Graphics – 4 out of 5•	Sound  - 5 out of 5•	Fun – 5 out of 5Pros: -	Fun gameplay/squad commanding-	Great music and voice acting-	Star Wars UniverseCons:-	Can get annoyingly difficult with the lack of ammo at times-	Repetitive enemies I’m giving a Total score of 90% "

Chaos has erupted throughout the galaxy. As leader of an elite squad of Republic Commandos, your mission is to infiltrate, dominate, and ultimately, annihilate the enemy. Your squad will follow your orders and your lead, working together as a team - instinctively, intelligently, instantly. You are their leader. They are your weapon.  - Highly Recommended!			"

												GLANCE RECOMMENDATION: 83% YES / 17% NOGOODGreat clone wars commando troops and squadAll 3 squad mates have their own flavor, but aren't exclusive to their speciality (e.g. the demolitions guy isn't the only guy that can undergo demolitions tasks, but he's just faster at them I think)Guns are fun, with your main gun having 3 variations (rapid fire, sniper, anti armor) with a fifth slot for alien guns and a surprisingly superb melee attacklots of chances to use squad tactics and assess sitations to make better calls. you can direct which cover to use and enemies to focus on.squad functions feel fun to use (ordering squad mates around and changing tactics)NEUTRALGraphics are fine. Kind of plain and you fight the same enemies for large chunks of time, but they make good use of it.BADStory is fine overall and closes out at a steady pace, but ends abruptly at a point you feel like more came after.SUMMARYOverall they really nailed the tight squad combat and made the combat fun. I'd be very interested to see this get another entry.			"

												Let me just start off with: if you LOVED Star Wars Battlefront II, then you will LOVE this game!The gameplay is almost exactly the same with the addition of command over 3 other commandos. You have a wide variety of orders to give.Pros--Gameplay--Story--ZERO bugsCons--Difficult at timesThe only things that were annoying were that your teammates died rather quickly, and there was an overpowered enemy called the Super Battle Droid. Those of you who are Star Wars fans know what this is. But if you're not a Star Wars fan, I have two words of advice:1. Become one.2. Try this game out for sure.Thanks for reading this review!			"

												-Reposting since 32 fanboys can't understand that MISSING SOFTWARE is an issue with a game and SHOULD BE TOLD TO THOSE THAT HAVEN'T BOUGHT THE GAME YET. Fun Fact: ""Yes"" that makes the review helpful, even if its not an issue for your preferences. It might be for people that are not you. That is a major reason to have reviews and read them. NOT THE ORIGINAL CONTROLLER COMPATIBLE!?! /RAGE QUIT. Understand, I Love This Game, it is a great game but they sell a crippled version of it. This was originally an (Microsoft) Xbox game and to not have an obvious (Microsoft) controller option is stupid. Yes; Xpadder.com provides a ""work around"" (you just have to build the button layout profile yourself)... But not everybody wants to buy a copy of the Xpadder program, or one like it. If these control setings are not an issue for you, do buy this FPS. (Fun Fact: Linking a patch to play a great game is helpful. You might even find someone that needs it one day.)Lore/TLDR = I bought this game on Xbox when it came out. It's 'like' the first Halo only you get great AI teammates and the gore is /shiver the first few times blood splatters your face. I loved it. I've even read all 5 of the Republic (and Imperial) Commando books by Karen Traviss. So this game was one of my first purchases (main reason I bought the complete Star Wars pack) and I was going to play this with a huge nostalgic grin. But my Xbox one controller is not an option, only mouse and keyboard. I had to calm down just to find a work around via google. Took about 15 mins to instal and learn how to use the Xpadder program. It works very well for a button jury-rig. I'll even be enjoying GW2 with it. Conclusion = For a gamer like me controls are everything; this controller issue only effects users like me and this obvious lazy move by the development team is the worst thing I can say about the game. (Or might just be more of Microsoft's quiet war against Steam. Illuminati confirmed.) Which means this is still one of my favorite games, but I'm going to leave this as a negative review as a warning to others that this is NOT THE ORIGINAL plug and play control settings.			"

												Listen to the others- This is a great game. I am about to finish the game right now even though it only says I have a few hours. (I had no wifi at one point so I played offline.) At school when I mentioned 'Star Wars' some of my friends questioned  me except one, (the one who showed me this game) and I explained that this isn't a six year old Jedi v. Darth Vader game. It has a very unique, fun play style. You play as a Commando of 'Delta Squad' with a funny, helpful team. I breezed through it because I'm not new to conserving ammo and first-person shooters. (It's helpful to use the pistol a lot.) Though, at some parts, especially when locking up the Republic ship, it was hard. But I'll have to give this game five stars because of the great gameplay and amount of fun put into a game that reminds me of my childhood.			"

It makes me sad to see this game but know its greatness is not appreciated by many. I wish lucasarts would try to advertise this game better or at least make a commandos 2 to say, ""hey look at the greatness you idiots missed, buy it and have a taste of this real star wars strategy fps hardcore fast paced scary as hell at points game!""

												This game is amazing. I've been playing it ever since it came out on the Original Xbox, and I maybe have 1000+ hours into it. My childhood summers were defined by this game. And not because it's a great tactical shooter, that has an amazing soldier atmosphere and command system, but because it's fun. The story is full of humor, darkness, and original Star Wars themes. The multiplayer is solid, with no problems I can think of. I remember shooting my neighbour off the multiplayer maps and absolutely breaking the game :) If you like Star Wars, or the Clones of Star Wars, this is an amazing game for you. If you like tactical shooters, this is also a game for you. Just freakin' buy it.			"

												Even the game had no reason to be good, the developers have certainly surprised me with a refreshing Star Wars game, nice gameplay mechanics and good story driven action elements. If you have some free hours at hand, and a little bit of money, certainly pick this game up. 7/10			"

												It's bloody, gritty and rather tricky. A Star Wars game for a more mature demographic with likable characters with, albeit cliched, personalities. You got your rough and tumble borderline serial killer 07 - SevYou got the fun and dumb but highly trained demolitionist 62 - ScorchYou got the bottom feeding, intellegent and downright square 40 - FixerThen there's you, the quick thinking leader of Delta Squad - 38 - BossThey may have differing personalities and prefernces but at the end of the day each sqaud member is very copy and paste in terms of usefulness and each one gets the job regardless of what they prefer to do which is good, why leave a Commando half cooked?The gameplay aspect was astounding. The Ai are intellegent (bar some hiccups) and follow orders very well. You say 'Search and Destory' they'll take point and peek around corners before engaging the enemy.Say 'Group Up' and, well, they come to you like a Jack Russel that heard a bag open.Give the order to 'Secure Location' and they actually dig in, taking cover behind objects and not leaving that spot unless you put them on a position but even if one goes the other two stay and keep digging in, its great if you need to heal at a bacta station under heaby fire.Lastly there's the 'Move On' command which ends whatever action the commando's are doing and will either fall back to a secured location if a marker was placed or come back to you.In battle you HAVE to be the leader. These guys wont do more than cover and shoot unless you point them towards a turret, sniper location or explosive ordinance spot. There's nothing finer than having all three squad mates on useful points as you go against a small army of droids. There are also non-combat meneuvers like Slicing a terminal, setting a detonator charge or Breaching and Clearing a room. Your surroundings are as much of a weapon as anything though, one part I liked was when I had my squad distract a heavily armoured spider droid while I snuck around the back, sliced a terminal and dropped a crate on its head.Droids also have this annoying habit of being extremely hard to kill. Maybe the battle droids are easy but Super Battle Droids, Destroyer Droids and Spider Droids are tough and require you to focus the entire squads fire on one at a time. There are other enemy types but I wont spoil it.All in all this is a fun game but with a sadly abrupt ending. It almost felt like they ran out of funding halfway through and ended it at the worst moment possible. I literally felt like someone came into my bedroom and pulled the blug on my PC, that was how abrupt the ending blackout was.All in all you can get some 15-16 hours out of it which isn't too bad. It's a good game with solid FPS mechanics and some great voice acting where it counts and despite its abruptness the ending was fairly good and will leave you wanting more.9/10 solid gameplay with very very few glitches but with an abrupt ending			"

												I loved and hated this game. It felt long because the gameplay felt repetitive and long after awhile. The gameplay is pretty much run and gun. The squad is frustrating at times because they aren't too smart and will stand there at times while people are shooting at them. The graphics are kind of old school. The game is good for Star Wars diehards but for the average FPS gamer its something that gets long to play as the game progresses. I felt myself wanting the game to end really early in the game because of how repetitive it got. The great thing about this game was the soundtrack, it was very well done. The online portion of the game is small but still active. The online portion is the thing to play if you want a fun experience with it. The story of the game was confusing and left you wondering. The really annoying thing about this game was the ammo and guns, if felt like you ran out of ammo too fast. Get it if you love Star Wars, but not if your looking for a good story and gameplay.			"

												There is alot of things this game does right and alot of things this game does wrong. The gameplay was done right, You really do have to instruct your team correctly and expirement with different methods of attack to win this game, run and gun alone will not cut it. the story was all over the place, it had some epic moments but there was alot of bland parts repeatitive tasks. the soundtrack was decent but it sounded like it was trying to hard to rip off halo. And your squad mates were majorly interchangable, they can all do the same tasks and don't have near enough dialogue to make you really feel differently or tell any real difference between them personality wise, but to be fair they are clones. the AI was was average,  most of the enemies just stood still and occasionally changed attacks that they used but ther were some mobile enemies that did chase and follow you, only to get knifed in the face. overall it's a good game, but i suggest playing it in segments/parts, dont play the whole thing at once or your gunna get real burnt out.

												Listen to the others- This is a great game. I am about to finish the game right now even though it only says I have a few hours. (I had no wifi at one point so I played offline.) At school when I mentioned 'Star Wars' some of my friends questioned  me except one, (the one who showed me this game) and I explained that this isn't a six year old Jedi v. Darth Vader game. It has a very unique, fun play style. You play as a Commando of 'Delta Squad' with a funny, helpful team. I breezed through it because I'm not new to conserving ammo and first-person shooters. (It's helpful to use the pistol a lot.) Though, at some parts, especially when locking up the Republic ship, it was hard. But I'll have to give this game five stars because of the great gameplay and amount of fun put into a game that reminds me of my childhood.			"

It makes me sad to see this game but know its greatness is not appreciated by many. I wish lucasarts would try to advertise this game better or at least make a commandos 2 to say, ""hey look at the greatness you idiots missed, buy it and have a taste of this real star wars strategy fps hardcore fast paced scary as hell at points game!""

												This game is amazing. I've been playing it ever since it came out on the Original Xbox, and I maybe have 1000+ hours into it. My childhood summers were defined by this game. And not because it's a great tactical shooter, that has an amazing soldier atmosphere and command system, but because it's fun. The story is full of humor, darkness, and original Star Wars themes. The multiplayer is solid, with no problems I can think of. I remember shooting my neighbour off the multiplayer maps and absolutely breaking the game :) If you like Star Wars, or the Clones of Star Wars, this is an amazing game for you. If you like tactical shooters, this is also a game for you. Just freakin' buy it.			"

												Ah yes this game. A gritty Star Wars FPS playing the role of a Republic Commando taking control of a small squad to complete various tasks in the name of the Republic. This game was quite the blast to play.First off the combat is fun and engaging with various weapons and a few unique ones too. You also have a squad to command and you can order them to various tasks such as arming explosives, taking sniping positions and so forth. The music holy hell isn't it beautiful? Especially at the title screen. One of my favourite parts about this game is the amount of detail put into this. You can see your helmet on the wholeway through and when enemy blood splatters on it, it gets wiped away. There are some other cool little things I won't spoil. Not to mention the game looks good in general.I've played both the PC and Xbox version and I would recommend the PC version. It has better controls overall but the Xbox version is an impressive feat in itself. This was one of the last Star Wars games in the Golden Age of Star Wars games before there was silence but things are looking a little bright now. This game gets an 8/10.			"

												One of the best Star Wars games ever. Very immersive, pretty good graphics for a 2005 game, excellent voice acting and levels, good story, squad tactics. I just can't find anything bad about this game. It's pretty hard too, which is a good thing. Sometimes you will litterally have to re-load your save like 10 times to finish a level, which is good for gamers who like a bit of challenge (hard FPS are so rare these days). Overall an excellent first person shooter set in the star wars universe. You should definitely play it.			"

												This is absolutely amazing. The only bad thing about it, is that the game is too short, I want more, much more. They managed to do awesome Star Wars game without jedis and lightsabers. Commanding elite squad of clone troopers and shooting Trandoshans and droid is incredibly addicting. Why they didnt make sequel? I want one badly.			"

												It's bloody, gritty and rather tricky. A Star Wars game for a more mature demographic with likable characters with, albeit cliched, personalities. You got your rough and tumble borderline serial killer 07 - SevYou got the fun and dumb but highly trained demolitionist 62 - ScorchYou got the bottom feeding, intellegent and downright square 40 - FixerThen there's you, the quick thinking leader of Delta Squad - 38 - BossThey may have differing personalities and prefernces but at the end of the day each sqaud member is very copy and paste in terms of usefulness and each one gets the job regardless of what they prefer to do which is good, why leave a Commando half cooked?The gameplay aspect was astounding. The Ai are intellegent (bar some hiccups) and follow orders very well. You say 'Search and Destory' they'll take point and peek around corners before engaging the enemy.Say 'Group Up' and, well, they come to you like a Jack Russel that heard a bag open.Give the order to 'Secure Location' and they actually dig in, taking cover behind objects and not leaving that spot unless you put them on a position but even if one goes the other two stay and keep digging in, its great if you need to heal at a bacta station under heaby fire.Lastly there's the 'Move On' command which ends whatever action the commando's are doing and will either fall back to a secured location if a marker was placed or come back to you.In battle you HAVE to be the leader. These guys wont do more than cover and shoot unless you point them towards a turret, sniper location or explosive ordinance spot. There's nothing finer than having all three squad mates on useful points as you go against a small army of droids. There are also non-combat meneuvers like Slicing a terminal, setting a detonator charge or Breaching and Clearing a room. Your surroundings are as much of a weapon as anything though, one part I liked was when I had my squad distract a heavily armoured spider droid while I snuck around the back, sliced a terminal and dropped a crate on its head.Droids also have this annoying habit of being extremely hard to kill. Maybe the battle droids are easy but Super Battle Droids, Destroyer Droids and Spider Droids are tough and require you to focus the entire squads fire on one at a time. There are other enemy types but I wont spoil it.All in all this is a fun game but with a sadly abrupt ending. It almost felt like they ran out of funding halfway through and ended it at the worst moment possible. I literally felt like someone came into my bedroom and pulled the blug on my PC, that was how abrupt the ending blackout was.All in all you can get some 15-16 hours out of it which isn't too bad. It's a good game with solid FPS mechanics and some great voice acting where it counts and despite its abruptness the ending was fairly good and will leave you wanting more.9/10 solid gameplay with very very few glitches but with an abrupt ending			"

												Listen to the others- This is a great game. I am about to finish the game right now even though it only says I have a few hours. (I had no wifi at one point so I played offline.) At school when I mentioned 'Star Wars' some of my friends questioned  me except one, (the one who showed me this game) and I explained that this isn't a six year old Jedi v. Darth Vader game. It has a very unique, fun play style. You play as a Commando of 'Delta Squad' with a funny, helpful team. I breezed through it because I'm not new to conserving ammo and first-person shooters. (It's helpful to use the pistol a lot.) Though, at some parts, especially when locking up the Republic ship, it was hard. But I'll have to give this game five stars because of the great gameplay and amount of fun put into a game that reminds me of my childhood.			"

												This game is up there with Metroid Prime and Unreal as being one of my favorite FPSes ever, plus one of my favorite Star Wars games. I just wish it was longer.Unlike most FPSes I've played, where the combat's attempt at a frantic pace just makes it an annoying mess of white noise, Republic Commando's squad-based gameplay forces you constantly calculate battlefield tactics as opposed to just trying not to get shot.The game's biggest weakness comes in a few brief segments where you're forced into a tactical situation by yourself, where one stray bullet can drop you; or when you're given a time limit, which in one case resulted in me finishing a level with literally a second or two left on the clock. The intensity of the firefights makes completing your objectives in time an incredible strain.Besides that, the game is only three missions: Geonosis, a deralict Republic battlecruiser, and Kashyyyk. Thankfully, each of these missions will last you a good three hours a piece, so I wasn't left feeling like I'd played an unfinished game. I was, however, left wanting a lot more. In particular, the notion of this game's encounters playing out organically, with nonlinear level design (and a lot more levels), sounds like the workings of one of the greatest FPSes ever.			"

												I have played 2 hours and 30 minutes of this game so far, and I AM LOVING IT. The game has you play as a Clone Commando, designated ""Delta 38"". Your squad (Also named ""Delta"") are also highly trained clone commandos. The graphics aren't terrible (in fact, I kinda like them) despite the fact that this game is pretty old. It took me a while to get used to the controls, as mouse 3 is Aim, not right click (which is grenade).  Gameplay is VERY solid, and FUN. Its starts out easy, but quickly gets DIFFICULT, even on the normal mode.  And in the beginning, when you dont know how to counter the enemies, it can take anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes to destroy new enemies, such as Super Battle Droids. But that is quickly remedied when you have the tools and experience.  The AI is actually REALLY good, as in, unlike games like Call of Duty, the friendly AI can actually shoot and kill things. This is really helful, especially when there is many or tough enemies. Also, since we're on friendly AI characters, I LOVE THEM. All your fellow Commandos, despite being clones, are very human so far. They have different personalities, and in the short time I knew them, I started caring about my ""brothers"".  Although there are some Friendly Fire incidents (both me and my squad's fault) I felt like this made them even more ""human"" (probably due to the ammount of friendly fire that happens in other games like Arma or Insurgency). You can also give your team orders, which I find to be promptly followed and well executed, which has been a huge assist. So in conclusion, I will list what Ive found;-Solid shooter gameplay-Nice, easy, and fun squad based mechanics-Many different enemies in the campaign-Human like characters (For me anyway)-ACTUALLY HELPFUL TEAM AI (very important)-Very Very Fun.-graphics are still alright (depending on your tolerance to old graphics)The few bad things I have found are:-Enemies sometimes bug and dont move or shoot-Allies sometimes get stuck on a position, making them take a while to execute the order.-old graphics			"

												I Personally love clones in the star wars movies. It turns out, I'm more prone to ""bad guys"", but this game changed my feeling of bad guys. This game puts you in a squad of clones unlike any other!Pros- Bots are quite useful- Able to control the bots into what you want to do (ex. heal, revive, kill, Ect.)- Wide range of weaponry- Many objectives that can possibly overwhelm you!!!Cons- The gameplay can get quite repetitive- You and bots can easily die very quickly- Bots take orders very slowly- Terrible multiplayer system (No-one plays that anymore!)This is my input in the game. It's your decision if you want the game. Hope this helped!			"

												It`s a good and fun game, but it`s not a complex tactical shooter in the Star Wars universe I was hoping for. The gameplay is painfully linear and there`s very little tactial depth to it. You can`t give commands to individual soldiers, sniping positions are fixed and cannot be assigned by the player, and door breaching has no additional options (like throwing in grenades or something). Rainbow six - Vegas has actually more depth and tactics than this and that`s saying something :( The levels in this game are very restrictive (You follow a hallway with some rooms). Another giant weakness is setting the game within the prequel trilogy, so you`ll be killing a lot of droids in stead of strom troopers/rebels. The main protagonist uses a Codename outbreak style multi purpose rifle which can be adapted to many different weapon types, which is kind of a letdown. The guns in this game seem to be a little underpowered not doing as much damage as You would like them to do. Iwas generally dissatisfied with this title but for a sci-fi action fan, who likes tactical elements and doesn`t hate the SW prequels- it might be good shooter.			"

												This game is a great game, It shows that LucasArts cares for his games, plus all the other companies that helped. From all the Starwars Games, I say this one is a great success I've played all the games. This is my top favorite it's got, okay graphics, and some basic game settings that make it better, but that's not the point it's about the campaign this has a great campaign and a great combat system. I've beaten this game 3 times. Though what is shameful about the game is that the campaign is not that long it's about a 4-6 Hour Campaign. Though at the end.... I would suggest getting this game. It is indeed a Classic!			"

												One of the best games I have ever played when I was younger and once I saw it on Steam I just had to get it. It's not as fun as I remember but still fun. Wish they still had the multiplayer but oh well I can live with just the campaign. The question that everyone is asking and I am as well is, WHERE THE HELL IS THE SEQUEL!?			"

												When I played this on Xbox as a kid, I thought it was the best star wars shooter I'd ever played. Clone troopers always intrigued me more than the Jedi. Now I realize that, even on hardest, this game is too easy and too short. However, the tactical gameplay is no joke, and I personally perfer the squad control in Republic Commando over most Tom Clancy offerings. Multiplayer is a joke, but only because it's tacked on. If you have any interest in playing an awsome scifi shooter (and don't mind the low difficulty), I recomend this.			"

												Pros:-The voice acting is good-The music is great-The story's decent-The game's challenging-Enemies are varied-The tactical portion of the gameplay is well executed, for the most part-The DC-17m(default primary weapon) is badassNitpicks:-Using bumpmapping on high will most likely cause issues(can be fixed with a mod, but installing it will render you unable to play online with anyone who doesn't have the mod)-No widescreen support(can be fixed)-Some enemies are really cheap -The graphics show their ageCons:-The DC-17m feels weak, in its base form-Multiplayer's an afterthought-The sights on the DC-17m are hard to use-The crosshair makes hipfiring awkward-The friendly AI isn't too great, and tends to fail against higher-tier enemiesThis game is pretty much Star Wars and Rainbow Six: Vegas crammed into one game.  It's fun, albeit annoying, sometimes.  The game doesn't look like much, by today's standards, but it's good for its time.  If you're a Star Wars fan, or are into shooters, I think you should check this out.			"

												For a game that was made after battlefront 2 its very pleasent to play. If you like commanding a squad but also want the taste of the action this games for you. with 3 clones helping you navigate through levels and wanting to tell them what to do. Multiplayer LAN is a bit of a pain because you cant command them because they want there fredom to kill that guy instead of taking a sniper bunker. however playing alone and since A.I. doesnt understand what fredom is, you can tell them to do whatever the game is possible and they are pretty obidient like they listen to all orders you give them.and since there A.I players they try make the player compitent because its youre game and there lazy to make A.I usfullthis game is why i trust robots. they do so with no questions asked and GAME SPY (oh god i still want to enjoy this game with friends but how can i if you decied to shut down and lucas didnt trust oh i dunno THEMSELVES TO MAKE SERVERS)this is daud and i would like alot of star wars games if theres a way to crank back the multiplayer but this game is perferd to be played alone with A.I players                                                                                                                        9/10			"

												Ce jeu a été une excellente surprise. - Les graphismes ne font pas trop vieux (l'univers visuel de Star Wars aide)- On gère une escoudade et ça c'est génial. On peut enfin donner des ordres à ses coéquipiers! C'est ce qui me manquait à Space Marines! Choisir le couvert (sniper, démolition, grenade), qui va poser la charge explosive, pirater le terminal. Tenir la position, avancer de façon agressive, rester en formation, prendre une tourelle etc.! Il faut gérer son personnage et les trois autres, et ça donne une dimension géniale au jeu! - L'histoire est courte mais très sympa. On voit comment la République ne repose pas QUE sur les jedis. Et la fin... manly tears, bro.A acheter. Je regrette de ne pas y avoir joué avant les votes Steam pour le jeu devant avoir une suite.			"

												It's very rare for a game to age as well as Republic Commando has. The graphics, though visibly dated, aren't distractingly bad, and rather more importantly the squad AI is still some of the best I've seen in a video game. Quite honestly I wouldn't mind exchanging most of the people I play vermintide with for fixer, scorch and sev.			"

												Star Wars: Republic Commando is perhaps the greatest singleplayer FPS ever. Despite looking a bit aged, it runs well and is still as fun as ever. You play as Delta-38 (Boss), as the leader of Delta Squad, consisting of your explosives specialist and joker Delta-62 (Scorch), your levelheaded computer specialist Delta-40 (Fixer) and resident sniper/psychopath Delta-07 (Sev). You travel between three levels: the desert planet Geonosis, the start of the Clone Wars, the RAS Prosecutor, a derelict Republic Assault Ship (Ex Machina y u do dis to me) and Kashyyyk, home of the Wookies.The game is particularly notable for its advanced squad AI, which hasn't really been matched since. Your squadmates are easily capable of holding their own for a while, but the perfect balance is struck between the need for player input and AI competence. You also have the ability to command your troops to perform actions such as snipe enemies, hack terminals and man turrets.In conclusion, Republic Commando is a must-buy for any Star Wars or FPS fan.10/10 would use AT-TE again.

The graphics, though visibly dated, aren't distractingly bad, and rather more importantly the squad AI is still some of the best I've seen in a video game.

												This is one of the best star wars games made hands down.One the graphics look like great even for a xbox orginal game, I would say if I didnt play this as a kid that it was a early xbox 360 game.Second it's AI is very smart for its age, and you have to work with you 're team.Otherwise you 're dead easy.Third the story is very good never a dull moment. Wide varity of combat zones that give options to do in every fire fight, sending squad to snipe, use gun placements,anti armour,med stations which you will need and other tactical advantages and objectives. The game does not feel like a normal ""Star Wars game"" as in it forces you to think tactical and punishes you for not doing so.That all beig said Starwars Republic Comando is a great game for starwars fans young, old and new. It is a 10/10 in my book even years later.			"

												A squad based FPS set in the Star Wars universe with you taking on the roll of RC-1138 aka Boss. It's split up into 3 arcs and spawned a 4 part book series that's rather enthralling and I highly recommend as much as this game. It's a game that took on a really unique way of doing things that makes it hard for you to 1 man army and your squad is highly effective if given the right orders. It was designed with a controller in mind but forces KB/M which, when gotten used to, can function quite well. It's also got a really great music score and memorable characters.			"

												This is an FPS Star Wars game that puts you in the role of a clone commando soldier. It has a bit of a darker, more realistic tone but still keeps very faithful to the Star Wars licence.

												I absolutely love this game! It shows how awesome the Clone Commandos are and is great because there are absolutely no Jedi! I'd like to say real quickly that if you want this game and are leery because it says 'blood and gore,' don't be worried. There is a little blood, but not much (most of it is green alien blood); and the 'gore' is nothing to worry about. There is also just a bit of language as well. The campaigns are great! I love the weaponry options in the game, and the commands you give the Commandos are easy to use and understand. For being an 11-year-old game, IT IS FREAKIN' AWESOME! Last note about the game: The multiplayer does not work because the company that hosts the server shut down a few years ago.			"

												Star Wars Republic Commando is a Squad-Based FPS. that means you can't ""Rambo"" through this game. The single player puts you in the boots of the leader of Delta Squad, a squad of Clone Commandoes. You can tell your squad waht to do... YES. The Single player is difficult (Like most 6th gen FPS's) and can get FRUSTRATING at times. when you die you dont go back to your last save like most FPS's, when you die, you have to wait till your squad can revive you, you will go back to your last checkpoint if you whole squad dies. you are responsible for the lives of your squad mates, that means when bacta despensers are around, you need to tell your troops to ""Stop loafing around, and get some bacta"". the campaign is nice and long, unlike Call Of Duty's 4 hour campaign. The weapons are good, you start with a Pistol, that does jack♥♥♥♥♥♥in terms of damage, then you have the Blaser rifle, that the standard full auto rifle. then there the sniper rifle that is good, i guess. the anti-armor thingy is AWESOME, high damage, can DESTROY groups of enemys. then we have alien guns, the ACP is a trandoshan smg, nothing special, the array gun is this games shotgun. my favorite gun! and the trandoshan minigun and railgun are AMAZING guns as well! 2 wookie guns, bowcaster and the wookie rocket luancher. Now about that ending... UHG... The ending SUCKS. (SPOILERS) so, you destroy a ship, you have to leave behinde delta 08, and yoda says, ""The battle has begun"" and you say 'Lock and load deltas!"". Credits, WTF. The multiplayer feels like a lackluster Halo clone, not that fun. And the servers are closed do to the GameSpy shutdown. i recommend this game on its single player, and i would love to see a Republic Commando II. 8/10			"

												I think this game is AWESOME for any age! if you do not want your kids playing halo, cod,ETC. this game is PERFECT!very easy to learn for people who have played pc games before.this game is a EXTREMELY good fps game! great graphics(for a game that came out 10 years ago but still really good!)decent AI and best of all......BEATING THE TAR OUT OF STUFF WITH YOUR GUNS.ok enough with that lets get back to age...yes there is a good amount of blood  BUT this only happens when you kill them close or melee style (knife or hitting em with your pistol,BUT the blood is SOOOOO unrealilistic! its blue purple and orange but its goes on your helment but your helment cleans it very fast.BUT i am not saying let very little kids play this game, it might lead them to asking you if they can get halo gta cod, even though this game is WAYYYYYY below those games  graphic/inapproiote nis. in this game you DO NOT kill PEOPLE you kill droids and geonisions(alien things)this game is very fun and all ages can play and you gamers out there who like M rated games more then games like this this one is still a MUST BUY it is for adults and kids but kinda for 10-11 i think because it looks eye to eye on kids who are going through the stage when they cant play M rated games and dont want to play lego games.If you like shooters and you like star wars and you likes first person shooters this is a MUST BUY if you like first person shooters this game is a MUST BUY if you like video games this a MUST BUY because it puts EVERY SINGLE ELMENT of a video game into this one!all in all,buy this ten dollar game and i GURANTEE you will think it was the best ten dollars you have ever spent! thank you for your time of reading this review and click on the helpful icon below if this helped you!

												One of the best star wars games that isnt to do with lightsabers and OP Jedi. Despite being an old it is still good to play with a good story line and good game play. I mean they even got Temuera Morrison to do the voice acting which many games do not do and use terrible covers instead.			"

												I think this game is AWESOME for any age! if you do not want your kids playing halo, cod,ETC. this game is PERFECT!very easy to learn for people who have played pc games before.this game is a EXTREMELY good fps game! great graphics(for a game that came out 10 years ago but still really good!)decent AI and best of all......BEATING THE TAR OUT OF STUFF WITH YOUR GUNS.ok enough with that lets get back to age...yes there is a good amount of blood  BUT this only happens when you kill them close or melee style (knife or hitting em with your pistol,BUT the blood is SOOOOO unrealilistic! its blue purple and orange but its goes on your helment but your helment cleans it very fast.BUT i am not saying let very little kids play this game, it might lead them to asking you if they can get halo gta cod, even though this game is WAYYYYYY below those games  graphic/inapproiote nis. in this game you DO NOT kill PEOPLE you kill droids and geonisions(alien things)this game is very fun and all ages can play and you gamers out there who like M rated games more then games like this this one is still a MUST BUY it is for adults and kids but kinda for 10-11 i think because it looks eye to eye on kids who are going through the stage when they cant play M rated games and dont want to play lego games.If you like shooters and you like star wars and you likes first person shooters this is a MUST BUY if you like first person shooters this game is a MUST BUY if you like video games this a MUST BUY because it puts EVERY SINGLE ELMENT of a video game into this one!all in all,buy this ten dollar game and i GURANTEE you will think it was the best ten dollars you have ever spent! thank you for your time of reading this review and click on the helpful icon below if this helped you!

												If looking for a Star Wars game that takes place in the clone war era, this is the game for you. You get see the fight from a clone's eye view, instead of running around in a robe with a 3 feet glow stick. Great character desgin and persona. Use a crappy pistol which is only good to shoot rats and roaches. 8.5/10, would definitely to others to play.p.s.execute order66			"

												In my opinion this is the most misjudged game in history. Maybe it was just unlucky, but it is atmospheric, very dynamic, cinematic, captivating. A bit too easy though and quite short, but it has a very interesting Call of Duty like multiplayer, that is not as silly as in CoD. Buy it by all means. Great game. And also it's graphics looks cool even in 2011!			"

												NOTE: These are my views of the game, not generally a review, but may help.What can be said about Star Wars: Republic Commando that hasn't already been said? It's just simply awesome, it may be a game from 2005 but it is a game that is as ageless as it is priceless. My playing hours on this has only recorded a fraction of the time I played as I got it previously a couple of years ago off Steam and played through it and then again offline after I got it here.I'm a fan of the novels, and this just brings the characters you meet there, namely Delta Squad, to life. 11/10 for sure. Though I speak from a fans perspective, I also say this because the game has great dialogue, iconic characters, and a great amount of action and story that made a mark on the hearts of everyone who played this. A great game.			"

												Despite being extremely dated and naturally having trouble with modern machines, this game is perhaps one of the greatest Star Wars games. It has a narrow focus, features no Jedi, depicts a highly professional and futuristic space marine unit before it was cool, has a psychotic version of Kaidan Alenko, a short but sweet story, and allows you to blast many a clanker and gearhead on the backdrop of excellent remixes of The Droid Invasion and Palaptine's Theme, or the occasional Mandalorian battle chant, written before they became Karen Traviss's pets.And, luckily, Delta Squad survives the recent ""canon reset"".

												Pay no attention to the year of release, this game holds up remarkably well.  A single player squad based shooter that is also very fast paced is a rare find, and the game play is definitely fun.  You get to issue commands to 3 AI teammates who can hold their own quite well.  The banter is also pretty entertaining to listen to. Also, very rarely will you see your companions do stupid things.  We all know games where ai is more a hindrance then a benefit, and this is not one of those by any means.  You could just ignore squad commands most of the time, but telling a member to hole up in a sniper position will make them very much more effective.It's a great game, that just happens to take place in the star wars universe.  Which is a very, very good thing if your a fan. If you are a fan of star wars don't even hesitate as this game is well worth your time.  If you don't care much for the franchise the game play is still very much worth a playthrough.  I highly recommend this game!			"

												Now before someone tears my head off for giving a negative review let me explain...I only recently played the game and so I have no nostalgia factor for this review at all but I have heard quite a few good things about it so I was excited when I saw it on the christmas sale.Pros:+StarWars+Team AI is for the most part competent+Soundtrack+Good Characters+Team Banter+Visor Effects (Blood and NightVision)Other:+/- Decent Gameplay-Mouse sensitivity in the menus is crazy but is okay in-game+Older game that works without jumping through hoops for Windows 10Cons:-Extremely short campaign 3 main missions that take roughly two hours a piece on the medium difficulty-Not really a unique story it's just you leading delta through three different missions with no plot to speak of-Ends abruptly after a BS cliffhanger-Only makes use of three different environments (Geonosis, Acclamator, Kashyyk)-Lack of variety in every way-No replay value-Graphics are downright ugly in some areas (Clones Especially look terrible)-The multiplayer has been shutdown-Hasn't aged wellOverall:Republic Commando feels like a concept that wasn't fully realized in this game. Throughout my playthrough I kept waiting hoping for that awesome moment that honestly never really came. It's not that the game is bad it's just that it feels kinda meh by the time you finish it which is really disappointing to me for a game I heard so much about. If you're into star wars you'll enjoy the game there's no doubt about that but if you haven't played some of the other games like kotor or the jedi knight series those games give you more for your money.TLDR; 5/10 Average game with a short shelf life dwarfed by similar titles like rainbow six or other starwars games.

												Republic Commando has one of the greatest plots of all the Star Wars games, I even dare to say it comes close to the Jedi Knight games.You play as Clone Commando 39, which everyone calls Boss but because of the role he plays in the story i call him Player, you have three AI buddies, 7 or sev, 40 or fixer and 62 or Scorch.One thing that i wish this game had was 4 player co-op because at times the AI feels a little dumb, especially on the core ship on geonosis and the acclameter cruser Prosecutor which you have a time limit, yes an actual time limit after which the whole squad dies.The guns are interesting, you have a pistol similar to the blaster in Quake 2 and 4 with few differences, instead of charging up the pistol for more damage and having unlimited ammo the pistol has a small charge which recharges even while the pistol is holstered, your DC-17 blaster which has two other attachments, sniper and anti armour. Enemies don't drop ammo for your main weapons so you must rely on ammo pickups scattered throughout the levels, although each ammo pickup completely fills your ammo for the gun it's designed for.In addition to your DC-17 blaster rifle and DC-15 blaster pistol you can carry one extra weapon which is especially useful when they introduce Trandoshans because you can use their weapons, these weapons are the beam weapons that the Geonosian Elites use, a wookie bowcaster which charges up like the bowcaster in the Jedi Knight games only instead of firing like a shotgun it fires a stronger shot, also you can reload it, although this isn't the only wookie weapon because this time arround they have a rocket launcher too. Trandos have three weapons that you can use: a repeater, a heavy repeater and for the first time in a star-wars game, an actual shotgun.Enemies are fun to take down especially the Super Battle Droids, Droidekas and Dwarf Spider Droids. Magna Gaurds are also make an appearance, but aswell as their electro-stalf they have two dumbfire missiles, and so do the DSDS that appear in Republic Commando.There are squad actions scattered throughout the level, from the generic door breaches to the odd objective, although there are places that you can order your AI buddies to set up and these are the only time they change their weapons.Aswell as all these guns you also have four grenade types: aswell as the the standard thermal detonators we've been using since the early Dark Forces/Jedi Knight games you have a stun grenade, an EMP grenade and a sticky prox mine although watch where you place them because they have a wide detection range and they will explode if anything gets too close, even you or your squaddies, like your weapons EMP grenades, stun grenades and sticky bombs don't get dropped by enemies but thermal detonators do, although these only give you about 3 TDs.Multiplayer is UT with a Star-Wars twist with a tiny bit of Halo (unfortunitly) there are four gamemodes, Deatmatch, TDM, CTF and Assault which are pretty much identical to their UT counterparts, unlike in UT and main the campaign you can only carry two guns, but you start off with the DC-15 pistol and DC-17 blaster.In general if you get this game you should only get it for the campaign because while UT is a good game that kind of multiplayer just doesn't fit here.

												It's a very short and linear squad-based shooter. It's really unpolished and takes some work to get running. It's not exactly a bad game, but it's very technically limited and there's a lot of shooters that pull off this concept with more depth. I'd say only check it out if you really love Star Wars.			"

												""Let's be like Halo"" said every first person shooter developer of the early 2000's. Recharging shields protecting a non-recharging health meter, all weapons are fired from the hip with no form of aiming besides a centralized targetting reticle, got your melee attack that's always at the ready, easy-to-use grenades that are always at the ready, linear paths to objectives that take you through numerous firefights along the way, and you watch all of this from behind a combat visor.Fortunately for Republic Commando, I love Halo. Plus, RC tends to add some nifty features to the mix, such as the tactical aspect of commanding your squad (although the main tactic seems to be ""tell squad to snipe, step away from keyboard""). It also does a pretty good job of giving the characters personalities. They seem real, as opposed to just monotonous drones like Halo marines. Well worth the cheap price, and if you want to play multiplayer even now that GameSpy is dead, you can get GameRanger.			"

												This game was amazing back in the day. It's pretty much unplayable, now. Like many others, I've installed a few fixes from other players, but it's still glitchy. The cursor in the menu moves 1/4 of the screen when the mouse moves 1/16th of an inch on the lowest DPI setting. In game, the cursor is much slower, but it's ""jumpy"" (for lack of a better word) to where the game started giving me a headache after only 5-10 minutes.Some have said it's modern hardware plaguing the game, but I've played FarCry and a few others from the same or older time period without any of this craziness.Would I recommend Republic Commando? YES. Fantastic game.Would I recommend Republic Commando as sold on Steam? NO. Not unless you are willing to really sink time into getting it to work.By the way, I had to play the game in windowed mode, because every time I tried full screen, the game crashed. Personally, I'm going to put more time into making it work because I know it's an amazing game, but I would NOT recommend this to just any casual gamer due to the glitches.			"

												I bought the game because I really liked it when I played back in the day. I pirated the game before, like, four times and played it through, so it's only fair that I pay for it so I'm sending some well deserved cash to the developers. BUT, for whatever reason, when I play it on Steam it has a bunch of graphical problems! I decided to go for a refund, and if I ever feel like playing it again, I'm gonna pirate the game again. Seriously, impossible to play like this. Can't play full screen, the window has to stay in a weird resolition so the game won't crash the whole PC, and the mouse sentivity is even worse than before (it's always been an issue with this game). Very dissapointing. I was really excited about finally buying it.			"

												I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this one. I had a few bugs getting the game to work without crashing early, the menu mouse was always jerky, and time has really worn away any of the charm these maps once had. Every hallway feels the same on each planet in my playthrough, especially the second act.And while you might see a ""tactical"" adjective thrown around there, it's really not any different from a point-and-click adventure game. The vantage points all light up and there's never any real question about who or when you'll fill them.			"

												So I like this game and all cause I played it before but whenever I open this it just crashes immediatly. Maybe I'm the only one with this problem, as I don't see any other steam reviews complaining about the game crashing. The not recommended rating is just because of this problem. It's still a great game otherwise. "

												Miserable port.I remember first playing this on the Xbox.  It was pretty good when I played it.  So, when the steam sale came along, I decided to buy it for 3 bucks.  Big mistake.  The game is hardly compatible with Windows or Steam with 0 controller support.  The controls and aiming are horrendous, the mouse is hyper sensitive, so whenever you go into the menu, it is extremely hard to maneuver with your mouse because moving your mouse about 1/2 cm will go from one side of the screen to the other side.I don't know what happened to the graphics but as I remember it, it was no where near this bad.  I think there is no way to adjust the resolution nor the graphics, even though it says you can, it all looks like 800x600 resolution with the lowest setting of graphics. "

												This game looks terrific from their steam page but three problems are left out. 1) Game Length - This game is very short for a single player shooter. It is about 6 hours and features ""four"" locations. Kamino is a intro cutscene, Geonosis, An abandoned Reublic Starship and Kashyyyk (Home of the Wookies). This game features no multiplayer so it is really short.2) Story - It is boring, the characters are generic clones, I can't remember if the game had a plot but i am pretty sure you are just sent on three different missions and thats it. 3) Gameplay/Shooting - For a 6 Hour Campaign  this game is boring gameplay wise aswell. Their are a lack of enemy types and guns to choose from. I do NOT understand why this game gets so much praise. If you want a bland Star Wars Shooter go play EA and DICE's Star Wars Battlefront, at least that game also looks good.			"

												DAGNABBIT STEAM STOP SELLING INCOMPATIBLE BROKEN GAMES PLEASE.Bought this game with high hopes because of the many people that recommended it to me, but it seems I couldn't get it to run properly even after multipele fixes people provided across the net. It has to do with our newer graphics cards and a ton of reading was involved.First it crashes on startup and the mouse is crazy fast, so you download fan-provided fixes and apply them. Now the game runs pretty smoothly, but there are still a lot of visual bugs. Light effects just being red blotches, animations skipping and many enviroment textures morphed or strecthed out still made it near unplayable. So you try it in compatibility mode, but then it asks for a CD. And since none of the no-CD 'cracks' seem to work with the steam version I'm at a complete loss.It would be nice if there was at least SOME type of warining Valve could provide for games like these, thankfully we at least have the option to aks for arefund now.

												This game can be fun at times, but several of the game-mechanics are just outrageous, and they are bad enough to ruin the game experience for me. Fair enough, it is an old game and the people who bought this game when it came out probably had a lot of fun with it. But for someone who are adapted to the modern game marked and has a higher standard for game-quality, I would not recommend this. The graphics are what you can expect from the time it was made and it runs fairly decent. But again, some of the game-mechanics are in dire need of tuning and it suffers from a quite common problem with certain levels being just ridiculously hard to complete. You as a player are constantly being stacked against near impossible odds (which is of course where some of the charm of the game comes from), and there is a notable lack of creative solutions to solve a situation. Outrageous game-mechanics, unnecessary hard levels and a general lack of creativity: these issues alone are what caused me to create this review.However, if you are a Star Wars fan, this game does feature some quite interesting elements. The story is something for itself and you get a more personal look at some of the overlooked elements in the Star Wars universe.			"

												I bought this game thinking I could just load it up and play but I was completely wrong. None of the recent reviews for this game or the top reviews mention you have edit ini files to get the game working correctly. The mouse sensitivity is extremely high and there is no support for 1920x1080p so you will have to stretch the resolution by editing the ini files. I understand this is a 10 year old game but I don't believe in editing Ini files to get a game to work properly, that being said I can't recommend this game. Sadly, no one who bought this game mentioned these problems.			"

												Pros:-good soundtrack-short-action packed-challengingCons:-short (6-7 hours)-all 3 levels are the same-repetitous gameplay-unsatisfying gunplay-shallow gameplay-extremely annoying enemy typesConclusion:  I really wanted to like Republic Commando as it was one of the games from when I was a kid that I saw in a magazine but never got to play.  Unfortunately, it's a rather weak fps with squad mechanics.  The environments are bland, ALL of the guns feel weak, and the gameplay was extremely repititous throughout the 3 levels.  The only place where the devs changed it up was by throwing in a turret section at the very end.  The guns felt so weak that I ended up just melee attacking every enemy.  There are 5-6 enemy types and some get very frustrating to fight near the end.  There were some redeeming factors such as how they took the visor/helmet mechanics from Metroid Prime (fog, blood dripping down the front, etc).  Overall the campaign was extremely short and unsatisfying and because the official multiplayer is down, I can't factor that in to my opinion of this title.     5.5/10			"

												I have not completed the single player part of the game yet, but from what i have seen up now, it is a linear shooter with fairly simple objectives, extremely repetitive as it is go shoot this and that, investigate this or that while shooting these enemies and those enemies, every 10 meters there is at least a healing point or three depending on the amount of enemies and how hard your squad is hit. considering the year it was made, the graphics are pretty good and some low res textures in some places. the polygon models for a number of the races seen, especially the noisy carpets on that forest planet of theirs could of done with a going over once more.Would i recommend this? not really due to how repetitive the game is. if it had some form additional change of pace or puzzles or something like that, it could potentially be a little better. This is right up there with the original Farcry, you can try play stealthy, but in reality you are better off just blundering into yet another fight where stealth means little.Would of thought such a technologically advanced faction would of had the idea to build some silencers and scopes you can use for head shots. anyway, there is actually nothing wrong with the game for the most part, it is just as stated, a bit repetitive.Edit: After completing the single player part, the story was left hanging after what happened at the end, so it somewhat feels only half complete.

												This game's idea of more difficult enemies is just giving a lot of health to the same boring minions you've already been killing by the hundreds. Most FPS games are railroaded, but they [hopefully] disguise it well. This one doesn't. There are very few open areas to experience combat in. It's just choke point after choke point after choke point after...you get the idea. I will say that your squadmates are wonderfully voiced and really enjoyable in general. Other than that though, this game has just about nothing else good about it.			"

												Just like with Call of Duty; World at War, every time I tried to play this damn game something happens and I’m unable to. Either computers blowing up or me lacking the interest to go through with it, I always stop. Well, I got this game on a gigantic Star Wars pack a good time ago and I finally went through it, to finally see what it has to offer. And as usual, I’m gonna talk first about what it does worst, then move up from there.First and foremost, the story. They had a perfect opportunity to fill parts the movies didn’t really show about these damn iconic troopers. And what did they do? Waste it. Sure, you get to fight on the Geonosis raid on the first stage, but you never get to see anything else from the movies, no Samuel L. Mace Windu Jackson decapitating mandalorians or anything. And up from there, it’s just a few set pieces that are quite disappointing. I MEAN COME ON, I WAS SERIOUSLY HOPING TO GET TO SHOOT OBI WAN AFTER THE ORDER 66, BUT THE GAME NEVER GOES ANYWHERE! Second, the weapons are… Meh. The initial idea is actually quite f#cking interesting, a swiss-knife kind of deal, your weird gun is actually a ton of different kinds of guns. I liked that! However it barely does anything original with that, the guns are the most uninspired cr#p you can think: generic spamming rifle, generic 1-headshot-kill sniper rifle, generic OP-Grenade launcher… And the worst part is that you can pick alien weapons and add them to your arsenal, which sounds cool until you notice how BAD they are at everything! I WAS HOPING SO MUCH THAT THE SHOTGUN COULD MAKE THE GAME FUN, BUT IT’S JUST THE WORST AGAINST DROIDS! AT POINT-BLANK RANGE! YOU DO MORE DAMAGE BY PUNCHING THEM!Third, the squad mechanics. I personally think this game was ahead of it’s time on a bad way, this game SERIOUSLY NEEDED COOP. If it had, you would have Star Wars Left 4 Dead. However with just single player and a dead multiplayer mode (that kinda sucked anyway), it’s not so fun because their AI is as dead as progress with Half-Life 3. Giving them orders is cool at first, then you’ll notice how it never brings much new from what you see on the first 10 minutes of the game. It also doesn’t help that they’re stupid.The PC version is also a weird port made in the deepest areas of hell. Some of the stuff the devs thought were okay for PCs make me want to look for them and shove my computer up their #ss.Lastly, the stages themselves. I’ve already said that there’s not much to the story, right? Well, the stages are also quite small. And when I say small, I really mean small. What engine does this game use? Did they really have so many limitations? Every 2-4 minutes there’s another loading screen, and those 2-4 minutes were mostly just struggling to advance a large corridor. The game also barely has different themes going for it. There’s the initial Geonosis level. There’s an abandoned ship in space. There’s the Wookie planet. Another ship. And that’s it.So, does the game actually have good stuff going for itself? Kinda. At times…The characters themselves on your squad are not so bad. Sure they’re clichéd as all hell but I rather have 4 clichéd well written characters than a billion bad ones (LOOKING AT YOU, JAR JAR). Also the squad mechanics are cool when they’re first shown.The music and sound department is quite good, truly feels like taking out from Attack of the Clones, which helps feel better about the rest of the poor game.The enemies are also quite nice. They never truly feel broken, and are actually entertaining to fight against… Excluding the classic moments when HORDES OF UNLIMITED DROIDS ARE SWARMING YOU AND THERE’S LITERALLY NOWHERE TO HIDE FROM THAT CR#P.Personally, this is disappointing. No wonder there was never a sequel, it doesn’t feel properly finished. Do I recommend it? Save yourself the disappointment, and ignore it. I don’t really think it’s worth paying money for this. I was happier thinking that back then I was just half-way through the game and it actually could get interesting, playing through it to the end today made me see that I was 2 loading screens away from a really disappointing ending. TL;DR Edition: A great idea gone down to hell and back thanks to both a bad PC port and feeling empty and unfinished. The story is short and will make you feel like committing space-sudoku. If you don’t get it for free, I can’t really recommend this. Coop could’ve saved the game, sadly it’s mainly single player with a dead multiplayer option.			"

												This reviews probably won't count for alot of people because I'm personally not much of a Star Wars fan.The game had interesting conscepts and I never played it when it was first released way back when so I think I missed out when this game was top of the line.The sound in this game is pretty badass, the music is great and the dialog between your squadmates is cleaver in giving them well rounded personalities.The graphics vary throughout the game in my opinion, the first are you start in looked like crap to me with terrible textures and bland empty areas, but when you're inside of ships or helping out the wookies there's more design put into the levels it seems so it actually gets better thoughout the game.The AI annoyed the hell out of me, you need to tell them to do every little thing, if you leave them alone during a fight for even a few seconds they'll find the worst cover possible like under a turret or in the line of fire of a super battle droid and get utterly destroyed. This ends up being a chain reaction sometimes since you other squadmates will then run to the downed person and try to revive them getting shredded by the same damage that started the problem in the first place. They continuously walked in front of my fire, a few times they walked in front of me just as I was tossing a grenade so it bounced back and took most of my health.The guns are probably the worst part for me, you get a pistol, assault rifle, sniper, anti armor rocket, and a special weapon. But the reticles for them are just horrible. The assault rifle is the worst just being a huge circle that you fire pretty much on the right side of. The ammo caps for the weapons are really low too, making it so you spend some of the game swimming in ammo you can't even pick up, and then other parts in the game completely tapped out for long stretches of time (Except for the worst gun for the situation like the energy shotgun special weapon in a long range encounter). There isn't that many enemy types, just bugs, droids, and lizards. The main issue is that droids like the droidika and the super battle droid are largely bullet sponges, which in itself wouldn't be bad in order to toss a little bit of a need to focus fire in the mix, but towards the end of the game they send droves of super battle droids at you, and given how much ammo you waste on them I actually found it easier to just grenade them as a distraction then circle strafe around them and melee them to death (A ridiculous tactic that really breaks the seriousness of everything but it saves on ammo and actually resulted in me getting shot less).Pros:Great soundtrackSquad dialog is pretty entertainingWookies (They're huge and pretty viscious but they tend to just run into fire and die)Cons:Graphics are datedAIGunsWaves of bullet sponge enemies as you go furtherBuggy (Tell squadmates to take up snipe positions and watch them target things out of their line of site, or not switch to the sniper and proceed to try and hit long range targets with terrible accruacy weapons. Had a few get stuck in some place and stop following me.)I doubt they changed much since this game came out so if you liked it then you'd like it now. I just wasn't the correct audience for this particular game and it got pretty dull towards the end.			"

												If you are one of the people who are considering buying this game because of positive comments you've read online and are not a Star Wars fanboy... then read on.(Actually I was a real big fan of Star Wars when I was a kid. I think Dark Forces (1994) is more fun than this game)I bought this after reading all the ""Best FPS ever"" comments.The Steam version wouldn't load on my computer and after logging in to GOG I saw similar comments; ""Best FPS..."" blah blah so I paid 10 bucks for it and downloaded the Graphics Mod to enable 16:9 ratio and fix a lot of bugs. Took the warning about mouse-speed to heart. Read about the Full-screen anti-aliasing crashes the game and set the resolution to 4K instead of using FSAA. Read about the compatibility issues and inability to use EAX. Proceeded to open the game. And it actually loaded.Played for a while, and immediately got the feeling of a generic, dated FPS set in a Lucas Arts / Star Wars Universe... far away in some Hollywood Studio in the 2000s.Gameplay is excruciatingly simple. The enemy droids miss 90% of the time. Gameplay is strictly linear, running along narrow corridors and areas. One direction, no alternatives as far as I could see. (Played 2 hours on GOG version)And then there is the ""amazing"" tactics that everyone whimpers about. Well the ""amazing"" in this game consists of one button .. no I'm serious. There is a Use Button. If you want to blow up something blocking your way, (you'll know if you can because a big icon will appear on the object) you aim at it and press Use. The 'demolitions' expert automatically jumps forward and starts doing his stuff.You want to 'heal' your team-mate? No problem. Aim at a health 'bacta' tank thing and press, you guess it! USE.The game so far is beyond monotony. I'm glad I got it to play in 4K at 16:9 with bump-mapping because I'd have been angrier about this ""Best FPS ever"" (rolls eyes) if I had to play it as is available with the default installer: forced 4:3 ratio. A choice of resolutions I haven't remembered since DOOM 2 and QUAKE. i.e. 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768. Crashes. Glitches.*sigh*End opinion? This is definitely, by far, NOT the best FPS ever.You can pick up a really good game for the price of this. Games like Insurgency, or heck.. even Crysis was on sale for a couple bucks and that game is a much better game than this rubbish. "

												A game that I loved as a teenager, but just feels dated today. It's an early example of what ""console port"" used to mean - sloppy controls, low-skill gunplay, linear environments, bland appearance. Remember, this game came out in 2005, a year after Half-life 2, and contemporary with Battlefield 2, and CoD 2.But what really stuck in my young mind was the teamplay, the ability to order three commandos around and manuever into (and out of) sticky situations. My distant memory had been very positive, on par with Brothers in Arms or Ghost Recon. Sadly, that isn't really the case. The commands you can give are limited by the environment - you can say ""use that turret"" or ""take cover there"", but are otherwise unable to command your people. More often than not trying to get them to ""hold that area"" will result in them standing with no cover, clustered on a single point. The levels are the definition of linear gameplay, with absolutely no deviation from the script available.I feel bad giving this a negative review from a modern perspective. The game was actually rather daring for it's age, and deserved the praise it received. But I'm not reviewing it in 2005, it's ten years later and the game simply hasn't held up, and i wouldn't recommend it as a way to spend time.			"

												So when I was a Senior in High School I had a friend absolutely raving about this game. Now a decade later I finally play the game. I'll let the graphics slide because it's based on what the Xbox 1 could handle at the time. That being said Halo looked better. Second off everything about the gameplay is terrible. Just terrible. It's based on setting up bombs, waiting, then blowing it up. Rinse and repeat. Gunplay you unload 1k bullets on the thing and it finally blows up. Most of the time I just stood in place shooting at stuff. It feels like the hit detection is off and hit chance on you is a system of RNG. The story is sorta neat but it follows a story that really is made for 8yr old kids and is really not crucial because it's based on behind the scenes of Lucas Clone Wars. The music is from the film which is good but repeats over and over. The ending looks like Lucas told them to release it now and they had no choice by meeting the deadline or maybe they wanted to be edgy and made a huge cliffhanger. Regardless people complain about this game needing a sequel. I paid about $3-$5 for this game and I gotta say ordering a Big Mac from McDonalds is more enjoyable.			"

												This game has its moments of fun, but the overall story, the fact you only visit three worlds (2 if you don't count the space ship, and even then those two we have seen in games/movies so they feel redundant) and sadly the characters dont lend much to these Commandos. While I will admit I had fun during some missions, and some of the guns are really cool to use, the game feels rushed. What could of been so much more is so much little. The final mission is a complete joke and what starts off as great becomes average and what is average then just becomes well there. By all means, if you are looking for something short and love the Clone Troopers go right ahead. However for those hoping for something huge and expansive and amazing....well play Star Wars: Empire at War, KOTOR, or the Jedi Knight/Academy games. You will get much more bang for your buck.			"

												You really have to enjoy dry squad shooters to like this one. I found the environments to be very dull. Visually, it's below par for a Star Wars game. I don't mean in technical terms but in terms of color, textures, lighting and level design. As for difficulty, it has a certain combination that I really hate in games. Most of the time, the game holds your hand and tells you where to go and then crushes you with punishingly difficult timer missions. The more difficult missions are less about skill or decision making and more about playing it over and over to ensure you do everything exactly in the correct order.I did enjoy the squad aspect as far as AI goes. The command system was very good. I think I would have preferred to add one extra member to the team so I could sit back and let them finish the rest game by themselves.			"

												I am legitimately confused at why this game is so highly recommended in the Star Wars library. Seriously? What's so special about Republic Commando? The story was complete wank, first off. Everything was just one battlefield to another with no special connection. They try to tie them in with some ""mystery"" arc, but I never believed it, as they'd drop all sorts of ideas minutes after you'd hear them. The characters are all pretty stereotypical war game types: Boss is the Leader, Scorch is the Joker, Fixer is the... Fixer. However, I'll give it to Sev for being my favorite character. You'd figure in the middle of the war with all those millions of clones there'd be at least one who loved killing things, and that's really why I appreciate Sev so much. He's got some of the best lines in this game. But, in the contrast, Scorch has some of the WORST. He comes off as such forced humor, I'd constantly sigh a contemptuous breath every time he'd utter another snarky comment about the situation. And he has a limited number of dialogue options, so I'd hear those bloody jokes over and over and OVER again, till I wanted to strangle Scorch with my bare hands. On top of all this, the gameplay is hardly anything to brag about. It feels like the game was trying to be something of a Strategy game combined with an FPS years before Mass Effect came out and really solidified that type of game, and RC's attempt is just really... sloppy. The Strategy elements are simple and once you give your teammates something to do, the battle is pretty much in your favor. NEVER let them be idle, because the AI in this game is horrific, and the game itself is suscepticle to numerous glitches that'd often have me restart from my last save to make sure Fixer got in the bloody turret. The FPS gameplay in this is also totally off. The machine gun should- and again, for emphasis, should- be a moderate gun, but it's the weakest in your arsenal. Your pistol does more damage than it. I'm not kidding. Whenever I'd spray a Super Battle Droid with my machine gun, it felt about as effective and satisfying as spraying them with a water gun. There were parts I started to have fun in this constant, repetive shooting and running exercise, when I'd plan a bunch of traps for the enemies, but remember how bad the AI is? The enemies would just stand there, telepathically knowing all the traps I had cleverly laid down, putting all my work to shame, and putting me back into the monotony of shooting, commanding, covering, and running. The environments themselves lack a lot of vivid color. They're all greys and darker colors so it has this very muddy-like feel about it. For what it's worth, I'll give the game one other credit besides Sev. The windshield wiper. If you know anyone who's played it or if you've played it yourself- EVERYONE remembers the windshield wiper. It's a cute, humorous little thing. I liked it. But, seriously, though, that ending? I won't spoil anything, but it literally felt like the game had run out of ideas and just decided to end where it was, even though there was a story somewhere that needed to be finished, so they shoved in a couple BS lines (delivered by Yoda, of all people), and the game just... ends. I felt unsatisfied, bored, and ultimately angry with this Star Wars game. I really can't see a reason why other people like this one, but I'll always remember the windshield wiper. Forever. Everything else is just crap.			"

												Republic Commando is a pretty unique game... well for Star Wars, but nevermind that. It's refreshing to see a Star Wars story that doesn't care about light/dark side schenanigans. You never pick up a lightsaber, you never listen to sage jedi wisdom, you never even hear a single jedi voice. Rather, it takes the standard 4-man tactical blah blah blah and puts it IN SPAAAAAACE. However, Republic Commando does one unforgivable thing that pisses me off to no end: It throws infinitely respawning enemies against you while giving you limited ammunition. You're suppose to tactically flank these enemy spawners and draw fire as a squadmate goes to disarm it. However, the game seems to forget about this premise by the second half of the game. There's a specific part late in the game where there are several of these enemy spawners at the top of a stairwell, with no other path foward. The only thing you can do is just brute force your way through it. Then the near exact same scenario is repeated again. It's like moving a truck by repeatedly punching it, hoping it moves far enough before your fist breaks. I could forgive the game if this just happened once or twice, but the second half of the game is FILLED with these sort of scenarios. The game is definitely interesting enough to bring you through to the end. However, it was an experience that I stopped enjoying about halfway through. However, the parts without said enemy spawners were fun and possibly worth the price of admission.			"

												4 out of 10First person, squad based shooter.  You play as the commander of an elite Republic Commando unit. After reading the many positive reviews of this game I decided to try it out.  There are a lot of good aspects and the game and it could have been good. Sadly though, I progressed to a challenging point in the game were my squad mates kept on dying.  I put them behind cover and all of the rest as required but they die like flies.  After replaying the bit probably 10 times I decided to quit.  Not worth it. The game is somewhat outdated, particularly the low graphics settings, but this is not the end of the World.  The game worked without any problems.			"

												It's great to finally play this game.  However, it isn't all that really.  There's nothing new that hasn't been seen before.  The game mechanics are fairly linear & repetitive.  The range of weapons is fairly small & the squad mates aren't the smartest in terms of AI.Nice to tick it off the list but not much else aside from that.			"

												Sadly this game is a waste of money. There are no interesting objectives, you just have to destroy this object, get to that place or kill that evil dude. You have a sort of team, but you can only tell them to do things when the game needs you to do that specific thing, there´s no out of the box use of their actions. Moreover you can only tell them to be aggresive, to follow you or to guard the spot.Even though I bought this at the steamsale, I regret that decission.			"

												I recommend this game only for people who want to play a STAR WARS game that doesn't have Jedi in it. If you like military shooters or STAR WARS games, this game is mediocre at being both. STAR WARS Republic Commando takes place in the events that happen before episode 2 and episode 3 of the prequel trilogy. You are Delta 38 (voiced by Temuera Morrison himself) is the squad leader of Delta Squad; a clone commando unit. Your squad is sent on covert and high risk missions against the separatist forces. The rest of your squad (not voiced by Temuera Morrison) follow your orders as you tactically move through the missions to with the day. The biggest problem I have with this game are the weapons. Your main weapon, the blaster rifle, in particular is frustrating for how weak and inaccurate it is. It looks like a toy, and kicks like a mouse. Looking down the iron sights of this weapon doesn't do much for your accuracy and it takes up practically the whole screen while slowing you down to a walking pace. Your other weapons are a sniper rifle and a grenade launcher, but their ammo is scarce. This effectively forces you to use said blaster rifle most of the time. Although the game has special weapons you can pick up and use, many don't have the punch to really make a difference. The second aspect to this game is your squad. Your squad mates can be ordered to take up sniping positions; demolish targets; attack targets you mark etc. The squad are pretty interesting in their own right as they all have personalities that show in their dialogue and appearance. For AI characters, they stand out for being competent and effective. There were times I was hacking, or attaching a demolition charge and not receiving a scratch from the enemy. Not much else can be said about them really, except they have personalities and are competent squad mates. In 2005 (and today at times), that was impressive. The tactical aspect of this game is where this game fails. Its as deep as a kiddie pool, and not very complex. If you played games like Ghost recon or Rainbow Six; don't expect the same to challenge you. To have your squad snipe, use their grenade launcher, or even throw grenades you have to assign one of them to a designated spot and simply push a button. Maneuvers are assigned squad wide with no option to order a single soldier to defend a position or follow you. With this lack of flexibility to order your squad around, can make any veteran of tactical shooters disappointed and frustrated.In conclusion, this is one of those games that just hasn't aged well. It was impressive for its time, but there isn't anything enduring that can make it last as a classic. Aside from being a STAR WARS game without the iconic Jedi, there is nothing this game does that hasn't done better before or since in other games.			"

												This game had been pretty well received and my expectations were that of an older title, but my short experience was still a letdown. Republic Commando looks and feels like an older game, but not in a good way. It did not take long (just the first few levels) to realize what a problem the lack of variety would be. Enemies, weapons, and even actions your squadmates can do are limited and I could not imagine slogging through what HLTB says is a 9 hour campaign when I was bored within the first  hour.This might be a good game for big Star Wars fans, but for FPS enthusiasts - stay away.

												What a waste of $3...So, as is typical for games these days, the first level is all tutorial where you'll be told about HUD details, squad functions and key mappings in a rushed and unclear manner (think Elder Scrolls Online tutorial level). Irritating and boring but I kept playing and hoped it got better. It didn't, there wasn't a single moment where I shared my AI squadmate's enthusiasm or had an ""oh ♥♥♥♥ yeah!"" moment. It already feels like a Call of Duty: Star Wars mod with blander graphics. I gave up by the time I got deeper into Geonosys where there's these ""elite"" Geonosian bugs. Let me talk about the shooting micro mechanics here. Simply put, your aim is as bad as the Stormtroopers in the original SW trilogy (like when there were 5 troopers firing at a Luke standing in the open with no cover at the end of episode 4). You have an aiming reticle the size of a quarter and your shots will fire randomly within the circle meaning nearly EACH enemy will require an entire clip of ammuntion (no increased accuracy for controlled firing) and that's if you're aiming well! Now there's plenty of ammo pick ups laying around and perhaps this is just my personal taste but I can't ♥♥♥♥ing stand missing if my aim is dead on, and spending my entire munitions stores (max ammo count of 300) to kill just a few very basic grunt enemies is fackin' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.Then you're fighting these bugs that are jumping around like some kind of Spiderman-Batman hybrid, you got 15 different guys saying 15 different things on your comms, there's a damned earthquake going on so now your accuracy is REALLY ♥♥♥♥ed! It's like playing with some ADHD ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ whose laughing and jerking your mouse around on you while you're trying to play and your bullets are going all over the place!Where I finally said, ""♥♥♥♥ it"" and exited the game was when you meet these ""elite"" enemy types that I think are unkillable to me and there's an unlimited wave of grunt enemies coming at you. I spent over 900 rounds (thats grabbing ammo packs and resupplying to maxumum 3 times) trying to kill one single elite and he still wouldn't die. I couldn't revive a squadmate without getting gangraped by the constantly respawning enemies and the elite bug firing that sustained laser blast at me (you're vulnerable and interuptable for a few seconds when attempting to revive a squadmate).Final thoughts.It's just not fun, not even the SW name brought any enjoyment. Feels like a cash grab COD clone. Playing as a Republic Commando I think would actually be a fun premise for a COD clone, but its the♥♥♥♥♥♥controls and horrible ♥♥♥♥ing aim that kill it. It's like they thought making things as simple as killing bad guys should be needlessly complicated. It's only the first level and the most basic of enemies are taking an entire clip because your aim is so ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. Whoever thought this was a good idea should be fired. It literally ruins the game. At 3 dollars, I'd rather have bought two 40 oz malt liquors - I'm not kidding.I give this game 2 beers out of 10.			"

												Not much to say other than its not good and its not godawful, just average gameplay wise. What few gripes I have is with ally AI being rather stupid, not knowing to use bacta stations on their own or even when to take cover or fall back. What is more you don't even need alliess as you can do every one of their special abilities a lot easier and faster without your squad. Turning up the difficulty seems to do nothing, the game is obscenely easy.			"

												I felt the need to review this game since I bought it based on all the glowing, positive reviews it got. After actually playing it myself, however, I can say that most of these people must be delusional or something.Let me just start off by saying that the game IS really fun. The squad dynamic (when it actually works) is great to play around with in strategic situations and the characters are all interesting enough to make this come alive in some missions. The game also, apparently, ties into some of the books by the same name.While I would recommend this game to fans of Star Wars and the FPS genre in particular, it's ten years old at this point and has not really aged very well. Aside from that there are bugs and glitches everywhere on top of just poor design choices and lazy coding.Let's just got down the list, shall we? First off is the bugs. Oh the bugs. Enemies can sometimes shoot you straight through solid walls or between tiny cracks in scenery that you are unable to fire back through yourself. Trying to throw a grenade into enemy formations from behind cover will frequently have your grenades bouncing back at your own team often off of what seems to be thin air. Needless to say the hit detection sucks a fat one.Next thing is the AI, which is pretty bad for a game that revolves around a squad dynamic. I've lost count of how many times I've had to solo an encounter because my super elite delta squad members charge out strait into both mine and enemy fire or stood directly on a grenade that I just threw only to have other squad members rush out to try and revive them and also get obliterated. I had two instances where a squad member got stuck on map details because of bad path finding. The first instance had a squad member running straight into a rock trying to get to some waypoint or something and no command would pull him back so I had to fight a boss with just two squad members. The second was a bit later and a single member got stuck under a ramp of some kind because whatever command I gave him made him try to walk straight into the ramp so I ended up reloading. The enemy AI is a bit better but there's been a couple times where they've ignored a turret or something blasting away at them while they try to charge straight at me or a squad member.Next is the difficulty. I played on normal and I was basically quick saving and quick loading for every, single room. Some enemies can kill you in a single shot while others are just difficult to spot, will dodge out of your targeting reticle when you aim at them and never miss. There's also a strange disconnect with weapon damage. The Trandoshans in particular can often take an entire clip of ammo to the chest and keep coming but are supposed to just be regular enemies. They have this shotgun weapon you can pick up that you use to kill them in one or two hits but you have to basically ram it up their noses, at which point, you might as well just melee them. They however can use it to take half your health in a single shot from across an entire room.Last of all is simply that the game design itself is somewhat flawed on a fundamental level. Each mission has only a single path that you will ever go down. Sometimes they make it LOOK like you can maybe try different approaches or go a different way but there's really only one direction that is the ""right"" way and all others will lead to certain death. On top of this the core idea, squad command, just doesn't work properly most of the time. For example: I give the command that I want someone to take up a sniper position so my demolitions or close combat squad member will take up the position and gripe about how they're not a sniper. Then enemies will show up and they'll snipe the crap outta them no trouble while the actual sniper character just stands next to me looking rather stupid.In the end the game is actually pretty fun to play. I mean I'm certainly determined to beat it despite all these glaring issues but then I'm also a huge Star Wars / FPS fan. I'm not very good at writing reviews but, again, I felt the need to do so since everyone is recommending this game and not bothering to mention any of the very serious problems that absolutely plague the gameplay. Although seeing as I'm just a single voice surrounded by hundreds of other reviews, I doubt anyone will see this but, here it is.If you love Star Wars and FPS games get this one on sale. Otherwise, give it a miss.			"

												For a Tactical FPS, this game is surprisingly uninspiring. I'm a big fan of SWAT 4 and the complexity of the command system you can use with your squad in that game. The commands in this game are just too general and difficult to issue; if your reticle isn't exactly on the center of the object, you can't issue the command. That's annoying, because there's a lot of head bobbing in this game, and your units are slow to react. They're also incredibly stupid; why they don't take cover behind obstacles and barriers automatically I couldn't guess. What a disappointment. **			"

												I was really looking forward to this one.  I liked the idea of a game from the perspective of the clones, the morality of their lives versus that of the droid army and the Jedi's sort of indifference to it.  Sadly this game did not deliver on any of those notes.  Good combat dialogue between your team, but that was about it.  Same commands battle after battle until you're just looking to finish it off instead of wishing it went on and on.			"

												This is a terrible game.  Do not buy it unless you really love all things Star Wars.  The entire game, you fight the same basic 4 enemies.  Yes, there are a few more types, but they special, rare types like a few mini-bosses.    Your characters never improve and you never find better gear other than what you start with after the tutorial mission.  You can pick up one temporary drop from enemies, but there are only af ew types of weapons you can use, and only until your ammo runs out.You end up doing the same thing most every scenerio, only the scenery is different.  Combat is very wonkly.  You can be at full shields and health and instantly die.  You can also be standing infront of a squad of enemies who never seem to hit you.  It is very inconsistent.  Your AI squad loves to run off and die unless you keep tight control over them.  This is suppoed to be a squad of ""elite commandos', mind you.The developers had very few tricks in thier bag, and all they do is the same tricks over and over with increasing intensity.This game really ins't worth your time, let alone any actual money you might spend on it.

												This game is such a great classic game!I bought it when it was on sale and since then I didn't really find time to play it, but when I was younger I used to play the sh*t out of it!This game is one of the few FPS where one can actually care for the characters in the game, not like in CoD where everyone is a generic constellation of polygons...And that's kind of odd, clones being more different from one another than those ""realistic"" soldiers in recent games..In the following text I'll state some of the most important things and I hope, that one day you will like this game as much as I do!Graphics and atmosphere:The graphics are old, but what does one expect from a nearly 10 years old game?Nevertheless it's still perfectly playable, the sceneries are filled with atmosphere, the levels change from desert like design to a more futuristic design and then jump back into a even more primal design. (I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't mention the actual places.)_______________________________________Characters:You are the Boss. Like for real, his nickname is Boss. You are the commander of a squad of specially trained clone troopers, called Republic Commandos (roll credits). The rest of your squad are clones aswell, who could've figuered... and they also got special personalities; Scorch, your buddy when it comes to set up some explosives! But don't be fooled by his profession, he is the calmest one and has a joke ready for almost every situation.Sev, his long ranged abilites are only matched by his cold personality. He is your team's sniper, a rather quite guy but nevertheless still an awesome character. To say it in other words: ""Sev is a pretty cool guy, he kills aliens and doesn't afraid of anything."" (Got the refefrence?)Fixer, fixing stuff that wasn't even damaged in the first place. Fixer is your computer hacking professional and has traits of both other team mates, focused on the mission, but still in for a good old joke!_______________________________________Soundtrack:This. Theme. Is. Dope. Period.Seriously, the Song ""Vode An"" is a song written in the old language of a fictional warrior cult, called ""Mandalorians"". This catchy tune was performed by a choir and goose bumps are guaranteed!And that was only the main menu!In the rest of the game you're able to enjoy different songs and resamples of the music from Episode 1-3 (Some people may dislike those movies, but the music was great though!)_______________________________________Controls:The controls are normal FPS controls and even a new player only needs a few minutes to understand the controls.It may not feel as fluent as in more recent games, for example the fact, that weapons have a fixed accuracy, that doesn't change when you fire more bullets, might look a bit clunky compared to our New-Era-Games._______________________________________Gameplay:You are the commander of a elite troop of soldiers, so you are suited to be able to withstand even the greatest problems, against all odds. Well, aslong as you are using cover and you're able to aim!Speaking of cover, you can order your 3 different squadmates to do things like:Slice that console, commando!We could nee some explosives here!Assign sniper position!Mount that turret!Those are just some of the commands, during a playthrough you are able to encounter various more._______________________________________Storytelling:Like I mentioned before, you will encounter different level designs, depending on your progress.Every mission has various levels and when you completed your mission, you are deployed somewhere else, just like a real Clone-Trooper!The game follows a chronological path and takes place in the time between Episode 2 and 3. Most of the places you visit are part of the new trilogy viewers of these films will recognize them._______________________________________TL;DRGraphics+Atmosphere: 8/10 (Old but gold)Characters: 8/10 (A shooter with actual CHARACTERS!)Soundtrack: 9/10 (The music is simply stunning, just couldn't get myself to give a Halo-like 10, because Halo still owns the rank 1 most iconic music in my heart.)Controls: 7/10(Meanwhile a bit outdated, but still fine)Gameplay: 7/10 (We could have needed some more crucial commands, if you're good, you can get through without ordering most of the time)Storytelling: 7/10(Sadly just a seven from me this time, but the story is a great stand-alone story, but at the beginning of every chapter one has to understand the situation, but you get your basic intel through loading screen and an intro from your mission adviser in a cutscene like start)			"

												Really let's you experience a Star Wars feel that no other game has done. The squad element of the game worked great. Although it involves doing much of the same thing, and you can predict when a certian type of enemy is coming up, but it's not always that bad. Plus the game does such a great job with the gameplay mechanics and the squad's dialoge is quite entertaining in much of the game, so you don't really have a feeling of playing a boring shooter, and you actually feel like you're a part of the Delta Squad. As nerdy as that sounds, it's a great game, and I definitely think any Star Wars fan MUST play this game. **Side note; You must consider the age of this game before judging it based on graphics. For it's year, it was really an amazing game.**			"

												I got this game during the big annual star wars sale on may 4th and I'm glad I did. This game is one of the more overlooked games in the Star Wars franchise and that is definatly a shame. I and many others have had loads of fun with this game and I can gladly say the price is well worth it. It's a tactical FPS and that may turn some people off, but it's not very complecated and there's litte micro-management. It's actually pretty fasted paced for a tactial FPS game of it's time, you'll be blasting droids and other baddies every 30 seconds and the game never lets up until the end. It's also not very hard, but I did run into some tricky spots on my normal play through. The regular story campaign only takes about 9 hours and it has only 3 levels. However these levels never drag on and I hardly noticed they were all about the same length. It's a short game sure, but that's actually kinda nice. It starts of quickly, slows up to a nice build up at the start of level 2 and than it's full speed ahead until the credits roll. The multiplayer was run by gamespy so sadly I don't think we'll be seeing many matches of this game anymore. Either way this is still a great game and a fun reminader of days gone by.			"

												Star Wars: Republic Commando is a criminally underrated squad-based shooter.While I'm not a fan of the FPS genre in general, I had a great time playing Republic Commando. Many zones have interesting tactics you can assign you squad, and every corner of the map is a decision. Nothing stands out as ugly, distasteful, inappropriate or awkward. The squad mate radio chatter is entertaining, to say the least.The system requirements are *incredibly* low for the experience you get. It's really quite amazing how well this will run on even a terrible computer build. Check system specifications for full details :)There's something I can't quite find the words for that makes the game special. It's a certain atmosphere or perhaps a combination of comaraderie and personal triumph. Further, players get a fair amount of replayability with difficulty settings (which really ramps up some of the more difficult scenarios). After finishing the campaigns, special features become unlocked. All the footage and developer commentary about the attention to detail the game received was definitely worth a watch.When all is said and done, I think the art style is a bit dated, but the atmosphere lives on. 9.3/10			"

Speaking of multiplayer, it is medicore and you have to be 1 of them nerds that plays it 24/7 to be good. Even though it is an old game its the inner beauty that matters like the campagin :D.

												I got this game during the big annual star wars sale on may 4th and I'm glad I did. This game is one of the more overlooked games in the Star Wars franchise and that is definatly a shame. I and many others have had loads of fun with this game and I can gladly say the price is well worth it. It's a tactical FPS and that may turn some people off, but it's not very complecated and there's litte micro-management. It's actually pretty fasted paced for a tactial FPS game of it's time, you'll be blasting droids and other baddies every 30 seconds and the game never lets up until the end. It's also not very hard, but I did run into some tricky spots on my normal play through. The regular story campaign only takes about 9 hours and it has only 3 levels. However these levels never drag on and I hardly noticed they were all about the same length. It's a short game sure, but that's actually kinda nice. It starts of quickly, slows up to a nice build up at the start of level 2 and than it's full speed ahead until the credits roll. The multiplayer was run by gamespy so sadly I don't think we'll be seeing many matches of this game anymore. Either way this is still a great game and a fun reminader of days gone by.			"

												Playing this again, in a generation where the gaming technology has vastly improved, I can say proudly that Star Wars Republic Commando still holds up absolutely. This game utterly succeeds at immersing you into the spot of a Republic Commando, and all the squad management mechanics are fantastic in their design. Despite the fact that you play as the leader of a squad of elite death-dealing supersoldiers, this game is by no means an easy one. The opponents and environments you are put in are made to overpower you, and it's only through cold, hard strategy will you perservere. The story revolves around your Squad, and is grounded quite firmly there, in that everything in the game is seen from the visor of your player-character. All in all, if you're looking for a challenging, immersive, strategic FPS, and are a fan of Star Wars, you need this game.			"

												Simply put, awesome game.It really gets into your mind, you know?No fancy Jedis, or Jedi powers. Just you, your brothers, weapons, armor, and the war.Good element of tactics. If you don't use it, you fail. But AI can be fiercer, more realistic. Sometimes AI is pretty...""eh"". Still, the game gets to you pretty nicely. The only bad thing about this game is:1. AI can be better.2. Game can be longer. Its got three parts, but each part is pretty long enough...until you finish it that is.3. STILL NO SEQUEL. FOR GOODNESS SAKE MAN! SEQUEL! SEQUEL! SEQUEL!This game is cheap enough. For FPS freaks like me, GET IT.PS: Its got a ""crash upon startup and/or load"" problem that has never been solved and is related to its bump-mapping. I solved it by setting bump-mapping to low. For some peeps in the forums, that does not solve it. Thankfully, it solved it for me.Set bump-mapping low to prevent crashing, and set everything else as high as you can.			"

												This is one of those games that made me smile. Although this IS one of the shortest games I've played, it was an amazing ride that just waits to be replayed. Don't be turned off because it does not have fancy graohics, gameplay before graphics to me. The game plays surprisingly well for how old it is, it has aged quite nicely. I managed to beat the campaign in one day, it's short, sweet, and a decent challenge. I also enjoy this game because it manages to tell a good story with the gameplay mechanics it has. It's a squad based tactical first person shooter. You won't be swinging any fancy lightsabers or blocking any blaster lasers, you'll be doing the unsung work of the special forces of the clone army: the Commandos; and hell if it wasn't extremely fun. Usually in first person shooters the character developement is rather shallow, well, there isn'[t much in this game either, but it fits okay! You're a CLONE, your character doesn't matter! Right? Well, yes and no. You don't have much background or sappy stories being told among Delta Squad, and well, it fits with the fact that their clones! The character did however manage to do something a lot of other games can't, make me smile! The characters, who lack personal history due to being clones, express themselves in their witty quips or comments on you. One situation was when I blew up an enemy and my squadmate on accident and one of the other members said ""Command, send a replacement for 38."" (38 [three eight] being your callsign). It was funny okay...THIS GAME IS WORTH THE BUY.			"

												8.5/10 Occasionally frustrating (those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ scavengers!) but generally sound and worth your time. Amongst the last good games Lucasarts produced. Challenging at times, sometimes for the wrong reasons; enemies are sometimes just mobs of bulletsponges, which aren't fun to face, or damned impossible to hit.Nicely simple squad mechanics, and responsive gunplay. Weapons are varied enough to be interesting, and not so varied as to be confusing. Gameplay and level design ok, gets linear and repetetive after a while, with some contrivances (Oh look, a big room with crates and rocket ammo, I wonder what we'll be facing here....). Likeable characters who feel like the good kind of comic book soldiers, and surprisingly fun pulpy storyline, though the *ahem* emotional bit at the end falls massively flat and feels utterly irrelevant. Fits nicely into the mythos too.Not the best game ever, but nonetheless recommended.			"

Multiplayer is meh, but the singleplayer is great enough to warrant the 10 bucks on its own.

												This amazing Star Wars FPS gives me great memorys back in the day. Where me and my brother would pretend we are Storm troopers. This game was so good that I had to play it over and over. I couldn't get enough of this game.Pros:This game has a great story between the crew and the battefield. The game is quick to downloud (Depends on what type of computer). Heck it even downloaded quicker than I thought on my CRAPPY PC. And, the game ran smoothly. The guns are awesome and easy to use. The teamwork and commands are cool. The crew; 07 (Sev), 62 (Scorch), and 40 (fixer), are great companions (expectialy Scorch). The connection they have is so cool, like they're so loyal they they wouldn't queston your decisions. The dialoge is amazing. The voice acting is perfect, the jokes, the commands. Everything is so perfect. Overall this game is amazing. So amazing that 5 years later you'll be coming back to this game and play it for hours. An absolute 10/10 in my book.Cons:During my gameplay, I have encountered some bugs and glitches. Sometimes the team wouldn't follow me or follow my commands, or maybe it's me. But, during the mission in Kashyyk, 07 (Sev) Decided to fall back and get stuck on some object and stand there. I did had to back track to beat him up to get him out, or just straight up ditch him. But that happened rarely. Sometimes the team would just stop as i trott though the mission ALONE! Then I back track to get them. This only happened once, and is probably just my computer acting up. The game is short, only 4 places with tons of missions, and it's range of weapons, but still enjoyable to slaughter a great amount of droids. Which is resonable, but I wish this game had a sequall, or DLCs to see more of the story and gameplay. But, overall it just depends on the computer causing the glitches, and the companys decided to leave the Star Wars fracnchise, but they gave us a great FPS game. I have an old HP computer that is reaching close to it's end and the game is running smooth. So I didn't have much problems. Just the team ditching me XDOverall this game is great. Did find it hard on some levels...like the hangars, the bomb codes, the stupid Super Battle Droids posse ganging up on me (For GODS sake SAVE me SCORCH XD). But this game gives it's moments. This game is a must for Star Wars fanatics and for FPS shooters. I give this game a 10/10 (Sorry if this review is bad. This is my first review. If I missed anything sorry, didn't want to spoil the game. And sorry if i misspelled or drifted off of the things I'm saying. ME ENGLISH NO GOOD. I hope my review gets you to play this game, its worth it to slaughter all those droids with explosive weapons and projectiles. Have fun!) "

In short: It's old and not exactly gold, but still a fun and challenging experience that you won't regret.About your companions:Their AI is kind of bad when left on their own.They make better defenders than you, when ordered to take a defensive spot.You have to carefully pick if you want to work a console while they cover you or if you want one of them to do it while you cover him.You can't micro-manage them individually like you can in other games. You just give an order and one of them will take care of it.If you go down, you can order them to fight on or come and pick you up. If one of them goes down, you can pick them up or order somebody to pick them up.It is best to think of your companions as mobile turrets that canbe placed in overwatch positions.About your enemies and the campaign:The game is linear and gets repetitive, but you won't mind.You run into new enemies, bigger challenges, and larger groups of enemies that make the game hardr and harder.Enemies will ambush you when you expect it and when oyu don't.There are times when it gets really crazy with multiple droid spawners that really test your ability to manage your team while under heavy fire.You have three base weapons that you have to know when to use, along with four types of grenades, but you can also pick up special enemy weapoins, like the shotgun or heavy machinegun.Each enemy is vulnerable to a weapon type and grenade type. The game will not only test you on this in bulk, but it will also mix things up.Overall: A game that still looks and plays ok after all these years.			"

												While this is an old game it is one of the best shooters out there. Mechanics are solid and it has a better squad system than Halo: Gaurdians. There are stretches of the game where you are alone and this is when the game feels empty. It is the feeling of fighting amongst your clone brothers that makes the game interesting. The campaign takes about 10 hours to complete. Buy it now if a  dollar an hour is worth it to you otherwise wait for a sale.			"

												A good tactical shooter that reminds me of a mix of Rainbow Six 3, and Halo. Story is hit or miss depending on if you like Star Wars. The shooting is top notch and feels visceral and brutal. Its also a fairly challenging game, and has some really frustrating parts if you don't take your time. In particular there is a section that I needed a walkthrough for during the second deployment after you leave genosis. (Key hint, its the hallway of hell near the end. Shoot the turrets first.)Overall an excellent game that really makes the clone trooper the REAL star of Starwars. Silly Jedi, lightsabers are for kids.  Men use blasters.			"

												Republic commando is an awesome game in multiple aspects: pro's  Great voice acting by the original Temuera Morrison Good and entertaining story Unique FPS which uses squad dynamics. You are the boss, you are the one giving your three other squadmates their orders, be it sniping positions, slice that console! Get some Bacta, Man that turret! Take out target! Form up! Defend position! Seek and destroy! and many other commands, each presented in an easy, not at all difficult to understand Great AI, I've seldom seen an FPS with this wel coded AI. Your squad mates don't get in the way, take strategic cover all by themselves and are actually really helping! good weapons system, No need for upgrading all the time, These are your weapons: use them to win the war. They did add a fifth slot for temporary special weapons that can be found in the game. The game has great animations, even though the game itself is old and hasn't got the greatest graphics, the animations are well done, they look fluent and don't stutter when you give your commando's new orders. Few to no bugs. I've completed the game and haven't encountered a single bug. Maybe I was lucky but I don't think so. Cons  Story is pretty short (I want moar!!) Multiplayer now needs a 3d party tool because gamespy servers are no longer up. You never get to see what you look like :P "

												This game is such a great classic game!I bought it when it was on sale and since then I didn't really find time to play it, but when I was younger I used to play the sh*t out of it!This game is one of the few FPS where one can actually care for the characters in the game, not like in CoD where everyone is a generic constellation of polygons...And that's kind of odd, clones being more different from one another than those ""realistic"" soldiers in recent games..In the following text I'll state some of the most important things and I hope, that one day you will like this game as much as I do!Graphics and atmosphere:The graphics are old, but what does one expect from a nearly 10 years old game?Nevertheless it's still perfectly playable, the sceneries are filled with atmosphere, the levels change from desert like design to a more futuristic design and then jump back into a even more primal design. (I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't mention the actual places.)_______________________________________Characters:You are the Boss. Like for real, his nickname is Boss. You are the commander of a squad of specially trained clone troopers, called Republic Commandos (roll credits). The rest of your squad are clones aswell, who could've figuered... and they also got special personalities; Scorch, your buddy when it comes to set up some explosives! But don't be fooled by his profession, he is the calmest one and has a joke ready for almost every situation.Sev, his long ranged abilites are only matched by his cold personality. He is your team's sniper, a rather quite guy but nevertheless still an awesome character. To say it in other words: ""Sev is a pretty cool guy, he kills aliens and doesn't afraid of anything."" (Got the refefrence?)Fixer, fixing stuff that wasn't even damaged in the first place. Fixer is your computer hacking professional and has traits of both other team mates, focused on the mission, but still in for a good old joke!_______________________________________Soundtrack:This. Theme. Is. Dope. Period.Seriously, the Song ""Vode An"" is a song written in the old language of a fictional warrior cult, called ""Mandalorians"". This catchy tune was performed by a choir and goose bumps are guaranteed!And that was only the main menu!In the rest of the game you're able to enjoy different songs and resamples of the music from Episode 1-3 (Some people may dislike those movies, but the music was great though!)_______________________________________Controls:The controls are normal FPS controls and even a new player only needs a few minutes to understand the controls.It may not feel as fluent as in more recent games, for example the fact, that weapons have a fixed accuracy, that doesn't change when you fire more bullets, might look a bit clunky compared to our New-Era-Games._______________________________________Gameplay:You are the commander of a elite troop of soldiers, so you are suited to be able to withstand even the greatest problems, against all odds. Well, aslong as you are using cover and you're able to aim!Speaking of cover, you can order your 3 different squadmates to do things like:Slice that console, commando!We could nee some explosives here!Assign sniper position!Mount that turret!Those are just some of the commands, during a playthrough you are able to encounter various more._______________________________________Storytelling:Like I mentioned before, you will encounter different level designs, depending on your progress.Every mission has various levels and when you completed your mission, you are deployed somewhere else, just like a real Clone-Trooper!The game follows a chronological path and takes place in the time between Episode 2 and 3. Most of the places you visit are part of the new trilogy viewers of these films will recognize them._______________________________________TL;DRGraphics+Atmosphere: 8/10 (Old but gold)Characters: 8/10 (A shooter with actual CHARACTERS!)Soundtrack: 9/10 (The music is simply stunning, just couldn't get myself to give a Halo-like 10, because Halo still owns the rank 1 most iconic music in my heart.)Controls: 7/10(Meanwhile a bit outdated, but still fine)Gameplay: 7/10 (We could have needed some more crucial commands, if you're good, you can get through without ordering most of the time)Storytelling: 7/10(Sadly just a seven from me this time, but the story is a great stand-alone story, but at the beginning of every chapter one has to understand the situation, but you get your basic intel through loading screen and an intro from your mission adviser in a cutscene like start)			"

												I played this on 360 and was compelled to finish it. The game is well polished, the tutorial levels still captivate me on my second play through.The weapons feel good and you have a choice of different modes.Squad controls are simple and effective.Levels are linear in a good way (No stupid maze levels).Highly recommended.

												  I remember having Republic Comando on the Xbox and had a blast! We have all experienced bad AI but this game feels like your playing with actual players. Having a sensational campagin which brings back to the Clone Wars, but from a Comando's perspective. Although, I had a difficult time playing on PC lol, espically multiplayer. Speaking of multiplayer, it is medicore and you have to be 1 of them nerds that plays it 24/7 to be good. Even though it is an old game its the inner beauty that matters like the campagin :D. I recommend this game for Star War fans and 1st person shooter people. Enjoy!			"

												This is an amazing game. It's quite hard even on the lowest difficulty but only if you run in and act like it's a cod game. You actually need to utilize your squad commands to be able to get through some parts. The campaign is a good length and very fun. That being said there are also some parts that are frustrating, and they dont really introoduce your squad commands (Fkeys) very well in the begining, It's frustrating that the ""use"" button is also one of the command buttons even once you get used to it because it's a bit glitchy to do things yourself (you have to be in just the right position so far away). If they made a next gen sequal it might be GOTY matterial.Tl;dr THis games ♥♥♥♥in awesome, make a sequel			"

												Star Wars: Republic Commando is a criminally underrated squad-based shooter.While I'm not a fan of the FPS genre in general, I had a great time playing Republic Commando. Many zones have interesting tactics you can assign you squad, and every corner of the map is a decision. Nothing stands out as ugly, distasteful, inappropriate or awkward. The squad mate radio chatter is entertaining, to say the least.The system requirements are *incredibly* low for the experience you get. It's really quite amazing how well this will run on even a terrible computer build. Check system specifications for full details :)There's something I can't quite find the words for that makes the game special. It's a certain atmosphere or perhaps a combination of comaraderie and personal triumph. Further, players get a fair amount of replayability with difficulty settings (which really ramps up some of the more difficult scenarios). After finishing the campaigns, special features become unlocked. All the footage and developer commentary about the attention to detail the game received was definitely worth a watch.When all is said and done, I think the art style is a bit dated, but the atmosphere lives on. 9.3/10			"

												This game, in my opinion, is one of the most underrated stories to come out of LucasArts. The studio in charge of this game did a fantastic job; the only thing you could really ask for is an update on some of the lighting textures. The graphics style is fairly better than the originals, the story is surprisingly well done, the theme song is crazy good, and the gameplay still is relatively solid. Fair warning, though, your AI partners are stupid, and will make the hardest difficulty just a cluster of your teammates' incompitence.Also, sort of spoilers, the ending will make you wish this series wasn't shut down.

												I'm not a big fan of FPSers, mainly because I can't shoot strait, but I'm a big fan of Star Wars, so I decided to give this a try... And I wasn't disappointed!The story starts during the Clone War (before Episode III) and you play as the leader of Delta Squad, an elite combat unit. Your squad members are: Delta 07 (sniper) - code name: SEV, Delta 40 (tech) - code name: FIXER and Delta 62 (demo) - code name: SCORCH. The objective: galactic cleanup.First, let me say, that the VA is fantastic. It's light-hearted, well-written and performed to perfection. You are in the middle of a war, but it never gets too serious, which is good for someone like me, who are not fans of the genre. Jonathan David Cook (07), Temuera Morrison (38), Andrew Chaikin (40) and Raphael Sbarge (62) must be applauded!The gameplay is smooth and uncomplicated and the controls are easy. In regards to difficulty, easy really is EASY, and it only gets a little tougher once you progress.The story is linear... and it works brilliantly. It would hate to see this in an open world environment. It sticks to what it is, a simple fps, that gives you a sense of what you're doing.If I have to say anything negative about this game, it would be that it is too short. You can complete it in a day.In conclusion: if you are looking for an uncomplicated and fun fps, this is it! It feels like Star Wars, and that is important to me.			"

												Star Wars: Republic commando is the best strategic game I have ever played. The makers of the game got their inspiration from ningas from Japan in the 1400s, Roman centurions from ancient Rome and American Navy SEALs from today. It is so simplistic and easy to tell your squad of 4 men yourself included exactly what to do and where to do it. I hope when EA makes their games for Star Wars, that they make commando missions in the games like this or a whole new game devoted to commando missions. Lucas Arts got this so right when they made this game. It is amazing!!!			"

												A fantastic story driven FPS, my only gripe with RC is it's length. With a mere 8.4 hours for me to complete the campaign, I feel that if really needs either some DLC or a full blown sequel. The difficulty felt just right; Hard enough for me to die a fair amount and feel challenged, but easy enough for me to complete it without a major ragequit.

												Do you like Halo? No? Well do you like Star Wars? You don't? Well then why are you even looking at this game?Anyway, Star Wars: Republic Commando is essentially, as I said above, Halo but Star Wars. And maybe a little bit of Mass Effect's squad-managment in there. The story is great, the characters are great, the gameplay is great, but there are a couple things that aren't so good about this game. First off, good luck using a sniper's scope if you have Windows 8, because clicking the middle mouse button will do the same as pressing f11 (I think it's f11) on a Mac. Second, either there's something wierd with my computer, or no one plays the multiplayer. One last thing, was the ending. I don't want to give anything away, but let's just say that the ending most certainly warrants a sequel for the game.			"

												Quite repetitive and graphically limited to Halo 2 level.  On the other hand, I found myself trying different playstyles with different commands to my subordinates.  Their NPC voicing is good, and not too repetitive, somewhat like Halo's, and much more relevant to the scene than Mass Effect's.  Takes around 6 hours to finish the campaign.  For the low price, this game is worth playing.			"

												A childhood game and one of the best that I played on the Xbox. However I lost the game much to my own displeasure, but after reaquiring it on steam; it feels so good to relive the old memories. The game's story, characters, enivronment, and items all match the universe that its in, and ties in very well with the first mission being on Genosis in Star Wars II: The clone wars, and  the battle on kashyyk. Being a leader never felt like so much fun and really has to make you think on what's the best strategy to get you and your squad through, since you maybe a elite clone, but your nothing without your squad; and that's what I see as the game's biggest strength: Delta Squad. There is at least one member in Delta Squad you can bond with and all of them have distinct and unique personalities and voices, as well as specialites (i.e Fixer being control panels and breaching; Sev for sniping and heavy weapons; and Scorch for demolitions and breaches). As for yourself being in the boots of Delta Squad Leader 38, a direct clone from Jango Fett himself, are the brains of the group.The A.i for the squad can be a bit iffy, such as sometimes not firing at an enemy when they are standing right infront of them, or even sometimes can be rarely caught suspended in the air (happened once with scorch, though going into the next level fixed this). However that still doesn't change the fact that the A.I for the game was very much implemented in how it should. Squad mates would take cover, throw back grenades that were tossed at them, heal themselves and revive downed squadmates, there was no need to think about babysitting, and they could handle themself especially if you place in them in a good formation, and even when you go down, they can take care of the battle before helping you back up to your feet.This game has topped halo for me personally, and I will always come back to this game to try out new strategies and tougher difficulites to see if I can really be a true leader~!

												Star Wars Republic Comando may just be the best Star Wars game ever released.The whole gameplay experience is like watching a classic Star Wars movie that just doesn't end. Hours of ongoing scenery dialogs followed by an outstanding OST. I am not a Star Wars fan whatsoever, but I will admit it, this game is a must-have for anyone seriously into Star Wars franchise, or even into games with great storyline.Pros:-Linear gameplay, movie-like experience.-An outstanding OST.-Decent graphics and design for a game made almost a decade ago.-Smart AI, a thing so rare in games nowadays.-Intuitive squad controls.-Many hours of fun.Cons:-Buggy graphics with modern hardware (ATI/AMD cards won't support the buggy bumpmap on Medium or High and will crash the game)-3D sound drivers are not properly compatible with newer sound cards.Should you buy this game, even a decade after its release? YES. I played this long ago, and I just couldn't resist of playing it again. The moment you launch the game and the main menu OST kicks in, you're set for a journey.I completed the campaign for about 9 hours on Medium.			"

												Even though it is an old game it is still worth what you pay for it. It has a mass effect feel to it with the star wars characters. Great story line with various dialogue throughout. This game may never be as good as portal or allow you as many hours but is still worth having a play out of it. The four hours of gameplay i have played so far (04/05/14) have been intriguing and i have struggled to put the game down. Multiplayer allows the common deathmatch, team deathmatch and capture the flag. Controls are simple and easy to learn. Overall i would givethis game a 7/10 as it has room for improvement e.g graphics but is great in other aspects e.g story/gameplay.			"

												This game is almost 10 years old and it still is fantasic! I gotta say for as old as it is the graphics look pretty good, on par with Halo 2. The gameplay is alright I mean I kinda wish there was kickback but its nice ordering your squad around to take formation or to hop on a turret. The voice acting for a game of this time is amazing on par with games today if not even better imo. The AI is alright I mean it was xbox times, would've been nice to get a sequel on the 360 back in the day to see more enemies and better AI maybe EA will bring it back...after all they are bringing back Battlefront so one can hope. Would be nice to see if they did make a sequel/remake some 4 player co-op or something, maybe some COD/BF type stuff like vehicles or something. A survival mode would be cool as well. Anyways I highly recommend this game, its one of the few games I enjoy in the SW universe that doesn't focus so much on Jedi and Sith...theres more to SW then Jedi vs Sith idk why game devolopers can't understand that (was looking forward to 1313 for that exact reason). If you like FPS games I recommend trying this, its $3 atm what you got to loose?			"

												despite it's age and how short the campaign is, republic commando is a game that is definitely worth playing as it puts you through the perspective of a clone commando and how they deal with the war and their perspective on it.In addition, you are able to command an elite squad of clone commandoes and issue them orders to overcome the enemy through superior tactics.

												First off: I'm not a die-hard Star Wars fan.I'll be honest, I have games I've purchased and never played. This isn't one of them. In a rarity, I finished the game in two sittings and found myself enjoying Delta Squad. Probably one of the most fun games in the Star Wars universe I've played. Yeah, the graphics can be outdated, but thankfully it's possible to change the .ini file to get widescreen and modern cards will make this game super sharp and not a jaggy in sight.Fantastic music and I recommend this.

												Went back to this game after years.  This still holds up, but it has a short story (like 8 hours on easy) but other than that it is pretty awesome.  Note for modders out there it looks like there is a lot of difficulty modding it and there are few mods available .			"

												This amazing Star Wars FPS gives me great memorys back in the day. Where me and my brother would pretend we are Storm troopers. This game was so good that I had to play it over and over. I couldn't get enough of this game.Pros:This game has a great story between the crew and the battefield. The game is quick to downloud (Depends on what type of computer). Heck it even downloaded quicker than I thought on my CRAPPY PC. And, the game ran smoothly. The guns are awesome and easy to use. The teamwork and commands are cool. The crew; 07 (Sev), 62 (Scorch), and 40 (fixer), are great companions (expectialy Scorch). The connection they have is so cool, like they're so loyal they they wouldn't queston your decisions. The dialoge is amazing. The voice acting is perfect, the jokes, the commands. Everything is so perfect. Overall this game is amazing. So amazing that 5 years later you'll be coming back to this game and play it for hours. An absolute 10/10 in my book.Cons:During my gameplay, I have encountered some bugs and glitches. Sometimes the team wouldn't follow me or follow my commands, or maybe it's me. But, during the mission in Kashyyk, 07 (Sev) Decided to fall back and get stuck on some object and stand there. I did had to back track to beat him up to get him out, or just straight up ditch him. But that happened rarely. Sometimes the team would just stop as i trott though the mission ALONE! Then I back track to get them. This only happened once, and is probably just my computer acting up. The game is short, only 4 places with tons of missions, and it's range of weapons, but still enjoyable to slaughter a great amount of droids. Which is resonable, but I wish this game had a sequall, or DLCs to see more of the story and gameplay. But, overall it just depends on the computer causing the glitches, and the companys decided to leave the Star Wars fracnchise, but they gave us a great FPS game. I have an old HP computer that is reaching close to it's end and the game is running smooth. So I didn't have much problems. Just the team ditching me XDOverall this game is great. Did find it hard on some levels...like the hangars, the bomb codes, the stupid Super Battle Droids posse ganging up on me (For GODS sake SAVE me SCORCH XD). But this game gives it's moments. This game is a must for Star Wars fanatics and for FPS shooters. I give this game a 10/10 (Sorry if this review is bad. This is my first review. If I missed anything sorry, didn't want to spoil the game. And sorry if i misspelled or drifted off of the things I'm saying. ME ENGLISH NO GOOD. I hope my review gets you to play this game, its worth it to slaughter all those droids with explosive weapons and projectiles. Have fun!) "

In short: It's old and not exactly gold, but still a fun and challenging experience that you won't regret.About your companions:Their AI is kind of bad when left on their own.They make better defenders than you, when ordered to take a defensive spot.You have to carefully pick if you want to work a console while they cover you or if you want one of them to do it while you cover him.You can't micro-manage them individually like you can in other games. You just give an order and one of them will take care of it.If you go down, you can order them to fight on or come and pick you up. If one of them goes down, you can pick them up or order somebody to pick them up.It is best to think of your companions as mobile turrets that canbe placed in overwatch positions.About your enemies and the campaign:The game is linear and gets repetitive, but you won't mind.You run into new enemies, bigger challenges, and larger groups of enemies that make the game hardr and harder.Enemies will ambush you when you expect it and when oyu don't.There are times when it gets really crazy with multiple droid spawners that really test your ability to manage your team while under heavy fire.You have three base weapons that you have to know when to use, along with four types of grenades, but you can also pick up special enemy weapoins, like the shotgun or heavy machinegun.Each enemy is vulnerable to a weapon type and grenade type. The game will not only test you on this in bulk, but it will also mix things up.Overall: A game that still looks and plays ok after all these years.			"

												I'm terrible at this game, but I like it a lot. Something about the quiet teamwork of Delta Squad is a lot more confidence-inspiring than the most ooh-rah COD/Rainbow Six/Battlefield games. Granted, this game has defunct/crappy multiplayer, and might seem like a rail-shooter to a jumping headshot ninja master, but as a single-player mid-tough FPS experience, it's definitely my speed.Smart tactics are a necessity in the most contested firefights. Suppressing fire, sniping, armor, and grenadier work by your squad mates are the only way to get through some of the battles. While there's a puzzly/""find the boss's' blind spot"" feel to some of the fights, the game strikes a good balance between working your reflexes and rewarding smart choices.After Tie Fighter and KOTOR, this is my favorite Star Wars game. Pour one out for the LucasArts/THQ teams of old. I hope someone picks up this IP and makes a sequel.Maybe they can combine this with the Jedi Academy engine for a Force Awakens spin-off! I hope the Lucasfilm people will consider that, as they enjoy their brandy and cigars while sunning themselves by their rooftop swimming pool full of money. "

												A good tactical shooter that reminds me of a mix of Rainbow Six 3, and Halo. Story is hit or miss depending on if you like Star Wars. The shooting is top notch and feels visceral and brutal. Its also a fairly challenging game, and has some really frustrating parts if you don't take your time. In particular there is a section that I needed a walkthrough for during the second deployment after you leave genosis. (Key hint, its the hallway of hell near the end. Shoot the turrets first.)Overall an excellent game that really makes the clone trooper the REAL star of Starwars. Silly Jedi, lightsabers are for kids.  Men use blasters.			"

												WARNING: Contains a little bit of spoilersThis game is the greatest and most epic game i've ever played. Although i expected to see alot for live troopers(like thousand) it's still amazing even after a decade since i played it on the original xbox it's still amazing. It makes me feel just like a clonetrooper. Although i have 10 hrs of gameplay i felt it was a little short. I really wish they will make a sequel or even a DLC to make the campaign longer its amazing i cant emphasis it more. 11/10 greatest FPS for me. To me, the graphics is 100/10 and so is the sound. its like u are there with Delta Squad. To many, maybe the graphics are grainy and pixelilated or whatever u cant really expect 1050p for a game so old and legendary. 11/10			"

												While this is an old game it is one of the best shooters out there. Mechanics are solid and it has a better squad system than Halo: Gaurdians. There are stretches of the game where you are alone and this is when the game feels empty. It is the feeling of fighting amongst your clone brothers that makes the game interesting. The campaign takes about 10 hours to complete. Buy it now if a  dollar an hour is worth it to you otherwise wait for a sale.			"

												This is one of those games that made me smile. Although this IS one of the shortest games I've played, it was an amazing ride that just waits to be replayed. Don't be turned off because it does not have fancy graohics, gameplay before graphics to me. The game plays surprisingly well for how old it is, it has aged quite nicely. I managed to beat the campaign in one day, it's short, sweet, and a decent challenge. I also enjoy this game because it manages to tell a good story with the gameplay mechanics it has. It's a squad based tactical first person shooter. You won't be swinging any fancy lightsabers or blocking any blaster lasers, you'll be doing the unsung work of the special forces of the clone army: the Commandos; and hell if it wasn't extremely fun. Usually in first person shooters the character developement is rather shallow, well, there isn'[t much in this game either, but it fits okay! You're a CLONE, your character doesn't matter! Right? Well, yes and no. You don't have much background or sappy stories being told among Delta Squad, and well, it fits with the fact that their clones! The character did however manage to do something a lot of other games can't, make me smile! The characters, who lack personal history due to being clones, express themselves in their witty quips or comments on you. One situation was when I blew up an enemy and my squadmate on accident and one of the other members said ""Command, send a replacement for 38."" (38 [three eight] being your callsign). It was funny okay...THIS GAME IS WORTH THE BUY.			"

												Simply put, awesome game.It really gets into your mind, you know?No fancy Jedis, or Jedi powers. Just you, your brothers, weapons, armor, and the war.Good element of tactics. If you don't use it, you fail. But AI can be fiercer, more realistic. Sometimes AI is pretty...""eh"". Still, the game gets to you pretty nicely. The only bad thing about this game is:1. AI can be better.2. Game can be longer. Its got three parts, but each part is pretty long enough...until you finish it that is.3. STILL NO SEQUEL. FOR GOODNESS SAKE MAN! SEQUEL! SEQUEL! SEQUEL!This game is cheap enough. For FPS freaks like me, GET IT.PS: Its got a ""crash upon startup and/or load"" problem that has never been solved and is related to its bump-mapping. I solved it by setting bump-mapping to low. For some peeps in the forums, that does not solve it. Thankfully, it solved it for me.Set bump-mapping low to prevent crashing, and set everything else as high as you can.			"

												8.5/10 Occasionally frustrating (those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ scavengers!) but generally sound and worth your time. Amongst the last good games Lucasarts produced. Challenging at times, sometimes for the wrong reasons; enemies are sometimes just mobs of bulletsponges, which aren't fun to face, or damned impossible to hit.Nicely simple squad mechanics, and responsive gunplay. Weapons are varied enough to be interesting, and not so varied as to be confusing. Gameplay and level design ok, gets linear and repetetive after a while, with some contrivances (Oh look, a big room with crates and rocket ammo, I wonder what we'll be facing here....). Likeable characters who feel like the good kind of comic book soldiers, and surprisingly fun pulpy storyline, though the *ahem* emotional bit at the end falls massively flat and feels utterly irrelevant. Fits nicely into the mythos too.Not the best game ever, but nonetheless recommended.			"

												When this game came out in 2005 my family rented it for a short period of time (at least we were supposed to) my brother and I (mostly my brother) played this game to death. When the rental ended we had to do the only thing we could, we bought it. We finished the game within a week (being younger and all) and we lost it. Remebering this a few years later I searched for the game in our house remembering the stunning visuals for its time, the great gameplay, and the mazing A.I that was usually better than my brother and I. Not being able to find it in our house (we came to the conclusion one of my brothers friends stole it) I bought it on steam. God did I not regret that.  I was blown away I felt more enjoyment in this game than most first person shooters today. Great game. Great buy. Now get this game soldier!			"

												Star Wars: Republic Commando is probably one of the most advanced squad games ever. Simple to learn and use, your squad follows all of your commands. They do so very professionaly by looking for cover while advancing, geting Bacta when needed, and using everything to their advantage. Overall, this is a very good FPS game that can be mastered by anyone in an hour or two, but will be played for days.			"

												This game is such a great classic game!I bought it when it was on sale and since then I didn't really find time to play it, but when I was younger I used to play the sh*t out of it!This game is one of the few FPS where one can actually care for the characters in the game, not like in CoD where everyone is a generic constellation of polygons...And that's kind of odd, clones being more different from one another than those ""realistic"" soldiers in recent games..In the following text I'll state some of the most important things and I hope, that one day you will like this game as much as I do!Graphics and atmosphere:The graphics are old, but what does one expect from a nearly 10 years old game?Nevertheless it's still perfectly playable, the sceneries are filled with atmosphere, the levels change from desert like design to a more futuristic design and then jump back into a even more primal design. (I don't want to spoil anything, so I won't mention the actual places.)_______________________________________Characters:You are the Boss. Like for real, his nickname is Boss. You are the commander of a squad of specially trained clone troopers, called Republic Commandos (roll credits). The rest of your squad are clones aswell, who could've figuered... and they also got special personalities; Scorch, your buddy when it comes to set up some explosives! But don't be fooled by his profession, he is the calmest one and has a joke ready for almost every situation.Sev, his long ranged abilites are only matched by his cold personality. He is your team's sniper, a rather quite guy but nevertheless still an awesome character. To say it in other words: ""Sev is a pretty cool guy, he kills aliens and doesn't afraid of anything."" (Got the refefrence?)Fixer, fixing stuff that wasn't even damaged in the first place. Fixer is your computer hacking professional and has traits of both other team mates, focused on the mission, but still in for a good old joke!_______________________________________Soundtrack:This. Theme. Is. Dope. Period.Seriously, the Song ""Vode An"" is a song written in the old language of a fictional warrior cult, called ""Mandalorians"". This catchy tune was performed by a choir and goose bumps are guaranteed!And that was only the main menu!In the rest of the game you're able to enjoy different songs and resamples of the music from Episode 1-3 (Some people may dislike those movies, but the music was great though!)_______________________________________Controls:The controls are normal FPS controls and even a new player only needs a few minutes to understand the controls.It may not feel as fluent as in more recent games, for example the fact, that weapons have a fixed accuracy, that doesn't change when you fire more bullets, might look a bit clunky compared to our New-Era-Games._______________________________________Gameplay:You are the commander of a elite troop of soldiers, so you are suited to be able to withstand even the greatest problems, against all odds. Well, aslong as you are using cover and you're able to aim!Speaking of cover, you can order your 3 different squadmates to do things like:Slice that console, commando!We could nee some explosives here!Assign sniper position!Mount that turret!Those are just some of the commands, during a playthrough you are able to encounter various more._______________________________________Storytelling:Like I mentioned before, you will encounter different level designs, depending on your progress.Every mission has various levels and when you completed your mission, you are deployed somewhere else, just like a real Clone-Trooper!The game follows a chronological path and takes place in the time between Episode 2 and 3. Most of the places you visit are part of the new trilogy viewers of these films will recognize them._______________________________________TL;DRGraphics+Atmosphere: 8/10 (Old but gold)Characters: 8/10 (A shooter with actual CHARACTERS!)Soundtrack: 9/10 (The music is simply stunning, just couldn't get myself to give a Halo-like 10, because Halo still owns the rank 1 most iconic music in my heart.)Controls: 7/10(Meanwhile a bit outdated, but still fine)Gameplay: 7/10 (We could have needed some more crucial commands, if you're good, you can get through without ordering most of the time)Storytelling: 7/10(Sadly just a seven from me this time, but the story is a great stand-alone story, but at the beginning of every chapter one has to understand the situation, but you get your basic intel through loading screen and an intro from your mission adviser in a cutscene like start)			"

												Republic Commando is a high action look into the Star Wars universe through the eyes of a special clone commando unit. This is a great shooter where you control your squad to kill droids and complete missions that took place during the clone wars.Each new area you visit is unique and presents a challenge as you lead your very own clone squad on special missions. Telling them to take up positions and stratigising adds a fun layer to the already excellent combat.Solid gameplay with no unresonable dificulty jumps, weapons for every occasion, and well crafted enviroments. Also, it is fun to listen to the commandos in your unit talk trash to the droids and make funny remarks.A well made shooter, all in all. I say its worth getting.			"

												Probably one of the best Star Wars games in the whole saga, definitely on my top 5. Too bad EA didn't pick stuff from here for Battlefront, and I'm kinda surprised there isn't a sequel for this amazing game. But that's probably a good thing too ;)I was a little skeptical at the beginning, since I'm not a big fan of the clone wars stories, but you kinda forget about that and really immerse into the gameplay and just having fun in general. After learning the basics, the mechanics are pretty natural, and strategies become super fun when you need to do coordinated attacks (which are 80% of the times). If you're looking for a main story star wars game, you're gonna be a little dissapointed. If you like the expanded universe and all the little details (specially if you liked Disney's Clone Wars tv show), then you're in for a treat with this game :)			"

												One of the few tactical shooters I can stand, also happens to be one of the best Star Wars games in the galaxy. The shooting may be a bit dull, there may only be a few weapons and you can finish the story in one night if you have nothing better to do, but there's an odd charm to this game. The characters certainly help this by being pretty distinctive and interesting; both the voice acting and writing is top-notch. The story is pretty standard Star Wars fare, but because the lead characters are clones it's a lot less ""YOU GOTSTA STOP DER SITH!!1"" and a lot more ""HOOAH!"" In addition, the graphics still hold up well thanks to their stylized realism. Although repeditive at times, the levels are pretty great and you'd have to be as dumb as a womp rat to get lost in them. Lastly: retractable fist-knife? Coolest. Weapon. Ever.			"

												So this is my first review of any game and I've played a lot of steam games. This particular gem was one I started long ago on the console but never got to finish it due to time constraints. I came across this during a steam sale of a collection of star wars games. That being said as soon as I discovered that I possessed this, I immediately started playing this. After beating it, it left such a good impression on me that I couldn't help but write a detailed review over it. I'll try to break things down into different categories and give my final two cents.Graphics: Considering that the game is dated back to 2005 on the XBox (literally 11 years and 2 days at the time of this review), the graphics aren't the best when you compare it to today's hi tech stuff. Once you get over that and appreciate the visuals for what it is during that time period, it is quiet a beautiful environment. All the enemies are detailed to scale, the settings you traverse look gorgeous, and the weaponry look pretty good too. I had no problems at all coursing through this game.Controls: They are somewhat clunky in certain areas. Playing off of mouse and keyboard the reaction is spot on as well is the movement. A couple times clicking the melee button on the keyboard didin't respond fast enough. My only real complaint was that the zooming feature of sniping was bit cumbersome to cycle through. Besides that tidbit the controls served me quite nicely.Audio: The musical score and scripts were fantastic. From creepy like scenes to the traditional star wars trumpeting to the more militaristic theme song of the clone troopers, the game didn't fail to bring you into the enviroment. During fights did I tune it out but it served well as ambiance. The dialog in the game is by far the shining point of this game. As the main character Delta 38 your character is voiced by Temuera Morrison aka Jango Fett. From issuing orders to commenting on the story to talking to his squadmates, one doesn't get tired of hearing his voice. Ontop of the other 3 troopers and the advisor, you really feel like you're a leader issuing orders and expanding the story. The inner dialogue between each trooper is quite appreciative. It would have made the game a bit dull if each trooper didn't have their own personality.Story: The story of a commando unit is pretty immersive. You get a quick setup of your origins and meet your team. After the brief prologue you go through stage after stage uncovering a bigger plot involved for the level as you complete each objective. From my perspective I never really gave much thought about the over arching story. I think that was the point of the game. You're a soldier and the information you're given is a need to know basis or stumbling across it as events unfold. The only true negative in all of this is that you are left on a cliff hanger and that the supposed sequel for this game is on hiatus. Gamplay: I played this game on hard so I used QuickSave a LOT to get through the game. There were moments that you felt overwhelmed as you have pretty stacked odds of tough AI against you followed by pride when you accomplished it. The real difficulty wasn't the tough enemies or type of enemies or amount of enemies but how flimsy your main character was. I didn't play normal so I have no idea what the differences are. The AI could hit harder and last longer. My character could have shorter life. Maybe there are more enemies. Either way it was pretty apparent that your comrades could tank quite a bit whereas that same punishment applied to you would floor you in less than a second. It was the number one negative in the game. I get that on hard you're a bit weaker life wise but make it consistent with your squadmates. I went through the game issuing orders to kill certain enemies or reviving me while I would run and gun around cover when I was up. Besides that, completing the game on hard felt pretty rewarding. The hardest moment in the game is to accomplish an objective within 5 minutes else you lose. Oh yeah don't forget the hoards of enemies that are between you and your object. Nearing the end of each level meant that the punches were no longer pulled as you faced wave after wave of super enemies instead of scrubs. You felt a sense of accomplisment finishing that level.Overall thought: This game is worth getting. Full price? Probably not. I'd wait for a sale but when you get it, I highly recommed to play through the game on hard. There are no achievements just you, some grit, and your 3 commandos against the Separatists. Just make sure you have the patience for it. I finished this game in 17 hours. No doubt the amount of times to restart a certain section over and over to perfection probably contributed to that length of time. Lastly you see a side of the star wars universe through the eyes of a soldier. A badass one at that. That alone makes the game worth getting and beating. It is simply sad that the sequel may never come to life and simply leaving you on a cliffhanger.Rating: 9/10			"

												An older game (2005) but none the less is still as great as it was back when I had it on the Xbox years ago and it's still quite fresh (imo)You take control of the leader of Delta Squad a team of higher ranking Clones that go one more dagerous missions than regular troopers doWhich is a nice treat since we usually see alot of clones being killed or being somewhat like cannon fodder (in a sense) (if you've watched Star Wars The Clone Wars or Star Wars Clone Wars you'll know what I mean.) It's nice to see these clones going through their opperations helping by taking one bigger risks than most and even after 12 years since this game has been out I still recommned it to any Star Wars or FPS fan.I still give it a 10/10 and for $11 (Canadian I guess it Depends where you live in the world) the price is great.

												I'm not a big fan of FPSers, mainly because I can't shoot strait, but I'm a big fan of Star Wars, so I decided to give this a try... And I wasn't disappointed!The story starts during the Clone War (before Episode III) and you play as the leader of Delta Squad, an elite combat unit. Your squad members are: Delta 07 (sniper) - code name: SEV, Delta 40 (tech) - code name: FIXER and Delta 62 (demo) - code name: SCORCH. The objective: galactic cleanup.First, let me say, that the VA is fantastic. It's light-hearted, well-written and performed to perfection. You are in the middle of a war, but it never gets too serious, which is good for someone like me, who are not fans of the genre. Jonathan David Cook (07), Temuera Morrison (38), Andrew Chaikin (40) and Raphael Sbarge (62) must be applauded!The gameplay is smooth and uncomplicated and the controls are easy. In regards to difficulty, easy really is EASY, and it only gets a little tougher once you progress.The story is linear... and it works brilliantly. It would hate to see this in an open world environment. It sticks to what it is, a simple fps, that gives you a sense of what you're doing.If I have to say anything negative about this game, it would be that it is too short. You can complete it in a day.In conclusion: if you are looking for an uncomplicated and fun fps, this is it! It feels like Star Wars, and that is important to me.			"

												Very good singleplayer campaign, although it's a bit short.  The epilogue leavs plenty of room for a sequel. It does take a very dark spin on the Star Wars Universe many LEGO Star Wars-loving kids grew up to know and love. The combat is great, and takes more than just shooting everything; it takes a nice amount of strategy and planning in order to succeed. However, my only complaint with the game is that it has yet to get a sequel. A sequel would be fantastic for this game, considering the new improvements in game engines since this game was created. Maybe the sequel will get up to my 1920x1080 screen resolution...			"

												I strongly recommend this game, not because Star Wars games are fun just because its a Star Wars game with a little bit of a challenge but it does have it floor with the bots :/ at times they will get stuck half way accross the map but thats not all sometimes you can fall off map because textures dissapear...from one of my screen shots when you have to infiltrate the ghost ship you go through exhaust pipes and I had randomly fell off the ship and was walking around the background :/ but all in all amazing game and totally worth the price makes a nice change from Battlefront 2 which seems to be to easy compared to this!! BUY IT!			"

												While i have missed the hype train on this game in the past, as a new player to the experience i do say that the controls work very well, the game feels responsive and doesnt look bad for it's age. It also runs extremely well even on crappy pc's like mine. I would give the game a score, but scores are arbitrary so just try the game out.			"

												Long Story short: Yes, I do recommend this game.Why? Read.Short introduction:Star Wars Republic Commando is a rather short FPS where you take the role of a clone Commando-Squad, the ""Delta-Squad"", consisting of four Elite clonetroopers: Boss, the squad leader (which you control), Fixer, the heavy arms guy, Scorch, the guy with the ""l33t hax0r skillz"" (actual quote), and Sev, the Sniper. In the course of the game these four troopers have to fulfill various objectives, such as stopping the Separatists from extracting from Geonosis.Story:As much as I'd like to tell you otherwise: The Story is rather irrelevant. It does help to know the sorroundings just a little, but in the overall game it is irrelevant. That's mostly because the sorroundings have either no effect on the Gameplay or are explained to you when relevant.Sound:I'll quote Wikipedia on this one: ""Republic Commando features a darker and more militaristic soundtrack "" than the rest of Star Wars. What this means is: You can hear that it's Star Wars, it's just adapted to the setting of the game.Regarding the overall sound: The weapons sound authentic, not that it would be hard to make a blaster sound like a blaster, especially heavier weaons, for example the cannons of Republic Assault Ships. Futhermore background noises exist, e.g. the battle on Geonosis and the Fauna on Kashyyyk. Also: The enemies sound like enemies and not just random AI. Why? The Super-Battledroids complain about being hit and some enemy classes keep on complaining about their weapons always being empty. So: breddy gud.Gameplay:Oh boy. Now comes the interesting part.As mentioned before, you control Boss, the squad leader. This means that you can/have to order your squad to do certain things, such as taking position to use a Sniper or planting explosives, so that you can advance to your objective. All this while being overwhelmed by enemy forces, who obviously try to stop you.There are several points to make, though:1. Your squadmates are absolutely loyal. Tell them to revive you while under enemy fire; they'll come to help you, complaining about ""recommended protocols"". Tell them to plant a bomb amidst four to five Super-Battledroids, they'll do, even if they die trying. What does this mean? The AI may not be dumb, but it certainly does not improvise.2. You are always overwhelmed and under pressure. Just like a true SpecOps team.3. No medkits. You can only regenerate health at Bacta-tanks, which are rather rare. You do have a weak energy-shield which stops you from taking damage directly for a few hits, though.4. You are always in dire need of ammo (atleast if you waste as much ammo is I do). Although you can pickup some enemy weapons, you can only pickup one at a time, and that weapon may not be that helpful (e. g. Wookie rocket launcher).Multiplayer: I'll skip this one, as it requires a workaround, because GameSpy is dead.Conclusion: This game is pretty fun, if you can survive a little anger, although I'd recommend buying it on sale, as it it took me only ~3 days-ish to complete.

												its not at all like Star Wars: Battlefront, it may look the same but but its quiite different, insted of just one objective, in Battlefront it was commenly kill all of the enemy troops before they kill you, by the way I'm refering to the old and gold 2005-2006 Battlefronts, not the new mistake. Anyway it is quite a challenge at times, it is in no way a run-n-gun type game, my advise is take your time and think it through, its not an easy game to master but once you have it down, mostly a peice of cake, with a nice chalenge here and there but i think this is a must have for any Star Wars finnatic. If you want more detailed info, we can talk about it on Twitter, find me by @pizza_creeper.			"

												If I had to choose only one Star Wars game to play out of the many out there, this is the one. This game is absolutely amazing. Great squad mechanics, awesome storyline, amazing characters, phenomenal gameplay, everything about this game is the real deal. Playing as a clone commando on the front lines in the clone wars brings a new and fantastic perspective to the Star Wars universe. 10/10 rating. Have played this game's campaign three times and every time I love it more and more.			"

												This is a very fun game. I enjoyed a lot of it. This is a game certainly not for those who get frustrated easily. This game is suprisingly difficult game, even on easy. There needs to be a sequel.Pros-Great graphics for its time, its still decent now.-Great military feel with a good sense of realism due to its practical sound effects and actual military procedures.-Enjoyable squad based gameplay.-More gritty idea of Star Wars. The perspective of the clones gives this game a new perspective of the clone wars-It isn't focused on the star wars ""heroes"" such as Luke Skywalker. It is a nice expansion.-Awesome music.Cons-No multiplayer. If you can get on a sever, which is possible, there is probably no-one there.-Your squad is AI. It is an old game, so it can be forgiven for occasional annoying glitches.-Short campaign.-Cliff hangar ending.			"

												Definitely a fun game, and I'm surprised there's not a sequel for it.  With any luck at all, they'll make one eventually.  I really liked the squad play, as well as the story, short as it was.  The extra commentary from the squad members was awesome, even hilarious at times.I'd really like to give this another playthrough eventually.  There are a couple things that I didn't like about the game, such as blaster rifle accuracy (I swear, I was almost as bad as the stormtroopers in the movies at times lol) and squad AI, but I'm betting those things are more my own fault than anything.  Giving the right orders to the squad for each situation was tricky at times, for me at least, and they died a lot lol.  I certainly think this game would have been far more fun with online multiplayer, if only that functionality was still available in the game.Regardless, it's a fun game either way, and playing single player adds a whole other level of challenge to it.  So if you're a Star Wars and FPS fan, then give this game a try, for sure.  7/10			"

												10/10 Must have for your collection and a must buy if you even are a star wars fan.Do not be fooled by the bad looking screenshots that look meh. The Game is one of the best star wars games out there and lets hope the new battlefront fails so that way they might look at reopening this can of awsomeness. Its well written the Ai for your Team is great.  Great storytelling and making you feel for your fellow clones. Great combat and overall gameplay. Only issues I have are the batttledroids wished they looked more like the movies and that the trandoshins looked like normal, cause Im a huge trandoshin fanboy.Semi SpoilersThough I wont put any heavy spoilers there are no books or anything on wookiepieda that will answer the main question of the ending the main reason is that the main writers or something want to have a story open in case they ever want to come back to delta squad.  Though There are books and such that talk about what happens to delta squad during the days of the empire and such.I recomend to check them out but they dont answer the huge question that we all want answered. Sadly its only fan theroies on what happend nothing solid.			"

												I'ma be honest, its October 2015 and I'm still playing this game, that was made in 2005. Very good squad mechanics, even by todays standards. Very good A.I even by todays standards. Decent graphics ( but give it some slack it is 10 years old). Likeable characters. Short but good story, I personnally love the fact that its much more darker than your normal SW game. All in all great game that can still hold its head high to modern day FPS's 10/10			"

												This game was a blast. It does a very well job at placing you in the shoes of the clone troopers. Actually commanding your troops in battle is confusing at first but really easy to pick up. This is probably the Star Wars game I've ever played. I hope this game gets a modern remaster or the same idea gets used again for future games on current consoles and PC. I didn't use the multiplayer at all. Fun game 10/10.			"
