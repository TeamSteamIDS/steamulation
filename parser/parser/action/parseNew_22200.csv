												Zeno Clash is a beat'em up style fighting game with a dash of first person shooter added into the mix. This game uses Valve's Source engine and was released in April 2009. The xBox got it's version a year later in 2010, but for some reason, got a ""Ultimate Edition"" with content that cannot be accessed on the PC version.  You play as a young warrior named Ghat, and you are on the run from your family as you have accidentally killed your father in an explosion. You have a female companion by the name of Deadra who helps save Ghat along the way. The gameplay is whilst looks like it is a very generic fighting game, it feels different. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but the gameplay seemed a little off to begin with. The tutorial gives a very good introduction into the basics of fighting and dodging, as well as helps you along the way with controls and early combos.  You have the usual quick attacks, powerful attacks, dodges, and blocks as you would expect. Zeno Clash also adds in a little gun combat too, which again, almost feels a little bit off. There is no auto reload on the weapons, which is not always a bad thing, but most fps style games now days at least auto reload once you have emptied your round/clip.  You also cannot fire you run unless you are looking down the scope of it; meaning you will probably end up throwing your weapon around a lot like I did as I was just trying to shoot from the hip. Every level is essentially a fight scene, you have a set amount of opponents which are introduced at the start of each stage, and the aim is to kill them, simples. Zeno Clash has a very good aiming system meaning you can rotate between various different enemies and have the camera automatically face the location they are in. The majority of Zeno Clash's graphics are really top notch; something we should expect from a Source Engine game though. This game is six years old and still looks like a current generation game in my eyes. I played this on a 4K resolution and it looked absolutely stunning (for the most part). Where I ran into a weird graphic problem, was the tutorial. I am not sure whether it was a bug or glitch for me, but the resolution/texture quality/anti aliasing, was absurdly bad on all the tutorial scenes.  I really didn't know what was happening, I went from looking at a stunning 4k rendered world, to something which looks like a SNES has just produced. Like I said, this only happened for me on the tutorial levels, the rest of the game was absolutely fine. Zeno Clash has a good story; one that has a lot of olive branches into a few smaller stories, but focuses on the main story for the majority of the time. The game ends well and will leave you wanting to find out more about the world of Zenozoik (I just love the name of this place!).This game has three levels of difficulty; I played on normal and had a sufficiently challenging playthrough, there are no points which had me running against a brick wall for hours - I had to retry a couple of times. I can see the harder difficulty to be a real challenge though, since the handicap fights can get real hectic if you don't keep track on where all of your enemies are at ALL times - you will end up getting your head beat in from behind and you won't even realize. A full playthrough of Zeno Clash's story mode took me just about five hours; the rest of the time I spent in the challenge mode, which allows you to climb a tower and have your scores ranked every time you beat the final boss. In total I got about fourteen hours worth of gameplay out of it, so for £6,99, I am very happy with that outcome. Other than the strange graphical glitches I had on the tutorial modes; I did experience a few crashes. This came from when trying to use anything related to the Steam Overlay such as screenshots, or shift+tabbing to bring up your friends list whilst in game; this instantly crashed me to the desktop. The game also doesn't have a manual save function, so you are relying heavily on the auto save feature. Normally when I am playing a game which I have experienced crashes on, I try to save as often as I can, so when I found out I couldn't manually saved, it made me very cautious and was often on edge hoping for it not to crash, which somewhat spoiled the experience for me.  I also had a problem where the game would not count any of my achievements,  whether this is because of the issue with the Steam Overlay or not - I'm not sure. To sum up; I will recommend Zeno Clash as a very good PC game; it's standing the test of time very well, has some very nice graphics, a compelling story line and decent gameplay. If you don't experience any crashes or bugs, then you will have yourself a welcome addition to your Steam library in this game. If you can't really overlook the issues; then this may be one of the only times I say to try the console version out since that sounds like it is virtually bug free. Thankfully Steam does have a demo up for this game, so you can try it out first before purchasing - which is something I would highly recommend you do.

xeno- prefix. from Ancient Greek ξένος (ksénos, “alien”) a. Having to do with foreigners, as in xenophilia, or more commonly, xenophobia. b. From a foreign place, as in xenolith.clash noun. onomatopoeic a. A skirmish, a hostile encounter. b. Opposition, contradiction, such as between differing or contending interests, views, purposes etc.In my imagination, the development of Xeno-- sorry, Zeno Clash -- started when folks at Ace Team got together, got high, and got onto the subject of ancient mythologies (Roman, Greek, Norse, etc.) and how weird they all were. I mean, if you want crazy characters and crazier stories, you need look no further than some of the gods and goddesses traipsing around back in the day. Athena, birthed fully formed out of the sweaty forehead of Zeus; Pan, the goat-god of wanton sex; Artemis, goddess of the hunt, who for some reason was depicted in various interpretations as being literally covered with breasts; Medusa, she of the stylish snake perm and stony gaze, being some kind of metaphor for psychosexual wackiness (I'm pretty sure we can blame Freud for that); Jeff, the God of Biscuits; and even some nutter who told people to eat some bread and drink some wine and pretend it was his flesh and his blood... I mean, ew, dude. I'm sure we have enough problems without adding cannibalism to it. So anyway, the developers were shooting the breeze about Gods and Golden Fleece and rivers of blood and whatever until one guy, as I imagine it, stood up and went, ""Yeah... but like, what if... Dude! What if there were, like, aliens, right? And they were weird, like totally, heh, but then, like, THEY also had myths and♥♥♥♥♥♥ I mean... dude...""So that's where this game comes from, more or less. There is a distinct dreamlike quality inherent in the stories of myth, fantastical and larger than life, and that is the feeling you get as you find your way through the land of Zenozoik. It feels deliciously alien and new, in the visuals and in the story (neither of which go out of their way to make a lot of sense, but it's still easy enough to follow). You'll see and hear a lot of weird stuff, and sooner or later, you just go with the flow because it's weirdly seductive. Even running on the old Source engine, and looking a bit dated now in 2015, the art and design and imagination of the dev team comes through in nearly every area so that you will truly think you are in fact running around on an impossibly, impossibly alien world. Luckily, they do at least have one thing in common with us here on Earth: they really like punching the stuffing out of each other.If you've seen anything about Zeno Clash you already know the basics: it's a first-person brawler-shooter. Way more emphasis on the brawling than the shooting, thankfully. You, a fugitive on the run, have a modest set of fighting moves at your disposal, such as light and strong punches, blocks, dodges, counterattacks, grabs and throws. Unfortunately, so do your opponents for the most part, although they will also attack you at range if they get a chance. You get a small selection of weapons yourself, and they come in handy once in a while but the majority of your combat will be served in knuckle sandwiches. And they were never so tasty: combat feels fantastic in this game. It's fun, responsive and fast, with a good amount of variety (though there could be more), and it's super satisfying to land an uppercut on some chump and watch him go flying. I didn't really think I'd enjoy such a melee-focused FPS but after playing this I stand corrected, it's ridiculously fun. I even enjoyed the few bits where you are required to tote a rifle or another firearm, although I am glad those bits were few. They're not bad, really -- the rifle in particular sounds great, and it's amusing to plunk away at dudes with the double-fisted handguns -- but save for a couple spots you won't really get that much of a chance to use them because enemies will do their best to rush you if you're shooting at them, and none of the weapons are viable at close quarters.One thing you will notice right off the bat is the voice acting, and it is... hmm. How to describe it. Well, your first impression will probably be ""Oh my god this is bad."" And you wouldn't really be wrong, especially with regards to the main character. He is, let's say, from the same acting school as Christopher Walken and William Shatner, only he flunked out hard. His lines are awkwardly paced, and weirdly inexpressive; he speaks in a stilted, matter-of-fact tone. All of that might turn you off -- which is why I'm mentioning it -- but honestly, his weirdness actually fits the game very well. There is often dialogue that sounds so insane on paper, but because of the way he delivers his lines, it instead sounds believable and ordinary, which makes the bizarre setting of the game even more bizarre. All in all, it works for me. It may not work for you.It's not a very long game (ignore my obscenely long playtime), but it's a fully-formed, enjoyable, weird as all hell story that will have you doing at least one or two double-takes because you have probably never heard sentences like these in a game before. The fighting is hard and fast and so enjoyable, the world is filled with delicious weirdness for your eyes, and the trusty Source engine shines through even for a six year old game. I don't know about you, but it absolutely charmed the pants off me with how little Ace Team cared for making the ""right"" game, and made a fun, unique, and beautifully bizarre one instead.			"

												+ Combat system is incredibly simple and satisfying; everything connects and feels right, making this the game's greatest strength+ Character designs are creative and interesting; just the right mixture of weird and entertaining+ Strange weapon designs; very original in every respect (if you've seen the 1999 film ExistenZ, imagine the chicken bone gun, and populate an entire game-world with the same concept)+ Control scheme is efficient, and every button-press felt natural and satisfying+ Strange, yet appropriate soundtrack; did well to set the mood and keep you feeling mildly unsettled+ Atmospheric elements worked well with the environmental set-pieces to make for an absolutely bizarre world; I must say that this level of creativity, while unconventional, was a breath of fresh air+ Challenging, adaptive AI; enemies really keep you on your toes in the best possible way (save for a few, minor shortcomings - some of the bosses are also a bit too easy to cheese)- Terrible voice-acting- Stiff, clumsy animations- Frustrating and unnecessary lock-on system- Save for a (rather dull) Challenge Mode, and the ability to unlock cheat codes for the campaign, this title has virtually no replay value- Largely weak sound effects- Poorly explained, muddled plot with little character development and too many answers left out (topped off with a mediocre cliffhanger)LockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												Truly a masterpiece. Fight your way to the truth of an unhinged world through mobsters, monsters, deranged beings and dark creatures.Zenozoik is a wonderful, vivid world, but this is no paradise. Forget the tales about the 'good savage', for this land is full of secrets and violence. Find out the reason of the brutal hunting you suffer from your own brothers, the secret crimes Ghat has come to know. In this first journey in Zenozoik, there'll be some revelations, but also questions that'll make you wish everything hidden to be brought into the open. The world ACE Team has created is really unique, and you'll always feel that there's much more to see... and to fight. Because Zeno Clash is above all, a brawling game, and it excels on it. The extraordinary plot backs an addictive and satisfying combat system, and luckyly the game includes modes beyond the main history which will sate your thirst for beating throwing you right into the action, in the increasingly harder stages of a tower which progressive destruction will delight you by its smart use of physics. Zeno Clash is an indispensable, which will remind you why some games deserve to be considered art; exalted visuals, surprising lore and relentless fights await you. Welcome to Zenozoik, brother.			"

												8/10Strong fantasy appeal.  The world and story is of new mythology.  Fighting system is challenging, fun, annoying, and very immersive.  For the most part the game is moderate difficulty from beginning to end.  Some of the fights can be easily beaten once you find a weakness in the A.I. or level design.  The game favors freaks who love originality.  The short length was perfect for the story.  Because it is a short game I would reccomend getting it on sale.  Overall a very enjoyable experience.  I have gained a number of concepts and ideas that will occupy my daydreams for the next month or so. I will be getting Zeno Clash 2 next time it is on sale.[If you are having problems with the fighting system then wait a few months and come back to it.  Start the game over and try again.  Worked for me.]			"

												This game is a strange ,unique and most of all a fun to play game. The first person view combat was a new experience to me and I really liked it. Although, the game felt a bit short than I was expecting. And the plot seems a bit in-complete. The additional challenge modes are fun as well. And best of all it is well optimized for my low end pc, which all source engine games do. The game is totally worth it and I will rate it a 8/10.			"

TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Zeno Clash is a first-person melee fighting game developed by ACE Team using Valve's famous Source Engine and released on Steam back in 2009.The story begins with Ghat, the game's protagonist, waking up after being knocked out by an explosion which killed a creature known as Father-Mother who is the leader of a very powerful mafia like family in the small town of Halstedom. The protagonist Ghat is presumably one of Father-Mother's children who turned rogue and ran away from home and is now being pursued by his 'brothers and sisters' (enforcers of Father-Mother). Join him and his companion Deadra in a quest to discover the truth of about Ghat's past and trace back the series of events that led to the explosion.PROS:+ Excellent use of the Source Engine+ Good fisticuffs (melee) combat mechanic+ Surreal world and environment+ Complex but enjoyable story+ Interesting character, item and monster designs+ Item variety+ Good sound effects and voice acting+ The Devs were probably high during this game's production+ Challenging difficultiesCONS:- Extremely short (4-5 hours game time in my last playthrough)- Almost no replay value (except for the tower challenge mode)- Difficult learning curve- Story is a bit difficult to follow- Short linear levels (In my opinion, linear games are fine as long as the levels are lengthy and enjoyable)- No character progression (no armors, level ups or item upgrades)CONCLUSION:GOOD GAME. Zeno Clash sports a very unique art style that places you in a very surreal world with a strange geography and is populated by strange creatures all brought to life by the developer's clever use of Valve's Source Engine. The combat mechanics is fun albeit a little frustrating at times and hard to learn however, the items does give variety to the player's fighting style. The game should provide you with at least 4-5 hours of game time with its campaign with an added 'Tower Challenge' if the player wants to test his skills.I RECOMMEND this game mostly for the experience but the short game time could be an issue, still though, Zeno Clash is a fun game to play. I can't honestly cannot recommend it at full price (even if it is only $10 or your regional equivalent), so getting it on a sale is probably a better idea.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												This game has vivid and imaginative visuals going for it.But is otherwise let down by a boring, uninspiring and pretentiously written story.That and the game is a chore to play, with little satisfaction to be had from vanquishing your foes. The tedious fights feel like a punishment and distraction from the not as unpleasant cut-scenes.It's worth a look for its originality but has little redeeming value otherwise.			"

												Zeno Clash is a bit short compared to most single-player games, and the gameplay mechanics can feel a bit limiting at times, but there is something about this game to which I am drawn.The excerpt from the IGN review about it feeling ""refreshingly original and completely compelling"" is 100% on the mark. Zeno Clash has a great story and is more than worth the $1 it tends to go on sale for during each of the past few big Steam sales at the time of this writing (Autumn Sale 2013). "

												I had no idea what the hell I was doing, but I beat it, somehow.It's relatively short, but the world is alien in both a good and a bad way. Some of the designs are awesome, funny and nice, others are just plain ugly and it doesn't always fit together. But I guess that's what makes Zeno Clash the game it is: Awkward and fun, much less than it could have been. An incredibly inventive universe only lightly touched by it's weird little storyline.I recommend Zeno Clash for anyone looking for an intriguing brief experience, or people with a thing for tattoo'd on moustaches.

Pros:-Combat is very unique and fun-Art style- An additional ""tower climb"" challange mode if you want.Cons:-Very linear-There is a ""lock on"" mechanic in the game that happens when you fight an enemy. This can be disengaged manually, but can get a bit annoying when it comes to fighting 3+ people are once.- There was one instance where i had to reload the level because it got bugged. Nothing major and it only took me about 5 minutes to make it up.Neutral:-It is short - like 3-4 hours.			"

												Very strange, to be honest, I thought someone dosed me with something, I had to ask and confirm with other people that this game was real. The gameplay at its heart is a first person brawler, with a healthy mix up of shooting here and there. but the story, woa ho ho.... man. imagine a world that was generations deep with inbreeding, as well as cross breeding with chickens and pigs, and not the cute jrpg way, but more of a demented master blaster way. This is the world you're going to get into with this game.I did not like the melee combat at first, but the story kept me playing, and I ended up finding that the parry hit and run knee to the face smash tactics to be, well....... really good. and by the end of the game I found myself actually wanting to toss my guns down and put my fists up. It's short, but left me satisfied. I hope we see more of this twisted world.			"

												  Zeno Clash is a wierd game that tries to, and succeeds at, doing something that no other FPS has done.  The story is strange, the characters are mysterious, and the player is left continuously wondering what will happen next.  Unfortunately, the story is also not interesting. The game just throws disparate scenario after scenario at you presented as a series of events that happened before the beginning of the game, and it leaves it largely up to you to connect these events.  The characters are not expanded upon, the enemies are only briefly expounded on, and the main characters motivations are left entirely unclear.  I believe this was a choice made deliberately to add mystery to the story, but for me it only left me wanting for a clear reason to continue to my goal.  None of this would be a problem if the game was fun.  I don't need a reason to complete the game if I enjoy playing it.  Zeno Clash is unique in that it tries to blend melee and ranged combat in an FPS in a way I've never seen before.  The melee portion includes blocking, counter attacks, dodging, grabs, and other staples of good melee combat.  The mechanics of the game is what brings it down in this respect.  It would take a long time to describe exactly how frustrating it is to control the combat, but I frequently ended up performing the wrong defensive move which would result in my taking damage.  Furthermore, the counterattacks don't work.  Almost every time I tried to counter an enemy they would block or dodge my counterattack.  The ranged combat has similar problems.  Guns are not meant to be used exclusively.  You are supposed to pick up a weapon and shoot an enemy as many times as you can until they get close to you.  This part feels good.  Watching an enemy running towards you, it feels great to score those two big hits that send them flying on their back then pelting them with more shots until they start towards you again.  When they start getting closer though is when the frustration begins.  When an enemy gets close, you are meant to lock on to put away your weapon and begin melee.  However, running away from an enemy breaks your lock, so if you are trying to get away, the gun comes back out.  If you are hit with the gun out, it drops to the ground with whatever ammo it had, where enemies can pick it up and use it against you.  In short, again, the mechanincs of this game make it very frustrating to do what you want to do, and to fight multiple enemies.  In conclusion, I wanted to like this game.  I like wierd games, I like difficult games, and I like story-driven games.  I HATE frustrating games, however, and this falls squarely into that last category.  The mechanincs of combat don't work, the story was not holding my interest, and I felt no reason to complete the game.  In addition, I found a Zeno Clash process running in the background of my PC even though I hadn't played the game in days and the game itself was not running, so my hours played are inflated.  I should note I did not finish this game.			"

												Zeno clash is probably one of the more memorable games I've played this year. Set in one of the most creative worlds I have ever witnessed, this game stands out as a real gem to me.+Well-developed melee fighting where you can lash together combos, strike quickly or strongly, or pick a median attack. Blocking, dodging, countering, finishing. Many great moves to help you deal with the situation at hand.+Ranged weapons that work fairly well from dual-wielded pistols, rifles, crossbows, or 'grenade launchers'. All very imaginatively designed in a way that they're nothing like you'd imagine based upon how I just described them. Unfortunately they make some fights a little too easy, but without them those same fights would have been a bit too hard.+It's challenging, but not unfair. Many games today are either too easy, or designed unfairly to promote difficulty. Zeno clash is almost the perfect median between the two.+The voice acting for the characters is simply splended. Every voice actor was given strange roles to fit, very specific roles, and they all nailed them with excellence. +Great and memorable characters. From the moral-less Ghat, to the kind and caring Deadra, to the mysterious Father-Mother and all of his-her sons and daughters you face throughout the game. To the also-mysterious Golem, and even to the many unique Corwid you face throughout the game. Oxameter and Gabel being the most memorable.+The story is confusing to begin with, but as you progress and learn more about what's happening it is fantastic. Absolutely great. Unfortunately it ends in a bit of a cliff hanger but that's fine! We have a sequel available to us! +The world is simply stunning. The setting is so unique and refreshing, I just want to experience more and more of it. Give me more!+The music fits the game so well! Matching every moment almost perfectly! Well-arranged tracks as well.+A challenge mode to keep you entertained after you beat the main story, which is well needed since....-I finished the game in a little over 3 hours. And the challenge mode will keep you busy for about one extra hour, which is nice.I give this game a solid 9/10. How short it is is what holds it back from its full potential, but this is a game no one should miss. Definitely pick this one up as soon as possible!			"

												Awkward controls, laughably bad voice acting, and atrociously lacking amount of customization and modability.It has a unique art style and interesting story, but nothing makes up for quite how ODD the game feels on so many levels, and the ending really isn't quite worth it. Might consider it on sale, but even then there are other things more worth your time.All in all, this game provides a good showcase of why first person brawlers don't tend to be produced much.			"

												I'm trying to think of the best way to advise somebody just now picking this game up, whether by random choice or under pressure from their friends. Of course, the latter will probably result in disappointment. Don't let the buzzwords (quirky, awkward, weird, crazy) fool you. The game is (though I loath to use this term) ""quirky,"" to be sure, the story and voice work have an awkward, disjointed feel, as does the game's art style. Trust me when I say this is all intentional on the part of the devs, and isn't just a pointless dive at becoming the strangest thing since Vangers.If you have ever been told this game is ""deep,"" it's because of the revelations of the sequel, Zeno Clash 2. Anyone suggesting you play the first part of a series because of how much THEY enjoyed the revelations of the second part is like someone watching Return of the King, going bananas over the charge of the Rohirim and suggesting you pick up the extended edition of Fellowship when you have no experience with LOTR whatsoever. You will not enjoy it. PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT ANY EXPECTATIONS WHATSOEVER. Ignore the exaltations of your peers.As for how ""quirky"" and ""awkward"" this game is, like I said, it's intentional. There's a suitable comparison in the 1984 movie Scanners. The protagonist is a man who has been mute his entire life, and suddenly regains the power of speech. It's not very well elaborated upon in the film, but his social skills and speech patterns are completely out of whack because of this: he has to develope these skills almost from the ground up. The people who inhabit the world of Zeno Clash have a similar problem, which is elaborated upon in the sequel; again, perhaps explaining why people think this game is so ""deep.""Gameplay is fairly simple and quite challenging. First person hand-to-hand is a very peculiar form of gameplay, particularly when it's as complicated as it is in both Zeno Clash 1 and 2. Though there is a limited variety of enemies, they all have unique fighting styles which you will have to adapt to in order to succeed. Enemies will fake you out, surprise you with the reach of their attacks, suddenly overwhelm you with a flurry of blows; to this day, whenever I pick up Zeno Clash I'm regularly intimidated and surprised by the combat, in spite of having played through the game multiple times. It's no surprise that some players are frustrated by how unpredictable it is and even reject the game entirely, dismissing it as quirky nonsense. Trust me, just have patience and work on your timing. Pick some good battle music and play the tower challenges. You'll probably find it as enjoyable and satisfying as I do.			"

												Zeno Clash is a very strange game with a great atmosphere. It's hard to describe how the game presents itself; you'll have to see it to understand it. Because of its modest price tag, this is definitely worth checking out for everyone who appreciates an action packed and strange experience or someone who is looking for something original. It's only a shame it's such a short experience.You'll either love it or hate it. If you can let the bizarre world and characters entice you, you will get your money's worth. Its flawed gameplay will annoy most people though. If you're open-minded, you might appreciate this unique experience.Zeno Clash is a marvel, channeling yesterday’s hardcore brawlers whilst maintaining modern sensibilities.Zeno Clash demonstrates why often the most Bizarre projects can only be developed by independent companies. No “major” could ever do something like this, and that’s because we are talking about one of the most suggestive and atypical titles of recent times.Despite the initial weirdness and a few flaws, Zeno Clash is a unique take on first-person fighting that anyone with an open mind will likely enjoy.Overall 7/10.

												If there ever was an award for weirdest world, Zeno Clash would be a top contender. The game starts with you killing your Father-Mother(Which is a single entity) under suspicious circumstances and it doesn't slow down from there as you progress both further away, running from your brothers and sisters, and back to the start, through flashbacks explaining how you came to kill your Father-Mother. At no point does Zeno Clash attempt to make excuses for it's insane universe, no explanation is given for anything that does not fit within the games context, things simply are.Some will love this and some will hate it but either way you can't help but admire the writers for making such an uncompromising world that gives you one WTF? moment after the other with barely a second to catch your breath.The gameplay is simplistic repetitive beat-em-up not worth mentioning but the game should be played, if only to experience the madding world of Zeno Clash, whose like you won't find anywhere else.

												Zeno Clash is truly a masterpiece. It’s an uncommonly strange and bizarre first-person beat ‘em up game set in a punk fantasy world. This game has a deep and compelling story. It's filled with very interesting and surreal characters and environments, which make this game an unforgettable experience.			"

												It's safe to say that Zeno Clash wouldn't work as a big budget game from an established studio; it's far too different from convention, which would mean it's far too risky a project for them. But it's a perfect example of how some of the best and most original ideas are coming out of independent teams that have talent and passion and can take risk because they're not gambling with tens of millions of dollars. Zeno Clash sticks with you long after you play it, and that's a compliment many games aspire to have associated with them.			"

												What the heck is Zeno Clash?Zeno clash is a first person bang em up type game where the player can punch or kick the crap out of his opponents. Seems like simple fun arcade stuff right? Sort of is, but there are added features to the game (beside the campaign) that make it significant. The storyline is a good one to say the least. There is a guy who trains you in the game and by the time he's done training you, he simply kills himself. This game is whacky, weird, and odd, but how it all comes together within the world is awesome. When people speak about creative games, this one definitely takes the cake with it's outrageous characters. Besides the game play, the characters alone will make you double take. They are given personalities with extreme oddity that simply makes it appealing. I fought a boss who jumped on top of a bunch of dinosaurs while trying to kill me for pete's sake. I really like the fighting engine and the added features of being able to pick up guns, crossbows, and other sort of crazy weaponry like blunt objects that send opponents flying. When you fight, it actually feels like you're making contact with the opponent. The feedback in the punches was done phenomenally. Should you buy it? On sale I would say unless you REALLY like these types of games.For future Zeno Clash games I would recommend multiplayer, and maybe even dare to try to incorporate local co-op. To add to the fighting, perhaps add kicks or even allow for players to hold down the mouse button, then use the mouse to swing to determine the type of swing. Don't make it to the point where people start snapping their mouse cord, but something decently close enough.RATING : 8.2/10get's an extra .2 for being a breakaway new type of genre.Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign A- Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B- Overall  B "

												A short, but action packed journey in a unique world.You are on the run, hunted by your own family for the murder of your own father - or better - Father-Mother, aided only by the young woman by your side.The story is split in two parallel storylines: your present and your past, which will unfold via flashbacks, as you narrate your past and motives to your only remaining friend, and will take you to the very end of the world, before you decide to return home to settle your past once and for all.Gameplay-wise, the combat in this game is praised as one of the best melee combat experiences in gaming, and while I don't fully agree, I certainly see how it may be so for many people.You will find an immersive first person combat system, where every punch and every block counts, and mostly, FEELS right.In the end, it is a short story of ideals and revelations that may even manage to make you think of society as we see it.Hard to recommend to everyone, although it is so short (I completed it in 5h and I'm sure it can be completed in a little less) that even those who simply seek an alternative adventure won't be too weighed down. I do recommend it, however, to first person brawlers' fans, you will be given every tool to test your fighting skills.In short: short, first person brawler with excellent, fleshed out combat and a story with a morale set in a bizarre world.

												I mainly knew about ACE team because of the incredibly impressive Batman Doom, but I was surprised they were a commercial studio. I was definitely not disappointed in their first commercial effort. Simple, effective gameplay and visuals that feel straight out of Heavy Metal. First person brawlers need a much bigger presence. I've played an hour and a half but I'm halfway through the game. The simplicity makes up for the length though, and it feels like it can offer more replay in return. Don't bother complaining about it, you probably have more games in your Steam account than you can finish in your lifetime anyways. Be thankful you're not getting a 50 hour timesink that you'll put off playing forever because of the daunting length.			"

												I'm going to give the controversial opinion and say that I didn't really enjoy this game.The first person combat is amazing, yes. I love the way that the first person fighting mechanics feel. But the story just could not hold my interest.The world you are put in is such an interesting and creative one, yet the plot is so jointed and disconnected that I never felt like I got to know the world very well. The story and plot was just too confusing for me to understand. Many aspects just felt unexplained, and the game ends on a sequel hook cliffhanger.Is the game worth trying? Sure. But personally? I felt the confusing story made the game drag on far too long.			"

												Maybe you watched The Dark Crystal and thought, ""Man, I sure would like to beat the $&!? out of everyone and everything in this world!"" This is pretty close. It's like, ""The Dark Crystal... Meth"".First person boxing and melee that mostly works with some ranged weapons thrown in. An older source engine game, the effects (lighting, atmosphere, reflections) look nice but not amazing. The art design itself is wildly creative and a highlight of the experience. The gameplay is not perfect, sometimes it can be frustrating because of the targeting mechanic (you lock on an opponent then need to unlock to regroup effectively), but it was actually quite satisfying overall. Some good brawls and decent variety, and when you need a weapon, it'll be there.The story is the stuff of dark fairy tales and myth. It is pretty weird and told with flashbacks that roll into the present. But it makes sense, in a dreamy sort of way. The voice acting is solid. Just don't expect a lot of character depth or the option to interact with anyone in any way besides pummeling the holy $&!? out of them. Not a very long game, Zeno Clash has a challenge ladder if you wanna fight some more.  I'd actually say it was a good length because it didn't get boring. The hand to hand combat combined with the great weird visuals makes this a pretty good buy for $10, or a great buy for .99 cents. Looking forward to Zeno Clash 2 :)

												Zeno Clash is weird. There's something not quite right about this game, but I still had a lot of fun playing it. There are many bizarre creatures and an unsettling storyline to back them up. I think this game was made just unique enough to stand out, but it's still too weird to love. Zeno Clash, metaphorically speaking, has a face that only a (giant hideous monster) mother could love. It's worth playing, but you've been warned.			"

I have got to say its a great story even if it does feel a little minimalist. The characters and environments are just lovely!

Check the (#) point at the end.Glitches / bugs At least one. Check the (*) point at the end.Worth price It can deserve its full price if you really love the game. I suggest to get it discounted though.- Review below ----------------------------------------------------------------------Zeno Clash is a unique game in its genre : a first person fighter - beat-them-all set in a tribal punk fantasy world. You play as Ghat all along his journey exiled from his tribe through the end of the world. Helped by his sister he will face many opponents and dangers to survive along his exile : that will includes many brothers and sisters of his own Father-Mother (an hermaphrodite creature) as well as a hired head-hunter, the Corwid of the Free's tribe and many critters.But Ghat isn't weak at all, quite the contrary, he is really strong despite his thin shape. He also learned how-to fight with Metamoq the chief of Corwid of the Free. So he knows how to fight using his fists or melee or gun weapons.The game features levels, meaning that there is no at lot to explore but there are many brawls and fights to come through. Despite that, there are many new environments and concepts to make the game quite interesting. Also each level are independent meaning that weapons you had at the end of a level won't be transferred to the next level. (Unless the bombs are but I'm not sure) So as you understood each level as its own weapons, enemies and fruits in specific places. The game consists in exploring (a little) and fighting/brawling waves of foes and bosses. The HUD is very simple : you got your own portrait with your health and stamina bars. Every time you run or prepare a strong attack you use stamina which will be restored slowly. And don't be afraid for your health bar running low, there are always some fruits that give you some health back as well as some checkpoint that restore you whole health ! The HUD show you also the remaining bombs you got.Adding to the story mode there is also a challenge mode. Challenges take place in a tower, split in two area : the top and the bottom. If you are going in the top you are going to fight many foes on each level using the given weapons or not (you can brawl instead most of the time) to reach the top level which include the story boss as well as many foes at the same time ! If you are going at the bottom, you'll need to fight foes and make you way below by jumping platform by platform using bombs if needed to break a whole platform to make a hole. But don't forget to take care of every foe cause you won't go deeper until you dealt with all of them. So you can push them all in the pit below but you'll need to face all the survivors at the end. Also when you'll go deeper you'll encounter golden enemies which are more powerful and tougher. Each level can be played independently so it's not a real survival game. At the end of each challenge you'll be in the leaderboard with the time you've made and the remaining health. So you can compete with your friends on steam.That's not all : you have also 70 Zeno Clash characters and foes patterns for Garry's Mod.I would really recommend this game !(*): A very uncommon issue happened to me in the Corvid of the Free forest : after I've beat up every foe the game keep playing without occurring the next wave. But after waiting / moving several minutes the next wave appeared.(#): I would say almost every achievement can be backtracked and several of them are kept while making another playthrough or replaying some levels. Only one ""difficult"" achievement requires you to play the whole story from the beginning to the end using weapons when you really need to. There are a lot of information on steam or elsewhere that explains when you need to use weapons or not. If you used one by mistake you can still kill yourself and try the current level but if you forgot to this playthrough will not count.			"

												First person games with good melee combat are sadly rare.  Too often it basically consists of flailing your arms with no force feedback until the enemy falls over (see Elder Scrolls).  Which is a a shame, because when these types of games do show up, they tend to be pretty awesome.As you can guess, Zeno Clash has good melee combat.  It's fairly simple, but it feels good.  You can dodge and block, punch and throw to your heart's content.  My only real complaint about the combat is that at times it feels a little barebones, especially because the game doesn't force you into most advanced techniques.  I rarely dodged or blocked in my playthrough (although I have yet to do the tower challenges).The melee segments are broken up by time with various other weapons, and a few boss battles.  I often found myself wishing I could go back to the melee combat (especially during the repetitive fights with heavy enemies), but even these segments were mildly enjoyable at worst and fun at best.The game also has a pretty good story.  It's simple and short, but it's supported by a wonderfully strange world, and it's fairly engaging.  It ends poorly though, with barely any sense of conclusion.  The game ends up feeling like a prologue for the sequel.All in all it's a very solid game.  Good melee combat, great world, fun variety of segments.  It's definitely not perfect: It's very short, and it's basically a series of scenes with fades between so it feels at times disjointed and restricting, but it's an enjoyable game, and worth playing if you like unique games or just want to beat up a bunch of weird creatures.

												absurdism is difficult. that which is otherworldly, that which is abstract understanding, can only stem from relations of relations of corrupted understandings. people gravitate toward things far removed from understanding. people talk and caw about games having disparate worlds, but zeno clash is true. zeno clash features a world so far removed from anything in fiction or in living. its an absolute triumph of visual direction. zeno clash is a textbook on the deranged. with all of my praise though, it does remind one distinctly of oddworld. however, zeno clash’s world is much more lively - less barren to say - and there are many humans. though there are many other creatures as well.whatever zeno clash ended up looking like, the base idea is something I would sell myself off for. I am incredibly glad this game exists. beat ‘em ups are eternal for me. what rings incredibly true for zeno clash is how traditional it is. you fight with two kinds of punches, light and heavy. a light punch can strike up to three times and can be comboed into a strong. strong punches are kind of like a wind up punch; space yourself away from your target and dash in with your fist. both are incredibly satisfying thanks to impeccable animation and hit detection. if an enemy becomes dazed, they can be thrown. and that’s basically it. the basic tendency calls back the roots of the beat ‘em up genre, a very comfortable thing for me, and a very different trace of influence for a modern game. especially considering the direction beat ‘em ups have taken with devil may cry, ninja gaiden, and god of war - although those are fantastic titles - it’s nice to see a game toning things back. except, I’d probably enjoy a hyper-complex combat system more, in all honesty.if zeno clashed revolved around limited arena battles punching the trash out of fugly foes, and in saying that it does anyway, then it’d be a fantastic game that anyone looking for new ideas in their vidcons should play. it wouldn’t raise any intellectual hell, but exist as something more primal than serious sam, with an even goofier atmosphere. the boxing arenas are still totally worth it. but what was a successful formula gets bogged down by forced variance. ace team wasn’t content with the gold they struck - or maybe the gold was struck from altering their original first person shooter formula?

												'Zeno Clash' is a debut game by ACE Team, who are the developers who recently released 'Rock of Ages'.This is an impressive title. Extraordinarily impressive. An FPS focusing mostly on brawling and few weapon mechanics, the gameplay is not only innovative, but stunningly creative and chocked full of potential. The imagination used to create this game is off the charts: it's a cornucopia of color and design. ACE has left no stone unturned when  creating an entirely new world. Not only do they focus on the visuals of the planet but also the unique culture, technology, wildlife, language and the natives that inhabit this strange new land. When it comes to being engulfed in a whole new reality, I've seen few games do it as seamlessly as 'Zeno Clash'.While the gameplay is unvaried and by no means perfect, this reasonably short foray leaves you wanting MORE. For 'Zeno Clash', this is a good thing. This is one game that will have you chomping at the bit for a sequel.			"

												It is truly dificult to put this game into words. I will say this now: If you like strange games, this may be a big hit for you. The playstyle was rather interesting with a first-person fist fighting game mingles with shooting mechanics as well. It has a decent enough story, considering how short it is, but it could do a bit better. The art is really the best part of this game, it is extremely unique with a tribal-apocalypse thing going. Overall it is pretty fun to play as well, and is just short enough that right as it begins to feel repetitious, it ends. You could do a lot worse than Zeno Clash if you are aiming to kill a few hours on a weekend or something.			"

												TLDRPro's-Good story-Neat characters-Good combat mechanicsCon's-Real Short-No replay value-Older graphics (not really a con)Well for starters it holds up pretty well for a 2009 game. Graphics and audio settings are outdated. But it still looks pretty good. I beat the game in about 3 hours (without encountering any glitches) and then played some of the challenges.The game takes place in a really strange world filled with all sorts of creatures and characters and not a lot of backstory. The campaign flip-flops with a normal mission and then a flashback mission as you figure out things and the story is told.The gameplay is a solid mix of hand-to-hand combat with some ranged weapons and larger enemies/special fights. It got slightly boring and repetitive because you fight the same characters over and over throughout the campaign. BUT the story is interesting enough for me to enjoy the slightly repetitive fighting. After the campaign there isnt much replay value other than a few easter eggs and achievments. However there are  combat challenges that offer some extra content. I didn't finish all of them but someone that absolutely loves the game would.All around its a solid game, i'm not sure i'd pay more than $5 for it. A great outcome from such a small studio7/10			"

												Gameplay:You can normal punch, strong punch, block and dodge. You can also do some advanced techniques like a super strong punch, a rushed elbow hit, and if you block then press your normal punch or strong punch button you can land a devastating quick kick. It's pretty simple. There are also weapons that have a small ""magazine"" (the best gun I found had 3 shots before I had to reload). You mostly walk in a straight line.  It is kind of dreamlike because even though it is linear many of the things from point A to B are cut out. For example in one part you are in the forest and then 5 minutes later (after a fight) you are in the coast. The gameplay is simple but fun.Story:Without giving too much away: Ghat murders Father-Mother (the name implies everything). He is on the run and his girlfriend (Deadra) tags along cause I don’t know. You get many flashbacks that tell more of the story and you try to piece it together. He refuses to tell his girlfriend Father-Mother's secret (why he killed it). This game is kind of weird. See a couple of the screenshots and you will see what I mean. The world looks twisted and colorful as do the characters. People are weird and some talk in riddles. You definitely will be laughing at some points in the game.Definitely get it. The story mode is short but you also get a challenge mode. I believe there is an SDK for this game but I haven’t come across any mods.			"

												Zeno Clash is a First Person ""Brawler"" by Chilean developer ACE Team. Made in the Source Engine, Zeno Clash is nothing but oozing in creativity. From the zany monster design to the intriguing weapons, the game creates an original setting the likes of which are not often seen amongst games these days. Although I mentioned weapons earlier, the meat of the games combat comes from the brawling segments. Through the usage of a stamina bar and several combos and counters, Zeno Clash attempts to be a first person fist-fighting game. In this it succeeds, though it will take some time to get used to the combat. It draws certain parallels to Dark Souls almost: both games have heavy and light attacks, blocking, and parrying. The games does so many things right such as introducing all fights with cool illustrations of the foes and breaking up the gameplay with various weapons, boss fights and changes of locale, that it doesn't fall hard to forgive it for its biggest flaw, namely voice acting. It being an Indie game and all it's not hard to understand why the voice acting might be less than stellar, but its a minor point that shouldn't impede anyone's enjoyment of the game. Zeno Clash is, among other things a first person brawler done right with one of the best fantasy settings in modern games.			"

												What a strange game this is. Zeno Clash's dialogue, artstyle, characters and environments are all unique and work well together to tell a short, but interesting story. A lot of it doesnt make any sense in the beginning, but I think that just adds to the experience. Combat is a very strong aspect in Zeno Clash. It is a first person brawler with bits of shooting thrown in. The bulk of the combat will be punching and kicking the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everybody. It can get to be challenging once more enemies get in it with you. Mastering the block and parry system can be difficult, but it will definitely be rewarding, since a sucessful bloack/parry combo can send an enemy flying across the screen. Theres nothing more satisfying than being able to do that. Also, you can kick the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of people while theyre on the ground. That feels good too.			"

												A first-person beat'em up game at it's finest! The world of Zeno Clash is very bizarre and weird which make exploring even more fun :D The main focus of the combat system are the melee fights.  It is pretty basic and not very complicated to master the melee system. You can punch, kick, throw, block, evade and deflect attacks. Combine those possibilities with the physics engine turns to be a LOT of fun!The weapons are very easy to use. Most of them have unlimited ammo but need to be reloaded properly. If you want to put your weapon away for a melee fight, you just need to ""lock on"" to an enemy.The levels are pretty small but it works for this title. The only thing I didn't like it so far would be the skybox. It was pretty empty most of the time. The story is quite nice and makes you want to buy the sequel... KAK!			"

												This game isn't anything BUT good!The game story is intresting! It tells the start at the end!Good game desighn, could be betterAnd a bunch of weird stuff to make you questions!Now, let me talk about how this game is MUCH better then the second.The story has a twist, a very good ending,and story. The second is just a bunch of golems, which it says nothing about in the first game, and in the second game 10% of it you know why you need to say Father-Mother, heck i barley even know why you need to save Father-Mother. In the first game the controls are easy to learn and fast to comprehend. But in the second game it isn't the same, and it's like ""Prezeh yeayeh 2 preeayas aeh burrton"" bassicly the controls are MUCH worst and harder to get used to. And it just doesn't have the same... Feel, i don't know why but i'd perfer the old models then the new,the story doesn't ever surrond much about what happened in the past of the original zeno clash (this) and it's just heartbreakining to get a good game, then have a sequl which is bad. If there's a zeno clash 3, atleast make it better!I hope you liked me review, i know it's not good, and yes i understand zeno clash 2 is good. But i don't think it's the same.			"

												This is a first person melee brawler, which is quite a new take on the genre. The world is imaginatively designed and the music, while not particularly special is a nice mix of tribal music.Its a short and linear adventure at around 6 hours. Gameplay is a hit and miss. When the punches connect, they feel satisfying. However, it is frustrating when hit detection goes wonky. There is also a lock-on mechanic, while useful in theory, is a hassle when you need to get away from enemies. While there are also guns, they have too little ammo and load much too slowly to be effective in combat. The story is simple, but the way its presented is confusing and the characters aren't very memorable. The female sidekick you have doesn't help much at all in combat and would have been much better if she can be used as a co-op partner.Overall Rating: 6.5 / 10Not worth to buy full price, but worth a look if on sale. This is an unpolished gem and is a good first effort from this indie studio.			"

												I got this game in a bundle awhile back and just recently got around to playing it.This is a first person fighting game with a unique art style. Another reviewer referred to it as ""Stonepunk"", and I feel that is an appropriate description.The first part of the game was interesting with the blend of first person fighting and gunplay, but by the end of the game I was more than ready to be done with it. The story and characters are mediocre at best, and the game is quite short. The combat, which starts out relatively fun, degenerates into a repetitive slugfest with you constantly getting overwhelmed by more enemies than you can keep track of (including snipers) and it simply ends up being not fun by the end.On top of that, the combat controls were glitchy and didn't always register, and there's some major issues with enemies being invincible during most animations and your character getting stuck in a corner and taking a ton of damage. The icing on the cake is the baffling control decision to have the block/dodge key also throw your weapon, which makes fights with certain types of enemies far more difficult/annoying than they should be since the only way to harm them is with a melee weapon, but they almost always block your attacks if you're in front of them. You basically have to sprint in a circle around them (and they still hit you half the time from angles you wouldn't expect, and do a ton of damage) when you should be able to dodge and counterattack (they can do it to you, why can't you return the favor?).Overall, when this game works, it's a satisfying first person brawler, but when it doesn't it is one of the most frustrating and annoying games I've played in awhile. While not a completely terrible game, it has enough issues and little enough content (you fight against the same dozen or so characters over and over again in the course of the game) that I can't really recommend it unless you got it for next to nothing in a bundle like I did.

												This is a very unique expierience that stands out from most games for various reasons that i will go into. i say that this game, atleast from me, gets a 9/10. why? let's find out.Visuals 10/10: this game's design is outlandish and surreal in almost every nook and cranny, but my oh my is it beautiful to look at. even though it does follow an invisible wall system, it feels as though you can just walk out and explore the world of zenoik. and that's just talking about it's scenery, it's characters are just as strange but fun to look at as their environment. from the corwids to the northern gate gang, there is a vibrant and bizarre variety of characters to see. and granted even though this game is considerably older than most next gen titles, it is very impressive for it's time.Gameplay 9/10: the concept of not relying on guns or swords but entirely on your fists sounds like anybody's childhood dream. and by god is it satisfying to punch somebody's face in in this game,and this right here is what makes this game so refreshing from the other titles. and it's great to feel that sense of impact when you hit someone or throw them into another fighter, through the majority of the game you'll have to rely on that. and even though there are weapons, they are all balanced to a degree in which you should only really use them if you absolutley have to. for example the club, it causes considerable damage to fighters but will break upon constant use. the cons about this though is the fact that i wish there were more combinations and ways to inflict damage than there already are. for example maybe adding in a right punch left punch system that would allow and demand for combo moves. but overall, it is a solid gameplay system.Story 7.5/10: this is where zeno clash starts to show some pretty bad flaws, it's story is fantastic and it's thought provoking. but it's really hard to follow sometimes and it cause alot of confusion with how fast things go by, especially the flashbacks, in which ghat explains why did what he did. but they seem to go by at the speed of sound sometimes expecting it's audience to keep up. however! it's voice acting and characterization is what saves it, you will remember who is who with their unique design and backgrounds and they will serve as reminders for later on if you happen to have forgotten what has happened. overall, it's an amazing storyline hindered by minor plotholes and really fast pacing.Concept 10/10: probably one of the most crisp and unique designs i've seen to date. for stonepunk is not a genre you hear all too often due to it not sounding all that appealing or fun. but it is indeed a sight to behold, and what i love most about it is it's independence in character design, you could add a rock man wearing bones around him and he'd fit in just fine. and it's design may turn others away for fearful reasons even, for some of the characters do look very bizarre and for some quite hideous or terrifying. but if your tired of seeing copy and paste soldiers or sexy chicks with no other purpose than being attractive. than this is a design worth looking into.Replayability 9/10: this is an absolute joy to play, whether your looking for overly fun gameplay or delicous eyecandy this is worth the price it has. for there are many possibilities for how you can go about fights in the second playthrough, for example you may have been beaten by jsaj over a million times due to you just starting the game but be able to be an equal or better fighter than he is on the second try due to knowing how to play better. as for the story, you can play it again and have a more clear understanding of things, but as for all story based games you will already know what will happen. so nothing will suprise you too much. Overall: this is a diamond in the rough for video game standards, with a concept so bold that it could've really sunk all the way down to rock bottom. but it succeeds in what it tries to accomplish, bare knuckle fightin'. it almost makes me wish that there were more first person punchers out there with how well this turned out. and even though it feels as though it sacrifices a good story for better gameplay, i don't think many will complain if they just want to have fun. but in all honesty, this is a must have in my opinion for those who want to see something new and done well on their plate.

												Good concept that was TERRIBLY executed. Voice, scenery, and ambiance is good. However, this is the most unresponsive game I have ever played.Get this on deep discount, and then play it only because it's a FPV puncher. Then uninstall 4 hours later (which is how long it took me to complete the entire game). Zeno Clash doesn't really merit more of a review than that.			"

												Its for me a fix of Hack & Slay and Beat em up with even range weapons. The story is nice has even some mysterious points and some points are unique like the end. The game is a non A+++ game so the lenght is fine for some hours. What i dont like is if you replay parts you cant skip the videos. The graphic has something strange art style and could have some more details but its fine because the low budget. I like this game because this atmohsphere and the short story pick up on a few levels/ chapters. The sound is in the middle sometimes its nearly good and it never get on my nervs. The challenge and high difficult settings are a nice test of your skills. I give this game personaly 8.3 points of 10.0			"

												Definitely not my thing.The setting intrigued me initially and I love the world it's set in, but as a game, it's essentially street fighter with bird people.That's not to say the game is bad, It's just not something I would play repeatedly.I long ago stopped playing combat-centric games.As this game goes, it has FANTASTIC combat.If you like focusing on which attack to choose on a particular opponent, you will like this game. A lot.You will like it doubly if you're into post-apocalytic dystopain sci-fi stories.I wish they'd expounded on the world they had created more, but I highly recommend this game, despite not being a huge fan of the genre.

												Zeno Clash is an interesting fighting game in a weird world full of odd creatures with questionable looks. Not to mention that they talk very badly. But still, you get to beat creatures up.The bosses of this game are interesting and the story isn't bad at all. The gameplay for ""common mobs"" might get a bit repetitive, but the change of scenery and all the ""story time"" places make up for it. If you're into fighting games (more like punching) then this game would deserve a peek.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												In Zeno Clash, you play as Ghat who is part of a 'family' by this strange creature known as Father-Mother. During the beginning of the game, things won't be very clear except that the supposed brothers and sisters that are a part of this family accuse you of killing Father-Mother. More is revealed as you progress in the game and you eventually find out the truth. Personally, I won't go into further details about the story to avoid spoilers.The gameplay is very unique in such a way that you don't often see this genre...This game plays in a first person perspective but your use of combat isn't through weapons (there is ranged weapons in the game, but you won't always be using them) instead, you use your fists to beat the ever living crap out of whoever stands in your way. You can lock on to your enemies and switch between which can be handy for quickly knowing when to defend or attack. At some areas of the game, your fists alone won't be reliable enough to hurt some enemies as some of them can vary from big enemies who charge at you and can knock you over resulting in some nasty damage or you have creatures that spit crap at you. So what do you do when it comes down to that? You use weapons! You can pick up some unique looking weapons that help from dual welded bone like pistols to a crossbow that fires skulls that explode upon impact with your enemies or you can have a bone sledgehammer that can deal massive damage to your enemies as you charge your swing.The level design is incredibly trippy but that's likely what the developers were going for as the world of Zeno Clash is incredibly unreal and is full of plenty of strange yet pretty scenary.Zeno Clash also has a unique tower mode which you unlock levels of as you progress through the main story. In the tower mode, you are inside a tower killing every enemy in the room to progress higher into the tower and you also also put against a time which shows how long you take. The timer isn't all too important as its just to put you against your friends to see who's faster at the level. As you progress, you'll meet all the different enemies you have met throughout the main game and in some rooms, you will have weapons that you can use or disarm from your enemies. But in the later levels there will also be room hazards that can be useful for killing your enemies in one fell swoop but be careful! As if you aren't, you can also be killed quickly.All in all, Zeno Clash is a incredibly fun game where you beat the crap out of people and I recommend checking it out if you're looking to punch in some faces! Plus, if you buy it and own Garry's Mod, you'll get all the models from the game!			"

												Zeno Clash is strange. There it is. I said it. You're totally surprised.Not only is it strange, but it's awkward. Honestly I couldn't tell if I was enjoying it until I completed it in one night. The concept is great. The melee combat is innovative and challenging. The story is so different that you'll spend most of the game being confused and wanting to know more. The story is one thing, but the scenery is astounding. It's like being shoved into someone's nightmare and battling disfigured humanoids and being afraid of the environment. I see 'Surreal' in the game tags now, which hits the nail on the head.Zeno clash is all over the place with the scenes that take place. I don't want to get into details - mostly since it's been a bit since I've played it and don't want to be 'that jackass', but the story is pretty much the entire game to me. I can't go around spouting out spoilers, right? ;b			"

												Zeno Clash is a very interesting First Person Brawler, in which you play as Ghat, one of the many children of the strange FatherMother, who, after killing FatherMother, is chased out of town by his own brothers and sisters. The game's story starts right after FatherMother's murder, but there's also flashback sequences when Ghat tells his friend Deadra about the events that lead to him killing FatherMother.Now, let's talk about the gameplay. As I mentioned above, it's a First Person Brawler, which means that for most of the game you'll be fighting with your fists. There's weapons, too, and areas in which you're required to use them, but for most of the game, it's a lot more satisfying to simply punch your way out. Progression is fairly linear, you'll go from point A to point B, fighting enemies in the middle, with some cutscenes here and there adding more story. Don't take that as a negative, though! It works fine enough for this game.The game also has a challenge mode, unlocked through story progression, with two distinct types: tower and pit. In the Tower challenge levels, you'll fight through five floors, each one filled with different enemies, and you must reach the top in the shortest amout of time possible, while losing very little health; even then, if you do lose some health in a floor, you'll gain some of it back for the next one. The Pit challenge levels have you going down a pit, trying to reach the bottom without killing yourself (if you drop from too high, you'll die), while some enemies try to fight you.I guess I should talk about the art style, which is quite unique; you'll find a world filled with bizarre environments and creatures; even some of the most ""normal"" characters, like Ghat or Deadra, have their bits of weirdness. And the soundtrack is excellent, I should say, with some really good tracks playing during the fight sequences. All of this adds to making Zeno Clash a really good game.Of course, not everything is positive; even though I enjoyed the game a lot, it seems to have some issues with hit detection: sometimes I would attack an enemy thinking that my fist would hit them, only to hit thin air, while in other cases, believing to be out of reach, some enemies have managed to hit me. Even then, this isn't noticeable for most of the game.So, to conclude, I can say I recommend Zeno Clash.			"

												One of my first purchases here on Steam. I believe it was back in 2009 if I remember correctly and it did have a very nice discount on it so it was immediately in my basket.Zeno Clash is an ambitious first person shooter game developed by ACE Team and released in 2009. The game uses the modified version of the Source Engine so it runs very well and while it is somewhat of an aged engine it still - in my opinion - looks good. Interestingly, rarely do you have the chance to use weapons with projectiles; emphasis is on melee combat and you do have the chance to use some clubs or other heavy weapons beside your fists. Combat is simple but very smooth - the game is very linear and as it is an independent game you can already guess it is quite short.Story-wise the game is rather silly - it puts you in the shoes of Ghat who is banished from his home after an attempt to kill Father-Mother. Yes, this creature is his father and mother as it seems the entire population of Ghat's settlement was raised by this hermaphroditic creature. Although banished, Ghat wishes to uncover the truth as to what really happened and what secret lies with the family.Anyways, combat is quite good and the game has a challenge option with levels of a tower to compete against a series of enemies. This is getting difficult gradually - a nice way to pass time once the story mode is finished.Zeno Clash is somewhat mediocre, but I believe the result of an original idea. If it is on sale this is a highly recommended game.			"

												This game has too many cool ideas and never fleshes them out enough to actually make an interesting story! Also, the plot twist is crap and so is the whole motivation behind the main character. The dialoag is all forced and the enitre game is just one bad mistake after another.What do it mean? Here's an example: This game allows you to shoot enemies with various weapons and then switch them out as you fight or stow them and your your fists. Sounds cool right? NOPE!!! The Lock Target button is mapped to the Swap Target button and the Pick Up New Weapon action. THE FREAKIN ""E"" key! So when your rushing up to a guy who just dropped his much better weapon, you instinctively press the E key to snap it up. ERRRRT Now youre locked onto the nearest enemy and youre now open for an attack CUZ YOUVE STILL GOT THE CRAPPY FISH PISTOLS.4/10 Save Your Money.			"

												A true hidden gem that deserves so much more recognition. I haven't seen such hauntingly alien landscapes and settings since Morrowind, the visual desing in this game is excellent with every location being memorable and every character becoming quickly recognizable at a glance. The combat is fresh, easy to learn but difficult to master and very satisfying which is amazing when you consider this is a first person fighting game! Even the plot feels like something vibrant and different, while fairly simple and some what predictable, you are presented with a rich and detailed world that oozes life and history but never feels the need to bog things down explaining itself. The closest thing I can think of to bring up as criticism is that the sound design is very lacking, the music is so forgettable that it may as well not be there and the voice actors seem strictly amateur. It's also very short, there is some replay value with multiple endings and a challenge mode but it's still only a few afternoons worth of play. These are however very minor flaws in an otherwise beautiful game.At the price this goes for during sales you owe it to yourself to experience this.			"

												I wanted to wait until I finished everything in Zeno Clash before I wrote a review on it.I like this game a lot. It has such a weired origonal setting full of interesting characters. The story can be a bit confusing but is overall its pretty good. In terms of gameplay the story is rather short but there are challenge levels afterwards that are fairly difficult and will take time and skill to complete.Gameplay wise the combat system is fairly simple and somewhat repeteive but very entertaining. The game consists of several martial arts battle with one to several opponents. The only real complaint I have with the game is that the controller support is terrible and I could not get it to work with my 360 controller well enough to use it. With that being sade the game plays just fine with a mouse and keyboard.Overall I would give it a 7.5/10 well executed with some noticable flaws. "

												This game felt like it came so close to being awesome, but fell short. When the game started, I was thrilled by the battle mechanics, they felt so smooth and full of impact on the enemy. However, my opinion of it did a nosedive once the actual game started. The enemies have far too much health, and fighting becomes a chore. Every fight is the same. Block - punch - wait for them to get up - repeat 10 times. The game would have been much improved by making the enemy's health bar 25% what they are now, and giving me more variety in enemies.			"

												One of the more genuinely strange games I've ever played--made all the more strange by the fact that it doesn't seem to be cribbing from any familiar sources (at least that I am aware of) to construct its game world. You play a guy who is cast out of his tribe after murdering your hermaphroditic Father/Mother under mysterious circumstances. As the game progresses you piece together the events leading up to the murder all while evading your siblings who are out for vengeance.Oh yeah, and it's also a first person beat em up. Despite being such a potentially disastrous genre hybrid (FPS fighting games have rarely worked) the fighting mechanics and controls are actually implemented fairly well. Likewise, the art direction is top notch. Ultimately the central game mechanics are a bit limited, but the game is smart enough to be brief, ending just before you start to get bored with things. I probably prefer ""Rock of Ages"" (by the same team), but this is a worthy first game from them.			"

												There aren't many first person fighting games around so this game feels rather unique, not only due to the gameplay but also its quite peculiar art style. While I feel the guns weren't really a necessary addition to the game they can be ignored for the most part if you'd prefer to just punch your way though the game. The story mode isn't all that long at around 3-4 hours but there is also a challenge mode that will give you quite a few more hours of play time.This game's style and unique gameplay make it particularly memorable, definitely worth the price especially at the low price that it is often discounted for.

												First person action/melee brawler in which you are one of the many children of Father-Mother and the only to know his dark secret. You must fight your brothers and sisters on your journey to confront Father-Mother. The story unfolds through cutscenes and flashbacks and is really eccentric. The areas and transitions feel quite disconnected initially, but near the end it starts coming together, things get interesting and the ending is satisfying.The combat isn't simple or intuitive and it'll take you a long time to learn advanced moves like dodging and countering attacks. Even the easiest difficulty will be frustrating if you don't master this system, so there is some skill involved. The game looks great with nice art, but the soundtrack is mediocre. It's short, lasting only a few hours if you don't try for achievements or challenge modes. There isn't a lot of depth here: no stats or inventory, it's 100% linear/combat and not much enemy or weapon variation, but still a good game.			"

												Zeno clash a first person shooter game set in a crazy some what cave man style world full of mystery and oddity. Sit back and gaze a pone this beautiful word while trying to not die by suicidal squirrels with bombs strapped to them.Game Play: 8The game play over all is a typical shooter for the most part. You get guns that you aim and shoot while running around. However this game adds in a nice elemental of first person melee combat. While this game is mostly about shooting than melee, The melee does add a nice touch to it but it also has it's own problems. While trying to melee it tends to feel off and a little clunky. However if you can get the melee down it's pretty fun. Some of the weapons you have are duel Pistols, a rifle, a crossbow, skull grenades, and more. Each has an alt fire that can be used. Pretty much like most other shooters it's mainly point and shoot not much else.There isn't many bosses to fight in game. However this game has one of my most favorite boss fights of all time. You'll find yourself fighting a blind bounty hunter who sits on top of a dinosaur's head that is at least fifty feet above you. Who gives you a rift to make it far for you to fight him. He sits up there shooting down at you. While tossing down squirrels with bombs strapped to them to chase you around and blow up that you have to kick around and avoid. Yes... you did read that right... mother ♥♥♥♥ing squirrels with mother ♥♥♥♥ing bombs strapped to there mother ♥♥♥♥ing backs! How can you NOT like this boss fight! It is so odd but yet so much fun!Story: 7The story takes place in a fictional fantasy world called Zenozoik, and begins in a town called Halstedom. You play as ghat the protagonist of the game, You are running away from your home village after being hunted by everyone from there. You found out father-mother biggest darkest secret and now in fear of your life. With your girlfriend Deadra you both leave the village to trivial to the end of the world to find answers. The story has a great build up. It makes you want to know whats going to happen, why you are being hunted, and what is this BIG secret that ghat know. However when it's finally revealed what it is, you kinda feel disappointed. You have this great build up of a story to be let down at the end.Graphics: 9The graphics really sets the mood. Each level you go to has it's over style and feel to it. The last level you where just in doesn't look like the one your current in. Each level feels different and fresh while keeping to the primal cave man feel of the game. The graphics are all over the place from bright looking to dark. Some how it all works out nicely. You get a real sense of this world.To be honest, the world to me feels like Alice in wonderland but cave man style. You have such a massive world with crazy looking characters from humans, to animals, to each scene. The graphics really sets this game up nicely. I can not express how much I love the graphics for this game and just how it all comes together to make this world. It's a pretty unique experience. To me this what really makes game shine the most.Music: 8The music does a good job keeping pace with whats going on. It helps to make the world to come alive with the background ambiance. The music does a great job to set each level up and keep it feeling unique as much as possible.Final Though:Even though the game play is like a lot of other shooters with some added melee. This game just shines when it comes to presentation of the world. You will find your self lost in this crazy mystical world. Wanting to see more of what this world has to offer. I was so immersed in the world alone just because how it looked and felt and with all the crazy characters you end up meeting just really pulls it together to make it feel so unique. I compare this world of alice in wonder land, though not as amazing as alice but it has the great mystical feel to it that keep you wanting more.However like I said before it kinda of falls off the story with a great build up with a disappointing ending. However the ending is better than some other games out there. I find this game a good game to play for any one who like first person shooters. However this game IS weird and odd. If you can't get behind outlandish things you may find your self not liking this game.I sat down and beat this game in one sitting. Took me roughly 6 hours to beat it. So over all I would recommend this most to most people.Also...mother ♥♥♥♥ing Squirrels with mother ♥♥♥♥ing bombs strapped to there mother ♥♥♥♥ing backs!Final Score: 8for more reviews and other fun things check out my tumblr. www.rogue32807.tumblr.com "

												This game is short, easy, and overall unsatisfying. I died maybe three times, and it still took me under three hours. I appreciate having melee centered first person combat, but they could have done it so much better. The fighting gets stale quick.			"

												Zeno Clash is a fun 3D brawler with a unique setting. It features a fun story with changing playstyles that still mainly rely on melee combat. There's some shooter sections, some classic use that one quest item section, and other neat sections but in the end you're pummeling whatever ""weird"" thing charges at you.			"

												First person action/melee brawler in which you are one of the many children of Father-Mother and the only to know his dark secret. You must fight your brothers and sisters on your journey to confront Father-Mother. The story unfolds through cutscenes and flashbacks and is really eccentric. The areas and transitions feel quite disconnected initially, but near the end it starts coming together, things get interesting and the ending is satisfying.The combat isn't simple or intuitive and it'll take you a long time to learn advanced moves like dodging and countering attacks. Even the easiest difficulty will be frustrating if you don't master this system, so there is some skill involved. The game looks great with nice art, but the soundtrack is mediocre. It's short, lasting only a few hours if you don't try for achievements or challenge modes. There isn't a lot of depth here: no stats or inventory, it's 100% linear/combat and not much enemy or weapon variation, but still a good game.			"

												A true hidden gem that deserves so much more recognition. I haven't seen such hauntingly alien landscapes and settings since Morrowind, the visual desing in this game is excellent with every location being memorable and every character becoming quickly recognizable at a glance. The combat is fresh, easy to learn but difficult to master and very satisfying which is amazing when you consider this is a first person fighting game! Even the plot feels like something vibrant and different, while fairly simple and some what predictable, you are presented with a rich and detailed world that oozes life and history but never feels the need to bog things down explaining itself. The closest thing I can think of to bring up as criticism is that the sound design is very lacking, the music is so forgettable that it may as well not be there and the voice actors seem strictly amateur. It's also very short, there is some replay value with multiple endings and a challenge mode but it's still only a few afternoons worth of play. These are however very minor flaws in an otherwise beautiful game.At the price this goes for during sales you owe it to yourself to experience this.			"

												There aren't many first person fighting games around so this game feels rather unique, not only due to the gameplay but also its quite peculiar art style. While I feel the guns weren't really a necessary addition to the game they can be ignored for the most part if you'd prefer to just punch your way though the game. The story mode isn't all that long at around 3-4 hours but there is also a challenge mode that will give you quite a few more hours of play time.This game's style and unique gameplay make it particularly memorable, definitely worth the price especially at the low price that it is often discounted for.

Pros:-Combat is very unique and fun-Art style- An additional ""tower climb"" challange mode if you want.Cons:-Very linear-There is a ""lock on"" mechanic in the game that happens when you fight an enemy. This can be disengaged manually, but can get a bit annoying when it comes to fighting 3+ people are once.- There was one instance where i had to reload the level because it got bugged. Nothing major and it only took me about 5 minutes to make it up.Neutral:-It is short - like 3-4 hours. "

												I wanted to wait until I finished everything in Zeno Clash before I wrote a review on it.I like this game a lot. It has such a weired origonal setting full of interesting characters. The story can be a bit confusing but is overall its pretty good. In terms of gameplay the story is rather short but there are challenge levels afterwards that are fairly difficult and will take time and skill to complete.Gameplay wise the combat system is fairly simple and somewhat repeteive but very entertaining. The game consists of several martial arts battle with one to several opponents. The only real complaint I have with the game is that the controller support is terrible and I could not get it to work with my 360 controller well enough to use it. With that being sade the game plays just fine with a mouse and keyboard.Overall I would give it a 7.5/10 well executed with some noticable flaws. "

												I picked up Zeno Clash after having already played the second game with a friend, and I can tell you, the second one is better. This entry is pretty fun, but it lacks the quality of storytelling, free-roaming mechanics and of course, 2-player coop. However, it is significantly more straightforward (and thus, shorter), and the guns can be reloaded, though they have a habit of being knocked out of your hands. They do less damage then in the second game, and the hammers are much more awkward to use. Generally it's much easier to just punch things- except for the obnoxious heavy fights, which require you to use the hammers.Still, without having played this one (or had someone explain the premise), the second game really would not make a lot of sense, given the weirdness of not only the setting and asthetic but the morality and motivations of its characters. Collectively, the series is certainly the most unique thing to come out of the Source Engine, and worth playing. I would advise you play this entry before the second game, however.			"

												Obviously ZC served the maximum enjoyment i experienced in FPS shooters so far. It is a mixture of melee and gun fight, no question that the best part of the game is the unique hand to hand combat system, which is the most determinant part of the game. However, environmental components makes the game world a bit cartoonish,   and quite grotesque which may be turns the game hardly consumable for some people who do not like this kind of artistic style.Summa summarum, this is a crazy and strange world with aching heads, and toothless blood spitting people.Also stay tuned because ZC2 coming in 2013!

												Quick Summary: Zeno Clash is built on the Half Life 2 Source engine, so that should give you an idea what to expect in terms of graphics and hardware requirements. However in gameplay and art style the games are completely different. I gave Zeno Clash a try because my video card crapped out a while back and I wanted to try something less hardware intensive while I waited for a replacement. It was a fun game, but it’s definitely not for everyone.First off, note that the world of Zeno Clash is weird and alien while seeming like it could possibly be a post-apocalyptic Earth (it’s not). The “people” speak English but mix in strange words and phrases like it was an adaptation of a novel. Many citizens of this world are also a mix, of human and animal. Some of the people you’ll encounter are fully human while others look like bird men, elephant men, or just completely original beasts. The environment is sort of stone age with some odd guns/crossbows/magic thrown in (fish guns?). You play a human looking dude named Ghat who for some reason is being chased down by his former brothers and sisters. You and your one friend in the world are on a quest to bring justice to the children of Father/Mother (the main antagonist) even as these children fight you every step of the way.While I mentioned guns earlier, the game is mostly melee fighting, and you’ll need to get comfortable dodging and blocking blows from enemies, sometimes simultaneously from different sides.  The guns are mostly weak pea shooters but can be helpful if you get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off from trading punches with a bunch of cheaters. Unlike kung-fu movies, these guys like to all attack at the same time. There is some variety in enemy types, but they’re mostly the same fighting style with character appearances. It’s the really big dudes that you need to watch out for.Pros:+Weird story that keeps you thinking. You’ll probably spend a bunch of the time trying to figure out what’s going on, and what happened leading to Ghat’s predicament.+The melee fighting system is fun, though challenging since you’re playing in First Person Shooter perspective and can only really concentrate on one guy at a time.Cons:-The graphics are rather dated, since the game is pretty old-There’s no “easy mode” for people who just want to experience the story. The game’s difficulty can be brutal for new players at certain point. The challenge levels seem more frustrating than they’re worth, especially when you’re forced to fight a whole group at once, and your “target lock” messes with your repositioning efforts.Overall, if you’ve run out of games to play or just want to try something weird, you can do a lot worse than Zeno Clash.

												A loose connection of small corridors that are unreasonably padded with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Oh yes, it's not only a first-person punch-'em-up, it also throws in wildlife for you to shoot with guns that deal small amounts of damage while taking their time to reload. If you thought you could punch the buggers with your mighty fists, think again: they spawn behind the walls of the level, so shoot away, chum.First-person fighting is rare in video games, and it's rare for a reason. If you're fighting more than one enemy at a time, which is always, you are bound to get blindsided and be interrupted mid-combo. You could keep your distance, keep everyone in your sights, use satisfyingly powerful melee weapons and win the encounter unscratched. Or you could not play this game and ultimately have a better time.			"

Zeno Clash boasts a difficulty ramp that is unleveled and radical, in addition to a storyline that is mediocre on a good day. The gameplay, while could be improved, is admittedly quite nice, and has a nice ebb and flow to it. However, this does not mak up for it's other lacking mechanics. In addition to all of this, for the amount it costs, it is a frustratingly short game, and lengthing it would also improve the value immensely.			"

												Zeno Clash is a very interesting title. It takes place in a world that you aren't told much about, and it's a world filled with various types of humanoids, some human and some half animal. You play as Ghat, a man on the run alongside a friend and accused of murdering a creature called ""Father-Mother"". It sounds like an interesting story, and while the story itself and what actually takes place is good, the writing and the voice acting are not all that great and it detracts from what would otherwise be a decent tale. However, the graphics and gameplay both make up for these issue. The game is beautiful looking with a unique looking world with beautiful skies and landscapes, and you'll never see the same thing twice so you're never bored with what you see. This is good, as the game is played entirely from a first person perspective.The game is best described as a beat em up, as you progress, face hordes of enemies, and progress to the next segment. You don't learn new moves or upgrades as you go, but that is fine as you do well with what the game gives you. It's solid with blocks, dodges, punches, kicks, and throws along with hand to hand weaponry and guns. It's hard to be bored as you progress the game's campaign. There are four levels of difficulty, with my playthrough happening on Hard but there is also Easy, Normal, and Extreme. Hard mode presented a great challenge and it took about eight hours to get through it. Once you're done, there is a set of challenges to go through with a fixed difficulty to try your hand at.It's a beautiful, brutal, knock you down your♥♥♥♥♥recommendation. Give it a shot.			"

												TL;DR – The most this caveman brawler gives you in terms of plot and setting exposition is a moderately-short blurb on the game’s store page. Also, one of the enemy models closely resembles a *ToTaLLy MEtAl* version of the Swedish Chef from “The Muppet Show”. Recommend. Onto the review:It’s actually to Zeno Clash’s benefit that it doesn’t really explain itself outside of the basic gameplay mechanics, which are simplistic but nevertheless require a bit of finesse if you’re playing on any of the higher difficulties. To elaborate, combat is your typical mouse-bound primary-light-attack, secondary-heavy-attack affair, utilizing the spacebar for blocking and evading. Uncoordinated lout that I am, this was interpreted as “spam the secondary/primary and run around like a chicken sans head”. This ""style"" of gameplay actually worked for me, thanks to the normal-level difficulty setting I was playing on, in addition to smartly-placed health items in each area. Unfortunately, this is also the likely cause of the game’s growing tediousness later on, as, outside of a few close calls and even some deaths, I was just smashing through opponents in area after area. To offset this, there is some variety in the stages; for example, a brawling sequence being followed by a shooting gallery level, or some other contrivance (like using a magic torch to light up pyres and moving statues alike). And the guns, oh the guns. Indeed, the weapons in Zeno Clash most succinctly sum up the game’s overall art aesthetic; the closest comparison in décor is that of “The Flintstones”, with its brightly-colored yet naturalistic designs. Hell, there’s even dinosaurs (or at least large reptiles resembling them) in a level or two. The guns themselves specifically piqued my interest, as the idea of a primeval-era slugthrower is just surreally fantastic. For example, the pistols, which basically appear to be carved shells with a bunch of nails and rocks stuffed into them, are just fun to look at and use in all of their pea-shootery goodness (which may also explain why I keep running into the same named characters again after I so thoroughly obliterate their asses). Besides the art design, this sense of backwards absurdity is ingrained in the plot and characters; outside of the aftermentioned blurb, the game leaves it up to the progression of the narrative itself to explain what the hell is going on, eking out small bits of info through dialogue and actions. It's a refreshing break from grandiose blocks of text that describe a game's lore in exacting detail, but I fear the world of Zeno Clash might still be too alien to experience without detailed explanation for some players. At the same time however, it's that same feeling of unknowingness that may spur other players (myself included) to push on and immerse themselves in the absolute weirdness that is this game.  Final words: Zeno Clash is so aesthetically ""out there"" that it may dissuade players from digging into it, but the fairly-conventional combat system, in addition to a relatable (if somewhat vague) storyline, signifies that this 5ish-hour-long brawler is still worth playing for a couple of bucks.

 My Experience Playing this game on my own was impossible to do in one sitting. I desperately gasped after something real to look at after 20, or so minutes, because it felt suffocating. In order to complete the game I had to hold my breath as I progressed. After I ran out of air, I'd have to escape and take a real breather. This isn't real. This isn't real. This isn't real. Graphics The graphics look really good and it utilizes the Source Enging to it's fullest potential to deliver something unseen before. It does this at the same time as it provides solid performance. Gameplay You get to approach this game with both melee and different weapons. Each one feels distinctly unique and fun to use. The guns are not restricted to only shooting, since they can be thrown, providing a useful stun if you've run out of ammo. Ammunition is pretty rare to come by, so you'll see yourself using anything to win a fight.The melee combat is where this game shines, though. It's one of the first that defined a proper melee combat system in first person. It's complex, fun and rewarding as you learn to use it. You dodge, block, kick and punch your way through enemies. Story This game would be nothing without it's story. It's a part of what makes it so hallucinating. If you feel like it's normal, then you're not. Summarization An absolutely great game which I definitely can't reccomend enough. The price is ludicrous at 9,99€ for this masterpiece. At sales it goes down by 90% to 0,99€. You have literally nothing to lose but your sanity, if you isolate yourself with this game. Don't isolate yourself with this game. Remeber that This isn't real. This isn't real. This isn't real., or society will probably have to euthanize you for your own good.  Score Survives the test of time  7.8 "

												I don't want to write a terribly long review of this game, because frankly I don't think it's deserving of one.  I started off rather curious and open-minded and felt that I was initially rewarded by a quirky but fun game.  The storyline had me intrigued, and as I continued to suspend disbelief and ignore a handful of ""game logic"" moments and repetitive fighting, I had hope that things would get better soon.  I was terribly mistaken.  After about 4 hours of gameplay, it feels like the dev team ran out of ideas and money.  Characters you've already fought are thrown back at you time and time again, and the story completely falls apart.  The ending is without a doubt the worst ending I've ever encountered in a video game.  The game rewards you for believing in it's surreal world by kicking you straight in the nuts as you realize all of your confusion was entirely justified.Unless you love the beat em up style and are prepared to fight the same characters using the same moves over and over and over again, AND can ignore massive plot holes, bad voice acting, and an unbelievably stupid story do NOT buy this game.  Not even on sale.  I chose to play this game on stream, and it was just frustrating, stupid, and the ending was unbelievably unsatisfying for everyone who watched.♥♥♥♥ing Rubik's Cube "

												Nothing is sense and everything is ♥♥♥♥. Great environments, good enough graphics, good combat system with responsiveness and a no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t feel. Normal or ""Hard"" mode is not very hard at all. Brawlers IMO are hard to balance but these devs did an ok job of it. Difficulty is badly done with + or - enemy damage. The AI is ok but nothing special. I found myself playing through looking forward to the next piece of scenery or story. The story is not good, but it is gripping as you just want to make sense of it all. I usually don't care much for the gameplay style of brawlers but I cannot say I disliked Zeno Clash at any point. The combat had adequate depth but my number one reason for playing through the game was for that fantastic art direction. It statisfied me.If the price is low, you want an acid trip gangbang, and like brawlers you could pick this up without regret.			"

The story is one of the things that ruins the game and something about some characters aren't explained very well (In the 2ND it is explained), but the fighting mechanics keeps you playing the game. After you complete the story, you can do these tower challenges with differents floors, enemies and weapons. Story is long 8 hours. If you like Zeno Clash 1, go get the 2nd too (It has Story Co-oP with 2 players!)			"

												The game has the most beautiful visuals for it's time and interesting places to see it has EXTREMELY linear gameplay and a pretty short game you can finish this game in around 3 to 4 hours , depending on difficulty and your own skills. It is worth a try if you like first person melee combat.Pros:Extremely StrangeSurreal SettingUnique GameChallenging FightsCons:Simple beat-em-up mechanicsINSANE cliffhangerScore: 8.5/10			"

												This is a fantastic  third person  beat em up  game with really  alien enviroscapes.  Beautifully  rendered, with   some  interesting weapons   that can be used if  your fighting skills aren't up to much.  Well worth  buying at full price (£6.99) , but if your skint, you must get it  when it's on sale where it usually sells for 75% to 80% off..			"

												Oh, beautiful Zeno Clash..Zeno Clash is probably the only First Person Brawler in existance, and it does it oh so well. Instead of holding a gun, you have fists, and those fists hammer into enemies' faces ruthlessly. There are grabs, palm strikes, kicks, parries.. finishing moves.. Oh, and also guns, though you rarely get the chance to use them. The game has quite a high learning curve, but as soon as you get it down, I've found that it is one of the more enjoyable combat systems I have had the pleasure of playing with.The world of Zeno Clash is also vibrant and full of unique characters. The one who struck me the most were the Corwid of the Free, who are all obviously clinically insane in their single-mindedness. They do things because they do them. Examples being that one only wanted to walk in a straight line, another only wanted to eat people because that's what he did, and another wanted to be invisible, so he removed the eyes over everything that could see him, including his own. The art department really outdid itself on character design, and there isn't a single character in the game that could be classified as 'bland'The game also features an arena mode, which is probably best played after a first playthrough to get the basics down. All in all, this game was worth every cent. Get it if you want something new (and disturbing)!			"

												This game is amazing!  I got it a while back in a Humble Bundle, and I saw it and it wasn't the game i was really looking forward to playing in that particular bundle.  But, I finally got around to playing it, and I have to say it's something else.  While I have played games that attempted the first-person brawler before, that really isn't what really sets it apart.  What really makes this game original is it's setting, story, and character design.  It's surprisingly refreshing and different than anything i've seen, not only in a game, but in any medium.			"

												Here's a game you should definitely try! It's both great and well... incredibly average, but it's satisfying from start to finish.This is a short game, you can easily complete it in about 3 hours. It's a kinda sloppy melee first-person brawler.  Its combat system isn't bad, but it gets clunky at times, specially in group fights. However, punching enemies into a 5 meter flight makes you feel like a badass. And the ragdoll physics on the corpses are a nice touch as well. I haven't played Zeno Clash 2 yet, but I will soon enough, and I assume the combat system has been polished since 2009, although I've heard it focus too much on team fights, which is where the clumsiness comes in... But I digress. The game shines in its world and characters, which are all really weird, but at the same time, charming. They present neat ideas that feel like they should have been much more explored and fleshed out, but everything seems experimental here, hence its length.For example: ""The Corwids are not slaves of reality, so they can be insane. Oxameter walks in a straight line without letting letting anything change his path... and that's what Oxameter does."" There are other Corwids with interesting... ""features"", so I'd definitely recommend picking this up if you're interested in them alone.Now, another problem I have, in regards to the exploration of the world, is that, since the game goes from one arena to the others, you barely have any time to explore the areas and take the time to appreciate the world they've created. While you're in combat, you'll be busy to look around, and the scenes end as soon and you beat everyone up. This still leaves you with an idea of what it is, but too vague for my liking. Again, I hope Zeno Clash II solves this ""issue"".Voice acting is pretty bad, but it's bearable, and didn't ruin the overall experience for me. The cutscenes follow the same route, with some cheesy animations, but again, that wasn't my reason to be playing the game, so it didn't really make much of a difference.So, for the conclusion. If you're interesting in world, creature and character design, this is definitely a must-buy. They've done a great job there, I thoroughly enjoyed it!  If you're coming for the combat system, or a grand scale story... well, you'll not find it here, not quite. Still, I'd encourage you to pick it up on a sale, since it's a very interesting game to play.Well, I'm off to play Zeno Clash II now, I'm definitely interested in what comes next. Cheers!			"

But if you are looking for a game described as so, Zeno Clash is the game to play.So instead of spending too much time trying to meditate and enter your own dream world, you can play Zeno Clash.Also most people would say the second game is better, but I think this one is just great. You'll probably want to play this one first to understand the story.			"

												PROS:  Artwork of the level designs is SURREAL and otherworldly (no wonder it was nominated for an award); good ability to fight with hands and feet as well as use of crossbow slingshots, ""pea shooters"" and melee; voice acting is generally good;  music generally good (although I turned it WAY down for most of the game).CONS:  Poorly-written story makes no sense; tries to be some kind of Aesop's Fable, only without the fable (i.e. no moral being taught);  somewhat repetitive fighting, as the same enemies you just KO'ed over a half a dozen times or more already keep showing up again and again throughout the game (gets tiresome).This Source-Engine-driven game's fantastic environment makes up for its weak, nonsensical story.  It had the potential to be something a LOT greater than it turned out to be.  Without disclosing any major spoilers, let me just say that once you get to the ending, you'll realize that the whole game takes place in some sort of endless time-loop, with Ghat (the protagonist) being the victim of a false accusation...  You'll also come to realize that the creature called Father-Mother is being ""outed"" (which is the game's sole redeeming aspect)... And if all that brawling was still not enough for you, there are post-game Tower levels (multi-level arenas) where you can duke it out to your heart's content.  Personally, after two playthroughs, I had had enough already...  Overall, it's a ""refreshingly-unique"" kind of game, and a recommended play.  Check it out. ---Additional note:  For all you other ""discerning"" gents out there who prefer to see beautiful women in games dressed a little more ""interestingly"", there is a mod available for Daedra that accomplishes just that quite nicely.  Without giving the links, do a search for ""Zeno Clash - Deadra Mod"" (found  on Fileplanet dot com), then run it with the free Texmod app (dmcmods dot com).  Works well.

												My experience with Zeno Clash was really strange. When I started, almost from very beggining I was put in fight, after two or three fights I closed game. I was wondering, when I will play it again. Combat system in Zeno Clash isn't bad - it's fine but also very annoying. I can't count how many times I got attacked from behind, but that's not what was annoying, the thing that comes after - not sure if it's bug, or if it should work that way, but almost everytime my character was performing once again last action. If fighting, in this kind of game, doesn't bring much pleasure then what is point of playing? This is easy question - THE WORLD AND CHARACTERS LIVING IN IT. This is most interesting part of game. I love every place and character this game have. With every next hour I wanted to know more. I would really love to see Zeno Clash as adventure game. I know I would have much more fun exploring new places, talking around and such than fighting. Well, that's just my opinion. If you love exploring bizzare worlds - Zeno Clash is good for that. Still, there is plenty of fighting, which can be hit or miss in case of Zeno Clash. In my case, it was sadly a miss.			"

												It's a weird game, that's for sure. But the combat (in first person) feels SOOOO good. I like how the punches feel, there's a certain weight to them. Add to that the fabulous (but weird) graphics and you have one heck of a game. Unfortunately, it's short (about 4 hours). But that's about the only negative thing I can say about it. It's so unique that I suggest you get this while you have the chance. Can't wait for the sequel (will it ever come ?).[Rating: 89/100]			"

Product received for free
												Well, I did play the entire game all the way though once on the middle diffuculty (describe as hard, mobs do normal damage).  Only took me 3 hours to beat.  I like that that it was short.  I have grown up enough that I don't have time to play games so being able to sit down and play one all the way through in one saturday is nice.  The story was, well it kept me hooked, but I wouldnt say it was good.  The world you are thrown in is pretty intriguing and interesting.  While the graphics are subpar (like most indy games) I was still able to be fully immensed in this place that resembled to me like a nuclear fallout (although it was never described as such).  The creativity that went into the world was the main thing that held my attention for the entire game.That being said, the gameplay was nothing to ride home about.  It had one of the better takes on hand to hand combat than any game I have played, but to be fair I have never played a game with hand to hand combat that I enjoyed.  I found myself always grabing a gun every chance I could and the guns were... well... how to describe it.  Appearently in this world guns are hard to find, so they are instead made out of very random things and very creatively done at that.  I found them to feel somewhat lacking though.  The game was entirely focused on hand to hand combat except one instance where you had to basically ""target practice"" as the acheivement suggest (definitely my favorite part of the game), while another instance was focused on flinging fire from your torch.  All in all, the story was pretty lame and gameplay nothing to brag home about, so I would probably not tell my friends to go out and buy it.  It was a nice free addition that came bundled with something i wanted.			"

The story is one of the things that ruins the game and something about some characters aren't explained very well (In the 2ND it is explained), but the fighting mechanics keeps you playing the game. After you complete the story, you can do these tower challenges with differents floors, enemies and weapons. Story is long 8 hours.

												They sell you the game as a first person brawler. You will end up shooting more than punching things.Awful voice acting, horrible story, terrible controls, copypaste enemies (including final boss). The only positive thing, is that the world is unique and bizarre, but if I wanted to know about those kinds of worlds I'd just stick to my books.The game is not worth even 0.69€ I spent on it, I'm asking for a refund. It's that bad.			"

												A very average action-arcade game where you fight with fists. The gameplay is quite unique, albeit get repetitive rather quickly. The story is terrible, so are characters, but who cares anyway. I think some action games fans might enjoy Zeno Clash, but for most it will be an average game like it is for me, hence I do not really recommend it.			"

												This was really mediocre. The shooting sections of the game are pain-staking, and the only ""joy"" I got out of this game was the beat em' up sections (mostly because you can toss them around like rag dolls). Besides the interface of the game looking like Garry's Mod, the graphics look like somthing from 2008, (the rendering has some issues and bugs too). The overall plot is boring, with a few messages in the game that aren't that original, and again, you really only care for smashing faces. 3-4/10			"

												This is easily the worst game I've ever played...ever.The whole entire game feels like it was created by a team of people who have never played a game before, or at least a good one. The lock on system is atrocious. You're stuck fighting one guy while three other enemies are all taking swings at you that you can't see coming, nor block. You're fighting the combat/lock on system more then you're fighting enemies. Also you get a power attack (right click) but don't even bother with it since the enemies ALWAYS dodge it so it's useless.The boss' in this game are laughable. I beat most of them by punching then running. Stick and move, there's no variation. The story is just trying to hard to be different, or abstract but it's neither. It's like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Oddworld without any substance. The graphics look like they were thrown together hastily. It's just a complete package of dumb. The worst game ever, and the sad part is it has a sequel. Anachronox has no sequel, Beyond Good and Evil has no sequel but THIS game has a sequel.			"

												Sort of hate it.It's a cool concept, but in a game with an incredibly crappy story, it really needs solid mechanics to be pulled off.It's buggy and annoying, the combat is repetitive, and frankly it's too difficult.It's also childish that the game starts on ""hard"" where the enemies do normal damage, but allows you to turn it down to ""normal"" so they do less. Note that turning down the difficulty doesn't really help. The enemies are still pretty annoying.It would be fine if the enemies were smarter and fought you in a 1v1, but it's either 3 annoying enemies with guns shooting you (seriously, the guns can be fun when you have them, but when an enemy has them it's absolute bull. A full clip of the dual pistols in the hands of an enemy will take about a third of your health. They practically never miss.) Any time you DO fight 1v1 it's versus a heavy enemy who you can ONLY fight with a buggy ""heavy weapon"" with a ridiculous hitbox and huge input lag, to which if you are ever infront of the enemy it will always block it and counterattack.That said, even in the 1v1s the game will randomly decide to throw some random trash mob at you midway through the fight just because trying to deal with their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics isn't enough, you now have to use an incredibly slow weapon to kill an immediately respawning fast-attack enemy, in order to get a few attacks on the enemy who likes to sit there and do nothing but block your attacks in order to progress through the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story.Maybe Zeno Clash 2 would be better JUST because of the multiplayer (I believe it's coop) so that you can have a fair fight for once.Sorry for the rant, this game♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, how was this released in 2009.

												This is a game about melee combat where the combat itself is clumsy and simplistic.  The game uses jarring FOV changes at strange spots and the lock-on system just makes it harder to play.  Levels are cramped and linear and the game mostly just consists of beating up groups of enemies.It's basically a game held up entirely by it's ridiculous strangeness, which isn't nearly enough to make it worth playing.

												I could not get this game running correctly. I normally don't mind spending 15 minutes getting a game probably set up as long as it works great for the next few hours that I'm playing it. However, I could never get the gameplay to stop stuttering no matter what was suggested on the forums by users and by developer. It's really unfortunate but I would recommend not bothering with this game as it seems to not work correctly on pc for quite a few people. Pretty disappointing as I was looking forward to the crazy world of Zeno Clash.			"

												This game was in my library for a very long time so I decided to give it a try. Now this game was by far the most strangest, out-there game, I have ever laid eyes on. The creatures are disturbing and crazy. The story was a bit confusing and bland, so its safe to say they really banked on the mind-numbing ""acid-trippy"" backdrop to sell the game. Visually the game wasn't bad per say, but it was developed on the Source engine, so obviously, it had a good platform to start from. I would like to say I was on the fence for this game, but I really wasn't. While playing I felt a longing for the end of the game. Once it was over, it left a empty...""What the f*** did I just play"" feeling. I can't say I'd recommend this game to anyone, but I have to give it some points to originality.			"

												There's a good game buried somewhere in here. The mechanics are great and the combat seems like what Dead Island was trying to achieve. Sadly the art director from this project was given nothing but a box of crayons and apparently M. Knight Shyamalan was hired to write what this game laughably calls a story. This is the single most unpleasant game to look at I've ever played. The scaling is awful and every character has hit the lowest point of the uncanny valley. Nearly everything is this game is unsettling to look at which would be great for a horror game but definitely not here. Zeno Clash proudly wears its pretentious art house mask, but unlike Braid, doesn't have the engaging story or gorgeous visuals to back it up.			"

												Zeno Clash is a first person ""brawler"" set in the most bizarre universe I have ever experienced.  The setting is a tribal culture, and the story revolves around the main character being accused of murder.  Weapons are sparse and primitive; the highlights are definitely on the ""brawling"", fighting hand to hand.  The moves and timing can be hard to learn at first, but beyond the learning curve engagements are very satisfying.  Levels are linear and boss fights are varied in execution.  The visuals and characters though MUST be experienced.  Its a short romp although there are some challenges to complete.  Worth a try for sure.			"

												No. Just, no. Absolutely nothing in this game makes any damn sense. The most mind-boggling thing so far is how this has a rating of 85%.The visuals are interesting, and the music reminds me of Diablo at times, but then that's about it. The voice acting is atrocious, the gameplay is severely lacking and repetative, and I'm not even sure if there's an actual story, despite their efforts.There's only so much an indie or 'non A+++' game can get away with before you have to stop treating it like a child's kindergarten project, giving it A's for effort. The one time I thought the game was going to do something interesting, or reveal what the actual plot was about, and it just immediately shoehorns you into a boss fight - the same exact one that you've already done half way through the game. That's all that ever happens; cutscene, pointless fight. Cutscene, pointless fight. Do you get to do anything to advance the plot? Explore? Manage an inventory (re: choose what weapon to carry around with)? No. Every 'level' or whatever you want to call it will choose how you will start the fight, that means it will either take away anything you were carrying at the time, or give you a random weapon and make absolutely zero effort on explaining why this happens.The majority of the game, you have a companion... but does she do anything to be even remotely helpful? No. During one of the boss fights that has no rhyme or reason (like much of the game), this character perches herself up on a vantage point with a rifle, and what does she do? SHOOTS THE CRABS SKUTTLING AROUND... I'M DEAD SERIOUS. All she ever does is gets up on a vantage point, and does virtually nothing. You can hear her shooting at times, but at what, I have no idea.For the first hour or so, I kept asking myself... why did I get this game? And then, the question turned into: what the hell is this game even trying to do? I don't understand how or why this game has a sequel. I really don't. I forced myself to play through to see what the hub-bub was about, and was just as disappointed at the end as I was at the start. Easily the longest, least-deserving 3 1/2 hours of my life.A game needs more than interesting visuals and a 'well, they tried' attitude to warrant being as popular and highly praised as this one is. Please avoid at all costs, even if that cost is $1.99. It's not worth it.			"

												Slow paced.  All the weapons have very low magazine capacity and drop when you get hit making them somewhat useless.  Dated graphics, repetitive combat.  Weird atmosphere.   I give this game some points for creativity but I  can't stand playing it much more.			"

												I'm supposed to recommend here, but I'm not. Avoid this game, its just bad. I gave it a chance and beat it (only 2 hours long) and I wanted to like it, but I'm now annoyed because of it. The story makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and the voice actors sound like they weren't even trying. The Only thing this game has going for it is the art style because its a visually unique game and the fighting is decent, but even thats hampered by guns with awkward reloading and firing.			"

												I completed the game and tried bit of the arena, I like the impression it made on me.Don't expect 3rd gen quality. Textures lack a bit here and there, same as the world detail level which is quite simplistic overall but with use of blur, fog, lightning and interesting surreal design the game manages to conceal it perfectly and it definitely works for me. Character design is again simplistic yet amazing and fairly high detailed at some parts.Combat and enemies are bit repetitive but challenging in a good way. Game sets you up against them in slightly different situations and environment and again manages to conceal what it’s lacking.Story is nicely confusing but lacking emotionally a little. Then again it's a surreal universe and who know what mentality and emotional approach people might have there.Music is nothing out of the ordinary and could be better but it corresponds with the action rather well.Game doesn’t seem to suffer from any major bugs, definitely nothing that couldn't be solved with quick load. I got stuck once trough the cause of the whole game and once my enemy got stuck outside of the fight area and I had to bounce grenades of the wall to kill him around the corner as he was out of my reach.This brings us to the level design that is simplistic, linear and not at all open world like but it serves the games purpose. Which in my opinion is to tell a surreal story that you could then tell to your children for not such a good night sleep :) Story is interesting and bit surreal with a solid ending, yet PG12 or less. The game overall is very short which is disappointing, but it includes survival arena like mode for those that would like to experience the game bit more.Overall 7 out of 10. Game is solid but lacks in graphic, music, emotional storytelling, enemies and weapon varieties level design and game length. Seems it is a low budget game, yet it has a similar effect on me that Dreamfall - The Longest Journey or Bioshock had back when I played them - somehow enchanting. It manages to conceal its flaws with overall good concept, solid design and interesting fighting system. It brings a bit of fresh air in to the FPS genre, and with its low price it's a must have.

												Zeno Clash is a first person ""brawler"" set in the most bizarre universe I have ever experienced.  The setting is a tribal culture, and the story revolves around the main character being accused of murder.  Weapons are sparse and primitive; the highlights are definitely on the ""brawling"", fighting hand to hand.  The moves and timing can be hard to learn at first, but beyond the learning curve engagements are very satisfying.  Levels are linear and boss fights are varied in execution.  The visuals and characters though MUST be experienced.  Its a short romp although there are some challenges to complete.  Worth a try for sure.			"

												This game is very unique.  Nothing about this game makes any sense, the story and characters in this bizarro fantasy world are very interesting. And it has some of the best design I've seen in a game, very H.R. Giger inspired. The game is very short and beatable in under 3 hours.The biggest downside is the combat gets pretty repetitive, and you find yourself fighting the same enemies over and over. Still worth a play for the story.			"

												First-person brawler with a heavy dose of surrealism.  The setting and art style are a bit like a 90's TOOL video or Neil Gaiman made-for-TV flic.  The fighting mechanic is.. not bad - but it might be worth playing anyway just for its curious art style.  Not the best brawler out there - but a good, weird change of pace isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Take a look, maybe pick it up in a sale for a strage time punching weird things in the face until they stop punching you in the face.7/10 would punch FatherMother again "

												Zeno Clash is a short, but sweet game that does first-person melee combat better than any other game I've played. The punches, dodges, and kicks all feel like they have real weight and every hit just feels right. Once you've beaten the main campaign, there are some great challenge maps to play, making for good replay value. The campaign is very short (4 hours), but I found it has no filler and every moment is pure gold. Story-wise, Zeno clash is very creative and fun, with lots of interesting characters and twists to it. The visual style is unlike anything I've seen, and is very cool. Overall, you can't go wrong with this game.			"

												Easily one of the most original experiences I've ever seen in a PC game. Making a beat-em-up in a first-person situation was about as clunky as you could imagine, but it came out much better than you'd think. Still, it felt unfair and needlessly frustrating at times. It has a very 80s feel with the design looking like it came out of The Labyrinth and Dark Crystal with the tone of Mad Max and Water World. Zeno Clash is beautifully rendered too with the scenery and chaacter models ooking like they could actually have been made out of clay. The combat, which is the core gameplay, was solid and satisfying despite it's short comings. Never thought I could use the mouse and it feel like I'm really punching somebody! The voice acting is very flat and the story is very shallow, but the story didn't need to be very deep and the awkward voice acting added to the surreal and abstract feel of the whole thing. The music fit the atmosphere and the mood perfectly, similar to Abe's Odysee. I felt like that's probably the sounds you would hear in that universe. Zeno Clash is an easy recommendation for anyone looking for a fresh first person experience with some unique challenge.			"

												I would recommend this except it did have some faults to it. Some of the enemies could be quite easy if you figured out a tactic. Some of the fights were ridiculously hard like the last one you could be killed in practically one hit. I would say I would give this game a 7.5/10 mainly because of those two cons. The storyline was amazing and very surprising at the end,the graphics are surprisingly great and the controls were rather smooth but like I said some of the fights the way they were easy or hard took away from the greatness that this could have been.

												Great game, truly innovative and original in my opinion.  The game grows on you, the more you play, I think the more you'll like it.  The game is an aquired taste but it is like no other in gameplay, presentation, storyline, environment, and overall representation and dialogue, I love it.			"

												A first person Brawler (sometimes Shooter) coated in a pretty weird and cool art style. Could be compared to Chronicles of Riddick gameplaywise but its not nearly as long or indepth - its very linear infact. Never gets boring tho, i mean you can beat up four-titted lizard people, cmon.

I promise you will never have so much fun punching people in the face, oh and you get to fight a boss who throws parachute wearing squirls down at you who he has strapped bombs to and trained to run at enemies... if that does not make you want to play this game I don't know what will.

The story is not bad all although it could probably be better.Zeno Clash is not very long, you could perfectly finish it in one sitting and I REALLY recommend you do.			"

												What could I say about Zeno Clash? It's a first person brawler with some gunplay, in a unique and bizarre world with weird characters, weapons and a similarly strange story. The game itself is quite short, but it's the appropriate length. It's fun. I loved every single minute of it and the tower and the pit bonus adds a little more challenge to the overall moderately difficult game. I recommend it full-heartedly.			"

												Overlooked often. This is a bizarre world, unusual game, and even stranger story. The setting, and most characters, intertwining the events you move through, pretty linear, feels a bit dreamy, stream of conscious, Alice in Wonderland, and frankly, like a freak dream or hallucination.The combat scenarios each have a twist and a few optional weapons but mostly its sock'm and bop'm down which is an oft underused style. No two enemies are exact clones, and the game is so relatively short that the combat won't get stale. Some fights can be more challenging than others but none are really a joke with all quite fun, and a few can be a challenge till you find the tactics and approach.Pretty short with some re-playability but what is there had a lot of attention poured into it. Definitely a refreshing change and change of pace over many games and worth a look for just the art and story alone.			"

												Zeno Clash... Ah Zeno clash... The game is about you (the person who you control) killing you're mother. So you along with a friend try to escape you're siblings, who are angry at you for killing Farther-Mother. You hope for better things  along the way but you soon realise you carn't escape you're siblings. Soon, you find yourself freeing a man-type-creature who has been capture for years. He then helps you get home. Along the way you are hunted down bye the Hunter who the Family paid to kill you. And again, you're siblings. you then return home and fight one on one with Farther-Mother. Thus at the end a big secret is revealed rolling into the second game of the series. I have enjoyed Zeno Clash, but, howether it is not perfect, with buggy fighting controls etc. it is sometimes difficult to fight in Zeno clash, and the short campain but, if you can get past that then it's actually pretty fun.I am ready to play the second one!I'll give the game a 8/10I hope you find this review helpful.

												Zeno Clash is one of those games that I only played for a little bit, but I was glad for it. It's also a game that I might not fully understand, but I'm happy for its mere existence. It's so different and unusual in approach and design, yet it works rather well. Stuff like this proves that games don't all need to be high fantasy or military shooters to work.The combat is simply awesome and sublime. Few games really give me that impression of walloping a mob in the face, but this game definitely delivers. I can feel that satisfying recoil with every hard crack of Ghat's fist, and kneeing a baddie in the face is a treat. Fighting is by no means easy, and some enemies are clever and know how to dodge and counter some of the moves. Others are armored, skillful or just plain weird, and you have to determine the correct approach to damage them effectively. This makes for a very tactical game where you have to be able to plan and improvise your attacks, as well as manage your health and stamina.Weapons are provided, but just don't give that same amount of gratification. Luckily they are only needed for a couple key sections of the main game, and are completely optional at all other times. Most enemies can be beaten with bare knuckles.My only gripe is really the length of the main campaign. It's a bit shorter than I would have preferred, considering the potential depth of the game's mechanics, not to mention the sheer alien beauty of the game's world. If nothing else I wanted to know more and more about the world, its bizarre creatures and history. Maybe this is expanded upon in the sequel. There is, however, an interesting ""challenge"" mode, which consists of a series of matches that get progressively harder, with the player facing various squads of enemies based on characters faced in the main game. Because of it's own length and the difficulties that can be reached, I get the impression that this tower mode is the ""real"" game, and the campaign is more of a lengthy tutorial.This title isn't for everyone. This game requires some good tactical instincts and the combat can be a bit slower-paced that some would prefer, but if you like the tribal-punk setting and enjoy first-person brawling, then you'll get your fix here.

												Fantastic game with a catchy soundtrack and surreal, weird, yet very engaging universe. The whole game is divided in around 20 little scenes, takes you about five hours. It's just the right length. The combat system is nicely done. There are only two big flaws with this game: it's a bit unoptimized (that's caused by the engine), and the voice acting falls short for the worst possible character: your sidekick.Overall, it's one of the best indie games of 2009 and you should definitely play it.

												This game is cleverly designed. I was surprised to find that the first person fist fighting style of the game was executed so well that rather than being put off by the fists flying in front of my face, I ended up becoming absorbed in each fight, physically moving in my chair to dodge left and right. Besides clever game design, the art style is remarkably unique. Characters, landscapes and monsters all look very strange, but always familiar. The story was also unexpectedly good. The protagonist presents the player with an intriguing new perspective. I've never seen similar in any other game. I don't understand why this game isn't more well known. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys surrealist art, anthropology or beating people up.			"

												This game is what inspired the opening lyrics to Macklemore's ""Thift Shop."" He sat down one day and put this game on and he said...""What what, What, what."" and later concluded ""This is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥i n g awesome!"" But seriously, the visuals may be dated, but in my opinion the creativity in the designs and the absolute insanity of it all make it worth playing. Also its cheap these days, and goes on sale often.

												What most games get wrong, this game gets incredibly right. Zeno Clash mixes FPS elements and a heavy combat system to make you feel like the ultimate tribal kung fu badass. The story can seem a bit off at first and the universe takes quite a long time to get fully immersed into. I can understand why the odd creatures and mishapen worlds can seriously throw people off but if you give this game a chance you will not regret it. Besides questionable voice acting and a somewhat short length, Zeno Clash provides enough story, group combat scenes, and boss battles for any fan of both the FPS and Beat-Em-Up genre to feel completely satisfied. Some might be thrown off by the repetitive fighting style that can get a bit old later on in the game but the mixture of shooting peculiar weapons and mutant-like enemies can have you forgetting about any kind of repetition. For anyone that enjoys tribal stories or fantasy adventures, this will truly satisfy all nerdy needs. Zeno Clash gets a Father-Mother assassinating 9/10 from me.			"

												I have been waiting for a very long time for a fantasy-oriented game that demonstrates the level of creativity on display here.  The level of lunacy/genius demonstrated in the design of every single batshit-crazy character/creature/cultural element you encounter in this game is quite possibly best explained as ""astounding,"" and fans of non-standard worlds are going to go nuts for this.  It feels a little bit like ""Planescape vs. Capcom"" or whatever mixture of crazy world-building and punching-dudes you want to think about.Oh, and the game itself is pretty fun, too, even though I certainly never expected myself to spend so much time playing a first-person fighting game (with fish-guns).  And the fighting is actually pretty fun.  But you would definitely play this as much for the atmosphere as for anything else.			"

												With an off-the-wall aesthetic that just barely manages to not completely repulse me, Zeno Clash would be barely worth mentioning at all, if it weren't for the game's aspirations to vastly improve upon the traditional systems of FPS melee combat. Unfortunately the studio just wasn't capable of measuring up to the previous attempts made by Namco, Atlus, and DICE. This relegate's the game's status to interesting sidenote to those with similar aspirations, but is worth little else besides.			"

It's simple, yet hard to follow. Most of the time you'll only have a vague idea of why you're doing something. Despite being only 3 hours long it has a surprising ammount of filler.First person fighting works ok... Until it doesn't. The combat is extremely repetetive but satisfying. Because ""Pick up item"" and ""Lock on enemy"" are the same button, you'll have to fight the controls every time you want to pick something up or try to run away. Guns are an odd addition. They're very out of place. Especially the grenade launcher.Overall, it's fun at first but gets old too quickly.I can't give it a score higher than ""Meh"" out of 10.5/10 "

The story is simple enough you would understand but overall the game feels lacking. The story in itself is quite good and the twist ending does keep things fresh. But now about the gameplay. The gameplay uses melee combat to youre advanted. You bassicly lock onto an enemy and then you beat him up. Of course there are guns you can use but those are worthless because enemys rush you so fast you wont have time to reload them. Overall Zeno Clash is a fresh spin to the FPS genre but i felt that it got boring after a while and the difficulty spikes are a great dissapointment . Overall if you can get it while its on sale go for it but for full price just skip it. I give Zeno clash a 6/10			"

												I don't know why this game get so much hype. Maybe it was OK for 2009, maybe. I got this on a bundle and have been determined to beat it more than once. The problem is its boring. The story is not engaging, the voice acting is awful, and the combat is clunky. As far as I can tell this game was only rated so high because of its wacky visuals. Woo. This is a point to point brawler. You walk some you fight some dudes. You walk some more you fight some more dudes. There are no alternate paths to explore and there will be invisible walls stopping you at every turn. Intermixed with the fighting and walking are ""cut scenes"". In these the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice actors force out their bizarre dialog in such a way you can tell they are confused by what they are saying.The combat is crap. Step forward a little and punch. Either a 3 punch combo by holding left mouse or a strong attack on right mouse. There is also a dodge by pressing space bar and an arrow key while locked into melee. I never found a use for it though. Sure it gives you a chance to counter but it was hard to time right. It was much easier to take a step back, wait for the attack animation to end then walk back up and spam mouse one holds. This tactic works on every character until the end of the game. Trying to use strong attack pretty much always resulted in me getting hit before my attack would launch. Now don't let this make you think I had difficulty with this, I was owning every boring clunky fight. They added some additional fight mechanics towards the end of the game. I don't remember what they were though because I didn't use them.I eventually just gave up my quest to beat this♥♥♥♥♥♥game at the end. I beat the first round of guys easily taking minimal damage. The problem was the two guys on the roof shooting me with crossbows. All I could fight back with was a wildly inaccurate grenade launcher. I tried to lob a couple grenades up at them but the just picked me off easily with shot after shot of highly damaging, rapid fire, homing cross bow shot. I tried to dodge and lob another grenade. Only to watch the ♥♥♥♥ing cross bow bolt follow me and hit me.This is where I gave up. This game isn't worth it, I don't care about the weird♥♥♥♥♥ending or in fact any part about the story what so ever. 4/10, it works, the visuals are cool enough to make you stop and look around for a few seconds, everything else sucks.

												The game was ok, it had it's moments of fun but in the end the combat is to sticky, the story is really non-existant and you figure out the plot twist about 15 minutes into the game and then spend the rest of the game grinding through combat that gets harder and harder. Normally I would say that combat getting harder is a good thing, but in this case they make it harder by adding more enemies into each fight, the designers knew that their really clunky combat system does badly with multiple enemies, its really easy to get trapped in a corner and beaten while someone shoots you from a distance. I finished the game in under 4 hours and about 30% of that time I was trying to make the combat system work smoothly, I dislike broken combat a great deal. Probably an hour or more of the game is taken up with just sitting there and barely doing anything. It tried to be different and it almost succeeded.

												I don't know why this game get so much hype. Maybe it was OK for 2009, maybe. I got this on a bundle and have been determined to beat it more than once. The problem is its boring. The story is not engaging, the voice acting is awful, and the combat is clunky. As far as I can tell this game was only rated so high because of its wacky visuals. Woo. This is a point to point brawler. You walk some you fight some dudes. You walk some more you fight some more dudes. There are no alternate paths to explore and there will be invisible walls stopping you at every turn. Intermixed with the fighting and walking are ""cut scenes"". In these the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice actors force out their bizarre dialog in such a way you can tell they are confused by what they are saying.The combat is crap. Step forward a little and punch. Either a 3 punch combo by holding left mouse or a strong attack on right mouse. There is also a dodge by pressing space bar and an arrow key while locked into melee. I never found a use for it though. Sure it gives you a chance to counter but it was hard to time right. It was much easier to take a step back, wait for the attack animation to end then walk back up and spam mouse one holds. This tactic works on every character until the end of the game. Trying to use strong attack pretty much always resulted in me getting hit before my attack would launch. Now don't let this make you think I had difficulty with this, I was owning every boring clunky fight. They added some additional fight mechanics towards the end of the game. I don't remember what they were though because I didn't use them.I eventually just gave up my quest to beat this♥♥♥♥♥♥game at the end. I beat the first round of guys easily taking minimal damage. The problem was the two guys on the roof shooting me with crossbows. All I could fight back with was a wildly inaccurate grenade launcher. I tried to lob a couple grenades up at them but the just picked me off easily with shot after shot of highly damaging, rapid fire, homing cross bow shot. I tried to dodge and lob another grenade. Only to watch the ♥♥♥♥ing cross bow bolt follow me and hit me.This is where I gave up. This game isn't worth it, I don't care about the weird♥♥♥♥♥ending or in fact any part about the story what so ever. 4/10, it works, the visuals are cool enough to make you stop and look around for a few seconds, everything else sucks.

												One of the weirdest storys I have ever experienced. The graphics are actually okay and the combat feels smooth. The main reason I bought this game was the concept-art that looked awesome, well the game has a very unique style with regard to their characters and the way they introduce themself. All in all it was a pretty short run, like 4 hours of gameplay in the campaign. Afterwards you can beat some challenges, which are pretty boring to be honest. The big surprise of this game was the ending. When I finished the game I was like : ""Wait wat? WHAT????? HAHAHAHAHAHAH"" I dont want to spoil anything. The rest you gotta find out on your own.			"

												I dreaded this moment for a long time. Zeno Clash. Oh my god, Zeno Clash. I don't even know what to say more. This is the most bat♥♥♥♥♥♥insane game I have played. Story takes us to the past (future?) to the Zenozoic. Our hero, Gath, is dead. But he is not, and he killed some being called father-mother, and now half of the friggin world hates him, so he runs away, while having shroom infused dreams of his master which is also dead. And that my friends is not a spoiler. Thats 5 seconds of the game. I won't tell anything more about the story, because for starters its quite good, and besides it doesnt make any ♥♥♥♥ing sence. At all. Gameplay is as basic as it gets. We are running around in beat em up style, throu the linear levels and kicks everything until it stops moving. Here and there we will encounter some kind of diversity (which boils down to doing exacly the same thing, but with weapon). Its a classic beat em up with fps POV. Thats the whole shmuck here! That being said, ZC is HAAAARD. First stages are quite easy, even on harder difficulties, but after about hour in, when all of our moves are unlocked to us (and to our enemies), it gets really insane. AI is really good, it tries to play on our disadvantages by ganging up on us, dodging, blocking, all that kind of stuff. Even weapons can't help us, when we have low health and we get surrounded. And don't even get me started on the whole ""tower"" thing (its basically a survival mode), when they really got carried away with difficulty spike. Graphics... dear lord. Okay, for starters they are really colorful and pleasant for the eyes. We rarelly see any colorless or featureless NPC's or areas. The textures are really well done, sharp and neat, even thou the game is quite old. But then comes the models itself, and the game breaks itself. I mean, jeez, dev team of ZC feed on shrooms and drinks it with liquid LSD or something. Design of most places, NPC's, backgrounds, everything is bizzare and for the most part, ugly as hell. Imagine a person with american football shape head, big ears and nose, and torso the size of half of his head. And thats the most ""plain"" look anyway. My god, we're they doing some heavy drugs while developing this. And the whole game is like that. Music is nice. They are upbeat loops, invigorating us to kick some bizzare♥♥♥♥♥ Here and there we can also hear some slow, almost depresing tunes, mostly in cases of ""despair"" of our hero. Music TBH is the most powerful aspect of the game whatsoever. Sounds are also nice. Punching sounds natural, groaning sounds natural, and the ""vs"" screen have this little ""pow"" sound which gives a vibe of an epic fight. This game is quite honestly really well made. They mixed dead genre with new and modern look, gave it nice story and great gameplay and throwed in. I would definitely reccomend this game to all peeps who loved arcade beat em ups. And to those, which loves bizzare, almost surreal feel of the game. If you dont like those thou, you probably would like to spend your cash somewhere else. Besides, the game is quite hard, and definitely not for ones with slow reflexes. Nevertheless, its worth having Zeno Clash in your library. At least as long as you have patience to beat it. Zawisza out.			"

												Bad voice acting, wonky gameplay, decent graphics (for the time). The story is... Fine, I guess, although nothing brilliant, but the clunky nature of the gameplay (you can't hit them if they are charging a heavy attack, but they can do that to you, really? Bad hit detection in general, slow and repetitive combat, poor AI and pathfinding, you can run past your enemies walk off a ""barricade"" and then get stuck because you can't jump back to the previous section and so cannot kill the enemies to progress, you can hear the hitting sound without doing any damage, if somehow the AI manages to gang up on you you can die in almost no time, since you keep getting stunned and can't land hits before they do, counter-attacks often do not register and so on and so forth), makes it a very unenjoyable experience. It's also really short, 1/3 of the game done in little more than 1 hour.A very forgettable experience, which I cannot recommend to anyone.			"

												I can't exactly recommend this title, for the time it was innovative for the source engine.  However the combat is very clunky, the fights are very repeative and you are in for a mind ♥♥♥♥ of a ""story"".  You will be in pure frustration as you throw your weapons out of the world because you can't jump.  The world and it's characters are incrediably bizarrie and maybe that is the addictive part to seeing the finish.  You aren't invovled with the characters but the ♥♥♥♥ed up world and everything around your character's focus.  You won't play to find out what happens next, but what crazy mechanic are they going to throw at you next.  It is a very short game as well.  For all these reason I can't recommend it.  It will be a memorable game for me just cause of how god damn wierd it was but not for it's fun factor or interesting concept.  Hashbrick unfortunately has no thumbs to give...			"

Remember that line the main character said when he was about to free the Sabretooth Tiger? Yeah, it's worse than that. The plot has as much complexity as a Naruto fanfic.  You also kick chickens. Why? No reason, you just have to. Would I recommend this game? Maybe if you were high all the way through, and didn't mind a control scheme with all of the grace of a drunken cow on a treadmill.

												Regardless of some of the games shortcomings, this game is highly enjoyable with a very pleasurable 1st-person brawler experience makes for some very solid gameplay that is refreshing to enjoy.I want to get right into things and talk about the combat first. The combat is fun and is surprisingly fluid. Probably one of my biggest issues with the combat system is the enemies invicible times. Enemies can always override your attacks but there's a lot of times when enemies will commit to a attack and are completely invincible. Making it so you take unncessary damage and it kind of ruins the flow of the game I found. Sometimes you can't even dodge their attack when executing a perfect dodge to counterattack. But overrall the combat is fair game.In the combat you are either using your bare hands to beat the living snot out of your enemies in a awesome intense fashion, or you're picking their health off with a gun from afar.The combat keeps it very simple with the controls but also makes for some intense fighting. It's really hard to explain how the combat controls work via text over doing a live commentary for example and talking about how they work in the game itself. But the game has a what I'd say fair learning curve with a stiff challenge you may not be prepared for in skill yet. But ultimately you'll learn how to conquer your foes even if it has you going back a chapter or two to do some training. Which really isn't that big of an issue since the fighting in this game is fun as heck. You'll give your old enemies the one-two-puncharoo and you'll pick up some knew combat techniques (skill specifically, the game locks some advanced combat early game. But all results in combat are based on your skill and use of the controls) and be trained enough to learn how to take out tougher enemies.I liked the soundtrack, it wasn't perfect. But it was nice and I can remember a few specific tracks that fit my fancy. They fit the fighting scenarios well and they really helped you get into fights, I give them credit for making soundtracks that pumped me up some in a lot of these battles and levels.The art directive was really strange, I wouldn't say it was memorable or enjoyable persay. But it was interesting to look at and look forward to for their next environments and people. Though I had an issue with the level designs. In the sense of the backgrounds. Everything a little above level eye sight which would be the middle of the screen was sickingly blurry. It was like this in pretty much every level. I had to keep my eyes on the ground and the middle of the screen or I felt sick.The voice acting was poor in it's own right, but that doesn't really matter. Same with the story, the story was kind of weird and didn't really make any sense besides your were just running away from your home because of your actions. But the story and voice acting and art and some of the blurry vision in the levels really pale in how good the action in this game was. I know I didn't do a good job at explaining the combat at all, i'd definitely suggest watching a video of it on youtube. But the action brawling in this game is really good fun. It was an experience I was happy to partake in and i'm glad I played this game. I got this game through trading for it, for it was in a bundle. I heard the game was good and I gave it a try and i'm now here to tell you that is indeed the case. I'd suggest getting it price cut of at least above 5 bucks. Anything below that is just criminal. Though this game is priced at $9.99 or your regional equilivalent and I'd say this game is worth the full price. It's good and I can't say i'd feel bad if I dropped ten bucks on this game. Because even after beating the game there's a challenge mode in-which you beat the crap out of people for numerous amounts of floors and that's jolly good fun too. So anyways, Zeno Clash. If you don't mind a game that is highly action-oriented and with great combat and that's very fast-paced and alive. Get this game, it's really enjoyable.Anyways, thank you for reading my review.

												I have to give this game a serious review because the game itself is almost a big joke. It's only a couple hours long and is therefore objectively a waste of money, but if you can get it for cheap or just play a friends copy then I'd recommend it simply for the really cool melee combat mechanics. There are weird guns and heavy melee weapons but that♥♥♥♥♥♥blows♥♥♥♥♥like the rest of the game and its nonsensical story, bad voice acting, ameteur animation, etc. The one true redeeming quality is the punching and it's worth trying out just to feel how great it is to uppercut chicken men six feet into the air.

The fights started to feel like a chore very quickly and without anything of note between fights, I can't see any reason to play this game.			"

												This game is intense. Possibly due to the fact that every fight I barely make it out because I can't remember the combos, but in any case I love the world and bizarreness of it. It reminds me of the stuff my friends and I would come up with way back when we had... Competitive tobacco smoking sessions. I've seen the reports of repetitiveness but I'm just not actually /seeing/ it myself. Yeah there are repeating character fights but they don't feel recycled as I was lead to believe. And I tend to be rather picky about that so it says something.			"

												Zeno Clash is a uniquely set game with an original storyline. The actors voices are quite funny (done badly) but the graphics are decent for its time. The characters are very original but the combat engine is brutal. Switching from one attacker to the next is badly controlled and running from an opponent is badly designed. It would be better if it was an open world game and you weren't stuck in an arena every time you fought... The game isn't bad but I think its broken.			"

												If you want the deep history and brutal combat system promised by the developers, go to the second part of the game. This game by himself is bad, the history is not deep and without too much sense as almost all the important elements will be in the second part. The first person perspective for battle is OK, but tends to be bad, I had problem in many battles because sometimes the enemies had greater reach and sometimes they didn’t. Although you can carry weapons they are very poorly implemented, and even worse, you magically changes them from scene to scene and his main sin: TOO SHORT, I played 5 hours trying to explore each piece of the levels and the infinite deathmatch but the main campaign can be made in just 2 hours.  But, if you has the second part and want the full experience of the franchises is a good expansion for that game (2 hours of OC, that is an expansion). The graphic  aspect is good (almost perfect), the details are even better and with greater details than the second part.			"

												When you think of ""First Person Brawler,"" you might think ""Oh, that's actually a pretty good idea!"" This game isn't the answer to that. If it had multiplayer, I could fully understand the appeal, but it doesn't even have multiplayer, all it has is a madly hard-to-follow story and interesting visuals. That's all it's merits. Sure it's in a nice niche of quick-time events that you just have to know when to do so, and it might take a fair bit of skill to really get good at it, but you don't have time for that. The entire game feels no different from Call of Duty in the way that along the story, you move forward and OOPS YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER BECAUSE MONSTERS, and then it's just fight after fight, a cutscene that makes zero sense, rinse and repeat, and then the game's over; the only real difference being that in Zeno Clash the guns aren't even guns and your companion does nothing to help you even though she's probably capable. She just stares at you during your short-lived fights and makes no effort to actually drive the thing.All in all, the game is too lacking to get a ""yes"" from me.			"

												This game is meant to be strange, but it's presented in short spurts of gameplay separated with cutscenes both of which could be flashbacks.  The acting in the game plays into the weirdness but other than that the storytelling isn't that great.  The gameplay is kind of interesting at first but once in heavy combat it is more cumbersome than exciting.  The graphics are decent but the sound is often unfitting coming directly from the half-life 2 files.			"

												It literally only took me two and a half hours to beat this game, from start to finish. ON MY FIRST TIME. ON WHAT THE GAME LIKES TO CALL ""HARD MODE"" Unless you're getting this game for something like £1 then I really wouldn't bother, the only good thing I found this game offers is the environment, however it feels so extremely reused most of the time that it loses its charm very fast.In the way of achievements, the game has none that a collector could value. The storyline is also pitiful and doesn't follow through with itself very well. The game actually leaves you on such a huge cliffhanger at the end of the game which refuses to explain anything which just happened, forcing you to buy the sequel to the game to actually find out what the ♥♥♥♥ it is that you just played.In short, don't bother buying this game unless you have some money to waste.

												Do you like to get immersed in the stories videogames tell? Well....... you won't like this game. The horrible voice acting makes it seem fake and just horrible. The game is level based where you have one fight then the level is over, where you don't get to keep the weaponry you had into the next level, sometimes starting a level already holding another completely different weapon. Weaponry against some enemies are extremely underpowered, whereas some enemies they're overpowered. YOU HAVE NO AMMO COUNT, just have to reload after every few shots. It lacks original menus making the game feel like a Half-life 2 mod, which there is no problem with that, but usually mods are free, which is about what this game is worth.			"

												One of my favorite games ever.I loved it because it innovated and took fighting to FPS view - it might not have done so amazingly, but it felt great because it was new and fresh.But the combat is only what led me into the game - not what made me stay. The story and design is what made me stay.Sure - the voice acting is pretty sub par - but with what they got, they painted a amazingly detailed and enthralling world.The characters are unique and interesting and the overall story (once pieces falls into place) is really intruiging.Loved the first one - definitly a recommend - provided you can hold on once the combat charm starts wearing off. if nothing else, do pick this up at a sale.

												Has an intresting concept of first person melee combat and the graphics, cranked on high looks pretty damn amazing.With that being said, the game has a lot of issues. The biggest, which bothers me the most is the fact I cannot for the life of me get it to go to full screen 1080, I am always stuck black boxing this game, when I shouldn't HAVE to. Another issue I've been suffering with is the fact the stupid game will sometimes, out of the blue, just go insane. Walking or running will get stuck, my character will just randomly start running and slam into a wall, whatever. And during a fight with three or more enemies, you just can't have that.It's gotten so bad, for the time being, I've just given up.			"

												I have been playing video games for nearly two decades now and I have never in my disgusting pathetic life played a game with less replay value ever. There is so little replay value that there is, in fact, no play value. This game has terrible controls and I would go as far as to say that it is unsettling to play due to the fact that it is so incredibly bad. It hurt my feelings and I almost punched my best friend in the face when he wanted me to play it again.I didn't like the storyline, the controls, the concept of the game, the HUD, and I now no longer like myself for playing it.I turned down a job offer that could have made me six figures by the time I was 25 and paying money for this game is my biggest regret in my entire life.

												This game is bad. I can't say one thing good about this game, plain and simple.The graphics are bad. I'm not a graphic ♥♥♥♥♥, i don't need every game to have Witcher 3 graphics to enjoy a game, usually i don't even care that much about graphics, but this game's graphics were a pain to look at, ugly and apart from characters everything was bland.Speaking of characters, if you looking for interesting characters with decent backstory, look somewhere else, even russian enemy #128 in a CoD game has a more interesting backstory than this game's characters. And the story is just boring and stupid to be honest. Then you have the sound. Music is forgetful, i don't even remember how the music was. The voice acting was awful, not since the first Resident Evil i've seen such bad voice acting.But i could forgive all that if the gameplay was good, but it's not. It's boring, you just press one buton all the time and is enough to win. Just a 3-hit combo from start to finish.Don't buy this game, just light you money on fire, it will be more amusing.			"

												An absolute gorgeous first-person brawler. The character designs and artwork is straight out of a Jim Henson movie like the Dark Crystal. The fighting mechanics are thought out but never too complicated.  The story mode is very short, about 5 hours or so don't expect an epic story. Speaking of story, this is one of the most bizarre games I have EVER played. Check out the demo, I'm sure you won't regret it.			"

Story is not very long, I beat this on normal/medium in like 8hrs, but hey-- it's an older game with improved graphics, so it is still fun!9/5/10, 4.5/5 stars			"

												Super unique, first-person brawler indie title. The music is odd, story is odd, voice acting is odd, and environments are odd. And yet, I find it charming. Everything is so alienating, but it works to this game's strengths. Makes it stand out, which is probably the reason such a far out concept didn't totally flop.It's interesting, and worth a full playthrough. Gameplay stays fresh throughout with the well-paced difficulty curve, and varied AI for each enemy. Plus, it's been updated several months after release with some new moves and enemies (the update coincided with the XBLA release of Zeno Clash Ultimate or whatever it was called. They're the same, though, so don't worry.)Definitely worth it if it's on sale, though I'm fine having payed $20.			"

It's just so odd, it's hard to fault it for its misteps.I'm just like, yeah, ok, that's weird, let's do this.			"

												This has to be one of the most awkward games I've ever played. I've never seen such a strange form of story telling. Soo far I'm enjoying the game, if not only because I've never seen anything like it before. I can't even fully describe this game because of how awkward it is. I really do enjoy it though. The story telling and graphics are soo odd. The actual combat itself is lots of fun.  First Person melee fighting sounds awkward but it actually works pretty well. I wish the game was a bit easier to be honest. Don't play on hard your first time through thats for sure. ~PR0XIDIAN			"

												It's kind of like if double dragon was an fps, and  it was set in some universe which is so ♥♥♥♥ing outlandishly weird that it manages to make sense in it's own way. The fighting mechanics are quite unique and they feel intuitive but without sacrificing options. I haven't been as impressed by a melee fighting system since Mount and Blade tbh. The story is whacky and entertaining too. Be warned that most the gameplay is brawling against opponents. There's some shooting segments and a part which plays almost like a tower defence kind of thing without towers, but in my opinion the brawling mechanics are good enough to justify the game being mostly just that - brawling.Even if you don't find it completely enjoyable, it's just too weird and unique of a game not to play through to see what it's like.

												While playing the Riddick games, I though ""hey, these games have really good fps fighting mechanics! Actually, I think these games shouldn't even feature weapons at all."" The fps fighting mechanics seemed so great I couldn't even think how someone could improve them.And then I played Zeno Clash, and man, this game is wonderful. There are a few problems (the arenas are too closed - maube they should be bigger, with more space to maneuver -, the stamina is too short), but, in general, this is one of the very few 3d brawlers (like Die Hard Arcade and God Hand) that really capture that ""impact feel"" you get playing games 2d brawlers like Streets of Rage 2, Denjin Makai, Sengoku 3 and other classics. When you give a punch in this game, you can really feel it. Plus, the fights here are crude and dirty: you can kick downed oponents, throw one enemy to another, break huge hammers in their heads...It is a must play, even if it's only for the imaginative visuals. Go punch some Corwids, now.			"

												Zeno Clash is a freaky looking game. The weird abstract and drug-like visuals are a key factor in this. The game is a fighter set in First Person, much like Mirror's Edge. It has a good fighting system and has some various weapons. Controls can be a bit sluggish, but they're not too bad. Zeno Clash has a refreshing look and nice gameplay for a good single player experience.			"

												This game is nearly as unique as its environment. It's a first person puncher set int a world that nobody has seen before. It has the potential to change your nightmares and dreams just by looking at the first level. But they didn't stop at just making everything look amazing and unique. They instead went further, making it an excellent fighitng game. While some parts are poorly made, the vast majority of the game is excellent and due to the relatively bite sized episdes of the game, you'll never find yourself hating the game over these small frustrations. If you don't trust me, at least try the demo and you'll see how much stress relief there is for punching a bird in the face. Over and over.			"

												This game is just weirdly addicting. I enjoyed the art style, although very strange, and I thought that the combat was satisfying. Although it's fairly short, I was happy with the game over-all and it left me wanting to play the second game. The story is very weird and possibly off putting to some, (warning: you will fight the same people over and over, but in different circumstances and with new challenges added in) but it comes together in the end fairly well and can be challenging at times.  Seeing as like only 5 guys made this game I was thoroughly impressed and glad that I played it. I'm looking forward to playing the second installment in the coming months. I got them both on a Humble Bundle sell and so far my money was definitely well spent.			"

												ZenoClash is one of those rare games in the industry which doesn't just play follow the leader. It is a truely innovative game and I found it to be a very enjoyable experience. To briefly describe the gameplay, imagine a wrestling game crossed with a first person shooter and dipped in a vat of Salvador Dali's immagination. Basically there are a series of battles in which you use your fists, kicks, grabs and sometimes weapons, both melee and ranged. The systems are complex and feel really rewarding when mastered.  Some may find the systems a little difficult to master, I know it took me several hours of gameplay to begin to feel competent. If you enjoy a challenge that shouldn't put you off this game.The setting is spectacular, very odd and unique and not an art style you see in many games. The world is rich and although there is not a lot of story the world itself and the design of the world makes the game a richer experience.Ran out of room, verdict, BUY IT!			"

The fantastical setting is something truly special and left my jaw hitting the floor more than once. Overall the story is earnest with some occasional understated dark humour, and the action (strong emphisis on melee) satisfyingly brutal, if occasionally janky/frustrating (unless I just suck :p).

												Imagine if Dr.Seuss' muddle puddle tweetle poodle beetle noodle bottle paddle battle was real, and more like Thunder Dome from Mad Max. Now you've got Zeno Clash.It's a highly stylized first person brawler. It feels kind of odd to put that much detail and style into something that you don't look at while you punch everyone, but when you have time to stop to smell the blood spattered roses, it's a nice looking place. The story is a bit meh, and just goes so deep into this worlds bizzare lore that it gets a bit muddled. Really it's just for playing through once and going ""well that was interesting"", then never touching it again.Lets hope Zeno Clash 2 is better.On the other hand, if Zeno Clash 2 is set in the same world, maybe playing this just to get into the lore would be a good idea.

												Zeno Clash. I'll have to admit I only picked up this game because it was insanely cheap (£0.59) . Having no expectations for the game or no prior knowledge about the game I was presently surprised by what this game had to offer. The story of this game is so damn trippy you will need to buy this game yourself to experiance its awesomely weirdness. The best part about Zeno Clash is its combat system. It is a beat em up but in first person. You can do a variety of punches ranging from jabs to HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥YOU JUST MADE THAT GUY FLY ACROSS THE SCREEN. When you successfully pull off harder punches you get a sastifying crunch as you see your enemies face turn into jelly. There are also some guns in the game which are really awkward and are no where near as sastifying to use. I'd recommend this game to people looking for something different it is a short game but baring in mind I got it really cheap on a steam sale im sure you could aswell.			"

												The way I see it, there four strong reasons to get this game:1) The art style is gorgeous. The set design is great and the environments are enormously varied from chapter to chapter and scene to scene. It is thematically coherent but at the same time constantly surprising. Many of the locations are designed to evoke feelings, and are very immersive.2) The story is involving! The plot is cohesive and engaging. The characters are well-written and multifaceted, with growth over the story arc. It didn't take long for me to find myself showing concern for the wellbeing of these characters, in particular that of the female lead.3) Game mechanics are different. Although this game is at heart an FPS, most of your combat will be brawling. The melee fighting system is different but interesting, and challenging enough to keep you interested through the game.4) Source Engine! Yes Zeno Clash uses the same engine as HL2. It's familiar, you know how it acts, and it feels right.Recommended.			"

The execution [of everything] isn't perfect, but it still beats most of things ever AMG's Alice included.

I really enjoyed the game, though it's mostly an on-rails experience.Doing the ladder missions is really awesome and gives you a lot of room to experiment with all the different melee attacks you've learned throughout the game.I'd recommend this game to anyone even at full price.

												Zeno Clash is a weird game.  ""Weird"" is definitely the best adjective to describe it.  It's an odd game with odd characters in an odd world.  The game is made in the Source Engine, but the visuals are strikingly different from other games from the same engine, like Half Life 2 or Vampire: The Masquerade.  The game is a string of arcade-esque fights with guns and fists, all in first-person.  Zeno Clash is actually one of the only games to do fist fighting correctly in first person, and it does it well.  While Zeno Clash is very short, the story clocking only three to four hours, it does have a challange mode and varying difficulty levels.  Even if it costs too much at full price, it's undoubtably worth it on sale.			"

												An excellent Indie-Game based on the Source Engine with gripping first-person melee combat and a deep storyline set in a stone age fantasy world. Unfortunately the voice acting (luckily english only) is not as good as you could be familiar with from other games. Another disadvantage is the fact that shooter experienced players can finish it in 5 hours (or less). There is a challenge mode where you can proof your melee combat skills and allows you to post your highscore in your Steam Friends network.If you are looking for some hours of fun, excitement and brawl in an odd fantasy world, Zeno Clash is _the_ game for you xD "

												Zeno Clash is a First-Person-Fighter whose faults (including short playtime--I did it in about 3 hours--and sometimes irritating combat) are well outshone by its strange visuals and setting. Zeno Clash uses Fantasy to its best potential and rather than stuff more Orcs, Elves, and Dwarves down your throat it comes up with a wholly unique setting that is both striking and at time mesmerizing. To give you an idea of what the game is really like, I'll quote my favorite piece of dialogue. ""The Corwids are not slaves of reality; so they can be insane... Here I met Oxameter. Oxameter just walks in a straight line without letting anything change his path, and that's what Oxameter does. There was also Helim. Helim needed to be invisible, so he removed the eyes from anything that could see him.""			"

												I really recommend it for having a fascinating style, funky story, and just to see that First-Person-Beat-Em-Up (FPBEM?) can be done well! :DA much better solo ""FPS"" challenge experience than lots of other gamesI've played like all the CODs etc.It's a real shame there are no co-op modes on the PC though (only on 360) but I don't want to pay the inflated 360 price just for those few extra co-op levels :(			"

												This is a beat 'em up with a story that you very mildly interact with. - essentially linear, with no puzzle-solving elements whatsoever except ""how do I trash this guy's face."" Its fighting mechanics are very sophisticated and nuanced, however, and the battles are genuinely challenging. If you saw the rich world and were hoping for some kind of RPG - well, you don't get one. However it has a very pretty world to admire, essentially being more valuable as an art piece than a game, and it is definitely worth a playthrough. It is fairly short, however, only being an afternoon's diversion.			"

												Zeno Clash can be summarized in two words - freaky weird. Imaginative setting that somehow manages to give the impression that you've only just scratched the surface of the world of Zenozoik (and beyond) along with its eerily disturbing and eccentric characters result in a unique experience overall. That's not to say everything deserves praise though, especially in the mechanics department. First-person melee combat is awkward especially with its overreliance on somewhat stubborn focus mode that takes some time getting used to in order to avoid frustration. Not to mention how short the game is, probably as a result of obviously being ACE Team's first effort and consequence their choice to go for a surreal one-time experience.			"

												One of the most unique experiences I have had in gaming.  And that is what it is, an EXPERIENCE.  With some truly bizarre and surreal character and world design, Zeno Clash is a unique and original game that is unlike any other game that I have experienced.- The campaign ran me less than hours, so it's a short game.- Some of the voice acting is under-par, but the character designs and mysterious story is more than enough to make up for it.- The gameplay is competent.  Nothing to write home about, but it was neat.  The first-person melee combat took some getting used to, but you will catch on pretty quick.It is an older game, but if you can catch it for under $10, I would recommend picking it up.			"

												This game made me feel uneasy, it's like schitzoprenic dream where everything looks just wrong. If you want this kind of experience then i can recommend it. It's rather short, took only 4 hours to complete, but for this kind of game it fits perfectly. The story is interesting but too linear. Combat system feels little bit of, it feels like it would work better on gamepad (which is only partially supported), so I hope they fixed that on the second game. The saving system gave me some trouble, as it autosaves between battles, so few occasions I had saves where I had only few hitpoints left and there were some guys shooting me dead right after loading the game, nothing serious but in worst case you could loose lot of progress. Voice acting is... well for an indi game it's ok I guess, Its art game.			"

The story is sporadic, though. The combat can be broken into two points. Gunplay = Source. No problems. Melee is suprisingly deep and more than a little difficult to adjust to, but when you're double-fistwrecking fools like a pro, it feels comfortable.Play this game. A tremendous stepping stone for the indie genre.			"

												A true gem! Apart from the obvious ""wtf"" aspect of the art style (contestant for the best use of Source 2date imo) & the bizarre characters & story, this game has a hand 2 hand combat system that can put 3A titles to shame. While ranged and melee weapons are present the heart of the combat lies in good ol' fist fights, where you have to be thinking on your feet in order to survive. It is amazing how they've managed to make each part of the h2h combat system tacticaly valid, esp block/evade where usualy one option tends to overshadow the other. Hits also have some ""weight"" to them as opponents will react accordingly to each thumping blow.  Another + is the iclusion of a tower mode where you'll be focusing solely on the combat. Only drawback is the game's length: approx 5 hrs for the sp story. All in all one of the most unique games out there. Def give this 1 a shot!			"

												Zeno Clash is a weird game.  ""Weird"" is definitely the best adjective to describe it.  It's an odd game with odd characters in an odd world.  The game is made in the Source Engine, but the visuals are strikingly different from other games from the same engine, like Half Life 2 or Vampire: The Masquerade.  The game is a string of arcade-esque fights with guns and fists, all in first-person.  Zeno Clash is actually one of the only games to do fist fighting correctly in first person, and it does it well.  While Zeno Clash is very short, the story clocking only three to four hours, it does have a challange mode and varying difficulty levels.  Even if it costs too much at full price, it's undoubtably worth it on sale.			"

												An excellent Indie-Game based on the Source Engine with gripping first-person melee combat and a deep storyline set in a stone age fantasy world. Unfortunately the voice acting (luckily english only) is not as good as you could be familiar with from other games. Another disadvantage is the fact that shooter experienced players can finish it in 5 hours (or less). There is a challenge mode where you can proof your melee combat skills and allows you to post your highscore in your Steam Friends network.If you are looking for some hours of fun, excitement and brawl in an odd fantasy world, Zeno Clash is _the_ game for you xD "

												Where to begin, Zeno Clash I guess I Can consider a First Person Brawler with some shooter elements. It shows the perfect example towards independent game development, and proves itself in many ways. The game is fast paced, fun, albeit short, its enjoyable and can be played through more than once. I Did not expect it to be so fun, and was actually disappointed when the game ended. The Challenge mode is welcomed and even though the story is laid out for you except for that one secret, even when it is spoiled in the end, It was a little anti-climatic for myself. The Atmosphere is perfect for the mood they are capturing, Which I personally am still trying to figure out but they did it well. Beautiful, Unique, fun and fast, you can't ask much else from games now a'days, Zeno Clash is worth trying, by everyone, and the developers earn much praise for building such a game, if Zeno Clash had Multiplayer Death Matches, I Feel it would be quite the hit! Overall Zeno Clash is a great game.			"

												The first reaction that I had by beginning Zeno Clash was ""what the ♥♥♥♥ is that thing????!"". At the very end of the game, I was like “what the ♥♥♥♥ did I just play ????”The story takes place in a strange world mixing Prehistory and Fantasy, Zenozoik, and where the hero, Ghat, avoids his family having propped up its ""father"" together with Deadra, his girlfriend, who sticks him throughout the adventure. To there, everything goes well.Except that the ""Father"", named ""Father-mother"" in the story, is a sort of mutant bird-human of 3 meters high, and that your ""brothers"" and ""sisters"" can be as well normal human beings as mutants human -lizards / birds / ogres / pigs / elephants / bear / insert here the animal of your choice...So we control Ghat during his trip, during which he is going to meet, besides the members of his beautiful family: explosive squirrels, mutants-pigs / cats even musicians, specters-zombies throwing blue fireballs, crabs, murderer... Yes the bestiary is rather wide. And we can even kill pets, as the chickens or the pigs, with a good kick in the belly; it is an achievement on Steam.More seriously, Zeno Clash is a game of fight; the fights will be generally launched by a big avatar with "" X VS Y "" as in a Tekken, Street Fighter and others.There are about 18 levels, very short. About 4 hours are required to see the end of the game at the normal level. Add 1 hour to make the Challenge mode, which is a Tower full of the various enemies you have met during the campaign mode.There are some weapons (sword, hammer, crossbow, pistols, rifle, grenades), which will be useful in some situations (snipers, big guys). But, between us, the fights will take place essentially hand to hand. Because it is funnier, more interesting and more powerful.The game is easy to understand, I played the Normal level, but I would be able to start with a higher difficulty without problems. You just have to use the fight tricks (counter-attack, dodging…) which are explained to us in the first levels, and it will be easy.The universe is very nice, graphics and musics are good. The scenario is correct, but it will let you perplexed.Conclusion: A weird game. But a good game.			"

												Zeno Clash is a fantastic first person fighter in a truly oddball setting. In Zeno Clash, you play as Ghat, one human in a tribe of varying races raised by the asexual creature ""father mother"". After attacking Father Mother, you and your surprisingly loyal ""beetle antlers-in hair"" girlfriend Deadra, have to fight to survive after Father Mother's children come after you.It's a simple story, and Zeno Clash is a odd game in a strange, strange world populated by animal hybrid creatures, odd weapons made out of animal bones and beautiful scenery straight out of an acid trip.Despite all of that oddity though, the game itself is rather easy to get your head around. It's a first person fighter based around punches, kicks, combos, timing and defensive tactics over super moves or memorizing long combos. You will occasionally find weapons which you can use ranging from giant bone swords. to dual fish pistols. to even a really cool rifle made of bone and animal parts. You can use these pretty much for the entirety of a fight as they have infinite ammo (Unlike in Zeno Clash 2), but despite the occasional mandatory weapon section that betrays the game's source engine roots, Zeno Clash is still very much a first person brawler. The combat feels straight up visceral and impactful with just about every swing, block or throw you make. At times it feels a tad sluggish, The combat is fun, but my favorite element of the (admittedly linear) game is exploring this absolutely crazy world. What's interesting about Zeno Clash's setting is that it doesn't seem to be just contrived of an acid trip, genuine world building has been done here and it shows. Areas range from market towns full of thieves to outlands full of sky high elephant-giraffe-anteater-things, to a few areas I would actually rather not spoil, but every one feels fleshed out and varied.Did I mention the game is gorgeous by the way, even now? Colors seem to fade, merge and pop in a way only water color paintings can. This game has some of the prettiest skyboxes I've ever seen, especially for a source game. Overall, the art design is rather excellent. Just about every character, weapon, and creature feels perfectly in line with game's oddball style.It is the first game by an indie studio, so it's not without its rough spots. The voice actor for Deadra isn't all that great, small parts of the combat like recoveries feel a little sluggish, and the limitations of the source engine occasionally crop up, like rather small levels and loading screens halfway through areas. The fish pistols have this odd bug that still has yet to be fixed where the bottom row of bullet indicators is cut in half on the interface. The FOV is non-adjustable, although this is probably to add to immersion and because it changes mid-game actually mid combat. (This is a game where you can see your own feet, it is aiming for immersion.)Overall, Recommendation: If you even think you might like this, buy it. It's cheap at $10 and is well worth your time to at least play through the campaign once. If you are unsure, wishlist it and wait for a sale, as it usually drops down really, really low in price.If you are wondering about cost to time spent ratio, the campaign is about 4+ hours long, but there's tons to go back and see. There's also a Challenge tower that I didn't bother too much with but you may find intriguing.			"

												The combat is great, albeit very simple, the level design is good, and often pits you against interesting enemy/weapon combinations, everything is fun to use, everything looks great, and everything sounds great. The melee/ranged combat balance is very well done, and the game never gets dull.Now that the good bits are out of the way, let's go straight to the bad/disappointing bits.-The world of Zenozoik looks absolutely fantastic, mostly due to its very unusual, colorful and all-out insane art style.This causes a bit of a problem, which I guess is a very good problem to have : I want to see more of it ! Talk to characters, explore the wilderness , discover weird locations and even weirder inhabitants !Unfortunately, Zeno Clash is a very linear and straightforward game. You move forward, have an enemy encounter, you beat them up, and you repeat until the end of the level.I really wish the game was a standard FPS or had RPG elements that would allow me to explore it. It's such a shame to see what could be an amazing world to explore reduced to a pretty backdrop.-The game is pretty short, it took me about 3.5 hours to finish, without the challenges. This isn't really a problem as i feel it has quite a bit of replay value.-The voice acting is bad. Admittedly, it's bad in a cute way, like Deus Ex but a tad worse. The random use of made up    words like ""kak"" and ""tef"" don't help.-The boat level is boring. Fortunately it barely lasts 2 minutes, but you spend them looking left and right shooting at sand people who are throwing rocks at you.-There is a weird stutter when you move your mouse, it's not very noticeable but nonetheless annoying.-Unskippable cutscenes-The FOV is broken, but I made a guide to fix it : 


Zeno Clash FOV fix ! 
A Guide for Zeno Clash
By: telopots

			Here's a fix for the fov in Zeno Clash !		


Unique, well crafted, and (almost) never boring, the game was a fantastic experience. I enjoyed (almost) every bit of it, and I will probably replay it again at some point.			"

												The fictional world of Zenoizoik is a strange one -- a hybrid of Mad Max dystopia and Flinstones outlandishness. But this first person fighter presents a world as cruel as it is fascinating. You play Ghat, a man on the run for murdering his own family. But it's soon revealed that there are secrets that even blood cannot hide. The result is a fighting game that is all things original, challenging and satisfying, wrapped in a story that is nothing short of an interactive acid trip.			"

												There are no words to properly describe how deeply bizzare this game is. The setting is outlandish, the story is walking the edge of complete insanity and the characters are probably the strangest albiet the most well imagined I've ever seen in a game.That said, the brawler combat is quite fun and, although the play through is rather short it is a fun and memorable experience. I'm really glad I played this game.			"

												Zeno Clash was developed by ACE Team, an entertainment software developer based in Santiago, Chile.  They're committed to making unique games that stand out for their originality and quality.  Zeno Clash is exactly that; the use of the Source engine makes for excellent graphics and  a quality feel, while it's unique art style, story line, and melee combat system really sets this game apart from your typical half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥console port.JohnCover gives you his recommendation.

												This is a First Person Brawler with a simple combat system, original and out of the ordinary art style. Featuring a 2-3 hour story mode and another hour of challenges. Graphics: The game uses the Source engine (Half Life 2) so it has limited but memorable scenes. The art style is astonishing and  aestheticly looks like a wierd dream. I really want to see the concept arts or a sketchbook from the creator. Technically the game looks okay. There are low res textures, jerky shadows and low poly stuff. But the caracter design, the weapons and the environment...man this game looks and feels really uniqe. Sound: The music just like the graphics fullfills this wierd dreamy athmosphere. There are many memorable moments thank to the great combination of them. Voice acting is cheesy but funny. The dialogues are genuinely funny and serious at the same time. The sound effects are basic public domain stuff.  Gameplay: Gameplay wise well... it's simple. The main scenario is arena fight. You get to a locked area and you have to defeat all the enemies. Imagine these like nodes in a graph. These nodes are connected by edges that are basically linear paths. And overall the game is linear and the level design is linear too. There is a turret section as well but still has the stong dreamy athmosphere so it's okay. You will encounter little enemies, normal enemies, normal enemies with weapons (melee, ranged), brutes and bosses.The little enemies are crabs, chickens and those big rabbit thingys. I think most of them just spit you acid liquid. Normal enemies are basically fighting partners. These guys can pick up weapons as well. Enemy vaiety is nice here because there are different models and fighting styles. Brutes are big, tough enemies and you better kill 'em with melee weapons. They take multiple hits as well. Bosses are easy battles, just like old times: wasd 'em and shoot 'em.You can shoot only in ADS otherwise you swing the weapon towards the enemy. You can throw the weapons as well. Mechanically these are the same as in other games but they feel strange and uniqe in a positive way.The melee system is simple and easy to learn. There are basic combos and advanced combos. The game does a good job teaching you these things in the tutorial sessions. There is a challenge tower for pro players. It's basically a fight fest. You have to climb the tower and defeat all the enemies. Things could get hard here... :) Replayability: As I mentioned the Singleplayer story mode is linear and each replay will be the same. But if you liked the story and the wierd things in it, I'm sure you'll give it another go. However the Challenge Tower is pure gameplay and fun and absolutely replayable.  Overall:  Pros:  Short but entertaining Singleplayer mode Visceral combat Simple and fun melle system Uniqe aesthetics Interesting art style Dreamy music Cons:  Short Singleplayer mode Lack of MP features Mediocre sound effects Nothing special in technical level Linear levels Verdict: A nice game from the indie developer, Ace Team. I had great fun with it. I recommend this game for those who like fighting games, wierd fiction, and for those who's time is short and want a short game.  "

												Take Mad Max, Dragonheart, and the Island of Dr Moreau and blend them all together and you'll come up with a game called Zeno Clash. The combat takes place from a first person perspective and allows for complex moves such as dodging and parrying. You get the option of using either your fists/melee or guns in most battles although some will limit you to one or the other. Story-wise, this game is pretty simplistic but the level and character design more than make up for it with some absolutely stunning yet totally bizarre visuals. The only detractor from the overall experience is that the voice acting is a bit corny and the game is fairly short. Definitely worth picking up at a fair price.			"

												At its core, Xeno Clash is a spiritual successor to arcade beat-em-up games. What sets it apart is the unique, fully-realized world and story the game punctuates the action with in scripted cutscenes and flashbacks that slowly reveal the central mystery of the plot. The game is powered by the Source engine, and true to its linage, the character work in these scenes is top-notch.The action in Xeno Clash takes place in the first-person, and you chain together punches and throws to form combos, while dodging the enemies' own swings. Besides hand-to-hand combat, you can also scoop up weapons dropped by your foes, such as pistols, a rifle, and grenades. Enemies usually come in waves, but you can easily lock your focus to a specific foe.The game itself is rather short, and can be finished in a few hours. There's a series of challenge levels to give the game some replay value. But Xeno Clash's presentation, artwork, and story differentiate enough that any gamer should give it a shot.			"

The combat does get repetitive, but it's still fun. The game introduces what could be an extremely wonderful series, but as of yet nothing else has come from the developers.			"

												Zeno Clash is a pretty good game. The world, as well as the artwork, is very unique. The story mode won't take you long to finish, though the game does offer challenge mode(which I have yet to explore). The combat system is an interesting facet of the game, allowing the player to target enemies to fight hand-to-hand with a choice of basic or power punches, as well as a block/dodge/counter system. The game also affords the player a couple of club weapons, as well as ranged weapons(with quite interesting design). That being said, it does feel shallow at times, and the targetting system has it's hiccups. The voice acting is well done for the most part(father-mother being nicely conveyed). Overall, a nice game. It doesn't provide too much content but offers enough of it in a unique, and quite refreshing way.			"

												One of the most unique experiences I have had in gaming.  And that is what it is, an EXPERIENCE.  With some truly bizarre and surreal character and world design, Zeno Clash is a unique and original game that is unlike any other game that I have experienced.- The campaign ran me less than hours, so it's a short game.- Some of the voice acting is under-par, but the character designs and mysterious story is more than enough to make up for it.- The gameplay is competent.  Nothing to write home about, but it was neat.  The first-person melee combat took some getting used to, but you will catch on pretty quick.It is an older game, but if you can catch it for under $10, I would recommend picking it up.			"

												The first reaction that I had by beginning Zeno Clash was ""what the ♥♥♥♥ is that thing????!"". At the very end of the game, I was like “what the ♥♥♥♥ did I just play ????”The story takes place in a strange world mixing Prehistory and Fantasy, Zenozoik, and where the hero, Ghat, avoids his family having propped up its ""father"" together with Deadra, his girlfriend, who sticks him throughout the adventure. To there, everything goes well.Except that the ""Father"", named ""Father-mother"" in the story, is a sort of mutant bird-human of 3 meters high, and that your ""brothers"" and ""sisters"" can be as well normal human beings as mutants human -lizards / birds / ogres / pigs / elephants / bear / insert here the animal of your choice...So we control Ghat during his trip, during which he is going to meet, besides the members of his beautiful family: explosive squirrels, mutants-pigs / cats even musicians, specters-zombies throwing blue fireballs, crabs, murderer... Yes the bestiary is rather wide. And we can even kill pets, as the chickens or the pigs, with a good kick in the belly; it is an achievement on Steam.More seriously, Zeno Clash is a game of fight; the fights will be generally launched by a big avatar with "" X VS Y "" as in a Tekken, Street Fighter and others.There are about 18 levels, very short. About 4 hours are required to see the end of the game at the normal level. Add 1 hour to make the Challenge mode, which is a Tower full of the various enemies you have met during the campaign mode.There are some weapons (sword, hammer, crossbow, pistols, rifle, grenades), which will be useful in some situations (snipers, big guys). But, between us, the fights will take place essentially hand to hand. Because it is funnier, more interesting and more powerful.The game is easy to understand, I played the Normal level, but I would be able to start with a higher difficulty without problems. You just have to use the fight tricks (counter-attack, dodging…) which are explained to us in the first levels, and it will be easy.The universe is very nice, graphics and musics are good. The scenario is correct, but it will let you perplexed.Conclusion: A weird game. But a good game.			"

I felt an instant connection.The gameplay itself is intersting and challenging enough, but can be a little frustrating and sluggish at times. Overall I think ACE Team did an exceptional job in creating such a unique game that anyone should at least have played once.It's a shame they will probably never get enough resources to build their true vision of this game, a full-fledged sandbox RPG set in the open world of Zenozoik.

												Good game. Heres some cons and pros..Pros:+ Gameplay is fun.+ First person hand to hand is unique and haven't seen it in other games.+ Story is a bit confusing, but interesting.+ Enemies are all unique and have their own attack sets.+ Graphics are not too bad considering it came out 6 years ago.+ The choice of guns is nice.+ character design is unique and interesting, no two enemies feel alikeCons:- Theres no way to really deal with multiple enemies at once. - Guns have unlimited ammo, so using one can defeat the purpose of hand to hand.- the locking system is flawed, hard to switch between enemies without accidentally turning off.- The fighting combos are a bit limited, gets a little repetive.- Areas are linear, a little open world feeling would be nice. - If enemies get a hold of a gun, they can really do some damage and theres no way of avoiding gunfire. - No replay value whatsoever - awkward animation (sort of like the first Fable)It seems over priced at $9.99. If you don't mind the price, get it. It's best to try and catch it on sale though. Glad I got Zeno Clash 2 Special edition for a mere 5 bucks. Overall a solid 7/10.			"

												Zeno Clash is fun, surreal, and short game that's worth the price. The combat works well with a focus on melee, but it incorporates weapons in a way that balances out the combat.The game is short though. I beat it in 3.5 hours without trying to get the achievments, but it does have a challenge mode where you fight multiple rounds of enemies. Since the fighting is so much fun the challenge mode adds a lot in terms of time you will be playing it.Aesthetically every character and location is as surreal as the trailers show, even their voices and manner of speaking have quirky qualities to them, though it could get iritating.Still it is worth the price.

												A very wierd but very fun little game.  There aren't alot of first person adventure/fighting games out there - probably for good reason - the mechanics are a bit strange and hard to get used to, but they can be alot of fun once you get into the swing of things.The real highlight for this game, however, is the colorful and original world it is set in.  The blurb calls it ""punk-fantasy,"" which falls pretty short of quantifying just how oddball this game is.  The strange characters, fantastic creatures, and bizzare weapons all feel like they are referencing a deep and well established mythology - but one that is almost entirely alien to me.There are a few issues with focus and pacing but overall this is a great game that is worth the $15 sticker price.  8/10			"

												Where to begin, Zeno Clash I guess I Can consider a First Person Brawler with some shooter elements. It shows the perfect example towards independent game development, and proves itself in many ways. The game is fast paced, fun, albeit short, its enjoyable and can be played through more than once. I Did not expect it to be so fun, and was actually disappointed when the game ended. The Challenge mode is welcomed and even though the story is laid out for you except for that one secret, even when it is spoiled in the end, It was a little anti-climatic for myself. The Atmosphere is perfect for the mood they are capturing, Which I personally am still trying to figure out but they did it well. Beautiful, Unique, fun and fast, you can't ask much else from games now a'days, Zeno Clash is worth trying, by everyone, and the developers earn much praise for building such a game, if Zeno Clash had Multiplayer Death Matches, I Feel it would be quite the hit! Overall Zeno Clash is a great game.			"

												Zeno Clash is a First Person Brawler, as hard as that sounds to believe.  Each of the stages are set up as fights between you and enemies, all of which start off with a Street Fighter ""VS"" screen.  The game also features a couple of weapons, although they are usually used as utility to the actual fist fighting.  The game does actually have a story, although I'm not even going to try to explain it.  The artstyle is unique as well, combining tribal looks with a bit of smashed together 20th century sculpture.  The game is short, but also features an optional tower mode where you have to fight floors of enemies and progress up without dying.  If you like quirky indie games, you'll probably get a kick out of the few hours Zeno Clash offers.			"

												Think ""Double Dragon FPS in a strange alien world"" and you're pretty much there. This games combat system is amazing in its simplicity: Punches, kicks, grapples, parries, dodges and counters are all possible using standard FPS controls. Much like any traditional beat 'em up, the game consists of a simple story presented in a series of stages. Various items are at your disposal, such as unlikely firearms, 'skullbombs' and health pickups.An example of how fights play out: 


YouTube™ Video: Zenoclash: Gateway Brawl 

			Views: 24		

			Gameplay video for one of the first fights in Zeno Clash.		

The art style is absolutely crazy, the city of Halstedom being a prime example: A chaotic mishmash of various structures that all seem to be made out of different materials. Much like the city, no two characters look alike. Out of all the wierd alien creatures you'll find, there are a few visibly human specimens, but even they all look completely different.Highly recommend if you enjoyed those oldschool beat 'em ups.

												When discussing what games can do as a medium of expression, I tend to lean towards either the mechanics as meaning or just an excellent sense of place arguments. Zeno Clash is definitely the latter, creating a world that though has existed in visual expressions before but hasn't been covered in video games.Whether fighting pig people in a Dr. Suess-esque capital city, or shooting sand people with your fish gun on a boat trip, Zeno Clash provides you with more visually stunning environmnets that I've only seen rivaled in Morrowind and Bioshock.

												It's a weird, frustrating, repulsive and beautiful game that will stick with me for a long time. It's not like anything you've played before, from the brawling gameplay to environments that seem drawn alternately from dreams, '60s sci-fi, and the artist getting sunstroke at a busy farm. The game is suggestive and evokes more than it tells, but there seems to be an underlying logic to the enigma of a story on which the game's journey is built. I highly recommend this game. It's cheap, and worth the 5-6 strange hours you'll put into it.			"

												*Possible Spoilers Below, but not really*Punched my way to the literal end of the earth and back in about 3 hours.Enjoyed every second of it. Dont let the short length fool you. This is a fun pc beat em up shooter thing!A few fights are quite tough, the weapons are interesting, your female sidekick has smoking hot legs and gives you something to stare at while out and about doing your thing, and the story didnt really confuse me at all, there are some things not explained and im sure the sequel will adress those things but what you are presented with while weird, does eventually peace together, leaving some remaining questions after the cliff hanger ending. LIKE!Why does this world even exist in the first place, and why so many strange creatures along side humans.What exactly was mother father doing before the intro scene that kicks all this stuff off, i mean sure we get a semi answer, but still. Like what? Wheres the motive.Are the 2 main characters going to get it on and have like a son or something. Im sure theres already fan fiction of that. Wouldnt shock me.How many punches would it take to get to the centre of the planet? ID LIKE TO KNOW!And what are all those things we were promised info on in the end of the game, sequel perhaps? (downloading the second game as i type this)ANYWAYS, silly questions about a silly but entertaining plot aside. Just uh, buy this ok. Seriosly get both. I want a third game. I want a nice ZENO TRILOGY, to come back to and enjoy. 2 OUT OF 3 FOLKS. JUST ONE MORE GAME AND THE DREAM WOULD BECOME REAL! LEZ GO NOW!			"

												A pretty short first-person-beat'em-up-and-shooter.The beating people up and shooting at them part is pretty solid. The hand-to hand combat itself is decent and requires some skill, certainly more than we have seen in games like the Batman or the Assasins Creed series. You also get some blunt weapons which you can use, as well as some guns. There isn't a whole lot of the guns, but they all feel and act quite different, which helps vary the gameplay up a bit. Not that the gameplay is in need of that, the hand to hand combat is actually impressively immersive, I just really appreciate variety in gunplay ^^The game itself has a very odd, surreal, atmosphere, one of the guys below me called it ""disjointed"" and that description fits it perfectly. I liked it quite a lot, but I can see why it wouldn't appeal to everyone. The story, the envrioment and the characters are as strange as they are interesting, and even the ""normal"" enemies feel very unique design-wise. Apart from the story, which is very short (I beat it in like 3 hours!), there isn't really anything else to the game. The challenge mode may be able to entertain you for a while, but that's it.Overall, there isn't a lot of content, but the content that's there is very compelling and unique. The game is on sale quite frequently, so if you like brawlers or just games with a very unique and strange atmosphere, you owe it to yourself to pick it up.			"

												A difficult game to review. Having finished the game and looking back and the strange journey that happened I can't help to hope that others experience it to.If you look beyond the bizare art direction, creepy and odd characters, you will find an amazing and bold story. The strength of the art direction is its characters is that it opens up to story. The world is actually kind of beautiful, in its own brutal kind of way. Play it as a medium length shooter, enjoy the story and seeing some quirky and odd characters. GraphicsKind of an older game so don't expect to be blown away. Once you get used to it you really do kind of smile at its strange way of seeing things.GameplayEnjoyable. You advance at a nice pace and the game really makes you feel like you are progressing.SoundHonestly I can't remember the sound. I can't remember being disapointed by it or it grating on me. So theres that.Game LengthId say its medium length. You could get about two to three days out of it. But you can beat it in a sitting if you have time. StoryStrange, enjoyable, if a bit small in scale. It will make you want to shoot them all, and thats all I can ask for in a shooter.Final Score 8/10.A fun, strange shooter that will make you want to see what kind of weird zone you will see next. Characters are bonkers. Bad guys make you want to unload clips into them, good guys will make you want to not kill them. Try it, I recommend it.			"

												Zeno Clash is a fantastic first person fighter in a truly oddball setting. In Zeno Clash, you play as Ghat, one human in a tribe of varying races raised by the asexual creature ""father mother"". After attacking Father Mother, you and your surprisingly loyal ""beetle antlers-in hair"" girlfriend Deadra, have to fight to survive after Father Mother's children come after you.It's a simple story, and Zeno Clash is a odd game in a strange, strange world populated by animal hybrid creatures, odd weapons made out of animal bones and beautiful scenery straight out of an acid trip.Despite all of that oddity though, the game itself is rather easy to get your head around. It's a first person fighter based around punches, kicks, combos, timing and defensive tactics over super moves or memorizing long combos. You will occasionally find weapons which you can use ranging from giant bone swords. to dual fish pistols. to even a really cool rifle made of bone and animal parts. You can use these pretty much for the entirety of a fight as they have infinite ammo (Unlike in Zeno Clash 2), but despite the occasional mandatory weapon section that betrays the game's source engine roots, Zeno Clash is still very much a first person brawler. The combat feels straight up visceral and impactful with just about every swing, block or throw you make. At times it feels a tad sluggish, The combat is fun, but my favorite element of the (admittedly linear) game is exploring this absolutely crazy world. What's interesting about Zeno Clash's setting is that it doesn't seem to be just contrived of an acid trip, genuine world building has been done here and it shows. Areas range from market towns full of thieves to outlands full of sky high elephant-giraffe-anteater-things, to a few areas I would actually rather not spoil, but every one feels fleshed out and varied.Did I mention the game is gorgeous by the way, even now? Colors seem to fade, merge and pop in a way only water color paintings can. This game has some of the prettiest skyboxes I've ever seen, especially for a source game. Overall, the art design is rather excellent. Just about every character, weapon, and creature feels perfectly in line with game's oddball style.It is the first game by an indie studio, so it's not without its rough spots. The voice actor for Deadra isn't all that great, small parts of the combat like recoveries feel a little sluggish, and the limitations of the source engine occasionally crop up, like rather small levels and loading screens halfway through areas. The fish pistols have this odd bug that still has yet to be fixed where the bottom row of bullet indicators is cut in half on the interface. The FOV is non-adjustable, although this is probably to add to immersion and because it changes mid-game actually mid combat. (This is a game where you can see your own feet, it is aiming for immersion.)Overall, Recommendation: If you even think you might like this, buy it. It's cheap at $10 and is well worth your time to at least play through the campaign once. If you are unsure, wishlist it and wait for a sale, as it usually drops down really, really low in price.If you are wondering about cost to time spent ratio, the campaign is about 4+ hours long, but there's tons to go back and see. There's also a Challenge tower that I didn't bother too much with but you may find intriguing.			"

The melee/ranged combat balance is very well done, and the game never gets dull.Now that the good bits are out of the way, let's go straight to the bad/disappointing bits.-The world of Zenozoik looks absolutely fantastic, mostly due to its very unusual, colorful and all-out insane art style.This causes a bit of a problem, which I guess is a very good problem to have : I want to see more of it ! Talk to characters, explore the wilderness , discover weird locations and even weirder inhabitants !Unfortunately, Zeno Clash is a very linear and straightforward game. You move forward, have an enemy encounter, you beat them up, and you repeat until the end of the level.I really wish the game was a standard FPS or had RPG elements that would allow me to explore it. It's such a shame to see what could be an amazing world to explore reduced to a pretty backdrop.-The game is pretty short, it took me about 3.5 hours to finish, without the challenges. This isn't really a problem as i feel it has quite a bit of replay value.-The voice acting is bad. Admittedly, it's bad in a cute way, like Deus Ex but a tad worse. The random use of made up    words like ""kak"" and ""tef"" don't help.-The boat level is boring. Fortunately it barely lasts 2 minutes, but you spend them looking left and right shooting at sand people who are throwing rocks at you.-There is a weird stutter when you move your mouse, it's not very noticeable but nonetheless annoying.-Unskippable cutscenes-The FOV is broken, but I made a guide to fix it : 


Zeno Clash FOV fix ! 
A Guide for Zeno Clash
By: telopots

			Here's a fix for the fov in Zeno Clash !		


Unique, well crafted, and (almost) never boring, the game was a fantastic experience. I enjoyed (almost) every bit of it, and I will probably replay it again at some point.			"

												Good game. Heres some cons and pros..Pros:+ Gameplay is fun.+ First person hand to hand is unique and haven't seen it in other games.+ Story is a bit confusing, but interesting.+ Enemies are all unique and have their own attack sets.+ Graphics are not too bad considering it came out 6 years ago.+ The choice of guns is nice.+ character design is unique and interesting, no two enemies feel alikeCons:- Theres no way to really deal with multiple enemies at once. - Guns have unlimited ammo, so using one can defeat the purpose of hand to hand.- the locking system is flawed, hard to switch between enemies without accidentally turning off.- The fighting combos are a bit limited, gets a little repetive.- Areas are linear, a little open world feeling would be nice. - If enemies get a hold of a gun, they can really do some damage and theres no way of avoiding gunfire. - No replay value whatsoever - awkward animation (sort of like the first Fable)It seems over priced at $9.99. If you don't mind the price, get it. It's best to try and catch it on sale though. Glad I got Zeno Clash 2 Special edition for a mere 5 bucks. Overall a solid 7/10.			"

Learn surprising things about your extended family, and go home with a great lesson learned. I think?This is fun for its weirdness and there's not a lot of First Person Brawlers out there.

												A difficult game to review. Having finished the game and looking back and the strange journey that happened I can't help to hope that others experience it to.If you look beyond the bizare art direction, creepy and odd characters, you will find an amazing and bold story. The strength of the art direction is its characters is that it opens up to story. The world is actually kind of beautiful, in its own brutal kind of way. Play it as a medium length shooter, enjoy the story and seeing some quirky and odd characters. GraphicsKind of an older game so don't expect to be blown away. Once you get used to it you really do kind of smile at its strange way of seeing things.GameplayEnjoyable. You advance at a nice pace and the game really makes you feel like you are progressing.SoundHonestly I can't remember the sound. I can't remember being disapointed by it or it grating on me. So theres that.Game LengthId say its medium length. You could get about two to three days out of it. But you can beat it in a sitting if you have time. StoryStrange, enjoyable, if a bit small in scale. It will make you want to shoot them all, and thats all I can ask for in a shooter.Final Score 8/10.A fun, strange shooter that will make you want to see what kind of weird zone you will see next. Characters are bonkers. Bad guys make you want to unload clips into them, good guys will make you want to not kill them. Try it, I recommend it.			"

												very linear levels with not much exploration. however, the unique graphics, sound, and story more than make up for the lack of level exploration. Each scene is basically a deathmatch versus any number of strange enemies with a brief story intermission before the next battle. The maps for each of these battles is a small arena sized area where you usaually end up kiting with ranged weapons and/or beating baddies senseless with your fists. This is one of the few games where graphics and sound make up for game design in the pure strangeness of it, combined with being dropped into an unknown lore that is bizarre. Highly recommended to play while not sober as it seems it was designed while under the influence of god knows what.			"

												A fast paced brawler that reminded me of older games with a nice mix of hard fighting and annoying rules. A good game by it's own right when you're able to take the bitter pills it makes you swallow. Almost all the combat is hand-to-hand fighting with some guns to play with. This makes for the funnest part of the game play, hard hitting and somewhat tactical combat that you can really get stuck into. However, a boring rail shooting level and 'oh so exciting' sewer level creep in to muck up some ofthe gameplay. The occasional big 'brute' style enemy pops up to force you to play whack-with-stick combat that slows down gameplay annoyingly. HOWEVER, for the fun of the main combat, which you do the most, it's a worthwhile game for the fun brawling focus. Oh, and the story is kinda neat, even if it's really kinda screwy.Pro:-Dayum that brawling combat is fun-The story's twist is kind of interesting, even if...Con:-... It's easy to forget it during the fighting.-Brutes are annoying to fight, but not THAT unpleasantOf note:-Most bosses force you to fight with ranged weapons to beat them, a few force you to know the counter system well without forcing you to use it.-The game's got a decent tutorial that's broken up a bit.-The game is as weird as it is in the screenshots, but it's not THAT 'weird'. Except the storyline is.			"

While the graphics aren't stunning compared to games like Skyrim, it does have a unique approach that feels so realistic. It's a creative game that may be a bit short, yet in and of itself is very filling.I highly suggest buying it, and the sequal. Both are great games that have a great story.			"

												This game is nearly as unique as its environment. It's a first person puncher set int a world that nobody has seen before. It has the potential to change your nightmares and dreams just by looking at the first level. But they didn't stop at just making everything look amazing and unique. They instead went further, making it an excellent fighitng game. While some parts are poorly made, the vast majority of the game is excellent and due to the relatively bite sized episdes of the game, you'll never find yourself hating the game over these small frustrations. If you don't trust me, at least try the demo and you'll see how much stress relief there is for punching a bird in the face. Over and over.			"

												This game is just weirdly addicting. I enjoyed the art style, although very strange, and I thought that the combat was satisfying. Although it's fairly short, I was happy with the game over-all and it left me wanting to play the second game. The story is very weird and possibly off putting to some, (warning: you will fight the same people over and over, but in different circumstances and with new challenges added in) but it comes together in the end fairly well and can be challenging at times.  Seeing as like only 5 guys made this game I was thoroughly impressed and glad that I played it. I'm looking forward to playing the second installment in the coming months. I got them both on a Humble Bundle sell and so far my money was definitely well spent.			"

												ZenoClash is one of those rare games in the industry which doesn't just play follow the leader. It is a truely innovative game and I found it to be a very enjoyable experience. To briefly describe the gameplay, imagine a wrestling game crossed with a first person shooter and dipped in a vat of Salvador Dali's immagination. Basically there are a series of battles in which you use your fists, kicks, grabs and sometimes weapons, both melee and ranged. The systems are complex and feel really rewarding when mastered.  Some may find the systems a little difficult to master, I know it took me several hours of gameplay to begin to feel competent. If you enjoy a challenge that shouldn't put you off this game.The setting is spectacular, very odd and unique and not an art style you see in many games. The world is rich and although there is not a lot of story the world itself and the design of the world makes the game a richer experience.Ran out of room, verdict, BUY IT!			"

												Who is looking for an unique and appealing art style as well as an interesting first-person-beat-em-up game should definitely have a look at this game. Playing as Ghat you have committed a terrible sin and battle your way in a grotesque, astonishing story line. The combat menchanics and handling of the weopons at first feels a bit uncomfortable, however proof to be astonishingly accurate when playing the game for a while. Taking on multiple close and range enemies in combat as well as well placed heavy enemies and boss fights create a superb mixture of adrenalin, tactics and whats most important a lot of fun!			"

												Think ""Double Dragon FPS in a strange alien world"" and you're pretty much there. This games combat system is amazing in its simplicity: Punches, kicks, grapples, parries, dodges and counters are all possible using standard FPS controls. Much like any traditional beat 'em up, the game consists of a simple story presented in a series of stages. Various items are at your disposal, such as unlikely firearms, 'skullbombs' and health pickups.An example of how fights play out:

Combine the skillful combat with a truly bizarre world, good voice acting, some unique weapons, and an intriguing story and you have some pretty good bang for the buck.			"

												Think ""Double Dragon FPS in a strange alien world"" and you're pretty much there. This games combat system is amazing in its simplicity: Punches, kicks, grapples, parries, dodges and counters are all possible using standard FPS controls. Much like any traditional beat 'em up, the game consists of a simple story presented in a series of stages. Various items are at your disposal, such as unlikely firearms, 'skullbombs' and health pickups.An example of how fights play out:

												Mechanics: It's a melee brawler with some wierd but cool looking guns. The fist fighting it really good and I couldn't ask any more or less from it. The guns seem to act like they should: Wood, bones, stone, and some metal all clashed together to make some kind of contraption that shoots skulls or stones.Pacing: It gives you a typical tutorial but makes it a little funny (Useing headless chickens as target practice) and it goes by fairly quickly. You are met with actual combat about a couple minutes into the game and it is challenging and fun. After some 1 v 3 or 1 v 1 fights you are met with a boss, it isn't too hard but it's not too easy so it's a good fight. The pacing in this game seems pretty good and introduces things to you at a good rate.Story: You somehow killed your mother and father and you millions of sisters and brothers are coming to get revenge. They send everything at you to stop you while you escape with what I presume is one of your sisters or a loved one. Voice acting is meh but I don't see that as a bad or a good thing. The story over all seems decent and is sure to be an enjoyable one.Summary: The game so far is very enjoyable. The combat is good and it keeps things new and fun. The story is nothing to praise but it is at least enjoyable. Overall the game is pretty good with few to no problems. I did expirence some lightless ragdolls while I was playing but that is not too big. Graphically, you should't expect much: It's a source game, from and indie dev, and it was made some years back.8/10: Really good game with little problems, it's melee combat is really nice and it's an enjoyable expirence.To clarify: 9/10: spectacular, 10/10 Perfect with little to no problems and was fun and enjoyable throughout every piece of the game. A 5/10 would be like: It's mechanics do what they are suppose to do and the game does nothing special in general. 1/10 would be: I only enjoyed one small part of this game. 0/10 would be KILL ME AND THIS GAME. 8/10 simply just means that It had good mechanics but had nothing special in some other things.

The gameplay makes every battle have weight to them where you have moments of having the advantage and having the disadvantage and is very exciting.

It's not like anything you've played before, from the brawling gameplay to environments that seem drawn alternately from dreams, '60s sci-fi, and the artist getting sunstroke at a busy farm. The game is suggestive and evokes more than it tells, but there seems to be an underlying logic to the enigma of a story on which the game's journey is built. I highly recommend this game. It's cheap, and worth the 5-6 strange hours you'll put into it.			"

O cenário é muito bonito, um mundo de fantasia totalmente maluco, com criaturas e costumes próprios.É um jogo bem diferente, e recomendo que comprem em alguma promoção e que só comprem se realmente curtirem jogos com uma temática diferente.Eu gostei muito do jogo apesar de ser bem curto, achei a história bem legal e bem maluca, por isso recomendo.

												Zeno Clash is good because it's interesting, and not because it's particularly well made. It doesn't prooperlysupport controllers without some config file tweaking and even then you need a mouse to load your save. The easy difficulty can get pretty hard and autosaves can put you in a tough spot (fortunately, there's two so you can go back a bit further). The combat is interesting, although I found it hard to dodge because it's a two-action sequence (block and then move) instead of a chord or single button. For controller users, there's no auto-aim for ranged weapons, I couldn't get the sensitivity low enough for precise aiming, and the reticle is hard to see so shooting can be difficult.There's other minor things that feel unpolished like delays after finishing a fight where nothing happens and the bad voice acting of the main character, but I still like Zeno Clash because it feels so different. Your companion's voice acting is great, many of the other characters are good, the mix of melee and ranged combat works well enough, the world is beautiful and strange, and the struggle of the protagonist (while not sold through the acting) is interesting and isn't the standards save-the-world cliche.I finished the game on easy with a controller, but used buddha mode (through the console) to get through some tough battles (like the infuriating Hunter).

												A very wierd but very fun little game.  There aren't alot of first person adventure/fighting games out there - probably for good reason - the mechanics are a bit strange and hard to get used to, but they can be alot of fun once you get into the swing of things.The real highlight for this game, however, is the colorful and original world it is set in.  The blurb calls it ""punk-fantasy,"" which falls pretty short of quantifying just how oddball this game is.  The strange characters, fantastic creatures, and bizzare weapons all feel like they are referencing a deep and well established mythology - but one that is almost entirely alien to me.There are a few issues with focus and pacing but overall this is a great game that is worth the $15 sticker price.  8/10			"

												Zeno Clash is a rather unique take on the first-person view one commonly sees nowadays in the FPS genre. It's a first-person fighter, where the player ends up using his fists more than handmade weapons. The world of Zenozoic is one where metal is hardly seen; in its place is bone, stone and preserved guts, forming an incredibly strange world where clans vie for power. Rooster blood has the same effect as alcohol here and everyone knows fisticuffs - coincidence? I think not. The storyline seemed a bit lacking, but the gameplay is where it's at. A challenge worthy of any gamer worth his salt.			"

												Picked this up during the Christmas sale because it looked interesting, and found that I was completely ashamed for not getting it earlier.  Excellent game, unique and finely crafted atmosphere, imaginative story, and a blast to play.  Not just a highly competent shooter, but also features the very best first-person hand-to-hand combat in any game I've ever played.			"

												Imagine if Dr.Seuss' muddle puddle tweetle poodle beetle noodle bottle paddle battle was real, and more like Thunder Dome from Mad Max. Now you've got Zeno Clash.It's a highly stylized first person brawler. It feels kind of odd to put that much detail and style into something that you don't look at while you punch everyone, but when you have time to stop to smell the blood spattered roses, it's a nice looking place. The story is a bit meh, and just goes so deep into this worlds bizzare lore that it gets a bit muddled. Really it's just for playing through once and going ""well that was interesting"", then never touching it again.Lets hope Zeno Clash 2 is better.On the other hand, if Zeno Clash 2 is set in the same world, maybe playing this just to get into the lore would be a good idea.

												This game is nearly as unique as its environment. It's a first person puncher set int a world that nobody has seen before. It has the potential to change your nightmares and dreams just by looking at the first level. But they didn't stop at just making everything look amazing and unique. They instead went further, making it an excellent fighitng game. While some parts are poorly made, the vast majority of the game is excellent and due to the relatively bite sized episdes of the game, you'll never find yourself hating the game over these small frustrations. If you don't trust me, at least try the demo and you'll see how much stress relief there is for punching a bird in the face. Over and over.			"

												An absolute gorgeous first-person brawler. The character designs and artwork is straight out of a Jim Henson movie like the Dark Crystal. The fighting mechanics are thought out but never too complicated.  The story mode is very short, about 5 hours or so don't expect an epic story. Speaking of story, this is one of the most bizarre games I have EVER played. Check out the demo, I'm sure you won't regret it.			"

												This game is quirky, weird and even fringing on the world of creepy. Its certainly a unique take on the first person fighting genre. Aside from games that involve you fighting in a ring, the game provides dynamic environments and exploration albeit in linear progression. However the combat and world is just different enough to keep me on board for the entirety of the story. The problem with the game is that the story ends up with a rather stupid and obvious twist and that the story can be beaten in 4 hours. Since I beat the game I have not picked it up, but always consider playing it again.			"

Maybe if you have been on acid and LSD simultaneously, you might have a clue. The characters, monsters, story, weapons, and scenery are just plain crazy. With a decent melee combat system, it's hard not to recommend it. Just don't play it with any far fetched expectations and stick with it to the end.

												This game is weird, just so damn weird. I have fun playing it as the combat mechanics is new although I wont say spectacular. The characters, setting and soundtrack etc on the other hand are as I said above weird, it is as if someone created the game by joining pieces of his dreams together. I would recommend this game had it not been so buggy.,,,,and the bugs are too glaring to ignore. The hit detection is ridiculously absurd, enemies fall into planes where you cant reach them, the triggered events do not trigger ( twice in a row in a climatic part of the game)....and heck even the credits are buggy......Play this game only if you want something different but if you want a nice experience, I wouldnt recommend,.Plus it is short, my hours are due to me farming cards.

												very linear levels with not much exploration. however, the unique graphics, sound, and story more than make up for the lack of level exploration. Each scene is basically a deathmatch versus any number of strange enemies with a brief story intermission before the next battle. The maps for each of these battles is a small arena sized area where you usaually end up kiting with ranged weapons and/or beating baddies senseless with your fists. This is one of the few games where graphics and sound make up for game design in the pure strangeness of it, combined with being dropped into an unknown lore that is bizarre. Highly recommended to play while not sober as it seems it was designed while under the influence of god knows what.			"

												Zeno Clash is a rather unique take on the first-person view one commonly sees nowadays in the FPS genre. It's a first-person fighter, where the player ends up using his fists more than handmade weapons. The world of Zenozoic is one where metal is hardly seen; in its place is bone, stone and preserved guts, forming an incredibly strange world where clans vie for power. Rooster blood has the same effect as alcohol here and everyone knows fisticuffs - coincidence? I think not. The storyline seemed a bit lacking, but the gameplay is where it's at. A challenge worthy of any gamer worth his salt.			"

												A difficult game to review. Having finished the game and looking back and the strange journey that happened I can't help to hope that others experience it to.If you look beyond the bizare art direction, creepy and odd characters, you will find an amazing and bold story. The strength of the art direction is its characters is that it opens up to story. The world is actually kind of beautiful, in its own brutal kind of way. Play it as a medium length shooter, enjoy the story and seeing some quirky and odd characters. GraphicsKind of an older game so don't expect to be blown away. Once you get used to it you really do kind of smile at its strange way of seeing things.GameplayEnjoyable. You advance at a nice pace and the game really makes you feel like you are progressing.SoundHonestly I can't remember the sound. I can't remember being disapointed by it or it grating on me. So theres that.Game LengthId say its medium length. You could get about two to three days out of it. But you can beat it in a sitting if you have time. StoryStrange, enjoyable, if a bit small in scale. It will make you want to shoot them all, and thats all I can ask for in a shooter.Final Score 8/10.A fun, strange shooter that will make you want to see what kind of weird zone you will see next. Characters are bonkers. Bad guys make you want to unload clips into them, good guys will make you want to not kill them. Try it, I recommend it.			"

												Zeno Clash is good because it's interesting, and not because it's particularly well made. It doesn't prooperlysupport controllers without some config file tweaking and even then you need a mouse to load your save. The easy difficulty can get pretty hard and autosaves can put you in a tough spot (fortunately, there's two so you can go back a bit further). The combat is interesting, although I found it hard to dodge because it's a two-action sequence (block and then move) instead of a chord or single button. For controller users, there's no auto-aim for ranged weapons, I couldn't get the sensitivity low enough for precise aiming, and the reticle is hard to see so shooting can be difficult.There's other minor things that feel unpolished like delays after finishing a fight where nothing happens and the bad voice acting of the main character, but I still like Zeno Clash because it feels so different. Your companion's voice acting is great, many of the other characters are good, the mix of melee and ranged combat works well enough, the world is beautiful and strange, and the struggle of the protagonist (while not sold through the acting) is interesting and isn't the standards save-the-world cliche.I finished the game on easy with a controller, but used buddha mode (through the console) to get through some tough battles (like the infuriating Hunter).

It has a unique art style, which is very tripy, that works really well with the gameplay. -Not to sound like a pothead or anything, but playing this game under the influence of the green is awesome- Dialogues are O.K. I guess... Gameplay is gold.I'd give it a 8/10, considering they approched shooters in a different way.			"

The gameplay makes every battle have weight to them where you have moments of having the advantage and having the disadvantage and is very exciting. The story is decently simple and does not try to be more than it can handle. Overall it is a good short indie game and i highly recommended for anyone interested in games with latin american/hispanic influence.			"

The combat system is pretty decent, some troubles locking on targets but punching and kicking those weirdos gives a lot of satisfaction :) everyone talks about the story, to be honest the story isn't deep at all, even if the figure of father-mother is really intriguing (and disturbing?). What really makes this game is its art-style... Man this game's characters, locations and animals are crazily original and amazing. The game is really short but it's a blessing because the gameplay becomes very repetitive after a while. Definitely worth 1€, maybe even more			"

												Awesome game. Best parts are fighting mechanics and graphic stylization and just overal originality. There is quite nice variety of enemies to fight. There is a change of gameplay here and there from meele fighting to on rail shooter or walking around with magic wand. Too bad game itself is quite short, i finished entire campaing in over 3 hours. But entire time i was stuned by population variety, architecture of many places, this was world combinig your wildest fantasies and wraping it in insane originality. Story or chatacters ain't exactly deep but what we have is extremly exciting, interesting and makes you want to know more about this world and it's story, i finished game in one long gameplay and enjoyed nearly every minutre of it. There was one annoying part with shooting flying exploding squirrels (yes that's in game) but meh, that's just minor complaint. There is also sweet variety of unique ranged weapons which if you used properly can become your main weapon instead of your fists and combos.			"

												*Possible Spoilers Below, but not really*Punched my way to the literal end of the earth and back in about 3 hours.Enjoyed every second of it. Dont let the short length fool you. This is a fun pc beat em up shooter thing!A few fights are quite tough, the weapons are interesting, your female sidekick has smoking hot legs and gives you something to stare at while out and about doing your thing, and the story didnt really confuse me at all, there are some things not explained and im sure the sequel will adress those things but what you are presented with while weird, does eventually peace together, leaving some remaining questions after the cliff hanger ending. LIKE!Why does this world even exist in the first place, and why so many strange creatures along side humans.What exactly was mother father doing before the intro scene that kicks all this stuff off, i mean sure we get a semi answer, but still. Like what? Wheres the motive.Are the 2 main characters going to get it on and have like a son or something. Im sure theres already fan fiction of that. Wouldnt shock me.How many punches would it take to get to the centre of the planet? ID LIKE TO KNOW!And what are all those things we were promised info on in the end of the game, sequel perhaps? (downloading the second game as i type this)ANYWAYS, silly questions about a silly but entertaining plot aside. Just uh, buy this ok. Seriosly get both. I want a third game. I want a nice ZENO TRILOGY, to come back to and enjoy. 2 OUT OF 3 FOLKS. JUST ONE MORE GAME AND THE DREAM WOULD BECOME REAL! LEZ GO NOW!			"

												You can beat a fat cannibalistic  pig man named Gaben like he ows you money. (is there something you'd like to admit ACE team?)Seriously though, I love the David Cronenberg-esque aesthetics. The story is confusing, but it fits the wierdness of the aesthetics. The game is the first video game to make me feel like I'm in a fight. the hits are bone-crunching and very satisfying. There are very few FPS games like this. Makes great use of an old engine. It's funny, but my only criticism so far is that the shooting and aiming are not that great, wierd since it's the same engine Valve used to make Half-Life 2 and co.I really recommend this game. I don't think there is a first person braweler like this except for the hand-to-hand combat in Morrowind.			"

												Pros: Bizarre, unexpected, tons of personality and a lot of fun. Visceral first-person melee mechanics make combat very unique and engaging. Nightmarish character design and creepy voicework contributes highly to the game's fascinatingly surreal ambience.Cons: The small levels and strict linearity in progression are disappointing since the world's imaginative environments would be a blast to explore. Also, gamplay can feel repetitive at times since other than dialogue, there is little to break up the consecutive bouts of combat. Some elements of adventuring and exploration would add much to the experience. The game is a bit on the short side with the main story clocking in at about 4-5 hours.Overall, Zeno Clash is well worth playing and is an experience that is sure to stick with you.

												Zeno Clash can be summarized in two words - freaky weird. Imaginative setting that somehow manages to give the impression that you've only just scratched the surface of the world of Zenozoik (and beyond) along with its eerily disturbing and eccentric characters result in a unique experience overall. That's not to say everything deserves praise though, especially in the mechanics department. First-person melee combat is awkward especially with its overreliance on somewhat stubborn focus mode that takes some time getting used to in order to avoid frustration. Not to mention how short the game is, probably as a result of obviously being ACE Team's first effort and consequence their choice to go for a surreal one-time experience.			"

Although there are a few weapons in the game the combat system is centered around melee combat. The system felt slightly clunky at first, but wasn't bad at all once I got used to it. The story and characters in this game are just as bizarre and fantastical as the setting.Although you can beat the campaign in about 4 hours, I would still highly recomend this game.

												Zeno clash is without a doubt the weirdest game I have ever played, in the most positive sense. The absurdistic world that you venture through never ceased to surprise me, and is at times strangely familiar. The music in Zenoclash is as weird as everything else in this game, and really seals the atmosphere. The voice acting sounds a bit shoddy though, although that might be intentional. I'm not really sure if it's a good or a bad thing, but I suppose it's another small contributor to the strangest, most bizare atmosphere you will ever encounter in a computergame. The game offers a unique experience to the player. The game may be a bit short, (you can probably finish the game in about 5 hours or so) but after finishing the storyline, you can also give the ""tower challenges"" a try. The tower challenges are basically a sort of gauntlet in which you fight against all the enemies which you have encountered during the storyline. I would give this game 78/100.			"

												Zeno Clash can be summarized in two words - freaky weird. Imaginative setting that somehow manages to give the impression that you've only just scratched the surface of the world of Zenozoik (and beyond) along with its eerily disturbing and eccentric characters result in a unique experience overall. That's not to say everything deserves praise though, especially in the mechanics department. First-person melee combat is awkward especially with its overreliance on somewhat stubborn focus mode that takes some time getting used to in order to avoid frustration. Not to mention how short the game is, probably as a result of obviously being ACE Team's first effort and consequence their choice to go for a surreal one-time experience.			"

												If you're in the mood for the bizarre you have to try this game. It is set in a fantastical fantasy world with environment and creatures unlike anything I've ever seen. Although there are a few weapons in the game the combat system is centered around melee combat. The system felt slightly clunky at first, but wasn't bad at all once I got used to it. The story and characters in this game are just as bizarre and fantastical as the setting.Although you can beat the campaign in about 4 hours, I would still highly recomend this game. I found it refreshingly different from any other game I have ever played.			"

												Quirky and original, Zeno Clash brings beat-em-ups into a twisted Stone Age. The environments are lively and the characters give the game an offbeat personality. The game's combat is brutally fun, but also full of missed potential. The game's short length doesn't help either.			"

Seriously, Zeno Clash simply breathes creativity.

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Zeno Clash is a weird game, it's one of those games that is weird and unique in it's own way. Zeno Clash is developed and published by ACE Team, the same people behind the wonderful rock game Rock of Ages, this was there first ever game and it was developed using Valve's Source engine which you can tell from the settings menu and subtitlesThe story follows Ghat as he is one of the thousands of brothers and sisters of Father-Mother, the game starts as you see Father-Mother die right before you're eyes, however, that's not the end of him-her. And after you run away from you're family, you will find out some secrets regarding your Father-Mother. The story isn't the best but get's the job doneThe game's graphics are wonderful. Weird and creepy but magnificent and unique, although the game uses the Source engine, you can't tell except from the settings menu and subtitles. All the environments, characters and enemies are unique in their own way and I praise ACE Team for making such a weird but unique game!The music and sound are also top notch, very well composed. The only thing I would complain about is the combat and gunplay. It's awkward and hard to fight enemies, plus you get hit from all sides which if you're own low health, you'd be dead in an instant, also, whilst fighting you focus on one enemy and that enemy only, and if you need to move away to find some health you can't...Another thing I would complain about is the length, it's short and I finished the game in one whole sitting. If it were a bit longer I wouldn't have complained about the length, but maybe it's a good thingOverall, Zeno Clash is an odd yet fun game to play in one whole sitting, and if you are looking for more, why not play it's sequel Zeno Clash 2 after playing the first one! RECOMMENDED :)  "

												This game is weird, just so damn weird. I have fun playing it as the combat mechanics is new although I wont say spectacular. The characters, setting and soundtrack etc on the other hand are as I said above weird, it is as if someone created the game by joining pieces of his dreams together. I would recommend this game had it not been so buggy.,,,,and the bugs are too glaring to ignore. The hit detection is ridiculously absurd, enemies fall into planes where you cant reach them, the triggered events do not trigger ( twice in a row in a climatic part of the game)....and heck even the credits are buggy......Play this game only if you want something different but if you want a nice experience, I wouldnt recommend,.Plus it is short, my hours are due to me farming cards.

												I think this game has my favourite setting of any game I've played. It manages to combine a native, pre-historic setting with post apocalyptic themes. Every area you visit is unique and stunning to look at. The game progresses linearly, going from one area to another fighting a handful of enemies. This may sound dull, but the combat is excellent. I can only compare it to dark souls and chivalry. You won't get by just spamming the hit button, you'll need to use your surroundings, kite your enemies (who will gang up on you otherwise), block and dodge. The weapons are also quite fun to use and vary enough that you won't get bored using the same ones over and over. The only weakness in the combat was the boss' and big enemies. They all use the same ai which can easily be beaten by just running circles around them whilst hitting them repeatedly. The story is interesting and actually made me want to find out what happened and the ending feels very rewarding. Git it. "

												The way I see it, there four strong reasons to get this game:1) The art style is gorgeous. The set design is great and the environments are enormously varied from chapter to chapter and scene to scene. It is thematically coherent but at the same time constantly surprising. Many of the locations are designed to evoke feelings, and are very immersive.2) The story is involving! The plot is cohesive and engaging. The characters are well-written and multifaceted, with growth over the story arc. It didn't take long for me to find myself showing concern for the wellbeing of these characters, in particular that of the female lead.3) Game mechanics are different. Although this game is at heart an FPS, most of your combat will be brawling. The melee fighting system is different but interesting, and challenging enough to keep you interested through the game.4) Source Engine! Yes Zeno Clash uses the same engine as HL2. It's familiar, you know how it acts, and it feels right.Recommended.			"

												This game is pretty cool. I think it is worth picking up on a sale (it's usually 0.99 on a sale) but i personally got it in a bundle.But it is not perfect, it is supposed to be a first person fighting game, but yet there are so much guns, that alot of times the fighting feels unnecassary, especially when you get the dual wield pistols. Those things have alot of ammo and they can be reloaded in a second. So you can just sit in a corner mowing everyone down. They could of made ammo limited making gunplay situational, instead you have never ending suplies of ammo. Otherwise this game is short and sweet and overall enjoyable. (The ending was pretty cool too imo.)			"

												I replayed this game I bought long ago and am going to write this reviewThis game has skilled fighting mechanics with a story that doesn't really make sense until you play further in a world beyond anything I can imagine. The story immerses you in a different reality and leaves you wanting more. It's for sure worth 10 bucks and I can't wait to buy and play the sequel to this game!			"

												Zeno Clash is a fantastic first person fighter in a truly oddball setting. In Zeno Clash, you play as Ghat, one human in a tribe of varying races raised by the asexual creature ""father mother"". After attacking Father Mother, you and your surprisingly loyal ""beetle antlers-in hair"" girlfriend Deadra, have to fight to survive after Father Mother's children come after you.It's a simple story, and Zeno Clash is a odd game in a strange, strange world populated by animal hybrid creatures, odd weapons made out of animal bones and beautiful scenery straight out of an acid trip.Despite all of that oddity though, the game itself is rather easy to get your head around. It's a first person fighter based around punches, kicks, combos, timing and defensive tactics over super moves or memorizing long combos. You will occasionally find weapons which you can use ranging from giant bone swords. to dual fish pistols. to even a really cool rifle made of bone and animal parts. You can use these pretty much for the entirety of a fight as they have infinite ammo (Unlike in Zeno Clash 2), but despite the occasional mandatory weapon section that betrays the game's source engine roots, Zeno Clash is still very much a first person brawler. The combat feels straight up visceral and impactful with just about every swing, block or throw you make. At times it feels a tad sluggish, The combat is fun, but my favorite element of the (admittedly linear) game is exploring this absolutely crazy world. What's interesting about Zeno Clash's setting is that it doesn't seem to be just contrived of an acid trip, genuine world building has been done here and it shows. Areas range from market towns full of thieves to outlands full of sky high elephant-giraffe-anteater-things, to a few areas I would actually rather not spoil, but every one feels fleshed out and varied.Did I mention the game is gorgeous by the way, even now? Colors seem to fade, merge and pop in a way only water color paintings can. This game has some of the prettiest skyboxes I've ever seen, especially for a source game. Overall, the art design is rather excellent. Just about every character, weapon, and creature feels perfectly in line with game's oddball style.It is the first game by an indie studio, so it's not without its rough spots. The voice actor for Deadra isn't all that great, small parts of the combat like recoveries feel a little sluggish, and the limitations of the source engine occasionally crop up, like rather small levels and loading screens halfway through areas. The fish pistols have this odd bug that still has yet to be fixed where the bottom row of bullet indicators is cut in half on the interface. The FOV is non-adjustable, although this is probably to add to immersion and because it changes mid-game actually mid combat. (This is a game where you can see your own feet, it is aiming for immersion.)Overall, Recommendation: If you even think you might like this, buy it. It's cheap at $10 and is well worth your time to at least play through the campaign once. If you are unsure, wishlist it and wait for a sale, as it usually drops down really, really low in price.If you are wondering about cost to time spent ratio, the campaign is about 4+ hours long, but there's tons to go back and see. There's also a Challenge tower that I didn't bother too much with but you may find intriguing.			"

												A very strange surreal FPS beat-em-up. Short length, could be played through in its entirety in one sitting, which is perfectly fine in this case. Combat is complex enough to allow for reflex based reactions and fights, but simplsitic enough to where if you can't grasp that, simple stick and moving can win the day too.The entire game's art direction is creative and altogether ""Weird"", but everything feels weird for a reason - even if that reason is never actually explained to you.While there are some snags to gameplay (being forced to circle strafe ""big"" enemies to hit them with a club is simply boring, and you do it a good number of times.), it's not a long enough game for it to drag. It answers just enough questions while opening up more, but still feels like it can stand on its own.It's short enough to be an easy recommendation for anyone who likes short, relatively simple action games, or has a taste at all for the weird.

												Now I know I put a thumbs down, but I don't actually think this game is bad. I see lots of potentional in it, but it's very hard to play. I couldn't go more than 2 hours at a time, for it made my head hurt and stomach churn, and I normally don't get sick from playing games. That being said, if you can stand reallly bad camera angles, terrible voice acting, and awkward controls, you'll absolutely love the game. Where this game really shines, is the art style. Now now, I didn't say graphics, I think even for 2009, the graphics is very dated. The art design of the forrest, desert, outfits, and especially guns, are extremely intresting. My personal favorite is the crossbow, the way you reload what I presume to be skulls, and the sight of the weapon itself. Gameplay is extremely repetitive, and although you do go through this weird tutorial thing, you pretty much have access to everything you can do from the get go. I can't say the game isn't fast paced, but I think the best way to put the gameplay is ""clonky"". This is especially the case when you lock onto an enemy. I pretty much stopped locking to targets because of how hard it is to play, and not in challenging way, but in an impossible kinda way. Another thing I absolutely hate is that there isn't jumping in the game, which bothers me a lot. Although, to be fair, the level design doesn't need jumping. I recommend this for anyone who wants to try something different, but be warned, I'm not sure I mean it in a good way. That's thing, I'm just, not sure about this game. I think with some stealth, more fluidity to movement, better point of view, a more introcet locking system, some form of skill tree to keep gameplay fresh, and maybe some RPG elements, this game would be outstanding. Oh and I almost forgot, better voices and animation, for the love of God I've seen gay TF2 SFMs better than this♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

The combat system is pretty decent, some troubles locking on targets but punching and kicking those weirdos gives a lot of satisfaction :) everyone talks about the story, to be honest the story isn't deep at all, even if the figure of father-mother is really intriguing (and disturbing?). What really makes this game is its art-style... Man this game's characters, locations and animals are crazily original and amazing. The game is really short but it's a blessing because the gameplay becomes very repetitive after a while. Definitely worth 1€, maybe even more			"

Zeno Clash is one of those games that appear just once or twice in a generation. No matter whether you loved it, hated it, or felt nothing at all about it after playing, you remember this game. It's not only the visual design of characters and environments which is truly out of this world; it's not only the quirkiness of characters' voices and personalities and behaviours; it's not just the sinister, disturbing story with its moments of light-hearted insanity; and it's not the peculiar fighting system that will both annoy and delight in equal amounts. Zeno Clash is one of the rare cases where the components intertwine and inexplicably form a whole that's more than the mere sum-of-parts. I can't really find any other game released this side of 2005 that creates so much indescribable and memorable weirdness. ACE Team are masters of such experiences in gaming. That's why Zeno Clash belongs to my personal category of ""get copies on as many platforms as possible"" - it's totally unique. If life and work permitted, I would replay this as soon as possible.

The Game itself is very interesting. From its game design, to crazy characters , weird looking world and interesting story line. The main character was nothing crazy and his side character doesnt do much. The voice acting is a hit and miss in this game. Somtimes its good somtimes its bad. Its a fun game but has alot to fix. Targetting can get annoying when u are fighting more then one enemy. Or when u are trying to run away or back away somtimes ur lock doesnt come off. Thats my biggest complaint with this game. Also the run time is really short. Like I said it only took me 3 hours to beat. Not worth $10. Had an alright twist at the end but it deff makes me wanna play the 2nd game.			"
